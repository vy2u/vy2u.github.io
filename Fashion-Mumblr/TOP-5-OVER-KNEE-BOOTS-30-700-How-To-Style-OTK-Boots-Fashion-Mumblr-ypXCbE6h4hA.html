me for today's video I've had a few
requests lately to do something around
overni boots because I have been wearing
them so much
ever since autumn really started to kick
in on recent trips in recent Look Books
I have to spend obsessed with over knee
boots and for good reason I feel like
they are such a versatile piece for the
Wardrobe they've really helped to
elevate an outfit and they come back
into style season after season year
after year so personally I think that
makes them a really great investment
this year I have a few new over knee
boots to add to my collection so I
thought I'd do a video all around the
style in today's video I'm going to be
sharing my top 5 favorite styles these
are ranging from the high street at
around the 30 pound price points are
very affordable although you upstairs
more premium investment pieces which are
going all the way up to around 700
pounds I'm going to be sharing some tips
on how to care for them if you're
spending that amount of money you want
these boots to last for years and years
so I'll be sharing my tips on how I look
after my boots and also tips on how to
style them there are so many different
outfit combinations you can create with
over new boots
so I'm going to share a few tips on that
as well before I get started if you love
fashion videos and you'd like to see
more from me then please hit the thumbs
up button and it really makes my day if
you hit thumbs up and also subscribe to
my channel if you are new for loads more
fashion I have tons of fabulous support
videos planned for you so make sure to
hit subscribe if you are new and without
further ado let's get started so when it
comes to oogie new boots I find that I
get the most use out of them when they
are in neutral colors and for me neutral
over knee boots is black beige tan and
gray they are the four colors that I
personally think go the best with the
majority of things in my wardrobe and if
you have a wardrobe similar to mine or
if you just love neutrals which I think
90% of population do then they are the
most practical colorway to opt for when
it comes to over new boots this pair
would you believe are actually the most
affordable in my top 5 these come in at
32 pounds which i think is absolutely
incredible
you probably wouldn't have guessed it
before I mentioned that because I think
they have a very very high-end look
about them well I really love about
these
that the heel is the same material as
the rest of the boots so these are faux
suede and I think that that just really
kind of draws them all in together as
opposed to a pair I'm going to show you
next which is from Zara where the heel
is wooden I think that that's just not
quite as lovely as when they're all the
same material you'll find with a lot of
over new boots that they have this
section going up here which really helps
to elongate the leg and what I would
look for when choosing over new boots
especially on the more budget side of
things is what the lining is made of so
I made a mistake I think it was last
autumn winter or the year before where I
chose a pair that were not majorly
budget they were from at the high street
but I think I paid around 120 pounds of
them and they had a beautiful sateen eat
silk lining which on the leg when I put
them on was great but I found I was
constantly hiking them up having to pull
them up every two minutes no matter
whether I wore jeans or tights or bare
legs because the material inside was so
soft they felt great but they were
always falling down which was a real
pain and they just didn't look great so
I look for something a little bit more
rough this isn't rough at all but it's
just a little bit more grippy you can
kind of feel it's a little bit spongy
and that is something to look for
especially in these lower price point
boots because you don't want them
bagging up all around ankles because
that is just not a flattering look as
they are first weighed it means that
they have a little bit more stretch to
them which is great because you do want
them to fit your leg as neatly as
possible and then they've got this tie
at the top this is the only bit that I
do find a little bit annoying on these
because this keeps coming up and down I
have to tie in a double knot which when
it comes to taking them off is a little
bit of a pain they have a concealed zip
which is great and overall I think this
color is absolutely beautiful I have
been styling these with jumper dresses
over jeans with denim skirts so many
ways to style them incredibly versatile
so they are my number one of my top five
openi boots so we are working our way up
when it comes to price point these are
the next ones up when it comes to price
points and these are from Zara I got
these last autumn winter and I'm afraid
to say I couldn't find them on the Zara
website I'm hoping and praying they come
back
I've been wearing these so much and so
many of you guys have been asking about
them in this photo which I have featured
quite a lot on my Instagram I get so
many questions about the boots they look
a lot like these Stuart Weitzman
Highline boots but they were in actual
fact I think 70 pounds from Zara if not
more affordable than that I absolutely
adore these they fit really beautifully
they never fall down or go baggy they've
got a little bit more detail at the back
here down the previous ones I've got a
bit more of a corset style finish which
just helps to stretch them a little bit
better at the top here also it really
love the length of these they do go
quite high up the thigh which when it
comes to styling it personally I really
love because I don't like having my next
up too much I'm a little bit too prudish
for that but when it comes to wearing
shorter skirts I find that these make
the skirts really versatile really easy
to wear a little bit more modest and
ladylike when you have a little bit more
covered up the thigh
thanks to lovely boot such as this as I
said the only bit that I'm not such a
huge fan of is the heel the wooden heel
I think just makes them look a little
bit cheaper but still really really
happy with the price point if I paid for
these hopefully they'll come back into
stock if they do I'll leave them the
link down below everything that I
mentioned in this video of course will
be linked in the description box so just
click show more for all the links and
information so my third pair are these
beautiful darker gray faux suede and
these ones have got slightly more of a
pointed toe which I think is the style
that comes in and out a little bit less
classic but this time of year this
season they are very much in style
pointed toe I think it's a really
elegant look and can definitely add a
few more style points to your outfit of
the day as I mentioned these the first
way so again you get that yes this team
meaning they fit really beautifully and
these ones these ones are around 75
pounds they are very new to the high
street so definitely plenty of stock
again I'll leave them linked down below
but they are very very high so these
come up again mid thigh level they are
quite tight going all the way up you
don't really have that much
adjustability if that makes sense
because they don't have any tie at the
top it's just the same material all the
way up and down when it comes to comfort
something that I
I mentioned with all the previous boots
but that is true also these ones is that
I like to go for a chunky block heel of
course you can get over new boots the
stilettos you can get all different
kinds of heels but I personally like a
chunky block heel I find it the most
comfortable for wearing all day and it
still gives me that height boost that
I'm most definitely need so chunky heels
are the one for me as these more
affordable ones are faux suede there are
slightly different ways of caring for
them personally if I get them muddy or
dirt in any way I just like to use a dry
brush when the boot is completely dry
don't try doing anything when the boot
is wet because it might mess up the
material when the boot is dry I just
like to use a dry brush to kind of brush
away any dirt or dust that has got on
them on that note another caring tip
would of course be to check the weather
forecast
I find that suede boots that are made
with real suede are actually very
versatile they're a lot more hard
wearing than we often give them credit
for if they are cared for correctly but
first weight can be a little bit more
temperamental this is the brush that I
like to use for my first weigh boots it
is slightly it's softer bristle than
what I would use on my real suede ones
but it's really good for just brushing
away any dust any dirt from the day and
keeping your boots looking good these
next ones are a little bit of a price
jump so all of the previous ones have
been under 100 pounds I would say that
the next price level up would probably
be cut Giger they have a really
beautiful selection I don't have any
here but they are around the 120 to 150
pound price mark and I do love them but
the next ones in my top 5 are these
beautiful beautiful boots from Karen
Millen they are a beautiful slightly
darker gray suede and they are just the
most comfortable boots that I own pretty
much because they have got a slightly
lower heel because they have got a
slightly lower heel than the ones I
showed you previously they're great for
days when I know I'm going to be doing a
lot of walking a lot of shopping
potentially because the heel is slightly
lower and more chunky than the previous
pairs when you pay a little bit more you
do get that expert craftsmanship in this
kind of boot so these have got a little
bit more structure around the ankle
keeps you nicely supported so you're not
going to be toppling over when you're
wearing them which is of course a bonus
they have a much higher quality zip
fastening
the previous ones and the zip is
completely hidden so when there's enough
you can't see the zip at all which if
you compare it to the more affordable
ones such as these Zara ones the zip is
always on display it's not quite as
visually appealing as the caramel and
where those zip is completely hidden
once again you don't need to worry about
any laces cutting and doníts they don't
have any laces at the top but I would
say that these are quite tight-fitting
so definitely wants to try on in store
if you're not too sure if they're going
to fit you perfectly but having said
that they do still have a little bit of
stretch and elasticity in the suede when
you are spending this amount of money on
a pair of boots of course you want to
wear them a lot you want to get a lot of
use out of them and really get that
price per wear down so what's very
important to me is that these have got a
really great sole on them as you can see
it's a quite thick sole if you compare a
game to the more affordable ones the
sole is really reinforced here it means
that for years and years you're going to
get such good use out of these and
they're not going to look worn while the
more affordable ones may look worn after
a season or two of use and then speaking
of a season or two of use we have my
fifth top five and the most expensive of
a lot now I think these are called
the all Jill boot they are suede at the
front and then a more elasticated
material at the back which as you can
imagine means the fit is absolutely
perfect and they are so incredibly
comfortable I invested in these a couple
of winters ago and the reason why I
chose this style was because I thought
if I'm going to sending that amount of
money and these have gone up in price
since I bought them they are now almost
700 pounds so very very expensive very
premium if you're spending that amount
of money you want to buy something that
is incredibly class incredibly versatile
so for that reason that I chose to get a
black pair of over knee boots from
Stuart Weitzman the heel height on these
is absolutely beautiful I find this is
just about the right height that gives
me the boost that I want but it's still
very wearable I find these incredibly
comfortable and on that note it's worth
mentioning but they actually have a
little bit of a platform on the sole
here which gives your all of your foot a
bit of a high boost which takes away a
little bit of a
and the heels are just overall very very
comfortable again that they have a
little bit more reinforcement around the
ankle so a lot more stable to wear and I
have taken good care of these over the
past couple of years so they're still
looking really really good there's no
bumps there's no scratches on them or
anything so on that note I'm gonna share
a few tips on how I care for my opening
bits so when it comes to caring for your
over knee boots it is really really
important that you have them the day
that you buy them there's nothing worse
than going out and a brand new pair of
suede boots and ruining them on the
first go here in the UK
whether it's very unpredictable I will
always check my phone to check the
forecast but you never know if there's
going to be a little bit of drizzle so
what I like to do is use a suede spray
the very day that I buy them one that
Charlie always recommends and raves
about is this one called liquid proof I
think it might be a Dragon's Den thing I
have a feeling they were flogging the
little mini vials of it but I get it on
Amazon I buy these big squirty protector
sprays and this is actually a really
good no matter whether it's real suede
or faux suede
it's called liquid proof and it
literally is if you put a drop of water
on your suede boots it will be as though
the water has gone on glass it'll just
run off there is nothing going to
penetrate your boots if you spray with
this so I like to kind of miss the boots
all over like this the day that I get
them and then I'll do this again if it
looks like it's gonna rain that day and
I definitely want to wear my boots I'll
miss them one more time before I head
out so definitely recommend picking up
some of this if you've already worn the
boots tiny need to respray them then
definitely I'd recommend brushing the
boots first want to kind of brush back
and forth to really raise the fibers of
the suede or the faux suede this will
not only get out and he dust but it'll
just help to make the suede look fresh
and new again once you've done that and
make sure you're very very careful if
you have a colored suede protective
spray in your house you want to make
sure that you're not spraying your gray
or your tan boots with a black suede
revival spray but what I like to do to
keep my black boots looking really
intense is spray with something with a
little bit of color in so this is the
suede revive from Roesler Bromley I
bought my Stuart Weitzman boots from
Romilly and this is what they
recommended this has a little bit of
black coloring in it it's always a
little bit gray so I would recommend
doing it outside but this just helps to
read freshen up the color of my boots
can keep them a really vivid dark black
if you don't do this step if you don't
care for them and keep that color topped
up then they could go a little bit gray
a little bit dull and then is not what
you wanted from your black boots for any
slightly tougher marks if you have any
scuffs on the heels or any dirt that's
really kind of like ground in there then
you'll want a proper boot cleaning brush
or proper sweep cleaning brush again
this is one that I stole from Charlie
one of his OCD things is keeping her
sweet boobs free pristine so I just raid
his drawers this one has got kind of
like wiry brushes so this is very very
stiff and it's great for getting out any
real dirty or scratched up marks be
quite careful with this you don't want
to ruin the suede with it especially
folks where it can get quite easily
marked with this not any tough marks
it's a really really good one so I'm
going to finish off the video just with
a few notes on how I like to style over
new boots where possible I'm going to
insert pictures hopefully I will have
some examples of me starting them off
and I'll be able to link the code and
I'm also wearing with them down below
but where I don't know examples I will
just find some street style snaps to
emphasize my point so the first way that
I like to style over new boots
as I mentioned previously is with a
jumper dress for me this is just my
ultimate go-to autumn outfit it's one of
those outfits you just don't need to
think about you can just instantly wear
it and know that you look great
recently I've been wearing the black
version of my 32 pound over new boots I
wore the black version with a lighter
colored jumper dress over embossed and
you might have seen my Boston outfit
Diaries and that was just such an easy
outfit I felt great wearing it I was
really warm as well because obviously my
legs are all covered with the boots and
then I have a thermal on underneath my
jumper dress so really great for those
stuck in chair days black over new boots
of course are just so so versatile if
you're wearing something slightly
shorter a shorter dress or a shorter
skirt then of course you can wear black
tights underneath and then you can't
really tell where the boot ends and your
leg begins so incredibly leg lengthening
but how I also love to star on my black
pony
boots is the denim so whether that's
with a pair of really skin tight denim
jeans or even with a denim miniskirt I
think the denim and black boots look
really great together as I mentioned
earlier another of my favorite ways to
wear over knee boots is with skirts and
wearing over knee boots allows me to
kind of feel a little bit more confident
in slightly shorter skirts recently I've
had my new Karen Millen boots with my
Marks and Spencer dark green khaki cord
skirt and that has become a real
favorite outfit I also really love
pairing AG lay over the top of a jumper
and skirt with boots and again I did
that wearing these actually yesterday so
that's a really lovely combination and
she lays on boots they just help to add
a little bit more fun and a few more
style points to your outfit so there's a
bonus pair of boots that I wanted to
also very quickly mention they're not
technically over knee boots but because
of the color I just obviously had to
mention them these are from Russell
Bromley they're called
I think it's very high ride boots and
these I absolutely love pairing them
with a cape so you may remember the
coast Cape that I wore all the time last
year it was in my first ever proper
lookbook video looks really gorgeous
with something of this shade so these I
would call a rust color almost like a
ready Brown a really nice more intense
color if you want something a little bit
different to all the neutrals I would
recommend starting with neutrals and
then if you find that they are something
that you really are wearing a lot then
you can go a little bit more bold with
your color choices of course to many
people this is not bold there are of
course loads of bright colored boots
that are very in fashion this autumn
winter we saw on the likes of the
Balenciaga runway we saw red over knee
boots and these bold colors even
patterned boots are very much in style
this yet so you can go a little bit more
wild personally I know that it's the
more neutral ones that I'll be getting a
lot of wear out of but these ones in
particular with a cape and any camel
colored coats and outerwear look really
really beautiful last couple of styling
tips I find that if you want to look a
little bit more demure a little bit more
ladylike perhaps going to meet
boyfriend's parents or the first
or something than wearing over knee
boots with a slightly longer skirt a
longer hem line when that's a skirt or a
dress is really beautiful it's great if
you want to elongate the body as well if
you find a skirt perhaps maybe a dark
grey woolen skirts that sounds beautiful
note to self avatar which lists a dark
grey willing skirt with some great boots
like the river iron ones perhaps that
would look really really beautiful very
feminine very elegant and a style that I
will definitely be wearing more this
autumn season and then kind of similar
styling wise to the jumper dress another
of my favorite ways to wear over new
boots is with an oversized jumper now
you can wear a really big baggy jumper
with a skirt perhaps and then over new
boots and then I find that the body
fitting form of your own knee boots
really helps to contrast the bagginess
of an oversized jumper so you can really
get all snuggled up in a cozy knitwear
and then know that it really helps to
balance out with the body fitting boots
down on the bottom half is so great for
creating balance if you have got a lot
of volume and a lot of texture on the
top part of your outfit so I hope you
found that useful I hope I've given you
a little bit of inspiration on how to
wear how to style and how to care for
open ear boots I'm going to be doing a
corresponding blog post as well with
even more tips a little bit more in
depth on how to care for them and also
my wish list boots that I have got on my
list and I'm lusting for this autumn
winter and not that I need any more I'm
in a room surrounded by boots at the
moment but I just want him so versatile
and I was so so much so yeah hope you
