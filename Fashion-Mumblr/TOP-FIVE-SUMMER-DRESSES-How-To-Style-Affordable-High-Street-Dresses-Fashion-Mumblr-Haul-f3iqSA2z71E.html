is going to be my top 5 summer dresses
so over the past few weeks when it's and
loving warm I've been kind of choosing
dresses my number one wardrobe or
fashion options because I just find them
so easy to wear with a dress it's your
whole outfit sources you don't need to
worry about what top and chose to pair
together and we're really lucky that
we're not really having to wear jackets
outside the moments as a dress it's
pretty much to entire outfit the hi
students at the moment has loads of
beautiful dresses which means that I
want to see affordable so I thought I
would take the hassle out of it and
choose my top five to share with you
today so without further ado let's get
started so this is probably my favorite
and if you guys follow me on instagram
which you should go see ldm and then you
probably would have seen me try this on
in Topshop so as soon as I saw it in the
store
I was totally fell in love it's such a
classic design very elegant very
ladylike in this material is really
beautiful and lightweight I also bought
this in visa recently so and I'll leave
a link somewhere you can go check out
which looks like in action but for me
white when it comes to dresses is kind
of a fail-safe it boys is going to be a
trend this is pretty much the Primus
piece I think this was 50 pounds so it's
not never affordable but I think
considering how many times I wear this
dress because it is so timeless it's a
really good investment piece I actually
got this in a size 8 install and then it
was a little bit big so I picked up a
size 4 online and returned the 8 and
actually the size 4 fit me really really
well so that's what I've got here it
features two little buttons which do it
up at the waist and then you can really
draw in it to fit your silhouette
perfectly with this tie and the ghosts
on the back it's also got a little slit
in the back which again is just a really
lovely design detail and then the slit
goes all the way up it can can sometimes
be a little bit revealing if it's a
windy day I do have to kind of hold the
dress down because sometimes it can
reveal at your lingerie but overall I
think it's beauty elegance it does have
these little pockets as well next wise
it's really beautiful so let me show you
what it looks like on so this is the
first dress
as you can see the shape and flow of the
material is just absolutely beautiful
I really like the pocket detail to give
me this is the whole lot more casual but
can't slows I have it swings and then
you've got this bow detail at the back
and then this open section and you can
just subtly see I mentioned it can be a
little bit revealing when you're walking
it can a little bit high on the old site
area but overall I think it's just such
a beautiful classic piece very elegant
very easy to wear and what I already
warm up see those tips on so where is
the Topshop dress I feel is a really
good middle ground you can wear it for a
fairly casual day dress that it can also
be dressed up with accessories this one
my next my number two is more evening
dress so this one is probably a little
bit too detailed for daytime wear it's
again you follow me on Instagram main
Lawrence botany wearing this I wore this
to be like you know it's on a party at
these certain time and I feel that we
should go today but actually the
absolute order so it's 75 pounds again
it is High Street but a little bit more
on the pricey side for High Street is
limited edition as well and so I
wouldn't recommend hanging around if you
love this one as much as I do
I thought for the price I did actually
have a copy people asking if it was a
Midland thread which i think is great
because news and thread are normally
around 300 pounds but that got beautiful
floral embroidery it's got sheer petal
blue or almost like a very light sage
green cursive long sleeves but beautiful
very nice length for the hand but not
super short as you guys know I don't
like things to be short but this fell
around the mid thigh level fits a lot
better than it looks on hangouts it's a
lot better on the waist it is quite
quite snug fit you've got the zip
closure and because of the lightweight
material it is still nice and cool
despite the fact that you do have these
long sleeves so yeah really glad I
picked this one up I think it looked at
the beautiful on so once again let me
show you guys reflecting so this is a
pretty different color for me I don't
think I've ever worn this kind of really
safety green color but I'm trying
exposing me easy to wear as
material is lovely and lightweight it
does put in a little bit on the elbows
and then down at the bottom to create a
little bit of volume on the sleeves you
look beautiful and very detail running
all through it and boy you're on the
borders and then you've just got
beautiful ruffle detail and really
exactly notes on this dress too also a
bit of a keyhole detail back and I've
actually worn this with no bra this time
which is giving it a bit of a lack of
shape in this general area but because
you do have this sheer panel you need to
find hundreds rather quite no dipping so
check out my Wonder Bra lingerie look
clips of my gear for that I really like
how it fits in at the waist and then
they nose out just slightly it's got a
lovely amount of movement there and that
thanks to the thumbs of fabric that goes
around the way so a really beautiful
shape and yeah just a bobby pin from the
high street I think it's so detailed
it's some a really good price to the
amount of detail on this dress dress
number three and this one I have to say
was inspired by other bloggers I've seen
how many because of I've seen - so far I
can say at least three vloggers I've
seen Magnus and it's been looking at
these stunning on them so I had to pick
it up I was influenced by the influences
this is a beautiful cotton it feels like
linen but it's actually not linen and
which does mean there's going to be a
little bit more easy to care for so very
chilled out very versatile day dress for
beautiful almost like own mortal detail
buttons but overall it is really nice
relaxed vibe and quite a long length so
this is more of a Mickey boardroom of
maxi dress so great one for work if you
can get away with wearing things a bit
more casual like this in the office it's
lovely to that really easy to get on and
off as well so it's got this huge
elasticated section in the middle and
adjustable straps which means that to be
honest even if they don't have your size
you can probably go up or down they'll
still fit you very beautifully I'd say
it's really relaxed and very easy to
wear a dress
I found myself reaching for this on just
days of meetings and going out
but bunch of friends that kind of thing
and it really is an outfit all-in-one
flat sandal fuel candles it's kind of a
brainless outfit decision if that makes
sense
so let's give it a try this one that I
hope you guys will agree looks so much
better on than it does on a hanger I
think it's such a beautiful design and
just such an easy instant chic timeless
outfit that you love it so thank you to
the book is a tendency wearing it
because you've totally inspired this
purchase really love these pockets it's
very chilly outside and got the shape I
love the length it's super lady night
I've worn it was tight sandals to give
it even more of a beachy relaxed kind of
California girl style and at the same
time it is a lot of material but because
this whole neck and shoulder area is
free it doesn't feel too hot at all and
the structure of the adjustable event is
only fo for small boobs girls by me
quick it up a little bit and I love the
fact that it's tight here and it's
leather belt and I think the fact that
the waist level is here makes your legs
look longer so it's also really
reassuring yeah basic fact this one love
it so this is probably the most relaxed
of all the dresses I feel like off the
shoulder dresses like this are kind of a
staple in any summer wardrobes I wanted
to include this one it's baby pink and
white stripes you can also get it in
blue and I think that things think it
will look better in the blue but you
know I just you know no matter thinks I
had to get pink one but these are quite
frequent from France so I just feel a
little bit like Belle and from teaching
to this and I started to try this on but
I secretly kind of like that because
it's so stretchy and it doesn't have any
more areas that cling to the body it is
super comfortable also really nice for
wonderful feature braids stiffening a
beach bag and by the way if you can hear
any soft knowing noises in the
background that is my mom's dog snoring
so I apologize about that but he's
actually awake so there and how that
works it's come for really for Lulu so
yeah just a really easy to stick on
dress I think for hot days when you just
don't want to have too much fabric on
your body this is a really lovely option
so I'm going to try it on and show you
guys how to
so this is a really lovely son and going
piece went on I just feel like so
playful a merit so this is really nice
just above the me if you like things
visuals you could probably take that
quite easily it's just a simple and
simple proper stitch on a hammer we each
pick up but then the elastic along the
chest area is nice and tight so despite
the fact that like however are on and
don't feel like I'm going to be
revealing myself anytime soon pretty
pretty sturdy appear as I mentioned
sleeves are quite I feel like a
Disney Princess which I just absolutely
love and the material is primary
clinical material that is not going to
need ironing hallelujah
which for me is a great thing for taking
on summer holidays of me shoving
suitcase your each magnets don't end up
great so a nice material for that I have
paired it with some really casual beachy
espadrille shoes they are Valentino gifs
I think they were around 15 pounds so
once again I'll leave the information
for shoes in the description box exactly
like you guys are going to love these
just as much as I do
this next one that technically is
actually a jumpsuit not a dress but I do
have a fifth and final dress to share
with you this is kind of an extra one
little bit of a bonus number you could
say but I have to include it because I
think it's at the gorgeous and like a
dress it's one of these instant outfits
you can pull this out of your wardrobe
and a whole look is done what I really
love about this one in particular is the
way that it fits it just seems to have
Keaton tucked in all the right places
that fits the board it's really
beautifully the crossover on the bodice
area with the Brussels is also very
feminine and just been very simple
design details it looks really fun it's
got this cold shoulder ruffle detail
here and you've also got these straps
across the actual top of your shoulders
that doesn't go anywhere
lip closure and then it'll tie back to
so it's very very beautiful very
delicate style the material is really
lightweight so it's nice and flirty when
you wear it really cool and it comes to
just above the ankle so really
flattering legs as well so in like this
is one of those pieces that definitely
looks
ten times better arms but it doesn't
hang out so let's cut to pharmacy
absolutely not the shape of this one I
think it's such a flattering silhouette
it's been cut really really beautifully
to really come in at all the right
places
so rather than Topshop for that also
really love the amount of attention
that's been going on around the chest
area this seam ruffle is it's really
delicate but you don't feel like you've
got too much fabric on you the low cut
of the top is just about right I
wouldn't want it and lower at the same
time it's still quite fun instantly and
you can definitely read for the belt and
it would probably be even more
flattering the cinching at the waist but
I think even you can wear every night
one as well sometimes I wish I had
pockets but I can handle that because it
would add a little bit of volume to the
hip and then also lengthwise I think
it's such a nice length to make you look
a little bit taller and it really shows
off your footwear as well if you're
wearing some cute sandals and they will
be on display with this length really
beautiful lightweight summer fresh
design and really comfortable and easy
to throw on as well so basic Sam and
then here's the bonus dress this one you
probably have seen on my channel before
I have this in mind water for about four
months now I'd say this is a French
Connection number I actually picked up
on in sales I wanted to include it
because I couldn't do a top five for my
dresses without mentioning this
obviously with the heatwave that we're
currently experiencing this is a little
bit on the warm side but then if you've
got air coin in your office then you're
probably going to want a little bit more
fabric anyway this one I did actually
check just before including in this
videos there are a few left on a stalls
and a couple left on French Connection
it's actually down in Salem easels and
not in a Cell on the French Connection
web site so definitely go to a sauce and
I think of six or sold out but I'll
leave a link to it down below so you can
check your site still available if you
come down to around the 50 pound mark
down from 90 pounds I paid 90 pounds for
it but even then I'm still very very
happy with the price per where I've worn
this absolutely tons it's just such a
versatile piece I think it looks fairly
professional so it's great for wearing
and office and for me for me things the
length of it is kind of short but
because it's been modest up here you can
definitely get away with a short length
and
it's just a white beautiful silhouette
dress you've got this details please on
the neckline and these design details
let's make it little make it look a
little bit more fresh that's still a
very classic and timeless piece so I'm
sure you guys have seen it on me already
if you've been on this channel for a
little while but I will show you how it
looks on as well so as pair this one
with a pair of flats or most gladiator
style sandals to make it a little bit
more casual I'll leave a link to those
also down below they're quite nice they
should still be available I would also
pair it with me course shoes to make it
a little bit more office appropriate
they've got these beautiful
three-quarter length sleeves I think the
skin that's showing through this detail
at the bottom not sure which corner tiny
details but the skin is showing through
is really lovely defined detail very
simple silhouette and then I guess it's
kind of mid thigh length so not too
revealing I guess it just kind of
depends on the size of your office or
whatever you're doing that day is
whether it be appropriate or not but
others that I've worn astre so much I no
doubt it will continue to wear a lot as
summer months continue so those are my
top 5 summer dresses and sneaky jumpsuit

pieces with me and hopefully of giving
