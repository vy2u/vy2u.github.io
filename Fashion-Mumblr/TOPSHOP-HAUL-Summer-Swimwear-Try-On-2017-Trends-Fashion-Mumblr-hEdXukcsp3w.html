me for today's video it's going to be a
Topshop pool and you might be wondering
why things a little bit different and
it's because I am filming this on my
vlogging camera because the lighting is
a little bit strange right now so it's
quite a lot wider you can see a little
bit more of the room but I thought it
might be quite good for a whole video so
let me know what you think about this
maybe I'll do a few more videos on my
vlogging camera it is certainly one heck
of a lot easier and quicker to set up so
I feel like a lot more chilled during
the video and anyway so I have been on
top comm there was a certain shoe style
that came into stock and I had to have
them and I don't know about you but when
there's one thing in your basket that
you really want you just kind of pick
and mix and a few other pieces just to
really fill it up so that's what I did
and I've got this bag which arrived
yesterday I'm scooping I can't remember
exactly what I ordered but I'm hoping
there might be something in here that I
can wear to Wimbledon tomorrow
so without further ado let's get
straight stuck in there
Oh see dokie I feel like Topshop things
didn't need to come with a coat hanger
but I'm actually running low on coat
hangers so very grateful for that this
is an off-the-shoulder blue almost shirt
material top and I just thought it was a
very classic slimmer piece timeless
summer staples have in your wardrobe and
it's a really nice one for dressing up a
pair of white jeans that's pretty much
what I had in mind
26 pounds which i think is really good
value for the top of this detail
normally for 26 pounds you just normally
you just get something like a t-shirt
but this has definitely got a lot more
style kudos it's got the official trend
put the ruffle trend and the shell
material trend so really nailing is
three-in-one there 26 pounds I think
that's amazing
so looking forward giving this a try I
think it could be really nice four days
of meetings days and your first things
like that so let's give this when I try
to start with okay so I've popped the
top on and first impressions I really
really like it so lovely just hang the
drapes of fabric it's really nice again
I cannot believe how affordable this was
I've tucked it in to these white
trousers which you guys will see very
shortly I really like to tie detail
at the sleeves I think that's a really
nice detail and it's quite just
lightweight I like how much skin is
showing in this upper area yeah I think
this is a really great find for that
price still crying it over it and and
yeah looks really cute tucked in would
look really nice pulled out as well so
definitely a keeper okay I spoke too
soon about a coat hanger because not
everything comes with a hanger the next
thing I picked up is this pair of little
high waisted I think you would still
classify these as paper bag waist style
shorts because they do have this almost
I don't know what you'd call it but yeah
paper bag waist is the style so it looks
like you've kind of been drawn in like a
paper bag do I want to say pens but one
more time okay I just saw these are
really cute pattern I love the stripes
they feel very riviera style and I find
high-waisted shorts very flattering I
have got quite short little legs so
hopefully these are look really nice
just with a plain white cami tucked in
and a really lovely easy breezy holiday
style we have been getting some
scorching hot days here in the UK I know
that compared to most countries they're
not actually that hot but here in the UK
if the temperature hits for 30s we
literally go into meltdown and I've been
craving something like this which is a
little bit more smart and put together
but also very cool and easy breezy so
looking forward giving me to try
hopefully they look good because I can
see myself getting a lot of where else
them this is literally the most failsafe
beach outfit you could possibly imagine
that so the shorts do look really cute
and I think they are very very
flattering length and make my legs look
skinnier than that they are which I'm
very very thankful for I think they just
kind of crop off at the exact right
length and it makes my legs look like
they come up to here where it's actually
they come up to here so yeah very very
flattering
I like they've got the pocket detail in
just the right place yeah just the
perfect length they are shorts like my
crotch is literally here but they don't
look it because they are so high-waisted
I have paired it with this very simple
white tank top this is also Topshop from
a little while ago but they normally
have this kind of thing
stocke so i've and try to leave the 2017
version link down below as well and then
i put on with my favorite little river
island flat shoes these are ones I'm
wearing so much recently digital mules I
just think they're absolutely adorable
so yeah big big big tick from me and are
we wearing this little combination a lot
for upcoming hot days and some holidays
I can't go but how long they make my
legs look honestly I've got really short
little legs but this is very very
flattering these ones will come with a
hanger which is a wonderful use this is
a pair of white wide legged trousers and
I want to call this effect almost like a
weight as apron that's like split in the
middle revealing a little bit of side
legs but yeah I just thought these was a
really nice but statement top don't know
what top yet but maybe this is what I
wear through modern tomorrow if I feel
like white trousers are really good
things having your wardrobe for those
occasions where you're not sure about
the dress code because they can be
casual or they can be smart depending on
how you style them these are 49 pounds
so again pretty good value and yeah I
think this could look very very elegant
they almost could look a little bit like
a skirt because you do have a really
beautiful drape fabric but they most
definitely are trousers and hopefully
they'll be nice and snug around the hips
so let's give them a try so now I'm
showing you the trousers and really
really like this style do you guys see
what I mean about like the weight of
apron it just feels like there should be
a bow going on in the middle here but
actually they are quite revealing the
slit goes up pretty high in fact it goes
up all the way so hopefully any gusts of
wind I do like the length it's a good
idea to choose the knife software I've
paired it with my slave meals which I
love because of the length that it crops
that it is quite framing for the shoes
it's not majorly high-waisted I mean I
have come above my hips which is nice a
little bit leg-lengthening this is what
the outfit looks like as a whole and
yeah really nice straight to it when you
walk you do get a little bit of leg
showing and I think I will probably wear
this to Wimbledon and yeah hopefully I
can show you guys some clips of it in
action maybe or the thumbnail will
probably be of me wearing this at
Wimbledon so yeah you can see it
probably over Instagram as well big fan
big fan
nice one Topshop oh this is a fun one I
don't normally go for things like this
but I thought this was really cute and
also very photogenic for those holiday
answers it's a turquoise ermine costume
with a little cocktail and made out of
sequence and hopefully it's going to
have really nice like high arches of the
sides which again really flattering for
a short leg gals and then it's quite
revealing on the back if that makes
sense quite a lot of skin going through
on show which means you can still get a
really nice brown back I don't like it
when they come up really high because
you just can't get any back can and nice
v-neck should be quite flattering even
on a small busted ladies and I think
those color is just really bright and
fun and again should look really nice
this time so maybe I'll try it on but
maybe I won't but yeah let's give it a
well I ordered I was actually not
expecting to like this as much as I do
really big fan of this I think the fact
that it's so like hike us up here makes
it a lot more flattering I mean
obviously you can tell that I don't have
any boobs in it but purse effect rather
than a design flaw and yeah I just think
it's really fun color really cute design
so peachy on the boot 8a yeah quite
young for me but you know what I'm not
getting old just yet so yes I think I'll
keep it how cute so what I really like
about Topshop bikinis is that you can
mix and match so if you had a bigger
bust maybe to get a bigger top and
smaller bottoms or the other around
depending on your body type
I actually am the same size and both I
picked over 6 but I just thought it's a
really gorgeous little design it's like
a brochure on grey cream plane style
design the bottoms were 14 pounds and
the top I believe was 16 top was 18 and
the top is probably not terribly good if
you've got really big boobs but for me
this is absolute perfect just like a
bandeau top pretty much and then you've
got a beautiful again broidery detail
and a little bit of thrilled fabric yeah
kind of like frilled and details fabric
at the top there seems to get these
straps again that great tanning and they
are adjustable and
not too much fabric on the bum so you're
not going to get that big nappy bikini
bottom effect which I hate also it looks
like yeah these straps are straps so you
would be able to wear this just as a
little bando by itself which I think
could look really really cute so I'm
looking forward giving this a go so it's
very again timeless elegance and just a
really cute chic little bikini going to
show you this from afar because I've
just eaten my dinner so it's not the
most flattering time to trial and swing
costume but yeah I am a big fan of this
I really like the material I liked how
the bottoms on the top fit so yeah
definitely I mean keeping this one next
up we have the piece or pieces that
inspire this whole pool and I really
hope I'm not disappointed in these I do
actually already have the issues in pink
and yellow but I'm hoping it that I all
get just as much use out of the white so
if you follow me on Twitter you've
probably already seen these and probably
already awesome because I feel like
they're just such a gorgeous design
there are these absolutely beautiful
Chanel s sandals they are 39 pounds
which i think is incredible price to
wear these just totally smash it they go
with so many things they make jeans just
look a little bit more cute and girly
they look wonderful with some addresses
just everything they look gorgeous with
I've worn my pink on black ones so much
but I'm just thrilled to have the white
ones as well now I think 439 pounds they
are absolutely incredible
of course as with everything you guys
know the drill everything will be linked
down below in description box if you
want to shop them you can I highly
recommend not hanging around for these
because the pink one sold out very very
quickly
these are sternum stocks that I don't
know around for long especially at that
price so yeah
just trust me when I say you will not
regret this purchase and I know from so
much already I'm pretty sure that these
are we just as comfy as the pink ones
the heel height just makes them so
wearable and the black toe cap is such a
classic style these will not go out of
fashion I'll be wearing these and next
summer next spring I'm sure of it so
yeah thank you talk shops for bringing
them out and white I'm so so happy and
you'll be seen wearing these Oh up next
is a little bag and I thought it's been
a while since I treated myself to a
Topshop bag and I've never owned a bag
of this style before I think you call it
like a drawstring bucket bag obviously I
didn't want to go in with a new style
with a really expensive version so I got
this one from Topshop 22 pounds a very
affordable way of trying out a new bag
style to see if I like it so it's got
pretty long strap because probably wear
this over shoulder or crossbody and then
pretty roomy inside actually it has got
a little section in the middle for any
anything you want to keep secure it
smells like real leather but at that
price it can't be surely and then I
really like this ring detail in the
middle just gives it a little bit more
of a designer or being it's a little bit
more of a luxe feel about it and color
wise I think it's just such a gorgeous
color as well so yes very much looking
forward to styling this up and we've got
another swimsuit next or another bikini
rather this one is in a beautiful peachy
color I don't own anything this color is
up be beautiful the fabric looks like
almost a crepe paper if that makes sense
got little lines in it like crepe paper
and it's very lightweight but it's not
paper thankfully go with cute little
frills around the thigh-high area again
not too much fabric so again nice bottom
tan and then the top looks like it could
be underwire but it's not but it is
still quite a bra like shape so if you
do want a little bit more support and
it's going quite good one for that this
very girly frill it goes on the straps
as well again they're adjustable and
then it doesn't actually close like a
bra it's just a put it over the head
type job' but yeah this should look
really cute fingers crossed this style
doesn't make me look too flat chested
sometimes when they are lingerie style
it does but yeah I'll give it a go and
fingers crossed so the top actually
didn't have that much elasticity in it
so I couldn't actually get it over my
head I thought I'd just show you a
close-up it is so pretty I'm going to
order the size up as I said I got the
size 6 I'm going to order the size 8 so
that I can actually fit it on but yeah
here it is it is very very beautiful
just one to size up in and last but not
least I have this very cute very easy to
throw on
beachy day dress as you look pretty big
I ordered it in a size small I probably
could have got an extra small maybe I
didn't have one I probably would have
got an extra small they'd have had it
this is 28 pounds but it's one of those
pieces that I know that I will be very
thankful for on holidays I always pack
things like this because they're just so
easy to check on over bikini and you
wear that kind of thing so the bow much
on holidays and I didn't have anything
in blue I've got a lot of white bikini
cover-ups and but I know you guys tell
me you're wearing too much white on my
channel so I think of a blue one and
it's a nice light blue so still very
flattering and very feminine
you've got the tie detail in the middle
and then the cross over with the straps
at the back nothing about it is
adjustable it's going to be quite a
loose fit but should be a really nice
easy breezy style for over bikini here
is the little blue dress I think this is
exactly what I had in mind you just
don't feel like there's too much fabric
on your body so I'm really hot days I'm
imagining like 35 degrees you get in
places like Greece this is going to be
exactly the kind of things I crave I
really like this little cross detail on
the side here it just makes it you know
very cute to see a bikini you can see
the white some in costume top a little
bit more clearly here I've got the
straps on and but the brewery on blue
style is really really nice and yeah
just an easy piece to pack easy
lightweight material definitely one to
keep so that is everything I picked up
in my Topshop for today I really hope
you guys enjoyed looking through the
school with me and seeing the bits and
bobs done in vine recently do let me
know in the comments which is your
favorite piece and if you got to the end
then leave a little shopping bag and
Logie in the comments so that I can see
who got the end of the video and that's
different reason thank you so much for
watching and in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
