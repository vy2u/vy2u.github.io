that doesn't really need an introduction
it is a Topshop whore one of my favorite
videos to film spin a little while since
I did a Topshop haul and to be honest
this haul was made a couple of days ago
and evening when I was feeling very very
spendy and I do actually have two
ginormous bags I was going to do a mixed
high street haul but then I thought I've
got so many gorgeous pieces here that I
thought I'm going to do an entire haul
dedicated to Topshop so everything that
I mentioned in today's video as always
will be linked down below so just open
up the description box and click show
more to find all the links to everything
mentioned in this video and if you guys
haven't already then please do hit the
subscribe button as we come into spring
you're going to be seeing loads of
fashion content here on my channel
ranging from holes like this one to how
to style videos trend videos things like
that and if you are looking at to
refresh your wardrobe for spring then
check out my recent video which is eight
spring trends you can wear now hopefully
that'll give you lots of fashion in
spoke and also if you do find that you
like the kind of pieces that I'm showing
you today then be sure to be following
my Instagram which is juicy LDN because
it is over there that you'll be seeing
me styling these pieces keep an eye on
my Instagram stories are we showing you
how I wear them on a day-to-day basis so
with all of that other way let's get
started with my top shop haul so this is
bag number one absolutely gianormous I'm
just gonna pull things out in no
particular order and show you what I
bought first up is actually a pair of
shoes and these I saw on the website and
instantly fell in love with them the
color is very much my kind of color this
very muted soft powdery pink which I
absolutely adore price-wise these were
62 pounds and I think that these are
kind of shoes I'll style with perhaps
white jeans with midi dresses midi
skirts and I absolutely love this chunky
heel
I find chunky heels a lot easier to walk
in and be stable on than stilettos and I
also love when shoes have an ankle strap
as well I find that I just feel so much
more secure and more happy to wear them
for example to an evening event times
when I know I'm not just going to start
down the whole time - spring summer
weddings that kind of thing I think
these will work with a lot of my
spring/summer wardrobe we've got a bit
of an interesting design detail we're
curved on one side and open on the other
so hopefully these were really lovely
and flattering and something a little
bit different to your usual kind of core
truth style it's a big big fan of those
and very much looking forward to darling
these up in my upcoming occasion where
it looks works and things like that and
the second thing in the bag is actually
another pair of shoes these are that one
piece that instantly drew my eye and
actually are what made me do my big
Topshop order it always takes is one
thing that I absolutely adore to make me
click the Buy button instead of having
everything sitting in my basket and it
was these I can tell these the kind of
peers are going to see all over
Instagram they're gonna be a real key
trend piece this summer and I thought I
had to snap them up while they're still
available in my size at 39 pounds and I
think for upcoming beach holidays any
city breaks it's always nice to have a
really statement pair of flat shoes that
are affordable so you can walk around
and instantly just update your outfit so
these are for tour gorgeous this is a
kind of like plasticy straw effect
detail slip-on so really easy to just
pop them on really quickly and add them
to a pair of jeans if you've got
dungarees or even like a beach cover-up
I think these are going to be really
really versatile so you'll see these a
lot on my Instagram no doubt when I next
have a nice and warm holiday next up we
have a pair of pastel pink jeans if you
did watch my trend video you'll know
that this C isn't above all else pastels
are absolutely massive and while I don't
often opt for normal kind of jeans I
thought these would work with my kind of
wardrobe really really well
I think pairing these with something
like I don't know a t-shirt that's just
a little bit special this is a kind of
like a ribbed effect t-shirt from Reese
I think this is a really nice casual
outfit even with the kind of thing I'm
wearing now like this jumper here this
will look really great color wise with
any Brown II nude kind of shades as well
so if you do have a similar color
palette in your wardrobe to me I think
these could end up being a sort of piece
that will wear over and over again
throughout the spring and summer months
I also love that they do have a war hem
as you can see there it's not a finished
Pama tool so you could certainly cut
these yourself make them a little bit
more crops
I always think cropped jeans with
pointed toe shoes look absolutely
gorgeous so I'll definitely be pairing
it these two together as well I think
that pastel colored jeans is also
a really nice way of transitioning the
Wardrobe from winter to spring sometimes
it's not quite long enough to get our
legs out but by incorporating a pastel
color in our outfit it means that we're
looking towards our spring trends
keeping them nice and wearable before
the temperatures do start to warm up a
little bit also in my video about spring
trends I let you know that smarter
shorts are going to be really really big
this spring and when I saw these I
thought if I'm gonna wear that trend
it's going to be with something like
this I really really love the design of
these very high waisted and I think
that's just something quite smart about
them you've got this contrast stitching
which just it's a lovely very simple
design touch I really really like this
brown shade as well I think again this
will go with a lot of things in my
wardrobe this shade of brown works
really well with blush pink so
definitely something that should slot in
really well with the clothes that I
already have I do think that smarter
shorts could be a little bit challenging
to style so if you guys would like to
see a video perhaps on how to style
shorts then let me know that's
definitely something that I can do so
let me know in the comments if it's a
trend that you would like to see a
little bit more info on I think that I
would probably wear these at the moment
while it's a bit cooler with a really
lightweight knit a long sleeve
lightweight knit like my LK Bennett one
or perhaps with a slightly more silky
long sleeve top this one is again from
LK Bennett actually this is a really
really classic top I'm planning on doing
a piece all about the kind of basics you
need in your spring wardrobe so if
that's the video you'd like to see then
again please let me know but something
like this you'll find yourself reaching
for time and time again because it just
works with so many things and I think
that the short trend is a really good
example of that
next up something a bit different I
treated myself to some new PJ's from
Topshop I actually kind of prefer this
sateen II not real silk a lot more
affordable than real silk I find this
material so much easier to care for than
real silk I have these super luxurious
aliyev on Hull pajamas but you know what
I don't often wear them because firstly
they're two pressures and dog paws it
would make me cry if anything happened
to them but also silk just creases so
badly whereas this material which is
kind of a dupe for silk you still get
that same beautiful effect and yet it's
so much easier to care for I won't need
to iron this after every single time I
wear it so the pajama set really
affordable I think this was 30 yeah 30
pounds for the top and
shorts adjustable straps and rose gold
metal and straps - it's all about these
little details lovely lace detail on the
front here and then it also comes with
this adorable little pair of shorts
which are just super super cute but
let's be honest it is absolutely the
color that made me want to treat myself
to these I am long overdue a pajama
clear out so I'm very much looking
forward to doing that and adding these
to my night to our collection I don't
usually mention underwear on halls but
why not I also picked up this lovely set
from Topshop I think that the color
again is really really beautiful and
it's nice to just refresh your lingerie
collection every now and then I thought
the brand particular was really sweet
with the lace overlay and then I always
like to have a little matching set so
pick those up as well so I actually
picked up these for my spring basics
video which I mentioned that I'm
currently planning I wanted to try them
out they look really big I ordered my
usual size which is the size 3 I have
mini mini feet but these do look pretty
big so I'll let you know whether they
fit true to size I really want these to
be amazing because they're 39 pounds and
I think that a pair of nude shoes in
your wardrobe should be an absolute
staple currently I always reach my
Valentino rock studs which obviously
have a very premium price tag to them so
439 pounds I thought these were
absolutely beautiful once again you've
got this detail where a little bit of
the side of your foot is exposed here
whereas it's full on this side and these
if you told someone that they were John
Frieda Rossi or even Jimmy Choo I think
you could definitely get away with it
they look absolutely beautiful
I think Topshop is always a really great
one for shoes that look far more premium
than their price tag so praying that
these fits because I think they could be
a real basic piece for your spring
wardrobe actually all year round it's
always good to have a nice pair of nude
shoes in your wardrobe so high hopes for
these we have another PJ set next and
this is a pink and white striped set
it's kind of got Victoria's Secret vibes
about it also it comes with a little
pair of shorts with an elasticated waist
band and then this is just a very simple
kind of a shirt style top very relaxed
sometimes you just feel like you want
long sleeves you want something a bit
more cottony and cozy but as we go in to
the warmer months it is nice to have
shorts on the bottom instead of long
legged trouser PJ's so as I said gonna
have a PJ key route and it's nice
a couple of new sets this next one is a
little bit experimental they looked
amazing on the model on the website so
I'm really looking forward to styling
these up you'll be able to see on the
screen now how they look on me but
hopefully they fit really nicely because
again I think these could be a lovely
alternative to jeans for the warmer
months if like me you just don't love
jeans and you sometimes struggle to find
things that are different to wear on
your legs then this could be a really
lovely option again I think pointed toe
shoes would look really lovely with a
star like this or if you've got any
pointed toe boots such as these lovely
ones from Jun that could be a really
nice way of styling it and again getting
some pesto into your outfit ahead
Offspring okay my darlings next up we
have another pair of shoes and these I
thought just looked so much more
high-end than Topshop I think they have
a real designer vibe about them almost
kind of like a whistles Phoebe feel Oh
kind of almost Cellini vibe I just
thought they looked very very designer
but the price tag is in fact 56 pounds
love this heel I think the height is
amazing if you are petite then you'll
know how much just a little high boost
means that they are still a very chunky
solid heel so hopefully very easy to
walk in personally I don't mind
flip-flops I don't mind having a kind of
toe separator I know some people find it
really uncomfortable but I don't mind it
I actually quite like it so hopefully
these will be nice and comfortable this
material is quite spongy so again hoping
that that means are going to be really
nice and comfortable and they're the
type of thing that if you are wearing
cropped jeans or just instantly make
your whole look seem a lot more
fashionable so these are a piece you'll
probably be seeing me wearing a lot on
my more casual days cheering in the
spring and summer months now these have
got a very similar vibe to them to the
shorts that I showed you earlier but
these are in fact a very full length
trouser they're very long indeed but
nice and high-waisted so they should be
very flattering and very leg lengthening
in fact the kind of crotch to waist
ratio is absolutely ginormous I think
they're going to probably come up to
just below my boobs by the looks of it
yeah pretty much but they should make me
look like my legs are a million miles
long so if they can do that then I'll be
very very grateful nice big pockets as
well so really nice for a very casual
vibe I think with a white t-shirt the
shoes I showed you a second ago these
would look amazing also
with pointed toe boots sandals heels I
just think they're going to be very very
versatile and once again a really nice
alternative to jeans I've gone for the
UK for and they do look to be honest
they look like a UK six or an eight so
hopefully they're not gonna be to clown
trousers alike but you'll be able to see
how I've starved them and how they fit
on the screen now they do look like
they've been tailored very well you've
got some darts in the back and in the
front here so fingers crossed to fit on
these is really lovely okay I'm moving
on now to the second bag from Topshop
and this one has a lot of accessories in
there starting with this bag as soon as
I spotted it on the website
instantly adds it to my basket it's
adorable it's 22 pounds very very
affordable but once again it looks
really really high-end this has got a
very designer v to it an instant way to
update your outfit if you've got even if
you're not investing in trends for
spring just spending 22 pounds on
something like this will instantly add a
spring trend to your wardrobe it does
have a strap wearing over the shoulder
or you could just hold it by these cute
little top handles I obviously love the
gold metal with this blush pink shade so
definitely be getting a lot of use out
of this then another very affordable
handbag this one is 32 pounds again I
just fell absolutely in love with the
color this one material wise is more of
a faux suede I thought it had definite
Fendi vibes to it with this detailing
this stud effect around the outside the
front flap with this ring on it I think
it's kind of magnetic the way that it
catches once again you've got a long
strap so you can wear it across the body
or you can just shorten it and hold it
by this top strap here I think if you
are not as into pastels you don't want
to dress head-to-toe pastels than just
spending a smaller amounts of money and
investing in a pastel accessory like
this will give you a whole outfit and
nod to that spring trend without going
whole hog and Topshop their bags this
season are just fabulous so very very
pleased with this one as well
I always think Topshop have really
fabulous affordable sunglasses so I
actually picked up three pairs in this
haul they always come with a little kind
of faux leather pouch as well starting
with this pair not sure if you can see
but they do have a gold bar running
through the top they're just a really
nice design detail very flattering for
my kind of face shape I love this style
where they have a slight cat flick to
them I think it works
really nicely with my face shape and
these really really lightweight they
don't have the little nose and nozzles
inside so you can put them up on your
head and not have to worry about them
ruining your hairstyle which is a huge
bonus and in general the design of these
is just kind of like a tour toy shell
effect which I again absolutely love and
might even take these skiing with me
when you guys are watching this video I
will be in a foster farm in Austria
skiing so yeah I think these could be
really nice ski sunglass as well before
wearing them into the spring these ones
are a little bit different for me but I
really like mirrored sunglasses I think
they had a totally different look to
your outfit I always think it's really
funny when you talk to people and you're
wearing weird glasses because people
don't really know whether to talk to you
or look at the reflection people are
kind of like checking their hair and
your sunglasses it's really really funny
that definitely keeps me entertained I
thought these are really cool a very
different style different kind of vibe
to the usual sunglasses they're kind of
aviator style you can see yourself in
the camera lens up there once again this
kind of sunglass which is all mirrored
is definitely a trend that we're going
to be seeing sunglasses wise for spring
but I don't really love to invest
hundreds of pounds in my sunglasses I
lose them or I break them I sit on them
so these are food ones from Topshop are
absolutely perfect we have another
handbag next and I don't own anything in
my wardrobe which is this kind of sorbet
green color but I thought it was a
really beautiful shade another one for
the pastel trend we've seen so much this
season this one is actually from Topshop
luxury design so it is 75 pounds not
sure how I feel about it now is about so
it was an affordable bag but actually
it's really not 75 pounds I think you
can probably get a lot more for your
money so I think this is gonna go back
don't think I realized how much it was
when I ordered it but it is very cute
and if you do want to spend some five
pounds on a pastel bag it is a lovely
option but don't think that one's for me
next is another underwear set and this
is pretty much the same as the one
before but it is in this creamy color
once again I just really really like the
lace and it does have matching knickers
as well previously I got a little fawn
but these are more of a Brazilian style
so I thought that I would add those to
my collection and then I keep seeing
this top everywhere and decided I had to
give it a try it is this one here very
plain white top another basic piece for
your spring
I think it's 20 26 pounds so a very
affordable piece really love these
almost kind of turtle effect buttons in
the middle here this I think would be a
really really lovely holiday piece with
denim shorts it's definitely got that
kind of Free People vibe to it very
bohemian so China I think you might
going to Mexico in April and I thought
this would be a really nice one to stash
until then okay guys so I totally forgot
to mention these in the talking part of
the haul but I thought I would include
them in the try on these lovely kind of
velvety trousers are also from Topshop I
would definitely recommend sizing up I
think these are actually a little bit
too tight for me but perfect for kind of
lounging around the house if you work
from home I think they're perfect for
that kind of thing and really affordable
just kind of a nice alternative to
tracky bottoms something a little bit
smarter to chap something a little bit
smarter to chill around the house in so
yeah really big fan of these velvety
striped trousers and they finish you
can't really see but they finish just
above the ankle also from Topshop so I
mentioned earlier that I don't have much
denim and my wardrobe but I do think it
is a kind of cool piece to have in your
wardrobe and everybody raves about
Topshop Jamie jeans once you know your
size you can kind of just beeline for
them and know they'll fit you up see
perfectly
these are wonderfully high-waisted and
then they are slightly cropped at the
bottom I think I'm actually going to
trim there so they are raw hemmed at the
bottom you could even create your own
dip hem that's still really fashionable
I think these will look really great
with my Gucci mules and also the pointed
toad knotted shoes that I showed you
earlier
Topshop Jamie jeans are just super super
comfortable as you can see they've got
quite a lot of stretch to them and this
colorway I think is just really classic
so again a really good basic piece for
my spring wardrobe we have two straw
bags next I'm definitely not going to
keep both and so definitely let me know
in the comment section which one is your
favorite but straw bags and circle bags
are absolutely huge this spring so I had
to check out the Topshop options this
one is a lot more structured it's got
kind of like a wire structure to it so
it's definitely going to be very much
staying in this shape I really like the
leather strap on this one I think it
gives it almost like a picnic hamper
vibe to it and then you've got this
lovely floral design on the front 26
pounds
so a very affordable way of wearing at
the straw bag trend this one I think
it's just absolutely adorable this one
is 22 pounds it's got the little crabs
on the front I think if you've got a
beach holiday coming up then this is
just adorable for keeping your beach
essentials even just here in the UK if
you're a fan of crabs or if you just
want to take part in the straw bag trend
then this is a really fun option almost
definitely be keeping this 122 pounds I
think is absolutely amazing and a great
way to just add a bit of fun to your
beach look the second last thing in this
haul is another bag I did go a little
bit crazy on the old bag certainly won't
be keeping all of them so please do let
me know which ones you like and which
ones you think I should return it down
in the comments this one is just a very
very classic style a lovely evening bag
price-wise 29 pounds which is fantastic
considering the amount of detail and
embellishment you've got on this one you
can see this lovely kind of crystal
effect on the front again it has very
much a designer vibe with this push lock
in the middle looks very much kind of
further or even some Gucci style and
then inside you have this long chain
strap so you can wear this crossbody
really lovely if you do have any special
events coming up anything at I've got to
the races weddings that kind of thing
a lovely very classic bag not going out
of style any time soon so a great one to
add to your occasion wear wardrobe I
also could not resist picking up this
bag I've seen ever on my Instagram and I
absolutely love it
as I said circle back trend absolutely
huge and this one is super affordable
fits a lot of stuff in there and it's
such a striking addition to your
wardrobe the downside is that so many
people have it but I think for good
reason I love the studs I love that it
has a kind of Chloe pixie vibe without
being a total ripoff
and for 28 pounds this I think is the
best circle bag I've seen on the high
street
it's truly beautiful so Topshop well
done prepare to see this also all over
my Instagram and last but not least just
as the clouds start to come the
Lighting's probably gone a little bit
gray I have got this lovely floral robe
from Topshop at this time of year I like
to switch out my really chunky almost
woolen cozy dressing-gown for something
a little bit lighter and this kind of
thing is absolutely perfect it's a
cotton material so much much lighter if
you do live in a warmer place than here
in the UK
this is a really nice thing to have just
on the back of your bedroom door so
you're not darting around the house in
your PJs and this is the kind of thing
also I will take on holidays with me so
for let's see 29 pounds I thought that
was a really lucky one for again my
night recollection okay my darlings that
is absolutely everything that I picked
up from Topshop lately I really hope you
