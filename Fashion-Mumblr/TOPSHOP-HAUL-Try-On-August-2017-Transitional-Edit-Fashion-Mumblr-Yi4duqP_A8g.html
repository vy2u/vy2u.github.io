this for me is such a relief to be
filming cuz it is the final hole that
I'm filming for fresh remember the whole
week you guys have actually got another
one coming your way tomorrow evening but
I already filmed that once it's all out
the way I'm filming this on the morning
it's going live and I'm so excited for
the long weekend so I really hope you
guys are as well hope you got some fun
stuff planned
and so yeah today's haul is going to be
a Topshop haul and I originally planned
on filming us a few days ago but
actually my order did not arrive on time
I forgot to click Express Delivery but
it's finally arrived so we are finally
ready to film the first thing that I
want to talk about is this dress that
I'm wearing now and I realized that may
be quite a few of you will have tuned in
and decided that your app so you hated
this dress I thought the exact same
thing too when I first pulled out the
bag and tried it on but it is definitely
growing on me already I really like the
length of it I'm not sure if you can
kind of see in the reflection on certain
overlay but it's quite short and if you
faked and your legs and you got some
cute little boots then I think it looks
really lovely I have decided to keep the
suede Chloe Susannah boots which I think
peso so nicely with this dress it's got
quite festival vibes about it but also I
think could be really good for going
into autumn when you're just not quite
ready to put your legs away I ordered
this dress in a size 4 and also a size 6
so I have a couple here this is a size 4
that I'm wearing now and it is fairly
tight so there's not too much movement
on these arm areas in particular but I
think the size 6 is just a little bit
too big for me on the shoulders so with
this one I'd say if you're between sizes
then it's definitely best to choose one
size down one thing that did arrive a
few days ago in a previous haul that you
may have already seen on my Instagram is
this pair of clots so I also ordered
this in a size 4 and a size 6 this is a
size 6 which I'm going to return it
because the size 4 is what fit me
absolutely perfectly and insert a little
clip of me wearing them while on our
trip to Italy just here I wore them so
often while we're away we just got back
yesterday and I absolutely adore them
that the color is beautiful for autumn
season and really like the fact they've
got these pockets and they've got pleats
as well it just makes it fit really
beautifully around the waist and then
it's got a beautiful hang to them as
well so this is a piece
I'm already wearing and I can definitely
foresee myself wearing a lot in the
autumn as well maybe with boots but at
the moment I've just been wearing them
with sandals and then this is very much
an autumn piece I saw this on the
website and couldn't resist it is a faux
fur juillet a few of the garments that
I've spoken about in recent halls I've
said they look really great with the G
lay over the top so I decided to pick up
this one I thought because it's just so
neutral so plain it would look great
over any pattern pieces like this for
example this I did pick up in a size 4
and it looks quite oversized so I'm
really glad that I went down a size for
this one it's gonna be so warm a really
great way to add a comforting a thermal
layer to autumn outfits this is another
piece that I picked up on one of those
really cold gray rainy days so it's
actually hot and sunny so it's making me
feel a little bit hot and sweaty looking
at this but I really like Topshop coats
I think they're so classic and really
good value for money this one was 65
pounds which i think is absolutely super
I'm a big fan of double-breasted coats
as well I think they look really
luxurious and this one's got almost like
a royal stamp on the buttons which gives
it a really nice touch love the faux fur
love the camel color love the length and
I really really like the price tag I do
often go for more expensive coats but
it's nice to have one for more as a life
everyday kind of runaround coat in your
wardrobe so for me that is what this
will be this one however is a little bit
smarter I absolutely love the color of
this and I'm a big fan of duster coats
especially when it's a little bit too
warm outside for a sick boy coat but a
little bit too cool just to go out in
your t-shirt and jeans so that's when I
really love duster coats I had one from
River Island last year and I'm keeping a
lookout for the same person again this
year but this one is a lot darker than
that one it's more of a dusky pink 69
pounds I think it's fantastic price and
I really like this got a waist belt as
well can give it a really nice casual
chilled out vibe I probably wouldn't do
it up with the buttons because they are
in the center instead of on the side
which I think might make it look a
little bit doctor-like but yeah this
color is just absolutely beautiful and I
can see myself getting a lot of wear out
of this in autumn the next thing that
I've picked up is this pair of paper bag
waist style black trousers I've been
trying to pick up some pieces that are
more appropriate for like work wear
wardrobe I actually get quite a lot
you guys about work we're and it's quite
tricky for me cuz I don't normally go
into an office any more if I do go for
meetings I could rock up in something
like this and it'll be absolutely fine
but I am trying to experiment with a few
more work wear stuff so that I can
potentially put maybe a notebook
together for you so that's what I picked
these up for again a really good price
lovely material it's obviously not the
most luxurious of materials but the
high-street it feels really nice and
it's not going to crease which is really
important for if you're sitting around
their desk it's got pockets
it's got darts there should be nicely
shaped so I'll give this a try and show
you guys how it looks I've definitely
been on the lookout for or tunnel
dresses recently I'm really in the mood
to be wearing dresses and boots at the
moment probably so that I can start
getting some use after my new Chloe's
but I picked up this dress as well I
realized this is total floral overload
right now but this one is a lot lighter
material this one is more of a thick
cotton whereas this is almost a very
very sheer almost see-through kind of
silky material it's got more ruffles on
it whereas this is more stiff and you've
even got ruffles and like fluted details
on the hands to twitch I think is really
pretty effect this one I think will also
look really nice with a nice waist belt
and it was 46 pounds so a really nice
affordable transition piece before this
time of year I must also not forget to
mention this one you guys have been
asking me about it in the background of
my videos recently this was from a
Topshop order a little while ago I've
still not worn it but yeah I just
thought I'd mentioned this it's another
floral dress really good for that 70s
boho trend love all the frills on this
and this would be really good for any
late summer special occasions any
weddings christenings that kind of thing
I think this would be absolutely perfect
a couple of bags to quickly mention this
one you may have spotted in my autumn
trends video I'll leave it linked up on
the screen here but it is a red bag
which if you watch the video you'll know
that red is one of the main colors of
the season and if you don't want to wear
head to toe red they're bringing a red
accessory into your look is a really
good way of just taking part in that
trend without spending an absolute
fortune I also think because of the ring
detail in this it gives it a really
luxurious and high and feel but without
that high-end price tag so big fan of
this love this crossbody as well it's
just a really fun way an affordable way
of adding a pop of red to your outfit
and then this one I just absolutely
thought it was so cute I love cross
shoulder bags and I really wanted to try
out this kind of faux fur trend but
without going again full force it's more
like a shilling sheepskin style but
really really like this one you can have
the handle here which is where I've set
it or you can pull it all the way up to
be a crossbody bag to really like the
gold detail and it's a good size for me
as well if it's an iPhone 7 plus
vlogging camera lipstick purse etcetera
so both of these really good size and
very very versatile so this is a piece
that I picked up and with it in mind to
style with some of the smaller trousers
in this haul for like a work wear style
it is an almost balloon sleeve you'll
see in the cutaway that the sleeves are
quite inflated quite poofy which is
really good for that balloon sleeve
trend that we're seeing but in my
opinion slightly more wearable love the
color of this 128 pounds which is really
good again I picked up the size 4 and it
looks to be a really good fit for me so
I think sizing down for this one again
would be a really good option but yeah a
really nice layering piece for autumn
very practical and a really beautiful
basic for the upcoming season and
speaking of work wear this is another
pair of smart trousers that I picked up
I thought these looked like a really
lovely shape they are culottes which in
my opinion is a little bit more stylish
than the old cigarette style which I
think can look a little bit outdated
sometimes I think lots just are a little
bit more chic so I got them in this gray
very smart kind of suit light material
and then they've got this big thick
waistband at the top which again is a
really nice design detail just to make
it work outfit look a little bit more
smart so I'll try pairing these with the
cream top and you can see how that looks
together 42 pounds so together a very
affordable and chic work outfit so in
this Topshop order I also picked up a
scarf I absolutely love this color and I
just find it so good for completing
outfits very flattering on the skin tone
as well the way that reflects the light
up onto your face I find that super
flattering absolutely love this color
this blush shade or millennial pink I
guess it's called it's just the basis of
my wardrobe so I thought it'd be really
nice to get some accessories just to add
that pop of color in encase my outfit
just happens to not contain pink this
one was 16 pounds really love the in
soft and light it is
Harry as well it's got quite a lot of
like media fluff on there which
hopefully means it'll be a really cozy
piece when it does start to get a lot
cooler outside this is another lovely
layering piece for when the temperatures
do start to drop again in the lush pink
everyone needs a cozy cardigan that kind
of thing that when you get home after
work and you put your comfy clothes on
you just want something really snuggly
to wrap around your shoulders so for me
it's exactly this 39 pounds it's like a
kind of pink kamal if that makes sense
it's not gray mile because pink but is
definitely very speckle t it has got
these big reinforced pockets just a
really super cozy slouchy piece it's
something that I know I'll get so much
use out of and just really comfy and
cozy it's so very pleased with that one
and we are not done yet
I actually have another big order here
that I'm yet to open up so just to be
totally transparent I actually have been
working with Topshop over the past few
months actually on my blog and here on
my youtube channel and they very kindly
sent me a voucher so everything that is
in this bag has been paid for with that
voucher so thank you very much to
Topshop
I will show you guys what I picked up
and none of that okay so this is
obviously still got some of the wrapping
on but I decided to pick up this giant
hairy maxi bag again if you saw my
autumn winter 17 trends video then
you'll know that I spoke about maxi bags
and I included this one on the screen as
the one that was on my wish list well I
decided to pick it up I think this size
bag for me I'll get so much use out of
especially now that I'm using the YSL
sunset bag as my everyday I do love to
carry a little bit more around with me
as it gets cooler I like to carry maybe
a scarf or a bigger cardigan and my
laptop my memory cards my camera so
having a big bag like this it was almost
my secondary bag I think will be very
very practical it was 35 pounds and oh
and also if I take the dogs with me into
work which I often do for meetings this
will be so handy not only for them to
snuggle up tubes it's so soft i'll
definitely like think it's that bad but
i can keep all the dog stuff in there as
well poo bags bottles water balls things
like that so big bag is very handy and i
thought this one was really really cute
and because it's so textured and so big
it takes off two of autumns key trends i
picked up another
faux fur pink coat I don't know if you
guys remember my a sauce haul again I'll
leave that linked up here but I
mentioned a pinky lilac faux fur coat
well I actually decided to send that one
back and get this one in its place
because I decided that the slightly
silvery gray lilac tone didn't really
suit me and I'm just a pink girl after
all of that so I decided to get a more
of a pink one this Topshop one is the
exact perfect shade the sleeves are a
little bit more cropped as is the body
which I find a little bit more
flattering I got this from Topshop
petite and it was 79 pounds it's got
almost like a bit of a hood it's more of
a really high neck so you can get very
snogged up with this really lovely and
more and cozy and once again found that
faux fur is a key autumn trend so while
previously maybe last year I would have
thought this is a little bit too girly
this year because it's so on trend I'm
very much looking forward to wearing it
I picked up some jewellery from Topshop
as well I thought these looked very
Monica vinegar ish but actually it was
only I think 16 pounds for 3 pairs of
earrings are sure you were close up of
these now I've been looking for some
more affordable earrings because I
really don't change my debris around
that much I have some investment pieces
that I wear all the time but I thought
if I do want to change it up
these still look really lovely in
high-end but without that price tag come
a little bit closer to show you these
these are a little bit less classic more
like a trend piece because they are of
course this tassel design I'm yet to try
out the tassel earrings friend I'm
always very phobic that they might be a
bit heavy in my ear but I looked at the
materials of these and they didn't sound
too heavy and they don't feel too heavy
at all and I thought this kind of plummy
burgundy color would work and really
well with loads of my new pieces for my
autumn wardrobe and then you've got this
gold disc as well which just makes them
look a little bit more kind of classic
and luxe as well so very pleased with my
earring purchase if you guys follow me
on Instagram and regularly check out my
Instagram stories you may recognize this
piece because I featured it a couple of
weeks ago as one of the things on my
autumn wishlist I decided that I needed
it in my life so I picked this jumper up
34 pounds again beautiful millennial
soft pink I just think it's such a
beautiful shade and I really like the
neckline detail on it I will definitely
be able to wear thermals underneath
it and you guys have also been asking me
about my thermals I get them from Marks
and Spencers because they're so warm
they're so thin and undetectable from
underneath your clothes so highly
recommend those I will if they're
available yet leave some link down below
but I will talk about them so much in
winter but yeah it'll definitely not be
able to see your thermals from under
this cuz the high neck really love that
it's not a balloon sleeve it's just more
of a billowy sleeves very loose-fitting
and then it goes down to quite a tight
cuff at the bottom so still very put
together polished and quite an ad like
how it's so slimmed down at the bottom
so yeah I think this would be a really
nice way of looking a bit smarter when
working from home but also I can
definitely wear out for me things as
well with a nice gold necklace I think
this will be absolutely beautiful and
last but not least and probably one of
the pieces I'm most excited about I
picked up a pair of boots from Topshop
and oh I think I've got the wrong size
they look huge no 36 I don't know maybe
it's a style but because I sent back the
black Cloe boots I decided I did need a
pair of classic black boots in my autumn
wardrobe and this ring detail I just
think makes them look so high-end so I
picked these up from Topshop love that
they're kind of Payton love the shape of
this heel I don't know if you can see
but it's kind of wider at the bottom
than it is at the top which I think
gives it a kind of 70s 5 again 70s being
honest autumn ski trends so I thought
these are really really lovely weather
with shorts or with jeans or cropped
jeans I think these look great and yeah
everyone needs a pair of classic peg
boots in their winter wardrobe so these
are the ones that I've gone for this
year ok so that is everything that I
have bought from Topshop kaam recently I
really hope you guys enjoyed looking
through all these pieces with me if you
