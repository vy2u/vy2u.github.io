joining me for my Topshop Hall as part
of the fashion number some are holy
every single day this week I'm
publishing a whole video I buy quite a
lot at the beginning of each season
because it's a great time to just inject
from summer into your wardrobe so of
course I had to include a Topshop call
because Topshop is pretty much my
favorite brand pepper and they've got
some really beautiful pieces in at the
moment so without further ado I'm going
to let you know what what I bought I'm
going to start with this pair of sandals
because I think they are so adorable
they're staged and yet they've got this
rainbow of pom-poms across the flip-flop
taupe song area I find it so funny the
Australians called flip-flops songs
yeah really tickles me but these just
look so adorable with a little pom-poms
and then they're very secure they've got
these straps I think even we've seen
these not only on me but on a lot of
bloggers a lot of your friends I think
they're definitely going to be a hit
this month there are only 22 pounds as
well which is just incredible value and
yeah can't wait to wear these and IV fur
in any other upcoming beach holidays but
also in the UK just a little bit of fun
to the summer wardrobe
another accessory I picked up this bag I
think it's such a handy size you can
wear across the body thanks to this flat
yellow gold strap this was 25 pounds
trimming Topshop may have reduced that
prices I don't know everything that
seems to be really great value at the
moment I love this pearl detail across
them this makes it go really well with
my steal lights and shoes and then my
Shyam dupes which also have this gold
bordered pearl detail it's a really
interesting class do you actually kind
of bend it down to ping it open and then
it's big enough to fit my makeup my
phone including iPhone 7 plus and also
my vlogging camera so just a really
practical size really like the color
it's past also the great spring trend as
well though because this is lilac II
passed all I think it could be really
nice for autumn as well so hopefully
going to getting a lot of wear out of
this in the coming weeks and months the
first actual clothing pieces I picked up
is this beautiful top I think that top
is just such as
equality the material I'm guessing it's
going to be quite a thick polyester
let's have a look
95% polyester 5% and a stain but it's
really sick material I remember I bought
with top in this material last summer
and I wore it so so so much this is of
the shoulder it's got ruffle around the
neckline so really ticking a lot of
trends there because it has got the
shoulder strap so you don't have to
worry about it slipping down whereas
it's styled like this I'm constantly
pulling them up and this one was around
the 30 panel mark from Topshop I picked
up the size six and I just love styling
this for things like denim trousers cut
off clots skirts such a versatile piece
so you're definitely wearing this a lot
over the summer so this is another
really beautiful white top from Topshop
this one I still have a label on it was
29 pounds again I got the size 6
this is more of a holiday style top it's
got this beautiful and what's the word
lace I guess you call it lace trim you
can't see very well but it does have
sleeve so you've got the smoking
stretchy detail at the top of your
shoulders and then at these slightly
billowing sleeves really lovely just
lightweight material great to some
holidays but because it does have the
sleeves I think it would be lovely for
UK summer wear as well I really love the
trend of ties on the shoulders I think
it has a really chilled out by really
kind of carefree very hippy kind of boho
style really love you for festivals and
I just think white tops like this are
such a summer staple this is probably
the piece I am most excited about in
this haul and I'm so excited to wear it
it's actually a jumpsuit or uncertified
bit on the model on the website here so
you can see what I mean but it's just
absolutely gorgeous so the top is this
really lightweight smoky lacy detail
that just hangs over the bodies in a
really feminine chilled out festival
beachy vibe and then at the bottom of
the jumpsuit is legs you've also got
this lacy detail you can see it's got
kind of like holes in the fabric this
cutout detail that just you know it
looks really effective on its own you
can see a little bit of skin a little
bit of silhouette behind you and then
you've got this pull in and application
waist so very very soft drink
I'm on the lookout at the moment for a
brown rope style belt I think this'll
really finishes off beautifully with a
lovely delicate necklace as well
I can imagine wearing this on the beach
with those metallic transfer tattoos I
think it's going to look so so gorgeous
and once again a really loving material
does create easily but I actually don't
think it looks bad creased so most
definitely one that's going to be coming
in my suitcase before my upcoming trips
so I was determined to find a pair of
sliders that I could wear on my son
holidays and I'm not too sure if these
are the ones but I got these from
Topshop there were 29 pounds they're
very affordable and they're definitely
very fun we can say that for sure
they've got giant faux gemstones over
the top they've got pom-poms
they've got frills they've got lace they
literally have got everything it's like
a children's craft project vomited all
of these sliders and so they're very fun
I'm sure they are incredibly comfortable
I have some shoes from jill's that are
sliders but a lot more plain symbols and
these and I'm one of those in LA they
are so comfortable I thought why not get
a more jazzy path still haven't made my
mind up on these give me a yes or a No
or a yay or a nay in the comments so
yeah
Topshop sliders next I have a swimming
costume and I absolutely adore this I
just think the color blocking is so chic
I can imagine like a Colosseum in a hair
with a heron little Bowl and wearing
this on the beach and yes they think
it's so gorgeous I love this shade of
pink the white band and then the black
contrast is just so stylish so pointless
and then you've got this double strap
detail which crosses over at the back hi
cutout for the legs so nice and leg
lengthening and a fairly small amount of
fabric on the bottom so it should be
quite flattering on the old boot a I've
said many times before
I think swimming costumes of the poster
bikinis are a little bit more stylish I
feel a lot more confident in them and
this one it was only I think that I was
fair to cover mark 26 pounds so a really
lovely one for not that much money and I
think this is a kind of one that I reach
for when I go to Mum Spa she's a star
and she remembers Farney where she lived
and so
and when I go to the spa for swim I
don't really like my rapini
that you're revealing but this is going
to be athlete's perfect so you may be
surprised to hear that my next searching
from Topshop was a bikini but this one
was so cute those can resist and I
thought I would make an exception to my
own swimming costume only ruling so this
one is actually under wired so I guess
if you are lucky enough to have larger
boobs than I do and this could be a
really great style for you lots of
support and then you've got there's a
lace detail underneath which for me is
great because I have actually got like a
birthmark underneath my business in the
middle which one bit conscious of this
will cover that I'm hoping that I
actually fill this out but it does look
like I could put a little bit having in
there if I wanted to plain white bikini
use just always make you look so tanned
and I really like the lace detail on
this one same lace detail runs across
the sides of the bottoms again not too
much fabric so it should be fashioned on
a bum 16 pounds for the bottoms and 20
pounds for the top so 36 pounds for the
duo and I just think this is really
lovely stylish bikini hopefully very tan
in handsome most but not least and this
is fairly similar in Styles when I'm
wearing now with it being off the
shoulder but this is a very cute
definitely a beach Chucky's on of your
bikini shove it in a wall at the bottom
your beach bags that kind of vibe top in
this rather unusual CG green person and
then cream material it's a very
lightweight cotton definitely a great
one if you're going to any researching
countries and either Greek islands and
if it is lessons ballet area probably
not right the Balearic Islands then this
would be a really lovely one so it's
almost like a t-shirt style very chilled
out very kind of faithful brand up those
kind of vibes this is the kind of thing
that you will show in your suitcase kind
of almond are about it and then wear
tons on holidays it's just so easy to
wear definitely what I have in mind when
I picked it out from the website so yes
another lovely affordable investment
this was only 26 pounds so on skin I
feel value from Topshop they will no
doubt be more Topshop somehow finding
its way inside wardrobe over the next
