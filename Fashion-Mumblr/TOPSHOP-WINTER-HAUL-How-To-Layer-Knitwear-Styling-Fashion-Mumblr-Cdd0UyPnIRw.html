me for another haul here on my youtube
channel so today I wanted to do
something slightly different because I
know that there are and especially on my
channel so many hauls and I wanted to
offer something a little bit more useful
as well as just a bit of an edit of what
I have been buying lately so for today's
haul not only am I going to be sharing
with you a few bits that I have picked
up recently from Topshop from their
autumn winter collection that for me are
real staples for my autumn winter colder
months wardrobe but as I go through
those pieces I'm also going to be
sharing with you some tips on layering
obviously during the colder months it's
really crucial that we layer up those
pieces to maximize warmth and maximize
that cozy factor so I'm going to be
sharing some tips on how to layer and
how to make sure your outfit looks
really fashionable and cozy throughout
these colder months so I really hope you
find this useful as well as interesting
and if you do fancy shopping any other
pieces that I'm sharing with you they
are all bought from the past two weeks
or so from Topshop including a few
pieces of it in the Black Friday sales
still then they will all be linked down
in the description box so just click
show more everything that I mentioned in
this video will be linked down below so
I'm gonna get straight started with the
jumper that I'm wearing now I've been
wearing this so much lately since I
picked this one up a couple of weeks ago
it's from these slightly more premium
end of the Topshop offering it was
around the 75 pound mark but I feel like
that really shows the design detail on
this I absolutely love it just seems to
be a really great fit it's perfectly
baggy but without being unflattering and
there's just something very simple but
something very chic about this almost
sash detail that runs across the front
it's just where the stitching has been
done in like an over stitched fashion
but the effect that it has I hope that
you will agree I think is just really
really nice very chic and a perfect
layering piece of course underneath this
you could wear something fairly thick I
personally just like to have fairly
plain thermal top you guys know I love
my thermals underneath it and I wore
this out today was about 1 degree when I
left the house this morning and because
this is a mixture of acrylic wool and
mohair it really helped to keep the
warmth in teaming that with the thermal
the perfect way to layer up on it just
to make sure you keep extra snuggly warm
I find this to be a really flattering
length as well I'll insert an overlay
clip so that you can see how long it is
here as well
personally I really
to wear this with slightly more
tight-fitting bottoms so by that I mean
things like leggings at the moment as
you'll see I'm wearing leather leggings
and over knee boots I find that the
tightness and the slim fitting style of
the leggings really helps to contrast
the big baggy silhouette off the top so
that would be my next tip for wearing
chunky knitwear is to balance it out
with something a little bit more slim
fitting on the bottom the next thing
that I picked up from Topshop is this
amazing roll neck jumper in this plain
gray color when it comes to layering a
roll neck like this as a real core
starting block and indeed a bit of a
basic when it comes to your entire
winter wardrobe because they're so
fabulous for layering and it's nice to
have something close to the skin that
really keeps the warmth in I definitely
recommend going for neutral color such
as a grey a light grey of black or brown
or even a white those will go with most
of your outfit combinations and look out
for a material that's nice and soft on
the skin too there is nothing worse than
having an itch material right close onto
the skin when it comes to layering the
best thing about a Rolo neck is that
because they're quite soon fitting they
do work under loads of different jumpers
for example one that I've picked up from
Topshop is this deep v-neck this of
course means you're going to see quite a
lot of the Rolo neck underneath which
makes it all the more important that you
do go for a slightly more neutral color
so I have pot the lighter gray v-neck
jumper on over the top of the row neck
to show you how that looks as you can
see this piece is really dreamy for
layering it's got these slits in the
sleeves which help to show off the piece
you've got underneath and then this deep
v-neck is just crying out for a
beautiful statement necklace as well so
a nice way to add a little bit of detail
to your outfit the final piece that I'm
going to show you for over the top of my
row neck jumper is a really big chunky
knit I personally absolutely love
wearing this without anything on
underneath but I just wanted to show you
that you can create an extra layer of
warmth by putting a chunky knit over a
real neck jumper such as this one so at
the moment I've got three layers on I've
got my thermal top underneath I've got
my row neck jumper and then my chunky
knit so definitely a great outfit for
those chilly adays plus I just think
that this kind of jumper is a great
statement piece a real cool fashion item
for your winter wardrobe and so many
outfits do look great with a chunky
jumper such as this one you could even
wear this over top of a dress to make it
have that really cute kind of Nordic
cozy vibes pair it with a skirt leather
leggings suede leggings so many outfits
just look great with a chunky knit such
as this one so we all know that I don't
wear a lot of black I don't personally
feel like it does that much for my
skintone but
do feel like a black knit is an
essential piece for your autumn winter
wardrobe so I decided to try this one
out from Topshop I really liked the neck
detail it's got like a pie crust ruffle
detail around the neckline which I
really like
it does have some little holes in the
knitwear which you can see my white
thermal top underneath poking through so
I definitely need to remember to get a
black Cemil to wear underneath something
like this but I did want to get this one
to really experiment with layering with
things like scarves and for my coats and
my outerwear because I'm finding that
because a lot of my coats are camel or
like grey my whole outfit just looks
very very light so what I'm gonna try
doing is layering this up with my usual
kind of shade of coat to see how that
looks
so this scarf I thought would be a
really versatile one it has got two
different shades you've got this camel
color on one side and then it's more of
a grey white on the other which I
thought could be useful for making a few
really nice different effects hopefully
the pie crust of the jumper will still
show through when I bundle myself up in
the scarf and then I picked up a camel
colored coat definitely more my kind of
color palette I saw this one it was 89
pounds which I thought you're getting a
lot of code here for 89 pounds so I was
really intrigued to try this out so this
is a serious layering outfit going on
here I feel totally snugly and all
bundled in together this color
combination at the top here I really
like and it's nice to get a little bit
of the dark black jumper underneath
showing through it just adds a really
nice other color element to the outfit
and it's not too light which is what I
was trying to avoid by getting this
jumper into my autumn wardrobe I really
am very impressed with this coat for 89
pounds I think you're getting so much
coat for your money here there's lots of
different elements to it not only is it
a really long coat and a lovely thick
material which hopefully means it's
going to be very warm but also you've
got this tie cuff detail on the sleeves
you've got some faux fur around the
collar around the neckline and I can
definitely imagine bloggers or like
fashion editors wearing this type of
thing at New York Fashion Week London
Fashion Week it definitely feels like
that kind of vibe so this is how the
coat looks from a full-length angle as
you can see it's just so nice having
this lighter color from the scarf
showing through I've tied everything
together with a waist belt which is a
really nice way of still adding that
feminine silhouette when you do want to
bundle up with lots of different layers
try finding a coat that does have a tie
waist or maybe even a belt to bundle
everything in
together and that way you hopefully
won't look like a marshmallow with all
your different layers on I'm also really
liking the contrast between the lighter
colors are slightly more beige and the
nudes of the coat and the scarf and then
underneath I do have my darker colored
leggings on underneath as well and then
my black jumper so ties in really really
nicely and then you've got a chic dark
outfit on until next up we have another
real cool piece for an autumn winter
wardrobe and it is a big gray chunky net
personally I really love the sleeves on
this one you've almost got a fluted or
trumpet-style sleeve which as you know I
absolutely love just brings in a real
nice design element to the jumper but
other than that it's a total plain
classic piece I really like this
ginormous neckline as well and because
it is that beautiful loose fit you can
layer this with so many things
underneath you could put a roll neck
underneath we could put a thumb
underneath you guys gonna get so bored
of me talking about thermals but because
it's so roomy it really is a great piece
for layering once again when you want to
head outside adding in a scarf is a
beautiful way of adding in some extra
warmth as well as looking stylish and I
love the color combination of grey and
Pink's I've gone for this one
Topshop have a really lovely selection
of scarves I think that the designs are
really lovely the colors are just the
colors that work so well with your
wardrobe and a great price as well this
one was sixteen pounds which i think is
great so let's see what this one looks
like layered with the grey jumper okay
that is a dreamy color combination
really really pleased with the way that
these two tones go with each other
definitely two pieces I'll be wearing
together in the cold month let me know
what you guys think and the next layer
that I'm going to add on is a coat so
this is one that I picked up in my
latest Topshop haul again I think it's
really good value this is sixty five
pounds and it's a really nice length as
well quite a smart length perhaps if
you're looking for a coat that you can
wear to school or for work that kind of
thing I think this one could be a really
good contender the style of this coat as
well means that it can be worn just over
the shoulders in that very typical kind
of fashion blogger style I think it
looks really nice like that this way of
wearing the coat works really well with
this style of trumpet sleeve jumper as
well so if you do have a lot of Trumpets
leave or fluted sleeve jumpers or even
ruffle sleeves then you'll know that
putting your arms down the holes of a
coat is a little bit impractical so this
is a really great way of layering these
three pieces together when you put the
coat on properly again
get that really lovely color combination
of the pink and the gray I think he's
working really nicely together and then
it's really lovely that the coat is
lightened up a little bit and you get
that luxe detail with the camel colored
faux fur that I am a big big fan of so
as you can see all bundled up in the
coat the gray and the pink looking so so
beautiful together you've got this very
smart neckline and the faux fur at the
back there and I'm really liking this
double-breasted button detail of course
you can wear it undone as well but I
think done up it really adds to a very
elegant and feminine silhouette okay so
a couple more pieces I picked up in the
Top Shop haul and I wanted to share with
you these boots because I think they are
absolutely stunning and again a very
classic piece for the winter wardrobe
heel height is amazing very comfortable
very practical for wearing all day long
and then this faux croc effect leather I
also find very versatile it doesn't
really scratch the deep color so it
should be very flattering if you want to
wear with black tights dark leggings
dark jeans should be a very versatile
shade for that and I really like the
design detail of the silver disc but
almost kind of sixties shape of the heel
I think they're absolutely beautiful so
I'll definitely be styling these up with
lots of different outfit combinations
let me know what you guys think to these
in the comments down below so for these
ones I definitely want your opinion
because they're a little bit out there
in my head when I was ordering these I
was imagining an outfit with the jumper
such as this one a pair of real plain
jeans and then a jazzy pair of rose gold
boots at the end to just add something a
little bit exciting to what could be a
bit of a basic outfit of the day a
stylish one on the last but quite basic
so what do you guys think I thought they
were very jazzy very cool they were 59
pounds so not ridiculously expensive
they have a fairly low stiletto heel so
should be actually quite comfortable and
then they are pointed toe as well which
I think makes them suitable for like an
evening boot as well perhaps if you want
to wear jeans and some stylish pointed
toe boots in the evenings then these
could be a really nice option but yeah
rose gold metallic boots I got very
excited when I saw them so let me know
if you've got any outfit combinations
that you think needs would work well for
then and I'd very much appreciate your
thoughts in the comment section so yes
do let me know what you think about
these ones
the next shoes that I picked up are this
pair of boots I'd spotted these on the
website when they came out maybe two or
three weeks ago and I had been lusting
over them and decided to finally bite
the bullet what I love about these the
most
is the heel I'm hoping that you'll be
able to see this it's almost like a
tortoiseshell clear acrylic heel don't
know if the light is going through these
enough for you to see but the heel I
think makes these really really stylish
they look a little bit pink but they are
actually a cream color very very soft
leather and for 85 pounds they are a
premium boot but not too crazy you can
imagine designers doing boots like this
and then costing well over four five
hundred pounds and hopefully they will
have that effect in really elevating a
jeans and a knit wear kind of outfit and
now a final few pieces that I picked up
from Topshop comm recently I'm really
loving picking up new knitwear at the
moment and anything that has some slight
design details that make it a little bit
more unusual I get very excited about so
I really fell in love with this jumper I
really like necklines it almost like a
slit at the top I find them very
feminine very flattering and then this
one has that exact style neckline and
also some statement buttons as well
quite a simple design detail but I
thought it just made this really really
lovely and other than that it's just a
plain white knit so hopefully something
will be very easy to wear that'll work
with jeans that'll work over skirts
lots of different wintery outfit
combinations and once again a piece you
can layer up with a thermal underneath a
scarf coats she lays etc etc I think
this will be a piece that I get a lot of
use out of so that's something that I'm
very happy to have picked up from my
last order also you guys know how much I
love this ruffle detail around the
collar I think you call it like a pie
crust detail this I thought would be a
great base layer it has that detail on
the top and on the sleeves this is quite
an unusual color choice for me but I
thought once again for layering it would
be a really nice slightly different
neutral shade not too bold but a nice
way to inject a slightly different color
into my outfits and last but absolutely
not least I picked up a new pair of the
classic Topshop Jamie jeans now these
have contrast stitching in them which is
a slight change to the other Jamie jeans
that I have in my wardrobe but these for
me are universally the most flattering
jeans I get compliments when I'm wearing
them people ask where my jeans are from
and they're so shocked when I tell them
that their top shop Jamie's if you guys
haven't tried at this dive Jean before
then I highly recommend it they just
look so incredible on everyone you can
wear them loads wash them loads and they
their shape I just have nothing but
positive things to say about Topshop
Jamie jeans personally I like my jeans
to be quite high-waisted I feel most
comfortable in that design and find it
the most flattering so that's just
another way that Jamie jeans tick all
the boxes for me so when I saw this
contrast stitch design I thought I just
had to add these to my Topshop Jamie
jeans collection so that's everything
that I have picked up recently from
Topshop I really hope you enjoyed
looking through all my new pieces with
me and also those added tips for
layering as well let me know if you like
