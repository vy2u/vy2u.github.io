Listerine who challenged me to get
whiter teeth in two weeks using the
Listerine advanced white we all know
that first impressions are key and a
brighter whiter smile makes us feel more
confident more bold and perhaps so much
both that were willing to try something
new using the product the morning and
night to two weeks helps you go to
whiter smiles and brushing alone and for
me as I grew to love my smile more and
more it gave me the confidence to try
something new so yes you're going to see
me in some totally new trends and new
shapes and new colorways I hope this
video inspires you to try something new
and why not start by getting that extra
boost of confidence with a whiter smile
