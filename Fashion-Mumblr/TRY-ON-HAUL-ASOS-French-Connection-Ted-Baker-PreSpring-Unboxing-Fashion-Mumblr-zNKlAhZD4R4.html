super week today I thought I absolutely
had to film a whole video for you
because I've been getting really quite
spendy which is actually quite unusual
for me I know you're probably rolling
your eyes but I don't actually shop that
much but when I do I buy quite a lot I'm
going to stop trying to justify the fact
that I don't buy a lot because yeah I'm
just like myself anyway so I got
spending quite a few places including
ASOS and that is not the only box I'm
ashamed to say and also Ted Baker which
I haven't actually opened yet and it's a
carrier bag and also a rather snazzy
suit holder it's just a cave in there
not a suit and then also today bit of
the last minute I also went into French
Connection and picked up a few pieces so
this is going to be a collective haul
video I'm going to try some bits on as
well and show you how they look on and
so yeah quite a lot of pieces a lot of
pre spring and springtime pieces I
always get spendy at this time of year
just because I love springtime
I love spring colors I love pastels I
have white out of pink I love lace I
love florals so this is definitely my
time of year for clothes shopping
and so yeah before I ramble any further
let's get started so I'm going to start
off with a sauce and I'm going to show
you a few accessories or accessories
just sunglasses which I picked up from
ASOS because otherwise I can tell
they're going to get lost under a huge
pile of products and the first pair that
I picked up is this kind of I'm not sure
how to describe this but it's almost
like a blue marble along the edge there
aviator style glasses and then a very
flat blue dark blue lens with gold stems
and pinging me back these are ASOS own
brand and I just saw they're a really
lovely pattern you've got the blue on
the earpieces as well and I really love
this style of sunglasses I thought
they're quite a classic shape and it's
quite strange how they're so flat though
it's really hard to describe it as
literal
just a flat piece of plastic not sure if
you can see that so these I believe
around 12 pound per pound mark from a
sauce then I treated myself to a couple
of pairs of key Australia sunglasses
I've become a little bit obsessed with
them recently since my gold kind of
laser cut ones which I think you guys
saw in my February favorites but I also
picked up these which are kind of marble
e-print around the outside and then
really quite mirrored lenses and on the
lens so yeah I thought these are really
really pretty just quite nice and
they're kind of casual but really big
casual and I love that they don't have
the I bits here so it means I can put it
on my head and my hair doesn't get stuck
in language if you have really naughty
hair like I do that is always a
consideration I believe these ones
around the 25 pound mark so not super
expensive I'd rather have a few pair of
these and one pair of like Chanel
adoption Gabbana glasses so really happy
with those and last but not least when
it comes to sunglasses one more key pair
and the key Australian ones all come in
these little pouches which is quite
handy I picked up another kind of rose
gold pair these have got a really
awesome cat flick detail again with a
bit of a cutout and I just love the
color they definitely have like rose
tinted lenses which I think are just
really really cute they do have them
nose bit so when we're putting those on
my hair too much but I just absolutely
love the kind of bluey pink almost
iridescent and they're made kind of
color of the lenses and I've already
been wearing these quite a lot so three
lovely new pairs of sunglasses from ASOS
then like I normally do I picked up some
branded things from ASOS so this skirt
is actually a River Island skirt it's
going to go really cruising the lighting
so I'll insert a clip of me wearing it
but this is just such a gorgeous skirt I
absolutely love the fabric on this skirt
even though it's quite short the fabric
is kind of thick and almost knitted with
these little peephole details not people
that we wear
I'm kind of like a whole lazy hole
details which is makes it look a little
more elegant and feminine and quite
classic and not you know not too skimpy
like a skirt this length normally would
be and it's stretchy as well which makes
it super comfortable and I wear this
just above my hips so it's nice and
flattering and then it's got this flare
at the bottom which just gives it a
lovely really girly shape so that was a
sauce but it's a river island and this
was 32 pounds which i think is really
good for a skirt of this quality I'm
sure I'll be getting a lot of wear out
of that come summer and also any
holidays as well sticking to the white
kind of summery theme I picked up this
really light lace jacket also from a
sauce but this is super trash so this if
you can see has got a lovely kind of
lace fabric all over almost like a
broderie anglaise kind of lace 3/4
sleeves and this is the kind of thing
when you're on holiday in the evenings
you just want to have a little something
over your shoulder nothing too warm
because obviously it's normally hot when
you're on holiday but this is just a
lovely thing to kind of keep the wind
off keep the chill off in the evenings
when you leave on holiday or it's nice
and warm in the UK and yeah it's just a
plain lace very simple design very
classic and very me so I really love
that one something a little bit more
casual is this pink top that I got from
ASOS and this is a sauce own brand this
is literally just a pink t-shirt with a
bit of a V detail going on in the back
here with almost 3/4 sleeves a little
bit of detail on the sleeve there but
really really plain it this is the kind
of thing that I just look at chopping
with jeans maybe even white jeans in the
summertime in the springtime really nice
piece for layering it's just such a
casual but such an easy to wear kind of
piece so this is pretty much a spring
basic and I'm surely wearing this a lot
in summer it's almost got two kind of
silky feel to the fabric which I really
really like hangs beautifully and I just
absolutely adore the color and also a
very very springtime piece is this
little cute pair of shorts with this
gorgeous kind of floral petal detail at
the top now these are very short shorts
so I think they'll probably just be
reserved for any holiday
I go on but I just fell in love with
this data I think it's so fun and girly
but without being too kind of cutesy
cutesy I know it's very cutesy but I
just thought it was a really lovely
detail again really high waisted which
for me got tiny legs so high-waisted is
definitely the most flattering and a
lovely lovely light pink color and nice
light material so again a lovely one for
holidays this top is from a brand called
fashion Union which I'd heard of but
never tried anything before but I really
loved the stripe design on this I love
stripes anyway so anything that's pink
and stripe is pretty much ticking all of
my boxes and the tick another box it's
high neck as well which just makes it
absolutely wonderful I really love the
design of this as well it's almost like
crop and then it flares out with the
stripes going in different ways so it's
going to give a really lovely flow the
way the fabrics been cut again I can
imagine wearing this with either jeans
or maybe forgets a woman with like a
white denim shorts or something I think
this will be a really cute one I think
this was really cheap as well karma more
exactly how much I will leave the
details down below and you can go and
check it out and again a really really
light fabric I can imagine just sticking
on a bandeau top underneath this maybe
even a bikini top I don't know why I
think you're out holidays so much but
yeah really lovely light fabric so again
go to a really nice one once the weather
gets a bit warmer and also for those
lovely kind of spring mornings I picked
up this skirt and this was a bit of an
investment piece this was a whistles
skirt but I got it again from ASOS and
this was 95 pounds so quite pricey so I
really need to be sure gang in aware
this but you can really tell the it's
good quality it's really thick material
and this color for me is like a wardrobe
staple classic pink color so I'm sure it
will go with a lot of my spring outfits
but as I said I'm going to try it on
with a few different options just to
make sure it's worth the money so it's
definitely not cheap but again beautiful
design quite a plain almost a line kind
of skirt and then you've got these faux
actually they are real popper buttoned
details down the side which just gives a
little bit of interest to the skirt on
the back you've got the effect of a
couple of pockets but they aren't
actually doing anything just a nice
design detail and again this will fit
quite high-waisted
so a lovely flattering skirt for the
springtime another estas own-brand item
which I picked up is this black skirt
which has a school just black and white
tassel kind of frill detail around the
pockets and along the bottom here I just
thought this was very Chanel ash which
is why I picked this up I think it'd
make a really nice quite professional
piece so maybe if you work in office or
you get to wear what you want to school
I think this would be a really lovely
quite smart but still very fashionable
piece for those kind of situations I
think this one I'm not sure if I will
keep it because actually it's quite dark
for this time of year and I don't
actually wear that much back anyway I
kind of water on a bit of a whim but let
me know what you guys think in the
comments I mean if you have any outfit
suggestions for this because I do really
love it I'm just not sure how well it
will fit in with my wardrobe and if you
read my blog post on eight steps to
defining a personal style then you'll
know that if there are any pieces in
your wardrobe but do stick out then it's
likely that you just won't find the time
to wear them so let me know what you
guys think about that skirt I also
picked up a river island coat from ASOS
and this is actually really heavy so
this is a beautiful suede material I'm
pretty sure it's actual suede but then
it was only 80 pounds this entire coats
I don't think that's enough for this
amount of suede but it's single lines
there's no lining inside then you have
this tie waist detail and two beautiful
soft flowing lapels so really nice quite
casual fit so many of you guys commented
on the coat that I got from Orion in my
last haul which I wore loads during
Fashion Week annoyingly it sold out but
this is a very similar shape and I think
actually a little bit warmer as well so
I'm sure we'll be getting a lot of use
out of this at the back it's got kind of
like a cape detail which I find really
really flattering and again I love the
color this almost blush it is beige but
almost blush pink kind of suede I just
love and I'm short fit in really well
with the rest of my spring wardrobe this
next one I have a feeling is not going
to come across quite as well on camera
as it does in real life but it's this
kind of shirt dress with a broderie
anglaise kind of lace really big skirt
and it's French Connection but again
on a sauce but I bought this because I'm
going away next week or actually I'll be
there while you are watching this video
in Hong Kong and I just thought this was
such a lovely dress for that trip
because it's very light and summery with
these kind of 3/4 sleeves and a really
lovely midi-length skirt but the fabric
is so light that I just thought it would
be nice and cooling and really great for
an everyday dress while I was out there
I'm definitely going to be taking some
outfit shots and outfit videos while I
am in Hong Kong and but also make sure
you're following my snapchat and you'll
see what I'm getting up to but I pretty
much bought this dress for that trip I
just saw it and I was like that is so so
so perfect it's got a beautiful waist
band as well you've got this tire on the
waist which makes it really lovely and
flattering and I mean it's just white
dress white day dress so if you have
maybe like you're going to the races
there we go 10 Li or anything like that
this I just think is absolutely perfect
so it's French Connection and oily a
sort of taken off the prize I don't know
why they do that again I leave all the
information down below and then looking
around me I think this is the last thing
from ASOS I just picked up this hat
again I pretty much just fell in love
with the color this is definitely my
kind of color like a blushy purpley
grays color and it's a felt hat with
this really nice detail around the rim
so you've got it's almost I don't think
it's real leather but it's definitely
leather effect lace kind of detail
around here and you've got a couple of
tassels I absolutely love wearing hats
if I have like a bad hair day and I'll
stick a hat on if I'm a bit cold or
stick a hat on and I just absolutely
love this color so let me know what you
guys think of the Hat oh and I've just
spotted this set of silk pajamas from a
sauce that obviously not real silk but
they definitely feel like it I picked up
this because I'm actually in love with
my Olivia van halfa dramas which are
real silk for if you have researched on
me online they are very very pricey and
I was gifted them I do not have that
amount of money to spend on pajamas but
these definitely reminded me of them
obviously not quite the same material
and quality wise but really lovely
shapes I got a light blue silky shirt
and matching bottoms I really like to
have like full bottoms when I'm in bed I
quite like to be really cozy but
this lovely silky material means I don't
get too hot so I thought that was a nice
little pyjama treat I really buy pajamas
actually so yeah when I saw that I
thought they were really really
beautiful next I'm going to move on to
Ted Baker in here are a couple of bits
which I picked up from Click &amp;amp; Collect
today but I actually have a couple of
bits which I bought in a previous trip
one of which is this jumper that I'm
wearing now you might have seen this in
a few other videos or if you follow me
on snapchat I know quite a few people
commented saying my jumper from on my
snapchat well this is it and it is Ted
Baker so you can see it's a high-neck
long-sleeve and jumper with this almost
chevron design not sure if the cameras
picking that up which I find really
really flattering now what I love about
Ted Baker is that all the little details
are rose gold so I'm gonna show you not
sure if you can see down here but it's
got this tag here which is rose gold
which I absolutely love and I just
really like the fit of this it's very
classic fits me really perfectly and Ted
Baker knitwear I always find really good
quality so although this was more
expensive than like a Topshop jumper or
even like an 8 oz jumper I know that
this design in particular is so me and
I'll wear it absolutely loads I already
have done and then I also picked up
another jumper which is this one here
it's more white and quite sheer this
bits quite sure you can probably see my
hand going through it but then you've
got these beautiful white and pink
stitches going across and again you've
got a little bit of rose gold detail in
this little Ted Baker button down here
those little design details I just
absolutely love again this is a
beautiful shape I actually wore this
with the river island skirt though
showed you earlier for an outfit shoot
so if I have any photos from that I'll
leave them up here and leave a link to
the blog post down below um but yeah I
just thought this was really beautiful
colors I was feeling quite spendy so I
wouldn't normally go this crazy on
jumpers but I do love a good light
jumper in springtime and thought these
two were just absolutely perfect and
also in that particular haul I picked up
this pair of trousers I'm always on the
lookout for smart trousers which aren't
denim and because I just think they're
really nice to wear as an everyday
trouser but you know sometimes you just
want to be a little bit more dressed up
than denim and I
just absolutely adored the fabric on
these it's a pale blue fabric and the
design it's they've used a very sateen
II almost shimmery thread to give almost
like a skeleton leaf kind of pattern
it's really hard to describe the pattern
on these and also something I love about
Ted Baker's it will have beautiful
design details so this has got this
beautiful floral pastel material on the
hem I know when you're wearing it you
can't see it but it's just like knowing
that those beautiful design details are
there that I absolutely love the only
negative thing I have to say about these
trousers is when I tried them on the
button popped off and like they're not
too small for me nothing like that but
it pinged off it's not a huge problem
because I can just sew it back on but
when you spend how much were they done
five burn 21:29 pounds on a pair of
trousers you don't really want the
button flying off so I will have a gain
a good old thing about whether I keep
these I do love them but I'm not sure if
I can justify almost 130 pounds on a
pair of trousers so let's have a little
look at the Ted Baker stuff which I
picked up from my click and Collect
order this morning the first thing is
this jumper which I already absolutely
love so it's a cardigan which I really
like because sometimes especially like
when you're going on a long-haul flight
or if you're doing some traveling
cardigans are just so great so you can
just put the move your shoulders and be
automatically really comfy and I love
the colors on this white on the top half
gray on the bottom half two of my
absolute favorite colors and the
material is so soft I wonder if it's
cashmere I can't remember if it's yeah
cashmere color-block wrap which is
absolutely gorgeous
I will definitely be wearing this to
travel and yeah really beautiful design
Ted Baker knitwear as I said really
really good quality so definitely
looking forward to wearing that one and
I also picked up another high neck this
is a funnel neck pink jumper but I
actually bought this one and this one
with the intention of comparing the two
but this one arrived much folia and I
loved it and I started wearing it so
this one definitely can't be returned so
for that reason sadly I think this one
is going to go back but I'll show you
anyway it's basically a very plain pink
roll neck with a really high neck detail
there and then you've got the beautiful
rose gold Ted Baker detail that I always
look out for and this
was 99 pounds so just a little bit too
much for a roll neck in my opinion but
yeah thought I would show you that one
anyway and then in my suit case suit
cover there is this beautiful cape which
I'll get out the wrapping and show you
properly there we go so spring I feel is
a really nice time of year to wear capes
because it still is definitely a little
bit chilly at least here in London but
you don't want necessarily to have a big
full-on wintery coat on so I thought I'd
try out a cape which I've not really
done before this is a really nice plain
gray material your arms come out of
these holes here again you've got the
rose gold clasp here and really love
this grey color I think it's very
universally flattering anyone can get
away with it and then the lining is this
lovely blush pink color it might be
quite fiddly to secure yourself in it
with these two kind of poppers there and
then you've got a third final popper
over here to close it and then inside
it's just plain grey not lined which I'm
a little bit surprised at but then you
have got the beautiful pink and trimming
detail along all the hems and then last
but by no means least we have a French
Connection and this was a little bit of
an impulse purchase from me today but
again because I'm going on to Hong Kong
in a few days I kind of picked these up
for that trip and as I said I'll be
doing some outfit videos so that was my
way of justifying these purchases so
inside the bag everything is wrapped in
tissue paper which I'm going to shred
and I picked up three quite basic things
so the first of which is this really
lovely almost silky t-shirt the back is
more of a plain cotton material whereas
the front feels silky let's have a look
what material it is probably polyester
yeah it's polyester but you know when
they make it really nice and thin so it
feels like silk and I just find that
white t-shirts are such a plain item
that I will wear something like this so
much so this was 35 pounds which I don't
even think is that expensive like
Topshop you'd spend that amount of money
on a Topshop t-shirt if it was from the
boutique section and it is really
gorgeous the fact that it's this silky
material on the front and cotton on the
back makes it really comfy and then
you've got this cutout detail around the
hair
around the neckline sorry which just
gives it that little bit of design
detail which you expect from somewhere
like French Connection equal you've got
that same design detail on the arms and
it's really beautiful just it's so
simple but really makes this t-shirt a
little bit more special similarly I
picked up this white tank top with
adjustable straps and it's got the same
detail cotton on the back white silky
polyester on the front with this lovely
cutout detail exactly the same as the
t-shirt and again this kind of thing I
layer under everything in springtime I
absolutely love things like this the
pieces that I've picked up like this in
previous years have been amongst my most
worn items and this was twenty-two
pounds so I really do not begrudge
spending twenty-two pounds on something
this classic and the fact that it's
adjustable sleeves is really great as
well because sometimes you just want it
to be a little bit higher on to be a
little bit more conservative or on those
days and it's nice and sunny you want to
reveal your chest a bit then you can let
it down so that's absolutely perfect so
many of my tank tops I have to take up
the sleeves myself like chop them up and
sew them again because they're not quite
the right length so it's just really
nice that these are adjustable and
finally last but not least I picked up
the very plain gray jumper from French
Connection I have a thing with gray
jumpers I wear them so much they are
definitely amongst the most warm items
warm and worn items in my wardrobe this
one was 55 pounds it's got the VD tail
along the front here not sure if you can
see that and then just quite chunky
three-quarter length sleeves this is
what I am what I saw in the store that
really made me make a purchase just
because gray jumpers with a reasonably
high neck are the kind of things I
absolutely live in and especially when
it goes into spring time sometimes pink
I just feel like I can get the collar a
little bit dirty and it feels too dressy
to wear something like this at home
whereas this is a lovely quite smart and
chic jumper but you can wear it out
about and at home as well and just be
super comfy and know that you're looking
chic as well so really pleased with my
french connection purchases I feel like
I went in there expecting that
everything is going to be a lot more
expensive and then when my bill came to
just over 100 pounds also oh actually
I've got three really nice really
classical pieces for that so really
pleased with my little splurge better
so looking forward to wearing all these
pieces as I said sprays my favorite time
of year for fashion and I love
everything the colors of our breaks just
everything about it I love so I hope you
guys have enjoyed this haul give it
thumbs up if you did let me know which
pieces are your favorites if is only
that you don't like that you think I
should send back and as I said I'm
really not that splurge E but this time
of year is just my time of year for
shopping so yeah went a little bit crazy
and I may or may not have a chop shop in
river island haul coming up very soon as
well so if you want to see what I got
from there
keep your eyes peeled make sure you
subscribed and all of that good stuff
so yeah that's all from me if you want
to check out my Hong Kong adventures and
be sure to follow me on snapchat sorry
snapping loads and yes OC on my next
video bye bye
