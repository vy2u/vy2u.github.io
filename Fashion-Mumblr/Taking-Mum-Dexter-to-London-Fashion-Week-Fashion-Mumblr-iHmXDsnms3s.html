one and only London Fashion Week vlog so
today is actually Tuesday which is the
final day of London Fashion Week and I
did go on Monday and Sunday as well but
as I had so much on those days I was
doing Instagram takeovers I was doing my
own content and I had tons of shows to
go to I didn't vlog them because I just
didn't want to add another thing to my
to-do list but they were a really busy
couple of days on Sunday I did an
Instagram take over for label online
which is next kind of brand it's next
branded section so I was wearing all
label online from Ted Baker and Kurt
Geiger and I didn't Instagram take of
them and I also went to the Jay Jay SLE
show as a guest of L'Oreal and I went
backstage and saw L'Oreal professional
doing the hair and makeup which was
really really lovely and that was at the
Conde Nast college they're really lovely
to see the backstage action and then the
presentation for JJ Utley and then
yesterday Monday was a really fun day as
well I started off by going to the rock
sander show which was absolutely
stunning again I was a guest of Loreal
Pro I was sat on the front row which was
insane I was actually put next to Anna
Wintour when I first arrived I knew I
was not in the right place and obviously
I got moved along that's still in the
front row so that was quite an
interesting slightly embarrassing
experience but yeah front row rocks
under was incredible once again with
L'Oreal professional who did the hair
for the show which was absolutely
gorgeous
then into a taxi or actually a high-end
eye which was provided by the apartment
they're collaborating this year I then
went to one Marylebone to the Pringle
show where L'Oreal Paris had done the
hand makeup so that was another really
really beautiful show one Marylebone is
such the stunning locations that was
real privilege to get to go to that and
finally after a change of clothes I went
backstage at Ashish which was so
beautiful so colorful and Tony and I
were doing the hair band
guests of Toni &amp;amp; Guy so it's really
hectic and busy amazing atmosphere
backstage and then the show was in the
British Fashion Council show space and
it was all kind of 1950s Bollywood style
they had live Indian music the clothes
are just incredible so bright and lots
of embellishment as you can imagine from
Ashish once again on the front row so a
very surreal couple of days today um I
thought I would just do a little quick
get ready with me which you guys saw a
second ago because I wanted to share a
few of the products which I have been
loving and pretty much doing this exact
face every day for Fashion Week so I'll
just show you what I used and first of
all the deck lay or hydrofluoric and
this is an SPF 30 and it's
anti-pollution so I've been using this
as the final step in my skincare routine
and because obviously Fashion Week is in
Soho the pollution there is one of the
worst places in the world
so anti-pollution skincare is top of my
list at the moment and because this is
deklay or it's just so lovely and
luxurious so I pop down first and then
I've been using the Vichy dermablend 3d
correction that's this one and it's
corrective resurfacing active foundation
16 hour wear and I really like this
because at the moment my skin is not too
good I've got a few blemishes and this
gives incredible coverage really good
for photos it just photographs really
really well covers on my blemishes and
last for such a long time so been
obsessed with this and then my shantak
eye HD perfecting powder the bronzing
version which just perfects my base and
again sets it down for the whole day
long on my eyes I've been using a new
Gillan palette they're autumn winter
palettes by just absolutely stunning and
the perfect colors for a neutral smokey
eye usual brow routine benefits brow
products clarence mascara and then a
stealer lipliner from look fantastic and
a shang-chi lipstick which is cold
let's have a look a mirage lipstick from
Shantae eye which is like my favorite
lipstick of the month so that's my make
for the day and I'm going at fairly
casual outfit wise today because I'm
actually taking Dexter with me and my
mum we're all going to Fashion Week
together I wasn't planning on
going into exile got a lot of work to
catch up on but then I remember that
I've got tickets from the sunglass hut
who are the main sponsors of Fashion
Week they've kindly given me two tickets
to Emilio delle merino
which is on today at 2:00 so I thought I
would bring mother along with me because
it will be a really nice experience and
the show will be very up her street with
lots of beautiful dresses so we're going
to head out to that shortly and we're
going to take Dexter with us - we
probably going to leave them in the car
during the actual show and but there's a
puppy afternoon tea going on at the
apartment so it might be fun to take you
along to that I have my hair done in
these really nice plats yesterday at the
apartment I think it needs redoing so
luckily evaders sent me some of their
dry shampoo so I'm just going to
sprinkle some of that into my roots and
then freshen up my style ready to head
out
so we are ready to go lillas getting
camera shy let's do our outfit of the
days so I'm I'm not doing anything with
my hair because hopefully by the time we
get to Soho someone at the apartment can
do some plats for me
I've got sunglass hut me new glasses on
and then this lovely bed oh and then
this lovely necklace is from Ted Baker I
thought this jumper needed jazzing up

Aspen all I actually personalized it in
the apartment yesterday just got my
initials on it and then H&amp;amp;M jeans and
these boots are from a brand called
shimmy and I swear they're like under 30

hello darlings from back home again I
feel like I didn't really long without
much during Fashion Week just kind of
had some food at the apartment and was
relaxing with mom and then we went and
did a little bit of shopping so I didn't
vlog because I had a dog I had bags and
yeah I didn't have a spare hand but as
we were driving home we went via
dajjal's I have a little bit of blogger
mail so to make up for rubbish Fashion
Week vlogging I thought we could do a
little bit of unboxing and but before I
do that I feel like I haven't really
blogged like this in a little while I
think it's maybe even a couple of weeks
and I forgot how much I liked vlogging
so let me know your thoughts on vlog
tober I know I always set myself these
challenges but you know what I like to
do I like to say I'll put up a video
every day but no stress if there isn't
one but vlogging is quite easy it's just
me filming what I'm doing so let me know
if you'd like me to do with October it
might be a case of a mixture of vlogs
and like sit down any kind of videos but
I mean I'm not going to lie I noticed
that my subscribers grow a lot more when
I do regular videos so perhaps it could
be a little tactic to hit the next
milestone so yeah let me know your
thoughts on 4 October um so yeah home
now it just made myself a nice cup of
coffee and I will open up the blogger
mail and show you what's inside
okay so we have a lovely selection of
products I'm going to start over here so
this is a little set of goodies from
fresh and I've never really been focused
I've never really known where to buy
fresh before because I've always bought
it from Sephora but I just found out
they have a store in Marylebone which is
a beautiful store these are their new
sugar cream lip treatments and I am very
excited by the lip of thing is that
still they actually look like and as you
can see they've also put in some cute
little lollies which just look amazing
Liz it's a squeezy tube normally they
are those twisty things that looks
amazing I've got the pink one and the
blush one and cute how cute is this

and in for every this year the body shop
started the enriched not to exploit
commitment and it's part of their in our
hands campaign which basically
encourages us to make small changes in
our lives which help the environment and
the planet so this change that they're
encouraging me to make is not to keep
getting Starbucks coffee cups instead
have my coffee in a reusable cup which
helps reduce landfill but yeah they're
trying to encourage everybody to make
small changes where that's meat-free
Mondays or just some small simple
recyclable things like this to make a
big change the planet so it's really
lovely campaign from the body shop I've
also been sent this new mascara which is
the photo / epic mascara and packaging

in a long time can't open it one-handed
without getting all over my hands but

fitness trackers and these I think they
measure your body fat as well so I'm
intrigued to give those a try and
