having a really super day today today's
video is something that's really quite
special to me it's something I've been
thinking about filming for quite some
time a lot of you guys often comment on
my videos saying oh you're really happy
a really positive really optimistic and
it's something that I do also get told
quite a lot in everyday life so I
thought I would put together a few kind
of tips on the sort of things that I do
and the sort of mentalities it's good to
have if you want to be happier and more
positive and it really is an addictive
feeling once you get these thoughts into
your head and start including these
things into your daily routine it really
is such an incredible feeling so timing
wise this video works really perfectly
because last month I took part in the
nyanma happiness program and I actually
filmed a video all about it everyone
NIAMS channel which I'll link down below
but in short the neon happiness program
is focused around a range of core
products from neon including a candle of
body wash of body scrub and a room mist
all of which have the most incredible
fragrance but more than just the
products there is a program and a
handbook which tells you a little task
little step to do every single day for a
month which are really super easy to fit
into your daily routine and have such an
incredible impact or just giving you the
most amazing start or end to the day so
a lot of the things I'm going to talk
about in this video are tips which I
didn't pick up from the neon happiness
program and a few of which I have just
stuck in because they're things that I
do on a daily basis on a regular basis
as well so my first tip is a really
simple one and it is to choose happiness
when you wake up in the morning you can
decide whether you want to have a gloomy
day and just not really get anything
done or you can decide yourself okay
today I'm gonna be in a really good mood
I'm going to be positive I'm going to be
optimistic I'm gonna get stuff done and
I think that a few things in the neon
program really helped to kick start my
day such as going for a lovely long walk
getting outside it's so refreshing just
clears all the cobwebs and gives a
really good start to the day maybe even
starting the day with 10 minutes of yoga
there are loads of YouTube channels that
you can go to if you don't want to go to
a studio to do it and something like
that really is an incredible way to
start the day so by choosing
happiness then that's a great way to
start secondly to surround yourself with
positive people I think this is such an
impactful one there is an expression
that you are the average of your five
friends or something along those lines
and if you look around at your
friendship group and if you surround
yourself by positive people that have a
lovely optimistic outlook on life and
that will definitely rub off on you and
one thing that I would say is to make
sure you are that person that is always
really happy really fun to be around
because that is contagious
and people will really feed that from
you and absorb your happiness along
similar lines I have a quote which I
found well scouring the internet or
maybe I saw it on Instagram or something
but it really rang true to me and that
is don't compare your blooper reel to
someone else's highlights and I think
that's really important in this day and
age when we're all sharing the
highlights of our life on Instagram as
bloggers and youtubers and instagramers
we're particularly pro at this what you
see on our Instagram feed is only a tiny
portion of our lives so it's really not
a good idea to look at that and think oh
I'm not that glossy or I'm not that
fabulous I'm not that fashionable
because we're only showing the
highlights and I'm not saying that I
portrayed that in any way but even for
me it's really easy to compare myself to
other people and that is one thing that
instantly can bring you down so my tip
would be not to compare yourself because
what you see out there is never the full
picture something that the neon suggests
is to have a little bit of time away
from your computer away from your phone
switch off technology and it really does
help you to understand what else there
is in life other than what's behind your
computer screen when I switched off my
phone I did stuff that I've been meaning
to do in such a long time just like
repairing some curtains repairing a pair
of trousers just these small things that
really help to clear the mind
and also ticked a few things off my
admin list as well so stepping away from
technology not comparing yourself to
others has a really great impact on your
happiness
another tip and one which I find has a
huge amount of impact is sharing a
compliment I find that when I give a
compliment of course I get an incredible
feeling from how I make the other person
feel whether it's like oh that color
looks really fabulous on you I love your
shoes like your hair looks great today
these things make you feel good because
there's just some incredible feeling
when you give someone a compliment and
you see the happiness that you bring to
another person and it really doesn't
hurt you to give compliments so whether
it's a like and a comment on someone's
Instagram photo if they look really
great or whether it's just a stranger in
the street there really is such a lovely
feeling about giving someone a
compliment another tip is to keep your
mind engaged and this is also something
from the neon Happiness program they
suggest you exercise your mind and give
a couple of suggestions on how to do so
there are a couple of websites which
they recommend including a TED Talks
website and also languages website and
slowly but surely I've been starting to
reteach myself Spanish I used to be
really good at Spanish in school but
then over the years I've lost it but by
having one thing to focus on for me it's
the language for you it could be
starting up a new hobby starting a
YouTube channel or a blog just having
something other than work to really
engage your mind does have such a
positive effect on your happiness now
this one is super super easy and
enjoyable but it's really important to
give yourself a bit of me time this for
me was the main thing with a neon
happiness program as I said these super
easy steps just was an incredibly easy
to put into your daily routine one which
was one of my personal favourites was to
take a 15-minute bath in the evenings
now I don't do this every evening maybe
two or three times a week but by taking
a 15-minute bath and enjoying time again
away from technology and just really
zoning out and totally relaxing or
something like absolutely loved doing I
would use the neon great day wild mint
and Mandarin body scrub in the bath and
also during my time in the bath I used
something that Neel recommended which is
the 7-eleven breathing technique so
that's breathing in for seven seconds
and out for 11 seconds three times and
it is unbelievable the impact this has
just totally calming you out creating a
total Zen and really giving any stresses
off your mind which ultimately leads to
more happiness personally I love to do
this breathing technique in and out the
bath before my videos I do it as well to
just calm me down a little bit
and I find that it's really great for
just totally chilling you out something
else that always makes me feel really
good is by doing something positive for
other people such as giving to charity
personally I love to just have a huge
clear art and give a load of things to a
charity shop when you go into the shop
with your big bag of clothes or beauty
products the reaction from the shop
assistant is always so lovely they're so
grateful if you give them to charity and
at Christmas I love to fill a beauty box
or shoe box with beauty products for the
homeless and those in need things like
that really ask such happiness boosting
things to do and of course it's a really
lovely and positive thing to do as well
something else that I've started to do
since using the neon happiness program
is being a little bit more creative in
the kitchen so one of the NIAMS tips was
to create a smoothie bowl for me this
ended disastrously it was definitely not
Instagram Balazs those you see all over
Instagram and Pinterest but hey ho I had
a good laugh of doing it and that's what
the program is all about but it did make
me feel like I wanted to be a little bit
more creative in the kitchen we've just
got the new Thermomix and I've been
really is starting to create a lot of
things which I normally would have shot
bought such as pesto I made myself and
even creating my own frozen berry ice
cream so I've been a lot more creative
in the kitchen
and that was definitely inspired by the
neon happiness program that was another
one of their tips
something else that Neelam recommend is
giving on top of your personal admin and
for me this is the key thing in being
happy and chilled for the rest of the
day personally I'm a major list person I
love to write lists anyway but by
setting it down your goals in really
kind of bite-sized chunks and just
putting them down on paper so you can
see them and have that extreme
satisfaction of tipping ticking them off
then that really does take away off your
shoulders and allow you to be happy for
the rest of the day so that's something
that I kind of already did but having it
on the neon happiness program really set
it in stone
that's something that really does just
add a little bit more relaxation and
stress rhiness to your day if that makes
sense so that would be one thing that I
recommend you do if it's not something
that you already do so those are the
tips and tricks that I personally use to
keep happy and positive and optimistic
hopefully you guys will have picked out
a few there that hopefully you can bring
into your daily routine as well I
absolutely love taking part in the neon
happiness program if it sounds like
something that you would like to do then
I highly recommend it it really is so
simple you get all these beautiful
products from neon all of which I
absolutely love you guys know I've
talked about them on my channel on my
blog loads of notes before but the
happiness program really does help you
make time for those little things every
single day whether it's reading a book
going for a walk doing some yoga
incredibly quick and simple to fit into
your daily routine and they do have such
an amazing impact and if anything that
made me realize the importance of me
time and how much difference just taking
10 15 20 minutes out of your day to do
something for you the impact that that
has on the rest of your day so hopefully
you guys have enjoyed this video and
we'll pick up a few tips and try them
out for yourself let me know down in the
comments what you love to do to make you
feel happy and maybe we can try those
out as well hope you guys enjoyed this
