chatty relaxed and informal kind of get
ready with me slash testing our new
beauty products when I say relaxed and
informal I am literally wearing my
pajamas right now it is half past seven
and the lighting was fairly good and I
was about to do my makeup anyway so I
thought I would do it on camera and
because I'm planning on trying out lots
of new products and bits and bobs that
I've received recently so without
further ado I'm just going to get
started because I need my moisturizer to
sink in so this is the new Clinique pet
start hydra blur moisturizer and this
arrived yesterday so forgive me but i'm
going to read off the press release
which is right here so it's basically
saying that it preps skin for makeup
blurs imperfections controls oil and
brings you into focus with matt and
whispers a showing the hydra blur
technology etc etc so it sounds really
good let's see and how it works i'm
gonna pop some on now oh this is a
really wicked formula okay so i'm not
sure if you can see but it looks sick oh
my gosh this is really unusual so
normally if products are for oily skin
they're like a gel because cream
community voice skin a little bit more
oily but this is really textured that's
almost like honestly I've never seen
anything like that that's a really
unusual texture so maybe this is oh and
it feels really thick as well but it's a
very very unusual consistency so
considering I've put on quite big
dollops it's not actually going that far
so we do need quite a lot of this
products
remember I have to avoid my eyebrow area
because they are still recovering so I'm
just gonna put it on my forehead on my
eyes but avoiding the eyebrow area
according to the press release there are
also botanical extracts of algae in here
which have anti-inflammatory properties
so good if you have any areas of redness
and also seaweed which helps to control
the excess production of oil which stops
your pores from getting clogged up so
for my skin type this actually sounds
really really perfect
having said that it's something really
quickly so my skin feels slightly tacky
but you do actually wanted to slightly
tacky when you play your makeup just to
give your makeup something to really
cling on to and so this is going to be
available exclusively at Boots from the
2nd of September and then you'll be able
to get it at clinic counters nationwide
from the 7th of October so this is
coming in just a few weeks before I
start makeup up just gonna tie her back
because yeah we don't want to hair gonna
get my makeup for my foundation I'm
going to use this new one from Estee
Lauder and it's called the double
wearing nude cushion stick radiant
makeup so cushion foundation is all over
the place recently
L'Oreal have done one Lancome have done
one and they seem to be a really big
craze this is slightly different so if
you look at the applicator
yes it's dirty I did a snapchat first
impressions the other day you have to
basically twist the bottom to make it
come up through this hole in the sponge
and then you apply it with the sponge
directly to your face so there we go and
then you're going to dot it all over my
face and then just spread it out a
little bit so one of my main reasons for
using this particular foundation today
is because double way notoriously has a
really good coverage and I'm actually
going to fill in quite a few videos
today which means I do want some good
coverage on my skin
I'm actually not loving how the actual
sponge applies it so I might just do the
main as spreading it out and then switch
to a beauty blunder I'm actually going
to pop a little bit more on there
because as I said when I'm filming I do
need a good coverage also the sponge on
this does thankfully unscrew so if you
just want to use it without the sponge
you can do that and also makes it really
good for washing so nice and hygienic
when I first saw this as well I thought
it's gonna be really heavy I thought
this was glass but actually it's plastic
so it is nice and light for canning a
handbag now I'm just spreading this over
my face using a damp Beauty Blender I
just wet it as I usually do my body shop
bitumen a mist and it's applying really
really nicely it's quite a good color
match for my skin I've got the shade
tawny which is 3 w1 it's a really good
color match actually it's quite
turn shade a little bit yellowy but
that's that's quite good for my skin now
that this is all blended I can see that
it is actually a much lighter finish
than the usual Estee Lauder Double Wear
sometimes I find double wear is actually
too much for everyday wear I wear on
days for example if I'm going to a
wedding or summer winos go to lots of
photos taken because it is a very good
photographic finish but I do find it's
you having for everyday this I will
expect him to do the same but actually
the formula is much lighter I can
actually still see a few of my blemishes
through it which means I do need to go
in with a bit of concealer as well and
then powder too but first of all I'm
going to try out something that I've not
tried before and it's the Too Faced Born
This Way oil-free naturally radiant
concealer and the reason why I've got a
few two-faced products in my pile of
things to try is because Too Faced are
now in Selfridges so you can buy Too
Faced
I think previously it was just from
Debenhams but now you can get them in
Selfridges too so I've got quite a few
two-faced things to try out in this
video so I've applied the concealer to
the back of my hand and then I'm just
dotting it on my blemishes and areas of
redness and I'm just gonna Pat it in
with my finger this one is the shade
light/medium and it looks like why I
could cut match for me really good
coverage actually that was given a
really beautiful and natural not cakey
not drying at all just a really lovely
creamy finish over my premises which is
great and then I'm gonna Pat it just
close to my eyebrows to get rid of the
redness from the micro bleeding and then
anything that's left I just wipe over my
eyelids and that acts as a bit of a base
for my eyeshadow later on I'm taking a
lighter shade of the Too Faced Born This
Way concealer and I'm going to put this
under my eyes this is a shade light
which I think it's the lightest of the
models so it's a lot lighter than the
tube and because there's no
contamination going on under my eyes I'm
going to apply it directly with the doe
foot applicator so just a couple of
splotches under my eyes and then down my
nose which just creates a little bit of
a natural highlight - once again
starting by patting my finger
and then are going on Beautyblender
afterwards now that my base is complete
with the cream products I'm going to set
them and also add the tiniest bit more
coverage because I am filming today so
I'm going to use the bare minerals bare
Pro Foundation I have tried this one
before but the shade I had is a little
bit too light for me so now I've got
natural which is number 11 I'm going to
use again the brush which was designed
for use with this which just picks up
the perfect amount of product so going
straight from the powder onto my face
and this as you would with a normal
power you can apply it into the areas
where you get a little bit more oily or
where you want to set your makeup but
because this is a powder foundation you
can really just apply it everywhere for
that lovely even coverage I absolutely
love the finish of the skills hopefully
the camera is picking it up but it
really does just blur everything and
mattify but without getting rid of all
of your glow so really my dream finish
it does however create quite a wash of
color so it doesn't give your face much
contour it does kind of create one even
color all over your face so it's
important you do go in with some bronzer
or contour afterwards so my base is now
beautifully mattes and a very even color
so you can see I don't really have any
shadow left on my face so the next thing
for me is bronzer and this one again
arrived yesterday and it's from the
Estee edit this is the Barriss bronzer
in Oh 2 medium deep
I love ginormous bronzers this is such a
huge one as you saw us using this
ginormous mirror in the lid earlier and
it's got also this little kind of paints
flaps of highlight so you could actually
use a brush just to pick up this section
you could use as an eyeshadow or a
specific highlight but I'm gonna take my
Sigma brush and just very lightly to
start with I'm not sure how strong this
is and Pat that on there and as usual
starting under the cheekbones it's
actually quite a dark shade it's not
gone on very evenly I'm not sure if
that's some applying it over a powder
but let's do some blending and see how
it comes out I'm actually quite
surprised with this bronzer because it's
called the barest bronzer so I was
expecting it to be very natural but
actually the color is really really
intense and I'm quite tanned at the
moment so considering it's so dark on my
face
so actually really surprised me and to
start with it took a lot of blending so
I've had to blend this a lot to really
give it that smooth finish so I'm not
sure if that's the bronzer that's
actually not terribly blendable or
whether it's the mixture of products so
I put on my face first and that is the
downside of applying new things all in
one go but having blended it I do like
the finish it's still mattes but I have
got a bit of a natural glow thanks those
shimmer areas color wise it's a little
bit more red than my normal bronzers
which I do quite like I think it's quite
a natural color it's very heavily
pigmented especially Singh as it is
called the barest bronzer so it was not
quite expecting the amount of
pigmentation you can see where I took
the brush up onto my forehead
it really is quite a deep color so
hopefully that will look a little bit
more natural when I've got a bit more
makeup on in the viewfinder I really
look as though I've been out in the Sun
for a few hours too long I look like
I've burnt my forehead a little bit but
in real life it doesn't look that bad so
I'm going to move on and next I'm going
to do eyes and I have another two-faced
product here this is their chocolate bar
pallets which I've been dying to try for
so long and I was sent this by
Selfridges to celebrate Too Faced now
being available about rolling out yeah I
think it was on the 15th of August that
it went live in Selfridges so have a
look at this palette so many shades that
are right at my street I just absolutely
love Browns shimmery Browns pinky Browns
this is just the dream palette and it
smells like chocolate too so could not
be more perfect
first though I'm actually going to apply
the Too Faced shadow insurance
I don't usually apply anything on my
eyelids other than leftover concealer or
foundation so be interesting to see if
using an actual base will make any
difference as to how long it lasts or
the crease free ability this boasts 24
hour wear so we'll see about that so I'm
just gonna apply a teeny bit about the
size of a little bit of liquid came out
there about a third of a grain of rice
and then using my fingers just gonna dot
that on my eyelids and this looks quite
creamy when it comes out of the tube but
it's almost invisible quite liquidy when
you put it on the eyelids so I'm going
to give that just a
seconds to dry off fix it is quite
liquidy and I'm gonna take a look in the
palate to see what so we're gonna go for
I don't very too much when it comes to
eye makeup as you guys know but I might
go for this lovely salted caramel color
which is a bit warmer than what I
usually go for and maybe I might try a
sparkly eye as well so next to it it's a
shade marzipan which I'll probably use
for all over and then this shade up here
black forest truffle a lot of amazing
names I'm going to use to create that
smoky effect and I think I will use
white chocolate to highlight the brow
bone so let's give it a go
so that's the eyeshadow done as you saw
I also took that darker truffle shade on
the zoeva luxe precise shader and I just
tapped it into my lower lash line and
also almost pushed it onto my upper
lashes and this gives a really lovely
outline effect without the need for
liner which to be honest I usually skip
out completely in the summer so using a
darker shade and a narrow brush like
this is a really good tip it's a little
bit softer but I have gone a little bit
more bolder than I usually would on the
eyes and that palette just made it so
easy all those shades are absolutely
beautiful I have a feeling I'll be
getting a lot of use out of this and so
handy that they're now available in
Selfridges so that's the eye shadow done
next I'm going to curl my lashes and
apply a new mascara Rimmel have updated
their famous scandalize mascara and
they've bought it out in black and
lacquer so this is scandalize reloaded
they've completely changed the shape of
the brush so now you can get much closer
to the inner corner of the eyes to
create those really lovely big
voluminous lashes so I'm just starting
by curling my lashes with my trusty
tweezerman eyelash curlers just a gentle
squeeze on each eye and then sometimes I
take it out and give it a second squeeze
just to really open up those lashes and
you can see this brush is really bristly
so it's going to be really good at
getting in to the individual lashes to
really give that incredibly voluminous
effect and party they've also improved
the formula so it's not going to be
flaking off but also as long-lasting as
it is it's going to be easy to take off
for the end of the day so once again
I'll leave a note here as to how easy
this was to remove I've been wearing the
Clarins Brown mascara so much recently
that even just going in with one coat of
black mascara is really quite a shock
it's such an intense color and which is
really nice actually considering I've
gone quite bold with the eye shadow so
this looks really really nice it's
actually coating the lashes in quite a
fine way at the moment but I feel like a
second coat will make them really big
and bold i think thanks to the dark
shadow being pushed on my lash line and
how black this mascara is and I really
have wiggled it close to my lashes
absolutely no need for eyeliner this
black really is so intense that it gives
my eyes a really lovely
almost like a feline look and this is
pretty amazing considering I don't have
eyeliner on so I think it's something
that you definitely can skip out
especially in summer months I am so
impressed how intense this black is and
I'm not sure if I've even got the
blackest one let's see so this one is
called extreme black and it really
really is I have to say I've never
really noticed a mascara being this
black before and I'm now going in with a
second coat so really just adding in
that volume I am so impressed with this
mascara such a good one from the
drugstore especially I just love how my
lashes look so bold and so so so black
so they're not kidding when they say
extreme black as you can tell I haven't
done anything with my eyebrows I can't
at the moment because of my micro
bleeding and but what I'm gonna do is
just comb them out using the new bow
lashes that brow conditioning serum so
this will just give them a nice shape
even though I cannot add any color to
them I'm actually going in to get them
reat at it so when you get your brows
micro bladed you have to go in for weeks
off to your original appointment and
that will really add in a bit more color
so they have gone lovely and light again
but I do want them a teeny bit darker so
I'm gonna go in to see Sean next week
and get them done one more time the next
thing that I'm going to do is lips and I
have three absolutely gorgeous shades
from the Too Faced melted mattes
collection to choose from I literally do
not know which one I'm gonna go for
they're all so so beautiful so we've got
Queen B child star and sell out I think
looking at them sell out is definitely
my shade but I'll show you some swatches
right now of the other two so here
you've got child star and secondly Queen
B
but for this makeup look I'm going to
use a sellout this looks like the kind
of shape I'm going to absolutely be
obsessed with and if you saw my last new
in first impressions you'll know that I
used another shade covering but it was
cool but it's a beautiful coral color
and that lasted it's so well so
comfortable so I'm really looking
forward to wearing this one today really
easy to apply as well just using the
dopher applicator
straight onto the lips guys I think this
is my favorite lip product I've ever
ever put on my lips
this color hopefully you can see in the
camera is just absolutely stunning I
describe it as a very wearable brownie
pink it's almost it's almost pink with a
little bit of chocolate in there as well
it's just it's just so stunning and I
feel like it makes my teeth look whiter
as well consistency wise finished
applying it five seconds ago and it's
pretty much almost dry already and yet
it feels so comfortable so this is Too
Faced melted mattes and liquefied matte
long-wear lipstick in the shade sell out
guys I think this can potentially be a
big big favorite I absolutely love it
and the coral one that I tried last time
lasted so long so yeah really really
high hopes for this it's try it out a
little bit more now so it's completely
matte you could apply a balm over the
top if you want to but I think for today
I'm just gonna leave it I just love this
so much got really good feelings about
this I've got a feeling I'll be wearing
their some awful lot in upcoming video
by the way in my videos I always try and
link or whatever's on my face that I run
wearing in the description box so keep
an eye out for this one cuz I've got a
feeling it'll be quite a little regular
when it comes to what I'm wearing in
videos so I think to finish off this
makeup look I'm just gonna add a tiny
bit of blush because it's quite quite a
harsh look at the moment so I'm going to
make it a bit more fun
some blush and this isn't a new product
quite the opposite it's nice orgasm but
it is the new design with the what makes
you blush icon in there so I'm just
going to take my Sigma brush lightly Pat
it in and then apply to the apples of my
cheeks when someone told me the other
day that the whole smiling when you
apply blusher is actually just an old
wives tale and actually it's too high if
you do that
so recently I've not been smiling when
I've been applying my blush what I love
about NARS orgasm is it does have a
little bit of shimmer in there so you
don't need to apply highlighter
afterwards if you don't want to and this
is turning out to be quite a matte look
so I feel like highlighter could be a
bit of overkill and that's it the look
is now complete I feel like this is a
very mature and quite a glamorous look
with a dark smoky eye and the matte lip
still can't get over that lip I'm
literally obsessed cannot wait to wear
the other colors as well but let me know
what you guys think do you like this
look is it something that you will be
potentially trying out yourselves and
let me know if there any products in
here that I've really stood out for you
for me personally those two face
products are just incredible it's a
brand that I have obviously tried before

cruelty free as well that's just a huge
huge huge bonus and available
