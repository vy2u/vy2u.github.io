daily vlog here in Palli in case you
missed yesterday I'm here in Paris with
Birchbox for the launch of their new
Birchbox store which I think we're going
to go and check out today we walked past
it yesterday had a bit of a sneak peek
and this morning we've got a load of
free time so we are just going to go and
explore I think the girls and I are
going to hop in a taxi go to the Eiffel
Tower
get those all-important shots and find
somewhere really nice for lunch before I
do head out I'm going to show you a
quick outfit of the day in the mirror
because I'm wearing a couple of things I
bought in town yesterday it's always
nice to learn new things so this is yeah
the blouse that I bought in town
yesterday I should be able to find it
online so if I can find it I'll leave it
linked down below and but it's got this
beautiful stripe detail and then like
embroidery not really focusing is that
embroidery flowers which just gives it a
really nice effect and this ruffle
detail down the middle I've tucked it in
to my little white skirt with a pom-poms
on which I'm just loving at the moment
trying it really flattering and then
this little bag which is open annoyingly
I think it's such a good use - Chloe bag
I don't love the Chloe bag in house to
spend that crazy amount of money on it
but this one I think is just such a
lovely style and I think is about 25
euros but also retails 225 pounds so
again I'll leave a link to it down below
it's really spacious inside as well you
can just fit tons in there and then
finally my little Russell and bromley
shoes these are Stuart Weitzman the
pearls on them but speaking of dupes I
did actually find a 25-pound you to
these shoes so I will also leave that
linked down below because I know a lot
of you guys commented on how much you
love these shoes but I know they are
fairly pricey but I do love them for my
outfit of the day also to head out I put
on my faux suede jacket this is an
outfit full of dupes today so you guys
know how I've got the Reese jacket which
is in beautiful blush suede and I
absolutely love it I wear it so much but
then I saw this one in River Island
which is pretty much exactly the same
and about quarter of the price so I
really like this one for more everyday
wear it's actually really lovely and
soft because it's a faux suede but I'm
just a little bit obsessed with this
color and
where that for the first couple of hours
well it's a little bit chillier outside
and yeah so outing about flooring Paris
looking for that perfect photo
opportunity as bloggers sue and we think
we might have found the most perfect
Street for that eiffel parent background
shot just put our lives revolve around
fairly tragic but I did a video a couple
of months ago there was like the
Instagram guide to Paris and I was
trying to find this street but I didn't
quite find the one but fYI it's Rue de
leur University so we're going to try
and get some shots because look at this
amazing view
Oh
so Ellie and I are just risking life and
limb to get the perfect Instagram photo
honestly I don't even do a video all
about the behind-the-scenes of getting
the show on the things our bloggers do
because that wall there actually has
about a 50-foot snake not except I'm
really bad at Heights a big drop any
drops of sunglasses down Annie did they
survive in fact it's a positive so
modified expensive sunglasses like the
Nokia 3310 the best own money can buy to
feeling a little bit windswept after
walking through 50 weiner to the lovely
lunch add in lose em and now we have
come a few vertical stores so discuss
the time drawing straws
hi
we are in that the Birchbox dollar
anthem it really is these lovers
paradise the way that the store is
presented you've got all these different
areas for different product needs so
instead of going by brand you can go
sleep your eyes your lips of your skin
and then it seems like whether you want
hydration or mass etc etc and what I
also love is with the little themed
areas for example you've got a natural
beauty area a Korean and Asian skincare
area and then of course you've got the
French class Mexico five-dollar
quarterly and then at the back that will
pick a mixed section way to make your
inbox so it really is a beauty paradise
let's go down the river
you
we've just come upstairs about the
Birchbox store and it is this amazing
video that I can see behind me and here
is Julia who is a pretty checkered third
foot Bumble and Bumble is going to give
me a complete en hairstyle we're going
to go for some lovely suede and now I'm
gonna go meow my makeup done Ellie from
the shared moment and then what happened
then that we're going to take some snaps
in only
so I think the last time I vlogged was
when we're having a wine tasting at the
Birchbox studio as you can hotel by a
certain someone climbing up the sofa
behind me I'm back home with my two boys
so I currently PDA ings I love you well
so I'm back home reunited with Charlie
and the three little terrors the house
is looking rather fabulous it was nice
to come home and see that a lot to
change since when I left oh my god
Dexter come on animal is ridiculous and
but I will show you guys the house
properly in a house tour video which I
know has been promising for so long so I
do actually have a date in the diary
with cat to shoot that so house tour
video is coming soon and but you're
pretty going to see it in the background
of my vlogs anyway so yeah I've got the
Eurostar back from Paris we were
actually delayed a little bit because
there was a power cut in the tunnel so
no it was a barrel cut and tonight
Charlie and I are just going to go to
the pub across the road from us we
haven't been there since it has new
owners and it looks quite nice it's
coaching horses and apparently they do
sourdough pizza I'm hungry you don't I'm
so hungry
so let's go what I don't like being some
without prior agreement so why come on
little Terence
even back home again and Charlie is
giving you a strip show over highness so
you have nothing pizzas and hummus dip
at the pub across the road from where we
live so handy and nice to know that
somewhere super tasty right across the
road going to go to bed now have a
fairly early night I need to be quite
shattered from all the traveling and I
think Charlie's King from the early
night too because if it caps up by the
dogs barking while I've been away
so I will biggie you goodnight I hope
you enjoyed my second Paris vlog that is
more traveling coming up during everyday
May so stay tuned for that and I will
see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
