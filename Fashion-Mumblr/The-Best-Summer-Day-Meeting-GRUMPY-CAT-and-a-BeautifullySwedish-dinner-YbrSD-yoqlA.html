sausage how are you today
why you lookin so bashful roomie
good morning everybody
long time no vlog I feel like all of my
recent blogs have been travel-related so
it hasn't been as chatty this kind of me
talking to the camera types of logs I
thought I'd do a daily vlog today
because it's gonna be a really really
fun day I'll tell you focus issues there
we go
so yeah today's gonna be a really fun
day I'm dressed in my gym gear at the
moment because first of all I'm going
for an early morning workout class with
sweaty Betty and they've really kindly
kitted me out in their new I think it's
that autumn winter collection but let me
just show you what I'm wearing excuse
the mess in the background so first of
all these leggings so these have got
like a volcanic lava flow kind of print
on them the hashtag of the event is girl
on fire so I think maybe everybody at
the event is gonna be wearing these and
they're quite a nice thin material so
it's still super warm today so hopefully
I won't cry I'm wearing my Nike trainers
they're not sweaty Betty and then I'm
wearing this French Connection t-shirt
just to get that but they'd be better
you've also sent me this amazing gym top
have a look at this it's so cool so yeah
you can kind of see the amazing neckline
so that's the current outfit of the
morning luckily I've remembered to pack
an outfit for the rest of the day
because this outfit would not go down
well for the rest of the day and so I've
got a couple of meetings got lunch
meeting a coffee meeting and then
afternoon tea with Jo Malone which will
be absolutely lovely as you can imagine
then in the afternoon I'm going to meet
Grampy cat with Primark and we're going
to be having custom-made freak shakes
which are those like ridiculously
calorific milkshakes it's donuts know
that wonderful stuff but yeah grumpy cat
I actually saw him pick up when I was in
Texas and a couple of years ago but the
queue was just like around the block so
I just got tiny glimpse of him honestly
they thought Beyonce was in that
building the Lynx is that cute so yeah
meeting grumpy cat this afternoon
hopefully I hope it's not gonna be one
of those like there he is over in the
corner so we'll see and then I have a
really exciting dinner tonight with
record Lakeview cider company and it's
gonna be like a Swedish themed
six-course dinner with Swedish
entertainment and Charlie's coming
- that with me as well so gonna be a
really fun day I need to head out the
door so let's go just do the scene from
the kitchen got smoothies
I would like to interview somebody very
special Katie
so that was grumpy cat the cat that has
1.6 million Instagram followers
absolutely crazy reason why we're here
at subscribers has just launched a
nightmare range I think it's night what
when they're peddling pajamas loungewear
grumpy cats socks grumpy Hatmaker bags
so yeah that's pretty much like grumpy
cat is here see at the ceiling I didn't
love most of the day so it's just doing
meetings which you guys don't really
need to see but I'm going to hang out
with Katie here I'm gonna have some
milkshake and then we're going to go
really nice dude even nicer drink
granary square we made it finally
we're just looking around where the
event is and we just noticed this down
here that's where we're having now look
snazzy I can't say I've ever had
dinner on a barge broke before of you
we used to have fun buh-bye navigate his
barge experience later they were heading
down now to enjoy our Swedish evening
it's so perfect I've got Katie two
blondes
poor live the boat and we're being
typical bloggers and taking beautiful
photos of the cable so every really neat
very funny
so after the manic stress of trying to
get here on time is literally exactly
what we needed
mine is wildberry record lace either
with rum and berries on top I do
barbecues nests in the neck but either
cooked our you've ever made algorithm
well you can pretend you're cocktail
corn so and actually you just start
importantly provider in yeah and some
flowers what are they doing what is it
the story
we don't know it but it suited me so he
found our spots for the evening on the
edge of the boat enjoying what's left of
the sunshine having a few canapes my
Dark Arts which is Swedish delicacy
Katie's had some speeches and really
gets a lot progenitor mine
this is the Swedish boats so we're gonna
celebrate Swedish midsummer my name is
Noah chopped and swedish scandanavian
say
yeah I got you have any good singers
obviously the singing is improve the
more - where
Hey
though behind me the barbecue is in full
swing they've got the crayfish on the
barbecue and they're being cooked in
shops which have been found in the
Baltic Sea next cleaners
you tonight I've got a Swedish theme
have explained what's going on so
basically KP and I having dinner on the
boat down there and it's six good meals
obviously with garlic side of cocktails
which are pretty much the best thing I
have ever done and so easy to make it's
going to be my party chicken now and
just record labels six courses Swedish
food and everyone behind me is watching
because they're doing sweet dating it's
not to be dating sweet dating so going
back into the boat now full course
number three
Katie and I are just steps outside so a
little bit of a breeze
by the Bing so shall we we got one more
course go
there's a lot of courses that Swedish
people eat a lot and on to cocktail
number two which is passionfruit and
gems
these are honestly so nice after a hot
day of meeting and Katie's been in an
office all day this is what we needed we
finally torn ourselves away from the
midsummer songs which the name of the
boat that we were on did I say that
right I think but who knows I think it
means midsummer time which is like what
we were celebrating today Katie and I
were the last ones on the boat
so we're going to both head our separate
ways I'm going to go straight to bed and
we're having a barbecue that we come
from definitely recreating food
cocktails because so easy
I'm not sure if what we're doing tonight
is Boise tonight is lasting much longer
because different people have told us
different things so I'll leave the
information down below because it's such
a fun evening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
