channel I've got a little helper today
he's decided that he will not leave my
side while I film the intro although it
seems to be boring him quite a lot that
anyway today's video is a really really
exciting one because it's going to be my
first impressions kind of tutorial
although not ready because I've not used
them before of the estate edit so in
case you haven't heard the essay edit is
a new range of products from Estee
Lauder aimed at us Millennials so 18 to
25 year olds the social media generation
and quite appropriately the face of this
range is kendall Jenner who launched the
range in Selfridges a couple of evenings
ago so I have quite a selection of the
product to try for you the whole range
has I believe 82 products within it
which is a mixture of skincare a small
amount of skincare and a lots of beauty
products which have really been designed
with the needs of our generation in mind
I've got a small selection of that range
to try out for you and I'm going to be
using them for the very first time so
you're going to get my honest first
impressions what I think of them as I
apply them to my face for the first time
this is a finished look I'm filming the
intro after filming the tutorial so now
we're going to go back to my makeup
preface and get started so I have a few
options here as to what I could put on
my face first I've got the beam team
hydrate and below or the skin glowing
bomb flash illuminator or the poor
vanishing stick now as my skin is fairly
oily and glowy I'm going to go in with a
pore vanishing stick first and so this
is in a really gorgeous little silver
container not sure what that are correct
whether this is silver bullet with the
blue cobalt stripe around the top it's
kind of like a paint splatter which you
see all across all the packaging
including the outside packaging kind of
bringing that Estee Lauder blue
throughout the range but this is a pore
banishing stick hopefully it will just
do what it says on the tin and make my
paws blurred hopefully I'll have a bit
of a mattifying effect as well and it
looks like it's got a little bit of
maybe skincare in the middle it's got
this dot in the middle which makes me
think there's got some extra benefits
and that
so I'm going to swipe this over my
cheeks and on my chin which is where my
pores are most visible so immediately I
can see that it does have a mattifying
effect it's got rid of the shine from
that cheek so I'm just going to go ahead
and blur that over my other areas where
my pores are quite large I don't have
too bad pores on my forehead but because
it's mattifying I'm just gonna swipe it
down there as well
so that's given me a really nice
mattifying base to start the makeup and
next I'm going to use their skin glowing
bomb this is makeup with pink peony I
love pink peony I don't think I don't
ever use them in my makeup before
sometimes I do steer clear of glowing
products because as I said my skin is
fairly oily but because I've used that
mattifying and pore minimizing mistake I
think that's okay packaging on this is
really sleek and simple you've just got
this last I want to say canister but
maybe that's not the right word again
and I really love this hand written este
edit down there and then you've got a
pump style so let's see probably have to
give it a few pumps this might actually
be a little bit too pale for me so I'm
gonna have to blow this up a little bit
I don't have I don't think I have any
bronzer from the range and so maybe I'll
just add some of my own I'm just using
my fingers to apply this onto my cheeks
I'm not going in with too much product
at the moment so I'm not sure how much
you need and then I'm going to use a new
Clinique makeup brush just to blend this
in starting on the chin actually the
colors blended quite well surprisingly I
thought it'd be too pale but that seems
to have blended for my natural skin
color quite easily
coverage on first impressions it's not
too heavy I would probably compare this
like a BB cream and but it's blending
very very easily and spread them very
well feels nice and moisturizing as well
which is really lovely I'm really
surprised how well this is blending in
with my skin color I honestly thought
having had this on the back of my hand
that it's going to be much too pale so
maybe it's one of these very clever
foundations actually adapts to your skin
color I think that's really important if
they are aiming it at the kind of like
early twenties generation because we're
all grown out of the stage of having
foundation marks and tide lines nobody
wants to have different color skin on
their face to their neck so it's really
nice that they've got that really
adaptable shade range okay so I think
that's fully blended now it's given a
really beautiful girl hopefully the
camera is picking it up I am using
natural lighting to give you as true as
true a picture as possible but I think
in the mirror it has given a lovely glow
but without being too shiny I probably
would later on in the day depending on
how this lasts add a bit of powder to my
cheeks but for now I'm actually really
pleased with the finish of this and
that's coming from someone who normally
does not go for glowy makeup because of
my oily skin really like how this is
blended it looks really really healthy
so you have really good first
impressions of this foundation I've just
seen that I do have a flash photo powder
in my little este edit collection oh by
the way I read earlier that is called
the S Day at it because that's what
Estee Lauder's blog was called so I
thought that was quite a cool little
snippet that obviously really in tune
with the whole bloggers generation and
that's a really nice little fact so this
here as I said is the flash photo powder
I think Kendall I read or I watched her
interview with Fleur de force so this is
one of her favorites so this should be
quite a nice one for applying if you're
taking lots of photos good for in the
summer if you don't want to like shake
up your makeup but you need to not be
shiny for those flash bulbs if you're
going for any weddings or any special
occasions so I'm just using a fan brush
to apply this because I find that's what
applies these kind of products a lot
more lightly and again just going in on
those area
where my makeup meet setting like my
chin and by the way as you can probably
see it's a blue color so that's really
good at neutralizing and any redness on
your skin I think actually it's normally
green that neutralizes but it seems to
be doing a good job anyway I have a bit
of redness on my cheeks and this seems
to have made it more neutral weirdly the
foundation is getting more sitting quite
thick above my lip I'm not sure if it's
because I didn't blend it properly but
just a small note it does seem to have
kind of settled there a little bit so
I'm just gonna blend that in a teeny bit
wrong
next because I do not feel human without
my brows done I'm going to use the Estee
edit more than brows this says define
line and shade and I've got the shade go
three light brown does look quite dark
and usually I don't like using anything
quite so thick assists on my brows so
I'm going to go into some really really
light strokes that hopefully I don't get
too much of a bold brow from this that
is really surprising how fine I'm able
to get these strokes I think I need to
invest in a sharpener that's the right
size for this because as it is now it's
able to produce really lovely light
strokes who looks a lot darker on camera
than it is in real life okay so as you
can see I now have very defined brows I
probably will pick up a slightly lighter
shader of this to see if I can get it
looking a little bit more natural that
whole process probably took less than a
minute so really good if you just want
to Wiz on some brows super super quickly
although I'd say probably not the best
product to use if like me you like to
really do really do if you like to
really draw in those fine individual
lash hairs I think if you have naturally
good brows and you just want a little
bit more intensity to them then this
would be really good but personally I
prefer a slightly more fine products
although having said that looking in the
mirror they do look really really good
so next I'm going to add a bit of shape
to my face I'm going to grab a bronzer
from like
election and then use the estate a tip
Russia keeping it all on brand I've
grabbed my Estee Lauder bronze goddess
bronzer this is just a very very easy to
love bronzer for summer and I'm just
gonna take that on my Sigma brush adds a
little bit of shape into my face and the
hollows of my cheeks guys have seen me
doing this a million times so I'm going
to in too much detail just the areas
that the Sun naturally catches I'm sure
that is a bronzer for the s day edit but
if I do get one of those I'll let you
know how I get on with it but for now
I'm just adding a color back into my
face with this one and here we have a
blusher called the barest blush and I've
got shade for Amber glow which I think
it's gonna be a really nice warming
color I really like the packaging of
this one you've got the silver stripe
packaging from before but this one's got
a white paint splat which is a little
bit more chic and then inside the
paint's Pat is replicated in the golden
shade on the blusher and then you've got
this beautiful kind of warm very brownie
pink shade which is my favorite blush
shade ever looks really lovely in autumn
as well as summer time and I'm going to
use my zoeva oh no this is my Sigma duo
fiber powder brush a 15 just to really
really lightly stroke this I can see
already that the gold is spreading
across my brush very very easily so I'm
just taking a tiny bits I'm not sure how
intense that says I'm going to apply
that to the apples of my cheeks that is
a very very strong color you do not need
to pick up anything on this blush
asshole and I can see immediately it's
giving me a bit of highlight as well
which is really beautiful so you can see
on this side I added far too much that
first time so literally just touch the
blush onto the blush it's it's very
highly pigmented and then on this side
where I've got a little bit less on the
blush blush I can't say crush and brush
got a little bit less on the brush on
this side and it's giving a really
lovely quite 8 flushed kind of look but
really really natural with that bit of
highlight as well I think actually I've
got too much so I'm going to use a
powder brush just to blend that in a
little
so next up I'm going to do my eyes and
I've got a couple of options for doing
my eyes today firstly I've got a couple
of these shadow sticks and these are the
kind of roll-ups Telos with a crayon of
eyeshadow within them I've got the shade
own line spiced and oh three gilt both
of which are absolutely beautiful shades
and hopefully they'll blend drink
beautifully as well and my second option
is this which is the estate edit a
shadow palette this one is specifically
the Kendall palette I'm not palette
palette I'm not sure of they're bringing
out ranges for other celebrities or
anything like that but this is the one
that's signed by kendall Jenner so
inside this little sheet says the
backlight transformers and I think these
two shades here you can use them at the
very beginning and it really helps to
brighten the shade of the eyeshadow that
you go for so you've got some neutral
shades in here a nice kind of pale
peachy shade some gold some even some
fried purples and some darker shades as
well seeing as we are going for quite a
glowing look I might as I'll continue
that on the eyes so I'm going to use
this golden shade as my base to see how
that affects the rest of the eyeshadow
and I'm just taking that on a really
fluffy blending brush so it's a very
shimmery eyeshadow but it's not giving
too much color and more just that
shimmer so be interesting to see how
this looks when the other eyeshadow is
applied over the top and I'm going to
intensify that color with this kind of
champagne shade up in the middle here so
this one has got a lot more color
pigment to it it's really giving my eyes
almost a pinky champagne color and I
really really love this one really nice
for summer evenings and it's got a very
subtle glow to it a nice subtle shimmer
I'm going to bring that quite high up on
to the brow bone because I want to apply
the shadow sticks onto the actual eyelid
I'm going to start with the darker
shadow stick and I'm basically going to
scribble this all over the eyelids for
really easy just like five second makeup
look annoyingly that first few seconds
has made the pencil break so it's no
longer as sharp as it was before so I'm
just gonna get rid of that excess bit
and try and be a little bit softer this
time it's not quite as buttery as other
shadow sticks I've tried in the past
it's more kind of sticking the product
on my lips I think I need to blend this
in with my finger before I go any
further I'm actually not too sure how I
feel about this is not blending quite as
nicely as other shadow sticks that I've
tried hopefully I'm applying it right it
just seems that with my finger it's kind
of being a little bit uneven on my
eyelid I'm not sure if you can see
there's quite a lot of color condensed
together in one area but where it has
blend evenly it's really beautiful so
I'm going to stick at it because I
really want this to be quite a sheer
color and more even that it is now okay
it seems to have set if the position
that it's in now from like a few
centimeters away it looks from really
really good it's just when I'm up close
I can see that it's not perfectly even
but the effect that it is given giving
from far away I really like so I'm going
to go ahead and do the other eye
hopefully I'll have learned from my
mistakes and blend this one in a little
bit more quickly so I'm really pleased
with how the second I came out I did
that much more quickly I didn't even
speed that bit off at all for you guys
that is just how quickly I applied it I
did it much more softly so that when I
applied it with the actual stick it went
on more smoothly and the color I feel
like it's not gonna be budging anywhere
because if it's dried that quickly on
this side I don't think there's going to
be any color transferring onto the lid
throughout the day so fingers crossed
alley little note along here how it did
last but I've got really good feelings
about this one I think if you prefer
shiny sparkly shades then the eyeshadow
kit is the best option but for me
personally because I do prefer them
slightly more subtle I think I'll be
using the shadow sticks a lot more
frequently as I said I've also got the
lighter shade which is the shadow stick
in oh three guilts and I'm going to use
this while it's nice and sharpen I think
a lot more gently this time says not to
break it I'm going to bring that in the
corner of my eyes and also underneath
which I find is really good for
brightening the whole eye area so this
has given a really lovely golden shimmer
underneath the eyes it's very subtle
though so nice for like more of an
everyday look but for this look I'm
going to give something a tiny bit more
dramatic and I'm going to use the este
Edit hi-low stylo and this has got a
highlight pencil in one and so I'm going
to try using this on the corner of my
eyes to see if it's a little bit more
dramatic for this look okay so the
chrome has had a much more intense color
payoff not sure the cameras picking it
up but now my eyes look really lovely
and glowy very fresh and much kind of
bolder and healthier especially in the
inner corner so if you're a fan of that
really bright I love and I definitely
recommend that the high/low stylo as I
said I have shade oh one light medium
and I used to highlight section just on
the inner corner and this is a product
I'm slightly scared to try because it's
so ginormous this is the blackest liner
is actually called that and it's this
really chunky felt tip pen liner
I've actually got new vile ashes on at
the moment so I haven't in Rome iron it
for quite a long time so I'm gonna be
really really delicate and draw this
along the lash line so carefully because
I don't want to be scrubbing away and
potentially risk my lashes falling off
so let's see how I get along with this
one surprisingly easy to create a really
fine line considering how chunky this
liner is hope you can see the difference
between one eye that's done and the one
either isn't I just applied the tiniest
very thinnest line to my lash line so I
really don't want to go too overboard of
this so I'm going to try and do the same
on this side
not the easiest to create Catholics
let's just say but when it comes to
lining actual lash line it's doing a
really good job I think I'm going to
leave it without the Catholics just cuz
I don't want to risk ruining it but
really really impressed with how that
went on so fine and I guess because it's
a chunky pencil you can create a much
bolder look but that's not really my
style so pleased I can actually use this
one next I'm gonna go in with the lips
I'm not going to put on any mascara I'm
not sure there isn't a scar in the range
I definitely don't have any but because
I've got the lashes on as I said I don't
feel the need to wear additional mascara
so I do have quite a selection for the
lips so let's have a look what we want
to use to start with so here's my
selection of lip products they all look
the same
pretty much Oh actually no they don't
yes they do
I can't decide that kind of like an
optical illusion so I've got three plain
silver ones which I think are the actual
lip colors I've got a blue ombre one um
this one is that so look this one is a
bright red color very nice for kind of
summer parties a very bold shade but not
what I'm going for today so I'm going to
leave that one that's the shade oh
mattified lipstick in number ten killing
it and then this one in the blue
packaging I'm really intrigued to see
what this is I don't know if it's going
to be a blue lipstick okay it's a bright
yellow lipstick and I think if I
remember correctly this is used to
brighten the shade that you are on top
so I'm going to try using this but first
I'm going to put on some lip liner I've
got a really beautiful new D shade very
kardashian-jenner style and this is the
barest contour lip crayon in the shade
in the flesh and it's a really handy
roller pencil so no annoying sharpening
I really love using lip liners with any
lip combination I just find that they
help your lips look a lot more perfected
so I'm gonna start by lining just
outside my natural lip line with this
one
I bet you probably can't even see that
because it's such a close match to my
natural lip color but it should help me
to create that more defined shape so
next time go in with that yellow
lipstick I have no idea if this is gonna
actually come out yellow I'm kind of
hoping it doesn't or if it's going to
more of a neutralizer for my lips but
let's see oh my god is the other it
reminds me of one of those ski lip balms
okay you definitely would not want to
leave the house just with this on it's a
very strange yellow shade I'm hoping it
is going to be really effective at
brightening my lipstick it's not gone on
terribly smoothly fairly fairly patchy
actually and patchy actually I have got
reasonably dry lips I'm not going to
hold it against it but I'm hoping that
it will have quite an impact on how my
lipstick looks so let's try adding a
lipstick over the top of this beautiful
look and I've got three shades to choose
from here and the first one is oh one
miss you which is a very beautiful kind
of coral peachy pink color and I feel
like this is going to be the one I'm
going to go for and I also have o to in
the flesh which is again a very brownie
pink very generous style lipstick and
then an even darker one which is over
for the fairest so bare so you've got a
really good range of neutrals this one I
feel like is a very beautiful fresh
spring kind of color so I'm going to go
ahead and apply this and now really like
how it's got such a point at the top
which means I can apply it really neatly
around my lip shape if round lipsticks
around I just find that they get a
little bit more messy so let's see how
this applies on top of the yellow at the
moment my lips look kind of like a
sunset ombre shade very strange okay so
I think the results of the yellow is
that it's made my lips a lot more
fluorescent I do like this color it's
almost kind of I've ether beach party
nudee orangey Coral although it's not
exactly the look that I was hoping for
today so I'm actually gonna go and wipe
this off and try it applying the
lipstick by itself and that'd be quite a
good way to compare but first I'll give
you a look
okay I'm back now and I have removed the
yellow lipstick and lipstick on top of
that and reapplied it and I have to say
I'd much prefer it without the yellow I
feel like it was just not sitting and
very comfortably on my lips it feels
much more moisturizing without having
the yellow underneath and the color is a
little bit more dull but I think the
lipstick that I chose and is a very
bright lipstick anyway so perhaps you
just don't need the yellow on that one
but I might try it with some of my
lipsticks and that I own already from
other brands and see how it autists the
color with that I feel like because I'm
quite bronzed and this color is just a
little bit too pale so I'm actually
going to remove this and start again
with one of the more nude shades so my
lips are completely bare now and I'm
going to go in again with a lip liner
and then I'm going to apply a more new
lipstick shade so this one is so much
better it's a really beautiful very
natural-looking lip color so if you like
to have something on your lips but you
don't want it to be too obvious then
this is a really nice one so I use the
shade oh - in the flesh and in the flesh
so I guess it's meant to look very very
natural and it's super hydrating as well
I'm really surprised how far me this
feels on my lips so it's one of those
that's really really comfortable as you
guys probably know I've got a brace
recently Naurang at the moment and but
when I'm wearing it I do crave really
comfortable lipsticks so this is gonna
be becoming a very regularly worn
lipstick I can tell so second attempt at
the estate edit lipsticks I'm much more
pleased with and that's actually
everything that I'm going to apply today
I'm not going to go overboard and slap
things on my face just for the fun of it
but definitely keep your eye on my
snapchat to see my first impressions off
the bits of bobs which I haven't shown
you in today's video overall really
