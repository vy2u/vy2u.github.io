so I asked you at the end of one of my
last videos if you thought they would be
fun if I did vote over and a lot of you
commented saying that it would be so
here we are don't really know the rules
of a lot really I don't really know the
rules of vlog Toba I guess I will
probably just upload a video not maybe
not every day but every other day or
I'll decide a uploading schedule and
I'll put it down below so how do I look
to see when I will be uploading so
today's video is just a vlog as you can
pretty tell by what's going on and I'm
just about to go to doggy daycare and
Dexter's gonna have his first session
with a trainer and a groomer actually we
already found that stand in Balham and
then I'm going to watch Charlie play
rugby it's the first time I've watched
him play this season and Dexter's gonna
come along as well we've got him a
little hoodie not sure I put it where is
it I think it's downstairs got it got
him a little hoodie which I'm gonna put
oh gee RFC on which is gonna be really
cute and then there'll be his little his
little rugby hoodie my outfit of the day
today it's very boring I'm just wearing
a new jumper which I got from monsoon
nice cozy grey jumper watch from
Caravelle not focusing but it's the same
one I've been wearing loads recently
booooo-whoo jeans and then I might wear
wellies depending on if Charlie thinks
it's gonna be muddy or not and I'm also
going to be wearing this new jacket
which I absolutely love
it's kind of like a wax jacket with this
really nice almost Titan print on it and
it's from Crewe absolutely love this so
this is the jacket on this is pretty
much where everybody wears when they go
and watch the rugby it's nice and warm
it's wind proof rain proof and this
one's got a really nice weight waist
belt as well which hands on up yet it
makes it quite flattering when it's on
so that's really nice and then some
glasses because it's actually sunny
outside these are my top shop ones I
think they're called the Sophie cat eyes
I really like these read them quite a
lot yeah so now I'm going to go and head
out and take Dexter to training this
little doggy
is 18 years old aren't you Bob you grab
for donkey Oh some cute new 18 in New
York okay I've had a blow-dry
you doing up there little boy what you
doing up there huh you're looking
naughty what have you done
so back home now after a really fun
afternoon watching Charlie play rugby
they've won I think it was about twenty
nine ten against a really good team of
their leaks they did pretty well it's
gonna put put you down so yeah I was a
really good game of rugby and now we're
back home all the boys were kissing
Dexter so much.you is really popular I
think they decided he's their lucky
mascot because they've won in such a
tough game so yeah Charlie not at home
now and it's the England versus Wales
Six Nations Six Nations World Cup I
don't know it's a really important
England versus Belle's match on now and
I'm gonna cook for Charlie I picked up
some truffle flavored risotto from Italy
some it cooked best with some white wine
sauce and asparagus and some chicken
wrapped in Parma ham it should be nice
so I will cook with you on the blog so
you can see my recipe and then we're
just gonna sit down and watch the rugby
for us evening no doubt I'll have loads
of help and you're going to help me no
hey guys it's Sunday morning and I'm
sorry I didn't finish the vlog properly
last night Charlie and I had our lovely
dinner which I don't think I even
explained what it was but it was a
really nice truffle risotto which got
from Italy which I cooked with white
wine and lots of lots of parmesan and
then I did chicken wrapped in Parma ham
with some kind of cheesy sauce green
beans so it sounds like it should have
been healthy batch it was just really
really tasty meal and then we did some
garlic bread as well so it was really
nice
we watched the England versus Wales Rock
for you at Sun last night but England
lost like right at the last minute or
the last like ten minutes so Charlie was
a little bit annoyed to say the least
at least they won their game yesterday
so that was that was good positive
overall and today it's Sunday morning
it's just been a typical Sunday morning
so far I normally get up at about 7
o'clock on the weekends a.m. I just
can't seem to get out the habit of
getting up early I don't really know
just so I'm not capable of having a lion
I think I'm one of these people that
when I'm up I'm like I need to be
productive and get stuff done so I
finished editing the vlog that went up
today I did the thumbnail and the tweet
so that's gone up and then I started
watched some of my favorite youtubers I
normally like to watch Susie from hell
October Alex I covered the Fleur de
force I really liked her new videos who
else in the fro these my favorite girls
so I just spent a good twenty five
minutes or probably more an hour
watching those and kissing my little boy
is currently attacking me attack attack
attack and then I made myself a nice cup
of tea I normally just have a no not the
booze I normally have just an English
breakfast tea but when I was in Italy we
had nettle diffusion detox tea I'm not
sure if that's right but it's basically
a nettle detox tea and we had them in
the spa at the hotel and I may or may
not have just dropped a few in my
handbag leaving and tonight
Becca and I are going to the premiere of
a film called the intern which I'm
really excited about and we're both
going to be filming get ready with me
videos here so I need to have a bit of a
tidy up so yeah I'm gonna get the shower
now do my hair and then nip down to
toddle to get my parcels and I'll show
you guys what I got in the mail today
so I started filming my get ready with
me as you can see I've got
facemask on it is when I don't try
before which is probably a bit risky
when I need my skin see really good
tonight
the L'Occitane rebalancing face mask
which apparently is enriched with
absorbent vegetal vegetal and mineral
powders top-rated skid of impurities and
tighten pores which sounds like what I
need tonight so while this dries I think
I'm gonna remove my horrible nail
varnish so that I can paint them when
I'm out the shower so I've put my camera
on a tripod to film my get ready with me
and I think I got a little bit of face
mask on it so give that a bit of a clean
down and I think I might clean some of
my makeup brushes as well well the mask
steps in
I'm just taking our little boy for a
walk
but daddy's carrying him at the moment
like being held quite a lot so every now
and then you have a little run and then
we let you run free w boy now we're
gonna just get some nice fresh bread
from the firm bakery on the high street
and then head back and make it
from back home now Charlie and I had a
really nice cooked breakfast which I'll
show to you child
avvocato on toast and I just had eggs
and bacon which was lovely then went
down to Dajjal and here is my post from
the past three or four days while I was
an issue so I thought I'd just show you
it
the lovely Becker is here now she's not
going to be able to the camera because
she's makeup free but she'll be
providing a running country off the
packages I'm sure so let's have a little
look what's inside
I've just taken my makeup off because
back and I are just about to start
filming I'll get ready with me videos
for tonight so I don't know if I
mentioned it already but we're going to
the premiere film the intern which
should be really good fun the beds at
the moment isn't collected at the bomb
site back and I both got our makeup all
on the bed so if you just grab it when
we're filming is the little set up you
can see what my knees have got our
lighting box then a camera I can just
sit back she's made for me all the
blending is happening right now I don't
see how just filming and then I'm doing
some handheld camera action as well and
when Beck's finishing her makeup and
it's my goal
he goes to a back home now Becker and I
have just got into our pajamas and we
have all the Chinese food
we literally ordered for too much we're
going to turn it down and got to take
life so we're going to dig in
we've got juicy crispy duck except rice
chicken chow mein
so you only get more loops so we're
gonna dig in now and obviously you guys
know I like this is the end of book 2
part 1 so see you can blow up to the
part two in a couple of days time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
