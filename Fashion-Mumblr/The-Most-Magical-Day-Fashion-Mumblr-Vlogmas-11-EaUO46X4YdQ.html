so just about to head out now to take
some outfit photos
I've got changed I thought I'd just show
you what I'm wearing
got Ray Ban sunglasses even though
it's gross outside this long juillet
which is the main thing that I went to
photograph is new from River Island I
really really like it it's got a very
soft fur bit here and belt and then my
polo neck really snugly is from
SuperDrive ASOS jeans telomer feet boots
and mulberry bag
I'll see you later okay so just got into
London and we're just currently scouting
for places to shoot some outfit photos
I'm wearing quite like a neutral colored
outfit so we picked this place you know
where we are but I quite like this grey
wall and lighting is not too bad and
with Gemma who's currently hobbling
around shoes on oh you're just see what
as fashion bloggers have to do on a
daily basis and yeah so gonna show you
some photos here and then I am gonna go
to another wreath making for us so yeah
should be fun
so how'd a really good shoot with Gemma
we just left let's go the train back
sweat is no green when a flower wreath
and lobster cars it's taken place it's
an apparently mystery I said yesterday
tells the Argan
last bananas really enjoyed see what we
are making stays
so the good news is we're not doing
REITs again like last night but we are
making in turanians so if you have
behind me over there you can see ones
that they made earlier new Peter style
and we've just been showing how to make
the trainee amount I know their minds
not very anywhere near as well as
Duncan's but yeah his looks really
lovely we've just chosen
I'm gonna going inside
so here is my final finished Iranian I
went for the little old Sparky cherub at
the top there secure
and then we've got gold and white kind
of forestry twigs on the back
fine
and then you can see food fragrances in
that a little bit two issues in the
corner so yeah pretty pleased of my
first terrain iam attempt so here our
final masterpieces this is Sabrina's
Isles dilation okay this is alleys and
he's got a little ball board and a cute
little bug are anguish and the same type
you miss me but in the box
as mine and then Sabrina's dangling
so Sabrina and Ellie went for the
Huracan lanterns and I've gone for the
pair really cute together home now I
wasn't actually planning on coming home
between the Turanian workshop and the
Clarence dinner but we actually finished
earlier than I thought we would and got
a couple of hours to kill so I thought
I'd come home also Sabrina said that it
was going to be a little bit more dressy
than I thought it was all I had with me
was you know my French Connection grey
dress which I wore like all the time in
vlog Toba and it's like a knit dress I
thought I'd wear something a little bit
nicer but you know what I really lack in
dresses so I might have to really wear
my French Connection one this one but I
will that I've worn that to a few events
already and I just don't like it enough
to wear it again tonight um so yeah
trying to think all the dresses I have
gosh so yeah gonna have a little cup of
coffee now just made myself a different
Nespresso today it's the roaster buyer
flavor which sounds quite nice it's an
acquittal capsule so hopefully I like it
and then I'm gonna take my makeup off
I've literally got about an hour to get
ready so should be quite chilled
yeah Tim makeup off find something to
wear and head out for dinner with
Clarence actually just opened up a
parcel which was delivered yesterday but
I didn't really like open up the actual
product which is inside and I thought
I'd show you because this is seriously
heute so the perfume company that I
actually just did the wreath making with
and sent me this a couple of days ago
and I thought like yeah amazing Jo and
super few but can you see this it's
actually got my initials engraved on the
lid I'm such a sucker
so anything engraved so woo okay so just
finished getting ready I decided to go
all out and go really smart instead of
and just kind of half-hearted as I said
I was restoring to think of what dress I
was gonna wear and I've gone for this
one I'll show you in the full-length
mirror in a second and it's actually
from when I used to work at least a
couple of years ago um and yeah I
already wanted that much actually I
think I wore it to a wedding in the
summer and and yeah it's quite dressy
but you know I'm sure it's bad
you overdressed an underdressed because
a corner which where we're going is
rather swanky so yeah that's the outfit
I used a load of shades from the new
Urban Decay Gwen Stefani palette on my
eyes and I really like them they're kind
of a very warm brownie rose gold shades
and yeah little bit different to my
usual look but really liking those an
hourglass bronzer Topshop Motel lip
crayon and Toby highlighter yeah quite
pleased with the look after like a 25
minute get ready period because I just
got held up doing emails and stuff but
let me show you the outfit in the mirror
anyway
okay the Lighting's not ideal but it's
Navy can't really see and kind of see
there it's black with navy lace over it
and I really like the shape of think for
my body frame I've got quite broad
shoulders narrow waist and not terribly
long legs I think this is quite
flattering shape for me it's called the
fit-and-flare and then at the back oh my
god I'm not gonna be else to do there
some way you can kind of see that it's
got like a an open back so yeah I really
like this I'm not sure and little
pockets I'm not sure if they still have
a memory so definitely won't still have
this one but yeah it's from Rhys and
then I'm wearing my misguided little
booties I didn't want to go in proper
heels I thought though just be a little
bit too much so gone for misguided boots
and I'm also going to be taking this
little gold clutch with me which is by a
designer called Anna Pugh and let me
just check that's correct yeah Anna Pugh
and yeah I just thought the gold would
go quite nicely with the gold of the
heels although I'm gonna take my big
mulberry Cecily bag to take everything
in because the camera and the house keys
on the phone don't all fit in this one
so yeah probably leave my big one in the
cloakroom so gonna head off now and I'll
see you guys when I get there
amazing how easily this year is we
really have no idea so what we thought
would make such tradition and we didn't
think a long ride one of those
traditional being much more car drives
around me
so we've just finished dinner and with
parents in the wonderful corner hotel
honestly the most incredibly delicious
meal I've ever had and in case you might
be able to hear a certain little
clip-clopping you might be able to guess
that we are now in a horse-drawn
carriage going for a little ride around
the fair and we have got our Clarence
lot chocolates and oh my gosh so magical
it keeps getting ready for spring
so I'm home now just got back and I
immediately put on these gorgeous
pajamas which the girls at Clarence gave
us our brand called Olivia Vaughn hull
and they're hundred percent silk I
honestly don't think I have ever worn
anything quite so luxurious and they
have my initials on them too for little
jf they're absolutely gorgeous tonight
has just been so much fun I never
thought when I started vlogging that I'd
get to do evenings like that a beautiful
dinner at the Connaught hotel and a
horse-drawn carriage through Mayfair
just such a magical evening so I'm
feeling like such a lucky girl right now
and so yeah I'm going to take my makeup
off and head to bed it's about half past
11:00 Charlie's not home yet so I'm
quite looking forward to having bed to
myself and snuggling up in my lovely new
jammies
so yeah you guys enjoyed welcomers day
11 and I'll see you tomorrow for vlogmas
day 12 which is the final giveaway so um
the best one so far so keeping the count
for that and yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
