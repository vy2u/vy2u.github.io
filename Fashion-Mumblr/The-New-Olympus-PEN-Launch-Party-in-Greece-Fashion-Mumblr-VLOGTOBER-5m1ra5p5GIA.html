the first well second day of log tale
but the first proper day because today
is actually the first day of October I
know you guys saw a video yesterday
that's because I just I wanted to get
one up on the first day of October so I
hope you enjoy my shopping trip
yesterday as you may know I am now in
Greece and yeah I thought I would vlog
today because oh I have to because it's
logged over it's gonna take me a little
bit of a while to probably get used to
vlogging again because I haven't done I
don't have actually done daily vlogging
since last December because I did like
vloggers and everyday many but they
weren't really daily vlogs they were
kind of I'm going to put a video up
every day um so yeah it's going to be
proper vlogging this month
she says optimistically so yeah today is
the first day of that and it's going to
be a really fun day a bit of a
background information why we're in
Greece it is the launch of the new
Olympus PEN camera I'm actually using
the new one to film this let me show you
the old one in case you do not know
watching Olympus PEN is and it's
basically these cameras you've probably
seen them all over your Instagram and if
you're a blogger then you will know what
the Olympus PEN is this is the old one
this is the EPL 7 and the EPL 8 I will
maybe insert a photo of it because I
don't know how to show you otherwise
and yeah so basically they've launched
new cameras and we're here out in Greece
to celebrate that launch and also to
discover all about the new camera so
really really exciting here on this trip
it's myself Anna Lee Anne Lee Bush I
leave all these girls in surround down
below Danielle Pisa
Lydia millon and Emma hill with a Brit
lot and then of course Julia and Jay who
are kind of Olympus visionary
ambassadors so it's really really nice
bunch of us gals here and there's also
there's actually 50 bloggers here from
all over the world so it's a quite
insane trip they've taken over the
entire Nikki Beach hotel which is
incredible and so far um what does it
say Saturday so firstly we spent a whole
day traveling literally whole day up at
4 a.m. three and a half hour flight
three and a half hour bus
Johnny and him finally got here and then
yesterday was quite a fun day we started
off with a late breakfast and then we
had some workshops so we learned I had a
workshop about the filming capabilities
on this camera and then we had a
workshop on Lightroom so how to edit
your photos and yeah then we had lunch
and then we went to a villa which was
most insane villain world basically it
was called a man's away tried to say
that in a good accent and lens oh and um
if you look on my Instagram by the time
this video goes up which week tomorrow
my Instagram before the photos from that
place and it is the most expensive place
to stay in Europe so you must imagine
how crazy this place was I think the
villa that we took photos in was 15,000
pounds a night I'm kind of him but who
has that much money that's insane that's
like a whole five trips to the Maldives
on one night I can't fathom it but this
place is incredible
so that was yesterday and then we had a
lovely dinner and then me Emma Lydia and
Danielle we stayed up until 3:00 a.m.
talking which is just insane but we're
just chatting and chatting and chatting
so I didn't get out there until 9:00
which for me is ridiculous like I get up
at 5:00 most mornings didn't work done
signing it up till 9:00 and I missed
breakfast so Anna Leigh the absolute
little darling that she is um brought me
a breakfast platter oh there we go
she'd actually been using it for an
Instagram flat lane she had it left over
her props so she currently brought it up
for me so I've just been nibbling on
that today I think we're literally just
going to chill out in the Sun for the
morning we don't have anything we have
to do until 2 o'clock and even then it's
not tiresome we're going on a boat trip
we're going to different islands and
just to shoot some photos it's going to
be fun day and we just quickly show you
my room is a bit of a tip somebody
living in here for two days so I have
this glorious big bed really really
really comfortable and I really like the
light detail on the wall that's just a
really cool like detail and there's my
breakfast my camera my laptop some
makeup I was actually filming a makeup
kind of beach get ready with me so I've
got my
on the tripod looks like I'm filming
something dodgy having I'm here so yeah
that's coming soon and then we've got
the bathtub over here which is kind of
like in the middle of the room which is
just crazy so I could have a butt off
and we chatting someone in the bed so
yeah that's pretty cool we've got all
these big cupboards on this side a nice
little rug over there massive TV
I'll show you outside in a second and
and then we've got the bathroom again
I'm so sorry for the mess did not
prepare for this video pen party grease
written up on the wall and by the way
I'm obsessed with this bikini I've been
really struggling to find one I actually
find flattering at the moment just
because you know mac and cheese is
sneaking back into my life but I think
this one is fairly flat rings it's like
it's high-waisted you can see the good
part of my stomach which is like this
bit this bit is all covered I'm really
flat chested so this style is good for
me so it doesn't really focus on the
cleavage it just creates quite a
feminine body shape and it was oh my god
I think he was like over 100 pounds it's
a brand called Marysia
and hold on let me see what label this
is a brand I basically saw it on some
silly Jules Instagram and I was like I
need that so I thought I would invest in
a lovely bikini and yeah he was 150 I
don't know I'll leave a link down below
so yeah that's the bathroom which is
just beautiful I didn't show you the
shower but it's just a shower just a
very nice big powerful one so yeah I
think we're pretty much caught up I am
now going to finish eating my breakfast
and then I'm going to get on sunshine
because it's not actually that hot I
mean it gets up to about 26 degrees here
which is nice and warm but I feel like
it's on a layout in sunshine it's that
stays and I have emails to do or
anything and just relax and also I got
about four hours sleep so going to catch
up on my Z's so this is our little
outdoor pool area we are all a spritz in
a row all along here and we're currently
just having
there's naptime enjoying the sunshine
after our late wild night last night and
can can melt until three o'clock in the
morning and let me show you the view
from this side as well so we are right
by the beach no jetty shipwreck River
you
you
Oh
just come inside from our sunbathing
session we fan out there relaxing for
maybe a couple of hours you're like I'm
maybe picture a bit of color just very
exciting me to get my autumn tan on and
we're going to head down to lunch now
just having lunch in the hotel and then
we're going to go on our boat trip so I
need to put some clothes on
I packed awfully for this trip like you
actually didn't pack anything
appropriate I bought knitwear yeah
so every single outfit is a struggle so
let's see what I can pull together
okay so I've popped on my only weather
appropriate outfit this is the only
thing that I brought with me which isn't
like jeans and a jumper or something
doesn't go together so I'm pretty much
been - the whole trip and it is this
little place suit which I picked up in
the club monaco sale let me know in the
comments if you spotted my haul on snap
Jax I tried this on my snapchat and I
was asking for you guys opinions so yeah
let me know if he spotted that and then
these sunglasses they are product from
sunglass hut oh look this is a new
camera by the way I was looking show you
in the mirror so I went with a brown one
they've also got black and white and yes
lightly different started a new one but
fairly similar so I'll show you this in
more detail later and then I've got my
Tory Burch sandals which I picked up
from their sale a little while ago some
quite designer today unintentionally
see err quick lunch and then we're
heading out for the boat trip so let's
go
so we have come to another Island now
and actually we're on the same island
but a different corner of it and we're
just having a little look around
scouting for a location to shoot some
photos we're pretty much doing like a
tour of different parts the island
finding nice places to shoot so see we
were trying out the new camera and yeah
I think we all kind of want some natural
rock into the water type places to shoot
some bikinis doesn't want to shoot the
one I'm wearing on my place suit this
one here so yeah I'm gonna wander around
and fun spot
hello again few hours later and yeah I'm
sorry I didn't vlog too much on the boat
it would have been too windy for you to
hear me anyway
so we went to a couple of different
spots on island nearby I remember the
name of it ski something-or-other
and that really beautiful island and we
took lots of lovely photos and then as
we were coming back it's just most
beautiful lighting the Sun kind of
almost starting to set over the water
which is really beautiful the lighting
just everywhere the moment is absolutely
stunning it's definitely golden hour
which is lasting for about three hours
it's some about quarter to seven now and
we've got a pool party at half past
eight but surprise I just need to chill
before I start getting ready so I'm
gonna run myself a bath the ginormous
in-room bathtub umm maybe stick a
youtube video on and just chill out for
a little bit
Oh
me again so I've now got ready for word
dinner I'm had really nice fella certain
if you can tell but I'm just absolutely
shattered all the girls and I are just
completely zombified tonight um yeah so
I don't think they're going to be
partying too wild but we've been told to
dress in the same colors as our camera
tonight but I don't really own anything
brown so bumper white with gold details
because my camera has gone to details so
I'll just quickly show you what I'm
wearing so the dress is just quite plain
and simple it's got this chain detail on
the sleeves and then a nice little
ruffle effect there I've got my lovely
new Valentino bag and also Valentino
heels as well haven't really made too
much effort with my hair or makeup just
left it pretty simple just because I'm
so tired I can't go anymore
hey guys so I'm back in the room now I
didn't vlog as a lot of evening I'm so
sorry I am definitely going to get
better at this whole vlogging thing for
the rest of locked over because I know
it's not been good enough today but it
was the Olympus PEN party tonight so
they all got dressed up in the colour
according to our camera I think I
explained that earlier um so yeah
everybody was downstairs we took a group
photo and had some nice drinks and then
we had a lovely I think was like a five
course dinner here at the Nikki Beach
hotels that was really nice and I think
one of us are heading upstairs now for
an early night and yeah I'm gonna edit
this vlog now tomorrow we are pretty
much in transit all day we have to leave
the hotel at and we have to leave at 8
o'clock our bus leaves at 8 so we are
going to be travelling them for 3 hours
to get to the airport and the 3-hour
flight home so I think I will give
logging it tomorrow a mess because it's
yeah it's gonna be a lot of bus journeys
which is not going to be terribly
exciting so I think the next time I vlog
will be on Monday so hope you don't mind
waiting until Tuesday to see that
