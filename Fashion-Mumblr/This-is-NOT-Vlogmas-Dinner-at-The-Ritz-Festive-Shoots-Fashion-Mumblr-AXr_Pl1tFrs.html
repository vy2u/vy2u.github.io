shoots but it was very successful I shot
the exciting video that you guys will be

I thought I'd make the most of having a
fairly good hair day I had a blow-dry
yesterday for the Radley press day at
Drive I and I always find my blow dries
on day to look a million times better
than they do on day one so yes it's very
happy to

I have quite a lot of flowers to prepare

I'm feeling very spoiled and now I'm
just gonna make them look beautiful but
I am going to make this a two day vlog
so I will see you bright and early
tomorrow morning for gem session yay
so as you saw today started with a luffy
gym session I had Adam to myself this
morning usually Charlie and I share him
and but today was just me so we did a
lot of glutes and lower body exercises
which was really really good Adam has
also decided that he's going to do
something really fun Adam is our
personal trainer um on his Instagram
he's going to be doing 24 days of
fitness like an advent calendar for
fitness so I'm gonna leave Adams
Instagram down below because I think
it's been really fun and we notice if
you follow him and do his exercises if
you want to get fit in the lead-up to
Christmas I will definitely be doing
them all every single day so yeah made
my way home and it is a glorious day and
the sun is shining and the lighting in
the house is really nice so I'm going to
take that opportunity to film a couple
of videos I as I think I mentioned
Charlie and I are going away on an
actual holiday not a work trip going
away for twelve days so I want to pre
film lots of content so that my youtube
channel isn't just totally silent while
I'm away so I need to do a little bit of
pre filming I also just unbox a little
bit of blog mail and tried out a new
lipstick and I'm a big fan I've got it
on now as you know I'm a big fan of
nudes and this is the brand new Dick's
it's their magnetic matte lip color in
the shade go-girl and it's a crayon so
it looks like this so really easy to
apply I need to make sure I find a
sharpener that fits it um but yeah I
think it's just the most stunning color
it is a nude but quite like Coralie
pinky as well but yes that's what I'm
wearing on the lips so I'm gonna do a
little bit of emails and then start
filming excuse me little heed you can
now get your boys going to be helping
mommy today are you helping mommy today
so I just had a delivery from the Juicy
Couture and I thought I would show you
what is inside because it looks rather
exciting I think I'm gonna have a lot of
help from my two handsome little boys as
well okay so we have this pink fluffy
stocking which oh my goodness matches my
jumper so much pink right now do you
like that you Dickie I don't know if you
can see him but he's quite um tree
don't you my handsome friends yes I
would like to sleep in that stocking
mummy in fact you would fit right here
shred stockings you would fit inside
here but she's talking anyway let's see
what's inside here we have Viva La Juicy
clase and these fragrances are so
underrated they smell so good for so
long and I feel like they don't smell
how you'd expect a juicer to juice
accord to see a new agency don't exactly
you know it smell how you'd expect a
Juicy Couture fragrance to smell because
I do kind of think a juice creature is
quite a young brand but and I don't
think of myself as young but this I love
and my friends was really surprised when
they're like what are you wearing and
I'm like a Juicy Couture and it's
amazing so slight round by the side that
is adorable
what do you think my boys they're
transfixed by it what do you think let's
have a little a little spritz are you
using my hounds the boys approved that
is gorgeous what I find with these
fragrances is they're very quite sweet
at the beginning but then as you wear
them they mellow out and they're quite
like warming and aoudi so big fan of
those that was the first thing in my
stocking what is next I think this is
chocolate oh it's not chocolate it is a
Juicy Couture perfume gift set that's
pretty cool it's got lots of their
different Viva La Juicy fragrances in
their could sure Rose a noir oh I didn't
know about Noir
very nice nice little stocking filler
literally and then we have excuse me
young man what looks like a pair of
Juicy Couture tracted bottoms which is
amazing they don't have juicy written on
the bottom which I think it's good
because I'm too old for that but perfect
timing with our long haul flight next
week yes very very very generous regal
tract Villa Zuma pant very nice very
nice very cozy
wow what a lucky lady am I and then we
have oh sure I never know how to say
this char Bernal a walker they're really
cute pink chocolates Oh pink mark two
champagne truffles on my good
I think that is everyone know we have
one more thing in here I think it might
be the matching track atop oh my god
that is epic
oh and it's personalized Charlotte oh my
goodness
ha oh my god okay I don't know if this
is jafer Juicy Couture but it has a J on
the zip Josie that is amazing it's very
hairy at the moment from the inside of
the bag but luckily we've got a lot of
lint rollers what do you think my little
Dickie Dickie approves that is a very
very generous blogger mail from Juicy
Couture and the pink stocking as well
I'm a lucky lady so thank you to sketch
your girl is if you are watching so I'm
about to start filming and this is the
behind-the-scenes what you guys see is
this nice little neat area here what you
don't see is the rest of the room which
is always a bomb site because I have so
many clothes lying around that need to
be sorted but very excitingly it has
just started snowing you won't be able
to see probably tiny tiny little flecks
of snow which means when I go on my
Twitter every single person is going to
be talking about how it's snowing in
London it definitely won't settle I
don't think it's quite cold enough but
there we go
first snow of the year for the first day
of vlogging us right so I've just
finished filming one video got to the
end looked in the mirror and realized I
have eyeliner on one eye but not the
other so that's gonna look really really
silly I'm not gonna refilm it though I'm
really happy with how I went but if you
notice then leave me a comment yeah it's
feeling like a bit of at work doing that
so I'm going to apply eyeliner to this
eye and then fill my second video of the
day because I'm on a roll
thank goodness for good lighting so it's
been a couple of hours or quite a few
hours since I last vlog but you haven't
missed too much I filmed two videos this
afternoon and then I filmed my vlogmas
giveaway 12 days of vlogmas
giveaway videos so i mentioned earlier
on yesterday when I was at the Starbucks
pop-up that
I'm doing 12 days of vlogmas giveaways
and for each of these giveaways I've
done them in quite an unusual way I've
not seen anyone else running giveaways
like this but basically you need to be
following me on Twitter and Instagram
and hopefully have liked my fashion
mobile of Facebook page because on one
of those places each day of the first 12
days starting from today so one will
already be up there somewhere
there's gonna be a hidden link to a
video so that video might be like a
swipe up on an Instagram story or it
might be within a tweet or it might be
within a Facebook post and then once you
find that video that will take you
without and then once you find that
video in that video I'm gonna be letting
you know how to find a secret answer and
then when you find that secret answer
you leave it within a link that's in the
video description box and you can win a
prize and the prizes are absolutely
amazing ranging from like Beauty gift
sets I've got a designer handbag in
there as well and then you'll only find
out what the prizes are by watching the
secret video so yeah very very exciting
so make sure you're following me on all
of those channels so that you don't miss
any of the prizes because I really
wanted to do these giveaways as a bit of
a thank you a way of saying thank you
for your support this year and it's been
an incredible year for my channel growth
this time last year I hadn't hit a
hundred thousand subscribers yeah I
think we're on about 60,000 this time
last year and now to be over 200,000 is
quite mind-blowing certainly far more
incredible than I ever thought would
happen on this little old YouTube
channel so I wanted to say thank you and
spoil you guys as much as much as
possible obviously I'd love to give away
something to everybody but that's
suddenly not logistically possible but
this is this is my little way of saying
thank you so I hope you will take part
in the giveaways so for me this
afternoon we have to spend filming some
get ready with me clips before a
collaboration I'm doing with bare
minerals so I just did this makeup look
