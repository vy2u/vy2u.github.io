channel I hope you're all really well
and they're having a fabulous day today
in today's video I wanted to share with
you a few fashion and beauty tips all
revolving around saving our valuable
time so I've been working with Scottish
Widows who have been exploring the
concept of time how we use it and how we
waste it and they've come up with some
really interesting findings one of which
is that us Brits spend an average of 18
minutes a day on self-inflicted tasks
that we even admit are a waste of our
own time so that can be things like
watching silly animal things on YouTube
or spending time browsing social media
things like that but on average these
time wasting activities build up to 21
days in the year and I don't know about
you guys but I absolutely hate the idea
of wasting time I like to be productive
all the time so for that reason today's
video is all about a few things that I
like to do and a few tips for saving our
valuable time so one of the top ways
that us Brits waste our time is deciding
what to wear so I'm going to start off
by sharing with you a few of my fashion
tips which hopefully will save you a
little bit of time there campaign is all
about the power of just one hour and I
don't know about you but I often only
leave myself an hour in the mornings to
get myself ready that's deciding what
we're feeding myself washing and of
course preparing my outfit and my makeup
for the day and 46 percent of us Brits
waste time by deciding on what to wear
and therefore my first tip for saving a
little bit of time in the mornings is
deciding what you're going to wear the
night before now this is a really
important thing to do because not only
are we often a little bit clearer in the
head the night before but by taking our
clothes out the Wardrobe spending a few
moments just perhaps laying them out on
the bed and getting your outfit ready
that means that you have one less
decision to make in the morning I don't
know about you but I make decisions a
lot better slightly later on in the day
than I do first thing in the morning so
this means you're a lot more likely to
choose something you're going to end up
looking and feeling really good in the
next day the fewer decisions that you
have to make in the morning also leads
to a slightly clearer head later in the
day the less decisions as soon as you
wake up the better so that's
the reason why choosing outfit the night
before is a really really good idea this
is something that I do regularly if I
know that I'm going to be rushing in the
morning
I used to do it all the time when I had
a normal job
I don't do it quite so much anymore
because my mornings are a little bit
less stressed but if you do often find
yourself rushing in the mornings then
try it out it's a really simple and very
quick thing to change in your routine
and I'm sure you'll find that it makes a
lot of difference
my second time-saving trick would be to
make sure that you have a few go-to
outfits in your wardrobe that you can
just rely on when you are in a rush and
you can't decide what to wear if you
have three things in your wardrobe three
outfits that you know you look good in
and you feel good in then it just makes
your life so much easier what I would
suggest is to spend a little bit of time
perhaps one weekend putting together two
or three outfits that you know look good
all the time no matter what the weather
or the circumstance put yourself in
these outfits and take a photo on your
phone as inspiration you don't have to
do this all in one go perhaps one day if
you find oh I really like what I'm
wearing today just take a quick snap on
your phone and you can always refer to
that on those mornings when you are in a
little bit of a rush I also use this
trick when I'm traveling when I going on
holiday I take photos of my outfit so
that when I am abroad I don't need to
waste precious sunbathing or exploring
times in the morning by choosing an
outfit because I can just flick through
my camera roll and all my outfit of the
days are lined up in front of me so I
wanted to share with you three of my
personal favorite go-to outfits that
I've been wearing a lot recently and I'm
going to start with the most casual so
as I mentioned I do work from home so a
lot of my outfit of the days can afford
to be a bit casual and the number one
item of course is a classic pair of
jeans at the moment I'm really loving
Hollister jeans they are incredibly
comfortable they're very affordable and
yet they look very very high-end this is
a current favorite pair they're a dark
wash denim just a few very small rips
you've probably already seen me wearing
these all over Instagram and in vlogs
etc but there are really classic design
and I do feel that they look a lot more
high-end when I wear them
so this is one of my first classic
wardrobe essentials something that I can
reach for on a day-to-day basis I know
that they can be dressed up and dressed
down but something that I know that I
look and feel great in this time of year
I really like to pair them with a chunky
knit jumper this is one that I got the
other day from Topshop I really like the
chevron print it's very cozy and warm so
I can guarantee that I'm going to be
comfortable in it but it also looks very
chic as well the design just somehow
looks more high-end than Topshop it
could definitely be an immediate Pucci
or something along those lines no one
would tell that it was Topshop if you
didn't let them know and that also
brings me on it to another tip which
I'll go into a little bit more later but
accessories I find that if your outfit
is high-street and yet your accessories
are a little bit more well-thought-out
potentially even investment pieces or
designer then that really helps to
elevate an outfit so wearing something
like this perhaps with a crossbody bag
that's a little bit more statement or
instantly elevate your look and it means
you can just throw on something really
comfortable in the mornings and know
that you've got your outfit sorted for
the day for a look this as casual is
that one I'd recommend some standout
accessories whether that's your bag or
your shoes I picked up these from
glamorous at Avis recently and I think
they are so fun it's getting towards the
end of the time I'll be able to wear
them actually it's my feet potentially
you could get a little bit cold as they
are so open but then I might start to
wear these with black tights so actually
I take that back
but yeah these are a beautiful nude
color so very leg lengthening and I find
they go with a variety of outfits and
they do elevate a pair of jeans and
comfy jumper look so by having a few key
pieces like this in your wardrobe it
will make your outfit planning so much
quicker and simpler and you'll feel much
better in your outfit my next go-to
outfit and something that I recommend
for everyone to have in their wardrobe
is one simple day dress this is one from
phase 8 as you can see it's black at the
top and then it's got this camel colored
skirt going down to just below knee
length so very elegant and feminine
design it comes with a belt but you
could also switch in your own belt if
you wanted to change up the outfit but
this look really is a no-brainer you
don't need to mix and match anything
this dress is a one outfit solution just
add some dark tights and winter some
boots or some heels depending on the
occasion and instantly have a smart
ladylike and professional outfit so I'd
suggest it spend a little bit of time
online I'll list a few of my favorites
down below including this one and just a
dress you know you look fabulous in is
such an easy decision to make in the
morning finally another outfit and this
is something a little bit more trendy
but something I've been reaching for a
lot recently when I have a day of
meeting slightly smarter events to go to
and it is a jumpsuit with a long sleeve
ruffle top jumper underneath both of
these pieces are from Karen Millen and I
just adore them together when I tried
them out I was almost experimenting a
little bit but this is an example of
when I felt great in an outfit so I took
a photo on my phone and I've been
referring back to it so so many times
this piece I actually picked up in Abu
Dhabi I don't know if you saw it in my
come shopping with me vlog but I was
really attracted to the collar detail
because it's just a little bit unusual
it's still nice and warm I can wear a
thermal underneath it but it does look
truly fabulous underneath a jumpsuit and
really elevates the look for a winter
outfit of the day so those are my three
current go-to outfits on the day so I'm
in a rush I know they look great I know
I feel comfortable in them and I just
reached them time and time again it
saves me so much time with decision
making just by having those three go-to
outfits in my autumn wardrobe so as I
briefly touched on with accessories
another way to instantly make your
outfit so much more elevated and make
yourself feel a lot more put together is
with some fabulous accessories now as
you guys know I've been treating myself
to a few really beautiful handbags
recently but I am NOT saying you have to
go out there and spend a fortune on
handbags to make your outfit look put
together personally I do prefer to
invest in accessories rather than
clothing pieces as the seasons change
because I think it's a lot more
affordable to invest in accessories and
a whole new wardrobe and they really do
instantly transform your entire look so
my tip would be if you can to invest
like you more in the accessories rather
than your jumpers and your jeans because
your accessories tend to go with more
outfits you can get
lotmore price per wear out of them and
personally I find that just by putting
on a designer handbag or a premium high
street handbag it really makes me feel a
lot better about my entire outfit of the
day whether the rest of my outfit is
from Primark Topshop hmm it doesn't
matter when I have my favorite handbag
with me I just feel so so much better
about my entire outfit of the day so
there you have my morning fashion tips
on making the most of your hour of
getting ready in the morning sometimes
however we don't even have an hour to
completely finish our beauty routine so
next I want to go through a few tips on
really speeding up your beauty routine
in the morning now I know you guys have
heard me saying this a million times
before so I'm not going to go into too
much detail but cleansing the skin and
preparing the skin is so important for
how your makeup and your face looks for
the rest of the day so my first tip is
not to skip out on your cleansing and
preparation just using a really good
micelle of water I'm sure you guys know
my favorites by now if not I will link
my favorites video down below because
there is one featured in that but yeah
cleansing is really important my soul of
water almost acts as a double cleansing
routine especially in the mornings when
you don't have time to go into a fully
pampering skincare routine but always
always cleanse the face as thoroughly as
you have time to do and then don't skip
out on your serum and moisturizer
routine my second tip would be to get
yourself dressed while your moisturizer
sinks in I do find that no matter what
moisturizer I use my current darvon one
is really good for sinking in and having
my skin make it ready very quickly but I
would definitely recommend just putting
on your moisturizer after your skincare
routine and then getting yourself
dressed and ready to go while the
moisturizer sinks in just so your skin
is absolutely ready to go by the time
you yourself already if I have to leave
the house in 30 seconds I will put on a
little bit of tinted moisturizer pop in
a little bit of gel in my brows and then
a bold lipstick and then I feel pretty
much acceptable and ready to face the
world personally I don't really like
leaving the house with no makeup on
tinted moisturizer
and brows are my essentials but it's
completely up to you if you feel
comfortable leaving the house that
makeup on then that is absolutely
fantastic
personally I prefer not to even if I'm
counting down the seconds I will always
try to pop on a little bit of tinted
moisturizer brows and lipstick but what
I also recommend that is such an amazing
time saver is having a few of your
makeup essentials already put together
in a little makeup bag that you keep in
your handbag so this is mine this little
pink bag is from aromatherapy Associates
and in here I have a few essentials that
I know that even if I have left the
house with very minimal product on my
face this will pretty much tied me
through and get me through the day so
I'm going to briefly show you what's
inside firstly I have a base this is the
Estee Lauder CC cream I know I said I
don't leave the house without a base on
but sometimes I like to top it up a
little bit more and this is a very
natural healthy looking glowing product
and it's also containing the skin care
as well because it is a CC cream so it
kills a lot of birds with one stone also
on the base I have a teeny tiny bobbi
brown concealer this is so handy coz
it's so tiny
but can also hide any blemishes that I
haven't had time to cover before I leave
the house and then to set the base I
have my bare minerals bare Pro this
actually does work as a foundation so it
does have a bit more coverage and your
average powder but because it is a
powder product it does work to set that
base so it won't be going anywhere
during the day there's also a mirror and
a applicator sponge in there as well in
fact I'm just going to use a little bit
of this now because do look a tad shiny
in the viewfinder this is also a really
good one just for topping up and
freshening up your makeup during in the
day and then the next thing that I've
got in my everyday Hamburg makeup bag is
a very small eyeshadow palette this is
the sophisticate palette from Charlotte
Tilbury once again it's got a mirror in
the lid which just makes it really good
for applying on the go and these four
shades are incredibly where I bought
they're perfect for an everyday shade
you've got a light cream for
highlighting under the brow bone two
really lovely brown smokey eye shades
and then all
slightly darker one which is really fab
if you want to build up your look for
perhaps an evening if you're caught
unaware and you suddenly have some
drinks to go to it's really nice to just
add a little bit of intensity to your
eye look and hopefully in here I'm not
mistaken there should be an eyeshadow
brush okay there we go so I have a zoeva
oh no this is actually a sigma blending
brush and technically you shouldn't
really apply with a blending brush but I
just don't have the space for an entire
eye shadow brush collection in here so I
do just have the one brush and I find
that really good for just creating a
really natural eye look um also in here
I do have a mini mascara mascara is one
thing that I don't mind leaving the
house about especially if I've had an LV
eyelash lift and I had my lashes tinted
which I have done recently so I'm more
than happy to leave the house without
mascara but then if I do want to add a
little bit more intensity this is just a
mini of the benefit roller lash you
don't need colors with this it really
does add incredible curl and volume to
your lashes there's also a benefit gimme
brow since having my brows micro bladed
I don't feel the need to use pencil but
if you do then a pencil for the brows is
so tiny you might as well pop one in
here too but for me just using something
like this to really shape and set the
brows is really really handy and last
but not least I have a couple of
moisturizing lip products or a couple of
classic lip products this one is my
shantak eye that you guys know and I'm
obsessed with it is in the shade Mirage
it's a really barmy texture so it adds
the lip balm and a lip color all-in-one
so flattering I can just apply it on the
go without the need for a mirror but if
I do want a slightly more intense shade
and I've recently been loving the Rimmel
one and only matte I think it's called
in the shade 700 trendsetter and these
are shades to go with any outfit and
their shades I just really feel
comfortable in I know they really suit
me so all of those pieces are kept in my
handbag for those days when perhaps I
haven't had time to complete my full of
beauty routine at home so those are my
very simple tips for making the most of
the time that you have in the morning
whether that's an hour or a little bit
longer or even less those are things
that I like to do in order to maximize
my time not wait
anytime in the mornings because every
minute counts especially if you are
heading out for an important meeting or
heading out to the office to make sure
you get there on time it is so important
to make the most of every single second
so I really hope you guys have found
this video useful and let me know if you
already do any of these things any of
these tips or if you've got any time
