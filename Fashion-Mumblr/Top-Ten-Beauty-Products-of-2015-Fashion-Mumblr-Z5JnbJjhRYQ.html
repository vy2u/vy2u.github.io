products of 2015 you might have noticed
that I didn't do a December favorites
video and that's because I was here
there and everywhere June December and
pretty much not actually discovering any
new products so instead I thought I
would look back on all my favorites over
the past twelve months of the whole of
2015 and somehow try and pull together
my top ten to share with you guys
hopefully you might find it useful maybe
you have some of the same favorites as I
do or maybe you might discover a new
product so let's get started
2015 for me was really the year where my
blog kind of took over my life a little
bit so there were lots of Beauty
discoveries so as you can imagine
choosing just 10 was pretty hard and to
be honest I'm really really happy with
the 10 that I've chosen there are a few
little added extras in there some
honorary mentions let's just say but to
start with the top 10 my probably my
favorite Beauty discovery of 2015 no
surprise it's the Missal cleanse and
polish I'm pretty sure when I blogged
about this I was like guys I'm giving up
beauty blogging I don't need to review
or test any more cleansers because I
found the one and I still live by that I
don't really use many other cleansers
yes of course I try a few more maybe for
a couple of days of time I used the
Oscar and a Songz cleansing gel kind of
on special occasions and I want to
pamper myself but for all day everyday
not all day at the end of the day
obviously I am just obsessed with the
less I'll cleanse and polish it's worked
wonders my skin it's really helped to
regulate out my skin so no more waking
up with a dry skin day or an oily skin
day I just credit this to really making
me have a good skin day every day pretty
much I mean not that my skin is perfect
but I've really enjoyed using this it's
gentle you can use on your eyes it's
very thorough but still being incredibly
gentle and it's not a bad price it's
easy to get hold of just a winner and
I'm sure loads of beauty bloggers are
also obsessed with this in fact I know
they are but for me this really is a
standout cleansing product for 2015 and
I'll continue to use this for many
is to come I'm sure so this is my first
2015 favorite 2 PT product I'm gonna try
and do this in the order that I apply
them to my face so I didn't actually put
a primer or serum or moisturizer in my
favorites just because there are a few
that I loved and nothing really that Wow
for me to include my top 10 product so
the next thing had to get out my drawer
forgotten to collect it the next thing
that is in 9 2015 top 10 is the Rimmel
match perfection foundation this really
revolutionized my foundation it's become
very clearly my everyday go-to if I want
to go for an evening look this just
creates the most flawless finish if you
want an everyday look it's quick it's
easily blendable and I think the
standout time for me with this
foundation was one time when I went out
and for a girls night out with some of
my girlfriends and all of them just kept
commenting on how great my skin looked
and it made me feel so so great that
evening the photos were I just loved
those photos from that evening and my
skin just looked really incredible if I
do say so myself know it's all down to
this and that one day kind of got me
hooked on it now I just use it as an
everyday as I said a user in the
evenings and I want her a really
airbrush effect I'll buff on a few
layers of this and it's a drugstore
foundation honestly I have a few luxury
foundations in my makeup drawer
do you or hourglass you name it but I
reach this over those when I want a
really beautiful makeup look it's also
my foundation for filming the so if
you're a youtuber or a blogger and you
film yourself this is what I wear on my
skin and this is probably my fifth
bottle it's not that expensive it's
under 10 pounds so I'm quite happy to
just top up a few bottles of this it's
SPF 20 as well which is great and in
case you're wondering I use 202 soft
beige as a color there's a few versions
of this as one with a red lid which i
think is called the 25 hour foundation
that one I love as well and is also the
same thing from a brand called Manhattan
which i think is just a European version
of Rimmel and it's exactly the same so
if you're European and you have
Manhattan but not Rimmel then if it
looks like this then it's probably the
same one also the product which I used
to apply that foundation
also is in my 2015 top products and it's
this which is the Ziva 102 god I should
actually do this yes it's the mono tube
silk finish foundation brush before this
I was a little bit hit-and-miss I had a
Mac one the dual fiber and before that I
had one of those I'm not sure the
official name but ones that looked like
a paintbrush and never really got the
right effects the paintbrush one kind of
slapped it on and I tended to tended I
used to get those and tied lines and
they called and the paintbrush I just
found I could never really get much
consistency but this really
revolutionized the way that I put on my
foundation I got it within the set I
think it's a set of eight or maybe even
more than that it's pretty much just all
the brushes that you need absolutely
beautiful easily a bloggers favorite but
also I told all my friends to get them
and they absolutely love them the whole
set is full of really useful brushes
they do look gorgeous because of this
white tip on the top but yes it gets
dirty but yes it's also very very easy
to clean so don't let that put you off -
incredibly battered and just proves how
much I love it and how much I've used it
it's been in my travel bagg hundreds of
times it's been very well used but it's
still going strong and I think value for
money
the beauty of the product the
functionality of the product you can't
go wrong so I highly recommend Zuber
brushes 2015 has definitely been the
year of the zoeva brushes the pink set
with the rose gold top just absolutely
gorgeous I think I might treat myself to
the full set of got the I say at the
moment but yeah great investment blog a
favorite for good reason so a
well-deserved brush my top 10 peach
products of 2015 oh I kind of should
have mentioned this one with my skincare
at the very beginning but actually this
is something which I use in the evening
so I'll mention it now and it's the
dolphin revitalizing oil face body and
hair now I have to say I've only ever
used this on the face because it almost
seems too precious to use on the body
and the hair dolphin is one of my
favorite skin care brands when it comes
to the luxury of the product itself
their oils are just divine the products
they all just smell so heavenly and they
really do incredible things to your skin
this has made its way into my top 10
because
see the price for a dolphin oil and
dolphins really famed for just the
quality and magic of their oils this is
$29.99 I believe I will put something
over the screen now if it's wrong but I
believe this is $29.99 which is such a
good value you have how many mils you
have 50ml in here which is quite a lot
of oil and as you can see I'm only about
half way through but I have been using
this one or two sometimes three drops
pretty much every evening bar a few
evenings and I'm trying out something
else but it smells absolutely gorgeous
what I do is I've put a couple of pumps
of this into my hands rub my hands
together breathe it in inhale all those
gorgeous scents past my hands - Charlie
let him breathe it in and then I Pat it
on my face and it's just such a lovely
pampering addition to my evening routine
and as I do have quite oily skin this
really helps to rebalance the skin I
think we're all over the fact that you
shouldn't use oils on oily skin you
definitely can in fact it's really good
for balancing out oily skin so this has
been a product which I really really
love using in 2015 and when it runs out
I'll definitely be repurchasing this
super food for money absolutely love
this this next one is actually a
reasonably recent addition to my makeup
collection and I did think quite hard
about whether to add this in because I
did wonder whether it was just something
that I'm obsessed with right now but
honestly I do see myself using this in
spring in summer definitely in summer
because it does bring such a gorgeous
glow to the skin and it's my hourglass
ambient light bronzing powder so I've
got luminous bronze light and I'm really
pleased with it at the moment because
I'm not as turned as I like to be at the
moment so this just adds a really lovely
and if I do say so I think it looks
quite a healthy and natural looking tan
which is great for the winter I do tend
to go a little bit gray and winter time
maybe it's something about my diet but
also the fact that I need a holiday and
this really does just bring a little bit
of shape a bit of life and definitely a
healthy glow back into my skin I
definitely think I'll continue to use
this in the summertime because it does
have those ever-so-slightly shimmering
and particles which do give it that
lovely
so I think that I'll make it and
absolutely cool just put it to use in
summertime to be honest I fell in love
with the whole ambient lighting range I
got there I don't know what it's called
now the basics the first powder that
when I'm obsessed with weather just
called the ambient light powder I think
so and then I got blush which are very
nearly also made the cut into my top ten
and then I finally went ahead and got
the bronzer just the whole range don't
know how they do it they look gorgeous
and the products inside are really
really spectacular
so we'll be surprised to see this in
quite a few beauty bloggers top products
of 2015 because this really is a
stunning bronzer and it's someone that I
definitely reach for on an everyday
basis so the blusher that I chose in the
end was the Charlotte Tilbury cheek to
chic in the shade sex on fire this I
find as a really versatile blusher again
it's Charlotte Tilbury so I mean you
can't really go wrong with any shot till
with products it's probably one of my
standout brands for 2015 calm believe
I've never tried it before that in fact
it it launched in 2015 no surely not 7
2014 but this was my favorite Charlotte
till we put and my favorite blusher for
the year I found that I really love the
shade it's still a very girly pink but
this darker shade in the middle has
really meant that when it's got a little
bit cooler and I've wanted something
slightly warmer on my face it's given me
almost a purpley move kind of color to
my cheeks which I've absolutely loved
and has definitely become my everyday
blush it's incredibly good quality I
find it lasts a long time as I said I've
been using this everyday and it really
doesn't seem to affect it the quantity
that's in there so I'm hoping this is
going to stick around a lot longer yes
sure that Tilbury is not the cheapest
product to buy and they're definitely
not budget but I really think you get
your pay for especially with Charlotte
Tilbury I'm just impressed with
everything that this gal brings out and
have loved using this blusher the next
few products on my top ten are all eye
products starting with Urban Decay's
Naked 3 palette not sure when that the
Naked 3 came out I'm pretty sure it
wasn't 2015 but 2015 was the year that I
got my hands on it and I'd say for a
good six months solidly I would use this
every single morning the colors which
inside are just so perfect for me and
love Browns and
these kind of pinky Browns almost
rose-gold eCopy shades on my eyelids and
I especially loved using Munna and limit
for the all over the eyelid and then I
use liar buzz I'm looking at the ones
are really heavily dented and biscuits
so I just absolutely loved using this
palette I found all of the shades were
so wearable really really suit people
with my kind of colorations hair color
and skin color and eye color and yeah
you just cannot fault this I think again
these are super duper value for money
the brushes that come inside them unlike
many eyeshadow palettes are actually
really good quality and I use that every
time I use the Naked palette I think the
shadows themselves also really good
quality as I said I use them pretty much
every day I didn't ever struggle with
creasing or than it fell off or faded
throughout the day and I use them so
often and yet I still have not hit the
pan for any of these shades so even
though I use I think it was burnout I
think I've pre said biscuit last time so
I couldn't read it's as all and it's
unfitted away but I think I used burnout
as my everyday shade for at least six
months and it's still going strong
so yeah great value for money I think
either around the forty pound mark but
when you think of how many colors you
get and just how super they are highly
highly recommend this if you've not yet
tried it also on the eyes roller lash
was an incredible launch of 2015 from
benefit and it really did become my
go-to mascara for 2015 it lifts it
separates it curls the lashes I mean
what more do you want it's really lovely
formula sticks around for a long time
the packaging is really cute I know some
people say the benefit products have
loads of hype but I really do think that
this lived up to the hype yes there was
a lot of hype around when it launched
but I think is well deserve this really
is an incredible mascara there are drug
storm scars which I love as well but for
me I find myself reaching for this one
over and over again it's pink which of
course means that I love it and yeah
this is probably my third bottle the
wand on this is really great it's good
for separating and also building volume
honestly I don't have a bad word to say
about roller lash mascara so of all of
us gaara's in 2015 and of all the beauty
products this is in my top 10
definitely my favorite mascara of the
year and lastly on the eyes I really
have always struggled with my eyebrows I
know you guys putting boarded me saying
it but I really do and something which
really stood out for me this year was
the Anastasia Beverly Hills brow Wiz now
I was really really late to the
bandwagon with this I think I picked
this up maybe and around March time
something like that when I went to the
US I got this from Sephora I didn't ever
know where to buy it from in the UK but
this really did change my brow game I
did also purchase the Anastasia Beverly
Hills what's it called but one that
everyone's obsessed with oh that gel was
a called brow sculpt hours probably brow
wet smoothness as brower's you know the
one I mean the one in the pot sculpting
brow gel I don't know but you know what
I mean um but I never really got along
with that I'm still persisting because I
really do want to because I was quite
expensive but for me this was just
SuperDuper easy to use the color itself
I have the shade soft brown and I found
that to be a really good color match for
my brows I love the fact that it's a
really skinny pencil and although I have
used this a heck of a lot this still
seems to be quite a lot of pencil left
eye up so you hate it when you splash
out on a product like that and you find
that it only lasts a few weeks because
there's not actually that much product
inside but this one is still going
strong and there's a brush on the other
end mine is completely full of makeup
and I don't really know how to them how
to clean it but just a two in one
product absolutely super especially if
your brows are quite sparse I need to
fill them in as well as as winners as
well as shape them I just found that
this was quite revolutionary for my
brows in 2015 and again when this runs
out I'll be repurchasing even at the
moment I'm using Urban Decay brow betta
just to kind of pad this out a little
bit and they're very similar products
and Urban Decay is easier to pick up in
the UK but for me still this one just
picked it to the poster and finally this
is my last top 10 product for 2015
and I have to admit I'm not sure about
she's spoken about this on YouTube
before that maybe not even the blog
because it's one that kind of very
slowly crept its way into my beauty
routine and my everyday makeup bag and I
always used it it was my everyday lip
and it kind of became like my signature
lip color especially while I was working
and then I just thought allowed more
products and it kind of fell to the back
but basically long rambling intro aside
it's this which is the bite the lip
beauty mat creme lip crayon in this
shade amaretto it's the color that I'm
wearing now and I think it's such a
universally flattering shade no matter
what your skin tone no matter what your
natural lip color because this is a very
heavily pigmented product it's a creamy
almost crayon like lipstick so it's like
a lipstick not a lip balm although it
doesn't dry out the lips so I do have
naturally quite dry lips and I don't
find this to dry out my lips anymore
which is great and lasting power wise
you just cannot beat this I find that I
don't need to top up maybe once or twice
a day it really isn't going to be
long-lasting and I always used to get
compliments on my lip color when wearing
this but I feel like I didn't talk about
it that much on the blog or youtube
channel I think it was one that just I
just felt so familiar with it was almost
too much part of my routine that never
had its moments is really hard to
explain but as soon as but always
throughout the years like I must include
this and my end of your favorites kind
of always had that in my head because it
really is such a spectacular product now
I'm sorry to say I'm not sure where you
can buy this in the UK because I
actually got my first and second one
from Sephora and then when I wasn't
going to New York anymore I actually
asked my boss at work can you please
stock up on these I have about four of
these in my cupboard and I'm sure I'll
get through them they they do last a
long time because there's a lot of
products in there but with the fact that
I used this and topped up maybe three
times a day you can imagine I did get
through quite a few of these in 2015 and
so that is it they are my top ten at
beauty products of 2015 I think that
2015 for me was a really great year of
discovering new things but also really
finding out what worked for my skin what
worked for my colorings my complexion
and really was the year I felt really
comfortable with the products I was
using not so much chopping and changing
but more finding things that I loved and
really sticking to them so hope
you guys have found this really
interesting and I'd love to know if any
of these products were on your 2015 top
ten or even just your some of your
favorite beauty products of the year and

mentioned then please do let me know
