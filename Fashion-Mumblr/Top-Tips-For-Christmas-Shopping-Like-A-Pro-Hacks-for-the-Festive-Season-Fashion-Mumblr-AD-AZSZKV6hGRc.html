manic last-minute Christmas shopping
dread but I'm sure I'm not alone with a
mounting to-do list and I haven't even
started thinking about decorating the
house for the festive season yet but
today I'm going to share my top tips for
Christmas shopping from those failsafe
fabulous options - what to do if you've
left it to the very last minute here my
Christmas shopping hacks to have on hand
this festive season my first tip is
actually to not plan too much although
making a note on your phone of who you
need to buy for and a rough idea of what
to get always helps shop by yourself
you'll be able to get the job done much
more quickly without instructions and
you'll avoid the delays and confusions
when the ask someone else's opinion
a fail-safe gift for the person that's
impossible to buy for is a winter
accessory fortunately this is where
accessorize are a gifting or Wunderland
there's nothing more perfect than a
chunky knit scarf some soft gloves all
the classic gift a pair of socks you
often forget to buy them for yourself so
it's always a treat to find them under
the Christmas tree
without doubt gift-giving is one of my
favorite parts of Christmas but it can
be hard to find a gift that's personal
as well as practical I like to treat my
friends to gifts at their wear
throughout the festive season like a
sequined clutch bag or a pair of
dazzling earrings it's a win-win when
you can ease the party outfit panic and
take a gift off your Christmas shopping
list look for accessories or complement
the color palette that they usually opt
for
it sounds kind of obvious but doing a
little bit of research can save a lot of
stress often at this time of year your
favorite stores will have special offers
which definitely help to make gift
giving or treating yourself a little bit
more affordable accessorize are doing
lots of deals and perfect last-minute
christmas gifts so keep your eyes peeled
now this final tip will truly be a test
of your willpower but by looking at
pieces that you truly love trust your
instinct chances are your friends will
love them too
so those are my top five tips for
Christmas shopping like a pro now I know
you guys will be super keen to see what
I picked up so let me show you firstly
this Z for accessorized choker necklace
for my friend Tana she always manages to
find the best jewelry pieces for a glam
but edgy look and I know she'll adore
this for my niece a sparkling clutch bag
she's just at the age where she's
starting to go to Christmas parties and
I'm sure this will be the perfect
finishing touch to her evening looks for
charlie's sister who's revising for her
exams this daily planner i know how she
loves to keep organized and this will
look so adorable on her desk it was on
special offers I picked her up a couple
of other pieces too sure finally sparkly
horns hilarious and loves anything so so
so related so these socks are absolutely
perfect
Charlie has recently become obsessed
with Star Wars again and we're only
doing small stocking fillers this year
so I thought this stormtrooper keyring
was quite fun we also collect sausage
dog charms for our tree and how cute is
this dachshund wearing and Nutcracker
outfit I know Charlie will love it as
much as I do for my bestie Vicky a
selection of Z for accessorized jewelry
she loves pieces that look very luxe so
I've chosen a delicate selection of
pieces that I adore as well
my mum loves sparkles so these earrings
with Swarovski crystals would perfect
for her and I also picked up a matching
necklace
I couldn't resist shooting myself and I
totally fell in love with this crossbody
bag it's got a real designer feel to it
and the shape is so practical don't you
think is the perfect way to finish off
this outfit I hope you enjoyed my tips
on Christmas shopping like a pro and
