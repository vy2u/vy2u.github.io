joining me for today's video which is
going to be my top tips for starting
University we have just hit the month of
September and I'm sure that a lot of you
are either about to go back to school or
about to start unique for the first time
which is really really exciting as you
may or may not know I graduated a couple
of years ago from London College of
Fashion so I thought I would talk a
little bit about my personal uni
experience and also share some hopefully
words of wisdom if you are about to
start uni as well I do feel the need to
explain why I'm wearing a fuzzy lei I
know that it's only just September but
it is so cold in this house I don't know
what's going on I feel like last time I
filmed downstairs was my River Island
and Topshop Hall and I was absolutely
sweltering whereas now I am bloody
freezing so just excuse me while I sit
here in my Mongolian Father so I'll
start by telling you a little bit about
my personal University experience I
actually didn't really know what I
wanted to do when I left school which
I'm sure may be the case for a lot of
you guys I feel like it's very rare
someone to be in their final year of
school in the second year of sixth form
or even first year six when you have to
kind of decide and just know for sure
what you want to do I think I knew maybe
two people that were like oh I want to
be a lawyer or I want to be a doctor or
I want to be working in marketing well I
just didn't have a clue although to be
honest now that I look back at those
career workshops and I look at my
results actually they all have kind of
in some way come true so a lot of them
said I would either work in publishing
or in photography or in fashion and I
guess being a blogger is a combination
of those so yeah I would say pay
attention to your career workshops if
your school offers them but they're not
the be-all and end-all of everything
what my biggest tip would be if you're
deciding what subjects you want to do it
uni if in fact you do want to go to uni
it would be do a subject that you enjoy
you have to absolutely love a subject to
solidly study it for three years that's
a long time I think if you have any
doubts about a subject then potentially
think about it a little bit harder so
personally I knew that I loved
English I was always super clean with my
homework when it came to English lessons
at school I really enjoyed doing my
coursework and I thought maybe I wanted
to be a fashion journalist so my English
teacher told me to study English to
surprise surprise so I actually did that
I did my a-levels and I got the place at
Royal Holloway University which is in
Surrey and it's about 40 minutes from
London I fell in love with the
University the building is stunning and
I love the idea of things so close to
London however having studied there I
studied English literature for about two
months and soon I realised that it was
not the course for me I liked English
but I didn't love studying Chaucer and
Shakespeare it was almost historical and
I found that I was buying Shakespeare
for dummies and like reading some piece
of the books instead of doing my
homework so it became clear pretty soon
on that it wasn't the right course for
me so I actually made the really tough
decision to leave University and it was
made even more tough by the fact that I
had a 10,000 pound scholarship so
essentially I would have no university
fees to pay a raw Holloway so as you can
imagine that make the decision really
really hard but I knew I wasn't going to
enjoy studying it for three years so I
bit the bullet and finished handed in my
university notice and went back home
data gap here for you okay now with it
like someone getting really hot just
remove the GLA having several I said
earlier these students are boiling so
then I had a full year at home back in
Gloucestershire to really think about
what I wanted to do but before I knew it
it was time to start making those
choices again so that I could resend off
my new cast applications and apply to
another uni so I thought at this point
I'd always been quite entrepreneurial I
have a jewelry business I have a spray
tanning business so I thought okay I
should do something business e-business
management so I applied to loads of
unies including Kings UCL even Cambridge
and actually I got all of my offers
accepted so I could choose anywhere that
I wanted out of all of these top
universities but having gone to the
London College of Fashion opened a and
interview process I thought this is my
kind of place it really made me realize
that fashion isn't easy and it's not
like a DOS subject at least when I was
going to uni my teachers
made me feel like it wasn't a real
subject but looking back now it's so is
the fashion industry is massive as you
guys know it's so important and I think
I made the right decision by going to
London College of Fashion it was not an
easy interview process at all I think
one in 400 people if not more or less
get a place that apply there and the
interview process was actually fairly
brutal you had to stand up if your name
was called after a maths test and if
your name was called then you were out
you did not get a place so it was fairly
tough so I studied at London College of
Fashion for three years and my course
was be a fashion management which
covered marketing PR buying
merchandising accounting so really all
the skills you need to manage a fashion
business and I found it fascinating
absolutely loved it and at the end of my
three years I was very proud to complete
my dissertation which was on the social
meaning of goods so basically whether
people buy for the actual products or
for the brand behind it which I found
really interesting so I loved studying
customer psychology so this is my
dissertation and I graduated with a
first-class degree which I was really
really proud of and pleased with so
that's my university experience and now
I'm going to share my tips for starting
uni that hopefully might be able to help
you out if you are about to start uni so
my first tip is for those that have
actually not got to the application
stage yet my one tip would be not to
feel pressured into applying and not to
feel pressured into choosing a course I
definitely feel like I was slightly
pressured into choosing my English
degree and very very soon it became
clear that it was not the right thing
for me so don't feel pressured by your
teachers do your own research do work
experience so that you can really get
first-hand experience as to what the
different industries are like I think
school doesn't really touch on more
creative industries I was never told
about jobs in marketing or PR I just
didn't know they existed I'm sure you
guys watching this know now because I
don't know I think it's more kind of out
there but I had no clue that these jobs
existed and I know that I would have
gone for that kind of degree if I didn't
know so don't feel pressured by your
teachers who are probably trying to get
you to study the course that they taught
and also I think it's so important not
to pressured by your friends because
when you get to uni
friendship group just expands so much
you're going to have so many more
friends so definitely don't feel
pressured into going to uni just because
your best friend is there because while
it might be perfect for her it may not
be perfect for you my second tip for
those that are actually starting uni
this September would be to keep yourself
organized from the very start and that
sounds really obvious but to me this was
a case of treating myself to some really
cute stationery I always had lovely
notebooks lovely pens and I even
splurged on a laptop towards the
beginning of term and that really helped
me to stay focused and stay organized
during my lectures by writing notes
making sure they were legible and I'd
actually enjoy reading them through
afterwards because of all the cute
stationery so whatever is your
motivating factor keeping organized make
sure you stay on top of it you're going
to have so many deadlines and unlike
school you don't have teachers breathing
down your neck with a timeline and also
on that note I would say if you do get
given a big assignment then try and do
it straight away I know you've probably
heard it a million times before
there is nothing worse than even
something till last minute and then the
day before it's due you win maybe
there's a massive party or you just
don't feel up to it then you're screwed
so my best tip would be to get your work
done as soon as possible was all still
fresh in your head so I also briefly
mentioned that I got a laptop at the
beginning of turn another my friends
treated herself to an iPad and a
keyboard and that was her way of taking
her notes personally I would recommend I
know they're super expensive but I would
recommend getting the best laptop that
you can afford so whether that's for
Sony or an HP or a MacBook personally I
had a MacBook Air throughout my time at
you mean it was great too so lightweight
but I would say you use your laptop all
the time so do invest in whatever you
can and get the best laptop that you can
afford while we're on the techie kind of
note I would definitely recommend always
backing up your work I cannot even
explain how heartbreaking it is when you
spend hours and hours doing an essay
suddenly your laptop crashes or
something happens and you lose your work
so I would say get a hard drive from
Amazon or from eBay I will leave
to my hard drive down below it's really
good one or even if you don't want to
get hard drive just back up your work on
memory sticks this is something that
almost you have to have experienced in
using your work to make you do it so
please take it from me from your very
first assignment every time you save it
save it to a laptop and save it to your
memory card or hard drive because there
is nothing worse than working so hard
for hours and hours and then losing it
all
trust me another tip and a good habit to
get into as soon as you start uni is to
stay active I think that when you go to
university your lifestyle changes so
much perhaps you'll no longer walk into
school or you're no longer walking your
dog it's so easy to just stay in your
room watch Netflix do your work sitting
on your bed and not really be active so
whether you want to join some sports
clubs which is a great way of making
friends whether you love running or
perhaps you prefer to download some apps
personally I love an app called
seven-minute workout and you can just
work out in your room you just need a
pair of shorts an old t-shirt that is
literally it and just making sure you
stay fit will keep your energy levels up
and you'll be so much happier if you
keep fit and active during uni also of
course your diet is bound to change
quite a lot some of my friends ended up
eating quite a lot less because they
didn't have mom or dad there to cook for
them so they would just eat
practically nothing and then other
people like myself included would bulk
buy pasta and just make really
comforting and not to have any good few
dishes so I would say to keep an eye on
your diet there are so many recipes
online now they're really easy and cheap
to make so don't let yourself fall into
the trap of treating a subject on food
too often when you start uni
one way that I found that I was able to
eat cheaply while I was at uni was by
actually visiting and the nest and
Waitrose which I know are expensive
stores but if you figure out when your
local store start to reduce their food
then you're onto a winner so personally
M&amp;amp;S Brixton was my local one and they
used to put down the price of their food
around 6 p.m. God knows why because
surely everyone's commuting at that time
but I'm pick up so much food for super
cheap so I'd be able to get really
healthy vegetables soups for like 20 P
I'd get bread rolls for 5p it was
absolutely crazy anything that was good
out-of-date or needed to be eaten within
that day or the next day they would
slash the prices so definitely keep a
lookout in your local supermarket and
make sure you're aware as to when they
reduce their prices then you really can
eat well from much much less on that
note I would also say soups are really
nutritious and not too expensive way of
keeping yourself healthy plus they're so
easy to make if you've got a nutribullet
or a handheld blender both of which or
one of which I definitely recommend
getting you can just make yourself
something really healthy at home for not
too much money I think there are so many
positive reasons for getting a job as
soon as you get to university firstly
it's going to introduce you to a whole
new social group not just the people
that live in your flat or on your course
personally as soon as I got to London I
figured out that I'd got the place in
London College of Fashion
I took my CV out to loads and loads of
shops on Oxford Street in Knightsbridge
just everywhere and I would definitely
recommend taking your CV before the
start of term because when that day
comes that all of the students are
descending on the University campus
trust me everyone is going to be handing
out their CV so I would recommend
getting your CV out there two or three
weeks before the start of term just hand
it in to a member of staff say you're
starting University in two weeks time
and they'd be really interested for a
job they'll be really impressed you got
in there early you're super organized
and you'll have much less competition
also I'd say if you're working in
fashion or you're interested in fashion
getting a job in the shop floor is
really really beneficial of course I
already mentioned the friends but then
there's the discount and staff discount
I think my top shop discount was fifty
percent I think so you save a bit of
money plus you get free clothes for your
uniform and also of course you're making
money so University on top of your
student loan or your maintenance grants
it's always nice to have a little bit
extra in your bank account at the end of
every month if your degree is in fashion
or business or management then you're
also going to learn so many useful
skills from working on the shop floor
personally I think my interest in
customer psychology was really really
helped by working in Topshop
Knightsbridge and just watching people
shopping habits and really learning
about the operating system behind the
store if working in a shop just isn't
your
and you could work in a bar or
restaurant and also while I was
interning in my third year I didn't have
so much time but I needed to make extra
money so I signed myself up to a few
promotional agencies and these are the
kind of jobs where they're really good
fun and they're really well-paid as well
so personally I did jobs like being a
dress code assistant Royal Ascot I think
I made about 120 pounds a day sometimes
you get given the shitty jobs like
flyering or I don't know you can turn
down jobs I personally never did
flooring because I didn't really enjoy
that kind of thing
but you can do promo jobs I'm not sure
of any agencies particularly I think
there's one called create I don't never
leave a few down below there are really
good ways of doing something different
every day's if you get bored
s-super make new friends and you can
earn really good money and be flexible
with your times too so a notes on making
friends when it comes to university
firstly don't panic if you don't make
friends straight away I think a lot of
people presume that they're going to
move into university of halls and then
suddenly they're going to find bags
straight away who's going to be living
next door but often that doesn't happen
I think by joining different societies
and also finding a self a part-time job
can definitely help but also I would say
yes to as many social situations as
possible chances are even if you don't
get along that well with your flatmate
if she invites you to a party that might
be where you meet your BFF so definitely
be really outgoing and confident and say
yes to as many social opportunities as
you can when you first start uni when it
comes to university halls you often get
the choice as to whether you want to be
suffocated or you want to have your
meals provided for you personally I did
self-catered so I had to cook everything
myself which meant buying a lot of
kitchen appliances the mistake I made is
that I bought everything I bought condos
I bought blenders I've got massive pans
roasting trays you name it and I bought
it so if you're not careful you may just
end up with ten massive saves floating
around your kitchen so what I would say
is when you move to university just take
the basics things that you know that you
absolutely need from day one and then
once you and your flatmates all together
you can take an inventory of what you
have and what you're missing and then
buy things maybe one person buys a sieve
one person buys a roasting tray and then
you won't end up with kitchen full of
stuff that's going unused okay so a few
tips on when you're actually in
university itself one thing that I would
recommend and I know that this isn't
going to be for everyone but my tip
would be to be a teacher's pet you have
to remember that the teachers and tutors
that you have throughout university
could very well end up being not only
your dissertation supervisor but also
people that can help you get jobs so
don't be grumpy don't talk back to your
teacher I know sometimes it's really
hard but I would recommend being the
polite student that does her work on
time and it's a bit of a teacher's pet I
definitely think this helped me out when
I came to university if there was an
opportunity for work experience I had
really good relationships and my tutors
I could reach out to them for advice and
a few of my tutors I even keep in
contact with today and they've helped me
in my early stages of my career
especially when I worked at mulberry and
at the software company so definitely
keep your tutors on your side
textbooks can be really really expensive
in fact they're probably one of the most
expensive outgoings that you'll have
apart from a laptop at the beginning of
turn so what I would say is check on
ebay to start with so you can get them
secondhand because yes there are
different volumes but to be honest they
don't change that much and if there are
certain tweaks you can always ask friend
or download that certain part of the
book online also on this topic I would
say do not write in your textbooks don't
highlight them don't fall down pages
because whether you bought them new or
secondhand you'll be able to sell them
on whether it's to a student and you
below you or online again for much more
money if they remain undamaged so as
well as earning money by getting a soft
part-time job there are also quite a few
ways you can save money when you are
student I've already mentioned buying
food when it's reduced and there are
also ways you can save money of course
using things I make at movies making
sure that you make the most of two phone
offers and things like taking your own
popcorn to the cinema just being
sensible things like that not going
overboard with expensive items also make
the most of NUS student discount make
sure you sign ups as soon as possible
you get 10 sometimes 15 sometimes even
20% off in a lots of high street stores
and online as well so in any
card is really really useful as is a
student rail card I personally when I
was going back to Gloucester I was
saving about six pounds every single
journey with my student rail card so
make sure you look into those kind of
things also keep a lookout for magazine
freebies these can be often quite
valuable things like makeup sunglasses
so keep a lookout for magazines that
have good freebies and also if you live
in London and also on short other big
cities keep a lookout for guerrilla
marketing activity which is basically
when brands give out loads of free stuff
on the street just to make you aware of
the product try it out and hopefully buy
it in the future
I remember getting so excited when
stylus magazine were giving out free
packets full size packets of simple face
wipes I have no shame I just went round
and round around until I had like 10
packets of face wipes so to need to buy
any for a good few months afterwards I'd
also recommend entering giveaways
especially YouTube and blog giveaways
because you can win yourself some really
amazing stuff and sometimes on blogs
especially you don't even see that many
entries brands are so generous and they
want bloggers to giveaway products so
that they can increase their exposure so
definitely keep an eye out for giveaways
you could search hashtag giveaway on
Twitter or I think even like Martin
Lewis's money-saving tips I think
sometimes he shares giveaways which are
really good so keep a lookout for things
like that if you want to enjoy some more
luxurious items but don't want to
splurge on them and this one is also not
very politically correct but I did
actually mention it in my Q&amp;amp;A so I'll
mention it again here if you're a beauty
junkie like myself and you love high-end
makeup but you don't want to be spending
40 pounds on the New Deal foundation
don't have any shame in going into the
stores with your empty Mooji pot and
asking for a sample they can't expect
you to buy expensive foundations if you
haven't tried them out first so I
definitely recommend taking in pots I
know that loads of higher end brands do
it especially you can ask for sample and
then just live off these weak on samples
until you can afford to buy the proper
full-size foundation I think probably
for at least a couple of months when I
was going through a bit of tricky patch
money-wise
I didn't buy foundation for like two or
three months I just lived off these
week-long samples to be honest I would
go to Muji
because sometimes I stingy with their
own sample pots I buy like five and then
go to different counters and get them to
fill them up with
datian samples for me slightly
embarrassing looking back but hey ho try
to do what you got to do so next a few
essentials things to take with you and I
actually asked this I asked a few
friends what their opinions were firstly
I asked charlie and he said take
paracetamol for freshers week because
you will get headaches you will feel a
little bit worse for what I so
definitely take some paracetamol or
whatever is you will go to hangover cure
I also asked my friend Vicky and on the
other side of things she said take a
bottle of Prosecco because surely
they're going to be few flat warming
parties so it's always nice if you have
a bottle of Prosecco to welcome in the
new flat so then because I wanted a few
more tips from someone that has
literally just finished their first year
of uni I've also text Choi's little
sister Scarlett for some of her tips so
Scarlett has also sent over some
essentials for when you're just starting
uni she said random but don't forget to
take hangers often you will go to
university open up the Wardrobe have
loads of clothes ready to hang up but
they're not going to provide you hangers
this is something which you can collect
from shops often with especially high
street stores you can ask to keep the
hangers or just take a load from home
she also recommended to take an
extension lead and this I think is
really really important
often you're going to have a lot of
electronics at new charging you might
want to have a radio a lamp your laptop
your straighteners and perhaps your
straighteners plug may not be that close
to your mirror so taking an extension
cable will come in really really handy
scarlet also recommended taking lots of
pictures whether that's wall posters or
pictures of friends and family perhaps
you've got like a collage of all your
school friends because University walls
are playing white and boring so it's
really nice if you can add some
personality to walls with posters or
pictures anything like that and a lot of
unique walls don't allow you to take
blue tack or obviously pin links to the
walls but washi tape works really well
and washi tape is that kind of paper II
sellotape and it doesn't leave any marks
on the walls so what she take when it
comes to putting these on the walls will
be your best friend now this one is a
really good tip scarlet said to bring a
doorstop which is something that I
didn't do and looking back is such a
good idea especially when you're moving
in to start with you've got boxes you
always need to have someone holding the
door open for you so be really useful to
have a doorstop especially for this move
in days but also when you're in your
room unpacking it means that anybody
walking down the corridor can just stick
their head in and say hello which is a
great way of getting to know the people
in your new flat from the very beginning
this is really funny but she said also
during freshers week
don't overcompensate and get too drunk I
know it can be really easy to have a few
too many especially when you're a little
bit nervous things go to your head
straight away but you don't want to get
yourself a bad reputation from the very
first week so I'd say take it easy know
your limits and don't go getting smashed
and being that girl that passed out on
the university hall stairs on the
freshers week another really good tip
this girl is full of tips she said bring
a mattress topper and this is something
that I did but I've totally forgotten
you can get them read cheap I think from
like wilcos you can get them for around
ten pounds also have a look online but
university mattresses can be a little
bit hard or uncomfortable and you can
get memory foam ones for really really
cheap so definitely looking to taking a
mattress topper if you don't want to
have a sore back after a few nights in
your Union bed flip-flops scarlet said
the flip-flops are a good idea
especially in the communal areas I think
that university halls do lack hoovering
in some circumstances I know that I
would always wear my slippers
but flip-flops are a really good idea if
you want to just live into the kitchen
and don't have to put on a pair of boots
or don't want your slippers to get
ruined so flip-flops is another really
good essential and that's it from
scarlet and that's it for my university
tips and essentials so hopefully this
video will be useful if you're about to
start University or thinking of applying
to university in the coming weeks I know
it's coming up to that time of year
again you go back to school and suddenly
it's all about you cows you will hate
the word you cuss by the end of this
year trust me but yeah hopefully this
video has been useful for you guys if
you have any university tips of your own
any essentials or tips for making
friends or anything like that please
leave them in the comment section below
because I'm sure they will come in
really really handy to anybody else
watching this so for now please give
this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it
and if you found it useful subscribe if
you're new that I mean
to me and I'll see you in my next video
