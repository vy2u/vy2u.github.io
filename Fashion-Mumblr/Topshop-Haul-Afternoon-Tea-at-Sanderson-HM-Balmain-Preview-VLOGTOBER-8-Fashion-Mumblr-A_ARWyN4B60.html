I'm back home now after a little bit of
um not globe-trotting because it was
just just Amsterdam and been but that is
the last of my traveling for a little
while and still kind of hoping that I
might get to do a hot escape in winter
but yeah that's quite optimistic so home
now it's the afternoon on Tuesday this
morning I've just been taking a few blog
photos been quite productive actually my
to-do list is absolutely ridiculously
long and it's stressing me out how long
it is because I just have too little
time do you wants to do basically and
yeah this morning I was we were having
crazy huh
this morning I took some vlog photos
with the lovely new Tom Ford products
which I never showed you but I kind of
locked the meeting and then I edited my
Halloween tutorial which you guys would
have seen yesterday hopefully I think
that's a really cool video so definitely
going to check that out if you haven't
seen it already I did a zombie a zombie
bride makeup look and yeah really
pleased at how the video turned out so
yeah definitely go and check that one
out so a postman just came with a
Topshop delivery stuff thought I'd
quickly show you the pits it's the pits
the Hugh pieces that I got from Topshop
so this is the massive pile of stuff
that I just tipped out of my Topshop bag
and this is the first thing that jumps
out at me I kind of forgot that I
ordered this but would you think Dexter
which isn't it is huh what is it it's a
hot water bottle version of you
oh he likes it he likes it
so I got four pairs of sunglasses and
I'm probably gonna keep a maximum of two
pairs so you guys are gonna have to help
me decide which ones to keep these ones
I absolutely love the shape well hello a
reflection but you probably can't tell
but they're actually velvet and I did
not realize that they were going to be
velvet when I ordered them so yeah not
sure how I feel about velvet sunglasses
they might be one for my return pile
these I love the shape these not sure
again if you can see but they are kind
of like a brownie almost green color and
then it graduates you trying to jump up
little hunky
in fact Oh sunglasses yeah in the light
you can see that these are kind of a
green color and yeah I really like the
shape of those they are similar to my
Sophie cat eye ones which I wearing
basically every single outfit of the day
pose no naughty little boy these are my
leaves I've collected for an awesome
video that I've got planned and somebody
likes to shoot them so I'm gonna put
them away
these ones I think they may look a
little bit like airplane goggles when I
wear them because of the gold inside the
rim but I really like this kind of topi
pink color and I think that that might
just be rose gold so yeah try those on
let me know what you guys think then
what have we got over here
this looks really cool on the website
it's like one of those Indian headdress
things in fact I'll just try it on okay
so obviously haven't got the perfect
hair situation going on but I think
that's quite cool actually then I picked
up this is a really kind of cheeky treat
to myself another Olivia Burton watch
because I have been wearing my Caravelle
watch for ages and again need to your
hands and I just needed something a
little bit more delicate and autumnal so
I got this one and yep as predicted it's
absolutely beautiful so it's got the
rose gold face and then a topi pinky
leather strap which is a really thin
strap and that is absolutely stunning
and then the last two things are a
couple of coats this is just like your
classic everyday fling it on winter coat
and I really really love the look of
this fur hood and it's got some soft fur
on the inside how much was this 78
pounds pretty good for a coat of this
quality and then it's got the nice draw
strings on the waist so you can make it
nice and fitting and I've got another
coat as well which I've just hung up
here but it's that kind of manly blazer
a shape which is normally a little bit
too structured to me but it has got a
waist belt though I'll try this on and
let you guys know so I just did a really
quick makeup touch-up and tied my hair
up because now me and Charlie are going
out to try out the new annuity at Sanson
hotel I've blogged about the Sanderson
laughing teeth for a long time ago and
yeah we're going to go and see the new
afternoon tea today I thought I would
quickly tell you that the lipstick that
I'm wearing is new Tom watch it I don't
know if it's new I think it might be
quite a classic one it's Tom Ford it's
one of their mini lips and voice ones
which are the tiniest lipsticks ever so
perfect a handbag size and this is in
the shade called where's quite a random
name but um we I really love this color
I think this might be quite a classic
autumnal color which you'll probably see
me wearing and quite a lot more vlogs
and however I have to say it's really
hard to apply I probably should have
done it with a lip brush this is
slightly better lighting and and it's
quite patchy so you really need to blot
it and then go in again so hard to apply
but once it's on really love this color
I haven't made any effort in my hair as
you can see just stuck it in ponytail
but I'll show you what I'm wearing same
river island Roenick which been wearing
loads this autumn this is one I actually
was going to take back one so Bella jinx
it's been going with everything
something a little bit different to
black rolnick which is nice sunglasses
are the ones I just was telling you
about it went for the black with the
graduating in to brown ones and then
this is the skirt again I'm one of these
people as soon as I buy something I have
to wear it straight away I did manage to
finish the fall is quite big for so if
you're looking at this skirt the sizes
maybe go for your true size or one
smaller because as I said don't normally
fit into fours but did it this time and
then my Russell and Bromley Highline
boots and I thought these are black
tights but I think they might actually
be Navy but they look dark enough to go
wear with black I didn't realize there
was so much stigma around black tights I
read an article on them they give us the
Guardian this morning thing like just
talking about how tragic black tights
wear but I actually quite like them so
um yeah there's my black tights
so just sat down for unity in the beauty
service helping as
and so yeah they relaunched on the app I
have no idea they've got some new
sandwiches this is a crab Eclair in here
approach to egg salmon poached egg this
is spinach and cream cheese and a pan
got a monster
so Artie has arrived and I'm going to
try and remember everything was to show
you and up in here we've got a meringue
of carrots in the top here
and
marshmallow called mushrooms I'm sure
she said this is a chocolate and
pistachio caterpillar and then down here
these are red velvet ladybirds
and they've got a cherry and not cherry
cherry jelly inside these are strawberry
I think and chocolate Oreo what they
called apart cars this is a banana cake
butterfly and then we've got the white
rabbit chocolate macaroon stopwatch
and at the bottom there are the scones
and this is the drink my potion which I
think she save as passionfruit coconut
panna cotta
and possibly mango at the bottom so this
looks amazing
so here Dexter
for you most exciting
okay thank you very much
delicious if I was to use that and I
think okay maybe a little bit too much
chocolate because when you eat the
sandwiches which are amazing and then
there's bubbles as well they're just so
fun in your chocolate and then because I
was feeling so
very much
and so afternoon tea at Thomason was
absolutely amazing I was in such a food
coma for a little while afterwards and
now I'm just being it killing about an
hour of shopping and I didn't actually
buy anything i interested sitting around
Topshop a little while how many how it
early it's getting dark it's really
depressing it's starting to feel majorly
wintry but now I'm just heading towards
regional streets because rewards star
are putting on a burger master class
system on the route now you guys haven't
been to scary
hey guys it is Wednesday now I didn't
finish vlogging properly last night but
I was at the reward star master class
which is really really useful and yeah I
picked up lots of tips for like how to
put together Christmas gift guides and
yeah lots of dips that was really fun
and interesting this morning I have just
been working this role next feels really
really high is that super dragon I feel
like I'm kind of choked in are wearing
that kind of summit royal royal people
used to wear had a bit of a mad panic
this morning because I couldn't find
that I could hear him crying saying like
this is the outfit that I'm wearing
today and see I super dry it's a jumper
with a nice buttons on the color it's
really cozy but maybe my neck has shrunk
or something so I feel really bummed
into it and then this little skirt is
from Lipsy it's got little tussles on it
which is really cute because I'm
actually going to a
Lipsy event later so I thought I'd stick
on some lip see the same as yesterday's
shoe wise rust and Bromley Highline
boots and I thinks I don't have time to
change my backpack I will just take my
Radley one with me again so just heading
into town now I've got a meeting gonna
try and go to the new forest restaurant
and seventies rooftop I tried booking
earlier and it was full so fingers
crossed we'll go together
the first meeting of the day is done we
went to the restaurant on the river
sub-leaders which has just turned into
forest doesn't get used to be called
vintage salt but now as far as
restaurant which is really lovely we
just had a coffee but I definitely want
to go back for food because there was
lots of trouble things on the menu and I
was like ultimate favourite and now I
come to Argyle Street and I'm heading it
up eh no charity like shed which really
excited about because yeah shopping us
together and
