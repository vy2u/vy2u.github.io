is a Topshop and River Island kind of
autumn hall slash first day hall but
then I'm filming this is Monday and it's
my birthday tomorrow and around this
time of year I tend to just like on a
little bit of a shopping spree nothing
too crazy just to buy myself a few
little sneaky birthday presents I did go
into River Island a couple of times and
Topshop I made a big online order so I
picked up some really lovely pieces um a
few festive bits and bobs so I've got
some Christmas socks some Christmas
things from Topshop and some loads of
knitwear lots of sparking network so
kick off with this jumper that I'm
wearing now I'm definitely one of these
people that always wants to wear my new
bits so yeah picked up this jumper not
sure how much of it you can see but so I
come a lovely powder blue jumper with a
roll neck which is actually quite
strange neck I didn't really know
whether to have it up fully like this or
rolled down and gone with rolled down to
the west don't really have much of a
neck but yeah I picked up this jumper
from Topshop I really like this color
it's quite fresh for this time of year
um and yeah I think we really nice to go
in springtime as well it's got a seam
detail going down the middle and ripped
its effect on the sleeves as well which
I really like
so that was the first thing that I got
from Topshop I can't remember how much
as far as I'm afraid but I'll put all
the prices or links to the products down
below so you can go and pick them up if
you want to next thing I got from
Topshop excuse the UM M&amp;amp;S hanger was
this pink sparkly jumper I think because
it's coming up on birthday I just wanted
something a little bit sparkly maybe
wear this tomorrow in the daytime this
was 60 pounds though so quite pricy not
something I'd normally splurge on but I
think it's a yeah it's Topshop boutique
so yeah I need to be really careful with
this one not just an
with an in jewelry but I just thought
it's a really nice color absolutely love
this kind of movie pink at the moment
and again it's got like tight-roped
sleeves see at about this one as well
from a Topshop I don't know how I feel
about the v-neck definitely need to try
this one on because Phoenix always
remind me a lot of it's called jumpers
hopefully this won't look too six for me
but yeah I'll give it a go
another jumper from Topshop that I
picked up was this one and I absolutely
love the style of this one I think it
looks much more expensive than it was
and I paid 49 pounds for this so still I
mean not mega cheap but Topshop jumpers
aren't normally that cheap I'm afraid
the Lighting's kids have you know a bit
crazy gonna pick it up but it's got the
typical kind of ferrule plaited knitted
detail down the middle and then it's got
these really cute tassels as well either
side which I think just had a really
nice effect to it the sleeves are quite
plain I like the neckline of this one as
well it's quite a high not a roll neck I
think these are called like a funnel
neck detail which I really like I think
it's nice and cozy this time of year I
also love that you can put a thermal on
underneath these kinds of jumpers and
you can't see it which is them which is
a bonus when it's absolutely freezing
outside see I love this one love the
color and I think I'll be wearing this
an awful lot over the next few months I
might as always just called this a
Topshop knitwear haul because honestly
don't buy any clothing from Topshop
apart from knitwear so I also got this
lovely pink jumper and it's got really
cute detail on it with gold thread and
little pearls in the middle hopefully
you can see that in the camera but
really love the color of this one nice
scoop neck this was 39 pounds a little
bit cheaper than the other ones I just
thought the pastel pink was such a
gorgeous color and it's a little bit
special with the pearls and the gold
threads so again nice for a date tonight
look another jumper surprise surprise
this one I'm not too sure about it's
pretty my least favorite of the bunch
it's a kind of cream and white striped
it's not coming up very well on camera
but it's cream and whites and really
chunky thread this was 45 so not takes
I do love knitwear I think I wear knit
wear every single day and autumn like
it's it's cold you just want to layer up
so maybe I will keep this long so I
don't have too many pale knits and then
again it's got this phrase detail or
something the camera it's got this
frayed detail at the bottom which I
really do like a think if you wear it
over jeans it just adds an another
special little detail so I'll give this
a try and think about it but I do have a
lot of knitwear and it's probably my
least favorite off bunch from least
favorite to most favorite I got this
gray one unfortunately as I bought
yesterday and I had quite a lot of
makeup on yes they've already got a bit
of makeup on the neck that's the only
thing about this neckline is that I tend
to put a little bit of makeup all over
them but this is just a plain gray
jumper again it's got these tassels down
at the bottom and it just looks really
nice I wore my boohoo dark denim jeans
and it just looked really cute over the
top of them and then it's got folded
cuff hems and really big oh no textures
trying to get something from underneath
wardrobe but yeah really like how thick
and warm this neckline is yesterday I
was watching Charlie play rugby not
yesterday before on Cesare's watching
Charlie play rugby and it was it said
six degrees on my snapchat temperature
of I swear it was more like than minus
six it felt so cold but luckily this
obviously went right around my neck so
it's really nice and warm and snuggling
is quite plain but just with the tassels
at the hem just makes a really nice
detail so I love that one and I think
I'll be getting a lot of use out of that
one didn't tell me how much is I don't
have the tagging anymore as I said I
will leave all the links down below and
the final clothing that piece that I
picked up from Topshop is a grey roll
neck match is not roll neck again it's
like a funnel neck but it's very plain
it's got buttons on the sleeves but this
is the kind of thing again I wear an
awful lot in autumn going into winter
you can put a thermal underneath there
and grace is such a classic color so I
think again
a lot of use out of that one whether
it's with skirts or jeans fixer I just
think I will wear that one quite a lot
and yes I've got quite a lot of knitwear
and tops from Topshop I did also treat
myself to a bag I haven't taken the
plastic off this one yet this is a kind
of wine burgundy plum shade clutch bag
with a long gold cup of tissue paper
still on it long gold strap this was 22
pounds which I don't think is too bad
and this type of bag is really great for
this time of year because you go to a
lot of evening things and my evening
bags are all either
no and my evening bags are all either
like designer like mulberry but they're
quite old I haven't treat myself to a
design by it a long time so I thought
I'd get this to just bring a little bit
more excitement to my evening bag
selection it's got a really chunky gold
sit along the top so nice and secure if
you're yeah and it's a nice and secure
if you're going to be using it like
around London or underneath public
transport and then then inside you have
got a zippy pocket and the plain pocket
is well putting your mobile phone in so
quite so definitely a useful bag to have
for the next few months I think and then
the other bits and bobs that I got from
Topshop are all kind of accessories
firstly I picked up three of their
Christmas socks so these are three pump
fifty each I think it was three for
eight pounds or three for eight pound
fifty and I got this pet which is gray
with the reindeers and snowflakes pink
pair with gingerbread men and candy
canes and the same gingerbread man and
campaign in Crete as well Dexter just
found this on the floor part of my
Christmas decorations so so if you could
hear a rustling I'm just going to put
that somewhere where you can't reach it
now he's trying to jump on the bed it
was such a fool again no so in the
festive thing that I picked up from
Topshop with these glittery and this I
was obviously quite hyper and looking
bored Christmas when I made my
my order but it's basically a headband
with gold sparkly antlers in it so this
should be fun for any Christmas parties
or on Christmas Day we all just get a
little bit silly so I'll definitely
bring these out Christmas Day
these were 12 pounds so not cheap before
you make them if you have the time and
effort to do that but I think they're
just rather cute so yeah glad I picked
those up and I also got a sheet of
Christmas stickers again I'm not really
sure I was thinking so I can't imagine
having to use these maybe put them on
the gifts or in cards or something
there's a cute little heart that says
love from Santa a tree that says you on
the nice list another tree that says
some no peeking and then the star that
says open me so you have putting use
these for when I'm wrapping up my
Christmas presents and then last but not
least from Topshop I picked up a lip
palette didn't really need any more lip
products so I just thought the color of
this one if you can see it was really
really nice it is called motel and it's
quite quite a brownie I have so many
berry pink spice absolutely love them
brownie plummy pink I'm wearing it today
so yeah hopefully guys like this shade I
really love Topshop lip bullets I
finally last so long on the lips and
even though they're matte which I really
like this time of year they're not
drying which is really important when
the weather gets cold I find that my
lips get really really dry and yeah they
do with the top lip but it's so really
love the formula of these so that's it
from Topshop then as I said I did do a
couple of trips to River Island the
first trip that I did into store I
wasn't planning on buying anything that
this coat was on the display as soon as
you walk in so I just had to pick this
one up and is this one here it's getting
quite hard to show you but it's got a
really lovely faux faux fur lining and
then on the outside it's kind of
different textured suede side say like
this is more of a crackled leather and
sure it's not suede it's just like a
crackled leather and then the sleeves
are a faux leather in this lovely beige
color going down to a turned-up faux fur
cuff it's got gold buttons and then
you've got this kind of like buckle
detail around the waist which is really
lovely the back is my
we the crack would lever but then at the
top you've got the normal leather and
the normal leather on the side panels as
well I actually saw this one and took a
photo and tweet it out did a little poll
as to whether you guys thought I should
buy it or not I think like 97% that I
should start secondly kind of peer
pressured into buying this on but I
really love it it's quite because we'll
the fur it's quite tight to wear over
jumpers so it's definitely better I'm
slightly warmer days or days when I can
just I don't need to wear a big thick
jumper but yeah really really love this
one again I'm sorry I can't remember how
much it was but I'll leave that
information down below and then the
second part of my Riverland haul was
when I was invited into the style studio
which is basically the personal shopping
section on the top of the ravine store
um or not to a street to near Marble
Arch so it's really really loved in
there if you're going to buy a few
things I'm definitely recommend you go
in the style suite style studio first
thing that I got were these purpley
lilac faux leather trousers so I really
really like trousers aren't jeans in
winter I just find out how so many jeans
and it's really nice when you discover
something a little bit different the fit
on these was absolutely perfect for me
really true to size and nice and tight
like this is really weird but nice and
tight around the crotch area like I hate
it when you get you know when it bundles
up around here absolutely hate it but
these fit really really nicely I really
like the color and I think they'll go
with quite a lot of my autumnal outfits
I'm not too sure what to wear heel wise
I think boots might be a good option or
kind of white stilettos something
similar for a more of an evening look I
also picked up this blouse um it is a
long sleeve blouse with a tie around the
waist really hard to show you but
basically imagine like a normal shirt
shape in quite a loose almost like a
chiffon you fabric it's not ship on it's
probably polyester but it hangs really
beautifully and it's quite nice to have
a tie around the waist it makes it more
of a more of a nice feminine fit and I
just thought these colors are all really
lovely
quite all-time nor with the light Browns
in the black in there but the pink
just makes it very me so really love the
shirt actually wore this um not last
night but the night before we went for
like an early birthday dinner at this
restaurant near where Charley's parents
live and I wore this with white jeans
and some new Brown over knee boots which
I have and really loved that outfit so
yeah really glad to pick this up this
top I picked up actually to wear with
the purple trousers and it's a v-neck
kind of like a kimono style top really
hard to show you without me disappearing
from the screen and this is 35 pounds we
thought was a really good price for a
top like this so you've got quite short
sleeves
um and then wrap around the waist and I
just thought quite nice thick fabric so
really nice this time of year if you
just want to have something that's
slightly more evening ish but it's not
gonna be too cold I know it's short
sleeves but mythic fabric means
hopefully it won't be too cold for you
know dinners out at this time of year my
this might wear this for my birthday
meal but have really decided yet and
finally and I have not stopped wearing
this since I got it completely
overtopped if I did not need two coats
but I just fell in love with this one
and this one again is super soft for
faux fur on the lining and then yeah it
just goes down to be like a reverse
suede with fur on the seams and again
fur cuffs pocket details are fur with
faux fur with a zip closure which makes
them nice and secure and then there's
like press stud fastenings which I don't
really use but you know it's really nice
and then again you've got the seams on
the back but this I think there's
definitely under 100 pounds come over
exactly how much I paid for it I just
saw it was so lovely and honestly it's
just not been taken off it since I got
it so absolutely loved this one and one
other thing from Emma Ryland I shouldn't
really mention in a hawk's is actually
an early birthday present but I loved it
so much I wanted to mention anyway and
it is scarf which Charlie's mom got me
for my birthday and it's from River
Island and just the colors are so me
you've got some Browns in there some
kind of blonde matches which is my hair
color um and yeah it's such a lovely
thing I think I wear this a lot over
black role necks or if I've got any
quite plain outfits because all of these
colors are quite neutral say should
with lots of things but yeah as I said
that was an early birthday present not
strictly part of my whole but I thought
I'd show you just because I'm doing
River Island anyway and that's
everything that I picked up in my
pre-birthday haul I just felt like
treating myself and they are definitely
two of my favorite shops I have also got
an egg sauce order that I might have
made last night that's probably arriving
at some point today there might be
another haul on this channel very soon
but I hope you guys enjoyed looking
through all these bits and bobs let me
know down in the comments if you've
spotted anything that you really really
like if there's anything that you don't
like maybe I should turn back but yeah

think I definitely don't need to buy
much but I'm definitely I'm going to I
definitely don't need to buy too much
