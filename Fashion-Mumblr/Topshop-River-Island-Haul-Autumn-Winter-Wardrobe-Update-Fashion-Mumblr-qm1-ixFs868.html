me for today's video is going to be a
collective River Island and Topshop haul
so I have been making a few orders over
the past three weeks or so and these are
just pieces to really help to boost up
my autumn wardrobe a few pieces I could
not resist that I have seen on the neuen
page over the past few weeks so instead
of doing a few separate holes I thought
I would just lump them into one big haul
a few of these pieces you may have
already spotted if you've been keeping
up with my Instagram which is Josie LDN
and we recently hit a hundred thousand
followers on there so if you're not part
of my Instagram family then please check
it out I'll leave a link to the page
directly down below and loads of fashion
in spoke over there I've been wearing a
few pieces from this haul over on there
in Boston in Vermont recently and you
may have seen a few of them in my Boston
outfit Diaries and my Thurmont video but
I want to share them as part of this
haul and I am going to actually get
started with what I'm wearing now
because I'm always guilty you're
forgetting what I'm actually wearing I'm
one of these people that can't buy a lot
of new stuff and not to wear it right
away so the jumper that I'm wearing is
from Topshop for me this is just a
perfect classic cream knit this piece
I'm sure you already know this but the
cream knit wear is just one of those
pieces that you find yourself reaching
for and wearing time after time after
time today I'm wearing it with just a
pair of denim jeans and but I also
actually wore this yesterday with a
corduroy miniskirt and over knee boots I
love that it's a great layering piece
put your thumb on underneath it and yeah
this was around 42 pounds so really
great just autumn staple piece to get
things started I'm gonna tie my hair up
for the rest of this haul because I
can't concentrate with my hair down so
excuse me while I just pin this back
these are the most useful things in the
entire world
they are hairdressing clips from a brand
called head jog which i think is genius
they're probably my most used things in
my entire life anyway um so the next two
pieces are bits that are already on
hangers because they have already been
worn quite a few times and you'll
probably recognize these first of all
and let me show you them individually I
get a million questions about my hangers
as well they're all from Primark very
very affordable
Kommandant so the first piece that I've
been wearing a lot already are my faux
suede leggings from River Island these I
was so chuffed when I saw them on the
website I knew instantly that they would
be such a wearable piece in my autumn
wardrobe but these I featured in my
autumn look book which I'll leave linked
on the screen now that's one of my
favorite videos of the last like six
months of please go check that out if
you haven't already loads of ideas on
how to style these because they are faux
suede as you can imagine very
comfortable pretty warm I say like a
seven out of town on the warmth scale
and they have got a little bit of
stretch to them which makes them very
very comfortable to wear not a huge
amount of stretch not like legging
stretch but more than you would think
for something that is both suede color
wise I find them very first hard they
look great with black ankle boots they
look great with over new boots styled
over the top of them I wore them with
black open e boots
in Boston and I absolutely love that
outfit these I think around 35 to 45
pounds not terribly expensive and
already everyone unloads it's a price
per where I'm very very happy with this
purchase and yeah a real autumn staple
speaking of leggings I also bought this
pair when I went to the personal
shopping in Topshop foxes circus a
couple of weeks ago they are also like a
faux leather legging a little bit more
shiny than leather perhaps would be but
these are so comfortable they are super
super stretchy as I can demonstrate and
they also have almost like a brushed up
fleecy linings they're just the most
scrumptious things to wear this is yeah
almost like a felt lining very very
comfortable they just feel like you're
wearing pajamas out in public
I love the burgundy color I did a whole
blog post on my love for Burgundy
recently again I'll leave that link down
below for me burgundy is basically like
a neutral in autumn winter
I personally don't love wearing a lot of
black so burgundy is a color that I find
very flattering and works with a lot of
different outfit combinations so all
three of the pieces I've showed you so
far just very very versatile and
definitely staples for an autumn water
there is gonna be a bit of an unboxing
latex I have got a whole river island
order that I haven't even opened yet it
arrived this morning but for these first
few bits and I have started wearing
already I'm just gonna kind of hop
between retailers so everything on the
link down below so don't worry
it gets a little bit confusing but down
below I'll separate it into provide and
talk shop these speaking of autumn
wardrobe staples again I saw these on
the river on a website and I had to buy
them just out of my own curiosity I love
over new boots I have maybe already
published an entire video on over new
boots if I have a game that'll be links
it up here somewhere I find over new
boots just the most beautiful thing in
an autumn wardrobe I love how they make
an outfit look they really elevate so
many different outfits whether that's
jeans and a t-shirt or a jumper dress so
when I saw this pair amend I just had to
try them so positives and negatives the
positive would definitely be the price
point I think for 75 pounds they look a
lot more expensive than that and they
give your outfit a real luxurious feel
which for that price I think it's very
very good I love the color of them this
dark grey again is something a little
bit different to black but still in
neutral so very very wearable the
negative I would say is that they don't
have much of a soul here if that makes
sense they don't have much between your
foot and the ground so it can be a
little bit uncomfortable after a full
day of wear but I've not found that to
be too much of a problem but the main
issue I have with them is that they are
very hard to get on these ones I really
have to roll them all the way down and
really wrench them up which when I
compare that to my slightly more premium
over new boots you don't have that
problem that's so easy to slide on these
just don't have that elasticity in them
and but that doesn't mean that they're
very tight fitting on the leg so I guess
it depends on where your priorities are
I would say to try them before you buy
them whether that's in store or online
obviously a try and have a really good
return process I still love them I think
that once they're on they're worth it
but it is worth mentioning that they are
quite harder to get on something that I
really love to wear with my overly boots
is leather leggings now you may know I
recently invested in the Reese carry
never leggings but they are very
expensive so I wanted to share with you
also a slightly more affordable
alternative much more affordable
alternative I said I don't have much
black but I do find that black leather
leggings in the autumn winter is
something that I really do crave and
they find that they work with so many
different outfit combinations so I
picked up this pair of I think they're
dreamy jeans actually yeah
me high-waisted ankle Grace's from the
Topshop these obviously aren't leather
but they are coated which gives them
that real leather effect for someone
like me that doesn't have a lot of black
in their wardrobe and I don't
necessarily want to really invest in a
pair of black leather leggings something
from the high street like this is a lot
more sensible in my opinion so I picked
up these they look great with over new
boots they look great with ankle boots
and this slight sheen to them does give
them a really luxe finish this next
piece I was very very thankful for
during our time in Vermont it is a very
cozy faux shearling jacket from River
Island not sure what color the camera is
picking up but it is almost like a gray
chocolate brown color I wouldn't say
it's gray or brown it's kind of
somewhere in the middle almost like
looking in some lights but it's just a
really beautiful cozy jacket really good
price point as well from River Island
shearling jackets are the kind of thing
that do come into fashion year after
years those into minds as to whether I
wanted to really invest in a more
premium piece but as it's a trend that
I've not really tried before I thought
I'd start off with something much more
affordable but still very very beautiful
and just kind of test a trend out see
how much where I get out of it before
maybe one day investing in a more luxury
shearling coat it sounds a little bit of
a wild card so I picked this up having
spotted it on the hangers in Topshop
Oxford Circus and I was just brilliant
reached by it I personally love white
dresses in autumn again with over knee
boots I think they're beautiful this I
think is the perfect autumn dress not
only has it got slightly longer sleeves
not are they're going to keep you warm
because they are lace but it does give a
more autumnal vibe great for layering if
you've got maybe one of those teddy bear
coats a faux shearling coat could look
really beautiful over the top of this
and to be totally honest I thought it
had kind of Zimmermann vibes about it
and it's the sort of piece I can imagine
okay sure wearing and she's one of my
favorite instagramers I love her outfit
I love how she puts together lots of
different pieces especially during the
autumn months I can definitely imagine
her wearing something like this with a
teddy bear coat over her shoulders and
that's the vibe asking for when I picked
this up Baxter River Island and again if
you've been following my Instagram or
outfit Diaries videos you'll recognize
this one it is the most classic
versatile and just amazing jumper dress
from River Island I have the pink
version of this too and I may not stop
there I made
in a few more colors but as soon as I
saw the jumper dress coming in cream on
the website
I ordered it straight away so this one
is just the softest material it is so
cozy to wear it's almost just I can't
even describe it is like wearing a
dressing-gown out in public which I love
it's got slightly ballooning sleeves so
a little bit of a nod to that trend but
it's still very very wearable lengthwise
it comes up to about mid thigh so you
can get away with basically any kind of
footwear you can wear ankle boots you
can wear over new boots i styled this
with black pony boots in Boston and I
also really love the neckline of this it
comes up just high enough that you can
wear a vest or a thermal underneath it
and keeps you really lovely and snuggly
I could not recommend this piece enough
as I said I've worn it so much already
and I know that I'll continue to wear it
so so much in the coming colder months
so this is from my latest order from
Topshop calm these pieces I haven't
thoroughly decided if I'm going to keep
yet so your advice and thoughts will be
very much appreciated first of all this
bag so this was 35 pounds which i think
is really really good and I felt that
this had slight nods towards the JW and
the sandbags it definitely has that kind
of vibe about it
Topshop bags you can tree tell the price
point of them these days I've bought a
bag recently it was 95 pounds from their
premium section but this is 35 pounds
and I feel like this looks a lot more
premium than that price tag so that's
great
one thing that I'm but don't know if I
like that is that you have to kind of
undo it from the bottom and then open it
up but then it is really lovely and
spacious inside I could probably fit my
laptop in there
just about and then it does have a
shoulder strap but overall I just
thought this is a really lovely bag for
35 pounds so I'd be very interested here
opinions so please let me know in the
comment section whether this is a yay or
a nay from you guys next we have a few
more Footwear pieces these are
incredible Chloe dupes from Topshop so
as you may know I have the beige Chloe
Susannah boots and I love them I have no
regrets but I still do think about the
black ones every now and then so when I
saw these in Topshop I thought I had to
go for it they are probably the best
dupes I've seen out there obviously
there are websites that just completely
ripoff and copy designer shoes these
have slight design details but I
they could definitely get away with
being a real deal and again unlike some
of the more low price retailers they
just feel very well made I really trust
a Topshop when it comes to quality you
know what you're going to get from them
and they are well-made they've got a
leather lining they've got beautiful
buckles really nice to embellish details
and whether you care or not that they
are G with the code boots I still think
they're a really lovely style so a
lovely black ankle boot to add to my
autumn collection and then another pair
of boots from Topshop you can tell I buy
a lot of boots in autumn but I do find
that you wear boots every day like what
other kind of shoes do you really wear
an autumn boots pretty much so I picked
up this pair of great boots from Topshop
I also have these in pink and I really
love the heel of these I think the shape
of this heel just has a slight 60s nod
to it which I adore these are 79 pounds
so a little bit more expensive than
previous styles but very versatile and I
think that the price per wear on a shoe
style like this will come right down
again these are faux suede and they look
really good with those floats suede
leggings that I showed you also with
denim and also potentially with dresses
as well if you're wearing an autumnal
dress a maxi dress and these would be a
really nice way to finish that off so
next I'm going to go through my actual
recent sort of island order this is the
ginormous box that arrived this morning
there is one thing in particular that
I'm really really excited to have a look
at so I'm going to have to hold my
little hooligan show you this next piece
because he's decided he wants to shred
all over the packaging and we don't want
you to turn on any plastic now Dooley
you should see the room when I film
hauls it is literally a bomb site and so
the piece that I was very very excited
to show you is this handbag I spotted
this on the river ina website yesterday
immediately made an order for Next Day
Delivery because this is the first that
I have seen high street dupe of the
Chloe Pixy bag now when it comes to bags
such as a Chloe pixie
I've sometimes may potentially end up
investing like I did with the Chloe Nile
and the Gucci darkness but I like to get
a dupe first because it really helps me
to decide whether that style is going to
work my wardrobe whether I love it or
whether it's a bit of
in the pants so when I saw this it was
an instant purchase decision I went for
the green color as opposed to the black
I thought it's a little bit more unusual
a bit different for autumn and I think
this could be an incredibly versatile
bag inside I feel like I could
definitely fit my vlogging camera my
purse my camera on my phone or that kind
of jazz and then it's got a shoulder
strap which I love it means that I can
be hands-free limehouse without shopping
etc etc but then you can also on the
clip the shoulder strap and hold it like
this if you so desire and then if you
have seen yet to my video on the five
over knee boot styles that I love you'll
have heard me saying that when it comes
to opening boots I like to invest in
more classic styles that's when I look
to retailers like Karen Millen steer
white some unrest I'm Bromley but when
it's a more of an on-trend style then I
will definitely look to the high street
because you just know nerve these trends
are going to be around for a long time
so when it comes to the knitted boot
trend I really like it and I'm very keen
to experiment with it but it wasn't sure
how long that trend would be around for
so I didn't want to spend a load so I've
gone for these in River Ireland not
cheap they were 85 Ashley that's not
cheap at all so these are gonna have to
look really good in order for me to keep
them but they are burgundy color or for
any dimension how much I love Burgundy
this season trying to like a whiny more
purple burgundy and they've got faux
suede on the heel and then this knitted
socks boots style going all the way up
I'm very intrigued to try these
hopefully they'll look really nice with
a jumper dress they are going to have to
do something quite special for me to not
return them because yes not as
affordable as I think I thought they
were and then my final piece is
something from Topshop that I know I
will get so much wear out of when the
temperatures really start to drop it is
this Firth faux fur umm which of course
a scarf or a stole I think I would
probably call it a stole basically I got
something like this from race last year
and it was more pink this I thought was
more neutral and I love wearing this
over the top of coats or G Lay's and
wanted to start to get really chilly
it's just a really nice way to elevate
an outfit and make your coat look a
little bit smarter I mean you look a bit
different to how it looked the day
before when you wore it particularly
with camel coats or really neutral color
coats this just works so so well you can
tuck it into your belt and still have
that really lovely feminine
or if you're just going out wearing a
jumper then this just adds a little
extra layer of warmth in fact it's
making me very warm right now yeah this
was from Topshop around the 30 pound
price mark I really love the color of
this almost like a white cream faux fur
with brown tips ombre brown tips down
there and it's actually got a bit of a
hook and eye as well so you can secure
it in place
if you want to so those are the pieces
that I bought from the high street
recently from Topshop and River Island I
really hope you enjoyed living through
them with me I actually had a couple of
people asking when I was going to do
another a sauce haul to be honest at the
moment I'm really just not inspired by
what's on a source at the moment so
hopefully when we start to get slightly
more cooler temperatures here in the UK
is still quite mild and then maybe
they'll bring in some more bits and bobs
that are very lovely but at the moment
I'm just not inspired and not gonna do a
whole just the sake of it despite what
my surroundings would fear right now but
anyway that's all from me please do give
this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it
