video so I know last week on my youtube
channel was whole week and I did a whole
video of you guys every single day that
is just that's just not enough I thought
that I would film today's video because
it actually did make a rather large
Topshop order a couple of days ago and I
also have some really amazing new things
to show you from River Island so instead
of just unpacking it and trying it on I
thought I would film another haul video
for you guys and so that's what today's
video is going to be for I get started
word of warning things could get pretty
hot in here because it's 31 degrees in
London today like I don't even know how
that's possible it's not even that warm
in Greece but I just checked my ass it's
31 degrees
so I'm roasting I've got my ring light
on I've got the patio door shut so that
you can't hear the builders next door
and so they can't hear me so yeah pretty
hot in here even Dexter combos do
anything he's just been lying on the
floor all day not really moving it's
just too hot for sausage dogs and it's
too hot for me some ROG tie my hair up
because I just get too hot and sweaty
with my hair down okay that probably
looks awful but I'm alive ah did you
hear that basically the postman just
came and he didn't even bother knocking
on the door he just shoved a mist and
everything through the letterbox but I
ran after him don't you worry I'm not
sure what it is I'm not going to have a
look in case it's something for the
whole hornacek it was part two of my
river island order so actually that has
worked out pretty well
okay so distractions aside let's get
started with the whole video I am
actually going to start with Topshop
because there's a few things that I
wanted to show you that I picked up in
store last week and apologies if you
watched my come shopping with me video
that I filmed kind of like vlogging
style while I was actually shopping on
Oxford Street because you may recognize
these but I thought I'd very quickly
mention them again because I love them
and I think they're some of my favorite
purchases in a long time
and the first one is this I didn't
actually really give this much attention
on the vlog and because I actually saw
it on my way to the till it was just
hanging there right in my pathway right
in my eyeline and I just fell in love it
straight away every time I wear it
outside get so many compliments from my
friends I think it looks a lot more
designer it could be like a Latino or
Phillip Lim but it's basically a silver
box bag it's big enough for an iphone
six-plus which for me is very important
when it comes to handbags it's got a
lovely gold strap this kind of push lock
detail in the middle and I've been
finding that metallics is going to be a
trend this autumn at least I think it is
and I don't really love metallic
clothing but metallic accessories I love
and this is silver with gold detailing
so you can kind of wear it with silver
or gold so pick this up and absolutely
love it having said what I just said
about metallic clothing these are kind
of metallic but they're like a pearly
material they're basically a pair of
culottes I'm not going to try them on
because I know what they look like but I
will insert a photo here of me wearing
them and because they've got an elastic
waist they're just so comfortable they
are literally like the kind of trousers
that you want to wear if you're going to
eat loads because they found along with
your tummy I know from experience um and
they just look really lovely there are
lovely length or lovely lightweight
material and they wash well I've washed
them twice already and I just think with
a white t-shirt or a white blouse silk
t-shirt maybe they look stunning and I
think I kind of resisted this trend for
quite a while but now I'm just obsessed
with these trousers and a second pair of
trousers from my Oxford Street all these
are a pair of wide leg trousers not
really clots because they're full length
or at least they're full length on me
cuz I'm quite short and but once again
really hard to show you so I'll put a
photo right here and I just been loving
wearing these I think I'll be wearing
these into the cooler months as well
because they are a fairly thick material
they're quite warm to wear if I wore
them today I would be sweltering and but
I just adore the color this beautiful
blush pink is really my favorite color
basically nice and high-waisted and
instead of the first ones I showed you
that quite see through these you can
pretty much get away with wearing
underwear whereas those you have to
think a lot more carefully so they're
the bits and bobs I picked up in the
shop as I said I did do like a live full
video come shopping with me on Oxford
Street which you guys seem to really
enjoy so I'll leave that link down below
in case you didn't catch it
and also I'm thinking of doing more
videos like that on different shopping
streets so maybe like come shopping with
me on Regent Street come trouble me in
Westfield like if I go to America in
like a mall or something so let me know
if that's something you'd like to see
but for today's video I actually have a
lot of stuff that I ordered online so
this is my top shop order I've got a
smaller bag here and then a massive bag
I actually think this is the biggest bag
I've ever got from Topshop I think
there's a couple person shoes in here
feels like it and so that's probably why
but actually to ease myself in I'm going
to start with a smaller bag okay let's
dig in gosh
everything's wrapped in a very fancy way
this has got like cardboard wrapped
around it very strange oh yeah I
remember this okay so this is a squishy
handbag or like a clutch bag it's like
this really squidgy material quite
strange and then you've got a gold zip
at the top it's actually got a loop I
can pull it out there we go so the same
kind of squishy material that the bag is
made out of is looped around a gold
chain for the clasp and I just saw this
be quite a useful size for evenings out
I already have anything this size or of
this design I really like the color I
think it'll go with a lot of my late
summer kind of awesome clothing that
I've been buying recently this beautiful
blush pink that just pretty much goes
with everything in my wardrobe and it is
a very good size I'll be able to put my
phone sorry my phone's going off they're
just silent yeah I'll be able to fit my
phone some lipstick my camera and feel
the bits and bobs in here so picked that
one up and because I'm the most
indecisive person in the world I also
got it in this burgundy oxblood color
these were 32 pounds each so I will not
be keeping both of them I thought this
was a lot more autumnal and I don't
really have any autumnal clutch bags
whereas I do probably have bags of a
similar color to that one so maybe this
will come in
and II because I don't have anything
similar but let me know you guys think
which one should I keep if any should I
keep both should I not keep any of them
let me know what you have what's up next
is pair of jeans
I just love Topshop jeans I think
they're really good value per wear and
these ones are the dree cropped kick
flare I remember the days when I used to
work in Topshop I used to know all the
jeans names but now I just don't have a
clue and basically these have got the
free hems so this has been quite stylish
recently I think they look really good
with mules that kind of shoe style and
if you have a statement pair of shoes
and I think this kind of hem really
accentuates it and creates a nice frame
for the shoes so I'm hoping this will
come up to about ankle legs like above
the ankle but I have got quite short
legs so I will try these on and let you
know I actually don't know how I feel
about these jeans I think I was hoping
for them to be a little bit closer down
to bottom a little bit more
tight-fitting I'm not sure if I'm going
to get enough for use out of them
because I don't know I'm not sure if I
can pull off this slightly wider look
but let me know what you guys think what
can I wear them with footwear wise I
know I'm a little bit stumped definitely
need your opinion on these so let me
know then I went in for a classic piece
this is just a pink t-shirt from the
boutique range I believe yeah Topshop
boutique and it's basically just a pink
t-shirt but I wear t-shirts all the time
as you guys know this is my favorite
color there's really nothing terribly
special about it it is finished quite
well on all the hems it's obviously got
some kind of bonded materials it's quite
a solid hem and the same on sleeves I
think this is like that iron-on material
that just stiffens the hem so you've got
quite a quest of hem on these sleeves on
the base and again I think just like
tucked into jeans or worn with
high-waisted trousers this will look
really really lovely next we're moving
on to the bigger bag it definitely feel
there's at least two shoeboxes in here I
only made this order about a week ago
but I can't properly remember what I
ordered so let's have a little look
inside I don't even know where start
okay so the first thing inside very well
wrapped up is a pink satin bomber jacket
and I as you guys know I'm not very cool
I don't really go very like gangster
when it comes to my outfits but I
thought if any bomber jacket is going to
work on me it's going to be a pink satin
one so here it is it's actually kind of
more dial-up than I was expecting the
shape is a little bit Michelin Man but
this is quite interesting and well I
just I just have no words so I'm just
going to give it a try okay so first of
all I am absolutely roasting this is a
very very warm jacket also I can't help
but feel like I look like a bit of a tip
wearing this it's just so big it's
literally like you've wrapped a pillow
around your body it is incredibly
comfortable and I'm sure it'd be super
warm in winter but I just don't know I
do like the fact that it's like
double-breasted so you'd be seriously so
snuggly warm but I'd also worried about
getting mud on it because this is lovely
pink satin material I think it's quite a
cool piece and I can definitely
appreciate it
but I'm not sure it's right for me sorry
Topshop next is a pair of shoes and
comment oh these are really cute these
are really cute look at these so they
are metallic pink once again metallic
accessories really coming in and they
have this detail at the front not really
sure how you describe this is almost
like a fringing detail with a buckle and
these are very Gucci so Gucci have
obviously bought out a load of shoes of
this style this season and this heel
height for me is just absolute fabulous
I think I mentioned it in a video a
little while ago that girls actually
were not designed to wear flat shoes we
are designed pelvis wise to wear short
heels so these are absolute perfect
these will look really cute with the
frayed hand trousers hopefully if not
just with white jeans I think I look
absolutely gorgeous I adore the color
and I'm praying music
be comfortable oh my gosh guys I love
these so much and so much more than what
I was expecting to love them they're
surprisingly comfortable they're really
snug fit so once again I'm going to wear
these around the house today see how
they kind of molds my feet but I think
that these could be a really good one
for like when you need to wear
closed-toe shoes it's getting a bit
cooler but you're just not ready for
boots and hopefully they become clean
enough for all day long wear because I
don't know my feet feel really like
comfortable in them and a really good
heel height too they're not too high
what do you guys think oh it looks so
much like Gucci I just I'm obsessed
and the color look just love them ah
nice one Topshop next is another pair of
shoes let's see what these ones are like
oh oh oh these are something else
look how bead or they look really big
they are size three
these are 82 pounds so actually fairly
pricey but then when it comes to autumn
winter don't know about you but I wear
boots like they are like my staple
Footwear I always really struggle when
it comes to not wearing open-toed shoes
anymore like that day when suddenly it's
so cold that you just have to close your
toes I find that quite hard I'm
definitely an open toe shoe person in
summer and so I thought this would be a
nice like transition I really look
forward to wearing these because they're
so beautiful
they've got a rose gold heel as you can
see and then they're a beautiful taupe
color and they've got a an elastic bit
here so should be nice and snug to the
foot really good heel height just enough
to give you a flattering little boost
but still being easy to walk in so I
think again with white jeans or even
just like normal denim jeans this is
going to look so stunning and I have a
feeling these are going to be like the
kind of boots that you're going to see
me wearing over and over and over and
over again all over my Instagram's so I
apologize in advance for food spam I
cannot even explain to you how hard it
was to get this on my foot hence why I'm
only wearing one but yeah maybe because
my feet is so hot and they've like
swelled I don't know but this was so
hard to get on hopefully the shoe
born with socks very much easier but
that aside I'm in love they are so
beautiful I think with these trousers as
well and white jeans it could be really
cute I don't know what else to style
them with actually if you've got any
styling ideas let me know but the heel I
just love yeah I think these are
absolutely beautiful and I think I'll
wear these a lot in the autumn months
what else I think the last thing is
another pair of shoes
oh these are gorgeous okay so my final
shoe purchase from Topshop are these
rose gold mules so these are pretty much
what I had in mind when I picked up
these houses with the flared hand I
think these all look so stunning there's
such a lovely statement piece and what I
like about this kind of material is it
it's almost spongy so it's gonna be
hopefully really really comfortable nice
and leg-lengthening flattering again
really good heel sides walkable but also
very very flattering I do also think
that this color will go with quite a lot
in my wardrobe hopefully I'll be able to
wear it with skirts as well as just with
jeans but yeah I'll be interesting to
style these up in a few different ways
these were 52 pounds so not cheap but I
actually think if you get a lot of use
out something like this that 52 pounds
for a pair of good shoes is not too bad
and I did get student discount as well
so I got 5 pounds off so actually around
47 pounds so not horrendous at all but
I'll try these on with a few different
outfits just to make sure I have enough
options for wearing them so cute I
absolutely adore these the color is just
beautiful I think the heel height is
actually surprisingly wearable they feel
really comfy so I'm going to wear them
around the house today and I will let
you know how I get on but first
impressions love them so that's
everything from Topshop and now I'm
going to move on to River Island I'll
start off with the bag the one that
literally just got delivered seeing as
we're talking about shoes I'll start off
with a pair of riding shoes and these
are oh my god this is hilarious these
are so similar to the Topshop ones
funny is that I think it's so Larry's
when retailers like have very very
similar things but just proves that they
are going to be on trend these have a
much lower heel and a lot more if we
just compare the two
so River Island Topshop Topshop ones
this fit goes up much higher across the
foot they're a little bit squishier
whereas these are slightly thinner
leather lower heel so probably more easy
to walk in and considering the shoe
style I think this might be more
practical I will try them both on and
let you know so here we've got I'm
wearing the Topshop shoes and the river
island ones they are so similar I just
oh I just don't know which ones I prefer
so obviously the Topshop ones are higher
these revealin ones I think maybe I'll
get more use out of them what do you
think help me out guys I really don't
know
next remover island is a piece that I
know I'm going to get so much use out of
and it is a grey duster jacket so you
may remember a little while ago I've got
the light pink one from River Island and
I wore it to death I still adore it but
as we move into autumn I think that pink
is probably slightly more the springtime
color and gray could potentially take me
into autumn so I chose this one it is
actually a really lovely lightweight
material so I could wear it in these
warmer months still but yeah I will give
it a try and you can see how it looks
like
okay so I've put on a jumper to try this
on although I don't really need to it
does feel quite tight on the arms of the
jumper so I feel like maybe this will be
better with lightweight things like
t-shirts but I love it I think the
colour it's just perfect I really like
these side slits as well you've got
these tie details down the sides
you've got the turned up cuffs which I
really like just makes it a little bit
more casual and yeah I can see myself
wearing this a lot so I think this is
definitely a keeper what do you guys
think let me let me know and then we
have something incredibly wintery I just
could not resist this because I know
these kind of things they do sell out
and as ironic as it sounds buying coats
this time of year it is the best time to
get the best ones ahead of the winter
season and this from River Island I just
I just love at first sight
just so beautiful it's a gray suede
material or maybe it's kind of like
sheepskin effect and then you've got
this Mongolian fur collar and it's like
a waterfall collar beautiful fur on the
inside obviously not real fur and it
just feels so lovely and soft I can
imagine myself wearing this a heck of a
lot when it gets to autumn winter I'll
probably do a lookbook or styling video
guy love wearing jeans a long-sleeved
top or jumper and then to keep me warm
a lovely easy lay so I will give this a
try I will grouse that is commitment to
the cause but I'll give us a try so you
can see what it looks like on love love
love love love I am already obsessed
with this and I cannot wait to the
weather to get cooler so I can wear it
just love how this falls in the middle
edge dutiful waterfall effect and I
really like you've got right on the
edges as well so you can see it coming
through
inside it's just so snuggly where you
haven't got the Mongolian fur you've got
this like faux fur inside just so lovely
in soft and I like with this kind of
thing it keeps your body warmer your
arms still free to like you know do
stuff and you don't overheat in Judaism
as your body is kept nice and warm I
just know I'm gonna wear this so much
you can even wrap a little better on the
middle I just absolutely love it
and finally we move on to the river
island carry a bag so I can already see
a shoebox so let's start with those oh I
forgot how excited I was about these how
beautiful are these oh my gosh they're
really actually not my style and not
something I would normally go for but I
could not resist that I mean they look
so designer they just they don't look
like anything that I've ever seen on the
high street before I don't really wear
this style of shoe very much either the
slip on style but whether they fall off
my feet will not find determined to make
these work I just think now beautiful
you've got this almost Chinese e
embroidery on it beautiful gold buckle
tiny little heel I know that I'm going
to get so many questions about where
these are from
and people are not going to believe me
so they River Island so excited to wear
these you're going to be seeing these a
lot a lot a lot guys
I love them they could not be more
perfect and they're super comfy as well
I'm already just so so excited to wear
these I think they look really cute with
these like tassel trousers as well
literally obsessed oh love love love
love love and also how expensive do they
look I feel like they look like Gucci
love love love what is in here who
remember this okay so this is another
thing but I'm going to get a lot of use
out of I wear these kind of straps all
the time in fact I'm probably going to
leave this on after I try it on for you
guys later
it's just a beautiful blush pink color
with quite interesting strap detail so
you've got this almost like t-bar at the
back which is just a really nice unusual
detail as opposed to a normal v-neck
there's a slight bit of detail here with
those um on the neckline I don't know if
you can see those two of the types of
material or it's just sewn in a
different direction which gives it a
little bit of difference so once again
I'll give these a try as you can see how
it looks so the fit on this top is
actually a little bit looser than I was
expecting it's quite flowy around the
waist but I don't really mind that to be
honest as I said I'll probably tuck it
in a lot of the times in which case I'll
just give it a really nice flow to it
love the back I really like the t-bar
effect I just think it's really just a
little bit more unusual than most
v-necks
color wise I love it I think even when
I'm not hand it'll still look good and
yeah it's not expensive and it's
basically a wardrobe essential and I'm
probably going to pick this up in a few
more colors if I'm totally honest I'm
pretty sure they have a white one and if
they have a gray I might pick up a gray
so definitely keeping this and
definitely going to look for some more
and last but not least the piece de la
resistance and also the most wintry
thing in the whole world is this amazing
coat slash cake from River Island it's a
beautiful I think it's faux suede but
I'm not hundred cents short could be
real suede and I actually fell in love
with a river island cake last year but I
was too slow off the mark and I missed
it there were no sizes of my size left
anywhere last year so I've gone in super
super early this year and it's beautiful
tan color which just goes with
everything and then you've got this
Mongolian fur again just love the love
the curly Mongolian fur around the neck
so this is going to be so snuggly
beautiful gold zip detail zipper pockets
here although I probably won't put
anything in those it might ruin the flow
but once again really hard to show you
like this so I'm going to give it a try
I think I do actually like this quite a
lot when it's undone it's definitely a
lot more like easy breezy the arm slips
come up to a really nice height so while
it is still a cape you still have a
movement of your arms which is great in
fact I'm pretty short all cakes do this
so it'd be a bit weird if you like start
within your cape so maybe that's not a
valid point but yeah so let's see what
it looks like done up I also really like
the hardware on this I think the gold
looks really nice
and so yeah what do you guys think I can
imagine this being the sort of thing
that I'm going to have to make myself
wear because I don't know I think it's
such a great statement piece but it's so
easy to choke on your coat whereas maybe
during Fashion Week this will come in
quite handy because it is quite a
statement piece but I just love this for
love the hardware and I definitely want
to wear this a lot in the car and that
is everything from my recent calls from
Topshop and River Island I really hope
you guys enjoyed looking through these
with me and maybe it's given you some
shopping inspiration as we move towards
that time where no one's really sure
whether to buy summer stuff or autumn
stuff but I think that all these pieces

next couple of months let me know as
