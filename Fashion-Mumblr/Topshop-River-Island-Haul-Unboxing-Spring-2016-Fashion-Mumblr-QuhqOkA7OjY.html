really fab day thank you so much for
joining me for another haul video I
posted one earlier this week which was
an Asus Ted Baker and French Connection
haul and this time I'm going through the
bits and bobs which I picked up from
Topshop and River Island as I said in
the last haul this time of year is my
favorite time of year when it comes to
shopping because I just love when all
the spring trends start coming in I love
to buy the pastels florals the laces
it's all just so me so this is
definitely my most spendy time of year
so they'll probably be a few more hauls
coming your way as well and you guys
seem to really really love them so I
thought I would share with you the bits
that I picked up from Topshop and River
Island recently I think it was actually
only about three weeks ago that I did my
last Topshop rivai in kind of Zara Hall
but the spring drop has really started
to happen now so there are just so many
more pieces I want to pick up plus as I
mentioned in the last video I am going
to be in Hong Kong right now when you're
watching this video and I'm going to
filming a bit of a lookbook video while
I'm out there so a lot of these things
were purchased with that in mind before
we get started on the haul I wanted to
give a quick shout out to my nails which
are this really crazy quite unusual teal
color and this is because March is a
very in Cancer Awareness Month and Barry
M who created this nail varnish have
teamed up with ovarcome which is a
charity for ovarian cancer and they're
going to be giving away 50% of the sales
of this green berry jelly nail polish to
the ovarian cancer charity if you buy
from viacom so that is why I'm wearing
this bright color on my nails it's 399
50% of profits go to charity so yeah if
you want to support that charity then
head down to the baryon website to get
the nail polish so with the bits that I
bought I literally have not even opened
up the packages yet and
I think I've had these sitting in my
room for about four days now so I can't
quite remember what's inside I have a
really bad memory when it comes to
shopping so this is going to be a bit of
a first impressions haul video I'm
actually not going to do the trying on
part for this video because I am
planning on doing it that lookbook video
when I'm in Hong Kong so if you want to
see what these items look like on or at
least a bit so I'm planning on keeping
it then check out that video which will
be gonna go away very soon so I'm gonna
start with Topshop I'm going to open
this up as I said I can't fully remember
what's inside in fact I couldn't even
tell you one item that's inside so this
is going to be as much of a surprise for
me as it is for you so let's have a look
okay we have lots of pinks and grays
which does not surprise me alright so
the first thing that is inside my
Topshop parcel also I love that they
come on coat hangers just makes my life
so much easier
is this like geometric design top and
firstly I have to mention the fabric
it's a really thick fabric it's
definitely quite structured material I'm
going to see what fabric it is yeah so
this is 100% polyester which I know it's
a cheap kind of man-made fabric but I
feel like it really does have a lot of
the properties of silk this is almost
like quite a thick kind of dupioni silk
feel and but yeah it's a lovely thick
fabric as I said before it's got exposed
seams which I think gives quite a cool
kind of East London as far as East
London that I can go and industrial kind
of feel to it and then it's quite I'm
not sure if you can see but there's
quite an angle here so they'll be
protesting to see how that looks when
it's on and for this reason because it
does have this pokey kind of side I
actually went down a size so I've picked
up a size 4 in this which still looks
pretty big actually um one detail which
I do UPS in love is this zip which is
rose gold and if you saw my haul the
last one I did you'll know that I'm just
obsessed with these little rose gold
details on the Ted Baker things so this
has got that rose gold detail I think it
is actually not Topshop boutique but an
exclusive collection of luxury designs I
guess that's just like Topshop slightly
higher end label but yeah really nice
fabric and really nice colors it's got
this lush pink Arisa
I blew and then this is almost between
like a mustard and a greeny lime color
so really really pretty and I think this
will be a nice thing to wear in spring
just just with some white jeans
similarly geometric is this jumper and
you can see it's grey and then you've
got this big bold strip of like a navy
ribbon and then it goes into pink on the
bottom half a really really relaxed
loose fit this is definitely gonna be
quite oversized again I picked up the
size 4 because I knew that this is just
going to be absolutely ginormous I mean
even this for a size 4 you can see it's
really huge so this is definitely gonna
be a loose fit again you've got these
exposed seems a little bit of fraying
going on there which just gives it a
really cool touch a really well for a
jumper it's a light fabric it's
definitely not a knitted jumper so
really good for spring time of year
again with white jeans I think that's
all look really really classic I might
even travel in this jumper there's
almost 46 pounds so I really need to
make sure that this suits me and it's
because it's quite a bold pattern it's
going to be quite memorable
so yeah that's worth considering you've
got to spend 46 pounds on a jumper the
final piece that I picked it up from
Topshop is this little vest top in this
lovely kind of dusty blue color and you
can see along the back you've got these
two strap details which this gives it a
bit of a bit of an interesting touch
compared to a normal camisole I've told
you guys so many times that these sort
of tops in really neutral colors whether
it's white or grey or black or even this
lovely blue color
they just make such great wardrobe
staples I find that this kind of design
I find myself picking out my wardrobe
time and time again when it comes to
spring and summer and this was only 16
pounds so I will definitely be keeping
my eye on any other colors and
definitely stocking up on any other
colours I definitely want to get white
one in this design I'm surprised I
didn't actually pick one out maybe I
thought this was white but I think this
blue it's a really lovely color if
you're blonde or if you've got like an
only the skin tone then I think it's
just such a gorgeous flattering color
and it doesn't look like the V is too
low sometimes I have to shorten the
straps because they just hang too low
and I've got quite a small upper body
area but these look like the
traps are nice and short and it's also
double layers so you've got this almost
silky top layer to it and then another
layer underneath which just is a really
nice design detail especially for
something that's very 16 pounds so I'm
really really pleased with that and I'm
gonna go on top that website soon as I
finish filming this and see if they've
got any more colors okay next is River
Island and again I have always to not
open this before so we're going to do a
real first impressions book got quite a
lot of islands okay looking over this I
do not remember buying any of this that
might have been a late night splurge
judging by that decision but quite a few
pieces according to the receipt so let's
have a little look okay so these ones
didn't come with coat hangers so I've
just grabbed some of mine from my
wardrobe so I can show you a little bit
better and the first thing that I've
picked up from River Island is this
lovely long line pink duster coat now
you may have seen my Fashion Week videos
where I wore the river island kind of
knit material coat which sold out
annoyingly
and loads of you guys wanted to know
where it's from a regatta that you can
find it so this we have little
readjustment and this one I picked up is
almost like an alternative to that I
absolutely love the color of this this
blush pink is so me and it's that same
shape so you've got the waist tie which
makes it nice and flattering and a
really nice really nice length so it's
quite a long coat you've got slits on
the side you've got a little side pocket
detail here as you know that stitched up
so it's not a real pocket but that will
just ruin the shape of the coat anyway
and a much lighter fabric so really
really lovely fabric for springtime
this was sixty pounds which I don't
think is too bad for spring coats and
it's got really nice details but I
suppose stitching there you've got some
turned up hems and just the most
beautiful flattering color this is
definitely my favorite color when it
comes to elsewhere when it comes to most
fashion things to be honest so I foresee
myself getting a lot of use out of this
jacket from River Island next up is this
grey kind of shirt dress this is a
really classic design it's just almost
like a grey t-shirt with quite large
sleeves that these are
nice floating effect and then a deeper
v-neck again you've got a waist tie here
and it's a reasonably decent length
dresses that this is the downside to me
not trying on you can't really truly see
the length of this but as I said keep a
lookout for my lookbook video and this
one was 45 pounds a really lovely
classic piece I think this would be a
really nice spring work piece if you
work in an office and you don't like to
get too hot during the spring time I
think this is just a really lovely color
and a very classic shape the material is
quite unusual it's quite cotton II
definitely quite textured material so
it's a bit more unusual than your normal
kind of plain cotton fabric then we've
got quite an unusual piece this here is
a lace bomber jacket I kind of just saw
this and was intrigued to see how it
would look I thought especially when I
go to Hong Kong it'll be quite a nice
layering piece because you don't really
know I mean I don't really know what the
weather's like out there so it'd be nice
to take some layering pieces with me as
far as bomber jackets go I'm not cool
enough to pull them off but I thought
this lace one was just a really
beautiful design it's almost a little
bit Chanel ish I can imagine this being
a bit of a catwalk copycat but really
really beautiful I love the different
textures of the lace you've got two
different types of lace here and a
really nicely fringing detail across
that and across the shoulder area which
just gives it another little bit of
interest again this is only 45 pounds I
think that makes a really nice quite a
statement wardrobe Edition for 45 pounds
and the sort of thing that you can
really dress down maybe like a day dress
if you're going to many bases or polo or
anything like that or even just dressing
up but jeans and a t-shirt so I think
this is a really versatile piece and I'm
looking forward to starting this a few
different options in my wardrobe I saw
this t-shirt on the river island website
and I thought to myself I don't actually
own any really kind of fun statement
t-shirts and this one is just a really
really cute you've got this kind of
tassel detail here which obviously looks
like eyelashes and then you've got the
printed lips here but at the end of the
day it's just a plain white t-shirt but
I really like the look when you see
girls wearing cool t-shirts tucked into
high-waisted jeans so that's definitely
the look that I had in mind when I
picked up this t-shirt this twenty-two
pounds I think I'll get a lot of use
this weather just on quite casual days
in the UK or maybe when I'm on holiday
it'll be quite cool kind of beach outfit
it's very like Miami Beach kind of style
and I just thought it's really unusual
really quite fun and quirky so for 22
pounds I thought that's a really nice
one to pick up from her violence as well
and then this piece I picked it up
because I thought that when I wear this
it's going to look so much more
expensive than it actually was and this
is and it feels like real leather but
I'm pretty sure because the price tag
it's not going to be actual leather or
to say
yeah it's polyester and polyurethane but
I'm much happier that it's that than
leather because I don't even want to
think about how it could get leather in
this quantity so cheaply but this is a
really beautiful faux leather lovely
waterfall effect jackets and I just
think that for 60 pounds this looks so
so so much more expensive you've got
this gorgeous this really does look like
leather on the sleeves but then you've
got like an elastic section I'm not sure
if you can see but the inside of the
sleeves is like an elastic ATAR material
material which I hope means it's going
to have a really lovely fit to it and
then this lovely waterfall detail down
the middle you've got some zipping
pockets just so many nice design details
460 pounds and are really lovely unusual
outerwear piece for springtime so again
I think over like white t-shirt and
jeans all look absolutely gorgeous and
just such an unusual piece it's got
almost like tailoring at the back as
well really nicely fitted so I think
this is going to be something I get a
lot of use out of in a spring time and
another springtime wardrobe staple in
fact I think this is the piece that made
me want to make my river island order in
the first place this is a really lovely
white kind of vest top but you've got
this beautiful lace kind of cutout
detail here on the shoulders hopefully
you can see that that and then you've
got this cutout lace detail down the
middle as well as I said earlier this is
the kind of thing that I layer and I
wear all the time in springtime you've
got that same kind of detail along the
bot
it just makes a little bit more unusual
I absolutely love things like this
there's so pretty they're so cheap that
wardrobe basics this was 26 pounds and I
already know I will wear this so so so
much it's such a lovely lightweight
material again it feels silky but I'm
sure it's probably ester because of the
price tag I think this is absolute
gorgeous weather in the UK or on holiday
it's just one of those pieces that I
will wear and wear and wear so much
during the coming month so I'm really
really pleased with that one and this
piece was most definitely a holiday
inspired it's a white kind of linen
material along the top and then you've
got this almost tweed blue fabric for
the main part of it a little bit of a
side seam action going on there and then
you've got this lovely gold ribbon and
tassel detail at the pub just drop it a
lovely kind of tassel detail at the
bottom there which is similar to this
detail along at the bust area but this
fabric I thought was very like
Mediterranean quite Spanish it's Hallion
kind of feel to it and you've got this
lovely rose gold clasp at the back
another really nice design detail that I
really really love this one was 32
pounds that's again not that expensive
this I imagine myself wearing with denim
white denim in particular and some
wedges and like wedge sandals which will
just look really beautiful and summery
and this jumper just makes me want to go
on holiday so badly jump on top this
makes me want to go on holiday so badly
being on like a creek island or
something yeah this is makes me think of
summer speaking of summer the next
single I picked up is this little
crochet crop top now this is definitely
the kind of thing that I will appear ly
be wearing on a holiday I don't think I
can quite rock a crop top in the UK but
I know that crop tops and especially
crochet crop tops was so popular last
summer and I definitely foresee them
being just as popular this summer this
one is absolutely gorgeous just a really
beautiful shape you've got that kind of
crisscross detail at the back and I
really don't think Cara's gonna pick
this up but the tasseling at the bottom
and this tassel here is almost satin
even shimmery which is just such a
lovely detail whereas this is obviously
that plain kind of
crochet design and then you've got the
crochet straps up here this was this was
35 pounds it's actually when you think
about it it's quite a lot but then I
guess the amount of embroidery
embroidery the amount of detail that's
in this with this kind of crochet
material is you've got to pay for that
kind of detail at the end of the day but
I think over a bikini or maybe even a
strapless bra then just so cute for like
festivals or any early yea holidays
you've got planned or just kind of thing
you want to add into wardrobe now so
that when it comes to holiday time you
know that you've got a bit of a holiday
capsule wardrobe all ready to go
and the final two things I picked up
from River Island are a couple of pairs
of jeans and this pair is pure whites
and then this pair is off-white I
probably end up only keeping one
proteins because two is a little
excessive but the reason why I chose to
buy some jeans from River Island is
because river island jeans are such a
good fit especially if you're slightly
on the petite side if you do have a
slightly more slender legs then you'll
absolutely love river island jeans they
when they say skinny fit they really are
a skinny fit these are quite high
waisted the details are all silver on
these and then they are finished with a
normal hand and the reason why I say
those because I think the other ones
have got more of a ripped em detail but
I just tend to buy a pair of white jeans
at the beginning of each spring season
because you know they only ever really
last a season when you get marks on them
they start to go a little bit baggy so
this purchase will be my annual white
jeans purchase either those I will keep
all these ones as I said the off-white
ones these have got more bronze detail
again that they're high-waisted even
more high-waisted than the others quite
a short length because I chose the
petite style and then they have got more
of a rough finished end which I think I
prefer slightly and I think maybe I do
prefer the off-white color and
especially as the detail is bronze or
very near to rose gold so depending on
the fit I'm sure they'll both fit pretty
pretty soon early buy probably will end
up keeping this path ok sorry if the
camera angle is a little bit
and for this little clip but I had
actually finished filming and then I
found this under my pile and I thought I
would quickly insert the clip of me
talking about this one because this is
another of those really really classic
pieces I did in fact find a white tank
top or desk top and this is a beautiful
crappy kind of material so it feels a
little bit silky but it's got definitely
a load of texture to it which makes it
nice and unusual
you've got the thin straps at the front
and then hopefully you can see at the
back if I hold it up to my top here you
can see you've got that crisscross
detail which just gives it such an
unusual difference this was 14 pounds so
it's so worth stocking up on these for
the spring/summer season honestly I
cannot tell you how often an outfit can
be so easily completed with a white vest
top whether you just want to wear jeans
and just look really cute and casual or
you've got a nice high waisted pair of
shorts or apparent statement trousers
honestly these tops are so handy and
this was only 14 pounds so it's such a
great incredible value per wear piece
from River Island and that's everything
that I got from River islands and
everything that I picked up from Topshop
so not like a ginormous ginormous haul
but lots and lots of lovely pieces I'm
gonna try them on now and see which ones
fit and pack the ones that I love into
my suitcase for Hong Kong and as I said
when you're watching this I pretty will
be there so make sure you're checking
out why I'm up to over on my snapchat
and if you would like to see these items

haul and some other things that I've
