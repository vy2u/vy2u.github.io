channel I hope you're having a really
lovely day excuse me while I just
finished my cup of tea I'm at the
awkward stage where it's at that perfect
drinking temperature but I really wanted
to crack on with my video so I'm just
gonna have a little slurp while we while
we chat Charlie actually picked up this
mug solely with the purpose of
instagramming it and he thought it was
very Instagram herbal it's from this
person up in Scotland when we went to
Scotland nothing was open and pop from a
ceramics shop and yeah I decided to pick
up this mug and I have now adopted it so
win-win situation
today's video is basically going to be a
bit of a fashion haul I've been shopping
from a few different retailers recently
just picking up a few bits and bobs a
few transitional pieces as we move from
deepest darkest winter having a few
sunny days and moving into slightly
spring books yeah February so we're
definitely not into spring it but
basically some slightly lighter colors
some feel like I'm so done with dark
colors and real thick knitwear so I
thought I would share with you a few the
pieces that I've been buying mostly from
Topshop and River Island I think maybe a
couple of other retailers thrown in for
good measure
also if you're watching this video on
the day that it goes live it is slap
bang in the middle of Fashion Week so
with a few of these purchases I did of
course have Fashion Week in mind so they
are things which are probably wearing
cheering Fashion Week so I'm going to
get started with what I'm wearing it now
because otherwise I will completely
forget to tell you and the first thing
is this lace top so I picked this up
from you can see it's got kind of like
lace detail on the sleeves I picked this
up just this morning actually from Zara
got it from the Zara on Kings Road and
honestly there was so much stuff in
there that I really really really wanted
to buy but I managed to control myself
and ended up leaving with just this top
I thought this is a really beautiful
quite simple but very delicate and girly
top really nice to wear with jeans and
Carly wearing it with my dark
American Eagle jeans which i think looks
so so
so lovely together this I believe was
either 32 or 39 but I hopefully will get
a lot of wear out of this as we move
into spring time as well so very pleased
with this little bargain also not sure
if you can see them but these sunglasses
I picked these up from Topshop recently
but they are a brand called ki Australia
now ki is one of those brands that seems
to be like a bloggers what's the word of
bloggers dream they just are all over my
Instagram feed and I decided it's about
time that I treated myself to a pair
actually somehow I had it in my head
that they were a lot more expensive but
I think I paid maybe 25 pounds for these
and I really loved the kind of laser-cut
detail around the top just makes a
little bit more unusual but still that
cat eye shape which I absolutely love I
also made a bit of an online order with
Topshop I have opened up most of these
pieces I thought I would show you when I
got from Topshop calm and the first
thing is this lovely high-neck
long-sleeve pink jumper it's not a body
because it doesn't have the kind of
Clips around the crotch at the bottom
but instead it's just a very plain very
thin knit so really good for layering I
think it is going to be very tight
fitting so I would still call it a body
but the one thing I'm concerned about is
that it's quite sheer so I'm definitely
gonna have to be quite selective for the
underwear that I wear with this I
thought you're in Fashion Week or during
the rest of the kind of cooler months be
really nice to layer with maybe your
she'll a and maybe even like a cardigan
over the top I'm not sure I'm definitely
no experiment because those absolutely
love the color of this I think it's such
a such a beautiful very me color so
that's the first thing that I picked up
from Topshop second thing definitely
along the same lines is a plain light
pink wore edged t-shirt also from
Topshop so it's raw edge which means
that the seams haven't been finished
properly on the bottom so it's a very
kind of simple cut fabric nice easy way
of Topshop finishing off of the UM the
details and it's the same along the
bottom it's not going to fray because
it's been cut on the weft instead of on
the warp which basically means that the
fabric won't fray but you still get that
really kind of in
steel rough finish on the edges which
I'd really like this I believe is a
Topshop premium yeah Topshop boutique
which just a little tiny bit higher
quality and nicer design than the rest
of the store and I've picked up this
same kind of design t-shirt in parade
and maybe Navy and white before and I
know but I really like it such a classic
kind of style and yeah I obviously love
Pink's I thought I would treat myself to
the pink version not too pricey
considering its Topshop boutique this is
25 pounds and I think when I think about
the amount of time so I'm going to wear
this it's really really good of cost per
wear another really beautiful piece that
I picked up in my Topshop online order
is this shirt dress and it's a gorgeous
gray color I think it's a really
flattering color kind of universally
suits most skin tones most hair colors
and I've been on the lookout for a shirt
dress for quite some time I actually saw
one on Victoria from in the fro she went
to Paris and took a beautiful picture
wearing a Joseph's shirt dress now
joseph is slightly out of my budget at
the moment unfortunately but I've picked
up this beautiful one from Topshop with
the hope of kind of recreating a similar
look
I think I'll definitely wear this one
maybe if we have a warmer day during
Fashion Week fingers crossed with some
lovely heels it comes to a round knee
level which is great nice and flattering
on my short frame and then you've got
this tie waist and turned up sleeves
with this button here which keeps the
sleeves turned up it's not silk alike
I'm sure the Joseph's one was but it's a
really lovely light material and it
hangs really beautifully as well this
was 36 pounds which i think is a really
good price for a dress as I said
beautiful fit it definitely looks more
expensive than 36 pounds then you have
student discount they're like 33 or
whatever I think this is really really
good buy from Topshop and I think
a lot of use out of this especially as
you move towards a woman months as well
and if I see this in any other colors
then I definitely might be tempted to
treat myself to some brighter more
spring pastel colors as well maybe white
and pink as well
on a slightly different note but I
thought I would mention it I picked up
this lovely bra from Topshop
if you saw my genuine favorite favorite
favorite so you might have seen that I
featured something quite similar in that
from accessorize and I've really been
liking this style of undo I recently it
looks again more expensive than it is
this was 16 pounds but I feel like La
Perla from Proctor they have definitely
got loads of underwear start and
underwear pieces in this style at the
moment and I find it incredibly
comfortable this has got a racerback so
you can see it kind of separates out of
the back there which means if I wear
anything where my shoulders are a little
bit more revealed then this will be
really great for not having visible
straps accessory-wise from Topshop the
first thing I picked up was this bag now
it's a leather effect I don't believe
it's um properly hooks it was quite
cheap bag with this lovely disc in the
middle now this disc definitely has some
kind of Chloe X vibe about it but it's a
lovely spacious clutch bag with a
magnetic clasp and then you've even got
a little pocket in there as well I
thought the color of this was really
gorgeous I already have any past all
could clutch bags I know it's not
exactly like a necessity but I just
thought this was really beautiful and
I'm definitely planning on using this
with the grey shirt dress I think they
go quite nicely together the two colours
by the way the Lighting's going with us
because Dexter is currently chasing
around the bottom of my lighting stance
it might be flicking around but I
thought that was lovely combination a
nice pastel look for wearing it during
Fashion Week and Beyond and then the
last thing that I picked up from Topshop
and this is going back a little bit when
it comes to being wintery but I picked
up this really long really thick really
lovely long coat from Topshop now it's a
deep navy color really thick kind of
wool material and I thought this would
be great for those days where you do
want to have a lovely outfit on but you
don't want
you don't want to have to take off loads
and loads of layers if it's a freezing
cold day so this is great maybe even
with the shirt dress if this cooler day
but still sunny then I can just whip the
coat off when I get inside a fashion
show when I get inside the apartment or
something this ought to be a really
great cover-up but also keep me warm
when I'm dashing in between the shows
it's got a waist tie which means it's
still nice and flattering I can really
cinch it in at the waist and the length
I do find is quite flattering on myself
I'm not tall and probably like five foot
five or something so this length rather
than a full length coat
I do find quite flattering so that's it
for Topshop next I had a little splurge
in River Island and the first thing that
I picked up as this pair of jeans now
these are a lovely almost lilac e gray
color and they're that kind of waxy
finish so they don't feel like denim
they definitely feel like they've been
coated but I just thought the colour it
was really really lovely personally I'm
tired of just wearing normal kind of
denim so I thought that this kind of
coated denim in this lovely gray color
would be a really nice way of
transitioning my jeans style from winter
into spring I do feel really optimistic
talking about spring so much but I
definitely feel like we've been having
some nice sunny days recently and I'm
already starting to think about my
spring wardrobe so but this summer over
Ireland historically reviving jeans have
been a really good fit for me when you
true to size I picked up these in the
size six and I've already tried them on
and they do fit me really really nicely
a good length as well I got the shorter
length I find this some retailers I have
to read turn up the bottoms of the
trousers but these the length fits me
perfectly so a good tip for any of you
petite girls like myself River Island
jeans to do actually fit next I
purchased something a rather optimistic
from River Island basically I picked up
this bikini set I don't have any hot
holidays planned at the moment but
hopefully won't be too long in the in
the near future that I'll be going away
somewhere but this I just thought was so
so beautiful I hope you can see that
it's almost almost like a silky thread
detail over the top of the bus and it's
a bandeau style which for me because I
don't have particularly big boobs is
definitely the most flattering
still gives me quite a lovely
feminine shape and then at the bottoms I
thought were really really nice they
have a beautiful and that same kind of
detail along the top and the bottoms are
not too big so I hate it when you get
that really big bottom these are cinched
in to make them a little bit kind of
cheeky on the back and then type the
sides with these gorgeous little
embellishment details and then you've
got a little metal disc and a bead on
there as well which is just really
really pretty so I think these are going
to be a really really lovely set of
bikinis for me to wear on my next
holiday just need to get something
booked these are obviously very very
springy and not very wintry but I picked
up this pair of floral trousers also
from River Island in the size six I just
find that I often want to wear trousers
in spring maybe with a silk t-shirt or
just a lovely vest top and again that
denim routines just really won't do it
so I thought this is a really lovely
option for trousers that are something a
little bit different to denim really
love the floral design they're an always
kind of linen material which i think is
really lovely and light wine does start
to get warmer so really like these
trousers I also picked up another coat
from River Island which is this one here
and I picked this up for definitely that
kind of transitional period between
winter hello little one Texas come to
join us you guys haven't seen Dexter in
so long
I wonder if he's got any bigger since
you last saw him do you think you think
oh but you're going to go over there not
bothering us during the video so I
picked up this coat from River Island
because it's the exact same cut as my
gray one which not sure if I've actually
featured it that much but basically I
got this same code but in gray long line
kind of duster style and I wore that
coat absolute death it's pretty much all
bubbled and falling apart now and I
thought this round out kind of color
with this really textured material would
be a nice a nice
alternative to that one and equally I
think I'll get so much use out of this
because it's such a lovely material it's
really cozy but also a really nice fit
for just kind of shoving on and wrapping
yourself in when you just want to add a
little bit of warmth then I also picked
up this beautiful skirt from River
Island it's as asymmetric kind of design
in a faux suede material I thought again
quite kind of 1960s Chloe asked either
with black tights and boots or just bare
legs and maybe some sandals as it gets a
little bit warmer I really like all the
colors you've got this lush finger
terracotta and a baby pink
I thought absolutely gorgeous color
combination and a nice length as well
it's not too short so definitely a nice
one to wear maybe out shopping and if we
do have any warmer days during Fashion
Week then maybe I'll bring this out for
that as well and then potentially to
wear with that skirt or with any other
skirts that I might wear in the
foreseeable future I also picked up
these boots from River Island now these
were actually on the you might also like
section which normally I don't even
really look at on a website but River
Islands suggested that I might also like
these and I did they're a beautiful and
very light brown beige color with a
lovely chunky heel which means I can be
super easy to walk in with gorgeous
little tassels and you've got this kind
of wraparound detail here they were 75
pounds which i think is quite a lot from
River Island boots and but I'm going to
try this on with a few outfit
combinations to see how well they
working with my existing water because
obviously I want to get as much use out
of these as possible and then the last
thing that I wanted to show you which is
actually from Miss Selfridge I believe
yeah miss Selfridge is this pair of very
light kind of denim II effect linen
cloths so I knew that was a load of
words thrown in all together but I just
thought these are an absolutely
beautiful color and fit and design and I
tried these on actually my snapchat and
so many of you tweeted being like wow
they're really really lovely can't
believe that from Miss Selfridge and I
couldn't either I think they're
absolutely gorgeous they fit really
high-waisted Lee so really nice and leg
if you've got shorter legs like I have
been a really great way of creating the
illusion of longer legs again with the
whole material that isn't denim but it's
still very wearable something that I
think I've been getting a lot of use out
of in springtime and these price tag 39
pounds so a really nice cheap
alternative to a good pair of denim
trousers was still very very very
wearable with silk t-shirt or a tank top
or a gray vest top I think you look
absolutely gorgeous and I can't wait to
start wearing these in the springtime
and that's it those are the pieces that
I have been treating myself to recently
as I said when I was on Kings Road this
morning I just found so many shops had
loads and loads of lovely pieces so I
definitely think I'll be doing a little
bit more shopping now that the seasons
are starting to change and we start and
see those spring trends coming into the
shops this little man is being a very
needy and attention-seeking so I'm going
to take him for a little walk now but I
hope you guys enjoyed that video and
