the main prize I see you've got that
lovely big set and the box itself is
just beautiful and then I've got a mary
kay blusher so this is like a mini
compact little blusher in there a nice
big you could use this as maybe like a
foundation brush or a powder brush
somewhere brand called doll ten and then

today's prize i'm actually gonna do this
on my blog so what you've got to do is
just go and check out the latest blog
post which is a gift guide and in there
you'll see a little Rafflecopter and
just fill that out to win that so i'll
leave a link down below so good luck
guys to win the full set back from the
post office now i'm sorry there's a blog
seems a little bit bitty like them going
here i'm going
back from eeeh and so I'm just gonna
show you a little bit of some haulage
some stuff which is described in the
post there was this I don't think you
can really tell the magnitude at the
size nut box from that little clip so if
you compare the box to the size of my
room our room isn't that big that fills
it and that I will do next but first I'm
going to do a little a sauce a mini haul
because I was looking on ASOS a little
while ago for some Christmas dresses and
I bought quite a few to choose from I
don't have to have to try them on so I'm
going to our mums in a second but I'm
going to hang them all up and you guys
can help me decide which one's okay so
here are the four dresses I think I know
already which one I like the most and so
let's start with this one I think that
all the same brand I'm sure they're all
no they're not okay so this one here
this black lace one is by self-portrait
it's probably going to come to around
the mid-shin area so quite a long one
and I really like how it's like black
lace was still really delicate with
these nice thin straps
I think this detail here I'm not sure if
you can see it it's clear here
I think that'll look really lovely three
depends on the length if that's gonna be
flattering on me or not
but yeah that's really really cute and a
nice little V down at the back so that's
option number one I'll leave links for
these down below so you guys can chop
them if you really really like them this
one I'm really not too sure on so this
pink one
I believe it's a sauce own brand and but
it was getting a little bit stuck
together here make them a material you
can see the gold is kind of flaking away
a little bit
so yeah not too sure about that one but
there's a kind of full-length version of
it this one here I think is my favorite
it's white it's kind of t-shirt style at
the top with this kind of beautiful
little crochet but then there's a bando
on the boob area
a little free kind of top and then
around the waist you've got this almost
like little lace
tutu and then a beautiful little lace
with almost like a daisy print on the
skirt I think the length and the shape
of that one is just gorgeous and then
this is very similar to the black one
but in white in fact I think it's pretty
much the same strange choice and so
again you've got the clear section and
it's a lovely lovely elegant length but
I think this is just a little bit too
summery I might try it on if I fall in
love with it then keep it but otherwise
I think this is the winner this is about
as far as I can get with bringing the
other box into the room so I'm gonna
leave it there and unpack it and then
bring everything onto the bed to show
you what is inside okay so I just want
to apologize right now if you're
expecting something very unfashionable
or beauty related this is not it's
actually a load of really useful home
stuff I'm going to show you anyway
because you know we all need home stuff
so my wonderful selection of products
here is from TK Maxx I absolutely love
getting home stuff from TK Maxx they
have really good brands but you don't
have to pay an absolute fortune for them
I think these pillows should have been
over a hundred pounds for a pair but I
didn't even pay much more than 100
pounds for all of this stuff so let's
start with the pillows the pillows in
this room this is our kind of spare
bedroom are so embarrassingly flat I
just apologize profusely for anybody's
staying here so it's time to get some
nice pillows these this is a really
amazing brand and it was quite literally
about 75% off which is crazy so got some
duck feather and down pillows and like
straight away tomorrow morning I'm gonna
swap these monkey ones for this lovely
set so ya got the pillows then as you
can see got a rather ginormous dog bed
so Dexter has a really big cage
downstairs and but it's almost too big
and we don't wanna go buying another
cage so I thought forgot a really big
dog bed then it'll make it really cozy
in there for him
and this is almost like a beanbag for
dogs so it's got this zippy are what I
said I think this is a brand Live Love
bark that's really cute and yeah it's
got a removable cover so if he has the
accidents and that's fine so yeah really
big dog bed I think he's gonna
absolutely love this then we got a
snuggle down of Norway that sounds
rather fancy thermo Phil duvet so these
are these really fancy ones that they
don't make you too hot and oh me too
cold they're basically like temperature
regulating and again that's for this
bedroom here because the bedding I think
I must have got around the students and
thinks it's so knife and just
embarrassing for anybody that stays here
this again was more than half price I
would never be able to afford such a
fancy do you vote for my spare room and
but ttmx had a really good offer so got
the duvet I wonder how many of you as
I've lost already by talking about all
this kind of home stuff but then I've
got a double do they set the one I've
got the moment is from hmm and it's just
not the best quality so I've got this
one it's a brand called I think is like
bellow something or maybe hotel 21 is
the brand and so this is just a bottom
sheet and then I got a Bella luxe top
sheet it's just quite plain with like a
lacy
detail on the edges and the matching
pillowcases so that's pretty much like
the full bedding so got a bedding duvet
and the pillow so pretty much this
entire bed sorted and then last but not
least I got another little outfit for
Dexter because he genuinely gets pretty
cold in the winter so it's nice to give
him something to wear just get this out
and show you this is actually too cute
so you've got this little like kind of
Santa's hat here this is a picture of
the dog wearing it dice is not gonna
look anything like that and then it's
always like a father Christmas but a
green version and then he's got his
scissors it's hammers that candy cane oh
my gosh it looks quite big so might have
to like take it in a little bit how
bloody adorable is that I love it so
yeah that is
my little mini TK Maxx Hall really
pleased with all the bargains that I got
and as I said I think I probably spent
about 120 pounds and although this and
the dog bed so ya did pretty well thanks
TK Maxx and now I'm just gonna quickly
edit the thumbnail for the vlog that's
going live in about an hour and then I'm
gonna head off to Mom's house alright
video thumbnail done I'm now gonna head
out to Mom's house I'm gonna leave the
camera behind because I've already got
too much stuff to carry so gonna film on
the iPhone it wasn't too bad the other
day so see you later so we've just come
to one of my mom's friends house and I
have a little special guest here amazing
and show and really what you're wearing
so mazes go on the jacket
your name's meeting and who has you got
down there
Dexter is he behaving mithya is being
dragged around the house
so mums friends houses literally got the
best Christmas decorations ever look at
the argo behind me and all the
decorations above it it's amazing for
any washing her mouth out with soap

silicon
