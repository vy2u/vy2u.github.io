me for today's video which is going to
be a vlog style blogger male slash P o
box unboxing we went to our doddle this
morning after about a week to ten days
of not going down there so as you might
be able to see from this ginormous piled
to the corner of me we do have quite a
lot of lovely deliveries to unbox I have
spotted packages from beauty brands from
fashion brands there's even a few home
bits thrown in for good measure and some
really really exciting looking
deliveries so grab yourself a hot drink
do as I do because this could be a very
long one and without further ado let's
get started
so this first blogger mail is from Erin
and this came directly to the house I
have actually already had a look inside
this and it is a fabulous one to start
off such a beautiful delivery it is
their hibiscus palm new Oda path um and
also their body lotion I'm a huge huge
errand fan so I couldn't resist waiting
to try this out and after my bath this
morning I covered myself in this and
then also spritz myself with the
fragrance so I can already tell you that
I love it it's very fresh for this time
of year it's just absolutely beautiful I
adore all Erin packaging it's so
stunning and the way that it was
presented in this box filled with fresh
flowers is just absolutely stunning I'm
not sure if I can say that any of these
if I can make them look pretty in my
house anyway but it's just absolute
beautiful so thank you very much Erin I
will leave links to all the products
that I mention this video down below so
you can shop them if you want to some of
them may be new launches they may not
quite be out yet but I'll leave all that
information down in the description box
my second delivery is from a fashion
brand it's Karen Millen and I've been
working with Karen Millen on some
content creation over the past few weeks
and months so they have sent me a couple
of new pieces to try out so let's have a
little look what's inside the first
thing is this pair of boots and I
actually wore these on the day that I
went to the caramel and head office to
do some filming absolutely fell in love
with how comfortable they were and they
are a really good joob of the Balenciaga
sock foods which are everywhere at the
moment feel like they are very
flattering style because the sock effect
makes them really tight to your legs so
they look fabulous with cropped trousers
you can wear them with tights you can
wear them with
skirts and things like that very very
versatile boot styles that you will be
seeing me wearing a lot of these this
next one to me is kind of the perfect
winter to spring work dress or the kind
of dress you can wear in your wardrobe
if you've got meetings or if you just
want to look nice and smart I love
dresses that are this knitted material
but it's not standard jumper dress shape
because it's a beautiful fit on the
bodice and then flare out on the skirt I
think I would wear this potentially with
black tights and black boots like the
boots I showed you earlier or bare legs
and maybe flat shoes loads of different
ways you could style this and because
it's plain black at the top it would
look really lovely with a statement
necklace Karen Millen are kind of my
go-to when it comes to work wear pieces
that I want to look really professional
in but still show my personality they're
not just bland shirts and trousers
they're really stylish pieces that are
very very appropriate for the office so
you'll be seeing me wearing this in
upcoming photos upcoming videos so stay
tuned for that this is another one of
those pieces that I'll put in my
wardrobe and I know I will get so much
wear out of
they are Karen millons faux leather
leather leggings but what I love about
these is that you've got the leather
effect on the front I don't think it's
real leather but then on the back they
are elastic which means amazing fit
there's nothing worse than spending
loads of money on leather trousers and
then because they're leather all the way
around they just don't fit you perfectly
so because these are elastic at the back
that's so comfy and they fit like a
dream again I wore these if you watch my
outfit Diaries too
Monday's ago you'll see me wearing these
when I went to be Cameron head office to
do some filming this next one from Karen
Millen is their suede skirt and I
absolutely love suede skirts I wear them
so much they are definitely part of my
wardrobe essentials and this is the one
that has been just released on the Karen
Millen websites or a zip detail at the
front to zippy pockets and then a button
detail for the closure as well it's a
really versatile sound color so I can
definitely wear this with lots of my
cream-colored knits lots of silk
t-shirts when it comes to springtime
once again this will be a piece that I
get loads and loads of wear out of so I
don't actually think I can contain
myself any longer I need to open up this
delivery from mulberry I do actually
know what is inside because I chose this
myself but oh my goodness I am so
excited to see this I've not even had a
peek so this is a
first impressions unboxing inside the
carrier bag we have this dust bag says
mulberry England on the front you guys
know that I used to work up more very a
long time ago so before I was blogging
it was my first kind of job outside of
uni so it's a very very special brand to
me it is a brand that I have always
adored and it was my first and second
and third and I think full of designer
purchase were all from mulberry so to be
working with them again is an absolute
dream come true so let's have a look oh
my goodness
the color you guys can see already the
color is so perfect oh here it is oh my
goodness my new baby this is the
Bayswater the redesigned Bayswater i
think you guys would have seen my
original base water if you watched my
designer handbag collection video and
that was my first ever designer bag this
is the updated base water and the color
it looks a little bit more Brown in fact
it looks very Brown on the video but in
fact it is a rose color it's like a
blush-colored brownie pink and oh don't
if you couldn't tell my voice is like
quivering because I'm so excited right
now the detail is yellow gold you've got
the postman lock which we all know and
love mulberry for at the front here but
you don't need to worry about opening
and closing the lock because really it's
just there for show but this bag and the
reason why I chose this one is because
it's very very secure if you live in
London then you really should have a zip
closure or a flap closure on your
handbag this Bayswater does have a big
zip closure I wanted this to be my
everyday handbag and I do carry a lot of
things around with me on a daily basis I
nearly always have my laptop with me if
I'm spending the day out of the house
then I'll leave my laptop with me as
well as camera equipment notebooks
pocket of water makeup bag things like
that so for me this is a really really
perfect size and of course very secure
so I've taken all the stuffing out so
you can see how spacious it is inside
just like the original base water it's
like the raw back of the leather inside
it's not lined which is absolutely fine
because the back the flipside of the
leather is very very durable
the only other detail inside
handbag is this little envelope pocket
that's not zipped up but it's no big
issue because a whole bag as I said it's
really really secure actually two zips
that kind of meet in the middle but I
guess you could just pull one of them
all the way over and then you can tuck
the little zips back inside fits over
the shoulder it's actually a really
really spacious day bag I'm a very happy
lady and you guys are gonna be seeing
this a lot in my upcoming vlogs and my
Instagram stories and my outfit photos
so prepare to see a lot of this baby
well for sure nothing is going to quite
live up to that but let's continue I
have lots of little envelopes which I
think are new beauty launches this one
is from Clinique and inside I think this
is a little turmeric booster I'm
obsessed with turmeric at the moment
whether I'm ingesting it or putting it
on my face so that's amazing and this is
their seven-day fresh press system with
pure vitamin C to brighten and even the
complexion this is the kind of thing
that we all need at this time of year as
I'm filming this the weather is so gray
and that does horrible things to my skin
along with central heating and being
cold outside for this is the daily
booster to combat that it says vitamin C
is a single most searched nutrient on
the internet it's necessary for the
production of collagen which helps give
the skin its firmness and tone it
improves the appearance and texture of
skin so I guess the main use of this is
anti-aging but also has all of those
additional benefits for the skin fresh
means power
this is seven-day D aging system power
vitamin C to refresh and renew so again
keep an eye on my Instagram stories
because that's where I will trial things
like this if you're not following on
Instagram its Josie LDN keep an eye on
my stories and also my highlights
because that's where I'll save first
impressions and using new products like
this one
oh that's good next up is one of my home
items and this one is from Phillips it's
called they're some near sleep and wake
up lights now this is an example of very
clever PR because I actually tweeted a
couple of days ago only maybe like a
week ago that's I was really struggling
not struggling to wake up but every
morning Charlie's phone and Charlie
Scentsy along on his phone it would make
me jump like I would physically jump
awake and I don't think that's very good
for you I would prefer to be woken up
much more softly so I tweeted saying has
anyone tried any of the lights you know
the lights like the Lumia or whatever
they're called that just slowly but
surely make your room filled with
daylight and philips spotted that and
they have very very kindly sent me this
looks like it's got a few different
settings one to help you go to sleep one
to help you wake up a relax and breathe
setting natural sunshine and sunset
stimulation clinically proven 92 percent
of users find it easier to get out of
bed i love the sound of that and this is
definitely something that i'll be
updating you on again on my instagram
stories so thank you very much philips
I'm very very grateful and I'm so
excited to try this out next up is a
delivery from Neal's Yard remedies and
inside this lovely box we have got this
is a water bottle and it says fill me up
at your nearest store hashtag NY refill
and inside don't know how clearly you
can see that but there is a giant
crystal mindful drinking at its best
the press release is talking all about
the problem of plastics how much plastic
we throw away and don't recycle here in
the UK it says in the UK alone we use up
to 13 billion plastic bottles a year
only 3 billion of these are being
recycled that's 10 billion plastic
bottles a year that are just being
thrown into land mass into the oceans
and as you know Charlie and I are huge
fans of the Maldives and we love going
on peaceful holidays but it makes me so
upset when I see the amount of plastic
washed up on the beaches it's really
really heartbreaking so it's so lovely
to see a brand as big as Neal's Yard
doing something to raise awareness for
that it says they're continuing their
campaign to come
unnecessary plastic use Neal's Yard
remedies is proud to be the first high
street chain to roll out free water
refill stations nationally so if you're
out shopping and you've got a reusable
water bottle with you and you go pass
some Neal's Yard Store and they've got a
refill logo in a store window or you can
download the refill app then you can top
up your water for free and then they've
also shared some tips on how to reduce
your plastic waste which is really
important so I'm going to whiz through
these number one invest in a good
quality reusable water bottle it will
very quickly pay for itself I'm not sure
what the brand of this one is but it
does say a little bit of holistic
hydration maybe you can search it online
if I find it I'll leave a link down
below because I think this is absolutely
gorgeous
it says refuse plastic straws you can
purchase a reusable steel one or just go
without that's something as well that
Charlie and I have done in our house we
have bought just from Amazon some steel
straws and we use them every morning for
our juices and smoothies I'll leave them
linked down below because they're
amazing and also they don't go soft and
floppy like paper ones do so definitely
invest in reusable straws always carry a
reusable shopping bag with you a thin
folding bag takes a part in each space
it will save you getting caught out by
impulse shopping definitely do that
avoid disposable cutlery by carrying a
spork and a reusable coffee cup will
help save the planet and now save you
money and many coffee shops and
restaurants they offer you discounts
when you use one so those are Neal's
yards quick tips for reducing your
plastic waste next we have a very oh
that's Charlie's not gonna open that one
who's gonna say a very exciting looking
black bag next up is a bag from LK
Bennet and I'm going to an afternoon tea
with LK Bennet's
actually the day that you're watching
this and they have very kindly sent me
some pieces to wear to the event I think
actually this is a handbag
I'm totally spoiled but how nice today
oh my goodness oh my goodness ah my
first thought is this is definitely
something that Kate Middleton or Meghan
Markov would be seen carrying this is a
beautiful taupe colored handbag oh my
goodness that color is just a dream I
think you ah that's very satisfying
press the button to open it very very
spacious inside I wouldn't quite be able
to fit my laptop in but if I'm not
taking my laptop out for the day this is
power
it's soft leather on the front and back
one big strip of leather and then you've
got suede side panels which is a really
lovely extra detail you do have a zippy
pocket in this one and then also inside
is a shoulder strap and I love carrying
bags hands-free so having a shoulder
strap is amazing this is a very light
handbag I know when my mum is looking
for handbags it's so important to her
that they're not too heavy she doesn't
like any heavy chains or straps or too
much metal detail this would be
absolutely perfect for her I might see
what other color options they have
because otherwise she'll definitely end
up Steven this one from me but yeah if
you like lightweight but very very
beautiful handbags this is an amazing
one as I said everything will be linked
down below I have been absolutely spoilt
by l.k Bennet's there is even more this
one looks like it contains a pair of
boots I actually spotted I think it was
um one of my blogger friends Amy Neville
she was wearing a pair sure it was her a
pair of beautiful grey suede boots from
Alkaid Bennet two recent press trip we
went on together and ever since then I
have just lusted over their boots so
much these are not the same boots that
Amy had on because those went down into
sale but they are absolutely stunning
these are very very similar pinky nudee
taupe shade as a handbag it's the color
that I absolutely love and works so well
with my wardrobe so these will be
guaranteed to get a lot of use they're
beautiful buttery soft leather as well
the quality of these is absolutely
gorgeous really nice heel height as well
I feel like I could walk around all day
and still be comfortable with this heel
height next up is a blouse this is again
such a mean piece I just absolutely
adore things that are very simple very
classic but made of really lovely
materials and I'm so so grateful to
receive this it's so stunning really
lovely cuff details look how big and
almost masculine that cuff style is once
again you guys have you seen me wearing
this on my Instagram and on my blog very
very soon so keep a lookout that and two
more pieces from LK Bennet this is the
most gorgeous Lee soft jumper just a
very plain white or actually I'd say
this is a cream knit the only detail I'm
not sure if you can see but there's some
slight kind of different weaving effect
on the sleeves that are really beautiful
very very subtle detail again
kind of thing that is such a statement
such a classic piece in any ladies
wardrobe and this skirt oh my goodness
oh how gorgeous is this it's very kind
of gossip girl very Chanel style very
cher Horowitz everything that I love all
of the style in SPO and wine this one
was oh my gosh it's called the charlie
skirt I'm so cute so this was 150 pounds
so it's not super cheap like a Topshop
skirt or River Island skirt but you guys
know I'm all about the price per where
and when it comes to classic pieces like
this that you'll wear time and time
again I definitely always think it's
worth investing in higher quality pieces
so once again prepare to see a lot of me
wearing it this one
this next blogger Mel says it's from
Benefit Cosmetics and it is out of this
world so they sent me a little countdown
timer which had like five days 17 hours
and it was counting down something which
is dun-dun-dun the new bad gal bang
mascara I have seen this all over my
Instagram it's gonna be one of those
very hyped up products but I have read a
few reviews and apparently it is worth
the hype I'm pleased to announce so this
is the packaging silver and pink you
guys are probably seen it on your
Instagram already and the mascara itself
there it is
the bad girl bang at mascara the brush
is a plastic bristle brush which is the
type of Bristol that I really like I
find it's best for really separating out
the lashes and making them very fine and
fluttery I've already got mascara on
today but I'm gonna take this with me on
my overnight bag to charli's my my dad's
house and give this a try tomorrow I
will be doing a first impressions all on
my Instagram stories another Beauty
launch and this is from girl and it says
dear Josie please find enclosed some
samples from our beautiful meteorites
and leopard tear open to our collections
levatino
la Petite robe Noire is one of my
favorite makeup ranges ever all the
products are delicately scented like the
fragrance and I just love them they're
very soft they're not too like bold in
your face makeup and very very me this
is the lip color pink the first thing
I've oh this is the first product that
I've reached for and look at that color
oh my goodness this literally could not
be any more
oh my gosh doesn't look like it's too
thick for a what I think is a matte
lipcream either
this could very simply become my new
everyday lip product I'm very much
looking forward giving this a try let me
know if you guys liked my vlog style
testing new makeup launches video that
went live last week or if you'd like to
see more of a tutorial for new launches
like this as I mentioned it is usually
wearing scratch stories but if you'd
like to see me trying these out in a
more formal way then let me know here's
another of the lipsticks this again is a
really really beautiful shade it's more
of a deep brown more of like a Kylie
Jenner kind of shade I feel like this
collection is so me this is the brow duo
in the shade light so it's in this very
sleek black packaging if I twist it up
you've got the brow gel this is amazing
and then where's the other part
it's a brow duo so I'm guessing there's
something else
ah so then the other end is like a
highlighting stick so if you want to
highlight just under the brow bone which
is of course very very flattering you
have it both in there love that here we
have gulen LaRouche oh my gosh you guys
look at this it's a heart shaped
lipstick oh my goodness I think this
might be a special for Valentine's Day
it says kiss kiss love love imprinted on
the lipstick that is adorable in this
packaging it's so cute villain
meteorites heart shape face powder oh my
gosh go down this is too much this
packaging oh my gosh
look at that look at this oh my goodness
heart-shaped palette for strobing blush
and illuminating oh my goodness and that
compact is adorable what is this pretty
little item a color correcting highlight
meteorite CC glow I think this might be
a little bit like the wire cell tissue
class maybe like a highlight version you
don't have any her load on today I'm
just doing this in my camera screen so
apologies if it's not turning out very
good okay I may have put a little bit
too much on there but this is beautiful
it's like a pinky pearlescent color
correcting highlight though it's such a
good idea
oh my gosh I will try this out properly
and not in my camera screen soon finally
and
new eyeliner la Petite robe Noire roll
and ink eyeliner don't know how much of
this you guys can see but kind of like a
black spatula intriguing
once again I'll give us going that you
know my first impressions this next one
is a mystery box it says it's from
L'Oreal but to be honest that does not
make me any the wiser because all of the
L'Oreal brands are sent from the same
place so often you don't know it could
be it could be Kiehl's it could be
Lancome it could be the body shop it
could be anything
so let's have a look what's L'Oreal
goodies line side so having said all of
that this is from actual L'Oreal from
stylists of the haircare range this I
think it's all about careful colored
hair or if you want to in fact color
your hair we have this amazing bundle
and looks like it's all about style your
way we've got a little press release in
here stylist does some amazing imagery
for the daring the shy for the
fashionista the anti conformist the
fancy and the genuine style it your way
a brand new and innovative range that
enables any color woman to bring to life
at their favorite social media inspired
looks love that we have got the blow dry
cream heat protector and style extender
the sleek serum heat protection up to
230 degrees then we've got to the curl
tonic for shape bounce and shine I love
all the colors of these stylists a big
hairspray and also the beach wave mist
so basically our products are pretty
much every hairstyle you'd want to
create and they also popped in t-shirt
that says worth it love it picking it
back to the old school L'Oreal I can see
myself using the big hair spray and the
blow dry cream the most my hair
definitely could use some heat
protection and style extending so I will
definitely be giving all of these ago
but I'm most excited to try these two
out no surprises whoo this one is from
it is from Bourjois
a giant wheel let's see what lies inside
it's like a giant flat hat box oh my
goodness
oh wow Rouge Edition Rouge edition
velvets liquid lipstick is what it says
on the press release some of them have
come out of their place but oh my
goodness it is like a blackjack board or
what's it called roulette pinwheel it
says spin the wheel to choose your
favorite shade it's landed on this is
probably the one I would have chosen
choco pink look how beautiful that color
is this is the color that's my wheel
landed on I feel like I really want to
give this a go now so the shade I
absolutely adore and it says extreme up
to 24-hour wear high concentration of
pigments high-impact Mac matte color
feather-light texture feels ultra
comfortable to wear I have to say it
does I barely can feel anything on my
lips no drying no fading and no
touch-ups needed we will see I'm gonna
be out and about all day so I will let
you know how I get along with this one
as you can imagine I'm only human and I
definitely cannot get through this many
lipsticks and I do have them for all of
the missing gaps as well they just fell
out of their little place so as I did in
my new Beauty launches video I'm going
to be doing a big giveaway and I'll
insert a clip on the screen now of the
goodies that will be in that giveaway
and all you have to do the same as last
time it's just be a really active
follower of mine I do notice you guys if
you're always commenting always liking
if you are of course subscribed here on
YouTube following on Instagram even if
you leave comments on my blog or if you
like my Facebook group I do notice and
use the hashtag the fashion manga beauty
giveaway and one of you guys will win an
amazing bundle of new beauty notches
okay the hair is up so that I can
attempt to concentrate I just washed it
about half an hour before filming and I
noticed it was getting fluffy and fluffy
up so I've scraped your back this next
delivery is from the Marks &amp;amp; Spencer
Beauty PR team and it is some new
launches from the rosy for autograph
amazing skin
secret collection I can't bring myself
to throw away rose gold tissue paper so
this is going in my box for my packaging
supplies and then we have this amazing
box that says Rosie for autograph
let's have a look what lies within
inside we have a huge selection of
foundations rosie has brought our
foundations for her range and Marks &amp;amp;
Spencer I think I would probably be this
fairly warm shade here this is a shade
nude beige SPF 30 it says and then we
have a quote from Rosie it says for the
days when I need a little extra coverage
I wanted to create a product that
offered a natural-looking flawless
finish for all of us combined my amazing
new skin secret foundation with the
amazing skin secret concealer to create
a gorgeous glow with buildable coverage
and a super lightweight feel I can't get
them out because they're very well stuck
in there but we do also have the
concealers I don't know if this is the
full shade range hopefully knocks it
doesn't go down very dark these are
probably the ones that are closest to my
skin tone beautiful packaging I'm loving
this rose gold lid and then you've got
the rosy signature on the front there
once again I'm gonna take this away with
me tonight and give it a go I will keep
you updated as to how I get along with
it next up is a little bag from Dior
beautifully packaged as always with the
ribbons and the pleats of tissue paper
and then the most beautiful little Dior
box inside I'm gonna pull on the ribbon
and see what we have here oh la la oh my
gosh I've seen this in magazines and on
some of my favorite PT bloggers
instagrams it's their capture youth
range and I've been so excited to try it
I also read some really interesting
things about how do you are being a lot
more conscious with their packaging
reducing all the plastic that goes
around the products and I think they
said they're trying to make it like 90%
recycled I'm not sure the exact facts
but I remember being very impressed when
I read it this is the Matt Maximizer age
delay mattifying serum then we've got
their age delay illuminating serum maybe
they're all age delay serums and they
have all different benefits this is the
lifting serum we've got the age delay
plump filler plumping serum and then
finally a redness soothing age delay
anti redness soothing serum so all of
them of course are helping the skin to
fight signs of aging but then you can
choose a serum depending on your skin
need which is amazing I would say maybe
the illuminating one is one that I would
go for I do have quite a skin but I
still like to have a glow
I think this might be my favorites also
inside we've got capture youth creme age
delay advance creme antioxidant that's
amazing if you live anywhere polluted
then you definitely need an
antioxidative face cream this is a face
and eye cream to smooth tone and
retexturize okay this next one is from
neon and inside we have got face up to a
perfect night sleep
neon organics perfect night sleep face
oil this sounds really lovely 100%
natural fragrance
natural fragrances for the mind and body
to nourish with vitamin packed almond

to get into but this is a huge box from
Estee Lauder I still don't know what's
inside oh my gosh I think it might be
from Bobby Brown actually oh my goodness
we have this box inside the box and it
is from Bobby Brown it says all-day
smile here's something to smile about
new long-wear weightless SPF 15
foundation full coverage and natural
matte foundation that blends seamlessly
into the skin for breathable skin
perfecting coverage with the looks fresh
from sunrise to sunset and unknown oh my
goodness think there's actually a top
section as well oh my gosh look at this
so they have sent an example of all of
the different shades of which there are
very very many of them and a new Bobby
Brown foundation brush which is amazing
because I actually think I left mine in
a hotel
and I was so gutted so very happy to
have a new one looks like this is their
vitamin-enriched face face with shea
butter vitamin C and E perfect popping
on the skin before foundation and oh my
gosh I am one lucky lady this is
literally the best blogger male opening
I think I've ever done I feel so spoiled
skin long we're weightless foundation
this is what they look like the
packaging in this frosted bottle and
you've got the pump to get it out of the
bottle I can't actually wait to give
this a choice I'm gonna just buff a
little bit of this on to my skin now but
I'll probably do some Instagram stories
tomorrow morning of first impressions so
check out my beauty highlights because
I'll save them all there and you can see
how I get along when I do this all
properly just read a little bit more of
a press release and it says it has a
combination of we're extending
ingredients oil control actives and true
to skin pigments best of all it contains
skin loving ingredients infuse skin with
hydration so the formula stays smooth
quiz free and true to color all day and
there are 30 shades so this really does
sound amazing a fabulous foundation
launch so yeah I'll keep you updated as
to how I get along with it my darlings
were nearly there just a few packages
left we have yay I have got a new
fragrance from Liz Earle I went into the
Duke of York's square for a facial the
other day spritz myself with this which
is the essence number 15 oh my gosh I
forgot how much I love this perfume 90%
derived from natural ingredients
bergamot virginians cedar wood
sandalwood cinnamon tonka I think it's
the tonker that makes me love this it's
quite quite a masculine fragrance but
whenever I wear this I just get a lot of
compliments and I love it so much so
thank you very much to the cell for
topping me up with this one this next
delivery is from Chloe I think it must
be another fragrance look how gorgeous
this bag is I love the shade of this
ribbon as well I feel like Chloe is a
brand that I really resonate with that
whole vibe so girly
I just adore it so much inside the bag
we have nomads Chloe in this beautiful
blush pink box a little draw reveals tan
tan-tan oh my goodness
this kind of looks like the shape of the
Chloe bags how adorable is that I think
this is a whole new fragrance I've only
ever seen their classic and their
classic fragrance before so let's have a
little look what says it's beautiful
little envelope where would you call
home home is everywhere home is now here
in this light in every person I meet I
can let go lose myself in the moment in
the movement as long as I go forward I
am home a lovely little note from Chloe
we are delighted to share with you the
upcoming launch from Chloe fragrances
Chloe Nomad launching on 15th of
February a brand new pillow from the
brand fresh and feminine with floral
ship ray not sure I said that right with
an authentic twist created by perfumer
Quentin beech
here is a close-up of the beautiful
bottle you've got swayed around the cap
here it says Nomad on one side and then
Chloe on the other all with the
beautiful signature pink as well that's
how little mist I already have the azure
fragrance all over me but if I spritz
this here oh my gosh that is actually
really different to what I was expecting
the original Chloe is quite like a warm
musky scent
whereas this I would say is much more
fresh much more floral it's still very
super feminine but there's something
quite crisp about it as well I'm really
bad at being able to tell them notes of
a fragrance but again I'll leave it
linked down below so you can research it
and I'm sure on the website will list
the notes inside but for spring that is
absolutely gorgeous thank you very much
to Chloe for sending this over oh my
goodness I am a very lucky lady I have
even more goodies from Liz oh my
absolute favorites this is their hand
repair again something I tried out when
I went to their store I have been
finding that I need something to help
with my hands lately not only are they
really drive from being out in the cold
but I've been doing more weights in the
gym lately and it really cuts up my
hands so this felt amazing it's filled
with essential oils you've got natural
source vitamin E moisturizers hands
conditions nails and as you can imagine
it smells amazing this is the super skin
overnight mask which I
ran out of so they were very very
generous and said they would chop me up
and then we have got the Liz L deep
cleansing mask this is her clay mask
it's like hard clay so it really helps
to balance out the skin bounce out any
oil pulls out any imperfections in the
skin and one of my favorite all-time
face masks so thank you very much to Liz
over sending notes over and then we also
have the orange flower botanical hand
wash and this will go really nicely I
think the top has suddenly broken so I
have to do count this cleanses softens
and leaves hands beautifully scented
this has got patchouli in there which is
one of my favorite fragrance notes so a
lovely pampering treat for when I wash
my hands next we have the world's
biggest envelope for the world's tiniest
little product this is the hilar b5
serum from La Roche Posay
I actually already received this this is
gonna go in the giveaway pile but this
is clinically proven to replumb and
accelerates the skin repair hyaluronic
acid and the vitamin b5 in this are both
amazing it just helping the skin look
great fresh hydrating the skin again
fabulous for this time of year so it's a
really really lovely product reduces
lines and re plumps increases skin
volume and elasticity
stimulates skin repair so very very high
claims on this I'm excited that one of
you guys will get to try this out as
well so that is going in my giveaway
pile next up is some fragrance products
from Tory Burch in this amazing blue
packaging this is the Bell as your Eau
de Parfum and bath and shower gel I love
mixing my fragrance with something else
like a body lotion or bath and shower
gel it's just like the ultimate
pampering and fragrance experience Tory
Burch is a brand that I adore I love the
clothes I love the branding I know that
it's such a fabulous lifestyle brand so
it's amazing to get to try their new
launches this is what the bath and
shower gel it looks like let's have a
little hello No oh my goodness that
reminds me of California ocean so it
says it's inspired by travel see and the
color blue unsurprisingly as much as I
said it reminded me of California oceans
it's actually inspired by the Cote
d'Azur the French Riviera this is what
the perfume bottle looks like my camera
has been so bad
focusing this whole times I'm really
sorry but absolutely gorgeous bottle
let's have a sniff of this notes include
peony and bergamot which again the two
of my absolute favorites I've got that
I'm Way too strong but that is really
really fresh a little bit woody but like
a really fresh wood it's got cedar wood
and I think vetiver the bottle is as
beautiful ombre blue you've got the
classic Tory Burch glass work on the top
and then the gold embossed Tory Burch
logo so that's gonna look absolutely
beautiful on my dressing table
thank you very much Tory Burch and this
will look amazing in my shower this next
one is a gift from my favorite jewelry
brand Monica vinegar so let's see what
is inside we have as always the most
beautiful packaging for on that Monica
vinegar this little box is what you get
inside and then you have your jewelry in

see it without me putting it on this is
a cuff and it's from their new Fiji
collection which I absolutely adore my
earrings are from the Fiji collection as
well I'm just learning these to do a
ship's and I love them this is I'd say
more contemporary it's a very elegant
style but it's not too in-your-face it's
very easy to wear very classic so thank
you so much to them for sending this
over I just love it we have a little
delivery also from Tom Ford in this
beautiful box and not sure what's inside

wrapped up as always Tom Ford Oh de
Soleil Blanc a captivating citrus scent
evoking the crystalline reflection of
white Sun sensuous game of sky on water

like an almost pearlescent frosted
bottle of their Oh de Soleil Blanc
fragrance oh my goodness this scent just
always reminds me of like you know late
summer holidays and you're just making
the most of those final hours of
sunshine that is what this fragrance
reminds me of I just love it so much I
also have a body oil from there still a
