a fabulous weekend today I wanted to
share with you a bit of a blog a melon
boxing slash new beauty launches I
posted a boomerang on my Instagram
stories yesterday showing you a boot
full of deliveries because we've not
been home for the past week and a lot of
you wanted to see this video so that's
what I'm going to film for you this
morning a very relaxed Sunday morning
filming session so I'm gonna get
straight stuck in there's quite a few
bits and bobs that I want to share with
you first delivery came in this
ginormous black carrier bag and
practical Josie is opening this one
first so that I can use the bag as a
rubbish bag and it looks like it is from
this works so Charlie and I used the
this work sleep spray nearly every
single evening on our pillow and it
looks like they are promoting a new
beauty and health regime autumn a
challenge of proactively prioritizing
getting a good night's sleep that's a
really good idea I feel like especially
this time of year is so cute they've put
in a sequined cushion this is gonna make
the lights go crazy on the camera I
think it says something at certain
angles but I can't see it with the
sunlight going directly onto it and then
they've put in their classic super sleep
202 natural pillow sprays in one I
actually haven't tried that one so this
is deep sleep pillow spray and deep
sleep plus and not too sure the
differences are maybe one is slightly
more intense version I also love the
little trouble miniatures of these
because because Charlie and I spray them
on our pillow at home that the smell
just instantly relaxes me it reminds me
of home so if I'm traveling if I'm alone
and struggling to sleep then it's a
really good idea to spritz my pillow
with this and it really really helps so
put that in annoyingly it's not quite
crushed I think we use this pack to
carry stuff yeah it says to natural
pillow sprays in one choose your sleep
solution so I guess you can kind of
tailor your sleep spray depending on
what you want so that's a lovely gift
from this works thank you very very much
and then next up I've been dying to open
this one it's a pink box sorry the
sunlight is coming directly into the
window so Lighting's a little bit
cray-cray
let's oh oh my goodness so this is it
looks like a wardrobe it's from benefit
Dexter you're going to try and sit by
mummy Texas is coming to join us it says
the great Brown Anza blockbuster brow
set five full-size best-selling brow pro
tools my goodness this is crazy as a
whole benefit is always one that just
goes crazy on the blog amel that always
so generous and they do the coolest
things so this is the Browns of wardrobe
let's have a look what is inside the
marketing team must have so much fun
making these I would love to do that
kind of job if I wasn't a blogger it
must be so much fun hey presto instantly
transform your brows be your own brow
expert with magic tips and tricks
included this is amazing so this is
pretty much the full benefit brow
collection I am a huge fan of the goof
proof brow pencil my brows just really
need doing at the moment so please don't
judge me
and then the browsing is palette is
gorgeous gimme brow of course actually
Charlie has stolen my last two gimme
brows I think he really likes the fact
that it gives a little bit of color but
it's not too obvious that it's good for
even guys to just shape their brow so
I'm pleased to have a top of that
because mine has been stolen but that's
amazing thank you very much benefit I
would look forward to using those and
checking out the magic tips as well this
next one I'm intrigued by it's a big
chunky very hefty wooden box and it says
Josie's eye Beauty besties that's really
really cute and then there's a little
padlock on here which thankfully is not
attached because I do not know the
combination but these padlocks always so
handy and that's really tragic let's
have a look what is inside oh my
goodness and this is from earlier this
smells amazing in here and I think it's
a selection of their new eye lashes let
me pop this on my lap so I can have a
look so got a little pouch which is also
personalized this trend of bloggers
mental peace is being personalized it's
just so lovely anything in my name one
gets me very excited so we have brown
magician precision crayon and tinted
fixer gel do I think this is a new
launch I've not heard of that before
brow tame and define wax a lot of brow
teemed bloggers males this morning and
earlier brow amplifier you can volumize
the brows by that kind of back combing
the thing it's like that when out so we
go we've got one of Flers brow pencils
which I'm very pleased to have a top of
off because I
used up my other one this is the brow
define it's got two different shapes on
it really really love those big fan of
those and then there's a few more
goodies in there but we have got one two
three four five six seven boxes and I
think each box contains a set of lashes
so this is go naughties
if the Kim lashes olala oh my gosh a
very very bold lash design these are
just great forgiving real definition to
the eyes it says spectacular length and
fullness it's gorgeous it's like a
gorgeous gift for your eyes that's
really really cute and then we have
plucking another one at random go 60s
Audrey these ones are a little bit more
me a little bit more natural you've got
that kind of three-quarter lashes
designed to give a cute subtle lift your
lashes a little goes a long way so
that's really lovely selection of lashes
from earlier I look forward to having a
look through the rest of those I'm gonna
move on to the next one okay I've got a
little paper bag here and it is from
magnet own so magnet own have the what's
it called sonic cleansing brush but I
feel like this is something different
all wrapped up oh my goodness so this is
a Viper sonic makeup blending brush
stimulates and blends from flawless
natural look and healthier finish that's
really interesting so I'm guessing it's
going to be like a vibrating or
oscillating makeup brush to help you
blend a little more massages skin used
with any powder and liquid makeup smooth
blend had two speeds slides over skin to
apply makeup like a pro I like the sound
of this hopefully this will give a
really nice kind of airbrushed finish to
the skin will it beat my Beauty Blender

a trial and I'll probably let you know
on my Instagram stories that's why I do
most of my first impressions intrigued

absolutely beautiful it's a very floral
fragrance but quite on the shore one as

would give you my first impressions 69
pounds available from this month Liberty
spacing quenette afford to Urban Roots
at Harrods and selected Harvey Nichols
stores very very exciting lovely new
launch from hourglass
ok we have a rather huge box I already
cut it open but I'm yet to peek inside
so let's see what's in here I have
absolutely no clues as to what's inside
this one ok so in the box we have this
beautiful straw basket I absolutely love
these are so cute from holiday so very
very grateful for brands that send these
especially when they have these cute
little messages on them this one says me
time which we all need every now and
then for very orange tuned Freight or
tunnel so oh my goodness
I can see what's inside so it is this
new
shampoo conditioner and mask range from
L'Oreal and I actually heard about this
and could not wait to try it so I
already bought the entire range from
boots last week but I can tell you it is
amazing in fact I use this on my hair
yesterday and my hair still smells
amazing
this is from their extraordinary oil
range and if you ever tried the actual
oil you'll know how great it makes the
hair feel it's just so good for any
damaged hair any dry Heather needs
nourishing now they've expanded the
range to include a this is a multi-user
nourishing balm so I use as a deep
conditioner and put it on my have three
minutes last night with fine coconut oil
and then you've got the shampoo and
conditioner I also use this when I went
to a spin class a boom cycle and then I
had my hair blow-dried and the lady
could not stop saying how great my hair
smelled so already a huge fan of this
range and I will continue to use it in
fact I'm already like two-thirds through
this so very very thankful to have a top
up Thank You L'Oreal and then there's
also some other bits and bobs in here a
little treat for your feet Oh what is
this ahh bed socks oh my goodness bed
socks made with mohair how cute is that
I love these little things like these
the kind of treats that you wouldn't
necessarily splurge on for yourself so
the fact that brands send you these
lovely little gifts to go with the
products to really kind of emphasize the
product benefits I guess they want you
to just indulge in some me-time put on a
hair mask put on your cozy socks I'm
just so grateful for and so these are
cute little bed socks which I'll
probably wear on airplanes as well as
any long-haul flights and then we've
both I mask which says dreaming of Coco
Coco's my mum's dog's name so I'll be
dreaming of her and then we've got the
classic extraordinary oil which I just
love it's so light you can just put it
through the ends of your hair if you've
got any little flyaways any frizzy bits
which since I have my have leached I
have a lot of so you can just kind of
run it through the hair just gives it a
gorgeous smell gorgeous texture goodness
alert coconuts and coconut coconut cream
milk chocolate and more chocolate from a
hotel at shockula very coconut themed
this little package
and then last but not least evermore
London I feel like this might be a
candle judging by its heaviness Oh 100%
organic wax blend evermore light coconut
wax candle okay I can't open it cause I
have the extraordinary oil all over my
hands but I'm sure that smells
absolutely dreamy and then we've got a
little bit of press information here so
already a huge fan of this range and
very very grateful to L'Oreal so thank
you so much for topping me up this will
get used very very quickly I am sure
next is another package doesn't have any
information on it always a surprise oh
my goodness so this is from my favorite
fragrance this is fiction real flower
bomb I have been wearing this for so
many years so many my friends would say
that when they smell this it reminds
them of me it's kind of become my
signature fragrance so this is a top-up
I think and you and oh my gosh No okay
this is this must be a new launch this
is a scented candle a Viktor and Rolf
flower bomb scented candle I cannot
imagine anything more amazing smelling
than this I cannot wait in my bedroom
for my dressing room maybe a bit
feminine to have in the bedroom I can
smell it already
oh my goodness imagine your whole house
smelling as good as flower bomb smells
ah oh my god that is just perfection
this is me in a candle so gorgeous I'm
gonna have to put that down otherwise I
won't be able to stop smelling it that
is amazing let's see when that is out 40
pounds I thought that'd be more actually
so it's you can get the flower bomb
candle and the bon bon candle both 40
pounds available from this month from
Debenhams as very exciting really a
Christmas present for anyone that loves
flower bomb I think a lot of people will
be getting that for Christmas I
certainly would be thrilled to see that
under my tree don't know what this bit
of hair is doing that up okay we're just
gonna just gonna leave the hair going on
there we go okay so this is a cute
little bag and inside
Veta
it says we've got two little canisters
I've not heard of this brand before v2
Glo is its skin carrier is it a candle
flavored marine collagen we've got peach
and original so I mean college it is a
complex structural protein found in skin
hair and nails are they tablets let's
have a little look so it's like a tin oh
my goodness it's literally powder so I
guess you put this in your smoothies or
you could put this in some water in the
mornings maybe I should just stop
guessing and actually read the front
release so it says Australia's leading
health and well-being brand Vita glow
it's launched in the UK a hundred
percent natural supplements that promote
optimal wellness and vitality marine
collagen in your daily diet helps to
stimulate the body's natural supply of
collagen it comes an original blueberry
peach mango and pineapple and a part of
this is 32 pound 95 available from Vita
glow calm that sounds really really
interesting so it's nice to have some
kind of some product that's good for
your skin that you actually ingest
instead of putting it on the skin I
think that could have a lot better
benefits so that's okay so you can put
it in your tea coffee juice smoothies
shakes porridge yogurts etc etc take one
to three servings per day I'll try this
out let you guys know how I get along
with it because that's certainly a love
the fact that it's 90 percent natural
that sounds amazing so this package
already burst open and I had a little
peek inside and can't quite believe my
eyes it looks like it is full of why I
sell makeup and I don't often receive
things from wire cells this is very
exciting and I think it's their new
lipstick launches they are called the
tattoos Cuccia kachou mat stain and I
love matte lips as you guys know and
she'd say I've got more of a barmy one
on today I've got Estee Lauder
insatiable ivory which is one of my
all-time favorites oh wow
I was not expecting this I'm used to
wire style just being the full-on gold
packaging but this looks like it's
probably gonna be a doe foot applicator
oh my god that is dreamy and what a
perfect autumn shade oh my gosh
okay I have a burgundy coat that I'm
wearing later so I feel like I
definitely need to put that on there are
so many in here oh my god I'm so lucky
this is incredible beautiful bright red
that is gorgeous
I'm not going to search them all right
now because I will get it all over my
top and they also as well as loads of
those colors
perhaps they come with or they have
matching lip liners this looks like a
lip liner yes look at that so you've got
on one end ah sharpener in the lid
that's amazing and I think that's kind
of like a blending section and a rollup
lip liner I love it when they're roller
because who can be bothered with
sharpening certainly not me wow so many
to look at i will try these all out do
lots of swatching and probably put some
swatches on my blog so if you don't
follow my blog fashion manga calm that's
why I do most of my beauty refuse so
keep an eye on that I'll just open one
more color another bright Coralie red
that is so gorgeous I feel like they've
gone from really bold classic shades
look at that stunning stunning stunning
stunning and let me tell you price etc
so handy when everything comes to the
press release so these are twenty eight
pounds six new leather matte shades with
the iconic Rouge pur Couture the mattes
collection rose ink black red coral rose
ELISA - crazy tangerine gorgeous

oh my gosh so excited to try those so
they're so generous thank you very much
wire sell to more bloggers males to show
you um this one says return address ten
Cavendish place which I know is the
Clarins head office so I'm guessing
that's going to be me launched from them
I'm a huge fan of Clarence let's see
what this is for color pen interesting
so it says this is a retractable pen
which just always reminds me of revision
because I used to do different color
coding for my different revision notes
with one of those four clicky pens I
don't know how they
made this for makeup for all in one pen
for eyes and lips and you've got brown
black another kind of more nudie brown
and a navy oh that is so funny so I
guess you've got i'm guessing it's gonna
be one lip liner and four eyeliners
black and blue eyeliners a brown
multi-use liner and a flattering nude
lip liner all containing Clarins plus a
complex of sunflower Hoeber black acacia
waxes providing the eyelids and lips of
comfort all day that's amazing and then
it twists so that the product comes out
that is so genius great for in the
handbag oh my gosh that's so clever that
is so clever why has no one done this
before proper old school like throwback
to your school days I will have great
fun playing with this thank you very
much parents this 128 pounds which is
really good for for Clarins pencils and
and it's available this month October as

should give that a try something unusual
something different and last but not
least this is from a PR company oh this
looks like Liz Earle turquoise yes one
of my favorite skincare brands if not my
favorite such a huge lover of Liz Earle
all of their products are gorgeous let's
see what is in here share Britain's
biggest beauty secrets hashtag cleanse
and polish if you guys haven't tried
anything polish it absolute you have to
so many of my friends been converted
since I've recommended it to them if
you're having just like a bad skin week

days and sorts it right out so this is a
gorgeous little gift set I was do a
topper of this actually I just finished
my last one a couple of weeks ago
actually and I didn't repurchase I had
another one I wanted to try out but
nothing used to saying it was cleanse
and polish this is the absolute classic
I'm sure all of you recognize this and
most of you will have tried this such a
fabulous cleanser iconic legendary
status um and then they put in a I think
this as a hair band which is great
because mine all disgusting and orange
from all my makeup
one of those kind of velcro hair masks
keep hair out your face and the classic
cleansing cloth to remove it so this
just gently exfoliates the skin and also
remove
a product with warm water as well just
the perfect cleansing combination thank
you so much LaSalle for topping me up
very very generous and yeah I will love
this all my life if I stopped becoming a
beauty blogger this is what I would
repurchase a time and time and time
again and if you're looking for a
cleanser you want to just step up from
the usual micellar water this is the one
this is the one so that's everything
that was in at my P o box this week

take this for granted so so lucky to be
