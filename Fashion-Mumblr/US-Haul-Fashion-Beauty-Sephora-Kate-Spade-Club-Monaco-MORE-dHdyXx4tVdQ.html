channel as you can probably tell I am
filming at home at last I'm back from my
incredible trip to California so as you
probably know if you followed my
snapchat Instagram Twitter or YouTube
videos recently I've just got back from
the most incredible trip to California
with Trek America I will leave all of my
vlogs down below so you can see what I
got up too you can see me shopping in
action as well as doing the most
incredible things ranging from visiting
the Hollywood sign
taking sunset boats under the Golden
Gate Bridge in San Francisco checking in
Yosemite as you can probably tell I just
had the best best best nine days ever so
yeah obviously while I was out in
America I did do a bit of shopping and I
went shopping on Rodeo Drive in LA I
went to a few boutiques in Santa Barbara
and then also did some kind of city
center shopping in San Francisco so as
you probably some from my snapchats I
did buy quite a lot I was fairly
restricted by my luggage allowance but I
did manage to bring quite a few things
back home with me and shops and I went
to just looking at my bags I went to
Kate Spade Tory Burch Abercrombie Club
Monaco Sephora of course Victoria's
Secret's forever 21 and and Chanel so I
think that's about it store wise and
this could be quite a long video so I'm
just going to get started in no
particular order just depending on which
bag I grab first so I went to the Kate
Spade store in the Westfield Shopping
Center in San Francisco Kate Spade if
you don't know is American brand which
means that it is considerably cheaper
out there I didn't really have anything
in mind when I went into the store
normally I look at their stationery
because I absolutely love Kate Spade
Diaries but actually I think I already
have two if not three Diaries for this
um this kind of summer going into next
year but instead I was drawn into the
store by their summer holiday range I
think is cool like their vacation range
and it was fairly expensive so I just
wanted to buy into the range but without
going for a whole hog and getting a
handbag so what I picked up is this
absolutely gorgeous little purse
and I decided to get a purse because
when I go on holiday I like to kind of
enhance my cash my notes and my cards
into a smaller purse to save me from you
know just carrying my UK purse around
with me and I thought this one was
absolutely perfect it's a beautiful pale
blue color it says I need a vacation on
the back and it's got these gorgeous
very 3d palm trees on the front and I
thought it's just the perfect size for a
credit card and a few foreign notes in
there as well as maybe a few business
cards because I've always carried my
business cards around with me and this I
think was around $70 so I think that
makes it about like 45 pounds correct me
if I'm wrong but I think that's roughly
how much it was so yeah not cheap but I
just thought it was so cute really
adorable and as I said you know when you
just go into a shop and you just want to
buy into the range because it's so nice
but you don't necessarily want to splash
out two or three hundred dollars on a
handbag so I really really love this it
came in this gorgeous little pops this
little what-you-call-it packaging tub so
yeah it's really pleased with this
little purchase I did actually buy
another person while I was in America so
keep on watching to see which other
purse I picked up also in San Francisco
I visited the Victoria's Secret store on
Union Square and Union Square is kind of
the main shopping area if you guys do
have to find yourself in San Francisco
shopping around Union Square then I
definitely recommend you head to the
seventh floor of Macy's because there's
a cheesecake factory there and you
basically can sit outside and you have
amazing views over all of the main kind
of shopping district so yes I went to
Victoria's Secret and I don't know if I
should really show you what's in here
because obviously Victoria Secret is
underwear but I basically just got like
a little flash and I got a load of pairs
of knickers or panties as they call them
out there I really hate their own
panties I think it sounds really like
childish anyone else think it's such a
gross word and fit yeah Victoria Secret
underwear I find really good for just
being comfortable being fairly
see-through when I when I say that I
mean kind of you can't see it through
your jeans if that makes sense so yeah I
got I think that's five for $27 so I got
10 pairs of knickers and I also got this
bra I feel like I can show
your products not that bad um and I just
thought this was really really pretty I
absolutely love strapless bras I find
them really practical I normally just
buy white ones but I do have a few
darker tops that I could wear this with
it does have detachable straps but I'll
probably just wear it as a strapless it
has got quite a lot of padding in it
because them as I've mentioned in
previous videos I'm slightly lacking in
the whole area and the bra was fairly
expensive I think the bra was about $60
and for like 52 or something yeah
$62 and it says 55 pounds so I think the
exchange rate was better than that um so
yeah I got a few thousand acres and a
bra from Victoria's Secret I actually
went in there looking for swimwear more
than anything but I was fairly
disappointed with the range I think it
was coming to the end of their summer
drop so they maybe only had about ten
Styles all of which I thought were a
little bit young for my personal taste
but I'm really pleased with the
underwear that I got from Victoria's
Secret first makeup thing that I picked
up on the trip I was from Chanel and I
visited the Chanel store on raid rely on
Rodeo Drive with Maddie when we were in
LA and I have to say I probably did not
need this product at all but when you're
in the store does the whole in-store
experience was so incredible and I just
wanted to buy something and obviously as
much as I would love to I couldn't
afford the gorgeous blush pink boy bag
let me know if you spotted those on my
snapchat because they were just heavenly
so instead I picked up this which is the
Chanel Rouge double intensity ultra wear
lip color and I picked up a shade 69
which is tender beige and it's a very me
color really easy to wear I'll show you
a swatch close-up but I just thought
this is really beautiful everyday color
and I've used the red one of these
before and the gloss and the lipstick
itself is super super long-lasting I
wore the red all the time at Christmas
it's just my go-to festive shade because
it really does not budge and that's what
I kind of look for in everyday lipstick
so I thought I would pick up this a
little reminder of my trip to Chanel on
Rodeo Drive
I also absolutely love this little
carrier bag I can only imagine help you
through they package up a handbag when a
lipstick comes as gorgeously wrapped as
this it was in tissue paper but then the
bag has this little Chanel ribbon and a
gorgeous kind of fabric rose as well in
this cute little carrier bag which I'm
probably
I'm going to keep just it's so cute and
yes I did flat pack all my carrier bags
and bought them host the UK just for
those videos I hope you guys appreciate
the dedication there next up is another
store that I visited on a Rodeo Drive
and Tory Burch is another brand that I
absolutely adore but I only tend to buy
when I visit America because it's so
much cheaper over there when I was in
Texas last March I went a little bit
crazy and Tory Burch I've got a couple
pairs of sandals and a candle sandals
and candle but this time I was really
tempted to get another candle but I just
thought you know what it's really heavy
and I don't really have room so what I
did pick up was a new purse I told you
I'd buy another one and here it is
I bought this purse as my UK everyday
kind of handbag purse because the one
that I use at the moment if you've
watched any fine what's in my handbag
videos you'll know it's that pink as
sparkly Kate's papers which I've
probably had for two and a half or three
years it's getting a little bit battered
I still love it but I thought it was
time to upgrade this one is a little bit
smaller than my Kate Spade ones it's
probably like about this much smaller so
I really love the size it's good for my
new kind of slightly smaller handbags
it's one big zippy compartment and then
inside you've got this little slot here
which I think would be really good for
making my phone might potentially fit in
there and then you've also got a few
card departments here and I do tend to
carry a lot of cards so I think they'll
come in really useful the only annoying
thing is it doesn't have a coin slot but
to be honest I very rarely use coins
anyway and what just fell out was this
strap which I think makes it really
really useful because it has a little
clip here so I can just clip the strap
onto it and then third and and then
you've kind of got a wrist strap which i
think is really really useful
I could even use this as a little clutch
for nights out if iPhone does fit in
there and then I'll just make it really
really handy for just keeping it
securely around my wrist sometimes when
I dash out to the shops I just don't
even take my bag I just take my purse
and this just makes it extra secure so
this I believe was around $120 so maybe
just under 100 pounds which for a
designer purse I think is really really
good and I love Tori
because it's a brand that not everybody
has it's not to kind of obvious it's
still designer or maybe you'd IQ premium
high street doesn't have ridiculous
price tags but it's still really really
lovely quality lovely design details I
really like the logo and really like the
gold detailing but yeah you don't have
to pay through the roof for it which is
what I love because I absolutely hate
feeling like I'm being ripped off by
brands so yes pick this up while I was
on Rodeo Drive next I'm going to go
through what I bought in the Sephora I
went to two different sephora's one of
them was in Santa Barbara and the next
one was in San Francisco uh before yes
the person was in Santa Barbara and the
second one once the robot one was in San
Francisco and but I kind of combined
everything into one smaller very chubby
looking bag so let's just go through all
the bits and bobs that I picked up
there's a lot of lip products just
warning you right away so this one I did
pick up in San Francisco and this is the
fresh Umbreon clay purifying mask
um and I absolutely love clay masks I'm
always looking to try new ones I just
find them really really good for my skin
because they're quite balancing if you
have oily skin and I've not tried any
skin care from fresh before I've only
ever tried their lip balms and I just
love the sound of Umbreon clay and they
had an entire range of clay products I
think they even had a clay serum
cleanser but I just love my clay masks
so I picked this one up it's quite heavy
it's quite a big one and comes a little
spatula and then this light grey pot so
I'm going to try this tonight and I'm
pretty sure Charlie I want to try it
with me because we both love to do our
clay masks together so I'll be doing
first impressions on my snapchat so
definitely head over to my snapchat if
you're not already following and to just
generally see Beauty first impressions
next up in the goodie bag is Anastasia
brow Wiz I think you guys probably all
know about this product it's one of my
favorite brow products it's definitely
the finest brow pencil that I've ever
tried and with my brows how they're
quite sparse are quite gapi I really
like to fill in the individual brow
hairs so I got
always in the shade taupe which i've
used a couple of them before so i know
that i absolutely love this next up we
have the first lip product first of many
just warning you and this is the Tarte
lip in lingerie Maps tint in the shade
exposed and I actually hadn't seen these
products before and but I was really
intrigued by the whole crayon concept I
really love using crayons on my lips I
find them really really easy to use and
when I swatch this on my hand I just
thought it was such a beautiful color
and I thought it'd be really nice want
to just fling in my handbag and top up
when I'm on the go I'm hoping it's not
going to be too drying because sometimes
crayons can be a bit drying so I'm going
to have to keep my lips nice and
moisturized but I absolutely adore the
color of this think it's beautiful your
lips but better a really pretty pink
shade love the packaging as well it's
really nice and light and lippy lingerie
just sounds really lovely so yeah I
picked this up once again I'm doing
first impressions on my snapchat in a
few moments so sadly they might actually
be gone by the time this video goes up
but I'm probably using it in my snaps
anyway so keep an eye on that next we
have another lip product and this is the
Kat Von D everlasting liquid lipstick in
the shade
and Aero and I'd heard so so so much
about Kat Von D liquid lipsticks I never
bought one before not really sure why
something was always stopping me maybe I
couldn't find a knife shade but i
swatched this one in the store and I
thought it was a really beautiful shade
I'm afraid of all these shades are
really really similar I'm not terribly
daring when it comes to my lip colors
but this is a really beautiful brownie
pink and it really is like a tattoo for
your lips because once you apply it I
actually had to get two different makeup
removers to remove it from my hand so
hopefully I will be able to find a
decent makeup remover for my lips but I
just thought this is such a gorgeous
shade and I've just heard the most
incredible things about the Kat Von D
liquid lipsticks so not only did I get
that color but I also picked up um the
most infamous shade which is Lolita and
I got the Lolita one not Lolita two
because there's a new version of this
out now and again I thought this is
really beautiful wearable shade so to
Kat Von D lipsticks and really really
hope they live up to all the hype
because as I said they are pretty much
raved about by every single beauty
blogger
so picked up two of those then we have a
lip balm this is actually a Sephora own
brand lip balm and it's calls called the
rose Rouge balm makeup Road Rouge balm
sunscreen SPF 20 now I do have a few
more trips coming up and they're going
to be two super hot places so I thought
I could find it pretty useful if I got
an SPF for my lips and this is a really
beautiful soft pink color switched it on
the hand of course and it's really barmy
very very personal pink so it should
just give my lips a little bit of a tint
while I'm out sunbathing and also
protecting them with the SPF 20 again I
really really like the packaging of this
one I don't think this is too expensive
at all definitely under ten dollars I
think it might even have been eight
dollars so around like five pound fifty
six pounds that kind of price and I've
used the four lip products before I've
used their matte matte lip stains before
and really really liked them so I have
high hopes for this and it felt nice and
moisturizing on my hands so hopefully it
will be the same on my lips by the way I
should have said before but apologies
about my really nasal voice I seem to
have got like a stupid cold on the plane
coming back and that's why I sound a bit
like a man today for anyway next product
is the bite matte creme lip crayon you
may have heard me raving about one of
these in my 2015 beauty favorites so my
favorite beauty products of the whole of
2015 and if you didn't see that video I
will link it down below but I basically
raved about this in the shade amaretto
and it's probably my most worn lip
product ever I absolutely loved it as a
crayon so it's really easy to use you
just stick in your handbag and then when
you want you just roll it up and apply
it and for a matte lip product I find it
incredibly comfortable to wear I adored
the color of amaretto so as well as
buying another amaretto shade I also got
a different shade which is leche which
is a slightly more kind of nudey pink
again
but I've already picked up but you know
if you like a lip color then just why
why change it so this is a really
beautiful nudey pink with a slight
slight um yeah I once it's full-on nude
it's definitely more of a brownie
taupey nude but I just had to pick up
another color of this because I love my
amaretto so much and thought I would
grab another one to answer collection I
think I've gone through about four of
the amaretto ones now in my old job
whenever my manager used to go to the US
I used to give him a shopping list and
it always said times to fight matte lip
creme crayon a barrette oh so yeah I've
got another one to answer Ketchum now
what is next we have another product
from Tarte I think this one I picked up
thinking of something else annoyingly
and that hopefully I will enjoy using it
because I'm a matte person on the lips
but this one is one of their glossy lip
paint so it's called the Tarte iasts
closely lip paint in the shade goals I
like I like the way that they name their
product and by the color of this is
absolutely gorgeous and I really like
the packaging as well it's a really
sleek little container little product
here with a gold lid and gold writing
but as you can tell by the name it is
going to be glossy although maybe I need
to switch up my lip wardrobe and try a
few more glasses because I have probably
been wearing matte for at least a year
now so I'm quite looking forward to
trying it this out
and I'm having a slightly different
texture on my lips bones okay we're
getting to the last few products we have
one more from Anastasia I could have
sworn I actually bought two of these
maybe there's one still lurking in my
suitcase but this is the Anastasia
Beverly Hills liquid lipstick in the
shade plumberry us Beauty hauls and some
people absolutely love these rave about
them non-stop and buy the whole
collection and some vloggers just think
they're incredibly overrated personally
I just wanted to give it a try I love
Anastasia and really wanted to try out
their matte lipsticks so I picked up
this color thing he was just incredibly
wearable a really an really feminine
kind of elegant pink really easy to wear
day or night so I think it'd be a super
practical shade hopefully it's not going
to be too drying
um but yeah absolutely gorgeous gorgeous
color and I'm excited to make my own
opinion up about this I have got high
hopes and the stage
in my eyes just can't seem to do
anything wrong so yes hopefully this is
going to be a good one
and then last but not least from Sephora
I just picked up a few of the tarte high
performance naturals not so slick oil
absorbent blotting papers I actually got
these more to use while I was out there
although as you can see it's not been
opened yet but I find oil absorbing
papers really really handy to have in
your handbag I always Cadman my makeup
bag I tried loads different brands
before I think recently I've been using
Kleenex ones which are surprisingly good
and but yeah these were about six
dollars so not very expensive at all
considering it's tart and I really liked
the little box I thought this would look
much more acute in my hand like make a
piping Kleenex ones so yes I'm sure
these will be very very handy in the
summer months when I'm on holiday tried
to get rid of any shine and yeah they
look really cute so that's the last
thing that I picked up from Sephora if
you guys would like me to do any kind of
first impressions videos of the Norma
snapchat or tutorials and let me know
which products are really excited to
hear about because I will do more videos
about them I did of course try to find
the Anastasia glow kit which is the
highlight palette with the four
different shades on it but both suffer
as I went into it was sold out however
I've just received a whatsapp from Maddy
and who I went shopping with and she
said she managed to find one on her
second trip to the Sephora on Rodeo
Drive some incredibly jealous and yeah I
will leave a link to Maddy's us haul
video she's filmed it and published it
yet so you guys can see what she picked
up and how she gets on with the glow kit
but the hole is not done yet panic not
so you have three more shots to go
through next up is Abercrombie &amp;amp; Fitch
I didn't bring home the Abercrombie
carry bag so it's just too big but I
picked up a few things in Santa Barbara
starting with these flip-flops because I
realized that all of my flip-flops are
Havana's and as much as I love Havana's
they're just not very smart they're very
very casual so I decided to pick up
these a very classic and kind of brown
leather and gold thong bit
these were $38 so around 25 pounds ish
I'm not getting these exchange rates
completely wrong and but yeah I thought
these were just be really easy to slip
on on the beach and a little bit more
glamorous than my Havana's they also had
a sail on so I picked up these because
they were just really really cheap I
think I paid about ten dollars for these
which is like next to nothing and once
again these are just a really easy thing
to throw on on the beach really easy to
just crumble up and stick in your beach
bags I thought they would be something
that I'll get quite a lot of wear out of
in my upcoming beach holidays and
finally I picked up another slogan hat
not that I need another one because I
absolutely love the ones they have
already but this one says come sail away
which I thought was really really lovely
expression I paid $30 for this and then
Mady went back a few days later and got
it for $15 in the sails and gutted I
paid double but never mind
so yeah these slogan hats just seem to
be everywhere all over my Instagram and
everywhere else recently but I can't get
enough of them I think they're really
lovely and because my next two trips are
boat trips I'm going to create on
Saturday and in Greece after that both
of them are boat trips as I thought come
sail away it was quite appropriate for
those then I went into forever 21 with
Mady in San Francisco Mady got quite a
lot from there but I just picked up this
skirt I really really like scalloped
bottom skirts I wore them all the time
last spring and summer and I hadn't
bought any new ones this summer so I
thought I would treat myself and I
thought the red kind of candy stripes
are really really cute with a little
white t-shirt I think this will just be
a really really fun outfit so yeah pick
that up and it was $19 so what's up 14
pounds so really pleased I got that
quite a good bargain and then last but
not least I visited Club Monaco which
could have been really really dangerous
because I absolutely love that shop
everything in there I feel like it's
just so beautiful so elegant literally
my favorite kind of clothing in the
world and if I had loads of money I
would buy my entire wardrobe from Club
Monaco but as I don't I just picked up a
few key pieces first of all this t-shirt
and if you look closely at the fabric
you can see it's grey with little black
specks in it it really reminded me of
that fruit that's kind of bright pink on
the outside don't if it's like dragon
fruit or star mean it's dragon fruit
might have made that up but you
the fruit that I mean that has this kind
of white center and then the black pips
and it really reminds me of that but I
think it's just a really lovely classic
t-shirt this was fairly expensive for a
t-shirt the tag has come out but I think
is around $42 so definitely not cheap
but I've had Club Monaco t-shirts before
and I think they're not really lovely on
and I'm sure I'll get a lot of use out
of this one and last but absolutely not
least I picked up this beautiful little
dress from Club Monaco
I think this pattern is so beautiful for
summer it's white silk material with a
blue and it always looks hand-painted
floral design really love the waist on
this because you've got this freely
little band and then very beautiful
light fabrics it's going to be gorgeous
to wear maybe in the evenings when you
just want something over your shoulders
or on your arms and in one countries I
think it's going to be beautiful when I
go to Greece also um Croatia it's going
to look gorgeous while I'm on the boat
and in the little valleys in the
evenings so yeah this was I think it was
just under $200 so definitely not cheap
so I plan on wearing this a lot over the
summer I just saw the material the cuts
it just was absolutely beautiful though
I'm really excited to wear this in the
summer and then it's got an unjust dress
as well so it's going to be quite
covering not going to see through but
the only thing that I'm annoyed about is
that the top button here has come off to
be honest I probably wouldn't close that
top button but when you pay just under
$200 or something you don't want buttons
to falling off so a little bit
disappointed with that um some has just
gone behind a cloud so I know it's just
gone super super dark and but anyway
that is the final thing that I picked up
in America and that was from the club
Monaco in the Westfield Mall in San
Francisco so that's everything that I
picked up I'm now really excited to
start wearing these things start playing
with them and I'm just taking out bags
because they've been sitting in their
carrier bags for a couple of days since
I got back so I really hope you guys
have enjoyed looking through my shopping

shopping with you guys I love doing haul
videos and in fact I might be filming a
couple more in a few days time because
