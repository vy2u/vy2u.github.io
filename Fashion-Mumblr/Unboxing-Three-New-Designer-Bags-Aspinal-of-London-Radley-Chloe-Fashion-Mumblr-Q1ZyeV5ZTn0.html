channel thank you for joining me for
today's video it's going to be a handbag
unboxing video and not one not two but
three new handbags are what I'm going to
be unboxing for you today
these are ranging in price from around
140 pounds all the way up to just over
1200 pounds the most expensive of the
three is one that I've had on my wish
list for a long time and I thought out
open the wallet on camera for you to
share the joy of unboxing if you're new
to my channel then firstly welcome I
have so much amazing fashion content
coming through over the next couple of
months here on my channel you'll find
holes you'll find look books you'll find
styling videos most recently we've had
how to style over knee boots how to
start a jumper dress so if that sounds
like your cup of tea then please do hit
the subscribe button it's down
underneath this video and that means you
won't miss any of my future videos and
I'd love to have you along for more so
that further ado I'm gonna get started
with the first handbag the first bag is
from aspinall I have been really loving
Aspinall over the past like six months
or so I've just really become such a
huge fan of the brand you may have seen
me wearing the trunk bag so much almost
spamming you guys on my instagram and
here on my youtube channel it's just
it's quite a statement piece and I
really was surprised at how much I
absolutely adored it so still totally
smitten with that bag because of that
and another one which I've also been
wearing a lot over summer I've been
keeping a very close eye on the Aspinall
website when I saw this I just thought
that is my spirit bag that bag sums me
up so much and it's just everything I
love in a handbag so let me show you
what I picked up but first the
presentation of Aspinall bags I think is
beautiful they always come in as
gorgeous box so great for storage I
never chucked these things out and I
think for gifting it just is so so
beautiful also I love that it's a
British brand astronaut London another
big fat tick for me so inside it's not
actually in a dust bag I can see the bag
straight away this is my first time
seeing the bag and it is just stunning
so this color this blush nude pink I
feel like is my signature color I think
it's beautiful it's very neutral it goes
so many things in my wardrobe so that's
why I decided to go for this color if I
take it out the box we can see it a
little bit more clearly so this is the
small Dockery bag this was a
collaboration between a spinel and a
British actress named Michelle Dockery
the shape of it is kind of like a
doctor's bag it opens up I don't know
100% how to open it I guess you just
kind of pull it is that right yeah so
Wow actually that is very impressive so
you open it up it's not gonna snap back
which I'm very pleased about you can
definitely like dig inside and it's not
going to be hard to find anything it
opens right up this bag does come in a
larger size too but I'm trying really
hard not to fill my bags with loads of
crap so I thought that this would be a
really practical size it should I
believe also have a shoulder strap
here's the dust bag inside and then we
have the shoulder strap in the same
beautiful nude leather I think it looks
really lovely worn crossbody so I'll
definitely be attaching this the metal
is a very light yellow gold I don't
think it's quite rose gold and but
because it's slightly reflecting off the
pink it does look a little bit rose gold
II also inside we have got an envelope
pocket not sure if you can see that
there but that's just a nice little
pocket for perhaps your mobile phone you
can see on this side there's also a
zippy pocket it looks like if you shut
the bag and you can almost carry it both
ways so if you pick your bag up you
don't need to worry about which
direction it's facing on your arm
because it looks the same both front and
back this is made with very smooth
Italian calf leather but it's not too
spongy so hopefully it won't get
scratches on it it feels like quite a
substantial calf leather very high
quality as you expected Aspen all the
craftsmanship on this is absolutely
beautiful all the details are just
perfectly finished I can't stop staring
at this gold but I think the gold it's
like a brushed smooth gold and this new
leather looks so so beautiful together
I'm totally smitten with this bag in
case you can't tell I'm so excited to
start wearing this price-wise it was
eight nine five so it is a very
luxurious premium handbag but I do feel
that it looks like an even more
expensive designer handbag it has got
slight Fendi vibes
about it and they are double that price
so I think it's a very very good price
point for a bag of this quality as I
mentioned the Dockery bag this exact one
comes in a larger size I think they're
also bringing out a crocodile effect one
which will be beautiful croc leather is
very very hard-wearing
so if you are tempted by this kind of
badness your everyday bag that could be
a really nice option but yeah I'll leave
the Dockery page and this exact bag link
down below so you can check them all out
if you are tempted I am absolutely in
love I mean if you want the next bag but
I could start that one all day long this
next one is more affordable of the three
it comes in at 139 pounds and it's from
Radley I think Radley have got such a
fantastic position in the handbag market
everybody knows them for just incredible
beautifully crafted designs and yet the
price points are not ridiculous at all
once again right Lee London roughing it
for the British friends and this is the
bag that I have gone for actually this
tag on the back says $1.99 so perhaps
the 139th I researched early is a
slightly smaller size but this exact bag
will be linked down below this bag is
called the lavender Gardens large flap
over bag and it's made of a leather
that's quite textured so not quite
Saffiano leather which is that really
quite Scratchy one but it is a lot more
textured than the Aspinall bag so it is
going to be more hard wearing scratch
resistant etc etc but having said that
is white I do not own a white handbag so
that was one of my mainly since picking
this up to add to my collection
I thought the boxy style was quite
contemporary different to anything that
I own at the moment and it should be a
very very practical bag for the upcoming
autumn winter season once again this one
has got brushed gold hardware and inside
a beautiful pink lining the color
combination is so lovely with the creamy
whites and then the pink and then inside
a very practical selection of pockets
you've got a very big zip pocket for all
your valuables right in the middle there
a few side pockets your phone your
Oyster card and then a hidden zip pocket
to also inside you have this strap and
this was another one of the things that
really drew me to this bag it has got a
beautiful almost hand-drawn floral print
on it or kind of a leaf print on it
which I think makes a really lovely
design statement I think you have to
clip it
these bits here by the looks of it okay
I can't quite get all the plastic off
but I'm doing my best to attach the
strap I think they call it a guitar
strap when it's this thick but for me it
just there we go for me it just makes a
bag really really versatile to wear it
crossbody is incredibly comfortable
making this a really great everyday come
bag I think this is a really lovely
modern design I think it's very simple
very sleek I love the very subtle Radley
branding and just looking in the
viewfinder on my laptop it's very
photogenic so I'm very much looking
forward to taking lots of outfit snaps
with this one this could definitely
become a my everyday handbag I'm very
grateful for this textured leather so I
think is going to be a very practical
and well used handbag okay the third bag
last but absolutely not least is the one
that has been on my wishes for quite a
long time it is from Chloe I actually
had a far-fetched voter that I put
towards is didn't cover the whole bag
but I put it towards his handbag so it
was kind of one of those it's meant to
be moments you may have seen on my
Instagram or in my how to style a jumper
dress video that I did by the Chloe
Niall bag in Burgundy about four months
ago but I ended up returning it because
I didn't get that real heart fluttering
moment that you do want to have when
you're spending over a thousand pounds
on a handbag but then I kept thinking
about it I kept thinking about the Niall
bag I kept like seeing people wearing it
and thinking how lovely it was and then
I saw this colorway and my decision was
instantly made I fell in love and now it
is mine so this is the Chloe dial
bracelet bag in rose gold I'm not sure
how well the camera is picking it up but
it's like a crackle leather it is the
Italian leather that all the Chloe nails
are made from but it's got this gorgeous
metallic crackle print which I've not
seen before I think it's very unusual
I've not seen it anywhere other than on
the far fetch website maybe it's an
exclusive price point wise it was one
two five zero I believe which is about
100 pound more than the standard Chloe
now bag in the classic colors that were
used to seeing everywhere but I
definitely thought it was worth that
little increase in price I do actually
have a bag and a very similar color to
this and it is my Valentino rocks turd
glam lock bag and I wear that bag
so so so much it's getting very battered
it's kind of falling apart of the scenes
but I use it I've probably used it well
over a hundred times and that was
another thing that really sealed the
deal for me with this woman because I
thought color wise it's very similar
hopefully I'll be able to wear it with
similar outfits mix and match with the
Valentino bag and I know because I get
so much use out of the Valentino that I
will get a lot of use from this one
which is what you want you've got to
consider that price for wear when you
are buying a designer handbag I love
wearing the Chloe it now bracelet bag
over the arm like this you've got the
ring obviously that turns it into a
bracelet so then inside you do also have
the shoulder strap it's quite a thin
shoulder strap but because the bag
inside isn't huge you're never gonna
fill it and make it too heavy so it's
fine for the strap to be quite thin on
the sides here it is like a suede effect
and then you've got or in suede and then
you've got a band of news leather which
is the same as a strap running
underneath to give it that real saddle
design inside I have got my information
the I think this is a material
information authenticity card and then
just a little envelope pocket inside
nothing zippy just a small envelope with
a burgundy one I could fit in my
vlogging camera my little card wallet my
phone and just a couple of other bits
and bobs it is actually more roomy and
practical than it looks but speaking of
how it looks I think the Chloe nyle
bracelet bag is so beautiful visually in
photos in real life it's just such a
spectacular handbag I think it has made
its way up to classic handbag status
which is when I know that I want to
invest in something as much as I love
admiring bags when they're brand new and
everyone's kind of getting really
excited about them I do prefer to wait
until I know whether they're going to be
a classical not before I do invest so
far that strategy has done me proud
there are no handbags in my collection
that I regret buying none that I feel
are out of style now I wouldn't want to
wear and hopefully the same will be true
of this one I think I'll get so much use
out of this and the festive season that
I'll be wearing it in the evenings as a
crossbody over my coats to make a
beautiful statement and yeah absolutely
in love with this and just can't wait to
start styling it up with so many
different outfits so those are my three
new handbags I really hope you enjoyed
the unboxing of these I certainly did
I'm
excited to start wearing them as I
