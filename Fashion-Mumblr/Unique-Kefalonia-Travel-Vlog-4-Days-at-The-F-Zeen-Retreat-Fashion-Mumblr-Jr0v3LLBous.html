in my Lanzarote blog that I would never
start a vlog in a case before but I was
wrong because we are now at Mela Sahni
is that right Mela sorry and which is an
absolutely beautiful it's kind of like
an underwater que but we are fully under
the ground there it's honestly it's so
beautiful I will insert some clips here
so you can see our little tour we just
all into the cave into that black hole
over there which is like deep
underground into the cave this has
fallen about 5,000 years ago and it's
about 40 meters deep but the water is so
crystal here you can see right to the
bottom so this is the first thing that
we've done in Catalonia we're taking a
little tour bus around the island seeing
some a beautiful sight and I'm pretty
blown away together
before we demolished the table but
quickly to show you how much food we've
got on our table and honestly I was
saying Greek food is so underrated
everything we've done so
good morning it is day two in Catalonia
and we have woken up to beautiful clear
blue skies and sunshine just kidding
we've woken up to this yes there is a
man using a bucket to clear water from
my balcony because basically there was a
torrential thunderstorm and rain storm
last night and I woke up to a puddle of
water streaming into my bedroom hey guys
so it's actually been about 24 hours
since I last picked up my vlogging
camera um I think that's just kind of
because I wasn't feeling too well
yesterday feeling a lot bit stressed and
I've still got a silly fluey bug so yeah
I didn't really do too much vlogging and
the weather wasn't great yesterday it's
quite cloudy and then this morning it
was torrential rain we actually had a
bit of a flooding situation in our room
and the hotel guys are really amazing
about it they came with like buckets and
we're stopping the water from flowing
into my bedroom it's not really to vlog
about just breath walking up these
stairs but then this morning everything
kind of turned around had a really
beautiful massage here at the hotel
they're actually really revamping that
lens cap issues they're actually really
revamping their whole spa experience
it's going to be more more based around
wellness and all this kind of chakra
stuff which I'm getting really into and
yeah it's kind of taken that sort of
turn this whole trip so because it has
been a little bit cloudy um just walked
into the shade hopefully you might be
able to see me there we go
and yeah because it's been cloudy we've
kind of taken a bit of a different vibe
to the start of this trip so we've got
this lady who's come into the hotel
today everyone else has already done it
but I'm next after lunch and I can't
remember the name of this machine I'll
write it down here it's like bio
something it's all around like
homeopathy I hope I said that right
about the checkers about like the energy
of the body and I'm really starting to
like love this whole thing about
mindfulness and energy I'm really
excited to see this lady she has this
machine which apparently detects like
the energy in your body and can tell
where you have problems
so if you have a problem with your heart
like I know that I do I know I hold a
lot of stress and like my upper body the
girls have had it before Katie has quite
bad back problems and the lady could
tell that from her feet and was applying
pressure points to her feet which case
it was really painful
and whereas Carly had it done and she
didn't feel any pain during really solid
G because she doesn't really have much
stress and she doesn't really worry that
much so I know that it's probably gonna
hurt me quite a lot because I hold a lot
of stress um so yeah this trip has
turned into that kind of thing which I'm
really really loving and I really want
to get into more of it and I was
speaking to the owner's son who's kind
of been our guide a fan and it made me
realize that this is the third time that
like Chinese healing and like the energy
of the body has become apparent in my
life so the first time when I went it
leads laughs a second time when I met
this lady in London and I'm going to
tell you guys all about that in a blog
post and video soon and now here and I
feel like it's the universe telling me I
need to pay attention and I need to heal
myself and stop stressing myself out so
much like why did I choose to do
everyday May when I know I'm going to be
traveling and I know I'm not going to
have Wi-Fi that's been stressing me out
like crazy so I think I'm just going to
stop doing everyday maybe cuz why do i
why do I stress myself out like it's not
worth it I mean I love doing videos for
you guys obviously but it's actually
like ruining me I'm getting so ill
stressing myself out so much and I think
I just need to everybody just needs to
invest in themselves a little bit more
just prioritize your own wellness I
sound like crazy in such a preacher but
honestly I really want to take more time
for myself like do a bit of yoga
breathing and really read up about
mindfulness and like the body's energy
so yeah I'm probably going to ramble a
lot more about that after my treatment
so I'm going to go see the lady in a bit
just gonna have some lunch the Sun is
coming out so things are going to get a
lot more wonderful I'm sure but it
hasn't been wonderful it's been amazing
like starting our journey on the whole
mindfulness scene yeah gonna go and have
some lunch now and and I'll catch up
with you guys in a little bit so I've
ordered an herb falafel for lunch
which is
the owners daughters recipe so it's made
is it without flour yeah and like in
light oil so it's not an unhealthy
falafel with whatever is called that CQ
possibly and I've got one of their they
have amazing tees here and I keep having
this garden of eden' one which is just
really tasty with some honey and the Sun
is finally coming out okay so I've had a
lovely lunch and now I'm heading down to
see the lady for the reflexology I'm
actually really nervous because the
girls have gone before me the whole
trend seems to be the more stressed you
are the more it hurts so it's basically
going to kill me probably because as I
was just saying I am the straightest
person in the whole world and so yeah
wish me luck and let's do this
well the good news is she said I deal
with stress very well and she said that
I don't have any long-term stress
problems and that all my stresses at the
moment are oh I got to do this I want to
do that being too busy and there's no
deep rooted problems which I'm very
relieved that I did kind of want her to
be like oh you have this problem like I
can tell because this but she was very
like no you're okay you don't have too
much of a problem you deal with it very
well you cover up your stress very well
um which I guess is a really good sign I
don't know why I wanted her to be like
oh you're very stressed but yeah that
was good she did about 45 minutes of
reflexology massage on my feet and it
wasn't like painful like the other girls
said that there's were it wasn't like a
moustache like super relaxing it's just
a nice quite strong kneading feeling
which I really enjoyed actually and yeah
I feel a lot less jittery now a lot less
like I have to be doing something
although my to-do list it's still pretty
strong so I'm really glad I did that um
and yeah I think I'm going to go up and
chat with the girls now discuss our
experiences and then we're going to get
ready
okay this is how crazy or whether it is
currently hitting it that with brain we
can literally see the blue skies and
sunshine coming towards the rain and
he'll stop any second
you
good morning it is day three in
Catalonia keeping my voice down because
we're about to start a yoga session and
I think it's probably the most beautiful
place I've ever done yoga have an excuse
definitely beats the shark that's for
sure
so yogurt was really really lovely one
of the girls here who's actually the
daughter of the owner recently did a
course in India so she's now a fully
trained yoga instructor teacher so we
just did it as you saw on a beautiful
decking overlooking the sea and it was
really really nice way to start the day
and in there are all of us girls I just
don't buy the pool the sun is shining
it's only about 11:00 and it's already
scorching hot much more like it after
all the rain over the past couple of
days and as you can see behind me there
is a little bit of a photo shoot going
on bloggers seeing bloggers and I'm in a
shoe this little jumpsuit beach dress in
a second and it is from River Island I
think my bikini is also from our island
and I'm not sure so yeah going to shoot
that I think Katie as soon as she's
finished photographing Carly and then
writing out of the day I'm just
so we're just having a little tour of
some of the newer hotel rooms and on
this balcony is actually a really good
shot to kind of show you the whole
grounds of this beautiful hotel it was
staying in so yeah if you look behind me
you can see a few of the buildings down
there actually our room is a mouth lock
down there by the beach and you can see
exactly how close the beaches is
literally like across a very small road
so not like across a busy road or
anything so positioning wise absolute
perfect you've got one in the pools
there and then there's another pool over
here behind the restaurant so really
lovely small grounds to kind of feel
like you get to know everybody really
really lovely
so he just had a really really lovely
lunch at a place called cover we just
ordered a selection of starters and it
was really really yummy I'm becoming
seriously obsessed with all the food
here and now we're going for a little
Drive we're going to find a beautiful
scenic beach and we've just stopped off
by this viewpoint and this behind me is
argostoli which is a capsule it's really
beautiful and colorful don't you think
and yes what we are driving towards you
come to a beautiful view points
or just little Lagoon of turquoise which
down there but hopefully I think we're
heading out oh my gosh I think this is
probably one of the most beautiful
beaches I think I've ever been on site
inaudible cough and then maybe like 40
or 50 people here like it's pretty much
white sands beautiful these guys think
I'm probably just going to stop right
here and not do any more promoting and
Catalonia in the code do anything you
busy sup guys
so it's a few hours later since I last
spoke to you guys we've now come to a
beautiful beach for posture posture and
I think we're about 45 minutes away from
our hotel so on the other side on the
island the girls are all in their little
beach Cabana and it's such again such a
beautiful beach look at this so stunning
I think we're going to stay here until
sunset so maybe we've got another 45
minutes to an hour and Kati no I think
I'm just going to take a few quick
outfit videos
are done and the lighting was absolutely
gorgeous Sun setting behind us
yes there's Katie behind me wearing a
wedding dress where she the katie is
wearing a wedding dress doing a
beautiful blog post on high street
wedding dresses so it is published by
the time I put this up a link to it
I'm not sure if you can hear me because
a way to super loud but sunset oh my god
I think it's a song this job over there
but yeah so we obviously doing the
sunset and without set out for dinner
now temperature has dropped a little bit
so I'm using a towel
now come to a local vineyard whose
Gentilly and it's not drying off with
asshole this whole area you can see
behind me is pretty much the entire
vineyard and his tiny little cottage
which were about to go in now where they
produce the wine and yet this farm is
able to produce ninety thousand bottles
a year an export to America to the UK
pretty much everywhere and of course to
a lot of places here in Catalonia so
we're going to go inside now and give
them a try
you
hello again so we spent the afternoon
relaxing by the pool which is really
really lovely and now we've come to our
dolly which is a capital and we're
serving a little walk around which went
to an internet cafe and so that I can
load my video which is now two days late
nightmares and yeah I think we're going
to find somewhere nice to go for some
food I'd like to film another outfit
video and yeah I'm going to be doing a
lookbook because we're wearing so many
nice different outfits for this trip and
the lovely katie is connie filmed them
for me so we're going to find somewhere
pretty to do that that's a potential
little bit of marble stairs um so yeah
it's really beautiful capital city it's
a public holiday at the moment so most
of the shops are actually shut but this
is quite choiceless street so we seem to
have come into some luck
you
oh my favorite
you
we've just come to the place called La
Scala which is in the capital which is
named leaves town I love sonic I go
slowly and this is the traditional Greek
fast food and by fast food they
literally mean six on paper on the table
and shovel a load of food on it and have
a look at this it's all mayonnaise is
Kelly
oh ah the killer foods like what real
grace drink that's what the fair mating
is a little bit and there's lethal
so we are getting something now back to
rainy rainy
all the traffic that's where became a
although definitely a thanks to the
dodgy Wi-Fi I need you a couple more
days logs when I get home
so yes I shall see you very soon thanks
