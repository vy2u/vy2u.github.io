this is going to be a bit of a Spring
City Break vlog mum Charley and I have
come to Vienna the capital of Austria
for the week happened were actually here
for an Andrea Bocelli concert which was
mum's Christmas present very excited
about tomorrow night the plan this
afternoon is to just go and have a bit
of an explore the city get our bearings
we've just checked into our hotel which
is Motel one very very sensual we've got
the opera house like two minutes down
the road the room is lovely and bright
superfast internet which is great for a
city stay I'm not lurking our YouTube
videos we speak and as you come into the
room Charlie's dad would love this as
soon as you come in at the TV starts
playing this lovely crackling fire so
it's very very cosy so I'm gonna be
showing you what we're doing and most
importantly but I will be wearing for
this lovely spring weekend city break so
let's go
change I will give up
even Seok
listen to the morning
yeah
this is Justin Lee
they say it's all about
this is odd dinner venue this evening
that Charlie has researched restaurant
within the Park Hyatt Hotel hungry
it is day two or first full day
exploring Vienna it's a beautiful day
today blue skies and Charley mum and I
are starting by finding a really nice
breakfast place Charley I think this
Google and found somewhere lovely
it's called Joseph's brats so fingers
crossed it's nice we just found this
beautiful building behind me it's yet
it's actually the opera building so
China I've been taking a few shots for
Instagram so I'll be I'll show you my
outfit of the day so are you happy now
things just got so crazy from you simple
maybe it was a long way down I just feel
so happy without you
enough to almost bake me behind still
the night
on flashing up like the
Charlie is mentally planning his
Instagram grid as we explore the
architectural delights of Vienna what do
you think of this one darling is it up
to the Charlie Heinz Instagram grid yeah
what do you think the loads are suitable
for me Hill views Instagram may help you
know lady larger surround yeah it is
absolutely beautiful whoo look at this
so many incredible buildings in Vienna
and this is just the first one that we
found this is what the LA has to put up
with her when she comes
traveling with Charlie and I burn eula
laughing you used to this behavior by
now to get the shot
for a copy in this beautiful spot the
sun is shining
Lilla is taking her brand new handbag
out for the day
how are you getting on with it the lack
of it's a little review nice color it's
like a blush pink
you've got the do you wear a crossbody
yeah you can besides taking my hand oh
it's sick of the size and make
it make it more yeah yeah which you
think probably could we just take the
decorations out Wow
and you keep your phone and your oyster
and known what wasted card and then
inside you have got a clip across just a
bit more security
then another huge
pockets with your iPad Navy's available
today at what price
so no I'll be putting the loves rewards
I'll link down below if you buy now it's
your favorite shop behind you shop
Nespresso
so this spectacular church was built in
year 740 how crazy is that and now in
the modern world we have a Zara directly
opposite
that we are being ultimate tourists this
afternoon we've been on the Vienna
hop-on hop-off bus and now we are at a
beautiful place called Sean Runa palace
which is this spectacular building
behind me
Sean Bruna means pretty extreme because
when they built it they found that it
was on a beautiful stream and they said
that the world's oldest zoo apparently
is here and in the 16th century
someone from Egypt brought over a
giraffe and then the whole of Austrian
culture became obsessed with giraffes
that's what you learned on the hop-on
hop-off
she's gotta shut down
Oh
I'm holding on therefore must come
someday I'm not finally making through
the game just have to wait you whisper
to me there's no
there's only time for dreams
a very chilly start to our second
morning in Austria we left the hotel
about half eight this morning so we've
beaten all the crowds we are making our
way to brunch but our route there is
very scenic we are currently in the
museum's quarter and we're pretty much
the only people here very cold but
beautiful the buildings here shout like
that every single building is I would
say bigger than Buckingham Palace it's
very very readable look at this
look at this
it's currently 2 degrees outside and yet
our Charlie Owens has taken his
breakfast outside so that he can get
into scram photo
that is dedication nailed it oh nice
a delicious brunch at Cafe Eric Eric
Chinese breakfast was the biggest
breakfast I've ever seen and now we've
come to the Joseph Platts and we are
watching the Spanish horses which Lala
I'm very excited I'm very excited to
come down
he's rearranging the table again yep
even the laws been taking pictures so
those doing it flatly
I've got a cute little Easter chick cake
yummy
so we just had a rather overpriced to
not say and cake in the cafe Central and
justice I just gave a bit of wonder and
we found ourselves we found ourselves in
the middle of the east market all around
me there's these beautiful hand-painted
eggs I think it's tradition that you
just fill up a little egg carton and
hang them from trees I have never seen
so many eggs in my life
look how gorgeous they are all
hand-painted they even have dog ones
King Charles Cavaliers sausage dogs
spaniels so cute
so it's up final afternoon and just set
up base camp in the hotel because it's
very very cold outside I'm a little bit
knackered so I'm just checking in online
and Charlie and I are both starting to
write up on Vienna blog posts I thought
I would quickly show you how APNIC these
photos look with the fashion under
presets on and let me show you how easy
it is as well to bulk edit all of our
travel photos so here's a current desk
situation I've got my latte
Humber's which who knew they're
gluten-free and then I've imported all
of our holiday photos into Lightroom and
then what I'm going to do with this one
is so here on the side this is where all
my presets are and as you scroll over
them you get a little preview
I think the cappuccino ones would look
quite nice not latte cappuccino ones so
I'm going to click cappuccino bright and
then you can see it just instantly
changes the photo so look how much
better that looks than oops that like
that's just a normal photo and then as
soon as you add the filter super
Instagram and then you can see here I've
pasted that exact setting over all of
the photos I haven't had to gone through
and edit them all individually even
things like landscape photos like this I
mean it just warms up all the colors
this is how it looks originally and then
if I add my jet set filter instant edit
and if I have any fellow youtubers
watching the best thing is you can also
paste your settings onto your video
clips so this is what my video would
look like normally just very dull
average colors and then
I just copy the settings develop
settings copy from one of my photos copy
and then click on the video develop
settings paste and that is how you give
your video clips a lovely cinematic
coloring so now you can see that's
exactly how you saw it in my lookbook
clips within the vlog
