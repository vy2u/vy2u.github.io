decided this week that I was going to
post a video every single day because
I've got loads of things on and it's
Fashion Week and I just thought it'd be
nice to you know give my channel just a
load more videos hopefully give it a
little bit of a boost you know how can
it hurt so you will already have seen so
this hopefully is gonna go up on I don't
know Saturday not really sure but you'll
have already seen loads of videos this
week so I'll link all the videos I
published this week down below there was
Primark haul there was some vlogs that I
filmed last week some really fun ones
and H&amp;amp;M beauty haul and a collab with a
beautiful beccarose so yeah just go and
check out all of those but today is the
first of my like busy days of the whole
Fashion Week thing coming up and first
of all this morning I've got some photo
shoots or a photo shoot with Jay
McLaughlin who is the guy that does all
the photos for Olympus and he's just the
most incredible photographer he's shot
like supermodels before he's shot for
Harper's Bazaar I think probably even
Vogue incredible photographer so I've
packed my little bag and I've got my
first outfit on which I'll show you now
and just heading to South Kensington to
take some nice photos with Jay but yeah
let me just quickly show you what I'm
wearing
excuse the mess behind me little Dexter
decided that he wanted to sleep in my
dressing gown so didn't have the heart
to move it so I'm wearing a white blouse
it's like a white oh this is distracting
the camera focus just don't move that
that's better so I'm wearing a white
blouse from Oasis it's just like a
normal not really sure how to describe
this material it's kind of like a cotton
canvas e-type material really nice and
then it's got the detail on the sleeves
which hold them up which is great
because I like to have my sleeves rolled
up this juillet is I think my favorite
thing of autumn/winter so far it was 29
pounds from Dorothy Perkins I'll link it
below if you wanted to buy it yourself
and it's so soft I absolutely love this
Sheila it's got like them kind of like a
snakeskin suede e effect and beautiful
waterfall detail which I just love jeans
are another bargain I think these are
about 29 pounds or maybe like 22 pounds
even from boohoo calm and then my shoes
are I think they're a brand called miss
Papp I believe that's what it's called
and yeah I will link them down below
I think little Dexter is is gonna spend
the day chillin at how much your little
boy is you are
mummy hate saying bye-bye to you she
does but mommy's got to go I love you
okay so I have officially been the
world's worst blogger today I finished
my photo shoot with Jay which went
really really well but I didn't have
times do any working in between the
shoulders but I can't wait to put them
up on the blog about to see the mother
and now I'm in John Lewis I just had a
meeting Peter at Liberata and behind me

pop-up in genre synopsis Street to say
I'm launching in John Lewis which is so
so exciting and I'm about to get my
makeup done right Theresa next time you

Charlotte Tilbury counters here for
another couple of weeks so definitely

for the virtual sinners and yeah so
perfect man at the makeover so just
Godzilla forestry station and live

double Morphin for the Birchbox dinner
my face is just to make myself more in
good so we're now just going up to
document for dinner with Birchbox and
we're incredibly excited
so definitely cool and an investment
here by having a penis I
scary
the menus
my tea is ready our countrymen video I
think Mike was going in the one
I know that your point on I'm sending it
hey guys I'm really sorry so I
completely forgot to end my vlog
yesterday just completely asleep when I
got home as you do it's quite a late one
at the end of Birchbox ended up going
home that midnight no to me so it's a
next day and I've just had our first
meeting at arts of Street I'm now just
walking towards benefit or on the street
see if they can sort out my brows which
are looking pretty rendered and then
I've got more meetings rest of the day
so I'll take you along
eyebrows probably the quickest to brow
experience of my life I literally did in
five minutes people just amazing and
then they just made for my brows upwards
I don't know too scary and now it
literally is about to go to beauty
breakfast end up with Eliam through but
for now we're just going to go to the
boo boo breakfast and
we're now on Charlotte Street about
debts you wonder
Bradley shines
see you wave of dogs yes I was like
don't eat olives dad look we have a
little Bradley don't change bags and
blue toys problems gonna love this
and we're about to have hot dog
disgusting
we ought to find out revolutionary
injuries
I'm judging by this and I listen
and I am finally home this afternoon has
been such a long one with events and
meetings and now I'm really happy to be
home
with my little boy who is just trying to
escape from the camera he lost a little
man so it's been a really hectic
afternoon as I just said and it's been
pouring with rain and all my carrier
bags decided to split so had a bit of a
nightmare actually physically getting
home and none of the busses on time
because everyone was getting the bus
you're all full but I'm so relieved to
finally be home as I thought before I
finished the vlog I will just couldn't
show you some of the bits which we've
got from the events today X has some
really nice pieces so the last event
that I went to was the rimmel event and
they basically launched their new
lipstick and it was all about the
lipstick revolution which is quite fun
idea Georgia May Jagger is funding the
campaign and they showed us all the new
imagery I got a little goodie bag full
of new bits and bobs let's have a look
at what's inside okay so it looks like
I've pretty much got the whole color
collection they said they were going to
color match us I'm guessing that's just
for the foundation because it looks like
I have all of the new lipsticks in here
and loads of the lip liners as well
which is amazing and I also got some
nice goodies from the girls at Radley
the lunch that we had today was all kind
of dog themed because they have brought
out eight new doggy bag doggy bag and
you have a guy that's shaped like a dog
which is absolutely gorgeous and so to
celebrate we went to bubble dog as you
saw earlier and also in the goodie bag
it's all kind of like doggy sealed
things so we have got a daily spritz
which is like a conditioning and
moisturizing freshness spray the dog
Dexter definitely needs that there is a
mini shank like a bone tasty treat we've
got a buffalo they called Buffalo's the
guards outside Buckingham Palace and
it's really soft like sheepskin on the
other side so Dexter is gonna love that
and finally a cute little collar which
hope you all fit him none of the colors
I've tried so far actually because he is
so tiny if you can hear some rustling in
the background it's him trying to attack
a bag of popcorn so he's not doing very
well he hasn't managed to open it yet
but maybe a mentor change so think I'm
now just going to run myself a nice
relaxing bath and wash
I heard all that kind of stuff and then
crack on with some emails before going
to bed so I'm gonna end this vlog now
and the next time you see me in a vlog
will be for London Fashion Week which is
something really really exciting so if
this one's been a little bit boring then
I promise I'll be making up for it and I
will see you in the next one all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
