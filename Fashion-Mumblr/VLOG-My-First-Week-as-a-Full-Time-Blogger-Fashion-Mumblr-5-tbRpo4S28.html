this week as you might have guessed by
the title is my first week as a
full-time blogger and youtuber so I
thought it'd be a good opportunity to
vlog it so that you guys can see what I
get up to I don't know if this is going
to be a normal week because I've got a
lot of meetings I've got a lot of things
going on which I haven't been able to do
over the past few weeks and months at
work so I've combed a lot in this weeks
it's going to be a busy one I was
playing around on the settings on my
camera earlier so I'm really sorry for
like a bit yellow I look a little bit
like a Teletubby in the viewfinder so
hopefully I can edit this to look normal
but yeah we're still figuring these
things out so today is Monday and I
think today is going to be the most
boring day of the week starting off on a
good one but I'm actually about to head
back to Gloucester I'm going to meet my
mom and the dogs and we're gonna drive
to Gloucester together to visit our
accountant because changing jobs I need
to sort out all the tax and all that
kind of really boring stuff but I
thought seeing as I was going to vlog
the whole week that I take you along
with me today so just come into my
soon-to-be blogger office room because I
just wanted to show you my newly tidied
makeup collection so this table here is
usually absolutely a pigsty just rammed
full of products and on my snapchat
yesterday I didn't if you saw it news
name is Joe CLD and like my Instagram if
you're not follow me on snapchat
but basically yesterday it was Sunday
and I was in a really productive I
didn't really know what to do mood so I
basically tidied out all of my makeup I
tipped out everything onto the floor and
got rid of loads notes duplicates I had
some makeup in there which I probably
had since I was about 16 if not earlier
side shop towel loads and loads of old
makeup which was such a cleansing and
refreshing experience I'm really glad I
did it so now I'm just going to switch
the cam around so now I just have this
Muji drawer with all my brushes on top
and a few things which is just too
pretty to hide like my Erin body
moisturizer and then I have lip balms
lipsticks eyeshadows this is mostly
concealers but a few additional lip
glosses I didn't have room for anywhere
else and then we've got mascaras and
crayons and this is the drawer of things
that I want to use more often
then in this drawer down here this
drawer I used to not be able to shut so
I'm really really pleased I can now shut
it and this has got the majority of my
makeup in it things which I still use on
quite a regular basis so everything else
is in there and this drawer is mostly
skimmed hair I've got a few primers and
serums face wipes and then I also put
all my mini perfume samples and extra
thought it's really useful to have them
like when I was at beast festival over
the weekend I didn't want to take I'll
hold perfumes I just took a few little
samples with me outfit the day is a
relatively chilled out one because as I
said I'm just going to go stir with the
dogs I didn't want to wear anything too
fancy stripy top absolutely pretty much
and living this top it's from Jules and
really really loved it super comfy and I
really like the colors as well my jeans
are from boohoo I was actually really
pleasantly surprised by the quality of
these I've never made a boohoo order
before but really really liked them
they're very tight I have to say like if
you are between sizes then go a size up
because these are extortionate I have to
do like little please in the morning to
make them fit me and then my shoes these
are vans it was the office via vans
collaboration and like a pebble eat
snake print which I really really like
so I also wanted to quickly show you my
makeup I can't really get the lighting
right on my camera today so hopefully
you can see it alright but basically on
my eyes I'm not sure how well you can
see it but I'm using the Clarins ombre
matte eye shadow in the shade over which
if you saw my video which hopefully went
up on Sunday if all things went to plan
I mentioned this and that was really
King stripe I haven't used it yet I used
it for the first time this morning and I
have to say it's a really lovely shade
it's quite a light very very light
purple but more of an everyday purple
quite brownie as well I'd say it's
almost got a bit of like a nineties kind
of shade to it I haven't worn blue or
purple eyeshadow since I was about 16 so
not those 16 90s that would make me
really really older but um yeah I really
really liked it I thought I'd just show
you because I mentioned it in the video
and I told you that I would let you know
how I'm with it and I really liked it
but anyway I'm just going to finish
packing my handbag
and head to the train station mum's
going to pick me up from working and
then we're going to drag down to
Gloucester so I shall catch you a little
bit later
just got to Gloucester we've been
driving for about a couple of hours now
from Woking and we've just about hit the
countryside you're stuck in a bit of
traffic at the moment I think I probably
stuck behind a tractor or a potato
factory factory if you look in the back
behind me there's a little boy that's
Lulu and Coco look cool they've both
been snoring the whole way here so we're
gonna have to wake them up in a little
bit because we're just about to get to
the accountants so we're going to go and
do all the boring things and then I
think we're gonna head for a pub lunch
somewhere so I will take you along with
me to that one well we've definitely
arrived in Gloucester hello
and they've even got little kennels for
the cars huge
it's now got back to mum's house after
what feels like forever of driving we've
done probably about five hours in the
car today it's goes to Gloucester one
hour just to thing around Gloucester
getting to the accountant and then two
hours back - sorry we're not know that
mum's house so I'm just doing some
emails and a nice cup of tea
I really annoy me spilt water all in my
handbag
luckily my laptop's alright my cameras
all right but my phone is acting like
the middle button is just completely
stuck down it's constantly on Siri and
no sim cut so hopefully trying to put my
sim card in one cell phone see if
that'll work cause otherwise I don't
think I can get by for very long without
the phone so fingers cause you're gonna
sort that out and so I'm just gonna do
some more emails here now chili dogs for
a little bit and then I'm gonna head
back home just do a little bit more work
and see Charlie when he gets back from
work
so just got home and seeing us whether
it's so gross outside it's just rainy
and miserable and gray feels like winter
already so so to cook my favorite winter
meal which is macaroni cheese it doesn't
really look very appetizing right now
but I'm going to pop in the oven put a
crisp on top
morning guys so I'm sorry the end of
yesterday's vlog was a bit of a failure
I ended up going to massive food coma
after my macaroni cheese and basically
just passed out on the sofa while
watching Made in Chelsea so not so very
productive evening today I am up early
again it's about half past seven on
Tuesday morning and I'm all dressed up
ready scopes they have a top-secret job
in East London which currently tell you
much about what I'm hoping I may be able
to vlog a little bit behind the scenes
but I already know so I thought I would
just tell you where I'm off to in case I
don't get to vlog a bit later so another
quick makeup update I tried the new
commute chubby lash for the first time
this morning and I am really really
impressed I'd only really done a very
quick first impressions over the top of
old mascara before but this morning I
put it on bear lashes and I'm really
impressed it's just giving my lashes
don't know if you can see this is no
eyelash curler no eyeliner and I really
think it's given a lot of definition
really dark separated lashes so really
impressed with the Clinique chubby lash
mascara I click outfit of the day hue as
well I am wearing just quite a casual
gray multi shirt from whistles I think
I've probably featured this in my first
vlog but I really like it just seems to
go with everything so the necklace and
the ring are both from Swarovski
absolutely love these I just obviously
quite dressy pieces because they're full
of the suave Sookie crystals but I think
because of the rose gold and the silver
together they also make a really nice
day jewelry this little thing is left
over from be first of all even though
I've showered about four times since
cents won't really come off the white
jeans are just for a new look I think
they are the most skinny white jeans
that I own but I kind of have to wear
super skin proteins with these boots
because these boots outs that you love
them they are a gray suede like a dove
gray from a brand called heaven my feet
if you see at the back they've got like
a tie at the back but basically when you
buy the boots you have to give the
measurements of the wireless points of
your legs or the widest point of your
calf and they create the boots to
specifically
your legs but it doesn't mean that they
are SuperDuper tight so we've tights uh
be absolutely perfect what the jeans
really do have to wear your skinniest
jeans and my bag I'm sure you've all
seen spiderweb million times before by
Rebecca Minkoff marble tote which I
absolutely love
so you just wrap things up like this
shoot and now I've come to you an
apartment in North London where the
apartment and the condos have got
together to do a bit of a lot of
pampering and I just had my nails done
with my red carpet manicure which they
desperately needed doing sales perfect
timing I think I'm gonna go and get to
pizza to the food I'm them just a little
bit before my next event later that's
good honey we look around
morning guys I hope yesterday's vlog
wasn't too boring for you I know it was
kind of a mad panic going from one job
to meetings and all that so he wasn't
too boring hopefully today might be a
little bit more exciting however my
diary is also jam-packed today I have
got to head off to Reece which is at her
salon in South canaanites Ridge area at
first but a meeting there I think but
also getting our hair done hopes live
made zero effort this morning some bouts
head off to that now I am wearing the
most autumn your outfit in the whole
world basically because if you look
behind me
yeah that is rain and do not even leave
the Tiny's for the blue sky or sunshine
in sight so I'm wearing to show you in
the mirror so yeah really really
autumnal outfit I found this she lay in
Topshop a couple of weeks ago and I
really really wanted to wear it but it
was just too hot and summery a few weeks
ago but this is the first time it's come
out and I really love it it's what kind
of sheepskin although obviously fake
sheep she's pretty much even sheep for
us just on the inside and then it's
cream this is for most men to kind of
suede II but it's not it wasn't that
expensive and blue embroidery already
like this and then the rolling neck
which is normally reserved for like
deepest darkest winter I just wanted to
be cozy today this is from another
island I need to put some jewelry on the
skirt is black suede this is from Miss
Selfridge
and then the shoes are actually really
struggled with what shoes to wear this
outfit I haven't got my boots down from
the loft yet so I've just won these and
it's the ones which I got in the Oasis
sale I don't know
but yeah basically picked these up for
an absolute bargain from Oasis so that's
the outfit of the day
so just finished my lovely blow-dry it
the resale on absolutely
show your face I was out and about today
so give me some lovely soft curls and
they use the orb a moisturizing
treatment beforehand which is really
really nice so I'm just now walking to a
bus stop next stop it's Baker Street and
lunch meeting at the national kitchen
I've eaten there one it's really
disgusting
first rolling up my love you pink
benefit fully and you're going to be in
really lovely liked me too much felt
more like the public I was catching up
at the natural kitchen on Baker Street
and now just got some beautiful rosewood
Hotel in our oven that's gonna have
really nice spatial but I'm looking
towards that feel like I definitely need
a bit pampering so let's go inside
such as had a really lovely facial at
the census far here at Brisbane hotel
and this part of their face place family
spa treatments I had a facial which
basically featured some extraction so
not wearing any makeup because it
basically spent the past half an hour
getting rid of all the dirt and
impurities from my skin and then had a
vitamin C mask put on as well so really
nourished and feeling very clean and
fresh at the moment as consumer I
believe the interiors of this hotel is
literally a blob is clean marble
everywhere really really need to draw
since Mitchell here do a few emails and
then I've got another meeting got enough
unity might put a little bit make
already for that but yeah so good
hello again so I've just come out of
afternoon tea at the Charlotte Street
Hotel which is really lovely I'm
most boring vlog because I didn't really
think about how many meetings so it's
gonna have this week but seeing as it's
my first week as full-time blogging I
just had to really crown all my meetings
into this one week because obviously
I've never been able to do daytime
meetings before and I'm now just on way
to a event would look fantastic so it's
their seventeenth birthday and we're
having a pampering session as the
Johansson salon and then we're going to
go out for a little party
so I've just had my hair refreshed by
the lovely Barney at the Johansson salon
so there's a load of bloggers here if
we've been invited by look fantastic and
we're all just pampering and getting
ready ahead of their birthday party
which were about to head off to is I'm
gonna go and get my makeup done at
benefit because obviously I had all
taken off for the facial so benefit are
going to do my makeup and then SEO here

makeup done by benefit and it's just
amazing
