vlog this week blog vlog I decided to
vlog this weekend because Charlie and I
have got a couple of really fun things
going on and today is actually kind of
one of those rainy Saturdays I haven't
really achieved very much this morning
so I thought if I start vlogging then I
might kind of spur me into action
tonight a few of the girls are coming
over and we're going to do the Color Run
which is around I think it's the Olympic
Park it's a 5k run but we've pretty much
decided that we're gonna just power walk
it because myself and one of the other
girls we haven't been to the gym in a
good few weeks let's just say so I think
a power walk it's gonna be better but
basically I think they're gonna throw
loads of neon paint at us and it's just
gonna be really fun I've just been
dexstar stop chewing Dexter likes to
chew everything Dexter where are you he
also likes to hide from me let's see if
we can find him later why are you under
the bed oh there you are
come here oh you're so cute yes you are
I hate still in the show are you should
we turn this into Dexter's YouTube
channel oh so I was just gonna show you
a couple of the bits that I got in the
post yesterday so I've got a couple of
really cool pieces so I'm just gonna
flip the camera round so that you can
see them firstly there's this diary
slash organizer which simple skincare
sentence may really kindly a little
simpler go on the first page and it's
basically a schedule and organizer ready
for the upcoming London Fashion Week
which is really handy so it's got like a
day-by-day diary and I love a good
schedule so that's gonna come in really
handy that I can just mark everything
down and then this one's quite random it
came from pop chips as you can see and
it's basically a cute little pack
lunchbox with a couple of packets of
their cheddar and onion potato chips
I've tried pop chips before but I've
never tried this flavour I don't usually
like cheddar and onion but I'm sure
these are really nice someone give those
ago and then there's also little block
of cheese which is really handy because
I wanted to make macaroni cheese tonight
but I ran out of Cathedral City so now I
have a Cornish extra mature cheddar
winner cute little cheese board
adorable Dexter already tried to chew
this so this is probably a little bit
small actually you know what I'll
probably put that in my picnic hamper
that'll come in really handy
nice snazzy cheese knife always useful
and then some caramelized red onion
chutney so guess that's what I'm having
for my dinner so last week I had Becker
over and a little pug Rupert and when
they were in this bedroom unfortunately
roofer decided that he wanted to take a
little weed on that and that's I hope
that's not Dexter doing away on it but
basically I've hit the rock the mat in
the wash and it went a little bit
crinkled you know how fur when it goes
in the wash it kind of all mats together
so I'm just now trying to unmask it and
have a look what Dexter is doing to help
out it's so cute yeah are you helping
it's proving rather difficult with a dog
helping I realized that in my last vlog
I didn't really finish showing you guys
what happened to the desk so I just give
you a little update basically because it
was really old desk which we then
painted white I obviously painted the
sides of the drawers but seeing as
Jeremy little boy but seeing us now that
they're painted the tools are a lot
thicker than they used to be I can no
longer get them in and out of the desk
so let me show you what happens now
basically they're all painted but they
just won't come out of the holes so now
I just have on my bedroom floor
all of these desk parts so tomorrow
we'll hopefully this afternoon if I've
got a bit of time I'm gonna stand down
the sides like my mum already did with
this one so hopefully I can get them in
because this is what my office currently
looks like really messy and it's
stressing me out so much
also in that vlog one of you guys asked
for a shoe collection video and I do
only think my shoes warrant a full video
so I thought I'd just show you in this
one so let me give you a little tour of
my shoe area so basically this little
corner of my room is where I keep all my
shoes I have the majority of them or at
least the ones I'm wearing most
frequently on these shelves at the top
those two black pairs they're both from
Rosslyn bran
these ones here are probably my favorite
boots they've got a lovely little wedge
bits and a nice heel and they just fit
really beautifully I think they're the
Highline boots they are quite pricey but
I absolutely lived in those last winter
the gray ones here you might have seen
me wearing them in my last vlog they are
a brand called Ted and Muffy and they're
the ones that they measure your leg and
so they fit you up see perfectly here
these ones are some gym shoes which I
actually got in a sample sale and I
couldn't believe it when I saw such a
classic design the sample sale I thought
that they would be super expensive but I
think I've picked them up for maybe
about 80 pounds and aware them quite a
lot some really thing that was a good
little bargain
these ones are some mules that I got
from Marks and Spencer and they've got a
really lovely spongy sole so really
comfortable and I wear these quite a lot
with like texture stop chewing next step
wait no stop chewing little mink see
step Cheerilee new employee here so I
wear these it's quite a lot of my dark
trousers then these are probably my
snazziest shoes these are some Charlotte
Olympia's I also got these from a sample
sale I don't tend to buy many designer
shoes unless they're in sample sale
especially these ones because they're
quite out there and I haven't actually
won these one yet waiting for the right
kind of occasion I've got some
researches here I really like the heel
on these they've got like a gold
snakeskin heel and they're really
beautiful especially in the winter I
wear them with lots of dresses some
modern chunky black heels from Topshop
these got a lot of use with maxi skirts
in the summertime in particular these
ones are also Charlotte Olympia and I do
actually wear these quite a lot they are
definitely my highest heel but because
of the whole like swinging 60s kind of
print I just find that they look a
really lovely whether it's with jeans or
a white skirt so love those next up and
these are actually little bit dirty I
obviously haven't clean them very well
since the last wore them they aren't
gold and white leather wedges from a
Kate Spade again I wear those absolutely
loads in the summertime
Dexter he loves chewing that bit of the
carpet don't you naughty boy these ones
on the end are just the most beautiful
color these are from Kurt Geiger and
they look incredible with a tan I picked
these up from the Covent Garden store
and I basically wore these all summer
they are so lovely next throw down these
were actually I lied these are my most
worn shoes over summer these are Oasis
and they have a really nice gold bit
behind the heel and gold down the side
and this heel size I find the most
wearable heel size and the fact there
has an ankle strap as well means that
they're really secure on the leg so I've
got a lot of use out of those these ones
are Carvel er I think I picked these up
in the sale last year and I don't
actually think I've worn them maybe once
or twice I think I wore them a few times
with jeans but then slightly fell out of
love with the color but definitely need
to wear them more these ones I wore a
lot in outfit the day shoots and
generally again a lot over summer I
absolutely love this whole chunky block
heel this is another pair with a chunky
block heel again all these a lot this
summer these ones are from Dorothy
Perkins I want to say however it says do
you know
I don't know I'm sure I got those from
Dorothy Perkins
and these ones are from the next I'm
sorry that's so dirty these ones are
from ASOS they actually bought two pairs
of these because I hold them so much the
first pair that I bought the heel became
all mashed up and basically unwearable
so I bought another pair when they went
down into the sale these ones are
absolutely loved these were 29 pounds
from Dorothy Perkins and I thought they
looked so much like Pucci sandals again
incredible little chunky book heel which
I love these ones you might have seen in
an outfit of the day shoot that I did
recently Topshop suede and this little
strap goes up the leg which looks really
pretty these ones here on my Charlotte
Olympia Kitty flats I love these I don't
wear them as much as I should do I tend
to just wear them around the house when
I have friends over because they're
green velvet I don't want to ruin them
but they're super comfy and I love them
this pair is from a brand called Pilar
Burgos which is a Spanish brand and we
actually met Pedro the owner where we
went to Seville and he really kindly
gave me a pair was just he was such a
lovely guy
we spent ages in the shop trying on
loads of shoes and I fell in love with
these took them up to the till and he
was like no you pay nothing he was just
so so lovely so I'm really grateful to
him and I wore these apps tons on my
holiday there's such good beach shoes
and then these are from Zara pick these
up because I was so cheap and I haven't
worn them that's the thing I always just
find shoes I love and achieve and I buy
them and I don't end up wearing them
this unit down here is pretty much a
dumping ground at the moment with the
dust sheets and my spray paints on for
the desk but inside here are some shoes
I don't worry as often but they're kind
of boring so I'm not going to show you
that these are by far my favorite pair
of shoes of my whole collection and they
are my Valentino rock stud shoes in a
lovely patent news material and you know
who puppy no little boy let's get out of
there
okay you can see the box with other
shoes so these ones are my favorite
shoes and definitely my most expensive
pair of shoes as well I wouldn't
normally spend that much money on a pair
of designer shoes but these I actually
bought for my graduation I graduated
from London College of Fashion a couple
of years ago and you know a graduation
or you can see as the shoes because the
rest of you it's covered in a gown so I
bought these I'm just going to try and
focus the camera that's better so yeah
these little boy so these are brought
for my graduation and I've worn them a
couple of times since you might have
seen them in my summer wedding get ready
with me video and yeah I will them to a
wedding and I've worn them for a few
nice events and occasion and since then
but I keep them in the box in the tissue
paper because I treasured them I love
them and yeah definitely my favorite
shoes
okay the hair is up which means it's
time for me to get on with something a
little bit more productive than showing
you my shoe collection as fun as that
may be so I have written down a bit of a
to-do list I find it really therapeutic
and just kind of gets me rolling when I
have it to-do lists and I also have some
blog photos to take I've just opened up
another little parcel with another
fragrance in it so I think I might do
that fragrance roundup so I'll show you
a little bit of behind the scenes of my
blog photography okay so the lighting is
pretty bad for blog photos today if you
look behind me not sure if you can see
but it's just
gray I'm miserable therefore I need all
the cups of tea today but for blog
photos I'm going to use my trusty lump
which I got it's it called a lamp
softbox it's called and I got a couple
of these from Amazon I only kept one so
yeah I'm gonna plug this in which you'll
see the difference this makes on my
bedroom full of the photos I think I'm
just gonna use my little semi temporary
dressing table behind me so I remember
in such a mess normally have tied it for
videos but you know of natural and all
that and but yeah basically I don't have
proper dressing table at the moment
because the room where my office is
currently being set up it used to be my
dressing table room so this is kind of a
terribly dressing table so I'm gonna
make this table behind me look as
photogenic as possible for this perfume
and makeup shot okay so I'm not sure if
this setup is gonna be any good it's not
looking hugely photogenic from where I'm
standing now but I might give it a go so
I've just used these gold boxes which I
picked it up from H&amp;amp;M as a way to just
break up the balance of the whole photo
is all looking very flat but the thing
is whenever you get roses they're really
beautiful but they're just too high for
new photos so I might do some nice
blurry background shots holding the
perfumes up in front of the roses it's
been a little while since I picked up
the camera I think the last time I've
vlogged was when I was taking some
photos and midway through the photo
shoot I had a knock on the door and a
couple of friends which I haven't seen
in absolutely months and months dropped
in I think it might have something to do
a little Dexter I seem to have seen so
many people that haven't seen in ages
since we've got this little man everyone
just seems to want to come in kiss him
so I'm just now tidying up because in
about 20 minutes time the girls are
coming over and we're going to get ready
for the Color Run so the girls are about
to arrive and I'm just getting ready for
the run and I've decided I'm going to
put on some of these new Ilia party
lashes so these are the frozen Beauty
ones I'm not sure if you can see where
they've got little strips of sparkle in
them so I'm going to apply these for the
night just put the lashes on and I think
they look really cool actually they've
got lots of flecks of glitter in them so
I think that should stand out when the
lights are honest tonight so I'm really
cheesed with those jelly's have arrived
his Vicky and Hannah and Dexter's been
getting lots of love but he's looking a
little bit lonely now is everybody
kissing you
yes ah lots of kisses and we have got
our color run t-shirts which are about
to chop up try and make them look a
little bit more stylish so we're going
to attack them with the sewing scissors
okay so you just left how you man me as
you can see you guys as you can see
we've got lots of place turn our faces
which the girls port and we're looking
really not mean if we do say there was
nothing there and because I did not want
to eat people just come to the shop so
we come to you get some chips which are
gonna eat at you
we managed to successfully navigate
through the shopping center without
getting too distracted and we managed to
find the Olympic Stadium which is higher
than it sounds
Hannah Joseph follow the orbit and was
like Isiah helter-skelter
I mean look at the orbit right now this
would literally be the world's most
extreme houses
we did really well two piggies
and then we're walking back through the
mall and we suddenly got a craving for a
burger so we ended up at Shake Shack now
and the girls are just left just chillin
with Charlie on the sofa he's watching
the rugby and I've got my little man
back so I think we're gonna head to bed
now so I will see you guys in the
morning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
