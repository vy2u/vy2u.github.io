day as you will have seen in the title
of this vlog today is the day that we
are picking up our puppy so Charlie and
I are incredibly excited we wanted a dog
for so so long ever since he moved into
this house every evening we've kind of
been like Oh imagine if there was a
puppy snuggling up to us on the sofa so
we are so excited and we love him so
much already we haven't even met him yet
but we can just tell that we're going to
love him so so so much
we've already dog proofed the house we
have got all the cables up from the
floor we've crawled around my hands and
knees making sure there's nothing that
he can nibble on or chew on because of
course he's gonna be really teething
when he gets here we have spent so much
money on Amazon buy modes of dog things
which I will show you a little bit later
but right now we're just going to go and
hop in the car and drive off to go and
meet our little man he's a couple of
hours away so it's going to be a little
bit of a long drive so I think I will
continue this little chat in the car we
are now on the road you just go onto the
I own this road I don't wait to go out
so now be a good time to do a little
what's in my handbag because I was not
noticing ready for picking up our little
boys I'm going to show you what miss box
we've got with us ready to take your
mark
first thing I thought is this really
cute blanket
with little particles on it one of the
girls said that when she picked up her
puppy the owners recommended
smell on
is going casting around so I thought
when we get that I'm going to leave this
with the mom and brothers
get that smell a little boy
Charlie decided to pack a notebook
because
organized and wanted to make notes thank
you darling
Charlie what it's making thanks Emma
many owners though tell you thanks a
notebook but
that's one
next we got a few laps I don't know if
I'm going to stop is
how's the way back fun
starts finding that maybe we'll be home
so impacts are
and it's really good so you can we need
open they're like what layer
how do you want to
the future
boo back just in case you do stop and he
has any little accident
little toys from episode
apparently these contours are really
good
it's a restream sheep from chakra like
it but Chinese get little teeth so
practice with us
this one is an edible - ye
functional masters like it
chicken flavor
another common toy is something the
brand of dog toys we're learning all of
these things and this is got little
holes in it's even filled with treats
we're going to treat spot he can show
this on the way home
yeah and that's about it one thing we
don't have news
harness because we audience of its mobs
off Amazon but they're all way too big
they were actually the same size as mums
docks
growls Cavaliere they're definitely not
going to fit a brand-new baby miniature
dachshund even if I actually said in
this video before we forgetting but we
are getting a miniature dachshund
absolutely gorgeous you've seen awesome
pictures up here it's really really
beautiful we're about half an hour away
now starting to get really excited to
meet our little boy we just stopped off
at the service station we didn't have
any breakfast before we left so I would
just grab some food I got
noxee dispensers strawberry smoothie
Charlie had a whole baguettes from upper
crust and a whole salmon sandwich Marks
&amp;amp; Spencer and an entire head with fruit
pastilles
which he only gave me one off
not writing
guilty conscience
and we also got some Krispy Kreme
Doughnuts
the breakfast is really good helping
staff today but yeah we just felt like
doughnuts we're about 10 minutes away
now in the middle of the countryside
surrounded by fields middle of nowhere
we're about to meet my little boy we're
so excited these last few moments just
me and Charlie until our lives change
forever and little boy can be snuggling
up to him every evening for about five
minutes the way now we are just
following a tractor of the hill which is
just making this weight excruciating so
the next time you see us we are going to
be with our little boy
are you ready to meet our little boy
so we're now almost home we've been
traveling in the car for a couple of
hours with our little boy Keaney and his
name is Dexter Dexter the dachshund and
he's been and crying a little bit on the
way home we think he might be a little
bit carsick but he absolutely loves
looking out the window he's a little bit
sleepy now but when we were on the
motorway he would cry a little bit and
then we let him look out the window and
then he'd be happy so he's definitely
definitely an outside boy on you little
man so as soon as we get home I think
we'll let him out into the garden a
little run around and he's probably bit
hungry obviously hasn't eaten since 7:00
we're about to take Dexter for his
first-ever walk outside the house he
hasn't had any injections yet so we're
just going to carry him to the common
and then let him run around just a dog
feet not gonna let him go very far he
did cry a little bit last night we don't
know if it's because he was in a new
surroundings or we do we know where
everybody was but you did do a little
bit of crime to you little man and also
as the SW Fall Festival last night so
it's quite a few loud drunk people
running around outside our house which
probably didn't help situation so little
men didn't get a terribly good night's
sleep did you
yeah but the good thing is that means
he's been napping Lots today so Charlie
and I can get on preparing for the
barbecue which we're having later well
are looking for we just have little naps
Ivy on them not sure if you can see but
he's actually wearing the world's
smallest harness it's so so tiny see and
he didn't first fall when we put it on
so he's obviously very well behaved and
looking forward to his walk I'm not
quite sure if I like this lead
I'm not sure
okay
Oh
one good quarters
this is where you to Dexter
meter month because where Dexter has
fallen asleep it is only about six
o'clock by his OC had a very long day
and he's just such a little cuddle bear
every time I sit on the sofa
he just Nestle's up or slowly whether
it's in my arm or next to my leg he just
loved that little bit of contact with
his mummy all his daddy just such a
little touch little lover aren't you
Dexter and swore it already feels like
he is starting to feel a little bit more
at home realizing that me and Charlie
are mommy and daddy and this is what you
have so I think I will wrap this vlog up
here and you should definitely check
back on Sunday because we exciting video
very special collab and this little man
will be intelligent
clever boys oh you're so clever you are
you're so clever so clever
such a lovely don't like to have my
tummy castrated</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
