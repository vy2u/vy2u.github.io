vlog Valentine's weekend and something
exciting going on tomorrow weekend
basically I'm starting filming now
although it's Friday not strictly the
weekend because I have a special guest
coming to my house in like I'm looking
arrest can't see my watch in about 20
minutes
basically her name is Makayla and she is
the VIPs celebrities spray tan up for
Vita Liberata and she did all the spray
tans for strictly and because Vita
Liberata are like those spray tan
partners of strictly so Michaela is
coming to town that my pale body shortly
which I'm really excited about I
obviously did get back from Costa Rica a
couple of weeks ago but you know when
you get a ton fast you fade it fast or
it fades fast and so I'm looking forward
to being bronzed again I could easily
get rather addicted to spray tans and
have them every single week but that
would be very what's the word I'm
looking for
spoiled no don't know very opulent of me
anyway so yeah Michaela is coming in a
minute I have done my pre spray tan
beauty routine this morning which is
basically a full-on body scrub from here
downwards with the rituals foaming body
is a shower gel thing and exfoliating
gloves and then I used the rituals
Himalayan salt actual scrub on any areas
are a little bit more dry like my knees
and my elbows and also weirdly like this
kind of shoulder area so I'm thoroughly
buffed and shaved my legs and all that
jazz so pre tanning skincare beauty
routine is complete and I didn't put any
moisturizer on because moisturizer can
be able to barrier and stop you from
tanning and we don't want that to happen
I think sometimes when you get really
good spray tans they put they put
moisturizer on like your knees and
elbows and sometimes your wrists so that
doesn't pick up too much ten I digress
um so yeah that's what I've been up to
this morning and I've also been filming
and and sorting out my bedroom because I
have so much stuff that I like beauty
products I need to try their I need to
review I need to photograph and so just
been getting my life in order at least
that starts the run of the day but yeah
I'll catch up with you
again when Mikayla gets here so Mikayla
is here now here she is and we have got
a wonderful setup going on in the living
room got a ginormous pop-up tent so
Mikayla is the wonderful spray Tanner
who works with Beetle virata and did the
tongues for strictly yes how many
seasons have you don't know
Oh four seasons so you've seen your fair
share of boot a yes yes a glowing skin
absolutely and so yes now it's my turn
and hey let's go let's do it we've got
an audience member who's going to be
making sure you'll do it properly mm-hmm
so before we start tanning I thought I'd
asked Mikayla a few questions cuz how
often do you have a celebrity spray
tanner in your house very often so
Makeda
tell me a little bit about how you
started spray tanning okay so my first
year I am heading as crazy it's a really
cool like a know your favorite person to
tan oh my god
and overall or just in general
Ephram super hard answer actually
because I pretty much I just loved
hunting everyone I do I'm amazing more
and more like a shoots and things and
I'm learning for shoots because yeah
gives me amazing feedback my lovely
friend Kelly Brooke is just insane and I
doesn't for tea yeah amazing so we do
lots of come to and we play and we have
some fun with it Betty yeah my god so
what you got down the leg thigh muscles
and they act really like add shadow
depth
muscle tone feel like you're gonna have
to put a six pack on me awesome always
oh my gosh
who's the sexiest man you have a spray
tan oh my god popping your boyfriend
shaky pros apart from me sorry sorry my
friend and stripping praise paint a BP
story for another half another time um
yeah probably the strictly pros their
bodies are insane insane and they just
love like you know in the hallway on a
Saturday night
imagine this hot steaming guy
all lined up in the hallway ready to be
contoured flexing their muscles the
girls are like oh my god oh my god and
then there's just me flick it away with
the tan sweeping it all over and didn't
even get chance to look at that blonde
gosh dancers bodies they are crazy
aren't they are crazy they work hard for
it though yeah absolutely it's a good
workout yeah I'm tell me so I've did a
little like beauty routine earlier I
told the camera earlier that I like
exfoliated and did mooster eyes what are
your tips for like anyone getting a
spray tan for the first time or like how
they should prepare themselves or the
best things to do
preparation is absolute key and I know
it's like super boring everybody always
says it to you but you must exfoliate
you must shave it's really really
important so you need a completely even
fresh layer of skin to apply your time
so that it can it he's evenly okay you
need to shave so that the pores are
closed 24 hours before ok then you might
this morning you won't be fine because
we're quite a few hours in what you
don't know is it 10 o'clock at night
yeah and then you need to put
moisturizer on it the moisturizer is
absolutely essential to go onto your
hands onto your wrists elbows knees and
feet and what that's gonna do is it's
just gonna add a little bit of a barrier
so yeah too much time it's gonna lay
onto those areas and then it's all the
fun bits mmm
and also moisturize every day afterwards
to the time avoid oil-based products ok
so not like a not like a baby oil or
like it's very no no no no either a
lotion or an aloe vera based moisturizer
mmm okay well over your body epidote it
and so what I always want to know and
what people always ask me is can you get
a spray tan before you go on holiday
will it stop you tanning obviously
doesn't have SPF in it but is it good
thing to do before you go on holiday yes
prime example and Paula and James
Jordans just went to Dubai I caught up
with him the night before they late so
these celeb mates amazing um and they
look insane when they're on holiday but
what you don't know is they had a lovely
visit of burrata Brazilians hand before
they left and as the days go on it
starts to wear off but you can tan
through so it has no SPF protection at
all okay please please remember remember
Texters obviously like shaking the temp
he's done their own on the sticky feet
right now just like I wanted man on the
sticky thing is so funny
we're gonna get like always probably
stuck to them always nine oh you tended
nine okay where were we
so it's so you I guess as a holiday goes
on as your spray tan fades you get a
real-time yeah just like one day some of
these starts to become real yeah and
then when you get back your tan has
disappeared and you are bronze rod ends
amazing well thank you Michaela for
lovely Ted thanks for having me I'm
excited to get my tan on
michaela has just left we have spent
like the past hour and a half chatting
about tanning about weddings about
everything under the Sun such a lovely
girls so I am now beautifully bronze I
didn't get her to spray it on my face
because make Vaughn and my tan on my
face never really last anyway because
I'm always try on different cleanse and
stuff but I literally this is the nicest
color I've ever been in my entire life
I'm going to go upstairs and show you in
the bedroom mirror because I feel like
the lighting is more true up there but
honestly ah I just want to be this Brown
forever can you invent a permanent time
please Beach Liberata okay I've just
come into the bathroom because I think
this is probably the best light we're
gonna get but I mean you can see my
chest is super bronzed kind of try not
to give you a cleavage flash hey Dexter
Dexter was so cute he was climbing into
the tanning tent after we're finished
spray tanning so I think he getting a
little bit jealous of my new bronze
color let me show you my legs as well
cuz they are super Brown no duh
look at that honestly this is definitely
the brownest I have ever been I asked
Michaela
I almost Michaela to just make me super
Brown I just wanted to be properly you
know a different color basically so I
asked Michaela to make me super duper
Brown and she was originally gonna do me
in Hawaii but she chose Ecuador so yeah
I feel honestly like I've been on a
three-week holiday and it was so nice
getting all the tanning tips from her
beforehand so yeah I'm gonna leave on my
dressing gown for another couple of
hours or something get on with some work
have some lunch and then I've got to
leave the eight hours before I wash it
off so that's what I'm gonna do um yeah
seriously though look at my legs so
Brown mmm brown eggs yeah morning guys

waiting for mom to get here and then we

michelin-starred pub that does the most
amazing roasts I think I've got a video
