day three of vlog Toba back home again
and it's such a stark contrast to last
time i vlog at home again and its back
to business straight away Charlie and I
had such an early night last night room
bed at like half past eight and I don't
think it was much after nine that we
fell asleep so really nice early night
and I was right in early this morning so
I need to go and get some breakfast
stuff but while I'm out I'm actually
going down to the boots and Bromley
because the Bromley boots is a really
big one and they have the boots beauty
Emporium there which is where they're
kicking off all the brow stuff so you
saw my brow video and a lot of work that
I've been doing recently is all building
up to the beauty Emporium so I thought
I'd actually go and visit one because
it'd be nice to just see it all come to
life and yeah I think my taxis just got
here so I'm gonna head off so let's go
okay you just got to the shopping so
that will do it in two I think I'm sure
I forgot they're wrong I'll write it
write it down here so I go to boot I've
just got my breakfast
they've just got to the beauty Emporium
here in booth and it's absolutely
massive look behind me you can see all
of the different stations this is the
beauty box station we've got like a
little gifting area oh my gosh there's
so much in here yeah it's all pink and
gray so very much my colors I match my
jumper say I'm gonna have a little look
around and see what they've got on offer
so many incredible services here and the
one that I am most excited about is this
little bad boy behind me and it is a
personalization machine which yes it's
colors advance and you can choose from
loads different products in the store
I'm thinking a real technique called
metal makeup brushes and you can get
them engraved with either your initials
or a message depending on how big the
thing is and how much room you can do on
it basically but they're given you a few
ideas here it's may have been where I
got my inspiration from so this is a
makeup brush and it's got um the Stevens
written I didn't get makeup brushes
personalized or perfumes or daddy those
are cute in the advert they've bought
thanks always making me smile written on
the Estee Lauder advanced a night repair
so Marwick you're watching maybe a
little hint of - what you go in grizzle
but such a lovely idea
I think it's 3 pounds of personalization
in the store book you basically pick up
a product go on paper to the till tell
them you're going to get it personalized
and they'll take the receipt off and
then you come up with you see Emporium
get it
how good is that what else can I show
you in this corner behind me is the
packing area really chic gray and pink
packaging gift boxes which are just so
and also some really pretty carry a bag
so nice if you're coming to dr. fonts
and presents and men this area I'm very
excited about because you know my love
of browse this is called the test and
play area that's basically a tsunami
testing station we've got loads of
products they picked out as being like
the key products and you can test them
as easy as that and choose your
favorites so I'm gonna have a little
play with come try this it is the
Maybelline brow satin I've heard really
good things about this and how little
play and see which color I need and it
works on my skin tone okay so this is a
little testing station you can see
they've picked out products here which
we can have a little play with so what I
really wanted to do is just try and find
a couple of products which will help me
create a lovely natural home everyday I
look because you guys know that I like
to keep things quite soft so I can see
they've got the benefit around mascara
here and hopefully yeah this is the
brown liner as well which should go
really nicely together perfect partners
so I'm going to give these a try
and then round here this is more of the
brow section there's a few bits and
pieces here that actually I've not tried
before so a good opportunity to give
them and go this one I've heard really
good things about this is Ready Set brow
so I'm just going to have a little look
at that one and also these colors are
just absolutely beautiful pretty much
like my ideal color palette so I'm going
to give these a little swatch from the
test and play area
this is a telltale sign of a true makeup
addict when you can't possibly go into a
beauty store and not come out with your
hands covered in it tester samples I
have discovered a few new shades in the
collection yeah eyes uncovered
collection palette with your new
favorite lovely colors and there and
then also which is really handy they've
got all the different shades of the
benefit precisely my brow pencil so if
you're not too sure which shade is going
to be right for you because very
important then get the right pair of
shades you can come and just swatch them
and figure out which is like a glove so
this little seat behind me is where you
can come if you actually want to have
some want to show you which products
work really well on your brows so
especially during busy times like
weekends you can just come and plunk
yourself down and what is the install
Navy so I'll give you a brow makeover
and have you decide which products are
right for you it's really really handy
and they've also got some tutorial
videos up on the screen behind and these
are also available online so you can
check out the
tutorial videos online too and then this
little station I am very excited about
you can put together your own makeup
palette so if you are bored of carrying
a blusher and eyeshadow or highlighter
contour then you can scrub one of these
palette they come in rose gold and make
the matching shoes fit that you want to
put in the palette I'm gonna have a go
doing that myself and then I might test
out the personalization machine by
creating my own personalized makeup
palette
so now that I've picked my eyeshadow
blush highlight and contour selection
I'm going to build a beauty box so I've
got all these products to choose from
and I can choose three so very very
tempting to get a new benefit vodka lash
mascara because these are one of the
subscribers I've never tried always hand
each other and backsides version
existing they've got so many nice as a
base as well so really good fun you see
a few of these I have not tried this one
before this is the perfectly clean
triple action cleanser toner makeup
removers and definitely a grab one of
these such a good opportunity to try
things you've not tried before so that's
been in my book and I've actually just
run out of my trouble version of the
Estee Lauder advanced night repair so
that's going to go into you know what
I'm gonna grab a benefit dandelion blush
because I never take blush with me when
I travel this it's so big
but it's a little cute binky one so
these are my three beauty items of
choice okay so I've got my goodies and I
would come back to the beauty Emporium
to get some bits and bobs personalized
so I'm gonna get my Real Techniques
powder brush with my initials on because
I always lose it and then picked up and
they'll know it's mine and also my
lovely makeup session rose gold palettes
we're gonna sit
and finished let me show you the final
products although I'm not sure we about
to see because my camera does not like
metallic I've got chain as written on
the top of my makeup brush which I use
like everything's already but I use it
every day for powder under my eyes so
now I have a personalized one and then I
also have my palette personalized you
can see down here it says josie salad so
I have got my shopping in my beautiful
boot Emporium goody bag which is
beautifully gray and so so I just got
back home after my little shopping trip
to boots and I thought I'd show you the
bits and bobs I picked up because I know
it wasn't terribly clear when I was
install all my bits and bobs I showed
you earlier but yeah I just wanted to
show you again how cute is carry it back
it's it's so lovely
definitely keeping hold of this one and
the green pink is obviously the colors
that they're going for because I've got
the beauty box as well in this beautiful
little pink color such a nice way of
getting people some gifts if you want to
treat them to a few new goodies
and as I think I mentioned you get three
items in your box so I got the Estee
Lauder cleanser that I haven't tried
before the serum that I'm running out of
and the little blusher dandelion blush
from benefit so really good for my
travel bag and then this is where it
gets really exciting so I have my
palette I haven't put the things in it
yet you can see how it kind of works its
way around
rose gold makeup obsession palettes oh
hello it's really weird sing your face
for a different angle and this is
personalized to say Josie's palette and
if you can see that that gosh stuff like
Inception you can see my camera so yeah
that is a service that is three pounds
in store so really good value really
good as we can't to crisp up also as I
showed you earlier my rose gold Real
Techniques makeup brush with jf on it
I'm just so chapter about so beautiful
and so affordable as well and then I
picked up this Smashbox that because
it's just full of loads of different
essentials you've got the primer photo
finish primer you've got a highlighter
and mascara and an eyeliner and I picked
it up because the guy that was doing the
personalization Joe he was kind of
showing me how it works and he
personalized a Smashbox Smashbox
lipstick lid for me so this has got JL
followed my initials so I thought it'd
be rude not to pick up the kit so they
can use it and then also in my bag I've
got loads of these makeup obsession a
little I don't wanna call them samples
little palettes which you stick in the
big alright so I'll be filling this up
now I've got a range of eyeshadows I've
got a contour I've got a blusher a
strobe powder and then also highlight as
well so I'm fully stocked up and it's
great because I can just take that on
hande with me and not have to take lots
of different individual pieces so yes I
feel like I did a very good boots haul I
was also trying on lots of the eyebrow
products but I didn't pick any up
because I'm quite well stocked up with
eyebrow goodies it's a really really
good and successful shopping trip and
the boots emporiums are in some of the
larger flagship stores but a few the
smaller stores also have some kind of
activities going on too and you can
check out the store locator on the
website to see which store is closest to
you and if you can get down to an
Emporium then I highly highly recommend
it because just such a fun shopping
experience I hope you enjoyed coming
with me now I am going to get on with
some work I've got tons of emails to
catch up on gonna have some lunch and
edit a few videos so I'll catch up with
you guys a little bit later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
