touch me
we know you wanted to hello my darlings
welcome back thanks for joining me for
today's video it's going to be a bit of
a tour of my walking wardrobe so you may
have seen a couple months ago I did a
whole vlog about the process of building
this wardrobe it used to be kind of and
nothing room we had a few odd bits of
furniture in here
we had a wardrobe in here another
wardrobe in that room and another
wardrobe in our bedroom storage was just
a real issue for us in this house so we
decided to create a bespoke walking
wardrobe we had sharps come over and
they helped us with every stage they
started by measuring the rails and
figuring out how much space we needed
and then we worked together to design
what is now our perfect walking wardrobe
so if you want to see that whole process
I will leave that video linked up on the
screen and down below so you can see
what this room looked like before and
the process of designing what is now
I've trained walking wardrobe this room
is split into two so this side is my
side the best side and that side over
there which you can't see at the moment
but I will do a pan is Charlie's side we
both have loads and loads of clothes and
what we do is switch the Wardrobe up
seasonally so what's in here at the
moment is my winter and a little bit of
spring clothing the bits that I've added
to my collection recently and what I'll
do in a few weeks time is go up to the
loft bring my spring/summer things down
and put away my thermals my scarves
things like that to really maximize the
space we're quite lucky that we do have
a big loft in this house and I'd rather
have this set up than having all of my
clothes down here at one time because
that could be a little bit overwhelming
so let me know if you'd like to see an
updated wardrobe tour when I have my
spring/summer bits down so I am really
really pleased with how this room looks
now it's still a fairly small room but
we've really maximized all the space
this section here is all hanging space
I'll show you inside in a second and
then over here we have got a chest of
drawers which has got a beautiful window
see area as well which is just a
beautiful design detail and I think it
makes this room look very girly very
feminine and all
so really relaxing too so I'm going to
start by showing you what is in my
hanging space so let's get started
so this is like the main wardrobe
section that the area that I reach for
clothing wise every single day the bits
I wear on a regular basis I'm pretty
sure you guys will recognize a lot of
these pieces the finish that we chose
cotton over the exact name of it they'll
leave all the finishes and everything
linked down below and that's also
mentioned in our building the wardrobe
log and but it's like a light gray color
which i think is really beautiful it
could have been a little bit clinical if
it was white so I'm really happy with
the gray on the handles here I have
little D or christmas-tree charms these
were in the Dior beauty advent calendar
and I just thought it was so cute that I
kept them on the door handles inside
these are my most worn pieces so as you
can see your color palette wise it's
very me very white lots of blush pink
slots of creams just my absolute dream
color palette so we've got pieces that
as I said I reached what every single
day lots of really classic layering bits
for this time of year we've got things
like my lovely ruffle row necks I've
also got a few of my jumpers hung up in
here such as this one this is a
favorites from Club Monaco it's one of
my most worn pieces lovely roll neck
cashmere jumper and then I also have
some things which just look really
pretty even though they should
technically be in another section like
my Club Monaco feather juillet that's
another favorite we do have a lot of
knitwear pieces in here at the moment
but I imagine when the temperatures
start to rise this will be filled with
silk blouses lovely t-shirts cami tops
things like that so we'll see how it
changes as the year goes on some of
these pieces will probably stay in my
wardrobe the whole time the whole year
through and such as things like this
it's a high-neck top from reese but I've
pretty much wear this all year round I
have a grand total of one a black item
in this section of the Wardrobe this is
a lovely little Kate Spade top it needs
some serious D fluffing at the moment
but this gorgeous ruffle detail on the
sleeves so that's my Y token black right
this is something that fairly new this
is from Ted Baker this is a
spring/summer piece so I got this
recently obviously don't want to shove
it straight into the laughs so that's
going to stay in here throughout the
rest of the year so this is the main
section most of my hangers are rose gold
I have a mixture of wire hangers
I get a lot of questions about these
that often Primark so I have a mixture
of wire hangers and then also this
slightly thicker hanger which is like a
Velvets and also blush-pink
also from Primark so I have just those
two and then at the top I'm quite OCD
about spacing my hangers I like to have
them quite even I think it makes it look
a lot more neat and tidy so that's that
section underneath that we have my shoes
when we were originally talking to the
shops designers we thought we might want
to get drawers pull out drawers so I
could see the shoes at the back but then
when the surveyor did all the
measurements and the calculations we
realize that actually the best way to
maximize the space was just by having
these shouts and I'm more than happy
with that solution so I've got three
layers as I mentioned with the clothes
these will all be changed when it comes
to spring/summer I have my sandals
whereas now it's mostly boots and closed
toe shoes so if you have my favourites
and well this section is my trainer
section I only have like four or five
pairs of trainers but this is where they
live I've got some closed toe meals
these are some nice ones from Topshop
that I wore Christmas I've got some of
my boots back here I'm not too fussy
about which shoes go on which shelf but
um these are some lovely Ted Baker boots
next shelf down this is quite a full
shelf full of boots we've got my
favorite Topshop could she boots these
these are a pair that I was kind of uh
mning and aren't about so they actually
go with so many things I reach for these
a lot I've got my caramel and sock boots
these are probably my newest pair of
shoes and I wear these absolutely though
it's very very versatile and then I have
got the pair of Cloe boots these are see
by Chloe I don't wear these as much as I
should I definitely need to get more use
out of these in fact I probably could
have worn her this morning cuz it's
snowing I've got my two pairs of Nicolas
Kirkwood gold Aladdin shoes I call these
this is the pair that Dickens chewed and
I love them so much that I then bought a
new pair so you can see the older than
you
I also have the Nicholas Kirkwood shoes
in pink maps that you love those at the
back here we've got my lovely pony skin
leopard Gucci mules really excited for
the temperature to warm up so I can wear
these again these were my first ever
designer shoes these are Valentino rock
studs very battered now I did actually
treat myself to a second pair but these
are my first designer shoes and I bought
these for my graduation so I'll always
remember those very fondly I do still
wear them but they're a little bit a
little bit battered and then my respray
mules I wear these all the time they
just go with absolutely everything again
probably my most worn shoes so big fan
of those and then above my main clothing
section I have got some handbags this is
kind of the larger bags and also the
bags that I don't use that regularly so
for example we have got my okay Bennett
bag is beautiful light pink colored bag
absolutely love it it's a little bit too
big to go on my other shelves which I'll
show you in a second
we've got my Kate Spade bag this
beautiful velvet bag I absolutely love
again it's a little bit big to go on the
other shelves so yeah that's one half
bag section I'll show you where the
other handbags are now this is my main
shelving area and when we were designing
it I said to the designers that I wanted
somewhere where a few of my bags could
be on display a few of my favorite shoes
could be out on display because
previously all of my lovely bags and
shoes were just kind of shoved in the
bottom of a wardrobe it wasn't a very
good way of storing them and I did want
to be able to see them as well so now I
have this fabulous storage area and
starting at the top I just have a Viktor
and Rolf box up there that was from a
recent blogger event I can't reach the
top shelf so there's no point in putting
anything useful up there so that box
just fills the gap next shelf down we
have my crossbody bags which are
slightly bigger a few of my favorites
we've got my Valentino glam lock bag
this was my first Valentino handbag and
I absolutely love it and then I've got
my singer on sunset bag this is a really
lovely one that I have been wearing a
lot recently and then
we have got this little mulberry this
one I've picked up from the MacArthur
Glen designer outlet up in Cheshire Oaks
and then looking a little bit sad squash
to the side we've got my mulberry Lily
bag I actually packed this in a suitcase
with a magazine next to it and the
magazine kind of melted onto the bag so
if you look closely it's got some stains
on it which is such a shame but this was
one of my first designer bags it's very
scratch very battered it's got a tampon
inside I did very recently film a
handbag collection video so I'll also
leave a link on the screen if you want
to see more of my bag collection next
shelf down we have a pair of shoes on
display these are some lovely
embellished shoes from Ted Baker I got
these for a recent project that I worked
on with Ted Baker and I think they were
far too beautiful to be hidden away so
these out on display and then I have got
a few perfumes on display as well I
don't usually actually wear these
perfumes they're more here because they
are very pretty I have got this lovely
personalized bottle or fictional flower
bomb from an event that I went to with
them at Christmas I have got another
flower bomb in the other room but this
one is just for display purposes we've
got a couple more perfumes a Jo Malone
lime bass and mandarin reed diffuser
some matches for the candles they've got
on the windowsill and then I've also got
this little deal makeup looks like a
Hollywood star this was actually the
invitation to their Christmas dinner and
I just thought it was so beautiful that
I wanted to keep it in this little area
and then on the next shelf down we have
another couple of pairs of shoes that I
did not want to hidden away these are a
pair that I got for Christmas or a
Christmas they are pink velvet and
feathery pink shoes from and Other
Stories and then we have my second pair
of Valentino rock studs I went for this
almost rose gold
calfskin leather this time my first pair
were patent
these are without a doubt my most
comfortable heels of my whole collection
I called in my running shoes because
they are so comfortable if you are
looking to invest in just worn a pair of
designer shoes I would hand on heart
recommend these so so much they are
incredible and they go with everything
you just elevate any outfit so love
these as you can tell and then we have
the newest bag in my collection this is
from strawberry it's in the fros
collaboration with strawberry and this I
believe is the east/west mini bag it's
so gorgeous the color
I adore it's slightly different for me
because it has a silver hardware most of
my bags are gold but I'm not averse to
mixing metals so a big fan of that one
and the shell for though that we have my
slightly smaller bags a few of my real
favorite surrounding here sorry about
the leggings by the way I just came back
from the gym and having a very casual
working from home day today so we have
got my smaller bags here my clutch bags
shoulder bag still from my wire cell
this is one of my envelope bags still
love this a special evening events and
then my Chloe Niall handbag this again
is one of the new ones in my collection
I wear this so so much I love the fact
you can just like pop it over your wrist
big fan off that one I have another gold
bag I find that gold bags go with so
many different outfit combinations this
is my Valentino Glenn lock bag I've used
this a lot in fact for stitching it's
starting to come loose on this one it's
very well used we've got a lovely silver
little aspinall bag this is the lucky
bag and Aspinall clutch bag and then
also this gorgeous little one from Ted
Baker with the bow on it which i think
is so so pretty and then down below that
we have got a shelf with three Aspinall
bags this is I kind of pulled this my
bowling bag it's got this lovely pearly
detail on there I haven't used this one
so much but I definitely need to and
then we've got my two trunk bags which
if you follow me on instagram you'll
have seen these a million times over
absolutely love both of these two and
down at the very bottom I always have a
pair of boots that aren't where they
should be and these are just the ones
that I've been wearing a lot recently
these my lq Bennett ones and what they
are hiding is this kind of messy area
down here which is where I keep most of
my hair appliances so I've got my
curlers my hair brushes do you
understand need to get like a little
basket for all of these pieces but have
not done that yet so now these cover it
up and make it look good
Meeta so we're going to move on now to
this section here and this is a full
length rail so in this one this was a
half length rail half height and then
the shoe shelves this one is a full
length rail so what I keep in here at
the moment is my winter coats so I've
got all of my long coats in here
a few of my favorites include my Kate
Spade one this I got on my trip to New
York with Kate Spade and this one has a
slightly thicker hanger this is a purl
hanger also from Primark so I have mixed
it up a little bit in here this section
actually goes all the way to the back so
the coat so I use less regularly are
hidden right at the back I've got some
slightly smarter coats at the back there
like my silk Reiss coat which is kind of
like a dress coat and I've got things
like my super warm woolen overcoats like
this one from Reese just loads of
gorgeous very very warm coats so yeah
when it comes to spring time I will
probably switch this out for maybe long
dresses something like that so yeah
that'll be a fun day when I start up my
wardrobe and then down here we have got
my open e boots this is where I keep
most of my over knee boots I do like to
put shoe trees in them so most of these
boots have got something inside them
which just keeps them looking their best
and once again this section goes all the
way to the back so I have a lot of
opening boots there's probably 10 pairs
in here these are my studio Weitzman's
probably my favorites and then we've got
my Karen Millen ones which actually do
not have a shoe tree and need to get
some more so yeah this section is just
filled and then at the top here we have
got my large bags and also the bags that
I don't use quite so often at the moment
so we have got my Kate Spade baby it's
cold outside bag I use this bag all the
time during winter and I've only really
just swapped to my mulberry Bayswater I
like to put bags inside bags here we've
got my Michael Kors satchel bag we have
got the Russian doll of handbags this is
my mulberry Cecily bag inside that I've
got a Tory Burch tote and inside that I
have got a singer on tote so bag in a
bag in a bag just to keep them
stored safely in this top section and
then my final hanging space is this area
here so this section has got my half
height coats so we've got things like my
dress coats these I normally just wear
for special occasions like this lucky
one from Ted Baker and then we've got
things like my she lays my reseal a that
I wore all the time it's getting a
little bit too warm ish to wear this now
but I will this so much during the
winter months
other half-height coats my Ted Baker
we've got my reversible reseal a fur
coat from revolve and then this section
is kind of split into two so that's my
half height cuts and then we've got a
random scarf and then we have dresses so
these are my kind of not below-the-knee
dresses above about any dresses we have
got things like this new one up into
Baker
I haven't actually worn this one out yet
it's very new but I will definitely wear
this when it comes to springtime I know
it's head Baker dress this is my needle
and thread dress I basically wore this
to all of the special events over the
Christmas season I walk to the BAFTAs to
the fund fair I've just wanted up that
you know it's definitely got its money's
worth and I put it in the sale to double
bonus I've got some slightly smarter
work dresses in here like this one from
Karen Millen and then my huge selection
of jumper dresses I have a lot of jumper
dresses
I've got also this lovely one from
Zimmermann smarter dress here from Ted
Baker Club Monaco Reese Ted Baker Zara
etc etc so yeah that's where I keep my
dresses and then if you look down here
you can see I have got things hanging
this is like a double rail section so
from here this is all skirts and again
these are kind of my winter skirts so
we've got things like my midi skirts I
try and fit at least two on each hanger
to maximize space my M&amp;amp;S one and other
stories and this beautiful one from
tecnica leather skirts like this one
from and other stories are Ted Baker
so Reese oh my goodness this skirt I
have not worn it in years but I keep it
for the memories because I actually wore
this skirt in my first-ever blog outfit
post so I keep it just just for the
memories if I can find you and I insert
a photo of my first ever outfit post on
the screen here as you can see I think
you've changed and then a few more
skirts this one I've got actually in
Greece sample sale a couple years ago
and I feel like Brown though the skirts
just keep coming back into fashion so
when spring rolls around I will
definitely be wearing that one again
then after the skirts we have got some
folding hangers and I keep my trousers
on here
why do you pack quite a lot of trousers
on each hanger so on this one you can
see I've got my Kate Spade leopard
trousers which I'm obsessed with and my
Reiss leather trousers the most
expensive trousers in the world I've
also got some white jeans on here which
are very much ready for springtime coast
ones and these are from a few seasons
ago from Reese but they're so beautiful
you can see like floral kind of a cute
detail on them and then we have God
couple more pairs of trousers got my
Karen Millen faux leather trousers on
one side and then they've got the
stretchy material on the others they fit
absolutely beautifully and then we've
got my blush colored briefs trousers
whichever way a lot recently absolutely
love those I then have a few more skirts
we've got a few that I've been wearing a
little bit more recently like my new
Reese metallic skirt and then there's
beautiful one from coast with a sheer
overlay and the pearls been wearing
those two quite a lot recently and then
we have my shorter skirts again one's
ever wearing a lot recently this is from
the Club Monaco these hangers are
actually from Zara way more expensive
than the Primark ones and not just good
so yes not impressed with those Reese
web skirt again very regular you're
wearing that one okay Bennet to Madison
London Topshop old school a sauce and
that was the first thing that I put in
like a whole video on YouTube so again
keeping that on for the memories and
then here we've just got three jackets
I've got my Reece suede pink jacket
which I absolutely love and was
definitely wearing again in spring this
is also from Rhys it is a brown leather
jacket I don't wear this very much I'm
not really another jacket person but I
got this one I used to work
I think it's I think it was about 400
pounds but I got it way less than that
because I use my stuff discount and then
I have got my River Island faux suede
jacket which I really really like and I
wear this I actually wear this quite a
lot at like summer barbecues and I don't
want my real Reis suede jacket to stink
I absolutely love it and they have got a
very similar version out now so get
shopping so that's this section as you
can see it's kind of cut half-height
here because we have got the cushion
seat down below but it still means that
I can see everything so that has been
really beautifully designed at the top
of this section and by the way the
lights are really clever when you shut
the doors they go off when you open the
doors they come on amazing they are all
kind of like connected through at the
back up here I have just got some shoe
boxes I do actually have a few pairs of
shoes in some of these boxes like in
this box I have got I don't wear these
very often actually because they're
really uncomfortable but they're so
pretty let me show you these these are
my Nicholas Kirkwood flats with a pole
in the heel if you saw my first romantic
lookbook you'll have seen these two ball
that's another rather I should probably
keep out my gosh I actually forgot how
much I love these so they look like this
they're absolutely beautiful they have
got a rose gold cap and then the back is
like a pink suede and they're just so
stunning
yeah I'm gonna keep these out as well
this is a great bad idea I'm gonna have
a room full of shoes now the other box
is up there I've got some boots from
Russell Bromley and the elk a Bennett
Jenny Packham bridal shoes I got those
as a result of a collaboration that I
did with LK Bennett's so yeah generally
just boxes up there sorry if you can
hear background noise by the way we have
got George's dog little Pepe in this
room and Dex from Dickens downstairs
needed methane and Dex from Dickens are
being a real pain in the butt
currently scratching on the door being
very very needy so any background noise
I apologize
cannot control the hounds and then
finally we have the window seat section
starring little puppies and this is
actually this was in a fabric that they
didn't originally have and I really
wanted something a little bit
so they sourced this and now sharps do
sell this as adorable and now show ups
duelist this is one of their fabrics so
absolutely beautiful and then I've got
the little button detail inside I think
it looks quite Parisian French style
absolutely love underneath here and I
have got six drawers and I've got the
things that I fold so for example in
this drawer we have got my winter
accessories this is my thermals I've
also got my bubbly ski hats my burberry
scarf a lot of my scarfs are in here as
well as other winter accessories like
earmuffs things like that to be honest
the most used thing in here as my
thermals which I have quite a lot of
what do you think that'd be this one
down here has got really scruffy and
very badly organized I'm afraid but this
has got my like slobbing around the
house trousers my casual wear and female
scarves all of the drawers are soft
clothes as well which is great then we
have got some more jumpers I've got a
cashmere jumper from Club Monaco Zara
jumper all in this one this side we have
got a few more jumpers these again are
jumpers I tend to just wear in the house
Topshop Anthropologie Coast loads and
loads of different pink and white themed
knitwear and then I have got some
trousers down here so these are some
great leggings from River Island I have
got another pair of gray suit leggings
which I haven't even worn yet from Zara
and I don't have many jeans you guys
might have noticed I don't wear jeans
very often this is my what is solitary
pair of jeans down here so that's pretty
much what I keep in my drawers I decided
to make the room look a little bit more
pink by putting some pink cushions in
here just got some plant ports I've got
a couple of candles that smell
absolutely amazing this one is from
Christian Philippa and then I have got a
flower bomb candle in here as well what
do you think Pepe and then this side is
Charlie's side not as exciting as mine
but I'll show you very very quickly in
case your boyfriend is watching and so
in here Charlie has got who doesn't mind
he's not here at the moment he's got his
jackets woolen jackets he's got a belt
rack here he's keeping his suit covers
up there
and then he's got his huge ridiculously
huge selection of suede bomber jackets
what guy needs as many suede bomber
jackets like literally it's ridiculous
it's got pink he's got rust he's got
Burgundy's got cocky
Navy yeah bonkers and then down here we
have got his main section it's pretty
much a mirror image of mine he also has
pink and rose gold hangers from Primark
because I got them for him you've got
all of his knitwear I think he'll
probably do the same as me and swap it
as we get into springtime charlie is the
king of Rome acts so there's about 10
million roll necks in here grain green
maybe burgundy every color roll neck and
then he's also got his shoe section and
look at this he's got this like glasses
section for his spectacles and his
sunglasses like a shop and on this side
he has got his ties his rugby tie he
doesn't have that many tires we don't
really go to that many events that
require ties and he's got his shoes and
then this is his like shoe cleaning
section Charlie's quite OCD when it
comes to protecting his shoes so he's
got liquid proof he's got those
different suede sprays which I do steal
and use soft close doors and then
finally this is Charlie's shoe section
he's a big fan of Chelsea boots so he's
got this whole shelving section for the
Chelsea boots again in every color
imaginable this man honestly has so many
shoes so yeah and then finally we've got
the back of the door not very exciting
but this is where I put the coats that
I'm using on like a daily basis this is
my very very soft and loose down feather
I think it's goose down or like an
artificial version Ted Baker I went to
gym my skull my Rhys will encode this is
just the outer where did I reach for
every single day so that's pretty much
the entire walking wardrobe room and I
do have one rail in the other room which
you will know if you watch my normal
fashion videos and that's like my new in
rail so I'll put things in there on that
rail if I want to photograph them or if
I'm not sure if I'm going to keep them
yet I basically have this rule
where if I don't wear something within
three weeks of buying it I send it back
so I keep the things that I'm unknowing
about on the rail next door so there's a
little bit more clothing there but yeah
that is everything I really hope you
enjoyed looking around my walking
wardrobe with me let me know what you
think down in the comment section below
give this video a thumbs up if you would
like to see a spring update a part two
and also subscribe if you would like to
see a house at all because I'm thinking
