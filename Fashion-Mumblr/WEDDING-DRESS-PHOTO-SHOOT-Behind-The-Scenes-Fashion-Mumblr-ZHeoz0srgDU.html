given for this day
yes I'm single Oh won't do mingle my
friends
good morning and welcome to a new daily
vlog I thought I'd bring you along today
because it's going to be pretty fun day
we are heading out of London to banbury
in Oxford through a road trip or a
fabulous photo shoot
so we've been invited by a British
culture bridal designer named Philip
alleppey to watch behind the scenes of
her photoshoot she is creating imagery
for her I believe it says spring/summer
2018 at dresses and do you know what I
can't say that I've ever really been
behind the scenes of a photoshoot that's
gonna be this Graham so very excited to
see how the pros do it obviously when
Charlie and I do our shoots it's just
the two of us and on photographers it's
gonna be very very interesting behind
the scenes in cafe bathrooms not so
glamorous but we are going to a fabulous
property called Ain Ho Park and it looks
absolutely stunning so it should be a
fabulous fabulous place for the shoot
perfect for bridal gown photography and
Charlie and I are also going to be
shooting a few outfits as well we have
filled the car up with a few different
outfits because we just have to make the
most of this fabulous opportunity we're
just in traffic and we have two cars to
the left of us and Charlie and I are
pretty sure they are secret agents
inside the cars they have very
scary-looking security with their like
microphones and earpieces in the guy in
the back looks like someone new to see
in mock mafia coming to life so we're
taking the cx-3 out for a nice long road
trip today stretching her legs we've
only done a few short journeys in London
and just visiting
family homes out in Surrey it's 65 miles
to banbury so it's gonna be a nice long
a car journey I have whacked on the
heated seats because it is a very chilly
January morning
another thing we love about this car is
the Sat Nav we just type in a postcode
and it's so easy to see easy to use
actually a good answer a bit and
something yeah the best thing is this
heated steering wheel Oh sounds like
sounds like quite a random thing but I'd
imagine it's genius when it's this cold
dying I don't think the steering was
heated I think is this oh I stand
corrected there is a heated steering
wheel button so I haven't actually
driven the car yet because I have not
driven for about five years for the
safety of others yes
but I am going to learn and I'm probably
going to vlog like refreshing my driving
skills so let me know if that's
something that you would like to see you
because this is such a small zippy not
small but a good-sized car for living in
the city I want to be able to just - out
if I want to go and get a facial or go
shopping I want to be able to zip about
in this car we had the cx-5 previously
which we absolutely love but I think for
me of relearning to drive this is a
really good-sized city car it's easier
to park in the cx-5 yeah I think for you
as someone that's not driven for a while
it will be slightly more yeah I think
I'd feel more confident parking this as
well because it's got the camera in the
back of the car so when you put the car
into reverse you can see behind you on
screen on the dashboard so lots of
technology that make it a lot easier and
it would make me a lot more confident
we've just arrived at the beautiful
house and China I have been shown up to
this rather fabulous bedroom which is
going to be our kind of base for the day
as I mentioned Jai and I have got some
stuff to shoot here and we're also
getting some behind-the-scenes clips of
Phillip Phillip please a beautiful bride
or photo shoot we've just had a mini
tour of the house as well all of the
rooms are different themes so there's
seven main bedrooms up on this floor
this one that we're staying in is just
absolutely gorgeous you've got this big
copper bathtub in the bedroom I will
show you a few more of the rooms as we
go through them to shoot I think with
the bridal photo shoot they're just
changing the dress now topping up the
models makeup so I'll get some more
clips when she's in dress number two
she's been going on for a couple of
hours now this is the kind of
behind-the-scenes area where everyone's
getting ready we are now fighting for
the light obviously it's January it gets
dark at about half four but luckily the
room where they're shooting in is super
light super beautiful so I'm gonna go
and see how they're getting on hopefully
we've got another hour left of lighting
okay it's about half-past five now and
we are just doing the last of the ships
I thought I would quickly show you some
of the bedrooms here because they are so
stunning this one is probably probably
my favorite it's very white floorboards
quite Parisian got this big Kate Moss
picture up on the wall love this little
arm our total house goes to me and then
we'll post bed double your sofa area
humongous mirror show you
bridal suite right here could be you're
getting ready very much a turnout so
this I guess would be the room way you
can get ready with all your bridesmaids
is amazing big mirror here great for
doing your hair another fabulous
bathroom in there and this is a huge bar
it's like a walking bar how cool is that
amazing this is another bedroom with a
huge walking wardrobe area total house
goals
I think someone's staying here so I'm
not gonna pry in
welcome back your leis It's A Wrap at
the photo shoot and Charlie and I are
now making our way back home
a little bit quicker on the way back
because someone put the wrong dress code
in on the way there so we did have half
an hour to our journey
I'm already editing at the photos that
we shot today I just can't sit still for
more than now are not do anything
productive so I'm busy editing and the
shots by looking at gorgeous Philip his
wedding dress designs just looking at
was really stunning in real life they
were something else but on camera as
well they look absolutely gorgeous it
was a real honor to be able to see
behind the scenes and look at these
dresses up close I can't say that I've
ever really looked in detail at a
wedding dress before
like I've been why do you go shopping
with my friend Sophie but obviously she
was trying them all and I didn't want to
be like inspecting them but this time I
was looking up closely at all the detail
she had embroidered silk shawl shares it
were ostrich on stretch feathers just so
many incredible details and I was
speaking to Philippa during the shoots
and she was saying that she's a real
perfectionist and just loves all the
details love's all the embroidery and
the lacing and the beading so it's just
fabulous to get to see it all up close a
girl couldn't dream to own one of her
wedding dresses but yeah it was a
fabulous a day out today we are about to
cross the bridge south of the river and
we just can't
please together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
