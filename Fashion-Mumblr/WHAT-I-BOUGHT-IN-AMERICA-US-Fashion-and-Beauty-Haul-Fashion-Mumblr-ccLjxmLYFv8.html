floors
don't do too many can you guess our best
hi guys welcome back thanks for joining
me for today's video I'm going to be
sharing with you a little bit of a USA
shopping haul so these are the pieces
that I bought during our recent trip to
Boston and Vermont it's quite
predictable it's Club Monaco Sephora
Victoria's Secret and a little something
from Banana Republic as well these the
shops that I always beeline for either
they are much cheaper than they are here
in the UK or we don't have them in the
case of Sephora so I didn't go wild in
places that we do have here in the UK
for that reason and I'm going to get
started with Club Monaco so we went if
you are familiar with the Boston area we
went to the Cambridge side shopping mall
to start with and it was a really
beautiful store they had 25% off when
you spent over $150 so that to me was
just like a red flag to a bull a hand
was basically my excuse for buying a few
pieces so these are the main bits that I
bought I did actually film like a trial
session in my Boston outfit arias videos
if you'd like to see my instructs
perience and trying them on and my
opinions then then I'll leave that link
down below and on the screen here as you
can check that out if you want a mini
come shopping with me but these are a
few of the pieces that I ended up
purchasing so this is a beautiful
feather juillet I actually did a little
bit of research and I spotted this on
the Club Monaco website before heading
into the store and I totally beeline for
it I think it's so beautiful in the
pictures that I took for Instagram and
for my outfit Diaries video it looked a
little bit more cream but this is
actually the most beautiful very pale
pink color which i think is just
stunning I love wearing G leis at this
time of year it's great when you're not
so cold but you want to bundled up in a
coat but it just adds that extra layer
of warmth and a really nice piece for
layering as well if you want to add
a little bit more interesting maybe a
fun texture to your outfit I think it's
perfect for that I can't remember the
prices off the top of my head for all of
these pieces and not to mention a 25%
discount but everything that I mentioned
will be linked down below so you can
just click on those links if you like to
find out the prices and any more
information yeah I thought that was a
really lovely piece that will hopefully
elevate a lot of my autumn outfits now
this next one I tried it on and I
absolutely fell in love with it I wore
it um I think I wore it around Boston
the day after I got it my all so starved
up with my leather trousers for a
slightly more glamorous evening look
however I have to say that having worn
this now a few times it has left me
rather disappointed so firstly which is
the front this is the front it's not
hugely obvious right now I'm not sure if
it's coming up on camera but there is
actually a pull here and yes it's
probably my fault that that pull
happened I do wear a lot of jewelry
that's likely to catch on things but
when you spend and I think this one was
quite a lot I think this one over $200
when you spend that amount on a luxury
piece of knitwear you just don't want
that kind of thing to be happening
straight away but I do appreciate that
that might have been my fault for what
I'm more disappointed about is that
these bows which are of course probably
the main design detail are actually
hanging by a thread they're meant to be
attached in two places but both sides
the bows have kind of fallen off and
they're gonna fall off and tidy
if I don't stitch them up so I'm going
to actually take this back to the Sloane
Square store that we have here in London
and see if they can do an exchange or
refund for me because you just don't
expect that when you're paying Club
Monaco prices so I have a bad note on
that one but I do think it is a
beautiful jumper this next piece I
absolutely adore and I got so many
questions and compliments when I wore
this and featured it on my Instagram a
couple of days after buying it so this
is a beautiful silky soft cashmere
jumper very high quality and then it's
got this bow detail down at the back
which is just so girly so feminine and
just a beautiful beautiful design detail
from the front you can wear it and you
can tuck it into jeans trousers
high-waisted skirts and you wouldn't
really know that it's anything unusual
it's a very classic style but then when
you turn it around you've got
the bows in the back which are just so
fun and just absolute beautiful very
eye-catching I'm gonna take extra
special care of this because I went to
last a long time I don't want any
bubbles or any catching going on on this
I won't be storing it on these wire
hangers don't worry I have got padded
hangers that's I will be storing it this
properly on I did actually do a blog
post last year or maybe two years ago so
please forgive the on school photography
all about caring for your autumn
knitwear and your cashmere in particular
so I'm gonna leave that blog post link
down below because I do also get quite a
lot of questions on how I care for these
more premium knitwear pieces so check
that blog post out for all of my tips
which pretty much are still the same as
they we're a couple years ago when you
naughty you have to come and sit on
Mommy's lap don't you they don't trust
you so this next one is the piece that I
picked up from Banana Republic I was
immediately drawn in by the ruffle
detail on sleeves I'm still such a
sucker for any kind of ruffle detail
whether it's on the collar on the
sleeves on the hands like it is on this
one I just love it this was also in
special offer I think it was 40% off so
I ended up paying around $45 for this
which i think is around 38 pounds ish
the exchange rate has got a little bit
better for us Brits still not too
perfect but just a really nice piece for
layering again I wore this under a G lay
so you could really see the sleeves and
or thermal underneath it as well so
really great versatile layering piece
for my autumn wardrobe we don't happen
on a republic here in the UK anymore
there used to be a store on Regent
Street but that has since gone we do
still have gap but I just don't like the
in-store experience that all I find like
manic so yes lovely to pick that up in
the u.s. whizzing back to Club Monaco I
picked up this scarf I have not worn
this yet and waiting for the
temperatures to drop a little bit more
and it is basically just a block four
into two different shades of pink
you've got a very very light pink and
then more a dusky pink which is pretty
much exactly as my jumper I just love
the shade of pink so much it's got a raw
hem detail to be honest
we'll probably bring something out for a
fraction of the price that's absolutely
identical and I'll be very angry but I
think that our where there's a lot so
I'm not too upset with the high cost
office item it was $98 which I know is
ludicrous for a scarf but I'm hoping
that the price per wear will come right
down as I think I'll be wearing this a
lot as the temperatures do start to drop
it's just very much my kind of color and
if I don't have any pink in my outfit
this will be a great way of adding and
my favorite color
so yes totally snuggly and wonderful and
I almost can't wait for it to get cold
so that what the final piece that I
picked up from Club Monaco is this
burgundy midi-length pleated skirt it's
quite a statement piece what with the
length and just the beautiful flow that
it has Sanks is really lovely high
quality material and the pleats are
quite dense as well as it really does
have the most wonderful movement check
out my Boston outfit Diaries if you want
to see video clips of this in action but
in general wearing this kind of skirt I
think is beautiful with ankle boots with
knitwear tucked in a really beautiful
piece that elevates your wardrobe for
autumn so the final two retailers that I
went into while in the Cambridge side
shopping mall were Sephora and
Victoria's Secret from Victoria's Secret
I basically just got five pairs of
knickers which you don't need to see
they were on the special offers and I
just find them really good for like
being invisible and also pick those up
and last but absolutely not least is
Sephora so from here I picked up a few
goodies I didn't really need anything I
just wanted to treat myself to a few
bits and bobs so the first thing I
picked up is the jet lag hairspray from
igk I was watching Lilly and Anna's what
they bought in America shopping haul and
they both raved about this there was a
smaller size and then this larger size
and I actually needed some tried shampoo
while I was out there so pick this up
really love the packaging and I have to
say it is really really good it doesn't
kind of make the hair feel all cocky
when you put dry shampoo in in fact it
really does make your hair feel better
than first day hair so I actually have
to say I prefer this to batiste which
I'm a big fan of so do love that so far
so good
and then the next thing in here I'm just
kind of grabbing at random I hadn't
bought anything from funky beauty but
then I saw these on the shelves and it's
the most boring thing you could possibly
buy from the face of beauty collection
but I thought I would pick them up it's
basically the blotting powders I thought
that this is a really nice little way of
presenting them in your handbag I always
had these little cardboard envelopes and
they get so battered I always end up
just losing them or throwing them out
thinking that they're rubbish but this I
thought it's a very nifty gadget for
keeping my blotting papers looking cute
in my handbag and I definitely won't
accidently check that out so it's very
boring types from French Beauty but
that's what I went for
next I topped up on a few of the
Anastasia Beverly Hills brow Wiz pencils
I always buy these may go into American
and sephora's because for me they are
the best eyebrow product and I've been
using other things recently because I've
run out of this so I picked up so I
picked up two to keep me going another
repeat purchase and as a beauty blogger
you have to really really love something
to repurchase because my makeup and my
lipstick drum ticular is overflying but
my favorite lip product of all time is
the bite Beauty mattes creme lip crayon
in the shade amaretto it's just like the
most perfect matte creamy shade very
comfortable to wear doesn't dry out the
lips and the color of the amaretto shade
I just absolutely adore so this is
probably the fourth one of these that
I've ever owned and I will probably
rebuy this for the rest of my days then
we have a couple of new things that I
had not tried before but I was very
tempted by in the store firstly Marc
Jacobs Lamarck liquid lip care this is a
I think it is a matte lip product but
it's got a lot of nourishing ingredients
in there so it should be really nice to
wear during the autumn months when
perhaps our lips need a little bit more
love and care beautiful shade brownie
pink as you can imagine from me I don't
really push the boat out when it comes
to lip shades and the last two products
are both from its heart Tarte is really
hard to get hold of here in the UK we
can get it from QVC but it's not the
full range I picked up the color splash
rainforest of the sea
stick in the shade Sunkist and i
swatched so many of these and decided to
go for this shade packaging I'm not sure
if I love the blue and that's what's
inside I really do like the formula of
this lovely and barmy for a fairly matte
lipstick so again should be nice and
comfortable and then color wise it's
slightly more of a coral pink than what
I would usually go for but I thought to
be very flattering in the Sun once I
know I'm kind of planning ahead here but
I thought it was a beautiful shade that
I could not resist and last but not
least I picked up the Tarte buried
treasure eyes shadow palette this one
again I was watching for ages and I was
choosing between this and I can't
remember the name of the other palette
but it's kind of like a rectangular one
but inside this one also the packaging
is absolutely beautiful very kind of
Arabian style with this almost tile
print inside the shades are absolutely
stunning these the kind of shades I use
on an everyday basis and they all have a
slight shimmer to them so potentially
really nice to wear during the festive
seasons a little bit more sparkle to
look and then some really beautiful warm
colors as well we've got like a rusty
shade a pinky move a pinky Brown color
and then almost like a light look as
well as some very wearable light brown
shades to this I think I'll get a lot of
use out of and because it's a bit
smaller than the naked palettes for
example should be really good for
putting in my overnight bag for any
trips light out coming up nice and
portable and a big mirror and the lid
too which is always very very handy so
I'm looking forward to wearing this and
no doubt you'll see it in the upcoming
makeup videos here on my channel so
that's everything that I picked up in
the u.s. I'm actually off to New York
next week so if you feel that I've
forgotten anything if there's anything
that I desperately need then let me know
in the comments below and I'll add that
to my shopping list for New York thank
you guys so much for watching
do give this video a thumbs up if you
enjoyed it and for more beauty and
fashion hauls and I will see you in my
next one but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
