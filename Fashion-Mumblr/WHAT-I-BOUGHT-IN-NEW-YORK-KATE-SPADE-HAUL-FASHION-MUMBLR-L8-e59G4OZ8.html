amazing pieces there's that's notice

my Instagram stories in order to be able

giveaways like this and it's going to be
really fun so definitely keep an eye on
my Instagram from now or especially from
the 1st of December if you want to be a
part of my giveaways and they're going
to be open completely worldwide alright
so now that my notices are answered the
way it let's get started with the haul
so as you may know I actually went to
New York as a guest of Kate Spade which
was definitely a highlight in my
blogging career I love Kate Spade so
much it's on my favorite brands I've
loved them for as long as I can remember
it's one of my favorite brands of all
time so to be invited to New York with
them was just an absolute dream come
true so these pieces that I've picked up
are actually a mixture of gifts that the
brand very kindly left me in my hotel
room another pinch me moment they
so gave us a gift voucher to spend in
one of their flagship stores and then I
also bought a lot myself as well so just
for total clarity that's where these
pieces have originated from so let's get
started this first piece was a gift it
was left in my hotel room so so so
generous and it is a beautiful gray
velvet handbag I absolutely adore this
bag I think the shape of it is so
practical I don't have any bags like
this in my collection and it's just so
so beautiful it's got really lovely
chunky chain straps and a little clasp
here and then inside pretty spacious I
was able to fit my vlogging camera my
purse my daily essentials and I wore
this most of the time we were in New
York so huge fan of this another thing
that I love about this bag is that the
chain isn't too long so if you're quite
short like me it kind of just hangs in
the right place you can obviously double
up the chain and wear it over your arm
if you want and the SIRT a few photos of
me wearing it in New York here just so
you can see how I styled it as well next
up is a pair of glasses Kate Spade
eyewear selection it's absolutely
beautiful and this pair I thought was so
stunning I really loved that whole geek
chic look so when I tried these on I
absolutely fell in love with them
I don't wear frames all the time but
when I do I like them to be real
statement pieces so these I thought were
absolutely beautiful I know you guys
aren't used to seeing me wearing
obstacles so let me know what you think
of these next is something that I bought
in the I think it's the Madison Avenue
flagship store everything comes a
beautifully wrapped up in tissue paper
this is part of their Christmas
collection so Kate Spade not only do
they do fashion and accessories and
eyewear but they also have some really
lovely lifestyle home bits as well which
is why I love them they just cover all
bases this is what I picked up from
their Christmas section which was up on
the third floor of their flagship store
and it is as you can see a sausage dog
Christmas tree bauble charlie and I like
to collect and Christmas tree baubles
that will remind us of certain trips and
certain occasions so this will always
remind me of my trip to New York or
visit Kate Spade it's a beautiful white
ceramic with these little doodles all
over it and then you've got a Kate Spade
little
on the top there so just very delicate
very pretty
I'm very plastic too so I'm looking
forward to decorating our tree with this
in the next few weeks or so the next
thing that I bought from the flagship
store is an iPhone 10 case or iPhone X
whatever you're supposed to call it I
don't yet have the iPhone X I actually
wanted to buy it in New York but no
Apple stores had it yet so or they had
it but it was totally sold out so I'm
just gonna have to keep a hold of this
one until I do manage to get my hands on
the new phone I got it with the clear
back but with some gold kind of confetti
circles on there thought it is a really
beautiful style I would say nine out of
ten of the phone cases that I've ever
had have been Kate Spade I always think
they do the cutest designs and this is
no different I think my first ever
iPhone case was Kate Spade and I'm just
so impressed they already have the
iPhone 10 case they also on it when it
comes to phone cases this one is called
the confetti rose gold foil phone case
and yeah means to hurry I can get my
hands on the iPhone 10 so that I can use
it next is another piece from the Kate
Spade eyewear collection and it's a pair
of sunglasses we were so lucky with the
weather in New York who is beautiful
blue clear skies and very very sunny so
I have a couple of pairs of sunglasses
this is a rose gold pair with a little
cat flick on the edges which I love I
find it suits my face shape very very
well and I wore these a lot on the last
day they're quite big for my face I do
have quite a slim face but I love
reflective sunglasses I love that when
you talk to people when you're wearing
reflective sunglasses they don't know
where to look because either they get
like mesmerized by their own reflection
they just get a little bit flustered so
yeah that's something really tragic that
I find amusing about mirrored sunglasses
next we have a notebook this was another
gift that was waiting for me in my hotel
room by the way if you'd like to see
what we actually got up to on the trip I
published my New York outfit Diaries two
days ago
I'll leave it linked up on the screen so
definitely check that out so you'll get
more of a vibe of what we actually got
up to but yeah so this is a cute little
Kate Spade notebook I thought perfect
size from my handbag it says put in a
good word I absolutely love Kate Spade
stationery I think it's great for those
that just love the brand maybe the price
points or the handbags and clothing a
little bit too high but you still want
to buy into the brand the stationery and
phone cases and things like that are
amazing for that certainly for me I just
go crazy for their stationery this I
thought was absolutely beautiful it's
got gold foil on the edging and then
just a very simple lined notebook I like
having a notebook in my handbag because
you never know when inspiration might
strike in meetings it's nice to take
notes I think in here at the moment I
just have my to-do list on the first
couple of pages so I like to just write
down on my thoughts that stops them
chugging round and round in my head so I
find my minute look very very useful by
the way sorry it keeps getting lighter
and darker though I'm filming this in
natural light and it's a very weird day
the Sun is either super bright or super
dark so apologies for the weird lighting
next thing to show you and a lot of you
already spotted this on my Instagram and
you told me that you loved it
it is this gorgeous bag that says baby
it's cold outside I got this from the
flagship store I thought it was
absolutely beautiful and perfect for
this time of year personally I like to
carry a small bag with me that has my
centrioles in it that it easy to get to
my Oyster card my phone my vlogging
camera and then for the rest of the
stuff that I like to check around with
me all day I love to have a big bag with
me so this one fits my extra layers if I
want to have like a scarf with me or
something it fits my laptop generally
all that kind of stuff that sometimes
you want to have with you if you're out
in town all day it's made of a kind of
felt material you've got the stitching
in there and then you've got the gold
Kate Spade logo embossed in like a gold
metal there inside it's just got this
one zipper pocket for your valuables and
then it's just really big and open it's
got my receipt at the bottom of here as
well the handle length is really
practical it can go over your shoulder
even if you've got loads of layers on I
think I had this chunky knit and a coat
and then this still managed to get
wedged over my shoulder but they're not
too long that the bag can't be carried a
full arm's length as well so just a
perfect bag very very useful and I'm
sure I'll get a lot of use out of this
over the Ottoman winter months this is
one thing that I definitely did not need
I have a whole kitchen cupboard full of
thermal flasks but I couldn't resist it
because it was a Kate Spade in New York
special so it's a coffee mug keeps your
coffee warm all day which is great
during the winter months and it's just a
New York special so it's got the
Flatiron District the flower district
and I just thought it's really cute
design so I picked this up and I would
look forward to using this on winter
walks and things like that now this
might be a little bit lame to some
people but if you're obsessed with
stationary like I am you might get very
excited over this it is a desk kind of
organization kit from at Kate Spade so
in here there's so many nifty little
pieces you've got paper clips you've got
pins you've got a highlighter a pen
post-it notes mini post-it notes which
are so useful for like keeping your
recipe page for example some clips and I
don't even know what those things are
but I'm very excited to play with them
this is another thing that I absolutely
did not need I probably have all of
these pieces in my desk but it's just so
adorable having them all together
I think if you know any stationery
lovers and you want to buy them
something really special for Christmas
then this would be a really lovely gift
idea too but yeah something that I did
not need but it makes me very very happy
so as I mentioned Kate Spade has home
things as well as stationery fashion and
accessories I picked up a couple of tea
towels that say eat cake for breakfast
on them because if I can inject a little
bit of Kate Spade fun into my kitchen
then why not so I actually got two of
those one of them is going to be a gift
next in my little selection of goodies I
have this little box and this is how
your jewelry comes presented if you buy
it from the Kate Spade stores in here I
have three pairs of earrings actually I
have two pairs have just realized that
one pair is upstairs also in here in my
little pouches so everything also comes
in these cute little pouches I brought a
couple of pairs of earrings this pair I
thought just very classic pearls of the
little diamond underneath them obviously
not a real diamond I also thought that
the Kate Spade jewelry was very well
priced so these were $38 which i think
is around 30 British pounds so that was
pretty good for a pair of pearl and
they're probably diamante earrings I
just thought they were very elegant and
classic and then in my second little
pouch another pair of earrings very Kate
Spade these are giant Swarovski crystals
and they look like they kind of have
rose gold foiling scattered over them if
that mate
since I will insert a close-ups you can
see them but they're just very beautiful
delicate designs that I think will make
a great impact so very very pretty these
again $38 next up we have a Kate Spade
candle I love their candles I find them
the most beautiful scent and this is a
really classic one so it's in their
white votive and I think it's a
lemongrass flavor it's very very fresh
that's for sure
yeah this one is called Park so as you
can imagine it's kind of freshly cut
grass a little bit citrusy very very
fresh and definitely quite unisex as
well so Charlie won't mind me putting
this around in the lounge
it's just very subtle with a Kate Spade
logo down there and the Kate Spade
iconic green color inside too before I
forget I'm going to mention the clothing
as well so this one I actually chose
before going out on the trip it's a
beautiful black fitted knitwear piece so
I love fluted sleeves as you guys know
and this has photos which i think is
just such a lovely design detail you've
got this little knot detail up on the
top neckline and then other than that
it's kind of like a plain polo neck
jumper so very practical I wore this
with a gray and felted skirt throughout
the trip so over the screen now I'll
show you a few clips of me wearing this
in action
I also styled it with my Club Monaco
feather juillet and I loved how they
look together this is a real classic
piece so no don't be seeing me wearing
this a lot in upcoming outfit Diaries
etc and probably my favorite piece of
all of these pieces is my new coat so
this I just think is so beautiful very
very classic it's got faux fur around
the collar and on the sleeves - I will
this a lot in New York you may recognize
it again from my Instagram as soon as I
got it I just wore it a non-stop it's so
warm because you've got this gorgeous
filter material it's lined it's got big
pockets and then on the bottoms they're
these big embellished diamante gem
effect buttons which is just as a
fabulous touch to the coat because it's
great I think it's very versatile but
the faux fur and the buttons just give
it some really lovely details - this is
quite an investment piece but I think
because it's such a classic design it's
one that you were so much so price per
wear on this and I think should be
really really good this was another gift
that was left for us in our hotel room
it is a toiletry bag black and white
stripe and inside there very
left us some shampoos and conditioners
which was very helpful because I
actually forgot mine so nice and roomy
for your essentials a zip fastening and
then again you've got the little Kate
Spade metal logo up at the top that ok
this is a really fun one I spotted these
in the flagship store and as it was so
cold I always get really really chilly
ears so when I spotted these I had it to
get them they are a pair of earmuffs
black and white very classic with pearls
on the headband which is just the kind
of design detail that I really really
love so I wore these I do actually find
it really hard to hear anything when I
have earmuffs on I wore these on our
last day the whole day so it was really
really chilly I think it went down to
about 10 degrees which doesn't sound
that cold but in New York it gets very
windy that was pretty chilly and I was
very very thankful for the ears and
we're getting to last few pieces now I
bought this from the flagship store it
is a card holder the amount of times
when someone is asking you for a
business card and I've not had any on me
and I find that very annoying and
slightly unprofessional so I thought I
would treat myself to this so that at
least I have an excuse to keep my cards
well protected and with me at all times
it just says hello on it and other than
the black hello it's also rose gold so
very pretty this again I think would be
a really lovely stocking filler idea so
everything that I've spoken about me
link down below in case I'm inspired you
to pick up anything either for yourself
or for a gift
the final clothing piece is this
adorable jumper says baby it's cold
outside that's obviously one of the
slogans that Kate Spade are rocking this
season I have a feeling this is sold out
but I will try to find it and link it
down below for you because again when I
was on Instagram you guys absolutely
loved it this does come with a pair of
black jogging bottoms I haven't actually
worn these yet but they'd be really nice
to wear on aeroplanes or just lounging
around the house but it is the top that
I love the most and in the bottom of my
giant carrier bag I haven't even been
able to pick up the carrier bag yet to
show you this is what I bought
everything home in the bottom of the bag
is just a few more pairs of glasses
firstly this round pair which I
absolutely adore I think the round shape
is beautiful very kind of throwback to
the 60s they do definitely make a
statement but I absolutely love them I
think
they're very cool very flattering and
great for winter as well because he's a
black they'll be really nice low winter
Sun sunglasses and last but not least a
pair that I wore a lot in New York I
found these again really great for that
low winter Sun and they are this almost
leopard print design from Kate Spade eye
where they have the little Spade emblem
there which most of these sunglasses do
I just love that kind of very subtle
design detail these once again big
statement sunglasses but I absolutely
love that I think they're really cool
really flattering really statement and
as I mentioned so many types of
sunglasses I love they don't have that
little nodule here so when you wear them
on your head like so it doesn't pull all
of your hair out too when you try and
pull them off your head if you've got
your hair up in particular so really
really love those and will definitely be
wearing these a lot as my winter
sunglasses so that's everything that I
picked up from Kate Spade on our recent
trip to New York I really hope you guys
enjoyed looking through all these pieces
with me I feel very lucky to have had
the opportunity to experience New York
with a brand that I adore so much and
they were so generous with what they
gave to us as well as I hope that you
