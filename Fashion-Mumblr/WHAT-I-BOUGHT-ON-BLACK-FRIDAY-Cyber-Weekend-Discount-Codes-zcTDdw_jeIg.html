joining me for today's video I hope you
are not tired of Black Friday and Cyber
weekend because I have one more haul for
you these are the pieces that I
personally bought on Black Friday in
case you missed it I did actually
publish a video on Friday itself and
that was a haul of pieces that I picked
up throughout the week and also I was
sharing with you the pieces that I
already had in my wardrobe that went
down in the sales so check that video
out if you haven't already there's loads
of very classic pieces that I wear so so
so much my Karen Millen boots my
Aspinall handbags I showed you which of
my most worn pieces have gone down in
the sales so check that video out if you
haven't already today's video it's going
to be the pieces that I bought on Black
Friday so a little mini haul I didn't go
too crazy I'm mostly actually bought
electrical pieces China I bought a new
Dyson and you kettle a new toaster and
you duvet it's a new bed linen and on
that note I do have a blog post which I
updated this morning and it has all of
the discount codes you guys will need
including fashion and beauty but also
tech and home as well so if there are
some pieces that you guys still want to
invest in then check out that blog post
and it took me quite a long time to put
it together so I really hope you find it
useful that will be linked also down in
description box so without further ado
let's go through the pieces that I
bought on Black Friday the jumper that
I'm wearing is the first piece I picked
this up in the ACE or sale so a sauce
currently are still at 20% of the entire
website which is amazing I use it as an
opportunity to stock up on some new
winter knitwear pieces this is from a
brand that I hadn't tried before I think
it's called one on I believe that's
right and I wanted to try a few of their
pieces before but the price point is a
little bit higher than what I was happy
to pay so that 20% off just made all the
difference this I'm really really
pleased with such a cozy slouchy knit I
like this very big chunky knit detail on
the sleeves is the perfect piece for
like relaxing at home also for wearing
perhaps over a dress to add that snuggle
factor so yeah really really pleased
with this first one and by the way
everything that I mentioned will of
course be linked down in the description
box if you want to shop anything that
I'm featuring in today's video the next
thing that I picked up is from River
Island but I also added this to my a
sauce basket and it is a very very
chunky jumper dress now you guys know
how much I love jumper dresses and
I was surprised that I haven't seen this
one before actually I just love things
like this it's the perfect neutral color
I love this ginormous feral Trung Kien
it definitely one I can fit a thermal on
underneath and then you've also got this
really big snuggly neckline this I'm so
excited to wear with my over knee boots
with a juillet perhaps or with a coat
over the top a really great layering
piece and once again a bargain with a 20
percent off on ASOS this next piece is
another one from the one on brand and it
is a chunky cardigan with a pom-pom
detail on a sleeve this looked amazing
on the model and I thought what a lovely
layering piece to add to my collection
for the autumn winter months in
particular I thought this would be a
really nice piece when you're just
lounging at home and you just want
something a little bit snuggly on
perhaps not a full-on dressing-gown so
you want to be a bit smarter I thought
it'd be great for that and also for
flights or traveling or long journeys I
thought it'd just be super super snuggly
and a cozy piece and finally from ASOS
another piece of knitwear from the same
brand I did go a little bit crazy and
this one is probably my favorite so this
once again is a fairly plain chunky knit
but as you can tell I just love this
style jumper during the colder months
but this has a super snuggly really big
roll neck and then I thought the sleeves
had a really nice design as well you've
got that big almost pull up like chunky
ferrule detail going down the sleeves
you've got these little tassels I
thought this would be an amazing piece
for perhaps like a pray ski if you're
going to skiing for pairing with your
favorite pair of jeans it could just
look very very stylish in my opinion
this is the kind of jumper that looks
very very premium you can almost imagine
this being like a Fendi or even a Chloe
jumper so I'm thinking I'm going to wear
this with my favorite pair of jeans over
knee boots and then perhaps a faux fur
she lay over the top so you'll
definitely be seeing restyling this up
quite a lot in the coming months and
again very happy to have got this with a
20% discount all right so this I am very
very excited about I got this from River
Island they had 20% off when you spent
over 75 pounds that deal is still going
on today and it is a Christmas jumper
with Dickens on it I can't believe that
this looks identical to my handsome
little chap he's got his party hat on
he's got his Christmas jumper on and
other than the fact that it has a
sausage dog on it which just makes it
absolutely amazing
I really like the style of this
Christmas jumper I love its high-necked
I love the burgundy color it's just
absolutely amazing I feel like I need to
also get one of these charlie while it's
still in the Black Friday sale um
but yeah as soon as I saw this on Black
Friday I knew it had to be mine also
making the most out of the discount on
river island I picked up two tops which
I feel are going to be major core pieces
in my winter wardrobe these tops I think
are just such a beautiful design so
they're fairly plain turtleneck tops but
they have this beautiful voluminous
sleeve detail it's almost like a
Victorian style sleeve and then the bit
that I love the most is the hem detail
so you have got a fluted ruffle sleeve
on the hem I actually wore this white
one a little bit earlier so I'll insert
a clip of me wearing it so you can see
how it looks like on and because I
thought the white one looked so fabulous
when I saw it in the recommended section
that it also came in black I thought I
would try it as well I think this would
be particularly good for a work wardrobe
it's a really nice way of having
something a little bit more stylish than
a very plain polo neck for work or
perhaps for school if you're allowed to
wear your own thing then this would be a
really nice top for that so yes very
very pleased with my to me tops from
River Island and then last but not least
as I said I didn't go too crazy on
actual Black Friday because I had made a
few purchases earlier in the week my
last few pieces are more giftee pieces
and again I did talk about a few other
gifts that I bought in Friday's haul so
yeah definitely check out that one but I
wanted to show you these last few pieces
so I did buy a new goose down duvet and
mattress protector from the white
company and I also picked up this
curtain of fairy lights I've wanted this
kind of thing for so long whether I use
it over the fireplace or maybe even over
this mirror here I'm not too sure but I
thought the white company always have
the most beautiful Christmas decorations
and Christmas lights I do think of the
white company as a luxury store so to
save 20% was a really good discount I
save quite a lot of money on my white
company halt so this was one of the more
exciting pieces that I did pick up from
the white company and then I'm not going
to show you too much of what I brought
from anthropology because a lot of the
pieces are gifts and I don't want to
spoil any surprises but anthropology it
had up to I believe it was 50% of so
many pieces in there
and I did get a few lovely bits in the
sale this one is the CEO of my own life
planner I love things like this and I
feel like they make great stocking
fillers really great gifts that people
will genuinely use I think that
anthropology as a whole is a great place
to look for stocking fillers and
Christmas presents the buyers just seem
to choose the perfect selection of
products and there's just so much
inspiration there so I highly recommend
checking out the Anthropology website so
I picked up that and also this pair of
gloves these are cashmere gloves and on
the tips of the sow the index finger the
tips of this finger they have what I
think they called a tech covering so
that means you can use your phone with
these gloves on as well they also have
little pearls along the top section
which is just a really nice design
detail so once again a really lovely
gift and I did save myself almost 10
pounds thanks to the 20% off on
anthropology over the cyber weekend so
those are the pieces that I picked up on
Black Friday I hope you enjoyed looking
through all of these pieces with me as I
mentioned if you do have some shopping
left to do or you want to save yourself
a little bit more money during the cyber
weekend and then check out the blog post
for all of the retailers that I think
that you guys will be wanting to shop

mentioned in today's video let me know
