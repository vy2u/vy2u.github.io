at the Lanesboro this evening charlie is
actually here for a dinner with Yvonne
she and they very kindly given him a
room for the night so I'm gonna crash
here as well

normally it's beauty brand inviting me
for an overnight stay and Charlie comes
with my plus-one so it is very nice to
have the use of this room and be his
plus-one for change times are changing
so yeah so you know I've had a fabulous
afternoon together it was just such a
girly way to spend the afternoon we had
theses on Neville show at home house
which was divine

romantic feminine oh my gosh very like
whimsical dreamy met Suzanne she was so
lovely and she spoke us through some of
her favorite designs and we got to see
them all up close look at the beautiful
materials so that was magical and then
we went to the Ritz we had first of all
we had a makeup top-up with Bobbi Brown
so they did the makeup for the Jenny
Packham show we had a little bit of a
Bridal I would say makeunder actually so
he had a really lovely light weight base
starting off is like a glowy bomb which
just pepped up the complexion and then
the girls were showing me some kind of
Bridal makeup hacks like creating a
really natural flushed cheek with a
cream blush with some moisturiser mixed
in love that then after I makeover we
went for afternoon tea and just and
while we were enjoying the tea we had
the Jenny Packham show which was very
different this is on Neville so it's
really nice to see two different shows I
would say the Jenny Packham dresses are
a lot more kind of their very statement
in that they've got lots of
embellishment lots of intricate sequins
and details lots of sparkles there are a
couple of like periwinkle blue dress as
well which was amazing the final look
was like a leather jacket and it almost
had it almost looked as though it been
like hand-painted so some very cool
designs as you will have just seen so

Sandin
good morning darlings it is now at
Thursday
I must apologize that this vlog has been
a little bit here there in everywhere
with little snippets from basically
every morning and then I get tired and
forget to vlog in the afternoon so I'm
really sorry this has been a bit of a
mess of a weekly vlog but I haven't
feeling it too well as you might be able
to guess from my voice and I just think
I've picked up a bit of a cold so I'm
trying not to overdo it
today I have just got out the shower
that had the most pampering shower
sometimes when I'm not feeling well I
just kind of have a bit of a pampering
morning and I wanted to give a huge
shout out to this this is the lime basil
and Mandarin German in London
exfoliating shower gel because I smell
so good right now it was really lovely
and just a very very pampering treat so
if you love indulgent showers highly
recommend that and so the last clip you
will have seen is an outfit style clip
that I shot yesterday I did a quick top
changeover from what I was wearing in
the morning to what I was wearing in the
afternoon and and that whole outfit was
Karen Millen today let me show you the
state of this room because I've been a
little bit tired I've just kind of
chucked stuff in this room and then shut
the door and forget it forgot about it
but this morning I'm going to tackle it
look at this oh my goodness I mean
there's like piles of laundry there's
blogger mail and there's goodie bags
from events that I've been to so without
further ado I'm just gonna attack this
room and get it tidy again cuz I can't
sit down and work on my laptop if the
house is messy so first thing I need to
do today is just blitz this
another night by the window um as close
as every time but some problems with me
why you can play it on it
Thank You Heather right I won't take it
anymore
okay excuse my frizzy hair I have just
let it dry naturally and this is what
happens and the room is now pretty much
tidy aside from what's on here which is
pretty much my blogger mail try not to
flash you so I thought I would show you
a few of the highlights first of all
there's this lovely new launch from
Kiehl's
and it is I think this is an essence
part of your skincare routine you
clearly corrective brightening and
soothing treatment water so you can
apply this after cleansing the skin
maybe in place of a toner it's supposed
to improve improve skin's luminosity and
visibly improve the clarity and I think
this has got anti-pollution filters in
there as well so that is gonna go
straight into my bathroom I'll let you
know how I get along with that then I
have this rather fun delivery from
origins its origins and Madeline Shores
collaboration they've sent this coconut
and a kit to drill into it to it so that
I can enjoy the coconut water this is to
celebrate the launch of a new face mask
which Charlie has already pinched from
my blogger mail pile
it's a hydrating coconut face mask
called glow Konitz
inspired by Madeline's love of coconuts
I'm sure this will be absolutely
fabulous and smell divine
I have this really cute little Easter
delivery from EOS it's like an egg box
and then inside are a selection of EOS
lip balms but how adorable does that
look so so cute we've got we've got like
a raspberry ripple one Oh actually it's
warm lip balm and loads of eggs okay
that's really really cute nobody got
time for dry lips so we've got loads of
little personalized eggs and then a
little lip balm that is so so cute I'm
actually gonna put this in a little
goodie bag to send to my cousin I think
she would really really like that so if
you're watching Eloise and I may expect
a nice little delivery from Auntie juicy
soon then I have this lovely it looks
like a glittery pencil case from Sally
Hansen this will be very lawful for
traveling and inside we have got care
around the clock a little notebook
that's personalized it says Josie's
dreams this is like little dream dream
journal then we have a gel rehab
overnight renewal mask to help repair
nails to pregel condition that is
amazing as you probably know I have gel
nails pretty much all the time and
sometimes you have to take a break from
getting your nails done because it's not
very good for your nails it really dries
them out so this is something that you
can put on between your gels that is
such a good idea it says advance non
sticky nail mask infused with vitamins
and overnight renewal complex to
reinforce damaged nails in between
traditional gel manicures oh my goodness
I need this in my life very excited to
try that
Thank You Sally Hansen I have also got
this lovely little makeup bag which is
from the Elizabeth Arden and Lydia
millon collaboration so when you knit by
three Elizabeth Arden products from
boots you get this beautiful little
makeup bag it's in my favorite blush
pink shade and I think it's yeah I think
it's any three products you can buy and
you get this free of charge with lots of
lovely little goodies inside so many of
my favorites
there's a mini of the superstar serum
which is just a brilliant product to put
on your skin pre makeup after cleansing
we've got some mini ice serum ceramide
capsules and my all-time favorite to the
evening ceramide capsules these are just
the most fabulous thing let's pop in
your travel bag I love these little
tubes as well very very handy for
weekend breaks a very big anti-aging
cleanser from the provides range also a
little mini of the lipsticks all in this
gorgeous case of the very beautiful who
are the beautiful mirror in the lid very
very handy size so a beautiful
collaboration I look forward to using
that I've also received this bag this is
from a website that I've told you guys
about several times called artisan
anything obviously very much inspired
behind the Chloe bag it's an absolutely
beautiful design I always think that
this website the bags are such good
quality this will be a gorgeous piece
for my spring wardrobe I really love the
design of the Chloe Niall bags so I'll
get a lot of wear out of this one it's
quite big it's bigger than my gold so I
just have to change my camera battery
and yeah I was just saying how fabulous
the quality of these bags are if this
had the word Chloe printed here I
literally would not be able to tell the
difference between this and the Chloe
nail bag of this as a fraction of the
price
huge fan of this website I will leave
this linked down
I've also had a delivery from YSL I have
a selection of a new lip products here I
think these are called the Rouge will
looked shine lip glosses and let's have
a little look this is the shade own
overlooked a liquid color bottom so
maybe this is gonna be a cross between
lip gloss and eye balm which would be
amazing they look very much like a gloss
with the way that they are applied in
fact let's just give this a go I'm gonna
find a more neutral shade this is shade
number one looks like a neutral colored
lip balm oh my god they smell so good
these literally smell like sweet smells
app seek or giuse feels very like
conditioning on my lips I'm not sure how
this would compare to a normal lip balm
but I'm gonna wear this for the next few
hours and I can comment back I also have
a delivery from benefit
this says Gold Rush and then inside we
have got this gorgeous box and a new
addition to the benefit blush family
which also comes in a mini so Gold Rush
is the new benefit blusher hopefully
it's a little bit pearlescent I'm
guessing it's going to be by the name oh
my goodness that is absolutely stunning
it almost looks like a cross between a
blush and a highlight and I really like
to combine the two I don't really like
to go too overboard with a highlight but
I love to have a bit of sheen on my
cheeks so I think that's gonna be
amazing I'm gonna give that a try when I
do my makeup today I'm very happy that
it comes in a mini as well great for
traveling thank you very much benefit I
have this very crazy looking bum back
here and this was sent to me from a
brand called C y/o which is available at
Boots and inside is some very very
colorful makeup we've got a really
bright fuchsia lipstick and equally
bright I think this is a lipstick and
lip liner powder blush all in this like
super vibrant fuchsia color lip gloss
another lipstick literally everything is
this crazy bright color there's a
slightly more neutral blush color so if
you are into your very bright cosmetics
and this is available at Boots I also
have to show you these gorgeous pieces
that I got a meeting a couple of days
ago I met a company called the wedding
shop and they are basically a wedding
gift list come
so an amazing website where you can
choose whether you want a gift or cash
or something towards your honeymoon a
really really lovely service and they've
given charlie night a little bundle of
gifts first of which is this beautiful
scarlet Elizabeth's garlic handle and
it's a lavender scented ones that's
going to be a really nice one for
bedroom a beautiful leather-bound
notebook this has moments of genius this
will be a nice handbag notebook and then
it says wedding shop on the back and
this I'm so excited to use this is from
a brand called LSA China I have quite a
lot of their home web pieces in the
house and it's just beautiful pearlized
bars which is such a good idea for an
engagement gift or a wedding gift
honestly a lot of the time wedding gifts
are for at the couple's new house
together so lovely things like this for
the home that make for gorgeous gifts
this is absolutely beautiful it looks
like a bubble so it's not too obviously
paralysed which just means it'll look
really really perfect in our lounge and
then if we get any stems of roses or we
could even collect some fresh flowers
from know our god we don't have many
fresh perhaps in our garden I love you
house gardens just like little bouquets
of snowdrops or daffodils at this time
of year would look so so lovely in this
a very thoughtful gift so thank you to
the wedding shop and then lastly you
might have spotted this bag in the
background really really beautiful bag
it's actually a guest handbag this is
for me to use tonight because we are
going to a party with Amazon fashion
this is available on Amazon they have
such an amazing selection of fashion
pieces brands like guest Michael Kors
Tommy Hilfiger Coast so many brands that
I absolutely love and yeah they very
kindly sent me this to wear tonight so
you'll see this in amongst my outfit
later on this evening I'm gonna crack on
with some work now it's about 11 o'clock
and I'm yet to do anything terribly
productive aside from tidying this room
which now looks gorgeous so I will see
you a little bit later on okay it's a
couple of hours later
now I've just filmed this makeup look
this is my everyday makeup look that
I've just been reaching for and doing
pretty much every single day lately
however I'm not actually sure if I'm
gonna publish it because I as you can
tell or here I feel very bummed up
and I don't know I just felt like I was
really lacking in energy and it just
wasn't very flattering so I'm not sure
if I'm gonna publish it I really don't
know how these girls produce so many
amazing makeup videos I just think they
are so hard to film like getting the
lighting right and making yourself look
good at all times it's just really
really hard so not sure I'm going to do
it and yeah I'm not sure if I'm gonna
publish it or not so if you don't see a
spring everyday makeup routine as part
of the fashion of the spring edit then
that's why because I filmed it when I
was feeling very poorly I've actually
also just messaged the Amazon girls to
say that suddenly I'm not gonna be able
to make it their event this afternoon
because I feel like I'm so fluey I just
don't want to pass it on to anybody and
I wouldn't really be much fun an event
like this I think I'm just gonna get in
my pajamas and work from the sofa from
the rest of the afternoon or maybe stay
as I am because let's be honest I'm
already in my comfy clothes this is the
jumper that they sent me to wear tonight
it's Tommy Hilfiger jumper absolutely
gorgeous and I was gonna wear it along
with the gasbag which I showed you
earlier so yeah I hopefully will find
another occasion to wear them they're
such lovely pieces and always feel so
bad for letting people down but I think
I just need to have some time to recover
so I'm gonna head downstairs now and
make myself another lemon sip and I
hopefully get a little bit of work done
good morning it is Friday it is the
wettest most miserable day you have ever
seen let me show you that is all I see
right now gray skies looks blue but I
promise you it's gray and I still have a
little bit of a cold so I've actually
been around for jamás most of the day I
only just got dressed I am dressed
because I'm heading into town I have got
two elements facial this afternoon and
I'm going to go into a couple of shops
I've got some Zara things to return that
I do a very quick outfit of the day this
is my like zero effort outfit so I just
want to be cozy so I've got my trusty
Marks &amp;amp; Spencer chunky knits then my
Reece coats my Topshop scarf and then
this is the guest bag that was kindly
sent to me from the guys at Amazon
fashions they do sell guess bag
on Amazon I'll leave it link down below
and then I've got my jeans and trainers
this is literally the most casual you'll
ever see me but worth it for the weather
so that's guys this is officially the
most depressing if there's anything
worth leaving the house for is an LMS
facial I think this is to launch a new
night product but I will let you know
all about it and I finish the treatments
just picks out a gel juice power shake
and now it's time to relax in my robe in
the penthouse of the house of elements
I've just been introduced to the new
product this is the pro-collagen
overnight matrix explain all about that
later I've also just had my skin
analyzed we're going to do some
treatments based around hydration a
little bit of blemish treatment and lots
of relaxation this is how beautiful the
penthouse looks it's time to relax oh my
goodness I do not think I've ever felt
so relaxed after treatment I dunno so I
fell asleep
many many times during that facial it
was so relaxing pretty sure I was
snoring as well there were loads of
different parts to it and there was a
cleansing part light treatment loads of
massage absolute bliss and finishing
with the overnight matrix my skin looks
and feels very clear and fresh now I'm
gonna get dressed downstairs to get a
glass of water got back home from our
owners burger and not only how Dexter
and Dickens been chewing daddy's
trainers and the Amazon Alexa box and
they've been taking all the clothes off
the dryer mummy and daddys shoes we've
got clothes what have you to save
yourself
you naughty boy we've got clothes over
here and then as you can see they have
shredded a bag of popcorn oh you naughty
boys where did you even find this where
did you even find it I have never known
a naughty a puppy in my entire life
I bet it was all you wasn't it it was
all you oh you bad boys Oh naughty boy
naughty
okay so up in the bedroom now and these
are a couple of pieces that I was very
very kindly given at LMS excuse my old
room flu cups your tablets very kindly
given by the girls LMS after my amazing
facial this is a product that's
launching it's a new addition to the pro
cotton range which you guys know I am a
huge huge huge huge huge fan of and it's
there overnight matrix so it's basically
a night mask or night cream you can use
it every single night and she was
explaining that it has something in it
called drone peptide technology and what
that means is that the active
ingredients in this like a drone kind of
homed in on that the areas of your skin
that need it so its anti-aging is good
for stressed skin it's good for
targeting wrinkles and fine lines
Charlie has just handed me these another
thing from the pro-collagen range that
we absolutely love so I'm going to apply
a little bit more of this I do already
have some on my skin from after the
facial but we have been too honest verga
so maybe I'll just do a quick micellar
water and apply some of that and then
this is their soothing a candle this is
what I use most evenings the LMS Pro
collagen marine oil absolutely love that
and the lady of the facial said that I
could apply this first and then my
matrix so I will keep you guys up data
is how I get along with discs it is a
new launch and I'm not going to show you
my face because I look really scary but
I'm gonna say good night thank you for
watching and I'm going to end the vlog
here because it has been a long one so
yeah I'm over there just so it's not
totally faceless yeah I've got oils all
over my hair so I do look a little bit
scary but thank you for watching and I
will see you in the next one
