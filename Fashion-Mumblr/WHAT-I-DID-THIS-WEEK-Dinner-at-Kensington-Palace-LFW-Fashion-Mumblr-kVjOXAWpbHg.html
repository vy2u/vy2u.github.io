weekly vlog starting on the Thursday for
a change because it is going to be a
fashion week starting this weekend and
you don't really miss much before the
beginning of this week so I thought I
would start it today because yeah fun
things are happening today don't know
why I decided to start the vlog off by
talking to you in the mirror but yeah
this week so yesterday was Valentine's
Day we had a really really lovely
Valentine's Day Charlie had booked just
tickets to go and see the Lion King
which is my favorite musical ever I'm
not like a major major musical person
but I'm a major Lion King person I was
bursting into tears as soon as Rafiki
the lady that plays Rafiki does then I
was in tears at that point and so if I
just heard you a drum so I'm not a
naturally gifted singer so yeah that was
amazing and we went to Cafe Monaco
before that for a pre theater dinner and
it was just the best days so yes that
was wonderful
earlier in the week on Monday I went for
dinner with a sauce which was really
good fun I've never met a sauce team
before so it's lovely to get to know
them and there's been lots of working
from home this week also my little Dicky
chicky had his operation he had his
little co horny taken out he only had
one TMI but the other ball was in his
groin so it's quite a big operation but
he's fine he's recovering really well so
yeah that's pretty much you guys up to
speed with my week so far as I said
Thursday today I'm off for a germ alone
event now and then I've got a couple of
meetings I'm doing some really fun
things with Nespresso as well this
weekend for the BAFTAs so I will take
you along for all of that and show you
what I'm wearing so I'm going to start
off with what I'm wearing today so let
me show you that this is pretty much
just my uniform at the moment so we have
my tory burch roll neck underneath white
roll neck super versatile amazing item
Rhys suede skirt because you guys know
how much I love this and it's fabulous
these boots I have actually been
switching up my over knee boots for
these they are from El cabinets and the
color of them I'm just obsessed with I
needed an extra layer of warmth so I've
got my lovely Topshop scarf just the
that pink color and then my gray over
the top coat which is probably my
longest coat so great for if you want a
little bit of extra warmth this is from
Karen Millen and they say at the moment
and then as you may guess I have my
beautiful beautiful Mallory handbag
which comes with me everywhere I were
basically surgically attached and I'm
going to show you my jewelry as well
because I know a lot if you love to see
the jewelry that I'm wearing flip around
with the earrings these are my Monica
Van der diamond they're from the Fiji
collection and I just love them so much
I don't take them out I sleep in them I
shower in them and I just think they
make every outfit looks so lovely and
then on my hand I've got two more Monica
villager rings these are both siren
rings perfect stacking I really want to
get something else to pop on this finger
obviously I have my engagement ring back
hopefully very soon and then I've got
three more Monica villager bracelets
here the top one that you can see the
bubbly one is from the button is a
button design from the Fuji collection
and then we've got a Fuji friendship
bracelet and a Fiji diamond bracelet
just absolutely love choosing my little
combination every morning you can't see
it too well but I do have this lovely
little heart-shaped umaña covenant
necklace and then this one is actually
part of necklace that Charlie got me for
our first anniversary and it's you can
alternate the length of it so it's got
like a bauble at the back so I can pull
it down make it shorter so super
versatile and then on my next wrist just
a couple more stacking bracelets my
signature bracelet which I wear all the
time and then another button diamond one
from the Fiji collection so yes as you
can tell very much into the layering at
the moment so that is my outfit of the
day time to go to the germ alone I think
it's called the English garden breakfast
but we'll soon find out
so it come to the German townhouse and
it has been that turned into an English
field as you can see I'm in a room for
the weeks and they are launching a new
collection of fragrances it's a limited
edition and I'm fragrances for the
spring and they're all inspired by
different grain types have got Oh
finally I will show you all of them
later on but just to take a moment to
appreciate how fabulous the Town Council
looks so I just got back home from my
morning of meetings and I just made
myself some pasta and then you know when
you have something savory and you just
crave even the tiniest little sweet
thing you just crave it after a savory
meal so I came upstairs so excited to
have one of my little rosey gummies you
know there's lonely little gummies of
the made of rose a wine so excited to
have one and they are gone there was a
whole jar of them and I just text
Charlie whereas he put them and he's
eaten the whole lot of them so I thought
I would just sit down and show you the
goodies from this morning very quickly I
instantly got home and took my outfit
off and put on this dressing-gown it's a
really cute little personalized one who
sent to me from the M&amp;amp;S beauty team I
love it so we have this lovely goodie
bag from Jo Malone at the fabulous event
this morning to celebrate their limited
edition range of fragrances so the
townhouse as you saw this morning was
taken over with props looked like a
wonderful English field and these are
the limit edition fragrances I have got
green wheat and meadowsweet and Primrose
and rye so the bottles are a little bit
different to what you might remember
German and bottles looking like and
that's because he's a limited edition
every year they bring out new
limited-edition fragrances I think
Primrose and rye is my favorite it's
just so almost like powdery feminine
it's got a little bit of floral to it
but not like a super sweet floral deke
and dexia charging around downstairs
that honestly it could be a new favorite
so I'm going to pop that straight into
my collection and then we have green
wheat and meadowsweet I think this is
one that reminds me a little bit of lime
besan mandarin yes which is good timing
because this is
oh no Basler neroli that reminds me of
this is the current situation with my
Buffalo neroli
literally got maybe one use left in this
that's the perfect timing
and then I went to catch up for the
Astrodome you girls at their flagship
store at some Christopher's place and I
have a couple of new jewelry pieces to
show you so this one is a hexagonal ear
cuff if you can see the beautiful kind
of diamond and rose gold design this I
thought would be really perfect for me
because I actually like to be quite
outgoing with what I wear in my ears but
I'm not very cool and not very like edgy
or street style but I just really like
to have something a little bit unusual
in my ear so this don't know if my
camera will decide to focus on this but
it's like a hook so this will hook
through my ear and then I'll wear it by
pulling it up the ear like so and I
think they'll just be a really lovely
statement ear piece and then the other
earring in the box is a single hexagon
which can go in the other ear so very
much looking forward to standing that up
when you see me tomorrow I'll probably
have that in my ear and then similar
kind of vibe this one is a little bit
more plain it's just a simple row of the
gemstones and then in this final box and
this is from their new collections their
latest collection is a little bit more
simple very wearable it's called their
basics collection this is as you can see
a rose gold pendant
once again layer this up with other
necklaces that I'm wearing I've got this
Monika finna dependent on now and these
would look really really beautiful
together I love it it's got little dots
on the chain as well really really
lovely for layering I will show you this
with a proper outfit tomorrow as you can
get a better idea of it but that is
honestly just so so beautiful Astra Mia
pieces equality is gorgeous the price
points are amazing so I'm a big fan as
you guys know I also have a little bit
of blogger mail which I'll just whisk
through really quickly with you firstly
a couple of bits from slip and I've
tried to slip my masks before an app so
you love them pure silk so very delicate
on the skin oh my goodness that is
absolutely adorable I think this is my
favorite one yet
currently my favorite one is there one
which is just blush pink but oh my
goodness this is amazing I find I sleeps
so much better with eye mass that's
another icon holiday airplane
they're an absolute must they also have
a pure silk pillowcase oh my goodness
this is absolutely brilliant silk
pillowcases are better for your skin
better for your hair cuz they don't
cause so much friction they help keep
your skin's moisture and expensive face
and hair products where they belong on
your face and hair they reduce friction
which can reduce stretching and tugging
on delicate skin and her friend Lee silk
can help preserve preserve your blowout
as well so lots and lots of benefits to
using a slope slope silk pillowcase are
we popping that on and trying that out
tonight oh yes this is just what the
doctor ordered you know I said I was
craving something sweet this is a little
delivery from a brand called power of
love or POW and they are some energy
balls I was meant to go and pick these
up yesterday for Valentine's Day but I
just totally ran out of time so they are
individually packaged little energy
balls this one says it contains fig oats
on the butter dates coke coconut oil
Marco cacao goji berry vanilla extract
and raspberry sounds amazing
let's give this a try as you guys
probably know I love making my own
energy balls I find them such perfect
things to snack on but they always
somehow taste better when someone else
makes them so I always say that the
ingredients in these kinds of energy
balls are so good for that mid-afternoon
slump like right now it's 3 o'clock and
I just need a bit of an energy boost
I've made myself a coffee having one of
those balls as well and I'll be ready to
work right into the early evening with
that so perfect alternative to things
like crisps or donuts for Rosie jelly
sweets for example I had an amazing
delivery from Juicy Couture as well I
absolutely loved you sketch your
fragrances and they're really
surprisingly amazing like when I'm
wearing them people always ask what I'm
wearing and they're shocked when I say
they're Juicy Couture I think people
think they're gonna be quite sickly and
sweet but actually they're just so so
wearable this is a new one viva la juicy
soiree and they also popped in this
adorable little matching Prosecco which
I'm very excited to have oh my goodness
it's almost got like a masquerade kind
of Mardi Gras style to it it's like a
graffiti paint splatter all over it and
then you've got the iconic bow I feel
like that's a very recognizable scent
you know what it might kill me for
saying this but it smells like a far
more grown
version of the Britney Spears fragrance
witches in that blue bottle with the
pink oh what was it called I want to say
like fantasy but I wore that so much in
my teens and this just smells like a
mature version of that
so naturally I absolutely love it
another amazing one from Juicy Couture
okay I was not expecting this these are
new launches from YSL oh my goodness
they look like as bright as acrylic
paints that is crazy
toosha cloud blur primer surely they're
not this color unless they're color
correcting Oh
oh my god it literally is bright orange
product that is insane these must be
color correcting surely actually to be
fair that has really brightened up the
skin I'm so excited to give these a try
I wonder what that's going to do to my
complexion and this absolute bonkers and
then we have to cycle and then we have
two slightly more wearable looking
products this is the - Shekhar
all-in-one glow foundation and they've
popped in two different shades Bea
Arthur T and B are twenty I've heard
really good things about this from
fellow beauty bloggers so I'm gonna give
that a try tomorrow
Clinique sent this over with a little
note about how you shouldn't have to
share your serums one for him one for
her this is the Moisture Surge serum for
me and the and the maximum hydrator for
Charlie Ivy frame soon to know if these
products are actually any different
aside from the color probably not to
difference but it's nice to have a
his-and-hers option hope you'll stop
Charlie from stealing my hydrating serum
and then the rest of the things are
fashion pieces and I think I'm gonna
film a what's new in my wardrobe video
so I will save those for that I think
I'm gonna head downstairs and do some
work now nothing very exciting will
happen for the rest of the day so I
think I'll catch up with you guys
tomorrow so yeah I'll see you then good
morning it is now Friday and today I am
just picking up the camera at around 3
o'clock because this morning as you
might be our two guests from the havoc
behind me
this morning has been a filming day I
had a personal training session with
Adam first thing and I've spent the past
four hours filming videos because it's
Fashion Week so aside from today I'm not
gonna have any
time to film I thought they were just
bulk film that's the face full of makeup
but I haven't filmed my trial clips for
the fashion videos yet so annoyingly I'm
gonna have to leave the room in this
state until tomorrow morning because I
have got a nail appointment now /
meeting killing two birds with one stone
having a meeting with bareMinerals and
also we're going to get the pedi
together so heading to my favorite
London grace to do that and then this
afternoon after that I have got a la
Mare facial at Harrods which I'm very
excited for I might nip into some shops
on Brompton Road as well cuz they have
some really nice shops around there as
well so that is a plan for the rest of
the day so yeah let's go for a pedi
excuse the horrific mess behind me but
just a very quick outfit of the day so
far for today obviously I'm gonna get
changed before I go out but this is what
I've been wearing on my days working
from home this is a very comfy casual
knit from Dorothy Perkins I just love
the color
I think it looks really nice with my
stacked necklaces as well really
comfortable and then these are I'm sorry
so much mess these are some kind of
clock knitted trousers from River Island
they've got almost like a plaited bread
detail running through them high-waisted
so super comfortable I just think this
is really cute and cozy working from
home outfit I think it's quite quite a
chic outfit for working from home I
definitely have run to the shops in this
and thought it looked quite cool and
then as always my emu slippers and then
when I'm filming what I normally do is
just switch my tops so for example what
was I wearing just stuck on a different
blouse because you can only see the top
half when I'm filming so usually I'm
wearing like tracky bottoms or workout
trousers or something cute and cozy like
this when I'm filming I'm actually going
to go out wearing this outfit because
I've got such chilled things to do this
afternoon so I've just popped on it
these gorgeous little flat shoes these
are from Jones boot maker and you would
not believe how much I have worn these
they're so practical I find that they
just go with so many things whether they
are just for dashing out the house like
I'm doing now or wearing with something
slightly smarter perhaps
a tweed skirt like this obviously not
with the clots poking out the bottom but
they're just super super versatile and
credibly comfortable little flats I'm
definitely going to be popping these in
my handbag for Fashion Week outfits as
well because if I want to swap out my
high-heeled shoes something a bit more
comfortable then they are absolutely
perfect for that great for getting at my
pedicure as well and they are this
lovely kind of blush almost grey suede
pink color and I just think that
absolutely beautiful so yeah this is my
outfit for heading out for my pedi so
I've just had my pedi at London Grace
and discovered all the new launches
coming very soon from bareMinerals which
includes more products from the bare Pro
range which is as you probably know my
favourite foundation as concealers and
some more shades of the powder so I will
show you this properly at a later date
but I'm already a big fan now just
heading it down abouts on the street I
have got some my lover facial which I'm
very much looking forward to I have a
lot of makeup on stay from filming so
looking forward to a deep good morning
it is now Saturday and Charlie and I and
the little boys are not way to the Savoy
so this evening we are heading to the
bathtub nominees party as guests of
Nespresso and it's gonna be at
Kensington Palace we've got all of our
cloud ranks with us very much looking
forward to that
I think we're having a coffee inspired
four-course dinner after the kind of a
shoot yeah after the Menomonee party so
really looking forward to that got some
pampering first getting makeup done by
Lancome hair by cool Edmonds so it's
gonna be a really lovely afternoon it's
a beautiful day in London blue skies
I'm falling don't know what it is where
you go alrighty so it's an hour or so
later and we are almost ready to head
out as you just saw in those little time
lapses I just had my makeup done that by
the lovely hat found in the Lancome
suite he's done a very dramatic brown
smokey eye look and then I asked him for
my signature Brown pink lip and he's
done a wonderful job I'm not used to
seeing myself with this much eye makeup
so it's kind of dramatic look for me and
then I went to DePaul Edmond sweet and
Paul Edmondson Lancome are both partners
of the baptists as is Nespresso and the
lovely Althea curled my hair he left it
in this really fabulous big voluminous
bouncy blow-dry effect but when I'm
eating or when I'm just out and about I
don't like having my hair too much in my
face so I've just pinned it back a
little bit and it feels a little bit
more me so this is my interpretation and
then I'm wearing the dress which you may
remember I wore to the Dior Christmas
dinner I thought this would be the
perfect dress but tonight the dress code
is cocktail so yes this is what I've
gone for and then of my Valentino shoes
and I'm also gonna be taking my Chloe
handbag my King has made himself quite
comfortable we love it here at the Savoy
it's like our second home all right
darling what are you wearing is it
dinner jacket I think you could call it
more of a smoking jacket gorgeous you
can wear it with a roll you can wherever
the show where's that from
that's hardly Amy's we had that for
quite a while really
but it's pretty tired yeah I'm actually
owned many times I won't use your
Mustang really very nice and my two boys
are gonna be chillin here don't order
too much room service darling - monkey
monkeys
so it's Sunday morning now I didn't
actually take my vlogging camera out
with me last night because my hand like
a little bit too small but it was a
really really lovely evening thank you
so much to Nespresso taking us along the
whole connection is the Nespresso they
have a lot of connections with film that
they work with the Cannes Film Festival
as well and they really like to support
creativity and upcoming talent so they
were sponsoring at the nominees party
last night which is what we attended
yeah they're one of the main partners of
the BAFTAs themselves and so when we
arrived we had a coffee coffee purl so
like a coffee ravioli as like a canopy
which is really cool it's like a bubble
and then I had a shot of espresso inside
that was really nice and then we had our
full course coffee inspired dinner in a
private dining room in Kensington Palace
quite surreal I think I did get a couple
of clips of that but it was delicious we
had to feel at stake with a Miss
espresso salt and then that the dessert
was a little cinnamon and some cinnamon
doughnuts with it was a Kilimanjaro
coffee and what was the other one so
there's one from Nepal which was a
Kilimanjaro on an appalling can enjoy
very different
Kilimanjaro is in Nepal Kilimanjaro in
Tanzania Charlie is actually googling
mother Kilimanjaro is in Nepal right now
Nepal is South America Kilimanjaro is
Africa okay so we had coffee from the
foothills of Kilimanjaro and coffee that
had been collected from Nepal so from
the foothills of Mount Everest and these
are very exclusive coffee flavored
certain espresso only really served in
Michelin star restaurant and then we
also have to try some new of the limited
edition of Discovery capsules this is
the Aero booster Uganda collection and
also the Arabica Ethiopia Harrah's they
have these limited edition ones for
serious Nespresso fans like like Dickie
creamy and then after our lovely dinner
we headed back to the Savoy back to our
little boys and had a lovely sleepover

I feel like this boy's a second little
name
so heading back home now it's a lovely
sunny morning I think we're gonna do

way to strand which is where a few
London Fashion meetings are happening
today I was madly able to see my the
skin is looking much better
very fresh radiant so I had the hydrates
and renew facial and it was only 20
minutes so really good if you're just
anything about shopping or you've got a
busy day in town really nice way to just
relax and have a bit of a skin pamper
session and now I'm heading to the

we had a talk with the model Halima who
is just amazing at representing
diversity and inclusivity within fashion
she was the first real kind of
supermodel that wears a burka and kind
of represents their runway to runway

conversation and then we went to one of
the British Fashion Council shows in the
kind of showroom space that was really
good fun then I went to the aspinall
presentation and they were showing their
new collection so many amazing bags
really cute little orange hat boxes and
then they had the new line collection
