make it through the game just have to
wait
you always pursue me good morning
darlings it is Tuesday and this week is
a really fun week of some amazing events
so I'm going to be vlogging the full a
tweak for you it's going to be an outfit
Diaries so I'm gonna of course be
showing you what I'm wearing I hope you
enjoyed that little get ready with me
that little time lapse as you can see I
have now tied my hair up because sadly
after the glorious bank holiday weekend
it is now rainy outside so I think if I
keep my hair in a bun until we get there
just got a little invisible in hopefully
when I arrive at the lunch destination I
will still have some curls so as I
mentioned at the end of last vlog which
went live on Monday evening if you
haven't caught that one then I'll leave
it up on the screen now that is all the
fun things that we got up to every bank
holiday weekend I did mention that this
week there are lots of events with
revolve they are here in the UK doing a
series of events here in London for
london-based vloggers so I'm very
excited to be going along to a few of
those it is a lunch today and it is a
Tularosa specific lunch
so naturally the top that I'm wearing is
Tularosa you may ooh well you've seen my
haul yet I think you will so yes you'll
have seen this top in my revolve all
which went live on Friday and then
because it is a crop top super last
acacia crop top I didn't want my tummy
button to be on show so I've decided to
go with these really amazing trousers as
super super high-waisted gorgeous tiered
material and these were from Zara again
if you saw my Zara haul I'm recommending
all the different videos and lots of
catching up to do if you haven't seen my
Zara haul because oh my gosh there is so
much amazing stuff in Zara at the moment
so I think these look pretty damn nice
with this top shoe wise I was going to
wear the Kate Spade ones that you can
see in the mirror there but actually
I've got a little cuts on my foot which
makes them a bit uncomfortable so I'm
wearing these beautiful little almost
like wicker sandals these are from
Topshop and they don't have anything
around the end
for the nice and comfy even with my cut
and then I'm going to be taking my
beautiful little Kate Spade bucket bag I
think this is just a perfect summer
handbag it somehow fits all of my stuff
in there all my essentials and it looks
absolutely adorable so that is my
finishing touch and because it's rainy I
think I'm gonna wear my amazing Topshop
Mac coat in fact I'm gonna put this on
and show you
I feel like this coat is definitely I
love it or hate it but I absolutely love
it so as you can see it is a see-through
raincoats I'm gonna feel really
interesting and walking through London
wearing this because it's not that warm
today either but I think I'll be fine so
yeah it's just like a trench coat with
this white lining and then it's totally
see-through and this is still on the top
shop website so I'll leave it linked
down below for you guys and yeah I just
upset you love it think it looks so cool
with my little handbag this is my
completed look
good morning darlings so you're probably
expecting this clip to be a clip from
the revolve lunch I didn't actually film
much at all during lunch aside from
showing you the amazing floral display
at the front sorry in advance about the
dog barking they're having one of these
morning's where I think they've seen a
fox so they're just going absolutely
crazy so if you can hear dog barking in
the background I do apologize Tyrone is
just afternoon it was such horrendous
weather it was absolutely pouring with
rain and I get really badly affected by
the weather when it's gloomy like it is
again today I just feel quite low I get
really low energy levels so I got home
from my dressing gown on and started to
do some work and then I managed to give
myself a migraine I feel like my body
gives me a migraine when it's telling me
to stop working if I work too hard and
yeah major energy dip and bit of
migraine situation yesterday so that is
why I'm picking up the vlog today today
is gonna be a really fun day so I'm
hoping that I will march on through we
are heading to your Clifden house you
may think that sounds familiar and
that's because it is where Megan Markel
got ready for her wedding day
beautiful big national Trust property
I've been there a couple of times before
but never afternoon teas stay the night
there I visited the spa it's so so
lovely so heading there this morning to
shoot and it is a revolver lunch there
there is a bus going from London but
Sinead and I actually gonna drive so we
get there a bit earlier and we are going
to do some pictures before everything
kicks off but before we head out I
wanted to show you and kind of do a
little bit of an unboxing for something
that arrived in our letterbox yesterday
this is a health box and is from Holland
and Barrett it's something new that they
are offering on their website and it's
something that I've just subscribed to
and it's such a genius idea it's one of
those things where you're like why has
no done this before that I thought I
would share it with you kind of leads on
from me feeling a bit rubbish yesterday
as well because basically this is a
imagine a monthly subscription box
filled with vitamins so this inside has
got my month supply of vitamins and I
basically did a questionnaire on the
Honda merit website it asked me all
about my lifestyle it asked me about my
nutrition so how many portions of fruit
vej I eat in a day and how much water I
drink how much alcohol caffeine etc I
drink and then also ask me about my
goals so do I want more energy do I want
better skin things like that a really
thorough questionnaire to cut two or
three minutes to fill in and then based
on my answers it has basically suggested
a selection of vitamins which I will
take every morning for the next 28 days
and then what you can do is create an
accounts and your health box will come
through your letterbox every single
month I was actually talking to
Charlie's boyfriend's sister during a
barbecue this weekend about vitamins and
we were saying that there's so many out
there and you can create your own
cocktail but you never know if you're
going to be getting too much vitamin C
or too much of a certain vitamin and you
don't want to overdose and you want to
make sure that you're getting what's
right for you as opposed to what the
latest marketing campaigns are telling
you that you need I don't eat that many
I don't need any fish and I don't eat
that much fruit and vegetables I'm
definitely a yellow food person so I
told my questionnaire that and it gave
me a little suggestion list so this is
what arrived yesterday let's open it up
and see what's inside
okay so inside it looks like this hi
Josie welcome to your personal guide
important information on food
supplements read this label carefully
before you start taking at this product
okay so this has got information about
all the different tablets so I've got
magnesium time-release wild rose hip
tablets vitamin E 1 in the morning
perfectly with a meal ok so basically in
here and also what's so good about this
is I travel a lot as you guys know and
in the past I've bought so many of these
little travel pill pots but I've always
not used them but this is really handy
they're like little contact lens cases
but they've got my recommended daily
amount it starts on a Monday what day is
it today I think it's Wednesday so I'm
gonna start with this one yeah at least
then I won't forget if I've taken on
that day it does say however to take
them with a meal and we don't have any
breakfast food in the house right now so
I'm actually just gonna pop these in my
hand
it's another reason why they're so handy
this is gonna go in my handbag and I
will take them probably at about 10
o'clock this morning once I found some
food gonna go and get a quest on but
yeah so this I think is just such a good
idea and so I'm very excited to be
working with Holland and Barrett to tell
you about them I will leave a link down
below which is where you can fill out
your questionnaire find out what kind of
vitamins you need and because it's from
Holland pirate obviously you know
they're going to be good quality you
know that it's a trustworthy place to
buy your vitamins from and it's just so
handy genius I'm a big fan so I'll keep
you updated with my vitamin process um
it's about 8 o'clock now the builders
should be arriving any second we're just
getting some tickling up done ever since
we had a leak Christmas so I will see
you on the road to lift them we have
made it safely to Clifton were a couple
of hours early ahead of the rest of the
gang which is great too because that
means that Sinead and I she lays here
Hey a vision in pink very weather
appropriate
yeah we're just going to get couple of
snaps before the rest of the revolt gang
get here so we are at the beautiful
Clifton as you can see gorgeous gorgeous
property oh I know it's such a shame
isn't it
such a shame and we're gonna get some
beautiful photos so we're gonna shoot
her first outfit I'm wearing top and
rousers from lovers and friends which is
the label that we are having at lunch
and we're here at Clifton so we've got
this beautiful actually you probably
have seen this already in Mayra vocal
but yeah really beautiful cross over top
and rich trout rails then I've got my
Kate Spade sandals on my lovely little
strappy bag
I love always for the ridin spot the
blogger's we bumped into Ben and Katie
give it away with such beauty all right
so we are onto outfit number two and we
are gonna shoot on this beautiful
balcony now I'm actually wearing what I
was wearing yesterday certainly to the
rows of top so our our trials and
Topshop shoes because it was so pouring
with rain yesterday I think any photos
so I'm gonna ropes Maidan to get
stay forever
bird meat so before paper made a fall
social need and I have been shooting for
the past hour and a half maybe and I
think the rest of the gang are due to
arrive here any second now we've had a
sneak preview of the room while having
lunch and it's absolutely beautiful
they'd have behind the scenes bloggers
action we're now using the shade of the
car to and L photos laptop out just
adding them into Lightroom and of course
I'm going to be adding the fashion
remember priesthoods and then we're
heading inside the lunch but it's a
really beautiful room and the general
manager was just explaining that all of
the decoration was originally from a
French palace and at the time the
richest man in the world who loved the
surroundings of the French palace so
much that he decided to bring them all
over to Krypton so it's just my
spectacular room I'll show you what it
look like and to start we have a
beetroot heritage salad okay darlings so
I am on my way home after a really
really lovely lunch at Clifton we had a
bit of a chat from the general manager
before we start down for lunch
sorry about the wobbly camera my current
set-up is not ideal
yeah the general manager basically told
us loads about the scandalous history of
Clifton house which as I'm sure you will
know
when Megan Markel actually got ready for
the royal wedding so they're obviously
really really proud of that and their
amazing history so it's lovely to have
lunch there we had a really tasty
three-course lunch and I'm really glad
that Sinead and I went there early we
could have got a bus with the rest of
the girls but I don't know if any other
vloggers get this if you're another
blogger and you feel this way as well
then let me know but basically I often
get like content anxiety which sounds
really ridiculous but it's basically
like if I go somewhere really beautiful
and if I don't have a huge amount of
time I'll get really stressed until I
get the content that I need and I know
that that's super tragic but that is
just how I feel I get I can't relax
until I get the perfect photos and I
know it's totally ridiculous but you
know if any other bloggers feel that way
let me know so yeah actually and I went
early to get the snaps and we could just
chill and enjoy the lunch which we
absolutely did it was so so nice got
some really lovely photos there's a
really nice drive back home I think this
is probably sadly one of my last drives
in the Mazda I think we have to hand it
back soon because we've been loaning it
for the past like six months or so
typical just as I'm like getting into
the swing of being really confident
driving we're gonna have to hand it back
but we love this car so much that I
think we're actually gonna buy it it's
fairly affordable I think this car is
like under 30,000 pounds yet it has
loads of amazing technology things that
I have come to rely on like it's got a
reverse camera when I pop the car into
reverse I can see in my little screen
exactly what's going on behind me it's
got Lane Assist so if I and my spacial
awareness is not the best so if I just
slightly like jolt our lane then it very
subtly just pushes me back in the
steering wheel has like it'll vibrate
and it pushes you back
what other things
it's got like blind spot flippers so if
someone's in your blind spot then it'll
just like give me a bib and it'll tell
you this and their if you start to
indicate just so many things that now
I'm like oh my gosh I could never tried
without this though very tempted to look
at getting one of these on Finance a
little car update for you so yes after
an hour's drive I am gonna be back home
shortly it's half for now I have a
dinner with Rhys tonight which I'm
really excited about as you guys know I
wear a lot of reason I'm a big big fan
and we have a really lovely dinner with
their new Women's Wear editors will be
lovely to meet haha I think it's a her
yeah really nice evening planned I will
see you guys when I am ready I remember
when you put a spell on me drop me
flying crazy
couldn't see back then what so in front
of me this goes long gone baby you got
me good here you got me bad and your bed
as they come boy all the time sir
good morning darling
it is now Friday today I have already
had a cup of meetings and vintage em but
I forgot mascara in my gym bag I'm
feeling like a bit of a mole at the
moment I'm now at Westfield I'm coming
for a little relaunch in the aspects or
running a bit late so I will see you
when we get there okay so in the
beautiful and newly refurbished happened
so I'll show you around in a second
first I'm going to unbox a very special
gift I'm gonna pop the camera down and
show you what's inside I will show you
from distance as a turnout
all I want from you listen and remember
the good times if you think of all that
will be out is a wave your finger
I don't nothing ever I turn out as you
wanted
every time
my eyes is Kahlua
so I can give you a sneak peak in
Spanish when you back this is
giant trunk and if he launched my
passion week blog you may remember
seeing me building in love with this
request show and since the lion trouble
these guys were nice with my name
morning darlings I feel like you
probably were expecting a little bit
more footage from yesterday and to be
honest I just forgot to vlog I have no
excuse so sorry that Friday was cut a
little bit short what should we do last
night and oh it turned out to be a
really nice evening after all the rain
so China I went for a nice long walk and
then we went for pizza at a place near
us called Radio Alice and they do the
best sourdough pizzas and you don't feel
like gross and full afterwards and then
we went to see Deadpool to which I quite
enjoyed it's like a comedy quite rude
like superhero like it's one of the
marble things I quite enjoyed because I
had zero expectations whereas Charlie I
think had really high expectations and
Deadpool have been spending millions on
advertising like they did this advert
with David Beckham they did this whole
movie on the Manchester United Instagram
I mean how many instruments have money
knighted got probably like 50 million
that probably cost them oh my gosh like
hundreds of thousands to sponsor video
on Man United Instagram so yeah putting
all the budget behind it so Charlie had
really high expectations and he actually
came out quite disappointed but I
thought it was funny and I like Ryan
Reynolds so yeah that was fine today is
Saturday I've just got out the shower
I'm not going to gym today because we
also did some gardening you have to say
and I feel like I burn a lot of calories
doing the gardening so I'm letting
myself off today I am just about to do
my makeup do my hair and then do a bit
of filming so it's a beautiful day
outside and I don't think the weather's
gonna be nice and also I just don't have
time over the next few days to film
anything so I need to film Wednesday's
video Monday you're gonna get this vlog
so yeah I need to film next Wednesday
and every first Wednesday of each month
I'm now going to do a what's new my
wardrobe and that way it
help because I do a lot of hauls on my
channel and I also very kind to get
gifted a lot of pieces from brands and a
lot of you guys are like oh my gosh what
do you do with all these clothes I'm
actually quite strong with what I keep
and what I don't keep so what I don't
keep I send to this shop and it's called
like a stock exchange and basically the
shop owners they present it really
beautifully like you would never think
it was almost like a charity shop and
then the owners keep 50% of the profits
and then 50% goes to charity so a lot of
my clothes go there which is why my
wardrobes are not bursting at the seams
but then I think its own obviously I
give my friends and family quite hot
stuff as well but I thought I think
what's new and my wardrobe video is it
good because then it shows you what I've
edited down and what I'm actually
keeping in my personal wardrobe so
that's what I'm going to be sure it's
coming to the channel every first
Wednesday of each month it's already
June so a third of all second of June
today so this Wednesday coming up will
be the first Wednesday in June so I'll
be filming the June edition and I'm also
going to film a dupes video because I've
been finding a lot of handbag dupes a
lot of fashion Jeeves alot of footwear
dupes so that's the plan today I will
quickly whizz through my makeup I feel
like I don't need to do another
hyperlapse but I'm gonna be trying out a
new primer from bare minerals a brand
that I adore this is called they're good
hydrations silky face primers I'm going
to start with that then I'm going to do
my hair also just to show you in normal
lighting my beautiful new bag so this is
the Aspinall lion trunk bag and I'm just
so so grateful they gifted this to me
yesterday at the store visit which was
so kind of them and as you guys know I
just love astronaut trunk bags I wear my
cream and camel colored one so much and
I've got the full camel colored one and
this one is just so much fun it's
surprising how much you can fit in there
as well and I also have the strap
engraved so you can see that says Josie
on there and they do free
personalization in the stores so
definitely go and check out the new one
in or the newly refresh run in Westerly
film nearby or if you're around central
the aspinall on Regent Street is just
stunning anyway I need to stop rambling
I'm going to do my makeup and
with you guys just before I start
filming okay so hair and makeup is done
I'm gonna add a bit of hairspray and of
aluminized in a second I also just
popped this top one which i think is
really really cute it's from ASOS it's
got these lovely little frill sleeves I
think it looks quite like Chloe ish it's
a big fan of that don't I give you a
vitamin update I have to say the fact
that they come in these little packets
is my favorite thing because I often
don't eat a big enough breakfast in the
house I often have like breakfast
meetings so I've just been popping the
packets in my handbag and it's
absolutely amazing so I'm gonna take my
Saturday ones today now and then tonight
I'm actually staying overnight at the
Langham I got a hotel room there because
it's so beautiful it's very expensive
but it is really beautiful and I have a
couple of projects that I need to shoot
for so I thought I would treat myself
and obviously then get a nice overnight
stay in London as well and I've got some
things going on in the morning which I
can attend to very easily so obviously I
can then take my Sunday packet with me
for overnight stays and then when I go
to the lengths here next week on so 10 I
can just take the perfect ones for that
so that's a little bit of an update I'm
gonna now fill my dupes video I'll see
you guys afterwards

camera is charging upstairs but I just
had to show you this blogger mail but
