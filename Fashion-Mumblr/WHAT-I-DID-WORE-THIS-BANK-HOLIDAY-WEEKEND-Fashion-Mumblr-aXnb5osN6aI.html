is more
me
good morning darlings it is bank holiday
it's Saturday and we've got a really fun
weekend and so I thought I would get
back into the swing of vlogging and
bring you guys along with me it is 11
o'clock now Charlie and I have had a
good start to the day we both caught up
had a bit of a lion we didn't set our
alarms and then we went straight to the
gym did a really good workouts a bit of
an hour blast didn't film anything
because obviously we weren't in the PT
studio so I don't want to upset anyone
by getting anyone in the background but
really good session and then we went to
our favorite butchers and got loads of
meat loads of vegetables and things like
that and then the farmers market to pick
up even more vegetables for the weekend
because we're probably gonna end up
having quite a few barbecues we've
messaged those different friends and
hopefully we're going to have some
people taking up our offer and have a
couple of barbecues over the weekend so
I've just made my usual breakfast
smoothie I feel like I've told you about
this smoothie a million times it's
basically banana blueberry strawberry
the super elixir and some like protein
oats chia seeds almond milk basically
whatever is in my healthy cupboard so
this is gonna be my breakfast for the
day and then we are going to head to
Petersham nurseries shortly I hope
you're gonna head out as soon as we've
both showered which is really really
beautiful place in the Richmond it is a
garden nursery but they also have a
michelin-starred cafe and it's just a
really beautiful place to go on a bank
holiday weekend and then maybe take the
hounds for a walk around Richmond Park
so that's the plan for today also I'm
setting myself and Charley a bit of a
challenge I've been talking to various
people quite a lot recently about like
single-use plastics and recycling and
just trying to be a lot more sustainable
so this week and you guys can monitor it
for me I'm setting myself a challenge of
not using any single-use plastic so
obviously that means and the plastic
bearing shops I'm going to always carry
a little
and canvas tote bag with me no plastic
coffee cups so luckily I have this
really cute little cup this one was
actually part of a blogger mail from
bourgeois but I'm going to keep this in
my handbag so when I need my oat milk
latte I can ask them to make it in that
and then I've also got my water bottle
this one is from L'Occitane again I got
this at a blog event but if I'm right I
think that they are still giving the
whip these away in some of their stores
where if you spend twenty pounds you get
this for free and then also you can like
top it up whenever you go past a water
fountains you don't need to buy plastic
bottles so those are the three main
things and a plastic straws as well so
we use metal straws at home for our
smoothies and then you're not throwing
away plastic straws every single time
I'll probably think of some normal ways
of reducing our plastic use throughout
the week but I think it's really
important to try and hopefully some of
you guys will try as well so let me know
if you try out this little one week of
no single use plastic challenge have fun
but yeah that's what I'm going to try to
do this week try and be really good and
I'm sure it'll be really easy actually
and I'll just continue like that so
setting myself a challenge to get into
the habit okay I'm gonna go up and have
a shower I will see you guys on the road
to your petition
all aboard my little cherubs
okay so we have just got back from our
lovely afternoon out I didn't vlog too
much because we were just having a
really chilled time we didn't actually
get to go to peach from nurseries
because there was no parking anywhere we
ended up down this little Lane and I had
to reverse and fight with loads of other
cars trying to turn around so it's very
stressful and we had a really nice
little picnic and walk around Richmond
Park this is what I've been wearing all
day I want to show you this top because
it's so so nice I've also been wearing
some denim shorts but yeah the top is 32
pounds and absolutely love it everything
that I wear in this vlog be linked down
below as always
um but yeah so I've just got back home I
have not tidied my blogger mail and
general stuff for the whole week pretty
much I just kind of dump stuff in this
room I've had quite a lot of shoot days
and so I've got a suitcase I need some
packing so I'm gonna have a bit of a tie
gets afternoon it's about half for now
we've got some friends coming around at
half six for a Barbie so I thought
before I do a mad idea I'll show you
some of the bloggers Malcolm this week
let's start with this box this is from
LMS which is one of my favorite skincare
brands inside we have got a selection of
products for the bridal season so it
says everyone wants to feel like a
princess that is very cute just a plain
white tea with the word bride on there
and then we have got a selection of LMS
products first of all their cellular
recurrent cellular recovery skin bliss
capsules day and night facial oils
apparently don't think I've tried these
before they come in this big tub like
this ooh so you have some light pink
capsules and some light blue ones as
well they look like this so I guess you
just burst one over skin in the morning
and over the skin in the evening it says
they are antioxidant facial oils then we
have something called the cell utox
active body cleansing oil I don't if
this is to use in the shower apply daily
after a horrible bath or sharp shower
for a small mountainous apollon rough
over problem areas like the abdomen
buttocks and
okay so I guess this is one of those
anti like lemon skin products which
sounds amazing I'm so glad they put one
of these in this is their Pro collagen
eye masks and they're huge fan of these
as is Charlie we always take them on
airplanes with us so good for just
getting rid of any fine lines and
wrinkles around the eyes it really helps
to refresh them and last but not least
they're pro radiance flash bomb so this
would be your final step before putting
on your makeup leaves it's gonna make a
really lovely and dewy and it's also got
some like super super fruits in there
which is great for anti-aging as well so
that is a super generous delivery from
LMS then I also have something from by
Killian says love the way you feel oh
wow oh my goodness that is possibly the
most beautiful by Killian bottle design
I have ever seen look love the way you
feel so it's like the traditional bottle
but in white with this beautiful like a
paint's wash going across the top let's
see how this smells oh my goodness that
smells absolutely gorgeous that is so
light it's almost got notes of like the
kind of scent of the Sun cream I can't
pick it I didn't smell like Sun cream
but it reminds me of summer holidays and
just feeling really warm after a day in
the Sun that that could potentially be
an everyday summer fragrance very very
nice thank you bye Killian next is a
couple of products from the genifique
yeux range from lancome so the eye range
specifically for anti-aging this is
another set of eye masks not tried any
eye masks from Lancome looks like they
come in these individual packets like
this these are the eye masks inside this
is really handy again for traveling so
great to have a stock of those of you
interested see how they compare to the
LMS ones and this is a youth activating
smoothing eye cream everyday lack of
sleep pollution and external aggressors
may contribute to premature signs of
aging in dark circles our most advanced
youth activating cream is proven to
reduce the appearance of fine lines
wrinkles dark circles and dehydration
that sounds amazing exactly what I need
I am almost out of my existing la Mer
eye creams I'll be switching this into
my daily skincare routine and I'll let
you know
how I get along with that one I would
say is the area that I'm starting to get
most concerns about science of aging
I do get quite a lot of fine lines
especially after a day in the city or if
my skin's a bit dehydrated so definitely
an area that I am looking to invest in
my skincare
there's the blogger male bits I had on
the top there I also want to quickly
show you my cute little bag this is new
from Kate Spade it is a bucket bag it's
so adorable it's got a little drawstring
top I got this actually yesterday so I
did a little job with Kate Spade which
is amazing is I just know it so much
when I get to work with brands I
actually I mean I would never work with
brand if I didn't love them but when
it's a brand that I love on another
level like Kate Spade it's just such an
amazing part of this job that I'm so so
grateful for so to work with them yes
there is really fun I'll tell you
actually what it was all about so in
their Regent Street store they have this
area upstairs and they have a specific
room and it's filled with confetti last
week it was filled with giant balloons
next week it's gonna be filled up
something else which is a surprise and
if you go into that room and take a
photo and upload it with I think it's
Kate Spade and Y 25 years I'm not sure
up with a hashtag on the screen if you
upload a photo with that hashtag taken
in that room and you can win either a
huge shopping spree around the store get
those some nice creates paid clothes you
can win a trip to New York or there's
another prize as well so that's what I
was promoting if I have a video clip of
me in the store in the confetti room or
actually we took some really fun
boomerangs so put some of those on the
screen now but I got this bag as a
result of doing that collaboration with
them and also this dress in the
background which is so so beautiful I
also got a pair of shoes which I'll also
show you yeah so I got this amazing pair
of shoes they're literally the perfect
so much shoot there are nude pink colors
they're gonna go with everything a
chunky block heel and this gorgeous
ruffle detail along the front there so
these are just dreamy that dress looks
so amazing on again I'll put something
on the screen now if I've got any video
clips where you can see how dreamy it is
and yeah it's a little mini update from
me I'm gonna now tidy up the room I'll
show you a little hyperlapse
that may be what she means how do you
have a bedroom and I will chat with you
guys when we are preparing for a
barbecue bit later I just realized I
have another blogger mail this arrived
and it sounded really weird I thought
that was something broken in it so I was
very pleased to see that it was just
just painting
it's from Essie and they've popped in a
selection of their new I presume that
summer shades so it says they are
celebrating the colorful history behind
the brand by bringing color to life in
fun everyday hand moments right so let's
have a look these are certainly very
very bright shades we have got a nail
strengthener which looks like this coral
color if it's a nail strengthener I'm
guessing it's gonna be clear though so
stronger nails in just one week let's
peeling less breakage that sounds
amazing strengthener and fortifier and
also a bit of color
oh okay so maybe they are colored but
it's saying that gives you color and
repair all in one it's that's a lilac
one then we've got some really super
bright shades these are perfect toenail
shades for me we've got a really
stunning pearly color this is literally
like almost like an icy pearl shade and
if you can see how pearly that is I get
a lot of questions about my nails I do
normally get shellac on my fingers just
because I find that it lasts really long
and I don't like to have chips on my
nails this is a shade called uncovered
and I went to London grace which is a
salon on Clapham High Street they've got
a few in London though I would highly
recommend going there but I do like to
use normal polish on my toes but I do
like to get them pedicured every now and
then as well so these will definitely be
really good toe colors who got very
fresh like a turquoise of purple this is
very me this one is called young wild
and me really really like that almost a
blush pink then we have another
treatment color this is more like a
brownie lilac shade this would be really
good actually in between gels so if and
when I have a break from getting
Gentleman ELLs it was really nice to
continue having color on but also treat
my nails to some treatment
it says these will be $7.99 each
they are out now
okay back downstairs again and I'm going
to make my beauty balls you've seen me
making these a million times before my
recipe changes a little bit depending on
what we have got in our cupboard at any
particular time if you want to make
these yourself
I did do a blog post all about my recipe
so I'll leave it linked down below it's
got some nice images as well in this
recipe it says why they're so good so
energy-boosting they've got like Beauty
boosting ingredients and what you'll
need ingredients steaks coconut oil
pistachios things like that so I'm gonna
make those now and then they'll be in
the fridge process and I call the rest
of the week
