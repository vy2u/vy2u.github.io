what I eat in a day video so today is
going to be a slightly healthy day for
me at least and at the moment I'm really
trying to get excited by new recipes
that are healthy and nutritious I'm not
completely like cutting out the mac and
cheese or the burgers or anything but
I'm definitely trying to incorporate
more healthy food into my lifestyle and
I have been to like a few blog events
recently like the origins of her
farmhouse when Madeline Shaw was there
and also my weekend in the Cotswolds of
the lakes where we were fed by betina's
kitchen and it was all vegan plant-based
cooking so had a few experiences
recently which has made me realize that
I do actually like healthy food so yeah
basically quite healthy day I made some
overnight oats Berkshire last night so
I'm going to start by having that for
breakfast and then we're having some
friends over for a barbecue so I'm
actually going to create a few recipes
from Madeline shores Ready Steady Go
book which we're really kindly given by
Madeline at the origins event so I
thought we'd quite fun date to share
with you my journey to trying to be a
little bit healthier so as per always
I'm starting the day with a cup of tea
this one annoying he doesn't have a
label but it's from a brand called
positivity which were also at the
origins event they've collaborated with
the rituals or ritual a tea collection
but I let it get a bit cold
it's realized that she probably talked
to the camera and yeah I let it get a
bit cold because I was filming a makeup
routine or I was
first impressions of beach products and
I let it get cold while I was filming so
luckily with these couple tea bags you
can normally get like three or four uses
out of them so if I have just a little
bit of tea at the end of my monk I'll
always just heat up the kettle again and
boil it so yes
herbal teas can be a bit more expensive
but I probably get four mugs of tea out
of every single ones I've just bought at
the kettle to make myself a another cup
of tea from him to see bag so here's my
oats that I made last night
following the recipe which is in
Madeline's book I will leave a link to
it down below so if you want to look you
can get took me maybe like 15 minutes to
make these yesterday really easy
although I did cut my thumb while
embracing the carrot so it's carrot oats
cinnamon honey and a few of the things I
can't remember but so convenient like
having to make it night before because I
would never be bothered to make this now
so a really good one if you rush around
before you head out for the day
I'm going to attempt to make it a little
bit more photogenic because currently
it's just in some Tupperware I've got
enough here for chai as well and I think
I'm going to put some pumpkin seeds
maybe a bit of coconut and some more
honey on top
I cannot even explain to you how nice
this smells I think it's probably the
cinnamon but it just smells so
comforting so I'm excited to dig in can
it deliver Charlie his portion I'm gonna
put some honey on top as well hum put
the honey on yet and Madeline Shaw's
book said you can have it with natural
yoghurt which I would do but we don't
have any in the house so I'm just going
to enjoy it as it is
okay guys it's a little bit later on it
is now 11 o'clock in the morning I have
filmed my September new in beauty
launches video after finishing my
character Bert Show which was
surprisingly filling didn't think how to
fill me up
Dexter's whining because charlie is dead
to go outside for a whole 30 seconds um
so yeah I've just come downstairs after
filming and behind me here you can see
Charlie has laid out some vegetables so
it looks like he's gonna make us a juice
which he often does I'd say five out of
seven days a week he makes a juice or we
have a juice sometimes he makes two days
in one go and it's really healthy so
let's have a look so we've got cucumber
beetroot apple carrot ginger spinach and
celery celery is normally fairly
disgusting tasting but it's so good for
you and yeah lots of nice ingredients
only one Apple apples are really good
for sweetness adding a nice taste but
they are quite sugary so not the
healthiest but yeah one one Apple won't
do us too much harm um so yeah Charlie's
coming back now I can see him and while
he makes the juice I'm gonna empty the
dishwasher and then we're gonna start
preparing some food for our barbecue
later
okay so it's half 11:00 now we've got an
hour and a half until one o'clock which
is when we told people to start coming
and Charlie and I aren't gonna be making
a few things to go with the barbecue
stuff so from Madeline's book I'm gonna
make these roasted sweet potatoes with
flaked almonds you are yep and also what
else we gonna do is it chicken chicken
kabobs with cashew satay which I might
start by making those and then we are
also gonna make a salad which I can't
find in the book but it's basically kale
mozzarella and beetroot
so I'm going to start by making the
sauce for the chicken satays and also
making the marinade for the chicken as
well
in the fridge as you saw I've just gotta
leave it for as long as possible
basically so that all the 19th
ingredients and sinks in and then I've
prepared this little jug with all the
ingredients for the sauce and as you saw
I cooked cashews just roasted them
slightly and they are cooling down on
top of the toaster behind me
so once the cashews have cooled down I
will stick them in the Thermomix
and then blend this in as well and
that'll be our cashew chicken satay
dipping sauce and while I'm waiting for
the cashews to cool down I'm just making
the dressing for our salad so I'm making
a kale beetroot mozzarella salad so at
the moment I'm just grating some orange
zest and in my bowl already I've got
apple cider vinegar olive oil and honey
it's going to be nice and tasty
yesterday Charlie and I went to a
farmers market on Ben Street which is
near us in Clapham and we picked up some
nice vegetables and things I've asked
though I've also got a big bag of
organic kale so a lot more from money
and disseminate better and Charlie has
just chopped up the world's biggest
spinach leaves which were also from the
market so I'm gonna race the kale and
then I'm gonna add my salad sauce which
is the yellow one that I made earlier
and Peter style and then all that's left
to do for salad is tear up some
mozzarella stick that in there and put
in the beetroot slices which Charlie
cooked earlier and then the spring roll
on the pumpkin seeds so not too
difficult
all righty so time for a little update
here's a couple of hours since I last
picked up the camera it's now half past
2 and our friends are all here so I have
just come into the kitchen and I put the
chicken on the skewers so it's looking
good got all the chicken laid up down
here Charlie has made them glow about
him since I've been nibbling a little
bit as well and yeah we're just all
wheels in motion getting the barbecue
ready also nibbled on little bit of
sausage his max say hello max look black
and yeah so we made a huge error we have
our neighbors barbecue here but we
forgot to buy a new gas cylinder so
annoyingly we're having to use slings
freeze disposable barbecues but that's
okay it all tastes the same Chaz has got
some halloumi on the table this is Dan
say hi Dan hello I'm putting everybody
on the spot today and Bella who is
Sophie Matt's dog she's there in the
corner and dictature girlfriends so
they're having a wonderful day so on the
table we've got some halloumi which I
think Chaz is gonna put on the fire and
then we also got some burgers from say
nose beef steak West Country cheddar
caramelized onion and this one is
caramelized red onion as well so it's
looking good
a bit like the bees we take a walk we
love each other we love each other they
can do anything so the boys are all
outside cooking the meat on the barbecue
but I think I'm gonna do my chicken
skewers inside or I am doing my chicken
skewers in sight but I've got them on
the pan behind me cooking em through
coconut oil just turning them over every
minute or so and also been munching on
some crisps these are the in kettle
chips smoky barbecue flavor and I don't
really like barbecue flavor but these
they're not too strong so yeah pretty
enjoying those one of our friends really
finely pour over some dog treats so we
have three dogs kissed babies at 16 not
that this is the what Dex eat in a day
although that could be quite fun only
he's got some jumbo twisters it quickly
will keep them busy while we are eating
so yeah I'm just gonna carry on doing my
chicken skewers and then I think
to expose your babe I'm just trying to
see you when your mother
not
hear me but barbecue food was a huge
success
I had salumi sweet potato chips and she
can everybody have gone home now it's a
little bit later
Dexter is currently trying to hump my
leg I don't know what it is whenever I
put on his dressing-gown maybe it's
because it's like I don't know maybe it
smells like me but he always tries to
hold my legs I was talking to you that
but anyway back to the why eat in a day
so um yeah the last thing I ate was a
Cornetto ice cream treating myself so
strawberry Cornetto Dexter come on and
then I just made myself a coffee it's
suddenly gone a little bit chilly and
I'm feeling a tad lethargic and I need
to shower and in some videos and stay
awake until well not going to bed at 6
o'clock basically so just made myself a
coffee um I've been using these capsules
from a brand called from a brand called
Gore meso and they're basically like
they are Nespresso capsules but they're
much cheaper look Weez doing stop it
here a little tear adapter so yeah they
just taste like Nespresso but they're
half the price I've been using those
recently I've got a coffee with milk and
two sugars oh boy I am
what are you doing Dex trying to shred
mummys dressing down come on guys I just
had that awkward thing where you go to
have a nap and you intend in that for 20
minutes and then you end up napping
three hours is now like half past nine
so it's really close to my bedtime yeah
so the afternoon has literally just
disappeared I was so shiny I need to
take my makeup off and so yeah to be
honest I'm still so full I don't think
I'm gonna eat anything else if I do
anything I might have a caramel or 11 to
tea before bed just to try and help me
sleep again I guess because I'm probably
not gonna be able to get sleep for a
little while seeing as I just woke up
from a 3-hour nap but yeah I just
thought I would update you because I'm
probably not gonna eat anything else
today all that lovely healthy food was
very very filling
so quite pleased with myself that I
managed a whole day without properly
having any processed foods I guess
because everything I had today we made
ourselves and it was from farmers
markets so yeah very impressed this is
really unlike me I have to stress you
guys know I love a good macaroni cheese
etc but yeah definitely gonna try and
fit some more of that kind of food in
more often and I really enjoyed using
Madeline's book so yeah I recommend that
one but I'm gonna sign off let me know
if you enjoyed this video and if you
want some more what I use in the days
I'm not promising that all gonna be this
healthy but yeah let me know if you'd
like to see some more if you want any
special ones like what I eat when I'm on
a holiday what I eat during Fashion Week
because that's coming up very soon yeah
just let me know what you'd like to see
and your wish is my command
so that is all from me I will see you
very facing I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
