January today and it is the day that
everyone goes back to work myself
included I've spent the whole morning
catching up on emails that I just
ignored over the Christmas period and
just working from home all day today
getting some blog posts written etc etc
this year I haven't really set myself
any news resolutions and I'm definitely
not doing any diets or anything like
that because that's just not the type of
person that I am but what I am trying to
do this month and charlie is doing along
with me is we're trying not to eat
things that have been made by factories
that's a really weird way of describing
it which I'm not to eat so many
processed foods like obviously no packet
meals which I'm not to even eat out too
much obviously from a financial point of
view eating out it's really expensive
and we like cooking so we're gonna try
to make as much as possible slash
everything from scratch here at home
this month so I thought it'd be quite an
interesting time to do a what I eat in a
week I will show you a few clips of my
January workouts as well my personal
trainer
thank goodness if they can't draw at the
moment so he's not here - totally
torturous but he'll be back probably by
the end of the week and I'll be doing
some workouts in the gym eccentric
cetera so I'll show you a few clips of
that but it's mainly going to be what we
are eating this week so a couple of days
ago I made a ginormous Accardo order I
used the cookie do website which if
you've not heard me rambling about
thermomix before then basically my
Thermomix
this device here is my most amazing
kitchen gadget that cooks so many meals
it's basically loads and loads of
different kitchen gadgets all in one and
it can make your entire meal for you I
rave about it so much I have a whole
blog post about I love it and I'll leave
that link down below but yeah so
basically the Thermomix has a little
chip on the side of it
this little contraption here and that
links it up to the Internet and then you
can go on the cookie new website and
choose the recipes that you want to make
that week so I did that I've got a load
of recipes written down in my diary that
I'm going to cooking this week and I
ordered all the ingredients so we've got
everything in the house that we need for
the recipes today I'm making a ham and
leek pasta for lunch and then we're
doing a chicken SOG which is probably
our favorite summer mix recipe for
dinner where possible and also go to
making some slightly healthier swaps so
if it says oil for example I'll use
coconut oil things like that where it
says pasta I've got spinach pasta so
trying to make healthy swaps where
possible but should be really nice to
make everything from scratch this week
and I will show you how I do them all so
it's just gone 12 now so far today I
have just had a green tea this is a
green tea I think it's a kippah green
tea it's like green tea organic green
tea and mint yeah that's what I had this
morning and then I put in a little bit
of manuka honey we're kind of fighting
off colds charlie has major monthly at
the moment so he's having a lot of green
tea with honey mint and ginger that is
like a failsafe recipe and then I did
actually have a yoghurt this morning I
can't resist my little crunch corny
yoghurt so I did have one of those which
is of course a processed food but I am
gonna be looking at healthier recipes
for breakfast breakfast is always my
weakness I just come downstairs starving
and grab myself a yogurt but yeah it's
not just time now so I'm gonna start
making my hand and leek so as I said I'm
going to be making it on my thermal mix
if you don't have a thermal mix you can
probably make this recipe yourself like
just on the hob or whatever but I just
find it so much easier to use this I use
this so much over Christmas I made beef
wellington using this let me show you so
these are all the recipes I've got in my
favourites
we've got courgette and feta risotto
having Nick pasture beef wellington pea
and mint risotto this is what I made on
Christmas I know on New Year's Eve I
made a petit poor and pancetta risotto
and it was absolutely delicious took me
just half an hour made that for the six
of us for New Year's Eve but yeah today
at making the Hammond leek pasta and
these are the ingredients that I need
so bacon cubes leeks olive oil plain
flour milk vegetable stock and then
obviously my pasta my leek and bacon is
try to be sauteing in the machine it
says it's going to be going for five
minutes
the blades are just gently stirring it
and it's going up to 120 degrees which
should cook the leeks and the bacon in
the olive oil this is one thing I love
about Thermomix if I was doing this on
the hob I'd be stood there stirring and
maybe add a little oil and stirring and
stirring rows now I have five minutes
the machine is doing its magic and I can
carry on with other things I have just
been looking at my videos scheduled I've
been trying to like plan the videos I'm
going to be doing over the next few
weeks and I think this video is going to
replace my usual Monday weekly vlog
because usually on Mondays I do my
waterside war in a week my outfit
diaries but this week I'm pretty much
just working from home all day so maybe
wearing something like this every single
day
and it's not really going to change so
that would be a very boring outfit re so
this is what you're getting
instead hope that's okay but my outfit
of the day this is a jumper that Jules
actually sent to me a couple of
Christmases ago and it's one of my most
worn things by wear in the house it's
just so comfortable if they have
anything similar I'll leave a link down
below and then these little trousers are
pale pink and just super soft jogging
bottoms from
Goldin quite recently so again they
should be still in stock and I will
leave them linked and my slippers are
EMU and they're just ones that I wear
every single day in the house starts the
outfit of the day my bacon the leeks
have got two minutes left so I am going
to tidy up the chopping board
my lunch is complete so that took about
20 minutes so we have I actually went
before these big I think they called
like crunchy Nellie pasta shells instead
of the healthy pasta which I know
charlie will have with his leek sauce
later but basically we had this big bag
of pasture didn't fit in our cupboard so
it was just taking up kitchen worktop
space I thought you know I'm just gonna
use it up so this is my lunch time to
enjoy finish my pasta and in all honesty
I'm just kind of procrastinating now
because I don't want to go back to work
but what I'm gonna do with the
ingredients here behind me is make my
delicious energy balls or energy bars I
think I've spoken about these in
probably every single other what I eat
in a day or week video before so we
won't go into it too much but I
basically love to make these so that
when I have hunger pangs in the day if I
want something to eat in my coffee then
these are really good time in the fridge
and they are for the goodness - they
always give you lots of energy and also
the ingredients that I use which I'll go
through in a second have lots of like
superfood benefits for example maca
powder is really good for balancing
hormones I've got the cheer read maca
guarana and baobab these are good like
energizing good for your skin so let me
show you the ingredients I don't stick
to the same ingredients for every single
time that I do these Bulls but what you
do always need is some dates these are
actually out of date my dates are out of
date but it doesn't really matter
they're they'll be fine and I've got
some dates that are in date here as well
what you do need is dates you need some
cacao powder to make them nice and
chocolaty this is from rainforest foods
you'll need some coconut oil to make
sure that everything sticks together and
then just a selection of seeds and
superfoods so I've got some pumpkin
seeds I'll probably put in a few almonds
and I've got some pistachio nuts as well
some dried berries and cherries and then
I'm also putting in a load of different
superfoods so we have this kind of
healthy cupboard up here where we keep
all of our superfoods and today I'm
gonna pop in a few scoop Falls of the
energized powder this
got shear cacao maca read maca guarana
and baobab and this is from a company
called love raw then I'm gonna pop in a
little bit of the organic berry blend
from Neal's Yard remedies these are
really good little and super food
pouches I've got quite a lot of those
the Chico I'm gonna pop in some white
chia seeds are not sure the differences
between white sheer normal chair but
gonna pop some of those in goji berries
I don't actually blend up I use these
more for kind of decoration at the end
and I just love goji berries it's
especially good to have goji berries at
this time of year they're very good for
just giving your body the nutrients it
might be lacking at this time of year
like copper iron all those kind of
things to help boost the immune system
and then this is a brand that I tried at
the end of last year and really really
liked them
it's called Vita glow or Vita glow and
this is our marine collagen powder so
it's really good for your skin your hair
your nails and very easy to include in a
beauty ball recipe I've got some extra
baobab again they've got lots of
vitamins fibers etc in there great too
for this time of year so what I do is
basically pop everything in the
Thermomix
and then mush it together into some
healthy little balls
so my cheer bulls are all done cheer
Bulls healthy bulls whatever you want to
call them and they're all done and
they're in the fridge so they set the
nice and hard here a little bit soft at
the moment I have made myself a coffee
just to give myself a little bit of an
energy boost it's only two o'clock in
the afternoon but it's already quite
dark and dreary so I'm gonna enjoy my
coffee a bit of a caffeine hit and get
back to work so it's now 7 p.m. I have
almost finished making dinner I have
made the chicken SOG recipe in the sour
mix I realize this whole video is very
thermomix heavy so far not sponsored by
Thermomix I'm just obsessed so I follow
the instructions on the machine again
it's basically a ton of spinach leaves
lots of different spices the chicken
itself actually cooks in the thumb makes
- it heats all the way up to just over a
hundred degrees so that is all pretty
much done and then we've got some brown
rice and quinoa currently on the hob and
some broccoli so a nice nutritious
dinner this was actually the first
recipe I ever did using the cookie on
the Thermomix and it is still my
favorite
it's Wednesday morning and I totally
forgot to vlog my breakfast I've fallen
out of the habit of vlogging since I
didn't really do a proper vlogmas
but you didn't miss too much and it'll
probably be the same breakfast every
single day this week I had a mother
crunch corn yogurt again I have a
problem with those I had a cup of green
tea the same as yesterday and then
Charlie made a juice yesterday as well
so we had a little bit of that each I
think he was beetroot because it was
very red lots of ginger maybe one Apple
probably some celery spinach
we basically chuck whatever we've got in
the fridge into the juicer and then we
put it in like little flasks so that we
can drink it for the next three or four
days because the juicer is a nightmare
to clean and then this morning I did
have a coffee I had it with oat milk
trying to reduce dairy where possible
I'm not sure if it's bad for me but I
see quite a lot of people reducing their
dairy and I figured I would try it so I
tried a new oat milk which was nice can
really taste a difference and then I had
one of my healthy little cheer Beauty
balls I call them I am about to write up
a blog post with the full recipe and
lots of nice pictures so I'll leave that
blog post linked down below so you can
bookmark that if you do want to make
them I highly recommend they are so
delicious obviously I didn't film
anything until now but I did take a
lovely cinematic clip of the sheer
beauty balls while I was photographing
them so I'll insert that now so you can
see how lovely they look and now it is
lunch time I was going to do something
different but actually I have a little
bit of these sauce left over from
yesterday when I did the leek pasta
sauce so I'm just gonna actually do the
healthy spinach pasta today and eat the
rest of the sauce with April and I think
charlie is gonna do his own thing he
doesn't really like my cooking even
though it's really delicious so that's
what I'm gonna do for lunch so this is
the pasta I'm going to be using it is
organic spinach Trot holy pasta so
hopefully a little bit healthier than
the usual look at that all green
are you sure you don't want to end on a
rapid X smoked salmon spinach and bean
sprouts I think you should do what I eat
in a week video is your really healthy
yeah lucidum you can finish up with a
Friday night hat comment down below
whose lunch you'd prefer my lovely
spinach pasta with Nehru Hansel or
Charlie's oh yeah but the thing is yours
after work yours is completely pointless
and virtually no protein in that he's
got good carbohydrates so that would be
good if you were gonna drop your
training yummy it's a good dinner this
have a lot of protein hello again
so I've just got back home after
spending the whole afternoon in the hair
salon I had my hair colored I went to
the Paul Edmondson on which is on
Brompton Road and I'm so happy with the
color it's kind of almost like a creamy
blond it's got some grey almost white
blond bits in it which I really really
love didn't film in the hair salon but I
did have a cappuccino while I was there
just to keep myself going so I was
working at the same time - and then I
popped one of the tables in a little
Tupperware in my handbag so I enjoyed
that as well and then as you will have
just seen I treated myself cannot resist
wasabi when I'm really hungry
I crave sweet chilli chicken from wasabi
and as I was walking see the bus stop to
get home I walked past I've got a waft
of the smell and I thought you know what
I'm gonna treat myself I don't have
anything prepared for dinner so that is
what I did I sat down and savored every
mouthful so at least I ate it mindfully
that was my excuse
yeah we've all gotta treat ourselves
every now and then so I'm back home now
I'm gonna do a little bit of work and go
to bed so see you in the morning
back from the gym not gonna lie that was
a very tough session that was our first
session back of the New Year with Adam
and I'm already aching the bits that we
filmed also were our second round so you
can tell we're already flagging by the
time we started filming home now and
absolutely starving I had a delivery
recently from a company called batch
organics they sent me these little pots
and inside it's all you need to make
yourself a smoothie or a breakfast bowl
lots of different flavors this one is
raspberry and coconut which I think I'm
gonna do now I've also got pineapple and
coconut smoothie and cacao and hazelnut
breakfast but I've got lots of different
ones to try you basically add in either
some coconut water or some oat milk
whatever you fancy blend it all up pop
the straw in and you're ready to go it's
a really really good idea I now have a
freezer full of them which I'm very
excited to go through throughout the
rest of the week so I'm gonna make
myself a nice healthy breakfast and get
down to work
I always forgot to show you what I'm
having for lunch today
it is another thermomix recipe I have
made the curried carrot ginger yeah
that's it curried carrot and ginger soup
and again it's one that I've not tried
before I actually have the size of the
recipe because I've just made it for
myself in April and the original recipe
was for four people so hopefully this is
going to nice and tasty and healthy as
well so the soup was a great success
very delicious just come into the
kitchen now it's nearly three o'clock
and I've made myself a cup of coffee
with Demerara sugar which hopefully a
little bit healthier and oat milk again
and then I'm going to devour two of the
last of my cheer balls they only lasted
four days because Charlie was helping
himself this week as well but I wanted
to quickly show you
Charlie's basically doing a
collaboration with Iceland all about how
fresh their frozen food is I'll let him
explain it I'm making a protein smoothie
Absolut I did not know they did this
it's really good it's not their own
brand I don't think that I can't I can't
say I've seen it anywhere else
so would you literally just stick this
in video for to lots of smoothies so I'm
going to stick it all in
how much was her two pounds I think
that's a pound it's mainly yeah very
good
it's not gonna be cheap is it when it's
this convenient but they do sell frozen
berries that is listen really stick out
Pro so there's a protein powder and some
chia seeds and never get out a protein
shake
whoa and then we've got my muscle
building vegan chili for this evening
which has got red kidney beans mixed
beans mushrooms onion garlic
awesome Thank You chef irons it is
dinner time now and another is here we
have been spoiled because Charlie cooked
us dinner this evening I will pass it
over to him to explain what we have for
our dinner so tell us what you've cooked
chef this is one of Jamie Oliver's
recipes and it's the five ingredients
book on what it's called but basically
it's a dish with five ingredients I've
added a few things because I want to do
but the main dish is a ribeye steak on
butter beans with wild mushrooms garlic
rosemary and red wine vinegar hmm that's
basically it and then I thought we'd add
some sweet potato because I know you
like that looks good pine nuts with
asparagus thank you darling good rating
from the love okay get-get-get fabulous
it's pretty healthy yeah Bon Appetit
it's a bit later on now and I've just
done a little bit of filming very
productive Saturday morning while
charlie was at the gym and now we are
heading out to brunch we're going to
meet some friends of ours at what is
probably our favorite breakfast place in
Clapham so I will show you what I'm
going to eat but I can already tell you
it's going to be a cappuccino and orange
juice and avocado on toast at home now
as predicted I did end up having an
avocado and toast and also some fried
potatoes as a bit of a side dish which
was absolutely delicious
charleen I've just been kind of sorting
and doing house stuff all day and I'm
now craving a bit of an afternoon energy
hit I was about to make myself a coffee
and then I remember that we've had these
in the freezer so this is another one
from batch organics another one of their
little handy freezer pots this one is
their espresso and tahini smoothie so
some very nice little bit healthier than
unusual coffee this one has got banana
courgette an espresso shot dates hemp
seeds cashews tahini maca cinnamon and
Himalayan pink sea salt in there so
she'd give me a nice afternoon energy
hips I'm gonna make that with some oat
milk and I'm going to enjoy that while I
do a little bit of kind of work but more
just research video planning so the fun
work and I also have this little rose
and pistachio cake that Charlie got me
yesterday from Gayle's so that's going
to be my afternoon snack
it's Saturday night which means it's
time for one thing and one thing only we
have our usual weekly streets also good
my mouth is already watering we have got
honest burger and chips onion rings oh
my goodness so I thought oh nice bag
with cheddar cheese Charlie what have
you got I'm the special guacamole and
her email and ketchup you got two
burgers I learnt in the John where's the
other one oh it's about time I get a pig
with a workout with our new thumb
starting leggings from sweaty and now
breakfast is being cooked up and
something healthy nutritious breakfast I
just ordered a latte
No

forgot to finish my what I eat in a week
vlog not sure if you'll have heard too
much what I was saying earlier but we
had a workout with sweaty Betty to put
to the test our new leggings which are
there but sculpting ones which was
really really good fun at workout and
then we had a very healthy nutritious
breakfast after that I had a turmeric
latte and an avocado with chili seeds on
toast which was absolutely perfect
then Charlie and I went to do a bit of
shooting and then photo shooting not gun
shooting and then we went to Charlie's
cousin's house and his wife and they
have the most amazing apartment which is
directly on old Compton Street over
cross road from Ed's diner so amazing
location and they cooked us a roast
dinner so end of the week on a very very
good note we had roast chicken and all
the trimmings it was absolutely
delicious so a week of ups and downs
some really healthy bits some nice
little treats as well but that's what
it's all about so I hope you enjoyed
this what I eat in a week video do you
