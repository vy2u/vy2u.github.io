today I thought I would start a was I
eat this week slash my weekly workouts I
thought that seeing as we've just got
back from our trip to France and we did
over indulge a little bit didn't do too
much working out while we're out there
this would be a really good way to
motivate me into thing a little bit
healthier and get a little bit more fit
so kind of a double whammy with this
vlog I actually saw Susie from hella
October she did the combination of what
I eat this week and workout videos of
the great idea so thanks Susie the
inspiration I am starting the strawberry
round 11 a.m. or that midday on Monday
so this morning I've obviously not
started myself I made myself a coffee I
had one of my mullah Crunch corners that
I always do and I'm about to make myself
some lunch which is actually quite
boring lunch we don't have anything in
the house the moments as soon as you got
back only yesterday but this afternoon
I'm going to have a look through some of
my cookbooks and prepare some meals for
the rest of the week or plan some meal
to the rest of the week so I'll let you
know what I'm going to order Angus it if
you want to order the same and cook from
cooking then feel free but yeah sampling
some lunch it's going to be a Peru silly
which is actually something that I got
after being recommended it from Ella
from Coco's tea party she has been
raving about this PG silly so that's
what I'm going to have I'm going to have
that maybe just with some parmesan make
it a little bit more exciting and as you
may be able to see I am in my workout
gear I did actually have a little home
workout this morning I saw that Carly
Rowena had uploaded a seven-day at-home
workout so I did day one of that first
thing this morning and feels really good
to actually burn some calories and get
the heart rate up at home so we're
definitely going to continue doing that
for the rest a week but yeah I'm
starving so let's go downstairs and mix
a month
okay they've got the pasta cooking it's
actually not made purely of P I started
by these pastors that are like hundred
percent edamame or a hundred cents
spirulina but this one is made from pea
flour but tilters is one of your five a
day that's a good start and also things
just boiled the castle gonna top up my
tea I've been you basically got this
cupboard filled with loads of different
kinds of tea bags at the moment I'm
drinking a hooker or cuca and plenty and
what I normally do is I'm really bad I
never finish a cup of tea so this one's
about passable but what I'll do is heat
up the kettle and make myself another
cup of tea from the same tea bag often
we do that about five times day so
getting as much used out of that tea bag
as possible this one serves as a
cleansing one so yeah we'll see I'm not
a fan of any of these like tea detoxes
but this one tastes good
so I just went into the fridge to grab
from Parma bans so it's with my pasta
and then I remember that we've got this
so this is pesto genovese and we pick
this up in the market in Provence where
we were last week and it was so funny
because trying are it's like walking
past try not to get distracted and this
guy was the best salesmen ever he
dragged us over made us try it and we
fell another soon to try it and then
told us how the basil leaves have been
grown by the waters they've sort of
oxygen and blah blah blah
physical selfish so we ended up buying
them I'm going to put a little bit in
the minecrafter to make it a little bit
more exciting and yeah
Bubbe
okay so I wasn't the hugest fan of that
piece is Billy I think I'm trying the
old food one actually recommended
instead of the centuries what as you can
see I didn't even really eat like half
of it it is an amazing limit weird about
it but the pesto is pretty nice it
doesn't even try that with malefactor I
am going to be reading all here and have
another yogurt
sorry about the washing machine going on
and it's a little bit hungry but then
I'm going to make some of my energy
balls because inside have some need now
that is what I would smack on the other
smacks people in the house are from
slaughter men and boxing and it's so
unhealthy so yeah kinda happy yoga and
neither make some energy balls which is
I haven't seen before from work I'll
leave the links the video I make them
down below but then I'll have healthy
snacks with for a few weeks but for now
time for another job it finished my job
and back in the kitchen now I can
Institute allows but whenever I finish a
yogurt these little babies always get to
polish off whatever money leave is not
normally very much but um you really
enjoy licking the yogurt pot so good
don't he has to retreat the day or evens
up a little bit view of it around in
lush do you feel when W the Dickens has
had his dessert and I am now going to
make my energy balls so behind me here
this is where we keep the cookbooks that
we use the most I've got from Madeline
Shaw ones I've got minis real food
I also got some at least Albert I think
it's some devel one open your book as
well I can get to lose our skin that has
the energy ball recipe in it that I
wanted to try I have my own kind of
recipe I just shoving everything but I'm
going to see what is they'll recommend
to add some more skin lifting
ingredients to my energy balls I didn't
even realize before listening to Lillian
Anna's podcast at home with Liz l and
that she has I think over like 25
cookbooks or something or recipe books
which is incredible obviously Liz l is
most well known for her skincare but
she's very much a well-being goddess so
yeah definitely a good one to take
advice from I'm sure she had Beautiful's
in here let's have a look
yep here we go these are her beauty
bombs so she recommends pumpkin seeds
sunflower seeds sesame seeds cherries
cranberries blah blah blah okay not sure
if I've got all of that but let's have a
little look in the cupboards and see
what we can do
all right so I don't have everything in
Lavelle's recipe I don't have body
flakes but I've got this selection what
I'm also going to do is go into our
healthy cupboard because we really keep
like you know this kind of thing I'm
going to put in a few good guru good
oats and berries just to thicken them up
a little bit and what I really like is
or I put in some bulb up as well Vanessa
poke announces huh I've also got out
some coconut oil this just helps to bind
everything together I'm sure this all
should have that in her recipe and the
really nice does but I always put in
some coconut oil just to make everything
stick together and then I've got some
new cacao powder this is from rainforest
foods looks like Charlie's already had a
go at this
yeah just make them taste nice and
chocolaty so you get a bit of a sweet
kick as well also while I've got you
just had a knock on the door it was a
delivery from Viktor and Rolf how
amazing is this useful middle and full
bunch of flowers that is absolutely
stunning
I need to put those in a little bar pop
them in the sink for now and what is
this what is this
OhLaLa welcome to our world of
fragrances from Viktor and Rolf this is
probably my favorite perfume of all time
it is fiction royal flower bottom I just
absolutely love this perfume so much and
then we've got a body cream I'm actually
using this in the bathroom at the moment
it's just so heavenly and then we've got
a perfume shell oil and the body lotion
totally spoiled by Viktor &amp;amp; Rolf so
thank you for those lovely folks topping
me up I think this is to launch their
new Instagram which is victory north and
score fragrances so definitely give that
a follow if you're also a huge fan of
the brand I'm sure will be lots of pink
of floral wonderfulness
so in Liz's recipe for her beauty balm
she actually recommends putting some of
the seeds in a frying pan which I've not
done before but if that's what this says
that's what I'm going to do so I've got
pumpkin seeds sunflower seeds and sesame
seeds into a frying pan over medium heat
three to four minutes so I'm going to do
that while the heating up I'm going to
take the stones out all four pips of
those stones after my dates and then
stick everything in the film mix then it
all up and make it a little
okay I'm not going to my views I'm not
going to be my finest beauty balls
I think these seed slight burning at the
beginning has given them a Berber tinge
but I'm studying happy with how they are
now time in an hour
lay the mixture out of the baking tray
put it in the fridge and then in an hour
or so I'll cut it up into little
beautiful as you saw I decided to go for
all instead of Bath's and just in a
little bit prettier but they do take tad
longer so now I'm going to put these in
the fridge and the coconut oil and cocoa
should hopefully Harden so there is a
little more solid when I eat them they
should be ready in a couple of hours
just before I head out I'm actually
going out for an Italian tonight so yeah
not the most healthy starts a week but a
tasty one
okay cause parts for now and I'm
starting to get afternoon munchies I'm
going to take my energy balls out the
fridge I've got some Tupperware so I'm
going to put them into which will just
make them a little bit more long-lasting
in fact filled from the air so yeah I'm
going to have a little energy ball let's
see how we came out they're frozen you
can still taste the burnt seeds but
notice good some have one of those from
a coffee you go to and that should help
you through my mid-afternoon munchies so
while I'm enjoying my afternoon coffee
break from the emails I'm going to go
through our cookbooks and I'm going to
make an online order and order the
basics China I don't have a car at the
moment so online ordering is just a lot
easier for a lot of these books I have
put post-it notes in my favorite recipes
but yeah just going to have a flick
through and decide what we're going to
eat this week and order some ingredients
so Italian food of what will happen good
morning so I've gotten some serious
calories to burn off this morning I
overindulged last night because the food
was so good who went to ask Italian and
I had provider I had that little pizza
bread and more burrata and charcuterie
and pizza and more pizza
so yes going to be a serious gym session
this morning try and burn as many
calories as possible this is my gym
outfit of the day pretty much everything
I'm going to wear it sweaty Becky but
we'll leave it all linked down below big
stretch of edgy San Jose over here but
yeah so this morning I woke up nice and
early glass of water which I need to
finish and charlie of Charlie makes
juices for most mornings he makes them
in bulk and then put some in the fridge
I know you meant to drink them fresh
straight away but we seal them in the
fridge and they still taste good so this
morning is this concoction which I
believe is beetroot celery one apple
between four juices and probably some
spinach he basically just shoving
whatever veggies got in the fridge for
always try and put in a little bit of
beetroot and then some ginger yeah I'll
ask him when he next does one and I can
show you what he puts in them but it's a
good way to get some nutrients start the
day so yep gonna hence the gym now do a
proper workout I'm also going to do the
moves in Carly's seven-day workout and
yes I see
ah
ah back from the gym after a short but
quite intense workout I didn't want to
spend too long now this morning but feel
like I did a good session so now I'm
going to make myself a bit of a post gym
smoothie I don't have half the
ingredients that I would like to have so
I'm just going to pull together and
there's stuff in the cupboards and hope
that it tastes decent luckily we have
got some almond drink so this is what
I'm going to use like the main part of
it and then I found that we have some
frozen blueberries in the freezer so
that should add some antioxidants bit of
flavor hopefully the online food
shopping is coming tomorrow so I'll have
much better some goodies out of then I
normally always put a banana in but the
shops across the road don't sell bananas
they sell everything else they're not
bananas which is ridiculous and I'm also
going to put in some super elixir we've
had this in the cupboard for a while and
I think it needs finishing and it's
really good I'm going to put some about
in chia seeds and then also I am put in
because this makes it Riesling and the
good guru good oats and berries I talked
about this and that brand as a whole in
my healthy morning routine which I think
it's our most viewed video ever so I'll
leave that link up here if you can go
and check that out but yeah still a huge
fan of this and the oats obviously keep
your in full and has a little bit of
protein in there so great for after
workout I'm going to go to my healthy
cupboard and maybe I'll put in some of
this flax fiber it literally just me
making potions I don't really know I'm
doing when I do this and and then this
is what I put in the energy balls
yesterday from the old yard remedies
they have some really nice superfoods
this is our organic very complex should
make it taste a bit nicer so that's one
unit so in a blender and you closed it
teeth alright
when you
I'm actually pretty impressed with how
the tape despite the random concoction
ingredients it's actually pretty good if
you like making smoothies highly highly
highly recommend getting metal tools
like this we used to go through so many
paper straws and I was thinking not only
is a tree bad for the environment but
expensive and and also they're all mushy
like if you don't treat your smoothie
straightaway which I don't so top tip
get a metal straw but yeah so this is
what I put in just nails enough of this
and then I put a glass in the fridge for
April and there's enough in there left
the Charlie as well so I'll whip that up
when he gets cracks in the gym he stayed
a little bit longer than me but I'll
enjoy that I'm going to make myself a
coffee when I finish that we have got
let's see as you may know from Instagram
story-based big fan of Nespresso and we
have the DeLonghi machine which is fab
these little capsules are actually for
iced coffee which Charlie is a huge fan
of I prefer it hot and I'm not really
too picky when it comes to capsules I
just love all of them this morning I'm
going to be using a kazar which is dark
maybe I think this is one of the quite
strong and mystic one one of my favorite
from Nespresso was when they did their
exploration range they had some which
they'd got the coffee beans from Kenya
and then some from Laos and they were so
so tasty that hopefully be asked at my
hands on a few more of those they are
limited edition though so yeah you keep
lookout but that will keep me going it
throughout the rest of the morning and
I'll catch up with you guys at lunch so
almost forgot that I was filming a were
playing in a week video but since I last
spoke to you I've had a coffee and other
coffee a couple of energy balls and now
I'm making
yeah we're fortunately for my coffee
Charlie keeps reminding me and now I'm
cooking macaroni cheese don't tell
anyone but just her craving and we only
pretty much have pasta and cheese in the
house that what's the girls opposed to
do what a healthy version with
whole-wheat recently I put a little bit
extra mustard in the white sauce courage
brewing April just wanna cross the road

then we're going to enjoy our first
macaroni cheese of the autumn season
alrighty so demolish my half the mac and

out with me tonight this has not turned
out - you're very well organized vlog
apples so I do apologize but as you just
saw I did film a few clips on my iPhone
of our Friday evening treat it is a bit
of a tradition that Charlie and I
haven't undergone Fridays because
there's one five minutes from where we
live and we both absolutely love a good
burger and this week they had a special
which was the California burger it was
like a mustard fried beef patty with
American cheese and obviously I had the
regime sausage chips and the onion rings
and and he was actually the best burger
I've ever had which is saying a lot and
had a lot of burgers and I had a
vegetable suits for lunch which I also
forgot to film I'm so sorry the floggers
was torn down okay finishing the vlog on
my phone because my camera battery just
died I feel like this vlog was just not
meant to be but I think I was in the
middle of telling you about my lunch
which was a vegetable soup that Charlie
made for myself and April and finish off
this week which was meant to be a
healthy week we're having our usual
snacks and for me that is Milky Way
stars and scheduled and an arrow bar
just for good measure
and I'll probably have a GTO or
something so not terribly exciting but
that's our Friday night treats we were
going to have a barbecue tonight but
times changed so yeah I hope you guys
