going to be my may favorites you know
the drill by now these are all the
products that I have been loving over
the past few weeks so in this video I'm
going to be talking about a few hair
favorites and I've been getting quite a
lot of questions about my hair
especially over on Instagram and then as
always is going to be beauty favorites
and fashion favorites without really
meaning to this beauty section has got
quite a clean Beauty theme to it a lot
of these products are natural or organic
and I have to say I have been trying to
move my beauty routine in that direction
and so far I have been very impressed
with the results I would say this past
month my skin has been the best it's
been in pretty much ever and I have been
using a lot of natural products some
other products I mentioned in last
month's favorites video from a brand
called herbivore and then I'll share
with you a few of the other pieces in
today's video so firstly I mentioned in
a couple of vlogs that I've been having
some quite uneven pigmentation on my
forehead this is something that I've
always suffered from and it gets a lot
worse when I have a natural tan because
certain areas of my skin get a lot more
tan than other areas I also used to have
it on my chest but that seems to have
gone as I've grown up but basically I've
been using the trilogy certified organic
rose hip oil on my forehead
I've been popping a couple of drops of
this into my hands and using it as face
oil in the mornings and evenings and to
be honest the pigmentation of my
forehead seems to be pretty much gone
now which is great because it's summer
I'm going to be naturally picking up a
bit of a tan that's so fabulous that the
pigmentation is no longer such a problem
this I would say is like the organic
version of bio oil rose hip oil is
really great at regenerating the skin
helping the skin heal itself and it's
also got lots of omegas and fatty acids
in there so it's very nourishing for the
skin so even if you don't have
pigmentation you just want to calm the
skin I would highly highly recommend
this and you can pick up this and lots
of other organic clean beauty products
in Holland embarrass so very very handy
to get your hands on I've also been
really conscious that I don't want to be
putting a lot of chemicals on my lips
because then you are ingesting and loads
of chemicals so I've been looking for
more natural lip balms
I have been using the Llano lips 101
Point mint and multiband this as you can
probably guess from the name can be used
for lots of different things what I
usually do is apply it's quite thick
bomb I apply it to my lips first and
then anything that's left on my fingers
I rub into my cuticles and if I do have
dry elbows then I will also pop it there
so very multitasking and 100% natural
it's obviously super hydrating for the
lips and I find that it's a really great
lip balm to pop on before your lipstick
although because it's quite thick I
would say the consistency is similar to
a car Mac so you can really feel it on
the lips for quite a long time I do blot
it off before applying my lipstick so
this morning for example I had this on
my lips for about 20 minutes I get up I
cleanse my skin I put my lip balm on I
do all of my makeup then I go and brush
my teeth a blot off my lip balm and then
put on the lipstick so great for pre
lipstick lip prep as well I'm going to
be talking about my favorite body fake
tan in a few moments but for my face I
have been using this new one from Askia
this is called their adaptive tan mist
this is also 100% natural which is
amazing again no chemicals getting on
the face of this and it's called an
adaptive tan mist and it really does
adapt to your specific skin tone so the
tan is incredibly natural and it also
gradually builds day after day this has
got white tea it's got vitamins it's got
pea peptides monks pepper loads are very
nourishing ingredients so it's really
good for the skin helps the skin to
maintain its radiance and its healthy
glow while tanning as well so this is
something very new to my beauty routine
but if like me you find that your face
gets paler much quicker than your body
it's really easy to just mist on before
you start your makeup routine and then
the last step in my makeup routine and
my makeup has got a little bit lighter
than previously because my skin's been
so good I've been using a lot more
tinted moisturizers of course bare
minerals complexion rescue which you
guys know that I absolutely adore I mean
a lot lighter on the products I'm
putting on my face but what I have been
that loving as a final step has been
this I'm already onto bottle number two
this is the rose hibiscus coconut water
hydrating face mist from her before I
mentioned her before products loads and
last month's favorites still using all
the ones I mentioned there the pink
curve moisturizer the jasmine tea face
mist toner and the Jade roller but this
is a new addition to the routine and I
use this as the very very last step when
all my makeup is done and I just want a
quick refresh then I just spritz this
all over the face it is coconut water so
very hydrating you could spritz your
face in the afternoon in the evenings
especially on days like today when it's
really warm this is just the most
refreshing lovely hydrating thing to do
also if you have lash extensions like me
it does not contain any oils that's not
going to dislodge your lashes
moving on to body the tan that I've been
using to keep myself super bronzed since
I've got back from my trips is no
surprises the Beatty Liberata phenomenal
two to three week tan I have been using
this for oh my gosh four or five years I
absolutely love it and this makes me go
to the darkest so I'm now using the dark
one any other time of year I use the
medium one but when I have a natural tan
and I applied this maybe a week ago so
this is like a week old dark tan and I
still think I'm super bronzed it looks
super super natural Vita Liberata again
is an organic friend so it's not like so
many fake tans where you are pretty so
many chemicals in your body I did a
video I think probably about a year ago
which was my fake tan routine and I do
get asked a lot of questions about how I
get my tans look so natural to be honest
my tanning routine hasn't actually
changed that much so I will leave that
video link down below it's all my tips
on how to do a flawless fake tan using
at the Beauty Liberata phenomenal time
as you can guess by the name it is super
long lasting two to three weeks I would
say that I usually reapply this on day
seven or eight just to make myself super
dark again and this of all the fake tans
like ever tried who makes me the darkest
so if you really want to go super super
Brown then give this a go alright moving
on to hair the first product that I use
in my daily or every other day shower
routine is this again I'm on to bottle
number two just repurchase this it is
the Tropic terrifying hair wash this is
made naturally with aloe vera juice a
booster extract and coconut derived
cleansers it's called a clarifying hair
wash and I would say it does exactly
that I got to a time maybe three weeks
ago when my hair
felt so heavy so full of product I felt
like I'd always not washed out my
shampoo and conditioner properly and
then I started using this and it's
totally changed the way that my hair
feels after shampooing and conditioning
now it's just super light I feel like
it's just really bouncy glossy my hair
feels healthy it feels super super light
not fluffy and frizzy just exactly how
you want your hair to feel so I've been
really enjoying using this it also
smells absolutely amazing I alternate my
washes with the matching conditioner
from this range with this new range from
a red can this is their new blondish
range and I have this to thank for
keeping my hair the color and the tone
that I want it to be when I first had my
hair colored I had the most beautiful
highlights but they started to go a
little bit yellowy so then I started to
use the shampoo that's this one and from
the first use it absolutely
revolutionized my hair color you know
when you're straight out the
hairdresser's and they've toned it so
fabulously it looks really gorgeous as
she almost gray blonde that's what I
really really wanted and that is exactly
what this gives me it's called a toning
and strengthening system for blondes and
what makes us different from any other
toning shampoos and conditioners dyv use
is it actually really nourishes the hair
as well as altering the color so I don't
know about you but previously when I've
used toning shampoos my hair's felt so
dry and brittle afterwards not with this
it actually makes my hair feel nourished
and I'm just so pleased with a condition
and color of my hair at the moment this
shampoo that I did last night was
actually using the Tropic products so
it's not as toned as it could be if I
have a photo shoot the next day I will
use this the night before I will insert
some clips here of my hair the day after
I'd use this and you can see it's a
really lovely almost gray ashy blonde
and that is exactly the color I wanted
that was as a result of leaving this
shampoo in my hair for a good three
minutes while I exfoliated my body then
I towel dried my hair and left the
conditioner in for five minutes so I
really did go for it and give this the
benefit of the doubt and I was so so
pleased with the results so highly
highly recommend this sticking with the
hair theme and I know I've definitely
mentioned this in a favorites video
before but while we're talking about
hair I have to give another shout-out to
my pure ology perfect for platinum hair
treatment if you have got color
hair like mine and you find it maybe how
to comb through or you want to speed up
your blow-dry time or you want to make
sure that your hair doesn't go frizzy
you want to heat protect this has so so
many uses everything I've listed and I
think this has like 17 different
benefits it's called a miracle filler
fills gaps in pores fragile hair leaving
high lifted or highlighted blondes soft
and shiny again so it has long-term
benefits as well as those short-term
benefits I mentioned previously I will
repurchase this before the rest of my
life it's probably the best product that
I've ever discovered for my hair so
another one that I would highly highly
recommend if you have blonde colored
have it's also a hundred percent vegan
ingredients and it has anti fade so if
you are spending a lot of money getting
your hair colored this will also help
protect your color and make your blonde
look fresh for even longer so so many
benefits just cannot rave about this
enough okay last two Beach products this
is another one that I've been using the
shower and it's from sanctuary spa green
lemon and orange blossom wet skin
moisture miracle when I first use this I
actually used it wrong I used it as like
a body conditioner in the shower to
shave with but what you're actually
meant to do is finish your shower
completely stand in your shower absolute
soaking wet and then apply this like a
body lotion so you rub it in exactly
like you would a body lotion when your
towel dried but actually you're soaking
wet which means your skin is still very
absorbent can absorb all the
moisturizing benefits from this then you
step out the shower and towel try it as
normal you don't have to apply a normal
body lotion afterwards so it's really
really great
before if you're in a rush perhaps you
might want to put this in your gym bag
if you like to shower before work at the
gym because then you didn't have to
stand around waiting for your body
lotion to dry it's non greasy it smells
absolutely amazing it makes your morning
routine a whole lot faster and it leaves
your skin so so moisturized I also would
say this is a great product to use if
you are doing a cycle or fake tanning
because it's so important to keep the
skin hydrated but you don't want too
many products sitting on the skin which
could make your tan fade a bit faster
final beauty product is the body mist
from the Estee Lauder bronze goddess
range I feel like it's at this time of
year every year that I start to
rediscover my love for bronze goddess I
think it is the ultimate summer
fragrance and this year they've released
a cooling of body spray so yes it is
cooling it's very refreshing if you put
it over
limbs on a hot day across your chest so
so lovely but it has a very intense
smell of France goddess I actually would
say that I have been preferring
spritzing my whole body with this to
using the fragrance I find that it's
just so quick and you can kind of cover
more of your clothing and body with this
instead of the perfume which is more
direct in certain areas and it's a great
thing to add to your scent collection if
you are already a fan of France goddess
which I most definitely am alright so
we're going to now move on to some
fashion favorites I feel like this will
not be a surprise if you've been
watching a my Instagram stories my
lookbook things like that it is this
beautiful address from Rhys now this I
feel like is the most me piece that
could ever exist it is a very very light
pink dress so beautiful that links it
comes to just above the knees so it's
not too short not too long
gorgeous gorgeous pleated material super
soft lightweight material and then the
sleeves are fluted so just many many
design details that I absolutely adore
beautiful lightweight fabrics are great
for this time of year if you want to
look a little bit more smart four days
of meetings things like that then this
is just absolutely dreamy I have been
styling it most recently with my
beautiful mulberry seating bag which I
would say is another favorite this month
this bag is such a lovely size I really
like holding it by its handle I think it
looks so so chic it also does have a
shoulder strap which I don't use quite
so much but this bag just fits all of my
essentials inside and more and I think
this color combination together is
absolutely perfect on those slightly
chillier spring days I have been wearing
this coat this is my faux leather coat
from Topshop and it was very affordable
for such a well-made and well structured
piece of outerwear I think this could so
easily be a super expensive designer
piece it certainly gives your outfit a
very luxurious finish if you wear it
again with a crossbody bag or a little
handheld bag like the Mara Seaton it's
just absolutely beautiful
I like to wear this either over my
shoulders or as a normal coat it also
comes the waist belt which to be honest
I haven't been wearing quite so much but
it's just a perfect coat in a light
color so great for us someone's in
wardrobe that does keep you warm on
those chilly air spring mornings and
this has been my go-to coat for the last
month I would say
under 100 pounds so highly highly
recommend this one as well I've been
wearing a lot of clots and light colored
trousers recently I feel like they just
work for going to work going to meetings
going to events and they're really good
for being smart and casual at the same
time kind of like a midi skirt which I
still absolutely love my midi skirts but
a couple of pairs of light colored
trousers I've been wearing lately sorry
about the noise in the background
Dickens is making his bed under the
chair and he's been doing it for the
last 10 minutes this pair of trousers is
from Dickey is from ASOS they were super
super affordable and I just absolutely
adore them really lovely lightweight
material can you Dickie they have got
this beautiful pleated detail across the
front so they fit the body really
beautifully around the waist and around
the hips the perfect height as well they
finished just above the ankles so
perfect for showcasing your shoes and
this kind of trials are can be paired
with loads of different tops throughout
the summer either a plain white t-shirt
in fact I styled these with this
beautiful silk cami top from Reese in my
spring everyday out this video thank you
very much for all your lovely comments
on that so this has been a bit of a
dream combination lately if you want a
little bit more fabric on your body this
is something that I only just got from a
sauce but again this would be a really
really beautiful combination a little
bit more free-flowing and boho style or
you could wear them with something a lot
more patterned you guys may remember
this top very Zimmerman asked top from
my Zara haul but the point I'm trying to
make is that light colored culottes and
light weight rouses are just a very very
versatile I also wanted to include in my
favourites my River Island ones with the
lace around the bottom but they are
currently in the wash it's I'll insert a
video clip of me wearing them here I've
been wearing these so much this month
but it was at the Chelsea Flower Show
that I wore them actually I think with
this top that I just thought they are so
so beautiful and so many people came up
and asked me about them I think being at
the Chelsea Flower Show everyone is just
attracted to anything floral anything
pretty and they were such a hit
I had just so many questions and people
even taking photos of them to like show
their daughters so yes they're a huge
hit this month and I'll be wearing them
throughout the summer no doubt I am a
huge huge fan of broderie anglaise so
the collection
in sorrow at the moment has got me
absolutely smitten if you didn't catch
my czar at all and I'll leave it linked
up on the screen and also down below you
definitely need to check that out if you
have a similar style to me because Zara
right now is absolutely a dream I picked
up this beautiful skirt it is a broderie
anglaise skirt with this gorgeous I
would say this comes up to just below
the knees so very very elegant and
feminine length I love the bottom of
this sculpt bottom and you can see
through the little Daisy broderie
anglaise air just so so pretty my
favorite way to style this skirt has
been with this beautiful silk top from
Reese there's a bit of a running theme I
just love these kind of basic pieces
from Reese every spring summer I invest
in a couple so you've seen this one my
cami as well these are like my wardrobe
basics they just go with so many
different things I think that it makes
putting an outfit together so much
easier if you have a few really good
quality pieces like this in your
wardrobe sorry that this has got a
little bit of makeup mark on it I am
actually just about to put this in the
wash
I wasn't actually planning on including
this in my favorites but actually it
most definitely deserves a place because
it's so gorgeous beautiful light pink
silk it's got this Peter detail down the
back gorgeous neckline I love that it's
got this double layer of fabric here and
it really helps to frame any pretty
necklaces you might have on that day I
also find the color super super tan
enhancing these two pieces together has
just been at the perfect spring everyday
outfit I've already mentioned my
Mulberry Seton so I'm just going to
finish with a couple more accessories
can't remember if I included these in
last month's favorites if I did I'm
sorry I don't still obsessed with them
these aren't my beautiful little Tory
Burch sandals I have been wearing these
so much more because I finally find them
comfortable when I first got them I
found them a little bit sore to walk in
I don't wear them on days and I know I'm
doing a lot of walking but they are the
perfect finishing touch to my clots with
jeans with midi skirts I just absolutely
adore them beautiful design with the
pearls on the top as well very very
pretty
and then the shoes that I actually
wanted to finish on my Valentino
Rockstar sandals which I have been
wearing absolutely loads this month
however because I wore them for pretty
much 48 hours straight in can when I
went to can win an espresso for the Film
Festival this month the sole of them all
the bit that the foot
touches as opposed to that the ground
touches has become a little bit like
crinkled so I've actually sent them back
to Valentino to be repaired so I thought
I would just give these a shout out
firstly to remind me to mention the
original Valentino's which I will insert
a clip of here so you know the ones that
I'm talking about if you like to invest
in Footwear I would highly recommend
this pair of shoes it's so comfortable
they look beautiful and they work with
so many things but if that's not your
budget I have also been wearing my
misguided oops
ever since I took my Valentina's to be
repaired I have been having a Valentino
sandals shaped hole of missing in my
wardrobe so I've been reaching for these
a lot ever since and they are great
quality they look beautiful almost as
beautiful as the Valentino's and again a
really comfy and a great heel height for
wearing all day long so there's
everything that I have been loving
