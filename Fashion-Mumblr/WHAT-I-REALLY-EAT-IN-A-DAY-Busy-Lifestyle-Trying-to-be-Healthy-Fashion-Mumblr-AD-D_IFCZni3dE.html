daily vlog kind of what I eat in a day
video I'm going to be doing some fun
things today and it's just generally
quite a busy vlog a day so I thought I
would give a little bit of a spin to
this video and try and show you how I
eat on a super busy day so obviously
trying to keep myself energized trying
to be nutritious where possible and
fitting that into a really busy
lifestyles I think that would probably
be something that a lot of you guys
maybe not struggle with but think about
so yeah I thought that's low do today I
am working with hellofresh for this
video and they for me are a perfect
example of fitting a really nice tasty
nutritious meal into a busy lifestyle
cuz obviously you get the box delivered
to your house as I listed on Sunday and
then it comes with all the ingredients
that you need for your meal in the
evening or lunch whenever you decide to
have it if you want to have burgers for
breakfast that's fine by me and I
usually have it as my main evening meal
so yeah we got three meals delivered on
Sunday I'm going to be making one of
those for you tonight yesterday we were
craving some comfort food it was a very
gray rainy miserable day so I actually
used the recipe from the hellofresh box
to make some burgers I will insert the
clips of that now
so I have a little think back and I feel
like it's been over a year since I last
cooked a meal for Charlie
so tonight I'm making up for it I'm
using the burger recipe is officially
called the eat it's officially called
the starch bar bag burgers basically I
feel like I'm getting an easy option
tonight because as you know with hella
fresh all the ingredients are kind of
pre meted out you don't need to measure
anything everything comes in the water
bag so a very very easy way to make
dinner it's almost ready so let's see
then this is just to get
so a very successful start with our head
of fresh delivery delicious burgers they
were absolutely scrumptious charlie is
very much a burger connoisseur he likes
to think and he was amazed and so as I
actually how easy it was to make so
great start I'm gonna be making a meal
tonight as I mentioned still a bit more
healthy it's so great after a pity date
in town and I also have a discount code
from hellofresh
which they very kindly sorted out for
you guys I will leave the discount code
and all the information down in the
description box below so check that out
for more information and to get money
off your first box okay so today I am
heading into town first thing it's about
eight o'clock in the morning right now
usually by now I would have had a mullah
crunch corner yogurts which you'll know
if you've watched any of my previous
what I eat in a day videos because I
literally have them all the time they
are my weakness but I ran out last one
last night and I'm very sad about that
so I'm going to find something on my way
into town probably gonna stop into
saying to be local and get a smoothie or
something or if I find myself walking
past that amazing frozen acai smoothie
place on Argyle Street which I might do
I'll pick up one of those because they
are delicious then I've got lunch and I
try to organize my lunch meetings in
healthy places today I am going to
Daylesford I'm meeting the Topshop team
so real excited about that Delta dorsi
being really nice and organic fresh
produce from the countryside so it's
gonna be a nice lunch and then the hello
fresh box for dinner so without further
ado let's get going I forgot to mention
earlier but I did start the day as I do
most days with a lemon green tea from
Clipper and I just find them really good
for not only being nice and warming and
comforting but it's quite a light
refreshing green tea nice for these
slightly warmer months but I will still
drink it as we go into autumn I've got a
little bit left which I'm gonna down now
before heading out the door
hours later and you may have noticed
I've changed outfits and that's because
I was just shooting a few outfit clips
in the park and then ended up getting
changed to shoot even more so wearing
something different what i was wearing
earlier it's not been a terribly
successful day eating wise so i just
picked up this little tropical mix from
Marks &amp;amp; Spencer it had like apricot
pineapple and coconut flakes in it
that's so far it's all that I've eaten
today
not terribly healthy or nutritious but
I'm on my way now to obeying for a
meeting I will probably grab a coffee
and something to snack upon before my
healthy lunch I definitely would not
recommend normally going this long
without food especially on a busy day
but something like this it says high in
fiber one of your five a day so
hopefully this will keep my energy up
just while I dash aphromoo meeting
all right so finished a lovely lunch at
Dale's verge I'm talking about quietly
because I'm in public and it's
embarrassing and now have picked up an
acai smoothie I think I was talking
about these earlier but yeah I just read
the sign about the 10 health benefits of
acai
so hoping it's going to energize me to
the afternoon I'm going to catch up with
you guys a bit more when I'm at home and
I can talked about getting a lot to the
stairs and straight
okay back home again and apologies for
that last clip because I feel like it
probably didn't make any sense I was
walking down a little side street
between Argyle Street and Regent Street
and trying to vlog in front of crowds of
people loads of builders and I was
getting some very strange looks but what
I was trying to explain was so I had a
coffee had a cappuccino as you saw a toe
bein for my first meeting and then my
next meeting was at Daylesford and as I
mentioned at the beginning of the video
I tried to do my lunch meetings and
healthy places so I don't end up just
getting burger and macaroni cheese and
chips and then feeling like a slob for
the rest the afternoon and so try and go
places where it's a little bit more
nutritious I did end up getting a fairly
comforting meal I had an autumnal
risotto it was obviously risotto rice
and butternut squash that was honey
olive tapenade in there so very very
tasty probably not the healthiest but
I'm all about that balance and then we
did have a triple mac and cheese to
share between the three of us but I
probably only had about three spoonfuls
so it's very tasty but not too naughty
and I also had mostly lots of water and
a tea with it as well I think it's
called be energized tea and I was like
lemongrass ginger green tea infusions
that was very tasty
and apparently helps the digestive
system so that's great
then I had one more meeting and then
already I was packaged again so I did go
by that acai stool that I mentioned
again earlier in the video which is on
Argyle Street so I had a sunrise
smoothie which is like acai blueberries
raspberries and oats very filling very
tasty and there are just so many health
benefits to our size so it was a nice
healthy afternoon snack come upstairs
now and I'm going to film a video
feeling quite energised to film
something and the lighting is quite good
too still this afternoon so I'll
probably make myself a another cup of
green tea just to keep myself going and
then I'll cook with you guys later on
this afternoon so I'll catch up with you
in a few hours and I'll probably wearing
something different again so prepare
yourself outfit change number three
varieties so we are on to my third
outfit of the day and I honestly did
intend for this to be a lovely
nutritious what I eat in the day but I'm
not one to pull the wool over your eyes
so yes there is a doughnut resting on my
dream alone candle in the background
here charlie very kindly he bought some
doughnuts home so I'm just going to
enjoy my strawberry iced hundreds and
thousands doughnut with a cup of tea I
was putting it up there to hide it from
the dogs in case you were wondering why
it was on the mantelpiece but ya gonna
have my donut with my cup of tea as my
4:00 p.m. energy boost are gonna try and
crack on with a load of emails get lots
of that Don photo editing video editing
and then I'll catch up with you guys at
dinner time mommy where's our donut
getting even ooh my sweet boy but duck
fit for you you got to fill it for my
poopy
we like donut - mommy I know you do but
copies of gluten-intolerant okay it is 7
o'clock now which means it is dinnertime
and I am excited to cook Charlie and I
just had a little debate as to whether
we were gonna do the chicken or the
teriyaki beef and I think we've decided
we're going to go with this option
tonight and let Charlie have the
deciding vote as I mentioned earlier
these meals are from hellofresh
and in case you're not heard of
hellofresh before it's basically the
UK's leading provider of home delivered
recipe boxes it's just for me it's a
fabulous way of making sure that I get a
nutritious meal at least three times a
week because it's just so easy what
Charlie and I used to find was a bit of
a problem was wastage Charlie always
would overcook I would always under cook
but what's so good about the recipes is
that they pre-portion Audion greedy ins
so you don't need to worry about
measuring anything you know you to worry
about wastage because you just say you
want to cook for two people you get the
exact right amount of ingredients and
basically nothing goes to waste which is
one of the main reasons why I absolutely
love it
but also it's just so so easy you get
foxy the instructions and it's very
visual and easy to read booklet shows
you how it's meant to look most of the
time mine doesn't look quite that good
but we always try and it tells you what
ingredients you need to find how long
it's gonna cook and some of the health
benefits so for example this one says
it's going to take 30 minutes and it's
going to be one of my five a day and
then fun fact
Terry within teriyaki is the Japanese
okay so my memory card just decided to
corrupt itself and then our next-door
neighbor came by to have a chat so half
an hour behind schedule I'm gonna crack
on right so I've got my recipe card
first thing to do is get the rice on
large saucepan of water brown rice nice
and healthy and then prepare the veg
let's do this
okay so step two is prep these veggies
now I'm gonna be able to cheat here it
says to finely chop the ginger and the
garlic but I'm gonna be lazy and stick
it in my thumb I mix aka the world's
most amazing blender and just kitchen
gadget ever so instead of spending five
minutes all the time and preparing these
and chopping them up and stick them in
there and whiz it all up next up in the
marinade normally would take a long time
to measure these ingredients but because
I have them all in there pre measured
out sizes in my packet it's not going to
take any time at all so I need the
garlic and ginger spring onion and honey
and soy sauce of which we have the
perfect quantities mix them all together
and that's the marinade
so charges came in to help me chop up
the beef and that is now resting in the
marinade just for about five minutes
gonna give the rice a little bit of time
to catch up what something to do next is
pop it in the saucepan and there are a
few tips here it says once all the stick
is cooked add the marinade and cook it
until bubbling and then add the steak
back in for further two minutes so that
should make it super duper tasty once
that's done it just got to cook the
vegetables and we're ready to serve
and dinner is served after following the
instructions super-easy we have two very
delicious looking and smelling beef
teriyaki dishes I was just saying
Charlie another reason why hello fresh
works so well for us is because we don't
really alternate between our evening
meals that much I think I read somewhere
that the average family of the average
couple rotates between these six evening
meals throughout like the whole year
which is pretty crazy to think how few
meals that we eat and we don't try that
many new things and even if we do we
sometimes just fall back into our usual
ways but beef teriyaki is something that
I wouldn't necessarily have tried myself
I just presumed given really really hard
but that was literally six instructions
if I can do it trust me anybody can not
the greatest chef in the world but this
looks and smells amazing so we are gonna
dig in
ten minutes later and we have to empty
bowls that was a great success still
can't quite believe how easy that was
and how tasty I will definitely be using
that recipe in the future Dickens is now
barking at me I think he's thinking that
it's um his chance to lick the bowl but
no chance I'm not gonna risk that and
charlie is just nipping across the road
to get some sweeties at which we're
gonna help for our desserts pinky no no
okay so as I mentioned earlier if you
want to try it out for yourself
I have 50% off your first and second box
which is very very generous great
discount get you started so I'll leave
that code linked down below you can
check that out Sam if you want to try it
out I'm now gonna head to the sofa with
my sweeties and chill out for the
evening and for my final a thing that I
will be consuming today the sweeties
charlie picked up from across the road
guilty pleasure I have got skittles and
an arrow
my number one preference is actually
skittles and Milky Way stars but the
corner shop across the road has stopped
doing the Milky Way stars so not going
to complain I am a fan of arrow um yeah
so just going to indulge in those we're
just chilling now watching Dragon's Den
and I'm gonna start editing this video
so hope you enjoyed today is what I eat
in a day a busy working day and what do
I consume on a busy day so yeah that's
all from me thanks so much for watching
and I'll see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
