re video a new week so it's Monday
morning and I started off the week in a
fabulous way up to school to dry by for
a blow dryers the ginormous class they
have collaborated with Lana so when you
get a blow dryer you get it finished
with our renewal oil which is such an
amazing treat they're also doing
manicure you get your money for their
new oil really really lovely and the
suckers
gorgeous and amazing start to what is
officially the most depressing death
year I think it's what like Blue Monday
but excuse me so far
I have a really cute girl so he was met
here completely take out
our owner circles
always
the same room said places
like swimming underwater but you control
my heart with Spencer kids
and a girl who pays your perfect one
can't
brain and this is just again
now you say I've just started off the
day by heading into tears sadly I've had
to give away my engagement ring I've had
to give it to them to get it resized and
because I needed to take it down to
sizes they can't just reset it they
actually have to make a whole new ring
so we're going to be taking the
individual diamonds out and setting it
on an entirely new rink just going to
take around six weeks so I'm gonna be
ringless for quite a while which it's
very upsetting but it's gonna be worth
it in the end I'd be wearing it for the
rest of my life so I can wait six weeks
anyway so I'm heading it to the Karen
Millen head offices now to do a shoot
for them we're going to be interviewing
their designer all about their new
collections actually really good fun
that's the plan for the day I will try
and show you my outfit when I find a
mirror or someone who can kindly film it
for me
so I'm in the caramel and head offices
now I'm going to give you the neat peek
behind the scenes of this video that
we're making it's gonna be coming out in
a couple of weeks time so I'll make sure
to let you know when it goes live but
this is quite the production obviously
when I'm at home this is me my tripod
remote camera now got all of these
lovely folks helping out just look at
this big sets happiness so we're just
having a chat through the new collection
this is the setting this is what you'll
be seeing talking through the new
collection what you're wearing
Fashion Week all that kind of jazz I'm
excited to show you finish video I'm
going to try and show you what I'm
wearing some obviously head to toe
Carolyn this tops that just come on to
the websites definitely adding this to
my wishlist and then I've got the
leggings on it they're like a faux
leather and the front and then enough to
get the back so you can get really
nicely in these shoes I'll just insert
the clip here here a little bit like the
Balenciaga boots but very very
comfortable definitely the kind of thing
you'll reach for time and time again
today with a bar work out with Liz I'm
just gonna very quickly show you my
workout outfit this job is one I cannot
remember where I came from you can be
super effective to me but really don't
have FDA Taylor and these are Betty
lagoons and my boss it's Wednesday
morning now and it's a busy day of
meetings today I didn't really get to
show you too much of what was happening
yesterday but it was a really fun day
filming with Karen Millen in their head
offices and then I did a workout class
with Liz Earle they were launching a new
cleanse and polish their new lovely
lavender fruit flavored drops a new
lavender addition that was a nice way to
end the day today as I mentioned it's
just pretty much back-to-back meetings
all day I'm actually wearing the same as
what I wore yesterday so I know I didn't
get show yesterday but I will show you
today
it's my Karen Millen Carol coats which
I've just been living in lately this bag
has been my most used thing of late and
it's actually come back in stock as well
as Ollie's are linked down below I know
a lot of you loved that and then if I
unravel the layers slightly and show you
what's underneath
yesterday I wore different role and echo
wall Mike hangman and one which was
especially a couple of years old this is
from Ted makeup still available and then
my Club Monaco feathers relay which is
in the sale at the moment and then I've
got my
Kate Spade leopard print trousers and my
Reis mules as well
I've already had meetings today with
Clarence caught up about all their new
launches have some lovely goodies to try
later and then I met the girls from Ted
Baker as well and they've given me a
lovely couple of new dresses to try out
so I'm going to show you those later on
now I'm gonna taxi at the moment heading
to a place called Ellen cafe which I've
seen a Pete a few people featuring on
their Instagram I think it's one of
these really beautiful kind of marble
flowers and very pink Instagram all
cafes so I will show you what it looks
like in their parent London's the latest
Instagram hotspot so yeah time for the
day
I know okay meeting at Ellen cafe is
done it was super Instagram go inside
they had like little teddy bears and
dogs on the copies which was really
really cute I would say that the one on
Brompton Road by the looks of pictures
is more Instagram because it's kind of
like more outdoors but more daylight
where as your SATs underground here but
I will check that out for research
purposes I'm now gonna go and meet
charlie we have got to be meeting
together and then we're gonna head home
and do a little bit stay true to the
fire in your heart in your soul don't
rage your desire in what you can't
control
we fly we fly try so hard to get there
and we bye
we might be lost but not forever
evening darlings it's now a few hours
later it's about seven o'clock and I'm
about to head out for dinner I have not
really changed my outfit I've just
topped up my makeup pinned my hair back
and I've actually just switched my coats
I'm now wearing my Reese coat over my
shoulders I just thought it was a little
bit more smart and then I've also
changed my bag to something smaller
didn't know if this was a little bit of
a clash with Deauville leopard but this
is my Aspinall bag still can't remember
the name of it need to research that i
will leave a link down below but this
one is a really nice size it's just a
one that you hold with your hand it does
have any an over shoulder strap to you
but I don't use it and it's got this
little leopard print detail which I
thought tied in quite nicely to my
trousers as before my Reese use same
jewelry as before I have added on a
couple of rings look how pale my hands
are but yeah my hand just felt super
empty without my engagement ring so I've
added my Monica vanad Arriva ring and
then my astron mirror ring on my middle
finger so that's the look of the evening
good morning it is now Thursday
we are very lucky actually because we
are the first people to be trying out
this new frame of workout which is on
furnace Street so really central
location and Elizabeth Arden are hosting
a class this morning we're going to find
out about a new product launch which by
the looks of Eva's little compressor is
over here is their Super Start probiotic
boost so I can't afford to give him an a
try I'm the only one here in the moment
sleep early for once in my life amazing
changing rooms got the second Hollywood
mirrors Sun we can put right out of
class it's a frame class which I've not
tried before but this is the product
probiotic cleanser whip to play sounds
amazing I'm gonna get that right
afterwards so a nice active start to the
day I'll try and show you my gym outfit
that's always it's all such Betty
actually I've lied it's not all sweaty
Betty once this is a sweaty Betty vest
and then my gym bra is actually from
Lululemon and then my leggings are the
ones I got from the sweaty Betty
but Scott in class the other day
so just finished work as well as of a
shower
I hope they'll try out a new fan mother
is in these superstars probiotic
cleanser with latex
so I think it's going to be like a Lucy
and then dry like the name
all right so I'm going to leave out my
skin for a few minutes and it's almost
going on and it's almost gonna act like
a fit your loss
good morning my darlings and happy
Friday I'm so pleased it was almost the
weekend so today Charlie and I had our
personal training session with Adam at
virgin I was meant to go three times
this week but because I had my workout
yesterday at frame with Elizabeth Arden
and I also had my bar core class when
was that on Tuesday with Liz oh I
thought you know what I can just get her
over to PT sessions this week so that
was fun I refill in love with this
really old gym kit and I try and find
something similar online and to link it
down below but it was from Anthropologie
a long time ago in fact that gym kit was
one of the first things I was ever sent
by a brand and I could not believe that
they were sending me this gym kit that I
think was worth like over a hundred
pound to the top and bottoms so yeah
fell back in love with an old gym kit
and today now I'm actually just in kind
of like very sloppy clothing at the
moment it's just been doing some emails
and things it's about half 11:00 charlie
is out at the gym again
shooting with cats he's doing lots of
fitness content on his YouTube channel
if you don't follow charlie or if you
want your boyfriend to follow him then
I'll leave Charlie's channel down below
he's doing much more regular videos now
which is great and then when they get
back I'm gonna go out to shoot with cats
and Charlie we're gonna just rotate and
I think we're going to go to my usual
place which is around Pal mal kind of
Trafalgar Square area and I have some
really really beautiful new pieces to
shoot Rhys very kindly sent me some
pieces yesterday and one of the pieces
is a really lovely smart coat I'll show
you that in a second and then also Ted
Baker very very kindly as well I've been
really spoiled this week sent over the
most beautiful dress it's in fact I'm
just going to show you it's this like
it's like a mixture between a dress and
a coat this gorgeous material I'm gonna
flip you around so you can see it in the
mirror excuse my steamer in the way but
it's as beautiful it's like the kind of
thing that you'd wear so like a royal
wedding it's just so spectacular
I haven't tried it on yet so I'm really
really looking forward to trying this
and I just want to shoot some gorgeous
photos wearing this I might take this to
Paris on Monday and so yeah looking
forward to shooting that this cheque
item here this is the coat that I was
referring to you from
this is where I put my kind of knew in
need to shoot things and then when I'm
filming one of my usual videos like my
styling videos I'll kind of rearrange it
and make it look really pretty but for
now it's just new in also got a new
dress from Ted Baker and you top from
Ted Baker I've shot these bits already
River island and reefs that's been shot
already
I was sent these two dresses from a
brand called chichi London and they're
absolutely gorgeous
really lovely fairly affordable for you
know really beautiful dresses kind of
self portrait style says that one and
then this one here looking forward to
giving those a try I might shoot them
next week though a head saw house
hopefully we're gonna get to go there
again beautiful skirt from Rhys and then
this coats oh my gosh this is literally
me in a coat it's like a cape almost I'm
so excited to try this on so yeah lots
of lovely things to shoot today I'm
going to just I think I've probably got
about half an hour before Charlie and
Kat get back so I'm just going to mix
and match mix and match the outfits put
together some accessories and then I pop
everything that I'm going to shoot in my
suitcase it's lovely Ted Baker suitcase
and I'll take it into town with me
little bit later on in the day now and
I'm out shooting with Kat and Charlie we
are in we're in our usual place down by
pal
and put onto the last outfit of the day
so I'll show you a little bit of behind
the scenes we've shot three outfits
today for Instagram and vlog and YouTube
so yeah last one
here's watch a behind the scenes shirt
looks like
they may have made my coffee a little
bit too frothy this morning hey good
morning it's Saturday I have got major
foundation that's need to put some lip
balm on it suddenly it's really really
gloomy today I was hoping it's you
filmed some videos I still might film
some videos because I don't know what
else I'm gonna film them I don't have a
Sunday video yet but yeah so I'm just
having quite chilled mornings so far
Charlie has gone to the gym but he says
he's just gonna do some stretching I
might just do some stretching in the
house because after yesterday's workout
Friday mornings workout I am so a key my
back is aching weirdly and my bum has
never felt so sore ever so yeah I might
just go on YouTube and find some butt
stretching exercises that sounds really
really gross yeah I'm gonna just have a
chilled morning and I'm gonna set my
lights up and see what the lighting
looks like hopefully film some videos at
the moment I'm just wearing my kind of
slobbing around the house outfit this is
a really soft jumper from Zara with
little pearls on and then my leggings
are also Zara they've got these like
blue pearls on the ankles so I'm kind of
in the matching pearls our outfit today
probably gonna change my jumper to film
the video because I feel like this one
is just a little bit too casual so yeah
gonna set everything up and hopefully do
some filming okay filming is done I
filmed two videos I filmed the intro for
the video you will have seen yesterday
which is all about how to style the row
neck or turtleneck I had to google the
difference it's the same thing but
apparently us Brits call them row necks
or polo necks and Americans called in
turtlenecks
so there's your fun fact for today and
don't have too much tidying up to do
today just a little bit of mess normally
this room turns into a bomb site when I
do filming I also filmed my dupes video
you guys have been requesting that so
long so here's a little sneak peek of
some of the dupes which I mentioned so
make sure you're subscribed if you don't
want to miss that
I'm hoping it will be coming on
Wednesday speaking of subscribing and I
have a little request if there are any
of you guys watching that
tune into my videos really regularly but
you haven't actually just hit the
subscribe button yet then why not make
that day today I'm trying to hit 250,000
subscribers which is of course quarter
of a million which is just an insane
milestone if you guys have been with me
for a little while you'll know that when
I hit a hundred thousand I was like this
is it I've reached my pinnacle but you
know you just got to have new goals and
250,000 is my next goal so if you're
watching and you're enjoying and please
do hit the subscribe button because that
would make my day thank you very much
so yeah Charlie's not home yet he said
he was gonna be an hour and he left like
three hours ago so maybe he ended up
doing a full-on workout hopefully that
also means he's gone to Sainsbury's so I
don't have to kill her later so that's
pretty much my update I'm gonna now tidy
up this and then maybe do a little bit
of editing so it's still super gloomy
outside but do you need to take the dogs
for a walk
one good morning it is Sunday and we are
on route to Charlie's mom and dad's
house dry usual Sunday roast we keep
traditions also guard scarlatina in the
back
it was currently on puppy duty although
Dexter has now been to sequin hunt
yeah it's pouring with rain
it's rather miserable today but
hopefully as Sunday Rose is going to
make it all better and we have become
addicted to this song from this girl
that Charlie went to uni with wasn't so
named Georgia Buchanan but her party's
name is called immediately yeah and her
single is called give and take I'm going
to try and play a little bit here don't
know if you chip will copyright it I can
even link down below because it is so
addictive it was a really really good
song good work out so much to work out
and we're back home again I never liked
to vlog too much during family lunches I
find it a little bit too intense and no
one really wants a camera thrust in
their face I'm relaxing so I just
thought I would sign off here I didn't
really show you today's outfit of the
day but I've been wearing my Reis
reversible juillet this is the olive or
chocolate colored one it's like a
leather on the outside and then a faux
fur on the inside really really snuggly
this top I think there are a few laughs
tits in the sale it's some Ted Baker but
I got it in the January sales got these
amazing sleeves I think you may also see
me styling it on Friday with a suede
skirt as well super versatile top
necklace is I don't know if you've seen
this one that much but it's little
diamond heart from Monica vinod I love
that one these jeans are actually from
Anthropologie I got them when I did a
collaboration with them at least a year
ago and they had someone doing painting
like denim painting in the store
so I'm not sure if you can see it but I
actually have a sausage dog you really
can't see it
I saw chunk painted on the bottom of
these trousers and then once again my
rustle and Romney boots which are just
amazing for trudging around during
winter so that's been my chilled Sunday
outfit of the day I'm gonna sign off now
and thank you for watching if you got
this far then please somehow leave the
word diamond in the comments so I know
who your amazing wonderful people are
that got to the very end of this video
cuz it's been a long one that's for sure
next week slash tomorrow for me now we
are going into Paris for a couple of
days I'm doing and talk with the Twitter
head offices so that should be really
good fun and so yeah stay tuned for that
