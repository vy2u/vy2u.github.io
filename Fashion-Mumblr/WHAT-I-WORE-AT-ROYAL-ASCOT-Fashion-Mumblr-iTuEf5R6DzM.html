welcome to a new day in right which is
in the usual coastal town I mean you
know you can sleep over with me so much
other useful we've just had a lovely
lunch and have now checked into our
rooms I have a beautiful garden room
we're staying at a hotel called the
galavant so lovely very cozy seaside
vibes this is my boudoir beautiful big
double bed and then behind me I've got a
bathtub so I'm definitely gonna have a
soak later got quite a little work to do
something I'm just gonna buckle down and
do some work make myself a nice coffee
and then we've got yoga on the beach at
4 o'clock hopefully the weather's gonna
get a little bit brighter fingers
crossed so yoga and then a nice seaside
festival themed dinner which should be
good fun but for now I'm going to get a
little bit of work done do a few emails
to know how to keep this jumper from
popping up all the time
yeah we also have some goodies here from
Maison Margiela they've popped a little
picture this is one of my moldy of snaps
and then Oh
what do we have in here ooh la la this
is one of the new fragrances this one is
called sailing day oh my goodness
so the location for this is Paris and
chai and i are currently looking at
going to Paris that is perfect timing
okay so I've just quickly got changed
and Amy and I are going to head out and
take some photos while the sun is
shining but I thought I'd quickly show
you my outfit but I've got changed into
I'm actually all-in at Topshop so I've
got this lovely little floral crop top
which I thought was really cute before
the settings and then let me tell you
down a little bit this adorable little
number is a bum bag or like whenever you
call it a belt bag and it's a straw
material and then these
and then the trousers are some jeans
also from Topshop and kind of see them a
little bit better here the lighting in
here is a little bit crazy so that's my
change of outfit really like this top
and I think it was like 32 pounds or
something really it's quite sure though
so I've put on that this like lacy
bandeau top bra underneath Osprey
Topshop I mention your head to toe so
we're gonna go and head to the beach
take some photos and then I think we're
going on a beach walk so I'll catch up
with you and we're heading out on that
call it for you just for the bags for
all the toys call me silly I know your
mind don't be trying to get away baby
stay if you
crystal no rest on the love seek it out
bring it in take it off cuz I can see
the storm in
Oh
hello again so as you just saw we just
did yoga on the beach
we are literally staying across the road
from the famous camber sand beach and is
absolute beautiful the sand is like
Maldivian it is so soft and lovely so we
had a beautiful relaxing yoga session
with lots of stretches I was totally
covered in the sand so I just had a very
quick shower not on my hair though so
I'm gonna just do something with this
and now I've just got into my little
reef place suit this is actually the
first time I've tried this on and it's
currently in the sale so if you want to
grab a bargain I'll leave a link down
below but Amy and I again I'm gonna take
some dinner pre-dinner pictures so we
finish getting ready and I'm going to be
wearing a Maison Margiela fragrance for
this evening which is called lipstick on
so that's going to be my scent for
tonight
you can feel it go
good morning darlings so I think the
last vlog clip that you saw was me for
pairing my bath after a lovely breakfast
at the galavan hotel in Rye that was
actually a couple of days ago I'm now
home again makeup free as you can tell
I'm about to start getting ready for a
day at Royal Ascot I'm very excited to
be going today one of Royal Ascot it's
such a lovely time of year I also just
started editing my vlog clips previously
and yes we may have had a couple of
glasses of rose a when we were filming
that last clip Victoria and I so
apologies for the tips you vlogging um
so yeah I'm gonna I'm actually going to
film myself getting ready for a skirt so
stay tuned for an upcoming video if
you'd like to see how I transform my
self I'm gonna so I'm gonna skip over
all of that bit now but stay tuned for
the future video to get ready with me if
you want to see how I turn myself from
this to this so we are now as royal as
I'm with my darling I love the dress
though your dresses okay thank you my
darling my time is really welcoming yeah
but here we can make it so I can take
over and touch take over on the instance
Tori's and some pictures berm so it's
pretty good fun the queen is arriving in
an hour or so we have heard word inside
knowledge at Megamart is also coming
today with Harry so fingers crossed
we'll be able to get a good spot on the
evening she'll be wearing color I'm
gonna guess the queen is going to be in
a bright color I'm gonna go with yellow
I don't know
I think Megan's gonna wear pink and you
have a fabulous floor has
I mean I'm hoping she's gonna everything
does that I'll be very on trend so we
are going to have a little Mucha rounds
we are in the Queen Anne enclosure which
is the main enclosure biggest best and
hopefully they are going to be able to
place couple of bats we know we bet
mostly on horses and the related extra
Dickens and strategy did not pay off
no so I think today maybe we need to
slightly adjust or do we just back
ourselves the nesting Dicky Oh dick he's
gonna pull through yeah I'm actually I'm
actually betting on behalf of Dickens
they're gonna go and find a total facing
bat find somewhere to make our base and
then enjoy races
hey they're all that I think about
you know you can't go
so the first racism actually start for
another hour or so we've just come down
to the side of the racetrack going to
get tonight action shots and nice photos
before it gets totally mattnic around
here I'm absolutely loving this outfit
curving and everyone had so many
beautiful office yesterday so amazing
hands I've seen lots of groups of
friends as well where they all decide on
a color scheme well they decided on
possible its own look calm and dressed
together so gonna please it's ride the
race right now throughout all the action
will be happening very soon and let me
show you behind me as well this is the
grandstand very much so this is the
Royal Ascot grandstand Tryon Holly
looking fabulous and their Ted outfits
and this is the finishing line
she
dying
she sounds like a concept is being
phrase around
yes
birthday
what are you most excited for time
actually sounds ominous
I placed my bet so we finished our tea
so let's go down to the racecourse
wish me luck I went for number 13 but
and we are back home again had such a
fun day at Royal Ascot I did not win any
of my bets I sadly have come home 20
pound less well off but never mind
swings and roundabouts so back home
again now we actually drove back before
the day to finish because we don't want
to get stuck in all the traffic it does
get very hectic I am now so excited to
take my makeup off and apply a face mask
I have a couple of little gremlins
appearing on my chin its I'm gonna have
a real pound possession so I thought I'd
show you my pamper evening skincare
routine I can't wait to get all of this
makeup off and then when I've got my
face mask on when my face is lovely and
cleansed I'm just gonna do some emails
because we've been busy all day and
there has not been very much Wi-Fi and
Ascot so I have a lot of work that needs
to be done as well as uploading lots of
Instagram stories but first let's head
to the bathroom and take off one of his
makeup so don't start with some nice
little water this is the rodeo dragon's
blood cleansing water and this will get
rid of the majority of my makeup and
then my cleanser will clean at the skin
so the micellar water was taken off all
of my makeup does a really good job of
cleansing the skin of any makeup now I'm
going to use mine liselle cleanse and
polish I always go for this while my
skin just needs calming down this is my
sweet orange and clove flavor it's a
free pop kind of day see this is why I
double cleanse because if I'd only done
the Meister water what did this would
still be on my face okay so my skin is
cleansed and like he polished thanks to
the exfoliating cloth this is not a
little one but it's just one that I
grabbed normally I would now use the Liz
Earle skin tonic but I've run out so
I've been using I'm trying to use up
this in the meantime
it's Perricone MD exfoliating pore
refiner this is it's got fruit acids in
there which naturally help to buff away
any dead skin cells so really good as a
post cleansing finish and now that my
skin is perfectly clean I'm going to try
the goddess skin clay mask from
Charlotte Tilbury I've not used this
before which is a risky strategy but
I've heard really good things and
Charlotte till we can do no wrong so
hopefully this will calm and brighten my
skin
and now I'm just going to get changed
put my comfy clothes on leave this on
for 10 minutes and probably going more
to the garden or something and then when
I finish with this I will pop on let's
see what will I put on probably my high
rose hip oil this is really good for
healing the skin and because I do have
some blemishes I feel like my skin would
love that
and then my it cosmetics confidence in a
cream moisturizer again this one says
Regents already nourishing and I think
my skin will enjoy that so that's the
plan I will catch it with you a little
bit later so I've slipped out of my
lovely Ted Baker dress into something a
little bit more appropriate for lounging
around the house in and I just been
catching up on my social media catching
on my Instagram and I have to say thank
you
so everybody who shared the love on my
Ted Baker
Instagram post this one here I've just
been reading the comments over a hundred
and thirty-six comments that are all so
so lovely so if you took the time to
comment then thank you very much it's
going down at very very well I have to
say again a little shout-out to my
presets thankfully I was able to edit on
the go on my phone because all my
presets are now available on mobile
phone so if you want to be able to edit
any of your pictures whether you took it
on the phone on a camera and just make
them look absolute beautiful you can now
do that and all the presets are
available separately so the pictures
that I took today at a skirt I'll show
you a couple of befores and after edits
here I could edit without the need for
my laptop so I will leave the
information for the presets down below
you can buy them all singularly this one
was the Valencia pretty sets and I just
absolutely love it I just posted another
photo as well this one here this is what
it looked like before my filter and then
this is what it looked like afterwards
and I don't do any additional editing
literally just paste my filter on in the
app or on my laptop and then click
publish easy as that and you
that's what I've been doing catching up
on my social medias I'm gonna take this
mask off now it hasn't set like some
clay masks sometimes do it's still a
little bit like tacky but that's fine
I've been wearing it for at 15 minutes
so I think it's time to come off and I
think I'm gonna end the vlog here
because the lens is totally messed up
let me actually show you what my camera
looks like right now cuz it's so broken
really hard to show you but basically
the screen as you can see is like
hanging off oh my goodness so hopefully
I'm gonna be able to get the camera
fixed before we go on a holiday umm but
yeah I'm gonna end the vlog here before
my camera does completely fall apart so

got to the end thank you very very much
