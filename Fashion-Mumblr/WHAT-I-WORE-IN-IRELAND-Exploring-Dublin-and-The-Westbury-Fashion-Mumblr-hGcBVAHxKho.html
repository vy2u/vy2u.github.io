yesterday's video today we are in Dublin
Ireland we've just flown from London
Gatwick it was really short flight and
really scenic as well we flew over
beautiful Irish coast I know full of
features and we are now at the Westbury
hotel where we're spending the night
tonight and we've got a really lovely
couple of days and here in Dublin and we
already have our first drama of the trip
because what have you done Endora okay
he's blaming the suitcase basically
Charlie has locked himself out of the
suitcase so we've got the concierge
kindly coming up to help us break into
it but we've just had a mini tour of the
hotel and it is absolutely stunning I
will show you guys all around a little
bit later our room is absolutely
beautiful which I enormous room and they
left us some really lovely treats as
well we've got some cake doesn't
champagne even a selection of perfume
and a cannibal so we're already being
really really spoiled they were saying
that this is one of the only five-star
hotels in Dublin it's the only hotel
that still family-run or the only luxury
hotel it's still family-run here in
Dublin it's owned by the Doyle family
which is the same family that owned
Galloway Terrace in London that kind of
gives you an idea of how this one tool
is here already I've seen it so many is
photo hotspots and yeah we're basically
going to go down for lunch in one of the
lovely restaurants and then we have the
fashion editor of the Irish Times and in
theory she's going to show us around the
fashion culture here in Dublin and
explain to some of the history so really
excited for that and I will take you
guys along with me I'm going to get
changed
finished doing my makeup because I'm
very halfway there at the moment
um but yeah it's going to feel une
before we have a drama
and you
okay after fouling out
Oh
and farting
thank you
maybe
like help me not
and then we went in here he's your king
Oh
come to me
that's all
so we're back at the lovely hotel now
after our mini tour of Dublin we really
looked around all the shopping areas
went into a kind of double inversion of
Selfridges which is really lovely
definitely need to explore that more
tomorrow as well as a really cute little
macaroon and chocolate store and where
else there we go Oh a luxury leather to
love maker it was really surprising to
see so many kind of artisan stores in
Dublin definitely very different to what
I was expecting it doesn't mean surprise
so we've just spent the past hour or so
just relaxing here in the hotel I've
written an entire blog post in record
time I seem to always be more inspired
when we're anywhere other than home so
very pleased with it afternoon's
productivity and we're now going to get
changed ready for dinner so I'll show
you what I'm going to we're just going
to talk about my makeup quickly as well
and I'm really excited this night
Jamaica's we're going to the wild
restaurant which is here in the hotel
itself it's the one that I showed you a
few clicks off earlier very beautiful
restaurant and the menu looks amazing so
I'm going to get ready and I'll see you
in a moment
ten minutes later and we're done stop
taking the mick this one is always
taking the mick out of me sorry the last
few clips that have really bad lighting
I just realized I have this camera on
the wrong setting
I've just redone my makeup I'm really
happy with the makeup products I'm using
at the moment so I will show you some of
those later one's going to be some again
tomorrow morning and also the lighting
this room it's really flattering which
just makes it even harder for seeing a
makeup in natural daylight anyway the
girlies are all ready let's go down
member
Oh
Oh
my name sorry I didn't finish the vlog
off properly last night I was in
somewhat of a food coma after our
incredible meal at wild restaurant I
showed you a few clips what we had but
we just had very much food starters the
mains or side dishes just absolutely
delicious highly recommend the mac and
cheese and steak and everything
basically all delicious cialis is far
too full and if we'd come and to pick up
the camera I had an amazing night sleep
here at the Westbury I've just been
making a little fluffy there we go which
one of my favorite products of the
moment and now we're going to head down
to breakfast we're going to the musical
defense restaurants which is where we
had lunch yesterday we're going to go
there for breakfast meeting the rest of
the group and then we have some free
time just explore the local area we had
a whirlwind tour yesterday but I think
we're going to head out buy ourselves
some shops and see what else we can find
I've been asking it for your
recommendations on Twitter as well and
have a look through those in a second
also said yesterday though is going to
tell you about some of my current and
beauty favorites I'm really happy with
my routine at the moment the main thing
is this this is the new by Terry hydro
comfort aqua balm and I find efficient
I'm traveling my skin to need a little
bit more hydration but this isn't like a
total gel like the sundae Riley for
example I just find it exactly on my
skin needs at the moment and it smells
amazing secondly this is the Milani
retouch and raised light lifting
concealer and it's probably the only
thing I've tried recently that actually
makes me look alive in the face and
doesn't make me look like I have
horrendous I bags really blendable and
it's just very handy with this little
cushion applicator finally and I think a
lot of people will agree with this one I
know look you have tried it it's the Max
Factor baked bronzer in creme and a
creme bronzer in light gold
it looks quite similar see hourglass in
that it's it's lovely effect and I think
this is nine pounds but I'm just so
impressed with it the color is beautiful
very even and gives you a little bit of
shimmer
not too much so I thought I'd give this
little shower child those gotta go down
for breakfast in five I need to get
changed and do something my hair freshly
blow-dried I'll see you guys in two
minutes so I finally got my canon g7x
marking again so you should see a major
improvement in the lighting but I wanted
to show you my makeup after I just
explained the beauty products because I
realize how I looked before and that
lighting probably wasn't doing any
favors but as you can see the bronzer is
it's a really lovely kind of light color
very natural but I think it's really
nice to just add a bit of a glow to the
face and my under eye area I'm just so
pleased at how bright and fresh it looks
I'm also loving kind of half packed away
included and now I know these are super
expensive but this is a new to me Tom
Ford I shadow palette and it's a three
news dip and the colors inside this
which I cannot open it one-handed hold
understand and done these are just the
perfect nude colors I've pretty much
only been using this at the past few
days and to find it good for day the
night everything in between and it's
just the most beautiful formula so
that's some beauty shout outs look at
this view behind us it's so gorgeous
Dublin City skyline looking forward to
exploring later
and yes heading down for breakfast now
let's go okay so we have left our hotel
which is literally in the perfect
location it's right in the middle of
like shopping area Grafton Street trying
to refrain from see me Ed Sheeran song
every time I see the sign now as we
found out a good church on that on
Grafton Street you know baguette oh my
god yeah so now I feel like we found
ourselves in statue central which is 39
or do get what you're going to tell you
wants to get stereotypical shot outside
the most Irish pubs you can find a zip
line to get it so that's what we're
looking for at the moment and quite a
lot of bars around here with the Irish
flag for example yeah definitely snagged
essential and then we're going to head
to the river taking the vistas and head
back towards the main town area lots of
really beautiful buildings also lots of
them road work so suddenly not going to
get any picture-perfect shots but
I'm sorry when I shake watch me work and
if I can stir if I should fall just go
ahead and catch me baby
so after nipping into a couple of the
shops on Grafton Street and surrounding
area
charleen I've now made our way to I
think this is called Stephen's Green or
Stephen's Green I guess it's probably
Dublin's
on to the Hyde Park it's a really
beautiful big park nice Lake duck very
idyllic and we roll and here for another
half hour or so making most of sunshine
and then we are heading back the hotel
but I want to sort of
I would like to visit a coffee shop with
accessibility oh yes yes there is
offering tea at the West three again
which I am already oh my gosh you've got
doctors here yeah which I'm already
looking for we are back at your web 3 is
nothing afternoon tea I'm going to show
you a behind the scenes of a proper
opportunity because little knowledge
leave photographs again but we do that
watching all the Ameren sorry
joining you better grab that tongue
rings I think we may be forced to kasi
Rachel troll back home again after the
easiest journey assessment our flight
from Dublin to Gatwick so just took us
no time at all it feels like an hour ago
as I was sitting enjoying that lovely
afternoon tea at the Westbury lobby area
and yeah we're home and we've just
ordered a curry from across the road and
I'm dying to go into my pajamas so you
guys don't need to see that I think I'm
gonna end the vlog here I can't say what
it is yet but tomorrow's vlog is going
