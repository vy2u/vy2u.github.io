vlog is starting in Paris however
unfortunately as my best guess from the
raleigh it is actually pouring with rain
and so Charlie and I are actually going
to call it quits we were originally
going to be exploring today but it is
absolutely healing it down so we're
going to head back to our hotel and just
get a little bit of work done which is a
shame because we're only here for two
days or
so technically
we did have a nice lunch on the rusical
nice but very expensive lunch and went
into a few stores including in the big
Chanel store and I fell
so many bags and then we made our way
down the Rue de Rivoli which is really
beautiful area where I shot us about the
photos last remarks here are we are now
at the Petit Palais which you by Erin my
brolly you can kind of see behind me yes
absolute rentals so we're just called an
uber and we're going to make our way
back to the hotel for an afternoon of
work I did not choose a good day to wear
suede oh yeah
okay it's a few hours later now and the
rain clouds have vanished boo boo we
have blue skies in Paris finally I'm
actually out exploring on my own now
because Charlie the tables have turned
Charlie has got lots of work on just a
few seconds from our hotel is the opera
building so I thought I'd come and be a
little tourist for the day so I'm going
to just have a little look around here
and then I'm going to go to some shops
from Tom's and galleries Lafayette while
I can see them they're really really
close by so I'm going to do a little bit
of retail therapy maybe to spend a
couple of hours exploring and then head
back to the hotel and we're gonna do a
little bit of work and find some a nice
for dinner but I thought I would take
you guys around with me keep me company
I wish he was here at least we could
take ninth out the present makes this
place is so stunning but I'm just going
to absorb it and taking the beauty
my outfit of the day though I am wearing
my Topshop jumper I've been wearing this
so much lately it's the coziest piece
ever and then this Reese coat I'm so so
glad I got this it's just one of those
pieces that when you're wearing quite a
plain outfit makes a whole outfit look
really fashionable so really liking this
and then
Aspinall trunk bag which gain is really
chic way to finish an outfit
and I'm wearing my river island suede
leggings and my Karen Millen boots I
have got my brolly with me as well
because
even in Scott at the moment if it starts
to rain like you did earlier I will be
in trouble
so midway through shopping and I just
had to squirrel myself away on a little
side street because apparently someone
from The Telegraph forgive me
little chat about the pieces are running
all about how young people today aspire
to become youtubers and social media
stars over being say a teacher or a
firefighter or a sports star and so I'm
just
now should be really really exciting
opportunity I always love to
a youtuber or influencer and hopefully
inspire other people to do the same
thing around so
we know what these Germans can be like
but yeah you know how the naturally
could have come to Paris about getting
some macaroons Charlie has joined me
he's just hanging and we've just come to
someone's old cafe push key probably
butchered that name but nice little
selection box you're gonna nibble on
those or we do a little bit more in
scoring really are you going to go far
wait cheese drink actually no vanilla
Cheers
it's Tuesday and we're starting the day
in the Twitter head offices I'm doing my
toolbar this morning thought I would
give you a little tour around Alps they
are very very snazzy a little breakfast
setup here most exciting birds have
behind me sweetie canister sugar high
later and then they've got a lovely
lounge area where they have the
hilarious video playing a guy wants
children
and I'm sure you won't be doing my talk
later
Oh
the talk went really really well this
morning at the Twitter offices and now
Joey and I have dispensed ad if you want
for a be nice front face that Charlie
discovered one of our photographers
recommends it it's really really tasty I
had pancakes and Charlie had a slightly
healthier option and now we're just out
exploring for our last couple of hours
luckily the rain has held off it's a
little bit gray but not raining which is
wonderful we've gone down all the main
shopping streets and now we've just
found a very cute little cafe in this
beautiful courtyard so we're just
spending our last hour here before
heading to garden or so yesterday I
mentioned that I had a call with the
journalist from The Telegraph and he has
already published the article it's all
about whether YouTube is an attainable
career after that report came out that
schoolchildren have been a youtubers
like their number one job aspiration I
will leave that article links down below
if you want to have a little read of
that but yeah we're just going to enjoy
last coffee in Maui and I'll not notes
actually later on in this vlog I do have
an opportunity for one of you to win a
trip to Paris or one of you on a plus
one to win a trip to Paris so stay tuned
if you would like to know how you can
win your own romantic weekend break in
Paris that's coming later on Bonjour
again so it's now Wednesday and today is
a working from home day getting things
sorted out Charlie and I got back from
Paris late last night so we have spent
the morning just unpacking and sorting
our clothes out putting a few laundry
loads on house chores things like that
so that brings me on really nicely to
talk to you about how I create my
signature scent with the help of Leonor
so Leonor you may know they have fabric
conditioners and their latest launch is
actually something called a fabric
enhancer it's all about how you can
enhance your signature fragrance with
the help of their fabric conditioners
this is my favorite one and not just
because it's pink but this is the blush
one and it's kind of a sweet and woody
fragrance which really matches the kind
of perfumes that I opted for when I'm
choosing what perfume
to wear during the day it's quite sweet
it's got sandalwood in there so just
perfectly matches my signature style and
how I like to smell I do get asked a lot
of questions about how I care from my
clothes obviously in my wardrobe I have
lots of really lovely soft sumptuous
materials I have lots of cashmere and a
lot of light colors so I feel like over
the last six years or so or I've been
living by myself and obviously not by
myself but not having my mum do my
laundry I've really kind of mastered the
art of caring for my clothes and the new
launch from Lenore is really just an
enhancement on that I almost think of it
as kind of a beauty lifestyle product as
opposed to a laundry product it's just
too luxurious to think of as a laundry
product I mean look at it it's
absolutely beautiful
but what it does mean is that when I am
caring for my clothes I can also make a
choice about the signature scent that's
going to linger on the products for so
much longer obviously as you know with
fragrances you can spend hundreds of
pounds on a perfume very quickly you can
become immune to that scent which i
think is why fragrance combining has
become really popular in the past year
or so and my personal favorite fragrance
is also probably the nation's favourite
fragrance you guys know what that is and
so many other girls wear it so to have
products as part of my laundry hair
routine which can really help me to
create more of a personalized signature
scent is something that I really love so
typically in your head you might be
thinking of that freshly laundered
clothes smell which don't get me wrong I
absolutely love that fragrance but these
are just something far more special than
that they use the same expertise and
ingredients behind traditional perfumery
they really are a step above very
luxurious and as I said more part of
your beauty and lifestyle routine just a
luxury lifestyle choice that actually I
think is a really important one we wear
our clothes obviously all the time they
are the products that we have that are
closest to our skin just like our
perfume and it's a really personal
choice so it's just so lovely to be able
to add a simple product like this into
your home routine and make such an
impact on how you feel when you're
wearing your clothes because to me
that's just so so special so as I
mentioned
my favorite is this one at the blush and
I'm not gonna lie I did choose it
because it was pink but I have actually
fallen in love with the fragrance
Charlie's favorite however is this one
dazzle I can tell that he uses far too
much when he puts it in the wash because
this one is far emptier than my blush
scented one dazzle I would say is more
of an energizing fragrance it's really
nice when you just get bursts of the
scent on your workout gear for example
it's got eucalyptus and patchouli in
there patchouli as well is one of the
ingredients in some of my favorite
perfumes and some of Charlie's as well
so not really surprising that that's his
favorite another one in the range from
la parfum de Secrets is kiss that one
has got amber and passionfruit and
actually when it comes to fragrance
layering and making my clothes smell
really amazing for a long period of time
that's the one that I have been really
enjoying for that and then finally we
have mystery and that one is the I think
that's the dark blue bottle that one is
like white flowers it's a lot more of a
light and whimsical fragrance I say out
of all of them that's probably the most
universally likeable so if you want
something that's quite enduring and
fresh quite musky then that's the one to
go for so yeah as you can tell I'm quite
smitten with this new launch something
that's super easy to add into my
household routine and that also works my
beauty routine really works with my own
personal fragrance makes my fragrance on
my clothing lasts so much longer and it
really is a luxury product I just
absolutely love so on that note Lenore

eight pound from Tesco so I'm going to
leave the link to where you can enter
that and all the information down below

penis coming feeling so high
breathe it burn it
when we get close with gonna slow house
come to Duke of York square which is in
Chelsea for a facial at Liz Earle I've
had one before and they're absolutely
heavenly exactly what you need to cheer
you up 180 day and it also was a little
bit early for others in my life that
sign dips into sorrow because they're
Zara on Jacob York Square has an amazing
home section for once I actually had
good service in there someone else she
went out to the back and got me six
napkins I'm gonna show you what I got
when I get home but I've just got to the
Liz L flagship so let's go inside
pampering
good morning it is now Thursday morning
and today I have a few meetings out the
house I have a really lovely afternoon
tea later on and then I have a really
fabulous event to go to for the launch
of the Carolina Herrera fragrance and
Karlie Kloss is going to be there I'm
gonna see if I can also sneak in a blow
dry between my last meeting and the
event because as you may know we haven't
had hot water in a while we do actually
have the builders coming around today to
install a new boiler they've put all of
their kind of building supplies in my
wardrobe room so I can't get into my
wardrobe which is very annoying so today
I'm just wearing and actually I've just
got my socks on or not my boots yet so I
looked a little bit silly but I'm
wearing my suede skirt again it's
already becoming the most worn piece in
my wardrobe my Tory Burch Roenick and
then my Club Monaco feather G lay on top
which I just love favorite out the
combination of the moment I realized I
didn't catch up with you yesterday
evening when I got back from the facial
but let me just tell you it was heavenly
it was just the most pampering relaxing
experience
I love liselle product so having them
applied in such a wonderful way was
gorgeous she also mixed the super skin
oil with the cleansing polish and they
just made it such a pleasurable
cleansing experience she said it's a
really good thing to do after a long day
in the city just to really deep clean
and also hydrate the skin and then she
also did some steaming and then
extraction which is where they get all
the nasty blackheads and things like
that out I could actually hear the
blackheads like bursting out sorry
thoughts 200 information but it was very
very satisfying and then just lots of
massaging a little bit of like back and
neck massage so yes I need to make that
a priority to do it far more regularly
this year and then Oh actually before I
went into Zara homes I'm gonna quickly
show you what I got from Zara home ok so
a mini Zara home haul for you these are
all kind of dining table things because
Charlie know I've been having a lot more
dinner parties lately and I just wanted
to get some really nice you know bits
and bobs for the table so the first
thing that I got were these 4 placemats
there are these big circle metallic
placemats I thought that if there's only
4 people at the dinner party then we
literally uses as placemats and puts the
plates on them but if there are more
than four people we can use them in the
middle of the table for putting serving
dishes on and they're a really beautiful
kind of rose gold color so I thought
they were really lovely and then I got a
selection of placemats these are kind of
like a rose gold metal I thought that
was really beautiful I think I have six
of these in total and then on the odd
occasion that we have eight people
around for dinner including Charlie and
I I also bought two of these I thought
it'd be quite nice to have these two
different ones on either end of the
table and these are much easier to wash
as well I got eight so two packs of four
of these linen napkins
I find that linen napkins they're just
really easy to wash and obviously you
don't have so much wastage and recycling
issues with paper napkins so yeah I got
two sets of those so eight in total and
then the same kind of material I got a
table runner I personally don't like the
look of an all-over tablecloth I think
that's bit old-fashioned but a long
linen runner down the middle of the
table I think looks so nice so I got the
matching one of those and finally I got
this picture frame it's got a really
nice gold border I thought that was
really pretty and shiny and I have lots
of pictures for my engagement so I'd
like to pop one of those in that I did
also nip into Primark yesterday morning
before the facial and I just picked up
loads of coat hangers and cotton pads
but not very exciting definitely not
enough to do a Primark haul so that's
what I bought yesterday and I'm heading
out shortly for my first meeting of the
day just waiting for the builders to
arrive so I can let them in and then
heading out for the day
Oh
so a couple of hours later had a few
meetings it's afternoon and as you can
see I'm now with a very special guest I
met Katie we've been just catching up to
the past half an hour and I finally met
her sweet little baby we now come to all
scars parade going to it's the launch
lovely karolina taro good girl program
hello again
so it's a few hours later and I have
just checked in to the Mandrake hotel
where I'm spending the evening as a
guest of Vichy so be sure launching a
new I think is a night cream slash mask
called the slow age and we're going to
find out all about it in a presentation
shortly I just had a lovely shower just
about to start getting ready for dinner
choosing my outfits so looking forward
to having a nice chilled evening a bit
of a staycation home away from home the
Mandrake hotel itself is only about four
months old and I've not even walked past
it before not even seen it let alone
stepped inside before from what I saw
downstairs it looks really lovely it is
of course already dark but I will show
you what it looks like in the morning
but this is my room a really lovely
spacious room that the bathroom is
really cute too let me show you that and
then this is why we're here this is the
new launch slow aged meat or if I say in
a French accent slower I guess and
they've actually given me five of these
and these are all to give away to you
guys so what I think I'm going to do is
do a tweet where it's like retweet to
win and then I'm gonna pick five of you
at random to win them so if you would
like to try this out then I'll leave the
tweet linked down below so just retweet
it and make sure you're following me and
you can win your very own slow wash wait
just finish getting ready super quick
outfit of the evening apologies about
the low
lighting but as I mentioned I'm wearing
my tory burch Roenick aka most versatile
piece ever
and then my Reese skirt which I have
again been wearing absolutely loads
these are kind of my to go to pieces at
the moment and then these are my Karen
Millen gray boots once again one of the
most worn pieces in my wardrobe so just
a combination of all of my favorite
things and then I'm going to be taking
with me my Aspinall trunk bag which I
absolutely adore I feel like this just
completes every outfit and makes it look
so chic so I'm just waiting for the
lovely end come and knock on my door and
then we're heading up
good morning it's now Thursday a little
bit echo eggs in the bathroom but we
have finally had hot water fixed we've
been without hot water since about
October which you may know if you've
been watching regularly that's life and
like showering at the gym all the time
but we finally had our boiler fixed so
I'm gonna have the path to end all baths
today and just start my morning off in a
really relaxing way we just did a
workout still in my workout gear but I
thought I would share with you my
bathing routine for today so I'm gonna
have a bit of a bit of a conversation
and I'm gonna use locks tones lavender
foaming bath gel I just absolutely love
that and then I'm going to use the locks
of turn
exfoliating paste this is more of like a
pampering exfoliation and a mega body
scrub because it's a little bit more
creamy I'm going to enjoy using it that
I'm going to pop on a face mask while
the bath is running and I'm going to use
the fresh Umbreon clay this is like my
go-to when I just want have the skin
detox and I feel like my skin needs that
having not thoroughly cleansed in a long
time and then my hair is in need of
toning so I'm going to use my TIGI Bed
Head this is the fashion estrange in the
dumb blonde it's a purple toning
shampoo and I find that it makes my
haircut that so beautiful kind of ashy
creamy color and then normally I would
mix that with a matching conditioner but
I found this one in my cupboard it's
just as good as cold
devoted to hue from a brand called a
nice tile on I'm gonna use this up I've
only got like one use left in this so
I'm gonna use that up leave that on for
5 to 10 minutes to do even more toning
and then when my face mask is off I'm
gonna pamper my skin with the one and
only LMS Pro College and the cleansing
balm so I'm feeling utterly pampered and
fabulous after my bath so I shall see
you shortly
hello again feeling so much better now
that I've had the most pampering bath
experience I cannot even tell you how
long I have waited for a nice hot bath
but I just had a delivery from Amazon
it's actually Amazon fashioned and I
thought I would share it with you
because I've actually never shopped for
fashion things on Amazon before but my
mum sent me an email a couple of days
ago and she was like oh Joey I've
accidentally ordered a coast jumper and
it's gonna come to you and by the way
you paid for it because it was on my
account and I was like okay fine
but then it made me check Amazon for
fashion and I've got some really good
pieces and they were a lot cheaper than
what you would expect so sometimes
they're the same as high street prices
sometimes with some of the brands
they're actually way less so for example
I've already opened up a couple of the
boxes I got this bracelet from Michael
Kors
and I've had my eye on this for so long
it looks really similar to a brand
called carrot London which is super
expensive it's like a gold bracelet with
this style of toggle
and it's got the stars along the front
section of it it's kind of a little bit
like Monica vinegar with the style of
the toggle but I just I'd fallen in love
with it when I saw it on the website and
it was about 20% off on Amazon so got a
nice little bargain there I also reward
the same coast jumper that my mum got
you may remember me wearing this last
year and I have emptied out all of my
like winter stuff from the loft and I
cannot find this jumper and I used to
wear it so much my mum now has it as
well so she loves it too so I thought
you know what it's a little bit cheaper
than it was in the high street I'm gonna
rebuy it because I absolutely love it
and I miss it it's a really nice high
neck it's a really nice soft material
super high neck and then it's got this
diamond detail around the neckline it's
just so snuggly so practical and it also
looks really nice with high-waisted
skirts like midi skirts too because it's
quite a smart jumper so I picked that
one up it's no longer in stock on coasts
so amazing the Amazon fashion had it and
then while I was on the coast page
because it's quite confusing like they
have loads of brands some of them I just
I'm not interested in that's all some of
the products are a little bit you know
not my style but the fact that you can
separate it by brands was really good so
while I was on the coast section I saw
another jumper this one I think was
called the ROS jumper it's got this
embroidery lace detail on the sleeves
and it's got it's kind of like fluted
material at the bottom and then this
beautiful pleated material on the back I
thought that was absolutely gorgeous and
once again no longer available on the
high street then I ordered from a
different brand brand I've not heard of
before this pajama set I'm always
looking out for dupes of the Silk aliyev
and health jamás I actually find that
cheaper material like more of a satin
material it's actually better for like
living in than silk because you don't
have to iron it every time and that's
exactly what this material is but it
looks identical to the aliyev and health
armors this is almost like a lighter key
pink I think the camera is making you
look a bit more pink than it is it's
slightly more lilac but I just love this
style of pyjama you've got the white
piping around the hems on the sleeves
right white piping around the collar and
down this middle button section here I
think these are going to look just as
beautiful as my aliyev on how pajamas
when I wear them
and they were I think in the 20 pound
region so very impressed with that and
then it's got the matching full-length
bottoms as well with the elasticated
waist band really really chuffed with
those and then you are going to really
laugh and think I'm so strange
for this next purchase but I bought a
pair of what can only be described as
Bridget Jones Spanx underwear these are
from triumph and the reason why I got
these bare with me guys I wanted a pair
of giant knickers that would like hold
in my thermal tops because as you know I
wear thermals most days if not every
single day during the winter and
sometimes they roll up or sometimes I
just feel like you know they're not
sitting flat and if I'm wearing a skirt
or from wearing something quite body
fitting then I don't want my thermal to
be creating extra padding in unnecessary
area so I thought if I get a pair of
really high-waisted knickers then I can
kind of wear them over my other
underwear maybe maybe that's unnecessary
and use it to tuck in my thermal there
is logic to my madness
so yes I will keep you updated on my
granny nikka thermal trick and finally I
got a new pair of Nike trainers again
these were maybe like 20 or 30 pounds
cheaper than anywhere else that I saw on
the internet and I have been going to
gym a lot more lately as you guys know
so I thought about time I treated myself
some new trainers and these are the ones
that I've got I tend to go for really
neutral like black and gray shades and
these are quite similar to ones I've
already got but they're new so I really
liked those I've gone for they are the
Nike Free Runs I don't really know that
much about trainers it says free run
distance to if that means anything I
don't know I just got them because they
look nice and they look comfy so these
are my new trainers so those that I
picked up from Amazon fashion as you can
imagine because it's Amazon everything
arrived the next day I do have prime I
think it's about 80 pounds oh like
compared to a tous premier is very
expensive but I order so much off Amazon
I also ordered and if there are any
other bloggers watching then this is a
really good item where is it this is
silicone removable case for the canon
g7x that is what i'm vlogging on at the
moment the little black canon camera
that all pretty much 90% of youtubers
used for vlogging because it's amazing
but it breaks very very easily I was at
an event with my friend M Sheldon and
she had this on her camera I was like
what is that
and it's basically a protective case
silicones that's kind of stretchy for
the g7x
my camera is on the edge of breaking
like the lens the screen is about to
fall off so this was 12 pounds from
Amazon so highly recommend this I'll
leave this and all of these pieces link
down below but hopefully this is going
to be a bit of a savior when it comes to
keeping my camera alive hello my
darlings it is Sunday I did not do any
vlogging yesterday because it was
totally just a chillin and staying at
home day so apologies for that but I did
also edit the first part of this vlog
and I know it's already very long so I'm
sure that you don't mind missing out on
one single day today is Sunday and it's
been a very relaxed morning I have
filmed and edited two videos well okay
not so relaxed I have been very busy and
we're just getting the house ready now
we are cooking because mum and Charlie's
mom and dad and Charlie's sister and
choice grandparents are all coming over
for lunch so I've just curled my hair
uses steam pod today and just absolutely
love it this is a new jumper that I was
actually very kindly sent from French
Connection I always love their knitwear
it's just you know it's very wearable
but it's also got a lot of style points
I like the fact that this has got
three-quarter sleeves I did joke to my
mum that I feel like a giant roll of
absorbent kitchen rolled because of the
bubbles on this and then on my wrist
here I have got some new Monica vintage
jewelry this is from their new launch of
their Fiji collection I'm doing some
shoots with this for the blog so I'm
borrowing this for a little while
absolutely love them and then just my
anthropology leggings super soft they've
got like a brushed fur lining so very
snugly and then my EMU slippers so that
is what I'm wearing today for our Sunday
lunch so I don't think there's anything
- exciting other than a load of our
family coming over and eating that's
going to happen today so I thought that

Sunday's outfit I'm gonna end the vlog
so I really hope you enjoyed coming
along with me this week or their Paris
and of London bit of home time a real
mixture so give this video a thumbs up
if you enjoyed it and leave the word
bubble like the bubbles on my top down
in the comments if you got to the very
end as I can see who your wonderful
darlings are but I'm sure you watch all
the way through to the end
so really hope you enjoyed it and I'll
see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
