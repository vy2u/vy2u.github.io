we're here to be reward style conference
which immediately goes along - we didn't
vlog in LA or I just lock in LA just
feel kind of being real tourists we were
doing all the stuff that Charlie's never
done before the Hollywood Walk the same
and we're just enjoying every moment and
I didn't really fancy picking up the
camera so I hope you guys don't mind I
am going to do some blog post on LA
though so yeah check those out but we're
in downtown Dallas at the moment we flew
in from LA last night about three hour
journey and we just have a lovely
breakfast at a place called threesome
social which is really really nice very
Instagram as you can see around me and
we're going to do the lips shopping now
we're going to check out downtown area
and then the reward style conference
kicks off this afternoon so so I went to
log bring you guys along with me I know
a lot of you guys with also bloggers and

affiliate company that I use for the
links down below so if you buy anything

with like SEO and just tips on how to
work with brands so I'm going to
hopefully share a lot of those tips with
you guys in this vlog so it should be
quite useful one but for now let's go
explore downtown Dallas
so it turns out that downtown Dallas is
a bit of a strange place there wasn't
that much going on there I'm not too
many shop there was a Neiman Marcus
Allen labo and not too much else so
we've actually come out can we give it
10 minute over and we've come to a place
with West Park with Ivan's village if I
got that wrong I'll leave it on the
screen somewhere but as you see a lot
more going on here it's like a little
out of town outdoor shopping center
which seems to be a lot more popular
than actual shopping streets here in the
US so that's I'm not complaining we
found a Chanel is Ralph Lauren we're
going to have to look around first we
went to Starbucks trying out the
legendary unicorn a Frappuccino which
actually matched our youtube today
hey I'm a top server let's give it a go
I mean it's kind of very funny
I mean it's not that it's very sweet I
thought it would taste a lot more Inari
there's no coffee right things up yeah
so before we do any shopping I'm going
to quickly show you my outfit of thing
I turned my head and hold it high but
it's making me shiver he's not like you
don't want it to get more like the river
and we were longing to you in the
picture I know this but the last taken
we like a notice the focus
while hotel for a quick change after
shopping and we've now got to the main
hotel where the reward toppings
it's working very like to know at random
choice sequence and photos of someone
like Noah fqb
user likes over there so let's get
inside and check
I did precisely zero logging out of your
party

but no I'm not I'm not different so
Jamie Charlie and I girl we're going to
head to a context tex-mex apparently
contain teeth and Vine recommended by
one of you guys with us so let's go and
check it out so we're about to embark on
Charlie's first ever process

amazing have Lepidus be consoling
good morning so it's day two of the
revolt our conference exactly to staff
and lunch times I have been to manic
take the camera out before now so the
day started like standing by busy
variables not a good idea
so the day started with some very
inspirational presentations and talks
from guys from the reward cell teams and
some brands well just really like
reiterating and the power of what style
of art influences what brands are
looking for so I definitely took way too
many knows I could not even begin it to
even reach the surface of what they
pulled up this morning well if you're
going to do is write a few blog post on
like tips or things I fixed up while
here so if I bring any of them by now

cute so yeah we're going to spend
another 25 minutes or so here and then
head back to the hotel and more meetings

have left the madness of the bumble
party and we've come to a place that
we've been highly recommended by local
girls called the Dolce Riviera

behind the truck of that so we've got
some stumble back into that later on yes

collaborators we would sell the

partying and now we are hungry
