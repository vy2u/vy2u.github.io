start to this week's weekly outfit
diaries video because today's bit of a
pampering day it is
Sophie's Hindu this week we're going to
look there we go and we're going to
Valencia on Thursday morning so I'm
doing some pre travel pampering at
starting off with a LVL or SPS SES
latter treatment with new lashes today
so I'm going to show you my lashes
before you can barely even see them and
I will show you if I'm allowed I'll show
you a bit of the process and I will show
you how fabulous they look afterwards so
I just want to be really comfortable for
that treatment because you're lying down
for a good hour and a half so I'm just
wearing this lovely silk t-shirt this is
from meat &amp;amp; M and it's just a very
lovely classic top trousers are my Kate
Spade ones that I got in the sale and I
adore and then I've gone for my Nicolas
Kirkwood flat shoes because I have to
run some errands in town afterwards and
I've got my lovely little Espanola box
bag it's actually the first time I'm
properly taking this out so looking
forward to giving it its debut and then
I'm also taking saris open and very
messy my big singer on bucket bag which
will have my laptop and stuff in okay
i've super quickly just put some very
loose curls in my hair the steam pod but
just before i go major
before lash close up this is not really
very flattering i have Monday morning
eye bags but yeah this is how nude my
lashes looked before and now let's flick
it after and my lashes are done as you
can see they're looking a lot more bold
they just look up see fabulous I had the
SPS treatment which is speed holy
so they look fabulous with or without
makeup I will show you them in a bit
more detail when I get home I've just
got some Liberty you're going to do a
little bit of shopping and have it fall
around learn some of the history so I'll
take you along with me and then we'll
catch up later
the display are you even a broker to
deliver to flower store
so and we are having some canapes these
are the most insane canapes I've ever
seen and cocktails at the Langham the
cocktails are inspired by moments from
your youth mine is reminds you of your
childhood so it tastes a little bit like
taste like Calpol but in a really good
way Sophie's actually is more fragrant
and it smells like dusty classrooms
sounds crazy but they are absolutely
delicious apples mango - Rose and we are
in the beautiful artesian bar at
my new favorite place in London
okie-dokie is the couple of hours later
I had a lovely little shopping trip
slash tour of Liberty really good fun
thanks so much
I didn't realize all the wood in the
store is from one of the old or a couple
of old ships so that's why it's so
unique all the little details on the
word all original details from the ship
it is I think you know one of the only
department stores with a royal warrant
and yeah I've just learnt so much about
the brands that they stock there they
very kindly gifted me a pair of the
Liberty Prince silk pajamas which is
very very generous of them we're now at
the Langham
I'm with so who's looking gorgeous
although she says she looks gathered in
her glasses but they look very very chic
I think you wish I'd gotten glasses
we've just had some drinks at their
artesian bar and the drinks were all
inspired I don't have to hear me talk to
Molly oh they're all inspired by
childhood memories mine was like a rose
and milk banana cocktail meant to remind
you of your school days and we're going
to now head out so cool yard they're
having a bit late summer party gonna
have some Prosecco and sunshine
good morning darlings so it is now
Wednesday today is starting off in a
very relaxing way and might be deklay or
boutique on Westbourne Grove such a
beautiful area around here and I'm about
to have a fabulous relaxing
anti-pollution facial experience with
the lovely Nicola job we're going to try
out lots of new products and it's going
to be a very relaxing hours of video and
on all the details afterwards the
beautiful space in the boutique Nicola
is preparing everything over there so I
will see you I hope you can hear me over
the traffic noise but I'm just on my way
home after an incredibly fabulous facial
experience so
gave me a facial fight unlike anything
I've ever had before
facial massage so actually instead of it
being all about the relaxation while it
was relaxing it was more about
stimulating the muscles and like phase
she was explaining all the benefits of
regular facial massage she's even given
me some little routines to do at home to
help with puffiness around the eyes to
help with headaches lymphatic drainage I
learnt a lot during the facial he also
used her signature massage routine
before the anti-pollution product and at
the very same massage routine at that
she used mega Markel on her wedding day
morning there's interesting to hear a
lot more about Megyn skin care and
facial massage
whilst I'm probably gonna do in either
this vlog or another one is show you a
few of these massage routines we
what nikola was also saying was about
how it's really important to do things
like this to your skin that as opposed
to getting Botox getting
because this is a natural way of getting
some very useful as you can see I'm
glowing and what's going on that's
because Muslims in my face it has never
been stimulated before since the whole
new experience but I will show you some
of the master routines when I next you
might see you
yep on my way home now and I'm gonna be
packing at four safes handy
back home again now I'm not sure if you
could hear anything that I was saying in
the taxi but I was explaining all about
how lovely the facial was and happening
was all about niccola's special massage
technique she has this anti-pollution
technique as well using of course tech
leo's anti-pollution products which just
feels amazing my skin's got such a nice
glow so hopefully this will last
throughout the Hindu I'll be definitely
putting in to practice the massage
techniques you're showing me so back
home now I did buy a few things in town
as well which are in my bag here so I'm
going to try on these pieces with some
things from my wardrobe and also you
went to dawdle so I have my Topshop
order I did the other day so I'm gonna
have a rummage shoot all these pieces
plan at my outfits because we're there
for three days I need to plan my looks
which day this is the suitcase half flat
the moment this side that's packed is
filled with basically all the liquids
for all of us girls I packed all the
shampoos cleansers moisturizers hair
sprays fake tans etc because the other
girls are just taking hand luggage so
I'm the dedicated liquid lady and yeah
I'm gonna plan out my outfits do a big
tidy up session and I'll catch up with
you in a little bit
you gotta smile make the Sun rise to
make it shine
but I can see that you don't be
and that's one day
Oh
I'll get you
but I can see that you don't
hello my darlings so it is now Sunday
I'm back in the UK after Sophie's
fabulous hen due in Valencia we had an
amazing couple of days with all the
girls really really good fun I think so
if you had a great time as well it was
my first proper hen do and yeah it was
just really really fabulous so many
amazing memories all the girls were so
it's so nice I really switched off as
well didn't do any work which is very
rare normally when I go on holiday I'm
still working but this time I really
really switched off so I'm not sure if
you'll have seen any clips just now or
if we've just gone from UK clipper to UK
clip apologies if so but yeah on someone
else's hem do you really want to be
filming your outfit Diaries so I thought
what I would do is if you do want to see
more about hen do we're going to do some
stuff on the be my pride channel so stay
tuned to that if you want to see we see
what we got up to on the Hindu but I
didn't want to be throwing a camera in
everyone's face old times so didn't vlog
it too much or at all my own channel but
I thought they'd be nice to show you
guys what I wore so what I'm gonna do
now is just quickly unpack my suitcase
and I'm going to show you some of my
favorite outfits from the trip because I
did wear some really cute things and I
thought it'd be fun to show you in case
you have any trips coming up any
holidays and your weekend breaks so yes
let me show you what I wore in Valencia
so this is the outfit that I wore last
night and last night we went on a lovely
sunset boat cruise and we went out for
dinner so I wore you might recognize
this outfit because this is in my spring
outfit lookbook it is my Topshop top
which I still absolutely love I think
there are a few sizes left so definitely
be speedy if you want to get a hold of
this one the trousers are not the River
Island ones are in the lookbook however
these ones are from Topshop and I think
I actually prefer them they have this
amazing broderie panel going down the
side which you can see really carry
there and then footwear wise I have worn
this on the floor so nice Footwear wise
I have gone for these roughly sandals
that look very very similar in fact
almost identical to my Kate Spade
sandals but these ones are actually from
Topshop so a lot cheaper really good
dupes actually and there are some other
designers
I was looking on far fetch this morning
that are doing these ruffled sandals so
I think it must be a big trend at the
moment but the heel is a chunky block
heel so they were fine even considering
that we were on a boat and these were
one of only three pairs of shoes that I
took with me so I did get a lot of wear
out of these as I mentioned before this
top I love wearing it with high-waisted
trousers so these are perfect if the
river island ones are sold out which I
think they are then these aren't new in
so I'll leave them linked down below but
yeah absolutely loved wearing this
outfit so this is what I wore last night
this amazing little jumpsuit is just so
so pretty I actually didn't wear this so
which I'm gutted about because I went to
put this on last night but we had a PI
year making cast in the day yesterday
and I felt so bloated that I just
couldn't couldn't pull myself into it
with that in mind I would say if you're
between sizes with this one I would
definitely recommend sizing up but on a
slightly less bloated day and I don't
feel anywhere near so bad now I almost
definitely be wearing this probably in
the UK and also on any other upcoming
trips that I've got it's just a really
really beautiful lightweight material
that love the floral pattern it's got
this not quite even as higher at the
sides and it is in the middle
floaty hem on the trousers and then this
little cold shoulder detail it did come
with a belt as well like a chain belt
but I wasn't a big fan of that so I
might find a little rose gold chain belt
to wear with this so this one again I'll
leave linked down in the description
books I had actually been humming and
hawing about keeping this little dress
from riffled but I'm so glad I did keep
it this is actually one of my favorite
things that I wore in Valencia
so is this gorgeous little coral dress
super super bright I think this color
makes you look so much more tanned the
neckline as well I think is really
flattering it the lace just goes it's
like half sheer and half lined and I
think it's really flattering how it goes
over the skin with this little eyelash
detail if you were to wear a bit of a
push together bra it could be quite sexy
and boobie as well but I just wore a
normal bra it's very waist cinching you
do have to be careful or mindful that
your bra is going to show the sides so
maybe invest in a nice little pretty one
or choose your underwear carefully but
yeah I love the color of this I love
for bit it is quite short for me but I
think for a little summer dress it's
really really pretty it is quite an
expensive one I didn't actually realize
before recently how expensive revolve is
but I'm determined to get a lot of wear
out of it so yeah this one kind of took
me by surprise to be one of my favorite
outfits next up is this all
Zara outfit which you may recognize if
you watched my Zara haul this is what I
wore on day two when we went to the
beach club we went to this amazing Beach
Club called I think it was literally
called Marina Beach Club but if you ever
go to Valencia I would highly recommend
this place it was on Marina juan-carlos
which is basically the main beach in
Valencia we had and we had a fantastic
lunch there and it was really well
priced as well we had lovely starters
mains and lots of rows a sangria and I
think it came to like under $20 a person
so definitely recommend that place I had
this lovely little two piece number from
Zara on which I think looks very similar
ish loads and ruffles lots of lovely
floral detail the ruffle it is actually
a top and a skirt but then the florals
match absolute perfectly so it does look
like a little dress or little place suit
I actually wore flip-flops on this day
but I thought it looked better with the
heels so I kept those on to show you but
yeah this is fairly recent from Zara so
how do you recommend a visit there very
soon unsurprisingly I did also take my
Kate Spade dress which is my favourite
dress in my wardrobe at the moment I
wore this on our first evening and it
still smells like toughies
we ate so much amazing tapas in Valencia
and yeah this is what I wore on the
first night it was perfect because it's
just such a pretty dress so many lovely
bright colors great for wearing on
holiday I wore it with the Kate Spade
bucket bag and the shoes which look like
the Kate Spade shoes obviously since I
last spoke about this dress which was in
my what's new my wardrobe video we've
had the very very sad news about the
founder of the Kate Spade brand Kate
Spade herself committing suicide and
it's just such such awful news I think
everyone was so shocked and it just
proves that money and
success doesn't equal happiness and I'm
so touched by the amount of you guys
actually reached out and sent and
sympathies to me because you knew how
much of a fan of the Kate Spade brand I
am and that's never going to change case
wait actually didn't own the brand
hasn't owned the brand for a few years
now she sold it to Neiman Marcus but she
changed fashion especially in America
she was one of the first craters of one
of the first eight bags
she really bought color and bold designs
into style and that's something that I
will always be grateful for she had such
a huge impact on fashion and the trends
that we wear today and yeah I can't
pretend that I wasn't really upset this
week I was very affected by it so thank
you to all of you that sent lovely
messages so I wore this dress in honor
of the amazing late Kate Spade so there
we go that was another dress that I wore
in Valencia here we have another lovely
colorful little number this one is from
Topshop I really loved the Bardot
neckline of this one I think again very
Valencian Valencian a sort of thing
luncheon not sure but yeah really lovely
fun and lightweight dress from Topshop
with his fill neckline button detail
going through the center you could undo
a little more if you wanted it to be a
bit shorter but I left them all done up
it's got a pink lining which is really
effective if you kind of get a little
glimpse of that full length you guys
asked me my height quite a lot I'm
afraid I haven't got a clue I would say
I'm probably about 5'4 I'm not right at
all but I do cut things and shorten any
hems of things a little bit too long for
me but to be honest I find if I go with
petite items I don't usually have that
problem I am wearing heels with this
dress the Topshop heels again it would
probably be touching the floor if I
didn't wear the heels but with these
shoes it is the absolute perfect length
and then this is my final outfit and
this was the outfit that I wore on our
second evening that was evening that we
went out to a club there's this really
cool Club in Valencia called lumbrical
and it's basically in this in fact I'm
gonna insert photo of the club here it's
like this open almost like a rib cage
structure a really crazy it's in the
science city or through there Cynthia
Cynthia Euler I'm not sure in Valencia
and it's all open air aside from this
like metal structure at the top of it as
palm trees inside we somehow managed to
get into the VIP area don't know how
that happened and granny over here
stayed up partying until about half-past
four in the morning it was amazing and
that was the night where Sofie wore
white she had her sash she had a veil
and the rest of us Balazs wore dark
colors so I have as you know a very
light colored wardrobe but this dress
from Ted Baker was absolutely perfect
it's Navy pleated skirt I'm not sure if
this is still on line I will have a look
but yeah this is Ted Baker I featured on
my Instagram a million times when I
first got it
it's got this floral detail at the top
it is a silky material so I didn't get
too hot absolutely loved wearing this
and again I wore it with my top top
shoes so these shoes went with a lot of
my outfits found them very very
comfortable so those were my outfits of
Valencia so those were my outfits for
our trip to Valencia who you enjoyed my
little casual way of showing you those
I'm gonna just finish unpacking now and
have a big glass of water cause I'm
really really thirsty it took me so long
to get home took me longer to get from
London Luton Airport to Katherine than
it did to get from our Airbnb in
Valencia to London Luton that's how much
traffic that was today I think there was
some marches in London and we were stuck
in the same place for nearly an hour and
yeah I was fooling the taxi for good
three hours and charlie'd ordered an
honest burger so I had actually two
burgers when I got in so that's pretty
why I'm feeling very thirsty so I'm
gonna get myself ready to get myself
pampered I'm going to take my gel nails
off because they are nearly totally
outgrown other than you could see that
my camera is very broken when it comes
to focusing and I'm gonna end the vlog
here because tomorrow is Monday so that
means a new weekly vlog and next week
I've got lots of fun things planned so
I'm excited to show you that so stay
tuned next week but yeah hope you
enjoyed this vlog if you did enjoy it
