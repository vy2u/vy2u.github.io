vlog or outfit Diaries video it's
Tuesday today I didn't start the vlog
off yesterday because I was at home
doing nothing wearing a very very sloppy
outfit so I didn't think it would be a
good way to start an outfit of the week
video this is a much much better place
to start I am here at the Savoy Hotel
again I feel so lucky to have been here
twice in the space of a month this is
actually my first time staying overnight
here though which I'm so so excited
about I'm going to give you a little
room tour in a second because we are
saying in the most beautiful room
feeling very very lucky and then of
course I will show you my outfit of the
day so today is actually a really really
fun day to start off the vlog because
I'm I was invited by Paul Edmonds which
as you know is where I got my hair
colored I was invited by them as they
are the official hair stylist of the
BAFTAs to join in this amazing BAFTA
nominee experience which is taking place
today so I will show you all the amazing
experiences that we get up to today but
first of all let me give you a quick
room tour ok so you come in and
immediately you've got this little
bathroom here but this is not the only
bathroom that's just like a little
entrance area this is the main living
room space of the room this is one of
their Riverview Suites you've got a desk
and like a little mini library beautiful
fireplace huge TV over there so so
gorgeous on the table they've left us
some cute little treats I've got a trio
of cupcakes here with our Instagram
photos one this is our engagement
picture and then these are two photos
that we actually took in the Royal Suite
last time we were here I've got a little
welcome note and also some goodies from
Lancome I'm going to open these up later
and some goodies from Paul Edmonds as
well but yeah I'm gonna save these until
a little bit later on so I've got a
meeting to head off to in a second the
most amazing amazing view from the suite
the London Eye over there the houses of
parliament
I think Big Ben is probably just around
there this would have been the most
incredible place to watch the fireworks
on New Year's Eve and then round here we
have two little dog beds because my
babies are going to be joining us later
and then this is the actual bedroom
seriously spectacular look at this oh my
goodness it's such a beautiful room in
my suitcase this is a new one from Ted
Baker and I absolutely love it
another little desk area and then we
have a wardrobe and the bathroom so
we've got a double sink area I think
Charlie will be very pleased to see that
they have Malabo toiletries that's his
absolute favorite and then oh my
goodness I am so excited to have a bath
in here later we've not had hot water in
our house for ages now so I've bought
some bath salts and I'm definitely gonna
have a lovely relax in the tub later I'm
gonna quickly show you my outfit of the
day here just in case I don't get chance
to show you later as well
so the jumper that I'm wearing is one
that I actually got in the Kate Spade
sale you might have spotted it in my
sale video which went live last week
really love that and then I've got my
usual wrist jewelry I'm Monica Fernanda
bracelets engagement ring this is the
first outfit diary video I've filmed
since the engagement so this is a new
addition obviously 12 bits Michael Kors
watch and then this is a skirt from Club
Monaco that I got maybe about a year ago
but really really love this it's like a
kind of tweed material and then these
aren't my new Stuart Weitzman boots they
are Highline boots also got them in the
sale so yes I absolutely love this and
then I'm going to wearing my Kate Spade
coat aside
Oh
later now I've just had my first meeting
of the day and I've been picked up in
this fabulous
howdy very snazzy this is my ride for
the day it's the new Audi a8 it's got a
little touchpad just green here that I
can control everything from my heat
seating to what's on the radio very
snazzy indeed now I'm heading to
Mandarin Oriental where I'm actually
gonna have lunch with Paul Edmonds I'm
gonna be quizzing him about all things
hair he is the official hair partner of
the BAFTA so I'm finding out lots about
his involvement with that as well we've
actually just arrived that was super
quick so I'll catch up with you later
just got back to the comforts of my
fabulous suite after what has been the
most incredible day and it's not even
over yet I've got a pampering makeover
with Lancome in a second and then dinner
here at the Savoy which I'm very much
looking forward to but since I last
spoke to you so I had my meeting and
then I headed to the Mandarin Oriental
had a lovely lunch there with Paul
Edmonds I got to quiz him about his very
long history in the film industry
obviously the BAFTA nominations were
announced this morning and Paul is ill
has been a judge for the BAFTAs for the
past five or six years this year is his
first year being the official hair
partner hence my amazing hair experience
in the Sun on just earlier I've got my
hair pinned up in a bun at the moment
but I will reveal the amazing curls
later it was as always a wonderful
experience and the salon had a lovely
blow-dry I just absolutely loved it
there it's totally totally luxurious
always an amazing amazing experience but
yeah so over lunch he was telling me all
about his career right from the early
stages when he was just invited to help
out on various films he then did some
training for traditional barber services
for the BBC he has worked with so many
amazing Hollywood actors and actresses
this morning he was doing Joanna
Lumley's hair for the BAFTA nominations
so when it comes to TV and film hair
there really is no one better at down
and Paul Edmunds so it's quite quite an
honour to have lunch with him today and
discuss all of that he also gave you
some tips my own hair and some tips on
how to get candle wax out of puppy ears
because Dexter has been getting a little
bit too close to the fire recently but
yeah really really fabulous day and even
better being chauffeur driven around in
that amazing Audi so yeah I've really
wonderful start to the week charlie is
on his way to the hotel now with the
boys I'm looking forward to seeing them
I've just ordered a cappuccino from the
room service from my Butler this room
has its own Butler which is crazy so I'm
just gonna enjoy that have a bit of a
chill and then get ready for dinner
just
a lovely bath and now my three favorite
boys have come to join me I've got
little Dexy little chicky nunu my nikki
is here and then Charles over there
currently not wearing very much clothing
so I am about to head down to the
Lancome suite now
Lancome are the official makeup partners
of the BAFTAs and they're going to do
something fabulous with my face ready
for dinner and cocktails later on what
do you think of your luxury
accommodation my boys its we love it
can't wait for that study I can't avoid
I've just changed into a very relaxed
outfit to head up to get my makeup done
so this is a cute little jumper it's a
very nice loose fit with this almost
like plat detail down the sides this is
from River Island and then I've got my
Kate Spade trousers on at these I
absolutely love and I've worn them so
much since I got them also got them in
the sale and my little Reece mules which
are my favorite shoes and these also
went down in the sale I think they only
have a size 3 left but I will even make
down below just
just got back after my makeup
appointment with Lancome and I think
this is my favorite that my makeup has
ever ever looked this base is so glowy
and so pretty I love this lipstick and
this eyebrow cream as well so beautiful
so feeling very very glamorous I'm going
to let my hair down get dressed and then
it's time for dinner so this is my
finished look for this evening ready for
our cocktails and dinner feeling very
very glam for a contused a evening I'll
get Charlie to show you a quick outfit
of the day and outfit of the night to my
third outfit change today but I'm
wearing a dress which actually I wore
this dress on Christmas Day it's from
Ted Baker yeah I thought this is a
Christmas Day dress and thought tonight
would be a nice opportunity to wear it
again and then obviously my blow-dry has
been done by the amazing
Paul Edmonds team so I went for some
waves which we created with the blow
dryer and then pinned them up on my head
during the salon and then they kind of
continued setting while I have my hair
in a bun so these should last a good
amount of time very voluminous color
looking amazing as well so yes Charlie's
looking very smart too puppies are
currently charging around the room like
mad animals but yeah let me show you my
final little feed
by tipsy night-night my big boy
night-night Dickie see you in the
morning when should open do you like
your comfy beds on the subway yes hi
boys see you in the morning
good morning so it's actually now Friday
I haven't vlogged for the past couple of
days but I have still filmed my outfit
so you guys all have seen what I wore
actually I kind of wore the same thing
both Wednesday and Thursday but then I
also was shooting some new content
yesterday with the lovely cat I'm
working on a little project with Ted
Baker as you can guess by the huge Ted
Baker bag behind me so shot that
yesterday and then came home and just
relaxed in my casual wear which I'm
wearing now I also have been feeling a
hundred percent great the past couple of
days I don't know if I've maybe overdone
it a bit in the gym but I've been
getting a real pain around my ribs like
especially on the left hand side all
around like here and then all the way
around the back as well really weird but
when I kind of go hard in the gym
I'm almost doubling over in pain when I
breathe afterwards the following
afternoon and next morning so it's not
been very fun I haven't been mega like
on it with the vlogs so apologies for
the sudden jump although when I edit it
never really seems like a jump I could
probably just pretend that's the next
day and you guys would never be any the
wiser but yes it's Friday today Fridays
I nearly always work from home because
that's just what I like to do so I'm
wearing casual wear again today I went
to gym this morning but actually ended
up just doing some stretches and having
a really nice long shower in the gym
that was nice I'm getting my nails and a
pedicure done later today and my
favorites London grace so I'll take you
along to that but I'm just gonna be
working downstairs by the fire for the
rest of the day also going to toddle
later on it's not going to do a bit of a
blogger man unboxing for you to just
give this vlog a little bit more content
because it's not going to be outfit
focused this week but yeah be back on
track next week hopefully with lots of
normal outfit Diaries content so for now
downstairs breakfast time and then I'll
do some pure box opening later on
okay so I've just got back from getting
my nails done Oh beautiful
that's my favorite look at Grace I went
for a light pink called cashmere wrap
which i think is really beautiful
classic shade just got home and
collected our blogger mail from Dajjal
so as promised I'm going to show you a
few of my new in p.o box pieces his
first blogger mail is from Dior and I've
actually seen this being unboxed on a
few bloggers life follows instagram
stories so this is going to be I think
they're new they're called the new lip
glows and I believe they are a really
lovely barmy new lip product so it
sounds like exactly the kind of thing
that you need in winter so I'm looking
forward to giving these a try so but
it's beautiful that little box or the
pink ribbon wrapped around it really
lovely packaging so the box we have got
the four shades of the lip glow I have
to say this packaging is absolutely
beautiful like a translucent pink tube
with lip glow written on it oh my gosh
look at that color so beautiful my lips
are already craving this these are
actually new additions to the existing
lip glow collection I've just applied
101 which is a matte pink shade so it's
like a bomb but it's still mattified if
that's kind of heavy for fur and there's
also this one has a sparkly sticker on
it this is called a holographic pink I
believe lip glow zero one zero in holo
pink which looks absolutely amazing it's
more of like a more of a traditional
bomb a little bit of glitter in there as
well so nice snazzy upgrade to your
usual lip balm also a slightly deeper
kind of a fuchsia pink that looks like
my perfect kind of Beach lip product
it's more of a coral color this is what
I like to apply on some holidays it's
pop it in your beach bag and it keeps
your lips nice and moisturized while
you're in the Sun and even more intense
pink but this one does look quite sheer
so it's probably going to be the most
barmy of the selection there's a lovely
start fabulous blogger melt from a Dior
and keep those girlies are sending those
next up we have got a little
and here let's go look this is going to
be we have two new products from
Charlotte Tilbury I've actually wanted
to try this for so long this is the
overnight bronze &amp;amp; Glow mask because as
you might be able to tell I'm losing my
tan very very quickly and I've heard
really good things about this and then
this is the healthy glow all year
hydrating summit in town Dacian I really
wanted to try this for going to the gym
I like to wear lighter foundations to
the gym and this is I think the
Charlotte Tilbury option at the moment
I'm using the by Terry CC cream so
hopefully this might be a good
alternative for that because I am very
close to running out I'll keep you
posted so I had a good bag here from Eve
LOM and inside was a slab of marble
which will actually come in really handy
for flat layers and their new radiance
face oil this came at a really good time
so actually chucked out my Liz Earle
nighttime face oil yesterday because it
been open for a really long time I only
had a little bit left so this is an
intensely hydrating oil in rich with
antioxidants quickly absorbs into your
skin I love using oils in the evening
and the eve LOM skincare that I've tried
before I've absolutely loved so that I'm
very much looking forward to trying it
thank you very much to Eve lon
and for the handy marble board - AHA
this next one is from Giorgio Armani I
have got all the most amazing brands in
today's blog amount this is their
essence in foundation cushion that
sounds amazing it sounds like they've
got a cushion foundation with a bit more
skin care in it and it's personalized
look how cute that is how adorable is
that so this is a pretty big actually
foundation cushion compact how do you
get in there so inside the first layer
you've got this big mirror in the lid a
sponge
George Online sponge and then after a
few taps I'm getting the color through
oh that is gorgeous oh my goodness well
I have to say on first impressions that
seems absolutely gorgeous perhaps a
little bit pale for me at the moment I
do have some fake tan on but nothing a
bit of bronzer can't help with the
perfect balance between tailor-made bill
courage and a light no makeup sensation
they are my secret lies in the essence
delivers 18 hours of nourishment has SPF
23 and this is out on the 24th of
January that's fifty nine pounds so I'm
gonna think I might do a new in video
maybe try some of these out a little bit
longer so I can give more in depth first
impressions let me know that's kind of
thing that you would like to see because
I might start doing those each month
yeah it's my Kate Spade order I ordered
so much stuff from the Kate Spade
website and here it is I think I'm going
to do a whole video showing you what I
bought in January very soon so I'm not
going to show you this just yet
this next one is from Weller SP stand
professional I mentioned their Lux hair
oil in my 2017 beauty favorites 2018 is
the year to re-energize a grapefruit and
mimosa scented candle not haircare
surprisingly but a lovely gift
nonetheless so with will weather system
professional you can generate your own
energy code and find out exactly what
your hair needs I actually worked at
them but as last year the year before on
a little campaign about the energy code
and it literally finds the exact perfect
hair products for your particular hair
type so definitely recommend checking
that out and they've popped in a very
handy little desk calendar as well so
it's a lovely little bundle from Wella
just a couple more and we have some
spring makeup launches from Clarins
looks like they've got some new of their
instant lip balm perfectors which I love
and and also this collection of primers
I have actually already been lucky
enough to try a few of these they have
bought out a whole host of primers and
they each have a different benefit of
different skin concerns so this one
visibly minimizes dark spots this one is
for blurring imperfections we've got one
for minimizing the signs of fatigue and
then also we have the new lip balm
protectors I just have always loved
these I featured them in so many of my
favorites before looks like a lovely
bright vivid new pink shade look at that
these are also just amazing for a
handbag at this time of year little bit
of a bit of moisture and a beautiful pop
of color
big fan of those this one is more of a
plum color deep purple again if you like
to have more of a statement darker lip
be still on that Barbie feeling then
that's the one to go for this next one
is from it cosmetics and they are
launching their first three steps
skincare routine here in the UK so I
think a lot of it is anti-aging this is
a transforming a moisturizer super cream
we have got illuminating repairing eye
cream this is a their color correcting
CC cream I don't think I've ever
actually had a full sized one of these
but the mini I have in my handbag and I
love it so I'm very thankful to finally
get a full-size one and then this is
confidence in a cleanser this says
anti-aging skin transforming hydrating
cleansing serum cleansing serum that
sounds interesting and then they've also
popped in the giving keys as a couple of
gifts in here the giving keys embrace
your word and then pay it forward to a
person that feels and needs the message
more than you so that's interesting
so my giving key is confidence so I
guess you have to pass this on to
someone that you feel needs a little bit
of confidence that's a really really
lovely idea and then also we have a
20-18 and make it happen
diary very very handy for this time of
year I think I'll probably use this for
my videos scheduling it's got some
really nice big calendar pages so I can
see my monthly videos all in one page
yeah this is really really handy
officially my new video diary and last
but not least I have a few new goodies
from pi skincare so they have kindly
sent me their aah a mask for a deep
cleanse I've heard really really good
things about this and I think this is
one of their best sellers so that's I
think I'm gonna go tonight we've also
got the perfect balanced blemish serum
really need this at the moment I've got
loads of like under skin spots so I'll
be giving it that's the world and again
I think this is where they're
bestsellers rosehip by a generator oil
with omega 3 6 7 &amp;amp; 9 love the sound of
that and I've not tried that much from
pie before so I'm looking forward to
discovering a new brand I will as always
keep you updated as to my thoughts so
that's today's a blogger mail I hope you

lovely new pieces with me I will catch
