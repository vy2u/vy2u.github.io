something new from me over the course of
a week I decided to film a few short
clips of my outfit and then compiled
them in a sort of what I wore this week
videos I really hope you like it
we're kicking off with one of my go-to
outfits for summer in the city days
these crazy pattern houses are a little
out there for me but I am obsessed the
colors are amazing and they are so comfy
and I get tons of compliments when I
wear them soon I will this outfit to
Wimbledon and they in London to meetings
- oh as with all my videos every single
thing I'm wearing will be linked in the
description box
this white top is absolutely gorgeous I
love the peplum hem detail and Yeti
straps are great for showing up at am
real or fake can we also just take a
moment to appreciate this bag I have
worn it so much this week unbelievably
it was a very kind gift from Hawaiian
Tropic as part of a mail out to this
Brown SPF which I was obsessed with but
the pom-poms the initials I just
absolutely love it I will link this one
and some more affordable ones down below
next up is a dress that I have in my
wardrobe for months without wearing now
I adore it and love the other shoulder
detail and it's huge voluminous skirts I
work for a lovely dinner with Charlie
last week and note these shoes are not
my 300 pounds - it white someone's
they're actually 20 pound in hoops I
have got so much work
you
now we're at Wimbledon and on this day I
was there as a guest of kin melon so no
surprises as to where my gorgeous
dresses from I have a few favorites from
the other moments but this one was so
perfect for the tennis championship my
favorite bag appears again and I turned
to look down my favorite flap which are
currently in the sale for 15 pounds
alright so here's something a little bit
different my gym outfit I like to wear
something colorful when I work out and
these are my favorite cropped leggings I
got the trainer's last week and I love
them the pink stripe is very cute and I
find the gray really really wearable I
put my workout essentials in this Chloe
cubes backpack and I usually shield my
makeup free phase with giant sunglasses
also not come forward to these adduced
as well below
finally an outfit that I wore to a
blogger event
I love these slick trousers and the top
is also a new favorite the bag is the
perfect size all my essentials and I
styled with my usual jewelry my shoes
are gorgeous trees ones from a little
while ago in postal in stock they will
be linked or if not I'll find similar so
that's it so I really hope you enjoyed
this video and I'll see you in a next
wonderful science</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
