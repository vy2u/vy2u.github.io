the final pay day until Christmas today
which can only mean one thing it is
Black Friday and Cyber weekend so a lot
of us are going to be doing lots of
shopping this weekend and I thought it
would be very useful for me to share
with you a bit of an edit of my favorite
discounts and the things that I think
are really worth splurging on it is very
easy to go quite crazy quite overboard
so hopefully you'll find this edit
really useful there's a few new things
in here and also some bits that I have
been wearing lots over the past few
weeks and months that are on discount
today so before I get started I want to
let you know that I have done a chai
Norma's blog post over on my blog
fashion manga comm I have listed all of
my favorite retailers and their sales
and also some special discount codes
which sometimes are not even on display
on the website so definitely bookmark my
blog post send it to your friends and
your family and it hopefully will make
your Black Friday and Cyber weekend
shopping a lot easier I will leave that
blog post linked down below and also
throughout today and the weekend I'm
going to be sharing a lot of my favorite
bargains over on my Instagram stories
and Twitter so make sure you're also
following me over there so first of all
I'm going to share with you a few pieces
that are already in my wardrobe but
today have gone on sale for Black Friday
and these are pieces I think that you
guys really really love first of all
Aspinall and astronaut brand that you
don't really expect go on sale but today
they are doing 20% of the entire website
this is my newest bag from Aspen all you
may have seen it in my unboxing video
and it is the Dockery bag and it is such
a stunning bag by buying it in the sales
day you're saving over 160 pounds so
definitely a fantastic time to buy this
one I also have the trunk bag which you
guys absolutely loved I wore throughout
the summer
I will leave both of these bags and the
link to the discount site down in the
description box
there's Nexen I think you guys are going
to be really really excited about it is
Karen Millen and the gray over knee
boots life and wearing so much in New
York here in London everywhere I go I
have been wearing these boots they are
definitely my most worn item of the
season so far
they are 25% off at the moment I feel
like they will probably sell out very
soon before the weekend is out so don't
hang around I would recommend these so
so so much Incred
be comfortable they make so many outfits
look great they go with so many outfits
which I'll know it have you been
watching my latest vlogs and videos so
yeah it's 25% off the entire site on can
melon and also the camel coat that I've
been wearing so many beautiful things to
invest in and now is the time
ASOS currently have 20% off the entire
website today which for me was a really
good excuse to treat myself to not only
a few bits of clothing but also some
bits that I had on my wish list for
gifts for Christmas clothing wise of
course I love ASOS own brand but also I
really think it's a great place to shop
for branded pieces the fact that they
have such a good delivery service means
that I much rather buy pieces from there
than the retailer directly in many cases
I picked up this Jack Wills jumper in
the sale 20% off it is the most
beautiful soft material is such a
classic piece baby pink so the kind of
thing that I know that I'll wear a lot
75 pounds 20% off I'm not going to do
the maths but it definitely made it much
more affordable as I said I use today as
an excuse to pick up some of the gifts
that I'm going to be using as stocking
fillers I'm not going to show you too
many in case the people who have bought
them for a watching but I pick this one
up as a stocking filler for Charlie as a
blogger boyfriend he takes that very
seriously and I've got him this which is
the men's society camera and lens
cleaning kit the air source gift section
I think is such a great place to check
for stocking fillers so this is one of
the ones that I picked up today using
the discount I will leave a link to this
and a few of my other favorite gift
ideas down in the description box Kate
Spade is another brand that you'll have
seen me wearing a lot recently and again
today they have 20% off the whole site
which is very very exciting this is one
of my favorite bags it is the velvet
crossbody bag I will this a lot in New
York and it's a beautiful bag for the
party season I know I'll be getting a
lot more wear out of this over the
coming weeks and months as well as that
one the baby it's cold outside tote bag
is also 20% off and you guys are loving
this bag so so so much and again what
better day to buy it then today when it
is on such a fantastic special offer
this one gets so much stuff inside at
the moment I have got my laptop in there
as well as so many other bits and pieces
such a practical bag and a really good
price and now that it is in the Black
Friday sale and then also from a Kate
Spade a lot of
you were lusting over this coat when I
featured it on my Instagram and in my
New York outfit Diaries this one also is
from Kate Spade so today is a fabulous
day to pick this one up with a 20%
discount so those I would say on my top
three favorite things from that Kate
Spade next a couple of pieces that I
actually picked up myself in the Black
Friday sales and these are from Ted
Baker Ted Baker have a very generous 30%
off today which is absolutely incredible
I've had this bag on my wish list for a
little while it is the Ted Baker camera
bag beautiful light pink brownie color
and it's that kind of leather that's not
really going to scratch it's quite a
versatile and practical leather rose
gold details I just adore the details in
tobacco products it's got a rose gold
strap rose gold zip and then inside
they'll definitely be room enough for my
vlogging camera my iPhone my makeup all
those bits and bobs I would say this is
the same size as you Gucci Soho disco
bag and that's definitely the vibe that
I was going for when I picked this one
up I'd also been thinking about this
coat for so long so when I saw it was in
the sale I had to pick it up this one I
actually was lusting over the version of
this last year which was a slightly
different color combination
this year it's a almost lilac II grey
shade and then you've got a light pink
faux fur down at the bottom I think this
is going to be one of those coats I
reach for time and time again for things
like Christmas parties festive
gatherings over a lovely dress and once
again it's got those really fun Ted
Baker details you've got the bow lining
you've got the rose gold hook rose gold
hooks to catch it down the middle here
just a really beautiful coat and you
know when you've been lusting over
something for so long and it finally
goes into sale it feels like it was
meant to be so that's what happened for
me with this one I will leave these
specific pieces and a link to the
general 30% off website down in the
description box so don't forget to check
out to that for links to more things I
picked up in my Ted Baker Hall firstly a
black jumper as you may know from my
Instagram I have been starting to wear
black a lot more lately I never really
wore it before because I don't feel like
it hugely suits me but I thought this is
a really lovely festive and feminine
jumper with the bow detail on the
shoulder and then you've got metallic
flecks running through it I also picked
up this dress which I'm planning on
wearing during our holiday we're going
to the Maldives next month and this I
think will be perfect for there's
slightly more glamorous evening
on the beach and with this diamante
detail just gives it a little bit of a
festive vibe as well okay let's talk
about Topshop because they have got an
incredible Black Friday sale on today
they have up to 50% off hundreds and
hundreds of pieces and I've chosen a few
of my absolute favorites to share with
you first of all this dress so I will a
dress similar to this in the summer
which is more purpley and it totally
sold out it was so popular such a
beautiful dress this is the new version
of that it's got more of a velvety
material it's just such a perfect winter
dress this is a great layering piece
it's one of those pieces that's just an
instant outfit
and I absolutely love it this is one of
the pieces that is very reduced in the
sale today as well as the dress this
coat is also in the sale this is the
piece I've been IMing and hiring about
for quite a long time and I feel like
it's really great to get statement
pieces in the sale because you don't you
don't necessarily want to spend a huge
load of money on something that is a
little bit more bright a little bit more
statements in case you don't find
yourself wearing it that much you know
it's quite a risky purchase perhaps so
treating yourself them in the sale is a
really good idea in my opinion so this
is a really lovely long very warm woolen
coat from Topshop one of the most highly
discounted pieces on the website as well
so really thrilled to have picked that
one up in at the sale and then I'm so
pleased that these are going to sale you
guys are going to absolutely love these
these are the Chloe Susannah dupes I
mentioned these in a video a couple of
weeks back and they have gone down to 30
pounds down from 45 pounds they are such
a good price really good quality and in
my opinion the best dupes of the Chloe
Susannah boots I absolutely adore them
an autumn wardrobe staple so now is
definitely the time to pick up a pair of
these boots so I really don't want to
forget about the best accessories in the
Black Friday sale today so I'm going to
talk about those next first of all miss
Ouma and you guys will probably know
this brand mostly for their horn
necklace which is this one here there is
not a blogger under the Sun that does
not own this necklace and for good
reason is absolutely stunning a classic
design it really elevates an outfit
whether that's a white t-shirt or even I
like to wear it with a bikini is
incredible quality 25% off the entire
website today and I feel like this one
will be selling out very very quickly so
next up is one of my most worn jewelry
pieces of all time and is my Monica
Villa de Riva ring this is down in the
Black Friday sale they've got a
selection of pieces that up to 30% off
definitely the time to pick this one up
I'm really surprised to see such a
classic piece going down in the sale but
I'm very very thankful that it is I know
a lot of you have got this on your
Christmas wish lists so I would
definitely send them the link over this
today it's likely to sell out because it
is such a lust worthy piece but yeah I
thought you guys would love to know that
it is in the Black Friday sales today
another one of my absolute favorite
jewelry brands is Astrid mui where their
earrings nearly all the time this ring
as well you guys know is one of my
favorites they have got 25% off the
entire website which is absolutely
incredible
makes the pieces even more affordable i
think they are such good value for how
beautiful and long-lasting and how
classic the designs are so i'll leave a
link to a few of my favorites down below
and you'll also spot them in the blog
post as i mentioned as well next we have
river island and they have got 30
percent off the entire website today
when you spend 75 pounds or more this is
a piece that i've picked up very
recently you'll have seen me wearing
this in the Cotswolds over on instagram
and i absolutely adore it this got so
many compliments everybody wanting to
know where it was from and they were so
surprised when i told him it was a high
street piece in river island it looks so
much more luxurious this is just a
classic winter coat so treat us after
this today and get 30% off also of
course my gray over knee boots
if the Karen Mellon ones are still a
little bit over budget than these ones
were 75 pounds but again you can get
these in 30% off today I absolutely
adore these they are a little bit tight
around the leg so do size up if you are
between sizes pointer toe just so
classic and elegant so I definitely
definitely recommend picking these up to
date while you can save yourself at 30%
you guys have also spotted my new watch
in quite a lot of my videos it is the
Michael Kors access SmartWatch I am in
love with this watch I could not
recommend it enough I recommend it to
everybody that asks me about it when I
go for meetings or catch up with friends
for me is just such a beautiful
accessory and it's very very practical
with the amount of tech that it has in
there the watch and the entire Michael
Kors website is 20% off today so a
really good time to either treat
yourself to this or treat a loved one to
this I honestly could not recommend this
enough and again perfect time to treat
yourself another retailer that has 20%
off the entire website is the white
company this is a new
treat that I picked up from the white
company and it is their cashmere robe
I love having something really luxurious
to lounge around the house in during
these cold months and it is a premium
and definitely quite an expensive piece
so making the most out of that 20% off
offer is definitely a really good idea I
did actually do an entire blog post all
about gifting from the white company
there's so many beautiful things you can
pick up Christmas presents whether
that's things like classic picture
frames all those incredible at winter
candles that they have I'll also leave
that blog post linked down below but
today 20% of the entire website if you
are thinking of something ultra
luxurious like this then I would
recommend doing so today another new
piece in my wardrobe which is really fun
I haven't had the chance to show you
guys yet but I'm sure you'll love it as
much as I do
it is this scarf from coast it has these
pom-poms on it which are just so fun so
cute and coast is up to 40% off today so
a really good day to have a little spurt
on there if you like coasters one that
you may not automatically think to shop
at some people think of it still just as
a place for occasion where they have so
many gorgeous pieces I would definitely
recommend checking out their Black
Friday sale today as well my favorite
gym leggings are also in the sweaty
Betty sale today these ones are my
classic black ones they've got a little
bit of like a grey mottled design on
them I think that investing in gym wear
is a really good idea it really kind of
motivates me to get my butt to the gym
and 20 percent off the whole sweaty
Betty website is amazing in my opinion
these my absolute favorites you guys
have seen on my Instagram stories my
vlogs I pretty much only wear sweaty
Betty to the gym so today's a really
good day to invest in maybe some new
sports bras or new tank tops another
couple of pieces that I wear all the
time I have this like aubergine colored
sports bra I love that it doesn't have
the removable padding so when you put it
in the washing machine you don't have to
worry about like sorting out afterwards
but it definitely keeps everything in
place and then I have this light pink
top which I wear over the top of my
sports bra it's just quite a
loose-fitting vest very flattering I
find it doesn't make me too overly hot a
really beautiful piece and all of those
everything on the whole website is 20%
off if you're getting some ski thermals
as well today would be a very good time
to do so and then of course there are so
many beauty discounts as well brands
like deklay or they have 25% offer and
website boots have got some amazing
deals look fantastic I've got some
amazing deals but as I mentioned all of
those are going to be written out linked
with all the discount codes and
everything over on my blog so that's a
really good place to start if you just
want to have everything written out all
in front of you so that you can make the
best decisions on where to save yourself
some money this Black Friday also
electronics Charlie and I just bought
ourselves a new Dyson Wireless Hoover
this morning from John Lewis hashtag
adult problems so yeah it's a great time
to save yourself a little bit of money I
really hope that this video has been
useful I hope this gives you a chance to
save a little bit of money on some bits
that have been on your wish list and I'd
love to know what you guys are thinking
of cheating yourself to this Black
Friday if you've made any real Steel's
and definitely let me know I'm also
thinking of doing a whole video on
Sunday or Monday of the things that I've
bought myself using the amazing
discounts about today so let me know if
that's something that you would like to
see and don't forget keep an eye on my
Instagram stories because I'm going to
