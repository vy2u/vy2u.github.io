channel today is Tuesday and it is the
first day of Royal Ascot today and I
thought to celebrate the occasion I
would share with you seven dresses or
seven outfits to wear to the races
of course these outfits coming worn from
loads of different summer events if
you're going so I've got a knot or a
skirts perfect symmetrical and while
you're going to vine a skirt or if it's
any races I know this claiming races of
another country seems like Wimbledon and
birthday parties
some of these could be appropriate for
weddings so basically any summer event
that requires you to be a little bit
more dressed up if you have been through
my channel before you will know that I
love getting dressed up so it's really
fun two things don't dress up to share
with you guys so I'm also going to be
sharing with you a few accessories I've
paired with them price 20 wide these
goes from around 45 pounds addresses all
the way up to nearly the 200-pound mark
that hopefully there's done for a few
different budgets and some not quite a
full sort as well and what we're going
to be sharing with you a few tips on how
to wear them as well as whether the
particular dresses are dear to the rule
for the boring enclosure because as you
may know at word outfit now I've been
very strict dress code rules for going
to Royal Enclosure but also let you know
whether these dresses are appropriate or
that one off so without further ado
let's get started
okay so this is the first dress and
probably my favorite first of all though
I have to apologize for the quality of
this video I didn't notice this until I
started editing I think the heat have
got to my camera anyway this dress I
just absolutely adore I have been
wearing it very much recently just as a
day dress and I'm trying on wearing it
to some lovely events it's a beautiful
broderie anglaise style with pockets
hallelujah a beautiful bow on the waist
and the fit is just absolute stunning I
really love this square neckline as well
it's very chic and yeah love it love it
love it great investment piece this one
is a little bit more classic elegant and
ladylike it's a beautiful blush pink
color I just love the lace detail on the
sleeves it's a very elegant length as
well perfect for Royal Enclosure at
Ascot because it's got more than two
inches on the shoulders which is what
you need and a very elegant length too i
have paired those with a lovely blush
pink bag keeping the color palette
really neutral and simple and then you
can also add maybe an embellished jacket
like I have them here this just also
absolutely from the 45 pounds so really
good bargain and yeah just look so
lovely with some accessories like these
ones this next dress is a real statement
piece it wouldn't work for the Royal
Enclosure because of the very thin
spaghetti strap but lengthwise again
really beautiful can take a moment to
appreciate these shoes they are limited
edition to my trade though Jimmy Choos
absolutely love them but the asymmetric
the neckline on this is what I
absolutely adore this is the moment that
I realized I was actually wearing it
wrong and you should actually put your
arm through the frill like this so this
is how you're meant to wear it but yeah
in love this giant frill detail along
the neckline of this dress and I think
it's so timeless with a beautiful white
material another classic style this is
the beautiful pink and white lace I've
paired it with these shoes which I don't
mind so much recently I think they're
around 45 pounds great because they've
got such a thick heel so they won't get
stuck in any grass or mud beautiful
little pink handbag
it's really essential for the close up
of the lace just so beautiful and very
very feminine
this is probably one of my favorites
definitely do not wear this to any
weddings but if you're going to make any
birthday parties summer barbecues this
is gorgeous I would say to size up with
this I got a size six and it's a little
bit on the tight side I just love all
this tool netting it's just so floaty
perfect for summer days and just look at
all that detail nice and affordable as
well under the hundred pound mark this
one is a real statement piece this would
be a great one for weddings or again any
summer garden parties grapes the races
great Wimbledon things like that I love
the color as well beautiful fresh lemon
sorbet shade and I've dressed it up a
little bit with my Valentino but as this
one again under a hundred pounds links
to everything else always down in the
description box what should I wear I
think I will the same revine and one
with this this one's a bit more casual
it's got the beautiful leather jeans
he'll run down the middle and on the
waistline this one could definitely be
worn more as a day dress and it's got
some beautiful embroidery detail
I made it even more casual with some
mule shoes but you could also maybe put
on some stilettos or witches to dress it
up and I've added an embellished clutch
bag which will also be linked down below
and on within everything it so it's
backless which I really like keeps you
nice and cool on summer days and then
wow this one is a toxin exposure and
something available on the high street
with these Manolo dukes which were about
45 pounds I think love the detail on
this dress really lovely length would
work for the Royal Enclosure as well I
put it with a fascinator just to make it
even more appropriate for the races so
here are some clips of me being really
silly while we're filming because I
think the heat definite got to my brain
but thank you for watching let me know
which is your favorite in the comments
section below and I'll see you next time
thanks so much for watching oh god I am
such Donald Spice
