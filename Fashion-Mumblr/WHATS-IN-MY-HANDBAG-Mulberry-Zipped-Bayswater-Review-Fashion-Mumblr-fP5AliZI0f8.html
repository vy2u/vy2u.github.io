joining me for today's video it's going
to be a what's in my handbag video today
and I'm going to be sharing with you
what is inside my beautiful mulberry
zipped Bayswater bag I'm filming this
video on my vlogging camera so sorry
that we don't have a beautifully blurred
out background and but actually I'm not
gonna lie I quite like it I don't have
any lighting setup at the moment I just
put my camera on a tripod and started
filming so let me know what you think of
the last professional set up down below
hopefully you don't mind but I think
it's really good for this video because
I'm not so zoomed in and I can show you
this in all its glory
so this Homburg I've had for a couple of
weeks now and I have been using it as my
everyday handbag it's just the most
practical versatile fabulous bag in the
whole world
mulberry is a brand in general that I
absolutely adore I used to work at
mulberry a long time ago just as I was
finishing my time at the London College
of Fashion and also my first ever
designer bag was a mulberry Bayswater
very similar to this one but the five or
six year old style
I always think they're so beautifully
crafted and you get so much use out of
them because the designs really are
beautifully classic so this particular
handbag I really wanted an everyday bag
something that had a zip at the top
which this one does so that when I'm
commuting in London I don't need to
worry about anyone sneakily putting that
hand in my handbag and something that
was really really stylish but they would
fit all of my essentials when I go out
and about I often have a big camera with
me or at least a camera of types my
laptop with me my charger sometimes I
have dog things with me like collars
harnesses that kind of thing so actually
as much as I adore small handbags I
really do need a big bag I very often go
out with a big bag and a smaller one if
I'm doing photos and throughout the
winter months I was wearing my Kate
Spade baby it's cold outside bag but
that is quite a casual bag it is more of
a felt material so I did want something
a little bit smarter that could be used
in my everyday handbag so that is where
this baby comes in the name of the
leather colour
I can't remember exactly I want to say
like lush or Rose or something along
those lines so it's not quite brown is a
slight pinky tinge to it which is
another reason why I absolutely adore it
sorry the shape was looking a little bit
strange there you do have on the front
this detail of the classic mulberry
postman lock you can open it and close
it but it doesn't actually do anything
so I normally just leave mine closed and
then you just have this big zip section
in the middle which I open up to reveal
some time done all of my things inside
now this is gonna be a very real what's
in my handbag this is literally what I
carry around on a day-to-day basis so
I'm gonna get started with the larger
things and the first thing in here I'm
gonna pop the bag down in front of me
the first thing in my handbag is this
water bottle you might have seen this in
a blogger man a boxing this was sent to
me by the PR for Neal's Yard remedies
and they are advertising the fact that
you can fill up your refillable water
bottle in their stores this is from a
brand that I cannot remember the name of
every sorry but I will link it down
below so I did find them online and it
is a holistic hydration brand so as you
can probably see there is a crystal in
here this is I want to say an amethyst I
really want to learn a lot more about
crystals if you have any tips or any
books or podcasts and please leave them
down below but this I think is for
calming or balancing your energy I
really love that idea I'm really open
minded to that kind of thing and
secretly really love it so I want to do
some more research on that but I think
it's a really beautiful water bottle it
has this little cooler slash protector
in there and this is one that I have in
my handbag for everyday slurping the
next large thing in my handbag is my
laptop I have got the macbook i think
it's just called a macbook and in pink
of course or rose gold whatever you want
to call it and then i've got a gold
marble case i just keep the front of it
on this is a really super affordable one
from a company called coconut lane this
is a charlotte tilbury sticker which I
got from a plugger male and I just
thought it was quite nice to put that on
there and the case yeah really
affordable and they have a discount code
that I will leave linked down below and
on the screen and then
think that saves you like fifteen or
twenty percent so yeah that's a really
lovely one again a lot of questions
about my last up case the main reason
why I wanted a bag this big was so that
it would fit my laptop and a lot more
bits and bobs in there as well
this laptop obviously fits in there an
absolute dream there's still tons of
room in the handbag so great for those
days when I'm out and about and working
between meetings okie dokie so the next
thing I have is my phone and this was
out and about but I just slung it in
here for the sake of the video I've got
the iPhone 7 plus and the only thing
that's different about it is I have this
pop socket on the back
I kept so many questions about this I
can't believe how many people don't know
what a pop socket is basically for me
it's great because it means that I don't
drop my phone seven pluses or eight
pluses are pretty big so if you've got
little hands like me it just makes it a
lot easier when it comes to texting or
typing doing emails because yeah you're
not going to drop it if you're slotted
into your pop socket it also means that
I can prop it up it acts as a bit of a
balancing module so if I want to watch
videos while I'm IMing or do my makeup
or whatever don't know why ironing came
first to mind but yeah it's really good
for that so that is my telephone I have
then got a couple okay so I've got a
notebook here this is my it's just a
little Kate Spade notebook really flimsy
one very good for just popping in the
handbag I'm a serial note-taker at
meetings at pres breakfast things like
that I love taking notes so in here I've
got loads of to-do lists I love writing
to-do lists edits avoid log edit gift
guide is obviously pre-christmas blog
posts to write things to shoot in the
maldives video ideas oh and then I have
this list here sneaky sneaky peek and
this is kind of me using the secret
slash organizing in my head is basically
a list of fashion and beauty brands that
I want to work with in 2018 so I've
written a list of my favorite beauty
brands and my favorite fashion brands
and I want to just kind of tick it off
when I work with these brands so for
example this year I really want to be a
lot more strict with myself and only
work with the brands like absolutely
absolute you love I always say no to
collaborating with brands and I do
love but this year I want to streamline
my collaborations even more so that's my
little list my checklist if you will and
you have more to-do list things to shoot
to-do lists bla bla bla so yeah all of
that good stuff is in my little Kate
Spade notebook and then this other thing
this is the bed and breakfast little
green book 2018 this if you like to
travel around the UK is pretty much a
Bible it lists all the best bed and
breakfast it's like kind of like a
directory of BM B's we went up to
Lincoln to visit my family a couple of
weekends ago and we found a B&amp;amp;B from
this it has a section on dog friendly BN
B's so yeah we've never had a bad B&amp;amp;B
from this book so that was in there as
well next up we have my makeup bags I
feel like this could be quite fun to go
through the bag itself is a YSL bag it
says YSL Beauty love on there just a
plain black bag really good size nice
and light weights for in the handbag
it's quite full we've got lots of bits
and bobs in here the first thing is the
dream skin perfect skin cushion
foundation from Dior I love to have a
cushion foundation with me I think
they're really good too topping up in
the day this one is my current favorite
I've taken out and sponge because I
never use that this one has a great
mirror in the lid and then underneath
you have got the foundation as I said
it's really lightweight it almost feels
like skin care built into the foundation
I often find during the afternoon that
my makeup has vanished from my chin
often my cheeks as well so it's really
great to be able to top that up with
this if I'm getting a little bit shiny I
will reach for these this is my Fenty
beauty little handy roller which
contains tissues that are like blotting
paper so look so you just rip out the
amount that you need it's often like
here that I get a little bit oily and
this just blots any oil away without
adding loads of cakey makeup that's
really handy then I have got a fragrance
this is the
misty or rollable pearl fragrance
amazing for keeping in the handbag such
a lovely size its the blooming bouquet
fragrance and as you can see rollable so
just really easy when you're on the go
to just add a touch of lovely fragrance
it's a really nice spring fresh
fragrance as well so big fan of that one
I have another fragrance in here as well
this is a little mini Viktor and Rolf
flower bomb I love that scent sometimes
you just want to dab a little bit here
and there so that's great okay I have
quite a few lip balm e products in here
I'm a huge fan of tinted lip balms this
is probably my longest standing favorite
and it is the girl and La Petite robe
Noire lip balm it just gives a beautiful
delicate wash of subtle pink to the lips
and also really barmy another lip balm
is the Dior Addict lip glow the color
Reviver balm this I've got in the coral
shade so depending what outfit I'm
wearing or what shade I want on my lips
I'll reach for one of those too I have
three or possibly four invisi bubbles in
here I like the rose gold ones that's
what I have the most of and I find that
they blend in the best with my hair
color so I'm always I have this really
strange thing where I can't eat food
like a proper meal with my hair down so
I wouldn't be able to eat like this for
example I just I actually find my hair
really annoying and when I'm not filming
videos I always have my hair tied back
into a bun so you'll 99% of the time see
one of these on my wrists and photos
because chances are I had my hair in a
bun two seconds prior to taking the
photos they always have loads of
Invisibles with me this is a mini
foundation brush from Real Techniques I
think it's that buffing brush it's
called the expert face brush this is how
I apply my cushion foundation but
sometimes I don't even use this for
applying product sometimes I just blend
my face with it if I find I'm getting a
bit of a line down there or my makeup is
setting a bit and my under eye area I'll
just kind of buff the complexion with
this and it is a little mini one so
perfect for taking in your handbag I've
got a lipgloss in here too this one I
was wearing on Valentine's Day I tend to
throw in whatever lipstick I'm wearing
that day into my makeup bag I did have a
clear out fairly recently because as you
can imagine they do add up but I often
find my most recently used lip
products in my handbag this is the
bareMinerals gen nude lip gloss in the
shade Bay and for someone that doesn't
really like lip glosses I absolutely
love this one it's not gloopy your hair
doesn't get stuck to it doesn't feel
really sticky on the lips and it gives
them as beautiful color I'm going to
apply a little bit now I find that the
doe foot applicator also dispenses the
perfect amount so big fan of that one
from bareMinerals
I have another tinted lip balm in here
this is my by Terry this is probably my
favorite color on the lips it's called
nude issome o hyaluronic sheer Rouge so
this one actually has lots of extra
ingredients in there like hyaluronic
acid so it's slightly plumps the lips
and it also fills out any lines as well
as being a bomb so huge fan of that one
from by Terry and then we've got lots of
little knickknacks down at the bottom
this is actually a diamond brilliance
polishing cloth from De Beers as you may
know my engagement ring is being resized
at the moment it's taking a long time
because they're having to totally
rebuild it so it was three sizes too big
but I still have a polishing cloth in my
handbag I have quite a lot of these in
my bedside table and nice to have one in
case you get anything sticky on your
ring or if it just needs a bit of a buff
up then that's amazing so I have that in
my bag back to makeup I have the
Guerlain terracotta Jolly tom bronzer
this one I have in my handbag makeup bag
because it's so thin if I am doing my
makeup or topping up my makeup during
the day then I love to apply a little
bit more bronzer I don't feel like
myself without bronzer and this is the
bronzer that I love the most in the
smallest packaging so you've still got a
mirror in the lid and then it also has a
little bit of pink in there as well so
it could be a very subtle blush color
too and then the last few pieces I've
got a very neutral Urban Decay eye
shadow this is the urban decay laced
eyeshadow I don't often top my eyeshadow
out when I'm on the go but it's in there
anyway
I have a mini of the it cosmetics
mascara the superhero mascara really
handy size I got this when I went to the
COTS odds with them and it's a fabulous
mascara also from it cosmetics a little
mini of their CC cream amazing product
seriously multitasking so grateful ago
ooh a slightly bigger lipstick this is
the Shiseido desert quartz
yeah use your lipstick this is another
one that I've been wearing a lot
recently a really wearable pink shade
looks gorgeous with a lip liner one of
my favorites so that's another everyday
lipstick a broken Anastasia brow Wiz
benefit gimme brow loc love of color lip
crayon and then I also have this little
capsule of the Bobbi Brown foundation I
just threw this in as I was testing it
and thought it was really nifty little
size for keeping in my handbag and then
just a couple more invisible down at the
bottom there so these are all of the
goodies that I keep in my handbag makeup
bag as I said I do clear it out every
now and then and try and streamline it
but aside from the lipsticks most of
that stuff just stays in there all the
time okay moving on what else do we have
in my bag the next thing that I can see
still makeup related is my quarterly
beauty elixir this is a special limited
edition
it says same formula limited edition
bottles so it's a gold bottle and kind
of see a bit better there this is the
most fabulous thing to have in your
handbag if you get to three or four
o'clock in the afternoon and you just
want a bit of a pick-me-up if your
complexion is starting to get a little
bit dull or you just want something to
refresh your complexion or you're about
to redo your makeup this is amazing the
smell is just instantly uplifting it
does amazing things to the complexion
really just brightens and gives you
instant radiance sets makeup smells
amazing super refreshing I honestly
don't have a bad word to say about this
it's also a hundred percent natural so
you're not putting loaded chemicals on
your face I have quite a few of these
minis this one probably has another
week's worth left in it and then I have
a couple of big ones on my desk as well
so big fan of the beauty elixir I've got
a packet of Kleenex tissues in there
definitely need to have these in your
bag if you are a dog mama for various
reasons mostly actually because Dexter
gets quite carsick so yeah good to have
those in there just in case I've got my
little wallet this is from an American
brand no sorry an Australian brand
called the daily edited and it's just a
very cute little card folder I used to
have a big purse and then I have smaller
purse and now I just really use this
because I do swap to smaller hand bags
in the evenings or if I'm
dashing out so all of my essentials go
in here nothing too exciting to show you
just various credit cards driving
license and a few loyalty cards I've got
two different loyalty cards for farm
girl
I think I'm - I'm - stamps away from
getting a free coffee and then I
actually have two on the other one so
maybe I can trade that in for a coffee
some receipts this is a receipt actually
for our Valentine's Day dinner at Cafe
Monaco I got the dinner Charlie got the
theater tickets and nothing else very
exciting in that I'm gonna go quite
quickly through these last few pieces
you know how everyone just has random
bits at the bottom of that handbag so
I'm gonna go through them quite quickly
this is a dry shampoo mostly for the
occasions when I go to the gym and then
straight out to meetings
it's 100% vegan it's a brand called
Maria nila I wouldn't say it's as good
as batiste when it comes to actually
making your hair look super fresh and if
you like that powdery feel you don't
really get that from this but it does
freshen up the hair and make you more
acceptable after workout so that's in
there good little comeback size then I
have got in its own little sheath my pen
rose gold pen where the glitter in the
top a really really cute one for taking
notes at meetings and things like that
next is my handbag hairbrush this is a
little folder pair brush from the wet
brush although the wet brush is rubbing
off at the moment this is pretty much a
full-size hairbrush but the collapsible
version great for detangling
great for knots making your hair frizzy
so very important when you're on the go
then we've got my little charging block
this is a pearl charger a really cute
little battery pack at the moment I have
got four bars so it's fully ready to go
what is adorable about this is that it's
actually a mirror as well you can turn
on a light but a really good way of
having a mirror always in your handbag
because it's got your battery set I
should also have a little cable I think
I've got this from Primark this is a
really good cable because it goes into
the USB of your charger and then this
top it is an iPhone here and then you
know is that called like a thunderbolt
or an android charger which basically
means I can charge this and charge my
iPhone from the same cable so that's
really handy
other bits and bobs we have got my
sunglasses
feeling empty because I have my
sunglasses on my heads this morning to
go to the gym but I usually have my
leopard print Kate Spade sunglasses in
here I have got my willy derp
skin-food this I use as a hand cream but
it has so many other uses as well it's
an amazing hand cream really luxurious
but it doesn't feel greasy it doesn't
take ages to sink in but also if you
want to use it as a cuticle balm or if
you've got any cuts or any sunburn it
has so many different uses it's very
natural as well so you're not putting
loads chemicals on your skin which is
very very important
generally just an amazing product and I
know so many people are obsessed with
that for good reason another lip product
this is the girl Anne La Petite robe
Noire lip color ink in the shade I think
it's shade one one one this I think is
in my handbag from when we shot my
romantic lookbook I use this as part of
the intro for that but my house keys
nothing very exciting to report on here
and this keychain is a locks to time I
think it's locks at an for oh no Estee
Lauder for breast cancer keychain it's
got a few cute little charms on there
this I think I got with my breast cancer
advanced night repair lotion so that's
all that's on there oh actually and then
this one is a Marc Jacobs Daisy dream
keychain and this I keep on there
because I got this from my very first
blogger event it was the Marc Jacobs
Daisy dream pop up in con garden it was
the first event I ever went to I was so
thrilled to have got a free key chain at
the event so um that kind of just stays
on my keys for good memories last couple
of bits now um I actually have the
sponge from my do your compact after
telling you that I don't use it but
there it is in the bottom of my handbag
I have got an ASOS visitor pass so I
went for dinner with a sauce last week
and to go into that offices to visit
their showroom I had to sign in so
that's my visitor pass I have rather a
lot of tablets in the bottom of here as
well if you need a doctor come to me
I've got some LEM set day and night flu
relief capsules
I have ibuprofen
and Europe and then I have got some
earphones these are big live like
easyJet earphones in the bright orange
but they're actually Hugo Boss they were
in a goodie bag that Charlie had from a
Hugo Boss event so I've pinched those
then stuck together
this is a Garnier micellar water sachet
I tend to pull out sachets from
magazines I find them really handy for
putting in my gym bag so yeah I have a
little sachet who knew there were
sachets of micellar water so random but
it's a great product this is probably my
favorite mirror I don't know why I need
three mirrors in my handbag but it's a
big round mirror really great for
checking everything your makeup your
hair your outfit whatever it's so big
and this is Paul and Joe from ASOS I'll
leave this link down below because it's
such a practical thing to have and then
also the way that it opens it does stand
up on a flat surface as well so if you
want to do your makeup or when you're
traveling if you want to can even do
your hair with this because it is quite
a zoomed out mirror very very handy
another invisible a hair clip I often
just like clip back to the front section
of my hair again if I'm eating or
working I've got some extra spearmint
chewing gum I very rarely chew gum often
when I find it in the bottom my handbag
it's out of date and very gross I
thought this is a starburst but this is
actually a fruit teller
raspberry flavor and then some mints in
a tin so that is the main body of my
handbag absolutely empty but the last
couple of bits I've got are in the
envelope pocket so there's no zippy
pockets in here just a little slip and
blow pockets and then in there I have
another pen I think this is also from
coconut lane the same kind of marble
effect and then you've got the glitter
at the top there I have a Marc Jacobs
lipstick this is screen-test a nude
lipstick once again another one that
I've been wearing as like an everyday
lipstick recently so that's in there I'm
really surprised that there aren't any
lip liners in here because I often throw
in my daily lipstick and lip liner then
I've got this very useful device here if
you have the same laptop as me you'll
know that it only has a slot for the
charger and an earphone slots so there
means that I do have slots for my memory
cards and my USBs so really really handy
I have one of these in my desk at my
bedside table one in my handbag and
absolute essential if you have that
laptop and finally dun dun dun we have
got the mulberry oh so now I can tell
you the name of this color it is dark
blush this is just the little quality
guarantee thing zipped Bayswater small
classic grain in dark blush J 1 1 1 and
1 more pen I think this is a Swarovski
pen I tend to just chuck pens in the
bottom of my handbag this one is really
really beautiful it's white with rose
gold clip and then you've got the
Swarovski crystals around here and if
you can see that there is also a
Swarovski crystal in the lid there too
so there is everything that I have in my
mulberry Homburg my everyday bag I don't
think there's anything too surprising or
weird in there I'm trying to be quite
good at not just chucking loads of
random stuff in my handbags and with old
handbags I would always find that
there'd be crumbs I'm just really random
stuff at the bottom but this one no
crumbs no random bits and bobs at the
bottom I'm really trying to take care of
this beautiful beautiful handbag the bag
itself when it's empty is also really
lightweight which is something that's
very important to me I do carry a lot in
my bags as you've seen so the handbag
itself just cannot be heavy otherwise I
will not be able to manage it and this
is super super lightweight overall I
just absolutely adore this handbag it's
so perfect for all of my needs it looks
beautiful and I just adore it so so so
much so really hope you guys enjoyed
looking through what's in my handbag and
a kind of mini review I guess of the
mulberry zipped Bayswater let me know
what you think to this bag as well let
me know your thoughts and opinions and
also if you've got anything surprising
in your handbag have a little rummage
and let me know if you've got anything
weird and wonderful in there so that is
all from me I really hope you guys
