time we had a bit of a catch up and get
back into the swing of normal vlogs
because I've totally got out of the
habit of doing them since going away as
you probably know Charlie and I were
abroad for maybe like that very much as
a whole of April so my youtube schedule
has been all over the place but today
I'm gonna get back into the swing of
things
I'm gonna show you some unboxing very
shortly but I'm gonna put some makeup on
my face first I was just about to whiz
through it and do it normally but then I
thought that I would do it on camera and
also share with you some new launches
because I've had a few meetings of
brands lately and I've had some nice
blogger mail lately
so I thought I would show you a few
other pieces that are new to me and we
can do some first impressions and also
just catch up well I put them on my face
this is a girl on a Bay Royale B glow I
think this is a primer oh but first I
already put the Estee Lauder daywear
oil-free SPF 25 24 hour antioxidant
moisturizer this one here I put this one
on first this one is new to me but their
day wear range I think is kind of aimed
at Millennials it's good for just
keeping the skin going hydrated and it
also has antioxidants in there so great
fan to pollution so I thought I would
try that one out and it was really
lovely and light this I had a meeting
with the lovely girls from Galan
yesterday and they were saying that also
this helps to give the skin a lovely
healthy dewy glow it's a really
comfortable product to wear on top of
your moisturizer it's moisturizing
itself so you could get away with out
wearing moisturizer and they were saying
that it also helps to tighten the skin I
am getting to the point where I'm
getting a bit concerned with fine lines
around my eyes and I actually popped a
tiny bit of this on my hands yes and
during the meeting and pass it around
the eyes and you know when you just feel
instantly brighter and lifted it just
felt so so nice and having it all over
my skin now I can tell it just feels
really comfortable but also like you
know a little bit smoothed out which is
great if you're maybe late 20s and I'm
not quite late twenties but already
concerned with the fine lines
and then I still have not tried the
ordinary serum foundation and when I was
shopping in Covent Garden the other day
I went in there with Georgia and she
said that I had to try this so I picked
this up apparently this formula the
serum foundation is quite similar to
NARS sheer glow which was always a
favorite of mine I picked up the shade
2.0 PE light/medium it says SPF 15 as
well and this one has pink undertones so
I think I'll apply this with my it
cosmetics brush I'm gonna pop some on
the back of my hand I can tell this is a
kind of bottle that's gonna get really
really grubby it's got that like
textured black lid let's give it a go it
feels quite watery but then serum
foundations usually do I don't want
anything too high coverage that have got
a bit of a natural tan I say natural tan
it's completely fake let me show you
what I used actually this morning I
sprayed this on my face this is a real
product catch it for you guys this is a
new I think it's a gradual tan it's as
adaptive tanning mist from Oscars this
is I believe a hundred percent natural
yeah tri-phase 100% natural self-tanning
mist so I love to use I'm a big fan of
Vita Liberata and I use the phenomenal
tan in the darkest one so it's a two to
three week tan and that is why my body
is brown and then I like to use a spray
on my face because I find that it's just
really really quick to do and I don't
like putting the mitt on my face so much
like I always use a spray on my face
that lives in this room here with my
makeup because then before I do my
makeup in the mornings if I have quite a
long time to get ready so enough time
for like a fake tan to settle in before
I apply my moisturizer then I just give
my face a quick spritz I have to say
this foundation so far feels really
comfortable it looks like it's blending
in with my skin really really nicely
this is a really really lovely
consistency I would say it's um if you
are a fan of NARS sheer glow I would say
it's actually a little bit more sheer a
little bit lighter which for this time
of year is
really nice it's given me a good bit of
coverage but still looks really really
skin-like and the best thing is it was
five pound fifty honestly so affordable
there must be a downside somewhere
either it's totally full of chemicals or
it's gonna slide off throughout the day
who knows but I'll keep you updated as
to how it lasts throughout the day as I
said after I've done this makeup I'm
gonna try not to drag it out too much
I'm going to show you some new bits that
I have in my wardrobe I made a little
order from net-a-porter and I also have
some new things from Rhys using new
things from French Connection as well so
I'll show you those in a sec okay super
please do that foundation that is
officially going in my everyday draw I
hate having foundation lip so I'm just
gonna pop on some by Terry Baume De Rose
which is now stocked in Selfridges
I always put lip balm on after my
foundations and my lips are usually
nicely nourished already for lipstick
later on and I'm so excited for the
lipstick I'm gonna use I'm gonna try out
the Galan Rouge G double mirror cap
lipsticks so these are the most
beautiful lipsticks I have ever seen and
surprisingly affordable the actual case
is $14.99 in the lipsticks I believe a
23 pounds so not that expensive for
something that it's going to last you a
really long time talk about that a
little bit more when I apply my lipstick
so I'm going to powder my base I'm going
to use my wire cell souffle let oh
actually no sorry why is that I'm going
to use my because this is a fairly new
launch it comes in this amazing
packaging it's their translucent setting
powder veil and I love the packaging it
has quite a lot of overspill up my wings
it's been in my suitcases but if I swirl
the brush around here it's just a really
lovely powder that doesn't get rid of
the glow which is amazing I'm just doing
quite a natural makeup look today
because I'm just gonna be at home
although I am filming hopefully if I get
time a fashion video later on
okay so I've done my usual eyebrows
they're a little bit darker than normal
because I have dyed them myself using
the ideal kit which I'm a big fan of
next I'm going to try this is new eyes
shadow cream from Bourjois looks like
this so nice and affordable I've heard I
think it was Alex from my coven II use
these and said they're really good dupe
for a glossier eye stick I think but
it's the satin edition 24-hour eyeshadow
this is the shade
abra cadabra in the satin finish so I'm
just going to use the dough for
applicator and pop this straight onto my
lids I feel like this could be really
nice everyday brown shade and cream
eyeshadows are so easy to apply and
great for summer great for summer
holidays this looks like a perfect kind
of mushroomy brown shade fairly natural
but it's got a little bit of shimmer but
it's definitely not sparkly I wish you
could see that a little bit more clearly
because it really is so nice okay I
don't know how much you can see of that
because it is a fairly natural color but
it looks really really beautiful and big
big fan of that and super affordable as
well I think these are definitely under
10 pounds so a really good high street I
shadow big fan of that I also have a
couple of different colors I've got odor
roses and beige seller that's these two
here both of them I think I'll probably
use when I'm doing a slightly more going
out today the pink one would be really
nice like spring everyday makeup look
and the golden probably for an evening
so they look beautiful you might have
spotted this in my hands it looks very
much like my lemare powder which is in
my trouble makeup bag but it is their
new bronzing powder and it looks
absolutely stunning so this is the
packaging of the palette and then inside
this is the bronzer you can see the
camera in the reflection mostly this
deep bronze and you've got a blush shade
running through and also some more
shimmery sections here which will
hopefully just add a nice pearlescent
glow this is my first time using this so
a real first impression oh that is
gorgeous
oh and it smells so good
that is absolutely gorgeous as I said
I'm already fairly dark so it's not made
my skin not too noticeably more Brown
but it's given just such a lovely glow I
don't if you can see they're very like
delicate highlighting my cheeks and just
a really lovely warm color all over that
is stunning
and they also have brought out these new
color sticks this one is pink sands and
it is it looks like this so this is a
cheek and lip tint I'm gonna try a
little bit on my cheek it's nice and
dewy I feel like if you're on holiday
and you having one of those days when
you just want to have a super do a
makeup look this would be absolutely
perfect so it's just a very delicate
spring pink looks really intense in the
in the packaging bad chilly on the
cheeks it's really lovely just like a
subtle pretty flush I've got two
mascaras I want to try so I'm gonna do
one on each eye this one is the new YSL
volume effect the curler mascara and as
you might be able to guess by the name
this one has a curved brush and a
pattern you don't need eyelash curlers
it's going to give you a really nice
curved lash as they've used eyelash
curlers so that looks promising and then
we also have lash topia mega volume
mineral based mascara from bare minerals
that one that looks like this and the
brush I think is just like a classic
bristle brush in my eyes bare minerals
can do no wrong so I'm very much looking
forward to trying that as well I am
gonna curl the lashes on the bare
minerals eye and see if they really do
look as good on the YSL eye so let's do
bare minerals first
okay I'm very very happy with how that
has turned out as you can see my lashes
are just like nice and fluttery all
separated there's no clumping going on
and they're really nice and intense
black as well that's just one coat of
mascara I read the press release where
it said that this has got some
ingredients in there which also really
nourishing for the lashes which is great
for my lashes at the moment time between
individual lash extensions I'm going to
get some more tomorrow so you guys can
come and have a beautiful iong day with
me tomorrow so got lots of treatments
going on but yeah this has got castor
oil in now which will help the lashes
grow help to nourish the lashes which is
always great and I think once I've let
this layer dry I might add another layer
or go for an everyday look this is a
perfect amount of mascara and then on my
left eye where I've not curled the
lashes I'm going to try this new YSL
mascara this is also going to be coming
out in brown which I will definitely be
keen to try and this is available from
Selfridges I have to say instantly it's
not giving the lashes as much length as
the bareMinerals one is and it does look
a little bit more clumpy maybe I should
have curl the lashes but let's stick
with it give it a little bit more time
I'm not sure how much detail you can see
but from my little handheld mirror the
bareMinerals eye is definitely better
this is I know I obviously use lash
colors but this mascara is much more
lifted more kind of like fluttery and
separated whereas these lashes are I'd
say actually it's like a more intense
eye but they're not as long or fluttery
looking so I am more of a fan first
impressions definitely of the
bareMinerals and it's got the mineral
ingredients in there so it's gonna be
good for lashes I am gonna do another
coat of bare minerals over the top just
add a little bit more definition I think
if you have a similar style to me where
you like your makeup to look a little
bit more natural but still kind of
enhance what you've got then at the bare
minerals one is definitely a really good
mascara it's not volumizing there I mean
my eye don't look like I've got that
many lashes but they look really like
fluttering separated whereas these are
not as long but they're more voluminous
if that makes any sense at all I have a
really glorious refreshing and setting
spray to use this is brand new I got
this in a meeting yesterday and it is
the errand and I just love that run so
much rosewater refreshing and setting
mist as you can imagine this smells
amazing it's so nice for like refreshing
your complexion during the day or
setting your makeup and the rose smell
is absolutely gorgeous and it looks
beautiful as well so that's gonna be a
major favorite for the next few weeks
let's see if it does help to set the
makeup a little bit then I'm going to go
in with my Galan Rouge G lipstick so
this is the one that I've got I have in
here shade number two which is a really
popular nude shade and then I've gone
through this beautiful pearlescent kind
of moonshine packaging so you go in you
choose your outer shell and I've got a
few beautiful ones here this is one that
I haven't even opened yet it is the
romantic Boheme and I'll leave the
correct price on the screen but I'm
pretty sure that $14.99 so they come
like this this is an empty outer casing
take off the little sticker and then
they automatically ping open and I've
got a mirror inside until you clip the
lipstick inside and here's some more
examples we've got this gorgeous very
Parisian looking polka dot style and the
lipstick inside is a beautiful intense
red shade how dreamy does that look at
see gorgeous
then a mirrored gold marble case and
inside this one I have chosen this
gorgeous balmy color so this is like a
lovely soft pink Pedley color and it is
actually a lip balm so this one is going
to go in my handbag then we have got
this almost like a rose gold leather
it's like a pebble leather and inside
this one I've got a lovely very summery
fuchsia color that is absolutely dreamy
perfect for summer parties weddings that
would be if you I think for a wedding
day if you find your perfect shade of
lipstick and
you get your case engraved with your
wedding date or your new name it's
something that you can keep forever you
can keep the case forever but just keep
topping up the lipstick as it runs out I
think that's just such a lovely thing
for a wedding day or thing to treat your
bridesmaids to that kind of thing so
here I've got an example of the box and
the lipstick so you do buy the two
separately my final box I'll show you
how I put them together this is the very
bat eek style and this one is really
unusual it's got a lips a little bit
like the mandarin oriental fan you can
see this design on the outside I've got
a gorgeous coral colored lipstick so the
lipsticks again you can get them by
themselves they look like this they look
a little bit strange when they're not in
any casing but you pull up that off and
you can see the lipstick inside and then
you just clip your lipstick into its
outer casing and that is the finished
effect as I said I'm going to try out
the one in my beautiful this is probably
my favorite packaging the pearly pink
case and it is new too number two so
when I pull it open the mirror pops up
so I can apply my lipstick on the go I'm
just quickly going to line the lips with
Charlotte Tilbury hot gossip we look so
strange before you put your lipstick on
and then I'm going to apply the lipstick
so it looks like this this is the color
it's a really beautiful brownie nude
exactly my fave so let's give this a go
oh my goodness that is absolutely dreamy
the consistency is I would just describe
it as like a typical lipstick it just
feels very comfortable it's not matte
it's not shiny it's just got a little
bit of a sheen to it which hopefully
it's gonna mean it's gonna be nice and
long-lasting very very comfortable on
the lips and this color oh my goodness
is basically my dream color so fabulous
new launch from Galan I'm now gonna do
my hair I'm gonna use my steam pod to
put some curls in and then I'm gonna
show you what I have been purchasing
lately so back in a second
so the conditioner that I used this
morning was way too thick for my hair so
it's left quite a lot of product in the
ends which is really annoying but I'm
getting my hair color tomorrow so I'm
not gonna re wash it or anything just
means I'm gonna leave it leave the curls
to really cool down and set before I
brush it otherwise I'll end up with part
straight bits of hair so I'm gonna leave
it looking like this while I show you
guys my new pieces okay we're down here
again I'm so pleased with how this
makeup looks this lipstick color is
literally gonna be my spring and
lipstick so so happy with that and the
base just looks fabulous and glowy so a
big fan of all of those pieces um okay
so I'm gonna start off by showing you
something which actually I unboxed a
couple of days ago and I did show you on
my Instagram stories and most of you
guys really liked it but I'm really keen
to hear your actual comments as opposed
to just an Instagram story poll so let
me know what you think of this down in
the comments below and I definitely have
an argument for and against keeping it
and it is this bag from cult Gaia so
this is I've never had a cult guy bag
before but you know the ones they're
like Halfmoon bags that there aren't
dupes of everywhere now that's what made
cut Gaia famous it is a designer brand
but they're not ridiculously expensive I
mean they're expensive for what they are
I think this was around a hundred and
seventy I'm not entirely sure but I'll
leave it link down below which is a lot
for a straw bag but I thought it was
just really effective really pretty very
visually appealing and I do have a few
more trips coming up that this would
look really fabulous on things like
summer garden parties I feel like I
always say that but I think this would
just really look really nice with quite
a few outfits that I've got I'm gonna
feature this in a video that I'm gonna
film this afternoon so yeah really
interested to know what you guys think
my argument so those are my arguments
for keeping it and the fact that it's
not crazy expensive considering it is a
designer bag but my argument against
keeping it is that I do have my tassel
straw bag actually I have two straw bags
that I took to the Maldives and am Alfie
my little clutch bag with the pom pom
and my top handle roughly one that I
took to the Maldives so I do have a few
summery bags already and the Tassili one
was also fairly expensive so do I need
another one who knows I've also put in a
little calico bag because as you can see
it is see-through anything that I put
inside here would fall out or get really
tangled amongst the amongst and what
would you call that
weaving straw weaving I don't know yet
but very tangled and it would look quite
messy so I've had to put a little bag
inside this too so yeah let me know what
you guys think of this I do think it's
adorable and I would definitely keep it
if it was like 40 or 50 pounds but
because it is over the hundred pound
mark it definitely requires some serious
consideration so please let me know your
thoughts so a lot of my other new pieces
these are very kindly sent to me from me
and em and then I've also got some nice
new pieces from Rhys they're all in this
pile here and I haven't actually tried
them on yet so I think what I'm going to
do this is my really casual working from
home this morning outfit by the way I've
got my little super cheap vest top this
was from a new look and then these are
like old Topshop trousers but yeah as
you saw I went to the gym this morning
came home and popped something super
comfy on so what I'm gonna do is
actually try on these pieces and then
this is mostly stuff that I think you
guys have seen before you probably will
recognize these pieces from my Zara haul
this have been wearing the loads
recently I'm gonna film with that in a
second how nice does my ring look I'm
still just so obsessed with this ring oh
my god I feel like I haven't showed you
guys a close-up in a little while but
let's just appreciate how beautiful this
is
Charlie has done very very well anyway
it's like distraction and yeah so I'm
gonna style potentially some of these
new bits and show you some of the new
bits from here as well that you may not
have seen yet so let's get trying
alright this is definitely not the best
outfit combination but what I'm showing
you is just beautiful blouse this is one
from me and am I loved glasses like this
at this time of year it's like really
perfect for spring because it's lovely
lightweight material but
it still keeps you fairly warm if it's a
little bit breezy outside perfect for
the office as well as holidays things
like that really really like this detail
that is very effective and I like the
fact that it's not really open but it's
still quite like low-cut but not
revealing in the slightest so that's the
first piece from me and M oh they're
shorts by the way are from Rhys I
haven't actually worn these out yet even
though I've had them for a couple of
weeks because I've not been too sure
what star them with although I've got
this blouse here also from Rhys which
will look amazing with them so maybe
I'll try that combo on together next
okay definitely these shorts look so
much better with this top this is a
lovely little silk cami that I got from
Rhys recently and it's been one of my
favourite pieces in my wardrobe lately
it looks really really nice with turn
lovely and loose and breezy I also wore
this yesterday with my beautiful
broderie anglaise Auris skirt this is
what I wore yesterday if I can find a
photo I'll pop it up on the screen now
but this was just such a gorgeous little
combination that's so so pretty very
perfect for spring very much my style
very elegant and ladylike in fact I
think I'm going to feature this as one
of my five outfits in the video I'm
about to film which is going to be my
five outfit ideas for sunny days or
outfit ideas for spring let me know what
you think I should call it this is my
next item from Rhys and apologies I'm
definitely not wearing it the correction
under after this I'm wearing not nude so
this is a very lovely lightweight dress
it is very long line it's got beautiful
pleat detail which you can see in the
sleeves it's things like this which I
think make risa items so so lovely this
I would probably wear with the right
under wear I would wear just by itself
with some really nice jewelry some
really nice earrings I probably like pin
my hair back I might actually wear this
next week I've got a couple of nice
events that I'm going to with my mum
yeah this underwear is really making it
not look as good as it could do but a
really pretty lovely lightweight item
for spring again could be a nice one for
wearing to the office I just can't stop
staring at sleeves they are so so
beautiful
it's got like a pleat starting from the
shoulders and then pushing its way down
so so lovely in fact
look really nice with the cult Gaia bag
what a gorgeous spring outfit love that
oh my goodness this is genuinely one of
the most beautiful and one of the most
me items of clothing I think I have ever
tried on and this is also from Reese
beautiful pleated dress and oh my
goodness it's absolutely gorgeous the
length is beautiful it finishes just
above the knees so a nice feminine and
but very elegant length and then as you
can see the bodice is just all these
gorgeous gorgeous pleats the top I could
do it all the way to the top I thought I
would leave a little bit of skin showing
this is my new necklace this one is from
Lynx it's from their splendor collection
really really beautiful and very
effective and nice against tan skin so
and look at the sleeves it's got this
beautiful fluted sleeve which I'm still
absolutely in love with this would be a
good one if you're planning on eating a
lot as well because plenty of room for
indulgence I've just popped this on with
some new Topshop shoes which I'm still a
little undecided about they're quite
heavy if you're going to pack them for a
holiday we've got a wooden heel but then
I think they're pretty pretty nice and
affordable easy to slip on so that's the
shoes I've paired it with once again
with the occult Gaia bag that could be
really really nice a very easy summer
look next outfit is another really easy
one for summer days I have just tried on
at this lovely new top again from meat
and M this brand they're always such
high-quality materials this is a super
soft cotton top and it's got this lovely
lace detail down here at the bottom you
can see it's just got this very simple
panel of lace very effective needs to be
hung up for a bit longer because it's a
little bit creased but this has got a
little loop hole pocket detail there
keyhole detail and then the trousers are
some lovely linen trousers from French
Connection I think that linen trousers
are a brilliant staple for summer
wardrobe I actually took these up a
couple of inches so they are a little
bit more cropped another jumper here
from me and M this is one of their
amazing cashmere hoodies and these are
just the most luxurious thing it to wear
as loungewear if you work from home or
if you travel a lot I spent all of my
time during our travels when I was
actually traveling in a me and
jumper because they're just such good
quality they always look good even if
you've been like sleeping on an airplane
for hours and hours it was do I have it
here now I'll show you to you in my main
wardrobe but it's the best this is
absolutely gorgeous again it just looks
really nice with a tan beautiful color
really nice chilled shape very nice
casual wear but also you can just tell
that it's a luxury piece really really
good quality a couple more new pieces
and firstly this top is new from Reese
again unsurprisingly I was attracted to
some because of the beautiful color it's
like a dusty rose blush pink but a
little bit more lilac II love how much
like skin is exposed up here very very
summery beautiful straps as well I don't
know how much you can see but they're
like a ruched material on the straps and
then of course you've got this lovely
frill across there on the back it is a
tie detail at the very top there if I
had someone helping me right now IRA do
it in a nice little bow but at the
moment I've just tied it in a knot I
have got it on with these gorgeous
trousers now these are from French
Connection I am quite shorts they're a
little bit long for me I'm trying to
stand on my tiptoes and I'm not
balancing very well but they have this
epic pleat detail down at the side here
you can see they really aren't much too
long for me so the the main fabric of
the trousers opens up and then it's like
a chiffon material in here which is just
absolutely gorgeous I think I'm
definitely gonna have to take these to
the tailors because I don't think I'm
skilled enough to take these up by
myself it should be fairly easy but then
once they're taken up that's just going
to be so so effective I love white
trousers at this time of year I find
them really good for so many different
occasions they can be very very smart
but also chilled out vibes as well oh my
goodness I'm now really in ordered
myself because I've had this top in my
wardrobe for about four or five weeks I
got it before all of our holidays or
white robes they definitely were work
ships and not holidays but I didn't try
it on because I didn't think I would
like it now that I've tried it on I
think this is probably one of my
favourite things in my wardrobe it is
absolutely beautiful
especially when worn with high-waisted
trousers like these this I think is just
from Topshop so really affordable but it
looks so much like as
or like a much more expensive designer
it just fits so so nicely it's got a
crossover detail in the front beautiful
floral pattern and then it's got this
band around the waist which I think or
not maybe waist it's a little bit above
the waist around the chest which I just
think is so super super flattering just
popped my hair up so it's getting a
little bit warm back to this amazing top
which I just researched and it's only 22
pounds they've sold out size 4 but every
other size is available this is a size 6
and it fits perfectly you could probably
make it fit you perfectly anyway is a
tie at the back then you've got this
little tie detail there perfect for
summer holidays but also spring days
here in the UK I think I'm gonna wear
this to the Chelsea Flower Show next
week I just oh my gosh absolutely love
it I have paired it this is a head to
toe actually not shoes this and this are
both super affordable High Street pieces
these are from River Island they are
some lovely white not really culottes
wide leg trousers with some stunning
lace detail down at the bottom I
absolutely love these this whole outfit
I am really really happy with I hadn't
tried on either these pieces before and
now I feel like this could potentially
be a favorite outfit you'll be seeing me
wearing on repeat these shoes I'm sorry
I never filmed a what I bought in
America video I just did not have time
but these are what I bought from Tory
Burch in Dallas and they are just so
stunning I'm going to take one off to
show you properly so you've got this
gorgeous material down at the sole on
the heel really a little low heel and
then this beautiful pearl detail on the
toe they're just absolutely stunning not
the most comfortable shoes in the world
and much better for posing and if you're
not going to be doing too much walking
like I wouldn't go shopping in them once
again maybe this bag is a keeper because
it seems to go with so many outfits but
how nice is that
also this top and trouser combination
only shows it's a little bit of tummy
and I feel like this is always the most
toned bit because if you do any kind of
exercises in the gym that focus on your
tummy this bit get stoned the first and
this bit is where your food sits so I
feel like if you want your tummy to look
nice and
this is a really good outfit to do so so
I'm very very happy with this little
combination by the way everything that I
have mentioned in this video will all be
linked down below so if you want to
recreate this outfit which I would
highly recommend and they'll be linked
in the description box so check that out
for the direct links this to me is a
summer holiday piece there is actually
quite a lot of fabric here but the end
result is just absolutely stunning it is
a beach I would say this is like a
summer day dress if you are going
anywhere we need to dress a little bit
more conservatively beautiful
lightweight cotton material it's got
this lovely lace detail going down the
sleeves some really beautiful pleating
around the waist and then it is full
length down at the bottom as well and
then you can just kind of undo the
buttons and reveal as much side leg as
you want to once again I've had it with
the Topshop shoes and once again I feel
like it would be absolutely perfect with
the copper hair bag I think I'm slowly
but surely persuading myself that this
bag needs to stay part of my collection
what do you think has your opinion
changed do you think I should keep it
now because it really does look so good
with everything but yeah this dress has
a really really beautiful shape to it
very elegance this would be yeah
definitely coming with me on upcoming
summer holidays I have got Sufis Hindu
to look forward to and I feel like this
would be the perfect one although maybe
it's a bit Bridal to wear on someone
else's Hendo hmm let me know what you
think getting to the last few pieces now
and this is a beautiful new lace dress
also from a French Connection just the
most beautiful quality lace it's got
this gorgeous sky out effect going in
like tears tears yeah let's tear down to
the gist about the new level beautiful
same effect on the sleeves which is very
very tan enhancing and then it's also
got that scallops almost like a pompom
effect on it over their flat on at the
neckline cross over a neckline and then
it's got a zip closure just a really
lovely dress if you've got christenings
engagement parties summer parties you
could wear this to things like the races
or I don't know if you're going to
Wimbledon it would be really nice for
that gosh that's going to come up very
soon and yeah
any slightly similar to summer occasions
it's really nice to have something like
this in your wardrobe so this is another
beautiful one at French Connection have
so many gorgeous pieces at the moment
this one I am a big fan of so I'm not
sure if I would wear this combination
together because it is quite in your
face but I think the trousers are really
really cute the top I think I think I am
a little bit too old if I'm totally
honest but the trousers are really
really good fun and these are really
affordable they are from Miss Selfridge
a really really nice summer holiday
outfit I think if you're going to I
don't know like Majorca or Spain with
your friends and you just want to look
super chic but also very Instagram well
should the opportunity arise to get a
good snap then this is a really gorgeous
outfit you're not going to get too hot
in this you're showing off any toned
tummy areas and any areas of nice turn
or nice highlighting if you've done all
of that if you've got really good boobs
as well this would be amazing I don't
have any but if you've got good boobs
and this would be fabulous
and yeah really nice really nice light
weight trousers to wear over the top of
a bikini you're not going to get too hot
in this so I thought I would show you
this I was going to show you this top
with a pair of denim shorts but I think
mine in the wash however I've tried it
on with these light colored jeans from
coasts and I absolutely love how they
look also with these shoes I think it's
very flattering and also if you're not
quite ready to get your legs out yet
then pastel colored jeans are absolutely
amazing the top is from River Island
nice and affordable and I think it looks
absolutely gorgeous you've got these
like thick fabric straps that go over
the shoulder I think it looks like a
designer top it really does I mean it's
only when you get up close that you can
tell not that the material is cheap but
it is not like you know perfectly
finished like a design on top would be
but does have a very very high-end look
about it it's got almost like a
crossover detail here a little bit of
pleating on the boob area and I just
think it's such a beautiful fit it looks
really nice at the back as well yeah
really like how it looks with the
trousers this once again could be a nice
look for the office if you can get away
with something a little bit more
feminine like this so yes another item
that I've had for a little while haven't
tried it on there now that I
I'm absolutely well I've got these
trousers on I thought I would quickly
show you this top as well this is
another beautiful one from French
Connection really beautiful fabric you
can see it's got it looks almost like a
like a thick linen material but it's a
lot more comfortable than linen really
nice for framing a pretty necklace very
tan enhancing next to the bright white
color very comfortable it's almost like
smoking but it's not one-shoulder which
is great very kind of flamenco style and
then yeah once again with the jeans not
sure if I mentioned but these are from
coast I always find Coast denim to be
super comfortable very very flattering
and a really nice elastic content and
very good quality yeah there's not one
that you think of for denim coast but
they have really really nice denim so
check that out I've also decided that
I'm actually not gonna do that video the
five sunny day outfits because I'm not
gonna have time because it's now like 4
o'clock I've been filming this section
for about two hours everything takes so
much longer than you think it will and I
have quite a lot of stuff left on my
to-do list so what I'm gonna do is after
showing you a couple more outfits I'm
gonna actually finish this video because
I think it'll be very long so this will
be a new makeup and what's new in my
wardrobe and then tomorrow I'm gonna
film my beauty day so I've got a lot of
beauty treatments tomorrow and then
Saturday going to the Royal Wedding I
say going I'm not actually going but
going into Windsor with Sophie to see it
all unfold Ang's you're gonna get two
vlogs and so I hope that's okay let me
know if you much prefer the ones where I
put the camera on the tripod and it's
like this maybe I will I'll see how I
get a long time wise but as it stands
you're gonna get this video and another
vlog on Mondays I hope that's okay
also wear the same pair of trousers I've
popped on this lovely pink blouse this
is also from coast really beautiful
lightweight material again I'm really
liking this little bow blouse on
at the neckline and then it's got as you
can see open sleeves are just a little
seam caught in the middle there to keep
them together
Leah lovely and loose and floaty of
spring and the I've got the bow here and
then as you can see on at the cuffs it
has got this like sequin detail
which first I wasn't sure if I like Sean
knots I thought it made it a little bit
too jazzy but then actually it's not
that obvious it's quite subtle because
it's a bit of a matte sequin and it just
gives the top a little extra detail if
you wanted to wear it in the evenings
this could definitely work for like a
dinner party or if you're going for date
night or something so yeah really lovely
color as well very beautiful fabric from
coast
I keep thinking we're nearly at the end
right there is actually a lot of stuff
on this rail I have maybe like three
more outfits to show you this is another
really beautiful dress from French
Connection it's got the gorgeous
gorgeous detail down at the bottom where
you can always see where it's it's
actually I think this is lace yeah lace
down in the bottom I was trying to see
if it was the same material in which
case it would be laser-cut but nope
definitely lace there are pockets which
is a wonderful I know we are all
obsessed with pockets where did that
obsession come from I guess it's so that
you can like stand in a really like
nonchalant way but I do like it
the top is a really elastic e material
which makes it so comfortable super
flattering it's almost like a little
ballerina top like a little tutu not too
too Liat hard to tease the bottom in and
I believe yes it has adjustable a girl
the mess on the poofy seat behind me you
that's what I have to clear up for after
these videos yeah once again great for
showing off the turn that Charlie's in
them actually houses dress and it looks
amazing on her she has a really great
style I think I will probably dress the
same when I am her age she's not that
old but yeah we've got the same style
anyway I digress
gorgeous dress from French Connection I
think that's the last of the dresses um
yeah I think I've shown you most of this
stuff I don't I'm done I love how
everything is literally the same color
palette but you know what that's what I
love I've got something a little bit
deeper and different from Zara you
probably saw all this in my Xaro haul
this I think you've seen a few times on
the Instagram it is from it's got a
little ribbon hanging from it it is from
Elle cabinets I love their straw bags at
the moment and this is a really nice big
spacious one fits
stuffin their shorts are a trend that
we've seen really emerging as we creep
into summer which you won't be surprised
about if you watched my video oh my god
it was a couple of months ago where I'd
said about these spring summer trends I
did say that smart shorts would be one
of the trends of you seeing and here
they are these are probably the favorite
ones that I have found anywhere these
are River Island beautiful material they
like it kind of textured almost like a
jacquard material really really nice and
then they've got these three gold
buttons going up to being quite a high
waisted style I've got the Tory Burch
shoes on again they don't have pockets I
keep like moving my hand around here
trying to find them but they're not
there and then I have matched the
smartness of the shorts with a lovely
blouse this one is from Rhys a beautiful
little investment piece if you look
closely it has got like shimmering bits
of fabric so it's almost like kind of
like a leopard or a giraffe I don't know
need to I need for our instead of a
white one or you could wear if you saw
my Zara haul you'll see that I got some
little tops that go really nicely one is
actually like a leotard underneath
things like this great for anything to
share but a nude bra is what I have one
with this blouse in the past beautiful
lightweight material and a really
gorgeous color that works as so many
things so I thought this is a really
cute little combination and this is the
last outfit that I'm going to show you
because I have got a lot of emails that
need answering since I started filming
this and it is such a beautiful one to
finish on this is from Coast and oh my
gosh it's just the most beautiful
material I love the materials at this
time of year I love as you know light
and floaty things and this is both of
those beautiful quality material it's
very very light it would be great for a
really warm day I've not done it up
properly if you're going against like
Wimbledon I might wear this to the royal
wedding I might wear this on Saturday to
go to Windsor I'm not attending the
wedding as I said so it doesn't matter
if I wear a little bit of white but it's
got this beautiful it looks like a
dip-dye floral pattern in the skirt it
feels like a beautiful very lightweight
cotton has a gorgeous flow to the
material it looks beautiful with these
little Tory Burch sandals
once again and I swear these sandals are
getting more and more comfortable so
maybe I need to give them another go
because I did say they weren't very
comfy earlier but they're getting better
on I am rumbling and my batteries about
to go so I think I'm gonna finish this
video here so it's been yeah turned into
a what's new in my wardrobe I feel like
my vlogs always turn into things they
start as a vlog and then I get so
carried away that they become something
else so I hope you don't mind stay tuned
