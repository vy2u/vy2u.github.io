me for today's video which is going to
be what's new my wardrobe so I've
decided that I'm going to do these
videos on the first Wednesday of every
month just to keep it a little bit more
consistent that way you guys know when
you're going to see them and also I
wanted to make them more of a regular
feature because I am aware that I do a
lot of holes on my channel and you guys
see so many clothes coming in and out
and obviously I don't keep everything
because that would be bonkers so I
thought that these videos are a really
nice way of editing down showing you the
pieces that I'm keeping the pieces that
I have been wearing a lot throughout the
past month and just to introduce those
new pieces to you so that if you want to
shop them whether you see them on my
Instagram or in other videos then you
will already have seen them in these
videos so pencil in the first Wednesday
of every month into your diaries because
that will be what's new my wardrobe
Wednesday's if you've been keeping up
with my channel lately then you'll
probably have seen a lot of these pieces
sneaking into videos already I have
already got a lot of use out of these
pieces but also some are things that you
may not have seen or things that are
actually pretty new but I'm definitely
going to be wearing a lot in the coming
weeks and months but also because I did
a vlog a couple of weeks ago that turned
into a what's new in my wardrobe there's
not a mad amount so this is gonna be
quite a short and sweet one with just a
few key pieces to share with you the
first I'm gonna get started on is
actually this top that I'm wearing now I
went in to Club Monaco during the
Chelsea Flower Show and they were doing
a pre summer sale and it was 25% off
everything in this store so I bought a
few pieces from there including this top
if you guys have been around on my
channel for a long time you might
remember that I have something quite
similar to this but in long sleeve also
from Club Monaco that was always my
favorite jumper and I really wanted a
few similar things to that in my
wardrobe and this is just absolutely
perfect it's great for summer cuz
obviously it's short sleeved and I just
think it's so beautiful and very very me
so I definitely beeline towards this and
instantly fell in love in Club Monaco
during the same shopping trip I also
fell in love with this beautiful little
cord so we had this gorgeous top it is a
linen material with this textured
embroidery detail and the flow
the dark blue flowers are actually straw
I don't if you can see that there they
are like a woven straw material and this
beautiful embroidery detail on the crop
top and then also on the skirt the skirt
as you can see here has a dipped hem
really beautiful it just hangs in the
most gorgeous way it's almost kind of
flamenco style very comfortable because
it is elasticated great for those
barbecues when you want to indulge and
together they just look so so cute
I haven't actually worn either of them
separately but I most certainly will do
and I think this is definitely gonna be
an outfit that I'm going to take to
Valencia to wear on Sophie's hen dukes I
definitely get some serious Spanish
vibes from this from the premium high
street to the more affordable high
street this next top that I have is from
ASOS now this I haven't actually worn it
out the house yet so I just inserts clip
of me trying it on here but I think it
is the most beautiful little top and I
love the design details on here so many
ruffles I really like this kind of
netted almost effect here got really
beautiful ruffles going all the way
around and then this beautiful fluted
sleeve I think it's just so flirty and
feminine and it looks really nice over
it's actually not sheer as it looks I
was wearing this lace bra underneath
this earlier to film another video which
you guys will see on Sunday and you
can't see the bra through it at all so
that's great and kind of surprising but
this just super affordable
I get really Cloe vibes from it and I
think it's so so pretty and feminine in
it so this is a lovely new favorite if
you guys didn't see the last what's new
in my wardrobe which as I mentioned came
as part of a vlog then I would
definitely recommend it because it was
quite a big one and there were loads of
pieces from recent there which I have
just loved wearing so so so much a feel
from it in the wash or a few of them are
packed for an overnight stay I'm doing
tonight and but in case you didn't see
it I'll tell you which pieces I've been
wearing so much one I do actually have
here and it is this beautiful little
camisole top now this is actually
polyester at the price and the
appearance would make you think it is
silk but because it's polyester it's a
lot more easy to care for it's so
beautiful the cut the shape quality of
the material is so gorgeous and I've
been wearing this a lot it does also
have adjustable straps and then just
yeah absolutely love this you guys will
have seen this in
some videos over the past couple of
weeks there's also my puted dress from
Rhys I'll insert a video clip of it here
that is fairly new to my wardrobe as
well but oh my gosh this is probably the
favorite thing in my wardrobe at the
moment it is so me I've worn it so much
it's perfect length I just adore how it
fits
I love the fluted sleeves I love the
pleated details I've been getting loads
of use out of that and then a favorite
outfit from another couple of pieces
from Rhys has been the longline silk
shirt dress and then also the little
silk shorts when I showed you these two
pieces in the last video I wasn't sure
exactly how to wear them but I think
together they look absolutely amazing
and I've been loving and pairing them
with my mulberry Seton handbag so that's
been another favorite outfit from some
new pieces Rhys outerwear is also just
incredible so this is something new from
them as you can see I've not worn it yet
but this is a spring/summer update on a
trench coat so you may think Josie why
buying trench coats in the spring and
summer but it's because actually here in
the UK it can get quite chilly in the
evenings the weather is still very
unpredictable I actually would have
loved to have had this in my wardrobe a
few weeks ago and went to ask Cox it was
quite a chilly day but something like
this is still really smart so great for
wearing over a dress if you've got any
weddings and you don't know if it's
going to be maybe a little bit chilly in
the afternoon or evening then a smart
coat like this it's just such a lovely
thing to have in your wardrobe and
obviously will help you to transition
your wardrobe into autumn as well
speaking of trench coats and this is
definitely a love it or hate it
item but I absolutely adore it it is my
Topshop trench coat in this clear vinyl
material I have apps in love drying this
it's super affordable but also a great
deal of the designer versions which I
would never spend over a thousand pounds
on a raincoat it's totally bonkers but
this has come in surprisingly useful on
those really drizzly days you can still
obviously see your outfit underneath
it's totally clear and it's just a
really really fun piece to wear if you
live in England or Wales or anywhere
else where it's really rainy then this
is just a really fabulous thing to have
in your wardrobe and it's one of the
best forty or forty nine pounds I've
spent in quite a long time so this is a
bit of a random one and not something
that I normally talk about or including
my videos but I just really wanted to
include this little
Brasi a and i also have the matching
brazilian knickers to wear with it
because it's just so adorable this is
from intimacy me they actually very
kindly sent it to me so I'm very
grateful of them for introducing me to
this style I actually love the style of
this and the fit so much that I went
into the store and I bought this one
which is the pale blue version but this
is actually a crop top so it comes down
a little bit lower which I think is a
really beautiful style so comfortable so
flattering if you are quite small in the
chest area like me I think these are
just really really pretty it's Italian
lace really good quality fits the body
really perfectly as well as see if
you're wearing anything with a really
light fabric over the top it's not going
to leave any lines or bumps and it has
been my favourite undergarment over the
past few weeks so I thought why not
throw that in there we're all grown-ups
here we can talk about underwear one
more coat and this one again is from
Topshop you may have seen this in my
spring lookbook thank you for all of
your lovely comments on that by the way
look books my favorite videos to film
and produce so I'm so glad that you guys
enjoyed it if you haven't seen it yet it
is beautiful go and check it out I wore
this in that as well as in my spring
everyday outfits video and I just
absolutely adore it
it is a white faux leather surprisingly
affordable considering how expensive it
looks and it's been my go-to coat for
those slightly chillier spring summer
mornings so this is probably my favorite
piece to show you in today's video if
you follow me on instagram you will not
be surprised to see this it is my
beautiful Kate Spade dress I had the
pleasure of working with Kate Spade a
couple of weeks ago and I was gifted
this dress as a result I know pinch me
and I love it so much it is so beautiful
the colors are not something that I'd
usually go for but the floral floaty
design of it means that it's just so
feminine so fun so romantic I love how
it fits it's so statement and someone
actually wore this to the Royal Wedding
apparently I didn't see it myself but on
Instagram a few of you commented saying
that you've seen it at the Royal Wedding
I think again this will be great for
summer weddings and garden parties
barbecues Hindus and things like that so
sorry if you're bored a bit already but
I'm going to be wearing this a whole
as part of the same job with Kate Spade
I was also given these shoes and these
to me are the perfect summer sandals
they are pink
so almost skin color they go with
practically everything they're very leg
length something chunky heel makes them
very very comfortable easy to walk in
and then the ankle strap means that
they're not moving around so basically
my perfect shoe I've been wearing these
again a lot and they give me the perfect
height boost for summer but without
being totally uncomfortable so a huge
fan of these if I show you them a little
more closely you can also see this
beautiful ruffle detail which is so so
pretty and then the last thing to
complete that look was this adorable
little bucket bag again from Kate Spade
I think this is called the hey Street
bucket bag bucket bags are gonna be a
huge trend this summer you're already
seeing lots of them on the high street
and then the more premium designer
stores and for good reason they actually
fit so much in but still being able to
maintain that really cute little
handheld bag vibe as well as wearing it
just like this I've also been wearing it
over the shoulder on slightly more
casual occasions but personally I love
to wear it just with a little hand strap
I usually unclip the shoulder straps and
just pop that inside so yeah really cute
tiny little bag but it definitely fits
my camera my phone my lipstick my purse
I'm a phone charger so a very
surprisingly roomy bag these are also
Kate Spade but actually separate to the
collaboration that I did with the Kate
Spade Regent Street store again you
might have seen these in recent vlogs
and outfit videos they are my new
sunglasses with these adorable floral
details around the edges just a bit of
fun I think it's a really nice way of
brightening up what is otherwise a very
classic pair of black Sunny's so I'll be
wearing these a lot more on upcoming
trips and lovely sunny days and then I
have a fabulous new bag from Aspinall
and this has been on my wish list ever
since their press day which was about
six months ago it is this beautiful lion
trunk bag Aspinall trunk bags are
something that I now am proud to own
three of I absolutely love them I think
they make a great statement on your
outfits and this is probably my favorite
design so far it's in the ivory camel
and Redwood color as you can see it's
got this lion knocker on the front
beautiful gold details and
top open it up and you can see how roomy
it is inside surprisingly big enough my
phone again my vlogging camera at my
person a few other essentials but
because it is stiff obviously it's not
too roomy in the newly refurbished store
in Westfield White City they also offer
free personalization as they do in their
Regent Street store so I actually got
the strap as you can see here engraved
with my name they couldn't also have
done the front of the bag but I thought
it was just a nice subtle detail to do
it on the strap so again prefer to see
me wearing this a lot because I
absolutely adore it this is from a brand
called it lovers some friends which is
probably my favorite of the revolve own
brand labels I absolutely adore this
pink floral lacy fabric I love all the
frills going on I love that it's one
shoulder with this little drop shoulder
just a really really beautiful flirty
feminine design it is a little bit
shorter than a lot of dresses in my
wardrobe but I don't mind getting my
legs out at this time of year and I wore
this to the revolve lunch at Clifton and
I absolutely loved it and insert a
couple of photos of me wearing it there
here so this has probably been my
favorite piece from the revolve Hall but
as I said check out the hall for
everything else as well you may also be
able to spot a few new Topshop and
Azores pieces on the rail behind me but
I'm going to be doing a high street haul
very very soon a lot of these I've not
even tried on yet so I'm not going to
include them in this video because as I
said I want this to be more of a refined
edit so stay tuned to see these pieces
