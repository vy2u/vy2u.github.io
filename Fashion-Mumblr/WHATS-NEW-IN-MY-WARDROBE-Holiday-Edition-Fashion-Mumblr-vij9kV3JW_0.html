joining me for today's video it's going
to be a what's new in my wardrobe
holiday edition so at the moment I am
abroad a mixture of work trip / pleasure
and I thought I would show you all of
the things which are new in my wardrobe
which I'll be taking with me on the
trips so I have four trips pretty much
back-to-back and I'm not really gonna
have time to film too much in between
them so I thought what I would do is pre
film this and then I can add overlays of
me wearing them in the various locations
so I'm going to run through all the
items quite quickly but hopefully this
will mean that you know where everything
is from so when you see it in my vlogs
and my Instagram photos etc you know
where I pick them up from so without
further ado let's get started with what
I'm wearing so I'm wearing a jumper
dress from the new Ted says relaxed
collection which I'm a huge fan of and
it's perfectly timed they have had this
collection for just over a year now I
think but they've just launched their
new products from the collection it's
really good if you work from home and
you want to be a little bit more smart
in your comfy clothing and also for
traveling so this is actually a jumper
dress I have got a photo where you can
see it full length I'll insert that here
but I absolutely love it super comfy
also in the collection are lots of other
beautiful smart but also relaxed pieces
I particularly love this white top it's
got a pie crust kind of ruffle detail at
the top there around the neckline and
then you've got that beautiful fluted
sleeve effect as it's Ted Baker as you
can imagine the quality is beautiful
fabric itself is gorgeous so if you want
to look really smart when you're working
from home relaxing or on the go then
this collection is so beautiful I also
have their wake me for champagne t-shirt
which I posted on my Instagram last week
and I absolutely love this very very
true and especially once again on
airplanes they're bringing around glass
of champagne you definitely don't want
to sleep through that that's a really
fun one and then these are the matching
trousers to the top that I showed you a
second ago the whole collection I just
absolutely adore as part of that I also
have a new pair of trainers and these
are very cool for me I don't usually
wear like fashion trainers I found them
very hard to pull off previously but
because these are so beautifully
feminine
you can see that ruffle detail that we
saw in the clothing is repeated around
the heel area of the trainers and then
they've got the rose gold little Ted
Baker bow and the eyelet so it really do
match with the collection really
beautifully I think because they are so
feminine I found them very easy to wear
with a lot of my with a lot of my
outfits and including this dress so this
is potentially what I'm going to be
wearing on our next long-haul flight I
just think it's a very relaxed but still
in outfits there's very true to my
personal style so huge fan of the new
Ted says relaxed collection I'm going to
continue talking about things that I'm
wearing because otherwise I will forget
I have a few new jewelry pieces from
Astrid and Moo they are a brand that you
guys know that I absolutely love I find
them the perfect balance between amazing
quality and fairly affordable especially
I have to give a shout out to their
earrings these are coming a bit closer
some fairly plain gold hoops and I'm
typically not a hoops person but I
absolutely love these and once again the
quality is amazing I love mixing and
matching my earrings but I find that
brands even like Kate Spade I can only
wear them for a day and then they
actually start to hurt my ears whereas
astrodome you they are made from higher
quality metal I think this is rose gold
plated and not a hundred essential
they'll leave the links to them down
below and my ears never react to these
it's a huge fan of them that reason I
also have some new rings from them and
I've been trying to find some rings that
work nicely with my engagement ring
because I don't want anything to Oh TT
they'll all detract from my beautiful
ring but I also still want to be
accessorizing so this one which is show
your close up there just a couple of
very fine bands and then attached in the
middle there you can see you can kind of
squeeze it to be any size I feel as the
perfect very delicate but still really
feminine way to accessorize that hand
also from them I have this triple ring
so this is very similar to the one that
I'm wearing on my left hand this is the
ring here the top one that you're
looking at but it has three layers again
with the diamante detail in at the
middle there and then this final ring
which you can see is also adjustable you
can just kind of open it and close it
this one again is really really delicate
and very simple but works really well if
you like to stack and
layer your jewelry like I do I find it
perfect the stacking mixing and matching
and beautiful quality I'll leave the
jewelry links down below in the order
that I've mentioned it so it's really
clear which ring is which and last but
not least I have this necklace which is
a hexagon with this dangling chain which
again I think looks really beautiful
especially if your outfit is quite
simple like this dress I wanted to
accessorize but with nothing too chunky
it's very delicate and just the perfect
accessory for something like this so as
you can see just a really simple style
you have the diamond encrusted hexagon
with this hanging chain which makes it
so so lovely with more simple items of
clothing and then these were a little
bit of a wild card I picked these up
from ASOS they look like little metal
faces but I thought with a very bohemian
Mexico style outfit I thought these
could look really really cool and just
very different from me so because
they're a little bit more out there I
did go to an affordable retailer and
these were I think like 14 pounds or
something so yeah I'm excited to style
these up okay so now I'm going to go
through the rail behind me which is
looking very full and this isn't even
everything I also have a pile of coats
on the floor and to the right of me but
anyway so let's start off with a couple
of pieces from French Connection this is
a lacy style top it has got adjustable
straps I thought this would be a
fabulous layering piece and because I
fear the places I'm going to are very
warm it's gonna be nice to wear
something strappy and then I also have a
dress of a very very similar style this
is more sheer going down it's a bit of a
strange combination of material actually
cuz it's kind of knitted from there and
then lace and spaghetti style straps at
the top but I feel particularly for our
final trip which is Italy which I don't
think I will have gone on by the time
you guys watch this but I thought both
of these would be really really perfect
for that trip in particular I also have
a couple of new ish pieces from Club
Monaco which for some reason I didn't
show you in the premium high street haul
as part of the spring edit so I thought
I would show you now firstly this top
which I'm very much looking forward to
wearing on our next couple of trips it's
got a simple strap on one shoulder and
then this beautiful over shoulder
hanging bow on the other
the material is absolutely gorgeous it's
quite a thick material very textured as
you can see there and this is just gonna
look so fabulous with white jeans or
denim shorts all with a lovely
high-waisted skirt so fabulous worn from
Club Monaco and then this shirt dress
pardon it being undone I have worn a
little bit on my Instagram recently in
London so it's been working really well
as we move into spring here but also
will be coming with me on my trips again
at Club Monaco beautiful blush colored
material it's got a Cape style back so
it's quite like open up the back great
for keeping you cool and a really lovely
length as well it comes to just above
the knees so a very elegant length very
practical if you wanted to wear it for
work and also social occasions as well
next are a few very cozy pieces from a
brand called me and M firstly this
jumper just a beautiful very good
quality plain white jumper gorgeous knit
it's just very simple it's got a bit of
a detail going on with the way that the
stitches are positioned here this is
just so soft so comfortable and is going
to be my travel jumper along with some
of the tedsters relaxed leggings so a
very stylish very comfortable outfit for
wearing on the plane and also from me
and M they very kindly actually sent me
a couple of t-shirts these I have not
worn yet as you can see from the tags
inside this one I know I will get so
much use out of because it is a silk
t-shirt and I always say investing in
good quality staples like this is such a
good thing to do because they are such
classics that you wear them over and
over again this is a size 6 it's got a
raw hem so it's really really beautiful
detail there again I'll show you a
close-up so you can see the hem has been
cuts and left raw and then it is quite
oversized so it should look really
really beautiful at paired with jeans or
again with skirts high-waisted skirts so
many different outfit combinations this
next one also has a silky feel but it's
more the top layer whereas the layer
which is actually on the body is a more
knitted soft cotton material it's called
the double layer long swing top and
again I have a size 6 it is quite long
it's got the silky layer which overhangs
so it should be very flattering in that
it covers the bomb and maybe a little
bit of the thighs as well and you can
see the double layer the silk
on the sleeves especially I have got
quite a few new things from Rhys but I'm
just going to show you the items as I
pick them up so no particular order
firstly from Rhys is this beautiful pair
of shorts oh now I had a tailored pair
of shorts from Rhys that I got this time
last year and I still absolutely love
them I'm also bringing them to Mexico
with me so I know that resorts are a
great investment piece these are more of
a silky material in almost a champagne
color and they almost have a kind of
soot stripe to them not sure if you can
see very clearly there but they are a
little bit striped beautifully tailored
they have got pockets in the side a zip
closure and then also little clasps at
the top and then you've got these kind
of faux pocket detail at the back so
they very much look like a pair of
cropped suit style trousers these paired
with one of the me and M
silk t-shirts is just such an easy
classic beautiful look for spring and
will definitely be one of my go-to
outfits in the upcoming weeks and months
I also have loads of new pieces from
River Island one of which is this lovely
top I think this is great for upcoming
European holidays in particular lovely
almost shirt style Peter Pan color
beautiful stripe material love the tour
toys style buttons as well and then it
does vary slightly peplum out at the
bottom so it should be very very
flattering for a lovely feminine
silhouettes I think the colors are
gorgeous as well very much like a candy
stripe style looks a bit like a one of
those candy paper bags the first
swimsuit of the haul this one is from
Ted Baker I personally feel more
comfortable in swimsuits and I do it in
bikinis it's just how I first look on
the beach and this one is a beautiful
white swimsuit with a school just detail
in the middle so it is it kind of cutout
embroidered detail this makes it a
little bit more unusual than a plain
white costume really lovely load if at
the back and I know when you want to
have your back tanned or just back
exposed to the Sun it's lovely when the
costumes have a really low back
price-wise this was 95 pounds so it is a
premium swing costume but I think when
you are on the beach on beach holidays
like up Maldives you are in your
swimming costume all day every day so
it's definitely worth investing a little
bit more and this one I also think is
really nicely cut on the legs so nice
and high which again I find very
flattering and leg
actioning so looking forward to packing
this one away for our Maldivian trip
another serene cozy more affordable this
one is from Topshop I just thought this
pattern was really good fun it's kind of
like a zebra again it's cuts really high
so you should get a very tanned booty
you're very flattering on the bum nice
and flattering on the legs as well very
lengthening with the high cut once again
really thin straps it's got a little bit
more coverage on the back but very open
on the top area so great for getting a
good tan and then I also think that this
more square cut detail across the bust
area across the chest is very much on
trend at the moment so a great one at
from at Topshop a few more beachy pieces
this is the first Beach cover-up this is
from Melissa Oda bash now this is great
if you want to have something that's
really good for wearing on the beach but
also for smarter things like going to
lunch or nipping into town or something
because the material is slightly thicker
it's got a beautiful elasticated section
at the top which means you can wear it
really loosely or you can even pull it
to be more Bardot style the color is
absolutely gorgeous and then it has
almost like a dressing gown style tie in
at the waist and I probably will wear
this first thing in the morning when you
just want to put your swimming costume
on put your Sun cream on and then mooch
around on the pillar for a bit are
pretty wear it during those kind of
occasions something else has been in my
wardrobe for quite a while is this dress
from Marcia Elle but I haven't worn it
yet I haven't been on any holidays it's
been appropriate for but I think I'll be
getting a lot of use out of it on our
upcoming ones similar to the Reese
trials is almost got a very fine stripe
to the material which i think is really
beautiful lovely feminine ruffle detail
on the sleeves and then it's very open
so it's gonna feel really light and
fresh hopefully going to be really
flattering as well with this waistband
which you can pull in and create a very
feminine silhouette it's very light open
and breezy and then at the bottom you
also have this frill detail down there
too so super girly I think will be very
very flattering and really nice when you
are a little bit more tanned weather
spoke town or real tan with a beautiful
delicate gold necklace this will look
absolutely dreamy I am sure so the
measure L dress and also this one from
privacy please are both actually from
revolve and this one again has a similar
style
tie waist detail so should be also very
in love the color of this and I was
really attracted to the print on this so
it's a blush pink fabric then you've
also got the metallic star pattern all
over it and I do really like stars I
think this kind of astronomy style print
is very much on trend at the moment and
then similarly you've got a ruffle
detail you can't really see it too
clearly but it's got a bit more of a
ruffle detail finish to the to the
fabric that you wrap around this style
of really lightweight clothing I think
will be perfect for the warm trips we've
got coming up and also because it is
longer it'll work really nicely also for
an evening dress so hopefully very
versatile and something that I'll get a
lot of wear from whizzing back to River
Island I have this pair of shorts which
are really cute very feminine very
affordable as well they have a beautiful
ruffle detail down at the bottom and a
bow style closure
I find that shorts that lightweight
fabric with an elasticated back
especially are amazing for Beach
holidays because they are just so easy
to pull on and off if you do have a
little bit of sunburn as well hopefully
you don't but it's there are something
worse than trying to pull up denim
shorts so this kind of short will always
be a great one for summer holidays I was
on the lookout for something that I
could both tie around my handbag handles
and also put in my hair and I fell in
love with this beautiful silk scarf from
Reese so hopefully that'll be great for
both of the above
also maybe tying around my ponytail
wearing it as a little headband and even
wear as a neck scarf very very versatile
and just I thought the pattern was
beautiful very very simple gorgeous
color beautiful quality materials so
that's a lovely addition to my holiday
accessory collection as well and
speaking of accessories I have two new
pairs of sunglasses these are both from
world duty-free which is by far the best
place to get sunglasses because they're
far more affordable you don't have to
pay the eighty and if you're there
you're probably on route to somewhere
nice and sunny so yeah definitely
recommend checking out those sunglasses
these are from Chloe I actually got
these prior to a ski trip but it's very
excited to wear them on
more summery trips I think they're just
totally ridiculously oversized I love
the color love the shape and I'm beyond
excited to get lots of wear out of those
I also have to say I love these little
cases that they come in I think they are
so smart and then this second pair is
more kind of stereotypical Chloe style
very Coachella vibes hands up who is
bored to death of thing Coachella all
over the Instagram feeds but yeah love
this style of glasses think I look
amazing in the Maldives and in Italy and
Mexico everywhere and yeah they're
actually really nice to look through
they're very rose-tinted I think they're
a lot easier to wear than the other
style and yeah just a great very
statement accessory for the summer a bit
of a random one but I have found the
perfect summer holiday pajamas so I have
this lovely set which i think is 9 which
Savannah Miller is range on designers at
Debenhams I think that's whether from
ya9 Savannah Miller exactly so this is
the top I'm gonna just pop the bottoms
down very lightweight material it's a
mixture of a lovely lace and then very
lightweight I'd say it's Katims and have
a little look oh it's actually viscose
but either way it's still really lovely
and lightweight I'm definitely gonna cut
these hanging straps from them but you
have got adjustable shoulder straps
which means that it's not going to be
hanging too low it'll fit you hopefully
perfectly and as I said really lovely
and light weight for the top and then
the bottoms are equally lovely and
lightweight so they have an elasticated
top so really easy to pull on off saying
that beautiful material and then you've
got a gorgeous lace detail down at the
bottom they should be nice and cropped
as well which means they'll be a little
bit cooler to wear in lovely hot
locations but very affordable really
pretty and just something a little bit
different like your usual kind of
Topshop and River Island pajamas I
thought they were a real lovely treat
from definites so I can't wait to wear
those also from Debenhams this I feel is
a real Beach essential also actually
from the Nine Savannah Miller range this
is a broderie anglaise beach dress the
easiest thing in the world to put on
when you're on holiday over someone
costume what bikini or even just to wear
for a day trip to the Mayan ruins
perhaps really easy to wear beautiful
lightweight material broderie anglaise
and then again it's got this lovely
pleated frill style skirt at the bottom
it's got quite a wide open neckline a
little bit low-cut and then you've got
some button detail down there so this is
gonna be my go-to beach cover-up sure
and also some accessories from debenhams
as well I thought these were really
beautiful pair of shoes very good for
exploring and because they have got a
chunky heel and plenty of straps they're
going to be quite stable for wearing all
day also thought the color was really
lovely and a nice way of getting my
signature shade into my holiday outfits
and then I have this round bag I thought
this one was much better than a lot of
the kind of picnic style bags that you
see because it packs flat so really easy
to pack and then I also really liked the
style of the strap I think it looks like
the kind of thing you pick up in a local
market but actually it was from denims
I'm going to show you through a few
accessories now and not all of these are
particularly holiday focused you can
definitely wear these in your home
country lastly some amazing designer
dupes these are two bags from my
favorite Duke website artists out
anything both of them are amazing dupes
for Cloe handbags of course we have the
Nile bracelet bag do you this is just
the most beautiful quality bag the color
of this is absolutely dreamy works so
well with my wardrobe and a really good
size as well you can fit a lot of your
stuff in there and it's got the back
pocket too and then this is more of a
tube of the Chloe Fay day bag which is
actually a bag that is on my wish list
at the moment so I'm going to see how
much use I get out of this and then if I
think that I would wear it a lot which
already I have been doing then I will
consider getting it the real deal but
for now this is an amazing way of
getting that look for a whole lot less
and also still getting a beautiful
quality bag not a really cheap designer
knockoff this is a bag that I will be
using for my hand luggage it is a Kurt
Geiger handbag but I think this looks a
lot to like the Pradas style bags I have
been lusting over these for quite a long
time because I could have this style on
repeat in their stores in various
different colorways but I saved myself a
lot of money by getting this from Shu
whole XCOM which is basically a Kurt
Geiger Michael Kors and a few other
brands
outlets highly recommend it I have a few
more pieces from them to show you in a
second but this I was so pleased to get
at a discount because it's just perfect
a very classic bag style really roomy
this would make a great everyday or work
bag you've got the zippy pocket in the
middle
it fits my laptop in there perfectly as
well sticking it to the handbag theme
the next one again a bit of a wild card
but one that I thought was really
beautiful is this velvet blue bag from
Kurt Geiger it's got a gorgeous woven
scarf wrapped around the handle and also
mixed in there is this kind of pearly
chain it's very different for me I'd be
very interested to hear you guys opinion
what you think of it but I just thought
it was really unique very different very
eye-catching and quite luxurious and
opulent looking so yeah a wild card but
let me know what you think it's got this
kind of eagle or pigeon style clasp at
the front here and once again really
roomy enough for my cameras my everyday
bits and bobs very spacious inside so it
should be a very very practical one but
then going firmly back to my comfort
zone you guys were spotted this already
on my Instagram and in my blogs my
beautiful new mulberry Seton or Minnie
Seaton handbag this I was so kindly
gifted by the brand which is insane and
I just absolutely adore it it is most
definitely my color it has this
beautiful new style lock for the Mallory
handbag which is very practical inside
it's not the biggest it just about fits
my blogging camera my phone purse
etcetera but not too much else it's also
got as you can see inside the shoulder
strap currently got a pair of my
sunglasses in there as well beautiful
dark blush colored leather gorgeous
quality and I think this just goes with
so many things in my wardrobe so this is
coming with me on all of my trips as
well now I know this is shaping up to be
the longest what's new in my wardrobe
video ever but I think I have saved the
best few pieces till at last I'm gonna
whiz through them but cannot wait to
show you this next piece in particular
and it is this beautiful absolutely
spectacular champagne colored trench
coat or duster coat that I bought from
the common garden restore a couple of
weeks ago absolutely love this I'm so
excited to wear it it just looks so
fabulous
over the top of a very simple outfit or
looks amazing over so many
things I've just charged on with various
outfits from home it's coming with me to
wear during our time in Dallas and I
think this is gonna be my go-to spring
just jacket that instantly uplifts an
outfit I like to wear it with the
matching waistband really cinch it in at
the waist it looks so so dreamy it was
fairly pricey 285 pounds but I think
this is one of those pieces that
instantly makes your outfit look so
fabulous I love how I look when I wear
this and it's just one of those pieces
that makes me so so happy so it was very
much worth the investment for me so
prepare to see a lot of this one another
jacket totally different style this one
is from River Island and it is a faux
suede jacket maybe even real suede
actually and it has this beautiful
tassel detail thought this would be
really fun for Mexico and Dallas in
particular great for just tossing it
over the shoulders for a little bit of
warmth because in both of those places
at this time of year it can get a little
bit chilly in the evenings but I just
thought as a kind of shoulder Cape style
coat this was really gorgeous a very
easy color to wear as well and a lovely
statement piece so that is from River
Island also from River Island this pair
of jeans and I've tried these on with a
few different outfits love how they look
I find that River Island jeans fit
really nicely they have the perfect
amount of stretch in them just trying to
do up this button and then what makes
these so unusual is they have a thrill
detail down at the bottom so they have a
little bit of a kick which doesn't make
some little bit more feminine a bit
different and they look fabulous with a
pair of mule dirt shoes something I know
I'll wear a lot both in Dallas and on
our Italy trip is this beautiful I have
left it open
beautiful dress from Reese I think the
pattern is absolutely gorgeous beautiful
floaty lightweight material and just
really easy to wear I find dresses in
summer are a bit of a dream come true
because it's an instant outfit just pair
it with a beautiful crossbody bag and a
pair of sandals and that is your outfit
done from Topshop I picked up this
jumpsuit now I actually have a pair of
trousers in this material as well which
I love but I thought it was really good
fun that as a jumpsuit especially for
Mexico I really like how it's got before
or like actually eight buttons e-town
down at the front and then again you've
got a waistband to pull in the
silhouette and this could be a really
nice one for
on the beach and also in the evenings
too so hopefully I'll get a lot of use
out of this one from Topshop now this
top from Rhys I have styled with the
white river at River Island charles's
and I think it looks really great with
that it is this beautiful lightweight
blouse in a blush color it's got a
really lovely detail on the sleeves
where you've just got a little bit of
very very subtle pleating not sure if
that's really picking it up and then it
is a sheer lush colored fabric but then
it also has an almost leopard / giraffe
style it's got more velvety pink
material as well quite hard to describe
but absolutely beautiful the more
velvety bits have a real Sheen to them
as well so it's very very eye-catching
beautiful and lightweight so great for
warmer climates when you still need to
look quite smart so if you live
somewhere hot then this would be a
really great work white blouse I have a
few blouses of this style up from River
Island I thought these would be perfect
with denim shorts great for all upcoming
beach trips this is the first one little
tie detail down at the waist and then
it's got pom-poms and beautiful
embroidered section on the sleeves
really nice lightweight cotton material
a little bit cropped perfect for beachy
outfits of the day and then a couple of
smarter dresses this is for the party
that we have at the conference in Dallas
it is from Nealon thread and absolutely
beautiful dress I love that brand so
much very romantic very feminine and I
just love all the detail it's got this
beautiful thrilled lace it's got a
gorgeous embroidered flower pattern all
over it and then you've got the tiered
lace going down to this beautiful finish
at the bottom there so this with a pair
of actually my Valentino metallic
sandals are going to go with this that
is the perfect spring and summer but
fabulous occasion wet dress and needle
and thread also do some slightly more
casual numbers this is a lot more boho
style in a blue shade different from me
and I'm planning on wearing this for
like nice lunches and evening meals in
Mexico beautiful almost like a silk
shawl jet style material with this
printed floral design on it the cuffs on
the sleeves go down to create a
beautiful billowy style sleeve again
you've got a frill down at the bottom
very freely on the top it has got a
little slip dress inside you can imagine
how amazing this is gonna look with
beautiful bronze legs
nice sandals and a gorgeous crossbody
bag can't go shopping for beachy
holidays without picking up a pair of
denim shorts and this is just a perfect
pair from Topshop not too cheeky they
don't go up the bum and give you a very
uncomfortable bottom for the whole day
were just a perfect length these are
from Topshop they were I think around
the 30 pound mark they are the mum style
at denim shorts but as with everything
they'll be linked down below the exact
pair a nice amount of rip without it
being too OTT and yeah just a perfect
classic denim shorts going back to what
I was talking about at the beginning
these are actually also from the Ted
says relaxed collection these are the
trousers I'll be wearing to fly in on a
flight tomorrow which is to Mexico they
are this beautiful satiny silk material
with the elasticated section at the
bottom elasticated section on the sides
so comfortable nice and high waisted and
with the Mia names on per the perfect
traveling outfit so that is my very chic
outfit for plane Jenny and then we're
getting to the last couple of pieces now
a few more accessories this is the
perfect pair of sandals from Kurt Geiger
again from Sheila holux so nicely
discounted from the high street store
but the perfect heel height for wearing
all day every day beautiful suede style
strap and area of the toes and then
they've got this gorgeous scalloped
detail on the toes too perfect color
very neutral and you know when you just
know something is going to get worn so
much over the next couple of months so
that is my lovely new sandals two pairs
of flat sandals I think I'll really save
these for our Maldives trip these are
from Topshop maybe I'll actually take
these to Mexico because they are such
good fun perfect that kind of bohemian
vibe they have this straw style sole and
then a very kind of rough material for
the crisscross effect only 29 pounds so
very affordable whereas these are more
feminine more detailed 35 pounds from
River Island
I find that song star flip-flops really
really comfortable and once again the
color of these and the style is just
very very me so the perfect Beach
accessory another major wildcard but I
thought you know what when experimenting
with trends look to the high street and
River Island have the perfect Valencia
Duke dupes for the ugly shoe trend
they're really heavy I very very
surprised how heavy
but I thought you know what I have to
give this trend to go but I'm not
willing to spend more than 50 pounds so
I went to real island and thought these
would be great funds so not sure if I'll
be taking them on holiday with me but
keep a lookout for me playing around
with this trend from ASOS I picked up
this dress from a brand called for love
and lemons and I wanted to try that
brand for quite a long time after
stalking them incessantly on Instagram
this is a beautiful sheer dress
long-sleeve hopefully will be perfect
style for Mexico it is very very sure as
you can see but then it also has this
bando style dress that you wear
underneath so you're not revealing
everything this was a fairly high price
point so it's gonna have to look pretty
amazing for me to keep it but I'm gonna
give it a try if you don't see any clips
of me wearing it then it means I did
decide to send it back but I thought it
was such a good opportunity to try it on
ASOS with my returns system so yes we
shall see hopefully that would be as
lovely as it looks on their Instagram
feed two more things we have this pair
of high-waisted boyfriend style relaxed
jeans from a source these have got a
gorgeous lace detail down at the bottom
which i think is really lovely way of
making them a bit different bit more
feminine and then they're very high
waisted casual style and I really like
the wash of these as well so great for
here in the UK perfect for a UK spring
outfit and finally cannot believe how
many items I've shown you in today's
video I think I might have set a world
record I have this really fun that cute
little swimming costume from new look I
thought it was a really good view before
the instagramers favorite Lara Bash
it is a white bikini with floral detail
on the edges a really nice kind of thin
strap for around the thigh so hopefully
very flattering and then the bikini top
itself has got the flower detail on it
as well 3d flowers like the lower ones
fraction the price tag so a great little
tube and oh my god
