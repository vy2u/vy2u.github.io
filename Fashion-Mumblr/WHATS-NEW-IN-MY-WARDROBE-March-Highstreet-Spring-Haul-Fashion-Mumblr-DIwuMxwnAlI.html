there ok so I'm going to get started
with a few new pieces from Topshop now
if you guys have been watching my recent
videos you'll know that in fact my last
video was a Topshop haul so these are
actually pieces on top of those pieces
yes I am loving Topshop at the moment
but these are the reason for my new
Topshop purchases I saw these on the
website actually the day that my Topshop
haul went live so I could not resist
them they are basically my dream spring
shoe so yes I made another Topshop order
my Topshop haul will be linked up on and
this side of the screen and also down
below if you'd like to see what else I
bought from Topshop lately but these
shoes
I think you guys will agree with me I
just absolutely define they are pink
leather mules and I love mules I think
they work with so many things whether
that's jeans or crop trousers like the
like the trousers I'm wearing right now
skirts they just work with everything
and these are the most beautiful shade
of pink beautiful soft leather and then
I adore this little round spherical heel
so so cute
these were 62 pounds so they're not the
most affordable shoes to the high street
but I've said it a million times I
really do think Topshop shoes are very
good value for money because they're
beautifully made and not a ridiculous
price tag I know for sure that I wear
these so much over the coming weeks and
months and probably years as well so 62
pounds for me is a pretty good
investment something else which I added
to my basket from Topshop is this pair
of dotty trousers and they have a super
elasticated waist band recently I've
really been getting into kind of casual
trousers but also quite trendy as you
may know I work from home so I spend a
lot of my time in casual clothing but I
want that casual clothing it to look
really nice too so this is a kind of
thing that I will live in also really
good for long-haul flights they are
pleated and the whole fabric is super
super stretchy full-length trousers they
could be quite wide at the bottom like
Palazzo style polka dots if you watch my
spring trends video eight spring trends
you need in your wardrobe then you'll
know that polka dots is a really big
trend at this season so this is
something else I added to my top Shore
order and I also could not resist at
this t-shirt it's got a couple of marks
on at the moment because I just steamed
it so it's a little bit damp but this is
a very plain it was actually in sale
it's one of the top shop premium or
boutique pieces you had Topshop boutique
it was down from 38 pounds to 25 so I
got a bit of a bargain on this one
beautiful color a real classic piece you
will definitely be seeing this in my
classic pieces of your spring wardrobe
video which I'm hoping to film very soon
but something like this it's just a step
up from a normal t-shirt the material on
this it feels a little bit kind of like
a brushed fabric but it's a really
beautiful really lovely material it's
got a gorgeous hang to it I love a
v-neck I think this color is super
flattering so a really good staple piece
for my spring wardrobe now I did
actually mention this one in my last
Topshop haul but I've shown it on
Instagram a few times and so many people
have been like oh my god where's your
bag from so I
I would mention it again this is a round
bag from Topshop it's got the call just
studs on the outside very much has kind
of Chloe pixie bag vibes about it but I
absolutely adore it 28 pounds and it
really is such an instant way to make
your outfit look so so on-trend comes in
a few different colors as well I'll
leave a few color options link down
below but yeah I think this is a really
fabulous accessory and a great
affordable way of making your outfit
very on-trend spring ok these next few
pieces I'm not going to go retailer by
retailer because they're not really in
order behind me these I've actually just
grabbed from the dryer I'm downstairs
because I did have them in the wash but
they are a pair of wide leg knitted
cropped trousers from River Island now I
do have a photo of me wearing these
which I'll pop up on the screen now I'm
also wearing the Topshop bag in that
photo these are another one that I love
to wear when I'm working from home but
also I love how they look so much like
almost want to go out the house if I'm
working from home just to show everyone
how fabulous my casual outfit is so
they're just very very comfortable I
think they look really stylish this kind
of knitted qalaat is really on trend at
the moment the trousers I'm wearing
right now which you can't see are also
knitted culottes from River Island but
the plat detail down the side and I love
them to pieces so these I took with me
skiing hence why they've just come off
the wash and they smell so good yeah
been loving wearing these a lot this
past month something else that I just
grabbed from at the dryer please excuse
their creased nurse but these are a pair
of jeans that I got from French
Connection and as soon as I saw the
material of these I'm not sure how much
you can see but it's if you know what
calico is like it's almost rule kind of
straw-like doesn't sound very appealing
but honestly it's really lovely
effective material it looks just
imperfect it's got little kind of specks
in it and I really like that style
sometimes I think plain white jeans can
be very stark they're quite quite as
statements whereas these I think are a
little bit softer a bit more wearable
but you still get the same effect if
like me you're not a huge fan of dark
colored denim or black and dark colours
in general then this again is a really
good piece to have as a basic in your
spring wardrobe once again last week on
house skiing I wore these with so many
different things whether a knitted
jumper to make it more casual or silk
flowers to smarten up in the evening
I found them very very versatile also
with French Connection
I find the jeans always fit really
beautifully they have a great amount of
elasticity to them so the fit on the
body is really really lovely so if you
not tried French Connection jeans yet
then definitely give it a go okay so
some accessories now just to break
things up and I bought this pair of
sunglasses in world duty-free in the
airport on our way to Salzburg when we
went skiing they are a pair of Chloe
sunglasses and I really wanted to show
you the case because I think the case is
absolutely gorgeous as well so you get
this leather case in the Chloe box and
the sunglasses inside I feel like these
are gonna be definitely a Marmite
products love them or hate them
I think they are amazing and so much fun
that they're absolute ginormous but I
think they're a real statement piece for
spring and summer as well and I
definitely feel a little bit like Nicole
Richie from the sweet life they're very
big on my face but I don't mind that I
think there's such a great statement
sunglasses I've wanted a pair of Chloe
sunglasses for quite some time now and
these I felt were just kind of my
perfect ones I really like this gold bar
on the side and then they've got a
little bit of gold in the top corners as
well which i think is a lovely detail as
well as generally a beautiful soft pink
frame they are designer sunglasses so
they were quite an investment but as you
probably know in world gt4 you don't pay
the v80 or there's other taxes that you
don't pay so much more affordable than
picking them up on a high street so
really chuffed with those absolutely
love them and hoping it at the Sun that
stays out so that I can wear them in the
not-too-distant future as well as the
jeans that I showed you earlier I do
have a few other pieces from French
Connection these are a bit of a
statement piece they are a pair of lace
trousers which is quite crazy but I
thought very much my style and I'm
hoping that if I book a holiday anytime
soon then I'll be able to wear those at
them they are the matching piece to the
top that I'm wearing now which is also
French Connection I've already worn the
top quite a lot I really really love
this detail on the sleeves I think it's
such a gorgeous way of finishing them
off and then the trousers they are wide
all the way down they have a very
similar lace finish on the bottom so you
can see you've got the sculpt lace but
then they have a really lovely sheer
lining there just pokes out underneath
so they give almost like a 60s flared
look so imagine these trousers with this
top with those sunglasses
an amazing outfit so these are quite
wild but very much looking forward to
styling these in the coming months from
the high street I picked up this pair of
floral trousers as I mentioned loving
the comfortable trouser trend at the
moment another pair with an elasticated
waist band and a really simple floral
design these are probably the most black
item I will wear during the springtime
there are black fabric with a very light
blue rose design all over them they do
have pockets which for me and many other
people is a very important design factor
just adds a lovely casual element to
them beautiful lightweight material wide
leg all the way down so another great
piece of spring and for holidays as well
especially during transition seasons
like spring I love to wear skirts with
openiy boots or even with tights this
one from French Connection I thought was
really really beautiful down at the
bottom you have got this lace overlay of
the flowers which just hangs below the
lining so a really lovely effect the
back is quite plain which makes it fit a
lot better to the body it's slightly
more elastic 8 along the back zip
closure this I think would pair really
nicely again with the chunky knit or
with a camisole or perhaps even with a
nice t-shirt like this one if you can
wear what you like to the office and I
think this would make a really lovely
work skirt as well in fact this whole
outfit could be a very chic desk to
Disco kind of outfit speaking of which
this t-shirt is another new end piece
from my wardrobe it is most definitely a
spring basic investment pieces is from
Reis it is a silk t-shirt with these
gorgeous tiny little pearls on the cuffs
of the sleeve which i think is just such
a beautiful design detail other than
that it's a very simple plain t-shirt
every year I feel like there is top in
my wardrobe that just goes with
everything it makes choosing an outfit
in the morning so much easier because
you can always rely on that particular
top and I feel like for me this year
this is definitely going to be the one
another equally wearable top which again
will go with so many different outfit
combinations is this one as you can tell
the label is still in and I have not
worn this one yet but I'm just waiting
for the temperatures to rise it's
basically just a plain kind of camisole
you've got a v-neck the material feels
like silk but it was a lot more
affordable I think it's probably
polyester this is only 25 pounds but
once again a real basic piece for your
spring wardrobe that
know that when the Sun starts to shine
I'll be wearing a lot so I think it was
in about November that I started saying
that I was on the lookout for a pink
corduroy skirt I found a few that I
liked but not the one and I feel like
finally I have found the one that this
one was I think $17.99 or something
crazy like that
yeah $17.99 which is incredible
it looks quite small and quite narrow
but it does fit around the waist so it
is quite a short skirt especially for me
probably the shortest thing in my spring
wardrobe but so affordable and this
again is the kind of piece that I wear
over and over again with my white silk
t-shirt I think there's an outfit right
there perfect the spring super girly and
very very wearable this next one is more
of an investment piece but I think with
tops like this that do make a real
statement it is nice to sometimes invest
a little bit more so you get that
incredible quality this is a lace top
and it is from Reese it's got a
beautiful pleated almost pie crust
detail around the top and then also
pleated this is almost like a silk
rosette material around the sleeves the
quality and the craftsmanship of this
top is absolutely gorgeous
I have worn this a couple of times so
far received so many compliments on it
each time that I've worn it and I think
that lace tops don't ever really go out
of fashion so this spring next spring is
going to be one of those pieces that I
bring into my wardrobe year after year
it's probably a good video idea and that
maybe I'll do a video of looking back at
previous year's investment pieces and
seeing if I still love them let me know
if you'd like to see that or maybe I'll
kind of integrate it into my video where
I switch my wardrobe from winter to
spring let me know what you think but
this top absolutely adore I went for a
size 4 because I do find that I am a 4
in Reese clothing whereas normal stores
I'm a size 6 so that's something to bear
in mind you can definitely size down you
do have to be a little bit conscious of
your underwear with this as well make
sure you wear a nude bra or if you do
have a statement for are or kind of
little top to wear underneath then it
would almost certainly be a little bit
visible underneath at this top so this
dress I have not worn yet but I'm so
excited too because I can just tell it's
gonna be one of those pieces that I
absolutely live in it throughout spring
and summer if I've got any nice dinners
to go to any dates with friends that
kind of thing special events this is
going to be such a go-to piece I mean
it's so me it is absolutely gorgeous it
is a stretchy knitted materials that's
going to be really figure hugging but
then I think a let's call this style of
fit-and-flare because it fits at the
body and then it flares out for the
skirt part of the dress you've got this
kind of like faux pleated detail at the
bottom it's actually just bits of raised
fabric and then the top is slightly more
intricate in that it's got different
directions of the fabric you've got some
swirly details this is really hard to
describe but basically a very textured
bodice to this dress if you guys have
been around here for a while you'll know
that this is so my style and I'm just
gonna wear this so is there so much so
prepared to see this a lot and by the
way a lot of you comment on the way that
I store my clothes on hangers please
don't worry I only store them like this
for the videos and then I put them on
proper less pretty hangers when I put
them in my wardrobe I'm gonna have
another quick break from the rail by
showing you a few more accessories this
is my new designer handbag it is from
Michael Kors and it is actually one of
the pieces they brought out for their
early spring collection I as you know
love florals and pink so this is
basically my dream bag as always I'm
very open with you guys and I will let
you know that this was actually a gift
from the brand I know I'm so so so lucky
and will never take that for granted
because I worked with them on some
content for Mother's Day so I was very
very kindly gifted this bag pinch me
pinch me cannot quite believe it but
yeah I think is absolutely beautiful
you've got these rose gold petals and
floral detail in the middle it does have
a crossbody strap as well so very very
wearable great for shopping days also
that rose gold buckle and then inside
just a very very spacious bag fits so
much into it got a zippy pocket you've
got a little clip here too which is just
great if you've got keys or valuables
and then also a little envelope pocket
and also a little envelope pocket at the
back with a press stud which is great
for any phones or Oyster cards that kind
of thing
so a beautiful new bag to add to my
collection I also bought this pair of
shoes from ASOS and I absolutely did not
need these in the slightest but I could
not resist them because they are such
good in my opinion dupes of these young
Vito Rossi shoes which I do actually
have I have got the rose gold jumpy
Taurasi shoes but I don't
very much clearly don't find them very
comfortable my John Vito Rossi's have
got this perspex going all the way
around the back in fact I'll insert an
overlay here as you can see them whereas
these ones which are a fraction of the
price I think these are under 20 pounds
have got a buckle so this strap goes
around your ankle and then closes you
can make it as big or as small as you
want I think it makes them a lot more
comfortable but with this clear perspex
and transparency is a huge trend this
spring again you'll know that if you
watch my spring trends video and in this
rose gold pointed toe cap makes them so
designer looking and very much a dupe
for the Jan BT Rossi shoes back to the
rail this next one is a dress also from
French Connection very similar material
wise to the skirt I showed you earlier
this one again I haven't tried on yet so
I don't know if I'll be keeping it or
not but I think it's a really lovely
thing to have in your spring wardrobe
for any dinners dinner parties evening
events christenings wedding guest events
that kind of thing it's just a lovely
classic piece to have in the wardrobe it
does have a cold shoulder sleeve effect
you've got also these kind of spaghetti
straps at the top and similarly to the
skirt you have this floral applique a
detail on the front and plain black at
the back so once again really
beautifully fitting to the body next is
a couple of pairs of trousers both from
River Island I'll start off with the
jeans I know I said earlier that I don't
really like dark jeans but I feel like
they are kind of an essential in your
wardrobe and I'm just not happy with any
of the ones in my current collection I
know the river island jeans fit really
nicely again they're really elasticated
so these are just a very classic pair
super-stretch as you can see so very
comfortable other than that just kind of
plain skinny jeans they do have this
ripped detail down at the bottom which I
personally really really like they're
very high-waisted as well so you feel
all tucked in and very flattering on the
bum so yeah these will be my go-to jeans
for the coming months oh I lied these
are actually not from River Island these
are from House of Fraser they are a
brand called ISA and ISA is the brand
that I always think of Kate Middleton
her engagement dress the blue cross over
one was from this brand so it's got two
royal nod of approval these are a pair
of high-waisted palazzo trousers I will
insert a photo of me wearing them here
because I don't think that I can do them
justice holding them up I got these more
with Holly
in mind I think that palazzo trousers
look great on warm holidays they've got
a lovely tie at the waist super wide leg
trousers a little bit sheer so do watch
out with what underwear you wear with
them but yeah very excited to wear these
on my next holiday another high-street
piece this is a skirt that I picked up
from River Island if you saw the video
that I filmed with Freddie which is five
key pieces for your spring wardrobe
you'll have seen that Freddie was
wearing this skirt and I'd actually
already bought it had it on my rail
behind me to talk about but it's just an
absolutely gorgeous very Chanel
esque kind of skirt at a very affordable
price tag I as I said earlier loved
wearing skirts and spring and I think I
might snip off the bottom of this so I
think this kind of ruins the very chic
ladylike effect it kind of makes a
little bit more boho II but this I
absolutely adore and can't wait to wear
absolutely loads
speaking of River Island I also have
this pair of sandals
I couldn't resist these I feel like it
is too early in the year to be buying
this sort of shoe but I knew that if I
didn't pick them up now I would
definitely regret it they are a pair of
almost flat sandals I've got a very low
heel I wish this was rose gold because I
don't have quite so much silver in my
wardrobe but still very very pretty and
then it's got to these gorgeous kind of
3d flowers on the straps they feel
really really lovely quality River
island is another one where the shoes
aren't too expensive but the quality is
really really good I'm not sure when
I'll be wearing these in the UK but
again a really fabulous piece for
upcoming holidays I may have got a
little bit carried away when it comes to
buying summer sandals in March but
couldn't resist these either I thought
they were very very classic they've got
this art eye logo in gold in the middle
and then this is a brown there's a nice
real leather doesn't smell like real
leather faux leather cross over on the
foot and then a nice cushion soles they
should be very comfortable for wearing
all day it's throwing you places or
going shopping with friends in summer
months okay something that I have
already been getting quite a lot of wear
out of
is this dress from Club Monaco it's
unzipped at the moment so it looks a
little bit strange at the back this is
the kind of dress I think that Club
Monaco bring back season after season
such a classic dress and so so beautiful
I have wanted one like this for a long
time when I saw it coming in for spring
I instantly snapped it up you've got
this beautiful scalloped detail on the
neckline and in the same scalloped
detail around the waist as well and of
bottom-4 the skirt which just gives it
such a beautiful feminine feel but again
very classic very professional-looking
this I would most certainly wear to work
if I had an office job I have already
been wearing it for days in town for
meetings things like that at this time
of year it's nice to our little ankle
boots but in the summer I will
definitely wear with wedges with sandals
that kind of thing so this is another
one that you'll be seeing me wearing a
lot over the coming months of the year
next up we have a really beautiful
blouse this has got the kind of
bow detail at the top and then it's the
sleeves which make this really really
interesting I think this looks quite a
lot like a self-portrait blouse but
definitely you know any other price tag
some of the sleeves you've got polka dot
then you've got ruffles then you've got
lace then you've got more polka dot
really really fun sleeves but then the
front of this shirt is a lot more plain
so making it very very wearable and then
you just have the polka dot detail going
across the back here and to wear this I
would probably wear this of jeans to
just kind of make a jeans and a white
top look even more exciting or perhaps
pair it with a midi skirt or even a
miniskirt I think this could be worn
with multiple different skirt lengths a
very versatile piece and to be honest
having a white blouse like this in your
wardrobe is just again a real basic
piece for your spring up collection
another pair of shoes these I could not
resist from Reese they are a light pink
suede material I think this kind of V V
toe area not v-neck Vito area is really
flattering I think it's very on trend at
the moment as well and I did buy the
pair of shoes that Reese did kind of
similar to these last year I can't
remember if they had ankle straps or not
but I wore them absolutely loads so my
go-to shoe for SAR events so when I saw
this year's version I thought that I had
to go for it
really like this detail as well where
the strap goes around the ankle then you
also have my hand there you can see you
also have this strap here which is just
a really nice design element I think
those are the kind of things that you
really do get when you go to the premium
and at the high street the craftsmanship
and these design details you just don't
really get with more affordable designs
so yes a very lovely investment piece
from Reese and while we're speaking of
Reese accessories I also picked up this
bag I think this is gonna be a really
great work bag
super super roomy it's a ginormous bag
really spacious inside
then you've got this zippy pocket here
which I think it's perfect for my laptop
I can open up the whole side here put my
laptop in there really really securely
and then when I'm coming around all my
bits and bobs of the day they can go in
this huge inside section which just
secures here with a big press stud the
accessories in resat the moment are just
amazing as you can probably tell I'm
getting very carried away but this is
another piece that I just could not
resist it definitely has kind of Chloe
vibes about it once again a lot more
affordable but it is a premium High
Street piece so it's not mega mega cheap
but I think that the detail on this one
you can definitely tell that it is worth
that price tag so you've got a flat
clear which also has a magnet here so
it's very very secure inside fairly
roomy you do just have this one that
leather pocket here to pop your card in
I think the design of this and the color
is just so so beautiful and then you've
got this very thin strap which enables
you to wear it crossbody this I have
worn with MIDI skirts
I've worn over the top of trench coat
and once again it's the kind of piece
that just instantly lifts your outfit of
the day this next one I have actually
been tweeting about quite a few times
because I think it is such a divine item
for your spring wardrobe and it is this
pink coat from oasis actually this was
88 pounds so middle of the range price
point wise but I think it's absolutely
gorgeous the color of this is just
absolute color perfection I feel so
lucky right now that my favorite color
is all over the high street hence my
ridiculously big shopping sprees but
this is kind of like an update on a
trench coat so you've got these big
lapels got a lovely big tight the waist
really nice warm material and lining as
well so very warm very practical but a
lovely light color for spring now you
may recognize this material because it
is in fact the same material as the
skirt that I showed you earlier from
River Island but this is in fact a pair
of trousers these again I styled up in
the video that I filmed with Freddie and
she's styled up the lilac pair so
definitely give that a watch I'll pop it
up here if you haven't seen it yet for
some ideas on how to style these but
they're again at this beautiful almost
tweed like material and at the bottom
you've got this gorgeous detail of the
ruffles and then the pearls inside the
ruffles which is so gorgeous I've worn
these I will he's actually on Mother's
Day when we were
walking around town doing fun things
together we went for afternoon tea we
did some shopping we had facials these I
felt worked for all the different things
we're doing throughout the day you could
wear them with flats I think I wore them
with heeled boots on that particular day
so once again a great piece to have in
your spring wardrobe I have another
piece here that I kind of pre bought a
head of summer because I think this is
going to be one of those pieces that we
see all over our instagrams and that
will almost certainly sell out very soon
because it's so affordable this is 30
pounds it is a top from River Island
broderie anglaise style material which I
absolutely adore broderie anglaise like
one of my favorite things in the world
and then you've got the ruffle detail on
the sleeves tie at the waist and then
this very almost rustic style button
there kind of like a tortoiseshell
button this is most definitely a very
much middle of summer holiday piece but
um yeah as I said I bought it early
because I know that I want to wear this
kind of thing when it does heat up but
it'll probably be sold out by that and
so if you love this I would definitely
recommend investing now last couple of
pieces now darlings if you've got this
far you're still with me then well done
this skirt I absolutely adore its from
Reese and it's just the most beautiful
floaty material it looks kind of like a
jellyfish the way that I'm twisting it
now
I love midi skirts I find that I reach
for them so so often I wore this
yesterday to a blogger event in the
evening and insert the photo that I took
here I actually wore this with the top
that I'm wearing now I thought it worked
really beautifully this is a little
different normal midi skirts in that the
pleats kind of widen at the bottom I
think this is called a knife pleat where
they're really thin and then they widen
at the bottom which is just really nice
effect and makes it extra floaty the
last thing on my rail is this coat and I
bought this specifically for our ski
trip I've got it from a source but it's
actually Miss Selfridge I knew that it
wasn't gonna be freezing cold because we
did go skiing in March and it's not as
freezing as it can be other times of
year so I just wanted something that I
could wear out and about that wasn't my
ski jacket this I think I will now pack
away in my skis suitcase for the next
time we go skiing because I think it's
just a little bit too snuggly for
wearing now that we are moving into
spring but I think it's absolutely
gorgeous it's actually reversible as
well I only have the wore it this way
around
so you've got this kind of like faux
sheepskin effect here nice big pockets
but you could also wear it as a super
fluffy coat as well so yeah I got a lot
of use out of this during our time in
Austria last few pieces now I'm not sure
if I showed you this in my last what's
new in my wardrobe video but I will show
you again if I did this is the beautiful
bag which I was very kindly given by
Victoria from in the fro it is for her
collaboration with strawberry absolutely
beautiful bag as you guys know I adore
crossbody bags this is just a perfect
size the craftsmanship on this it's
absolutely divine and the color is so so
dreamy they have unfortunately sold out
I think she has a few the little pouches
left so if you would like to buy a piece
of the collection then I think there are
definitely some little money pouches
still left on the site ok last but not
least you guys probably know that I wear
my Kate Spade
leopard print sunglasses all the time I
love them they are perfect these are
fairly similar they are also from Kate
Spade I love the box they come with as
well and they are probably a little bit
more wearable than mine effort print
ones they're the exact same shapes I
know that the shape really suits my face
they don't have little nodules here so
they're great for if you want to wear
them on top of your head they won't ruin
your ponytail or your bun when you pull
them off so super comfortable to wear
and then these ones instead of being
leopard print they've got like a tour
toys shell detail along at that side and
then they'll plain black at the front so
very very wearable super for this time
of year the Sun is still quite low for
driving for walking around shopping etc
that just really handy to have in your
handbag so these have already been so
well worn this month I've also wore them
as my skiing sunglasses in my helmet as
well so that is everything that is new
in my wardrobe kind of ridiculous there
is so so so much but um yeah March and
April are kind of the months that I go a
little bit crazy because as I've said a
million times I love spring and my
absolute favorite season when it comes

skirts everything that i love in fashion
