me for today's video today it's going to
be the what's new in my wardrobe
February edition so I did this last
month in January and I shared with you
all the bits that have kind of snuck
their way into my wardrobe not in one
particular Hall because I haven't bought
them all at once some of them are gifts
as a result of working with brands some
of them are of course bits that I've
also bought myself but a lot of you
really loved the what's new in my
wardrobe that I published last month so
I thought I would show you again this
month because there are quite a lot of
new pieces we're moving slowly but
surely into spring and it's my favorite
time of year for fashions so naturally a
lot of spring pieces are starting to
make their way into my collection I'm
actually going to get started with
accessories because this month I have
got a few new pieces of jewelry and I
wanted to just give them a little bit of
a spotlight because I do get a lot of
questions about the jewelry that I'm
wearing and it'd be nice to go through
the mall piece by piece just to let you
know what they are I don't tend to buy
loads and loads of jewelry but the
pieces that I do have are all very
classic and I wear pretty much the same
pieces over and over again so let's
start off with my hands so I definitely
should have sprayed on my hands before
showing you but I've got a couple of new
rings this one up here is a new one from
astrodome ooh it has got the little tiny
diamante details on they're very thin
rose gold band a very classic one these
two I've had previously big fans of
those I have one more new ring from
Astrid Amira
this one can be used as a stacking ring
or you could definitely wear it on its
own I'm kind of just piling them all on
to show you but these two ones here are
the two new ones really lovely quality
but not a ridiculous price tag so big
fans of those from Astrid mu and also
from them I have this new long pendant
ostrich mu I have just released their
basics collection so a lot of really
simple pieces in very high-quality
metals they've got sterling silver
yellow gold rose gold plated and I went
for this long
rose gold pendant it looks lovely over
jumpers you can layer it with shorter
necklaces as well like I have done with
this one and if you're wearing something
quite plain a plain white t-shirt or as
I said a knit it's a really lovely way
of just adding a little touch of a
detail to an outfit like that I also
have some new earrings from astrodome
you the ones that I'm wearing
now are probably my favorites this is a
hexagonal ear cuff so basically it's
like a fishhook and you put it through
the ear and then you twist it so that
the hexagons run all the way up the ear
really really effective quite an edgy
look I would say for me but still very
feminine and wearables I'm a huge fan of
my new ear car and then it just has the
matching hexagons to go on the other
side and then I also have some beautiful
new pieces from Monika Vanetta they
recently launched a whole load of new
pieces from their Fiji collection which
I'm absolutely in love with so perfect
for creating wrists stacks
I love stacking and mixing and matching
all my jewelry pieces and these work so
perfectly I kind of thrown them all on
for the sake of this video but at the
top here you can see the Fiji diamond
button bracelets loads little circles
and it's just so so effective and then
it's closed with the traditional Monica
venator rose gold clasp like this the
next one down is a diamond friendship
bracelet you've got little diamonds
going all the way around in pave style
and then this one is the Fiji cuff
bracelet it's just a plain rose gold
band really effective beautiful very
classic piece perfect for engraving if
you want to put a special message on
there and then it's just got the two
little Fiji shapes of the end there and
then on this wrist I've got more of a
traditional Fiji friendship bracelet at
the top here this rose gold band which
again really good for engraving and then
this one has got a little diamond pave
circle on the toggle so those are my new
jewelry pieces which I've been wearing
all day every day throughout the past
few weeks and will continue to be
wearing no doubt throughout pretty much
the rest of spring and summer and then
something else another accessory which
is new to my collection this month that
I have been using all the time is my new
mulberry bag now you may have recently
seen my what's in my handbag video where
I go into a little bit more detail kind
of reviewing the bag and showing you all
what's inside it which is rather a lot
of bits and bobs and I just carry around
with me all the time so absolutely
smitten with this bag it is a perfect
bag for everyday if it's my laptop it's
my cameras all the things that I need
all day every day so this is a very
exciting thing that is new to my water
over this month
and then as you can see from the rail
behind me I have quite a lot of lovely
pastel colored items so very much
getting into the spring vibe for my
wardrobe although I do wear past month
all year round but I've kind of
separated this by retailer so I'm gonna
get started with this jumper which I'm
sure you guys will have seen quite a
lots of them wearing this loads on my
Instagram in vlogs in my romantic
lookbook video and this is from French
Connection if you saw my video last
Sunday about spring trends you ever
notice that I mentioned how sheer fabric
is a real trend that we're going to be
seeing a lot of this spring this has a
lovely sheer panel and sleeves so very
nice way of nodding to that trend and
then beautiful floral applique as well
I've been styling this a lot with
high-waisted skirts and also with pastel
colored trousers and even with jeans it
just looks so stunning and I'm not
usually a huge fan of v-necks but I've
been using a mist spray tan to just make
sure my chest area is nice and bronzed
and then with a lovely delicate necklace
one or two necklaces layered up this
just look absolutely beautiful
so huge fan of this that's definitely a
favorite piece in my wardrobe also from
French Connection I always find that
they have such lovely knitwear is this
bubble jumper I think that it's such a
fun design it's got almost 3d circle
material and really lovely 3/4 sleeves I
find this length of sleeves is really
practical you never get your sleeves in
your food or whatever and also it
doesn't mean that you can see your
bracelets which is really lovely
especially if you do have a fabulous
cluster like these ones and then I
haven't actually woundes yet because I
feel like they are very spring and
whereas and we're still a little bit too
chilly for them but this is a pair of
3/4 length clots from French Connection
they finish it just above my ankles and
down there they've got this lovely
ladder detail you can kind of see my
hand poking through at the bottom there
which is just a really nice design
detail at the back they do have an
elasticated section so very very
comfortable but also a zip to get them
on and off so very easy to pop them on
and off for traveling these would be
really great lightweight trousers
wearing on airplanes things like that
and if you do have any spring weekend
breaks to any lovely European cities for
example
these would be really lovely for that I
think I'd probably wear these a lot with
my Nicholas Kirkwood flat shoes also
with wedge sandals so I'm very excited
with the temperatures to increase so
that I can wear my new lovely floral
trousers
before I forget as well at the outfit
that I'm wearing right now you can't see
my trousers but they are super
comfortable cream rousers with a almost
like a plat detail going down the side
of them they're white knitted material
and then they are culottes
so just super comfortable I think they
look really great as well and I've been
wearing them around the house with this
jumper as my kind of working from home
cozy but still quite chic outfit both of
them super affordable perfect for
lounging around the house in this is
actually from Dorothy Perkins I love the
color of this love how it hangs it's
just such a comfy piece it's also quite
lightweight so for example like today
when I've got the heating on and I've
got all the lights on it's actually
quite warm in the house despite it being
chilly outside so this is just the
perfect thickness for that and I think
the color is absolutely adorable so this
is what I've been buying so this is what
I've been living in when I'm working
from home for the past few weeks
sticking it to the pink pastel theme I
have a new coat this one is Tularosa
from revolve and it is just such a
snuggly piece I'm most definitely not
ready to say goodbye to the cozy
material trend just yet and because this
one is cropped I just find it very
versatile I pop it on over a casual
outfit such as with jeans or I just pop
it on around my shoulders if it gets a
little bit chilly in the evenings it is
so scrumptious ly soft and such a
beautiful color so this is a really nice
snuggly one for my spring wardrobe and
then we move on it to one of my
favorites Reese I have quite a few new
pieces for Reese Reese pieces and you
guys have seen me wearing them quite a
lot already but I'm going to run through
them anyway so we have firstly got this
pair of trousers and I featured these
quite a few times on my Instagram they
are very very versatile with a white net
or with a lovely oversized t-shirt they
just look so gorgeous
they're very stretchy as well so super
comfortable if you're able to wear
pastel colors for work they would make
the most beautiful comfortable and very
sophisticated work trousers as well
definitely wants to try and I think
you'd be surprised with how many things
this style if chose would go with it so
that's the first thing
that I have from Rhys the next is a midi
skirt and I think you guys all know how
much I adore my pleated midi skirts this
is in a metallic silver color once again
I have already worn this absolutely
loads it fits just around the waist so
very very flattering and leg lengthening
and then at the bottom of it is kind of
halfway between the knee and the ankle
so great for showing off any statement
shoes this next piece has been a real
favorite I absolutely adore this coat
from Rhys it is a pestle almost lilac II
pink verging on blushy gray shade I
don't know how to describe this color
but it's absolutely beautiful
this is a prime example of how fabulous
reefs are when it comes to tailoring the
way that this has been cut the fabric
that I've chosen just really shows off
their expertise when it comes to making
products that fit the body so
beautifully and have the most elegant
hang to them it is an investment piece
but so classic absolutely timeless so
feminine very much my style so I was
more than happy to invest in this one
because it is a type of piece I'll wear
over and over again year after year and
then a final piece of outerwear that
again I'm sure if you follow me on
Instagram or have seen my outfit diary
videos you'll have seen me wearing this
a lot it is a check coat again from
Reiss beautifully tailored beautiful
material the details on this are
absolute stunning
it's colorless which i think is a really
nice kind of modern contemporary way to
wear a classic coat personally I really
like how this looks just thrown over the
shoulders not necessarily worn properly
but equally when you tie it in at the
waist it creates the most beautiful
feminine hourglass silhouette and it's
just a fabulous way of instantly adding
the check trend into your wardrobe your
outfit come you super plain that you pop
this on and you feel instantly fabulous
next we move on to Karen Millen and I
worked with Karen Millen at the end of
last month for some videos for their
channel I'll leave that video linked
down below I'm basically discussing lots
of the spring trends with the Karen
Millen team it's a really fun one so go
and check that out
and as a result of that collaboration I
have a few new pieces from the brand the
one that I have worn the most is this
jumper dress I say jumper dress it's not
like a typical jumper dress it's very
practical
great for work I've been wearing this on
days and I'm going out for meetings and
then
maybe I have something to attend in the
evening as well it's the kind of piece
in your wardrobe you just throw it on
and that's your outfit done so so part
for X it's got this really lovely black
and white detailed skirt at the bottom
which slightly flares out and then a
beautiful fitted top in plain black so
if you have to wear something quite
smart but you want to be still really
feminine and elegant for work this looks
absolutely beautiful with tights over
knee boots I actually wore it with these
sock boots which are also from Karen
Millen new in my wardrobe these are the
most incredible boots so versatile sock
boots are very much a trend for spring I
definitely didn't want to invest all the
way in the Valencia ger ones I've heard
very mixed reviews about these but I did
want to get a very good quality pair of
socks boots so Karen Millen is the
absolute perfect middle ground for that
and then we have the most amazing high
waisted suede skirt you guys know how
much I absolutely adore suede skirts a
real staple in my wardrobe I love
pairing them with cream knits fluffy
jumpers silk t-shirts everything so many
things go with the suede skirt and I
just think they are such a staple in any
girl's wardrobe this is my new one from
Karen Millen if you've seen my outfit
Diaries you'll have seen how this fits
really high-waisted so very very
flattering really makes you nips in at
the waist such a gorgeous feminine
silhouette and this sand color is so so
versatile it works with so many of the
knits in my wardrobe and I have got a
lot of use out of this since I got this
a couple of weeks ago and lastly from
Karen Millen this pair of faux leather
and elasticated material trousers now
what I love about these is the fact that
they do have the elastic panel at the
back which means the way that they fit
the body is absolutely perfect really
snug to the leg very very flattering and
yet you still get the effect of leather
trousers thanks to this faux leather
panel down at the front these may not be
very spring-like with the black color
but it's such a classic thing to have in
your wardrobe and once again the kind of
item that year after year I'll just keep
on reaching for and finding new ways to
wear a few high-street pieces next and
once again if you saw my romantic
lookbook you'll have already spotted
this it is a pink
tweed effect skirt from River Island
with this lovely ruffle detail running
through it it's quite short but I think
because of the style of material it's
very elegant very ladylike
can wear this with over new boots or if
you're dressing it up people
wear it with some sandals I think I
walked with my Valentino Rock stood
shoes in the romantic lookbook and when
I saw it on the website I just thought
it was a very me piece so very glad to
have this one in my collection I also
have a new robe style coat from River
Island they tend to bring out coats like
this every springtime and I always get
one because it really is the kind of
thing that you find yourself reaching
for so so often you know and you just
want something to throw on over your
shoulders not give you tons and tons of
warmth but just something to snuggle up
into and still quite a relaxed style
this is absolutely that I've had the
past two years versions last year it was
like a sand color but slightly more
knitted and the year before that really
was like a grey dressing-gown this year
it's more of it's quite a rustic
material almost like calico in this very
very wearable beige color again you've
got the tie in at the waist and it is
quite long this will go to just below my
knees between my knees and my ankles and
then price-wise this was 68 pounds so
the price per wear on this one is going
to be really really good
you've got rose gold details poppers on
the shoulders and then little pockets
here which is great for just popping
your coins in or your house keys if
you're just dashing out a very versatile
jacket that no doubt you'll be seeing me
getting a lot of wear out of and then
something that I've already got tons of
use from from River Island is this cable
knit jumper I love high net cave on it
jumpers and in white or cream so so
classic whether I'm going out for
meetings or just spending the day in the
house I've been reaching for this so
much you really can't go wrong with a
classic knit like this pop of thermal
underneath but if it's cold or just roll
up the sleeves wear it with I don't know
some cropped denim trousers on a spring
day and you have a very classic spring
outfit so I know a lot of you guys
absolutely loved the trench coat that I
mentioned from River Island and it was
limited edition it did sell out which
I'm very very sorry because I know so
many of you loved it but I wanted to
show you this jacket which is a new
trench coat from Dorothy Perkins very
affordable at 49 pounds and I thought
this again was a really fabulous high
street trench coat the river island one
was a little bit more expensive had
slightly more design details but if you
are looking for a classic trench coat
from the high street this one I think is
absolutely beautiful
I recently
this new jumper dress from ASOS as well
jump addresses and over knee boots is
pretty much my spring uniform I haven't
worn this one out of the house yet in
fact I might put it on to go out this
afternoon yeah this is from a source
very simple chevron print in a plain
white knit just generally a really
classic piece that you know that you'll
reach for time and time again I forgot
to mention this handbag when I was going
through the river island pieces but this
I also ordered from the river island
website I've actually had my eye on the
Prada straw bag for quite a long time
but as you guys may know when it comes
to designer statement pieces or designer
pieces in general I'll tend to buy a
more affordable version of it first just
to see how much wear I get from it
before deciding to invest in the real
deal so when I saw this but it was very
very similar to the vibe of the Prada
bag it's got the fringe detail which is
very much on trend you've got this quite
natural calico effect and then straw and
studs down the side it's a really really
beautiful bag I'm gonna be taking this
on upcoming holidays seeing how well it
works in my holiday wardrobe maybe I'll
invest in the Prada one but to be honest
I love this so much I think this will
definitely satisfy my craving for a
straw effect bag next I have some really
lovely classic pieces from LK Bennett
okay Bennett is along the same price
lines as Karen Millen Rees kind of
brands I absolutely love real premium
High Street investment pieces that are
so classic that you're where time and
time again so the kind of retailer to go
to when it does come to those very
classic timeless pieces such as this I
don't know how many times I've mentioned
a cream knit or a white knit going with
a high-waisted skirt or another skirt
things like that
suede skirts this kind of knit goes with
so many things so this one from LK
Bennett is absolutely perfect I've
already worn it absolutely loads of so
many different outfit combinations
beautiful soft material this is a
hundred percent wool so really lovely
quality and just such a classic piece I
think every spring wardrobe needs a
classic knit like this and this one from
LK Bennett it's absolutely perfect
something that I have been styling it
with from the same brand is this skirt I
am a huge fan of tweed skirts I think
this one is a real Chanel or cher
Horowitz vibe to it I love the black
stitching over the pockets and then this
little button detail this is a size six
and it's actually still a little bit big
for me so I'm planning on taking this
one at two
Tayler or sing if my mum can do anything
with it because I think with this kind
of skirt it really needs to fit you so
perfectly around the waist we'd
recommend sizing it down with these I
think again perfect for a work wardrobe
or if you have a really classic feminine
style like me it is a really really
gorgeous one to have in your spring
wardrobe and then another classic piece
from LK Bennett is this beautiful blouse
hopefully you can see the design detail
on this you've got these gorgeous almost
oversized quite masculine hems on the
sleeves colonist with just a very simple
button to secure at the top and then at
the back you've just got this one dart
running through a really elegant very
simple design very versatile great for
work great for afternoon teas or lunch
with friends just again a beautiful very
classic timeless piece for the Wardrobe
you'll notice I've said classic and
timeless about 10 million times in this
video that I couldn't made a great
drinking game but that's really what my
star is all about I'm very happy to
invest in pieces when they are classic
when they are timeless because you just
find yourself wearing them time and time
again and I find choosing outfits
putting out this together is so much
easier when I have so many good quality
basics or classic pieces in my wardrobe
so hopefully you guys will have picked
that up from things that I've been
showing you I do have a couple more
accessories to finish off with not quite
so classic and timeless but I thought
these boots from Topshop was so fun as
we go into spring I'll be wearing a lot
more cropped jeans cropped above the
ankle and I think it's great to have
some real statement shoes just peeking
out from underneath so I got these
pastel pink is a real big trend for
spring and I thought these just
absolutely nailed that one
I love pointed toe boots I find them
very comfortable and still really
flattering I love the height of these I
think the heel height is really
practical as well and these were 89
pounds so not super cheap but I think
you get what you pay for when it comes
to Footwear but not ridiculously
expensive either which is great because
they are quite a statement bold Footwear
choice these boots from LK Bennett I
have worn so much they are a little bit
different to my usual over knee boots
because they finish just under the knee
but super super flattering great for
this time of year great with skirts
great over pale colored trousers they
are almost like a lilac II browny shade
very very versatile great heel height as
well so you'll have seen me wearing
these a lot over on insta
or ID and finally once again from lk
bennett is this beautiful handbag this
is the most gorgeous lightweight handbag
so good for work so good as an everyday
bag it's got leather super soft buttery
leather running around the front and
back
suede details at the side I cannot even
tell you how light this bag is if you're
a fan of light handbags you don't
anything too heavy on your arm this one
is amazing and we have finally reached
the end so many amazing new pieces I
really hope you enjoyed looking through
them with me let me know in the comments
