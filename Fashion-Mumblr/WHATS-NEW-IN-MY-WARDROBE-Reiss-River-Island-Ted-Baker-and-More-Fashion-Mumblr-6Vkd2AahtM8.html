a fab day so far and fabulous January so
far today's video is going to be a
what's new in my wardrobe January
edition there have been quite a lot of
new things in my wardrobe since I would
say just before Christmas that I haven't
got to share with you I didn't film too
much over Christmas that are a few
things from that time things that I
didn't show you in my January sales haul
video because they weren't from the
sales but also I didn't want to call
this video a hole because firstly I
didn't buy everything all in one go
because obviously a few of them are
slightly higher price points I don't
tend to haul from premium or luxury
retailers and also because a couple of
these were actually gifts from brands
I'm always going to be totally honest
and upfront with you when things have
been gifted so it didn't feel right to
call this a whole video but I did want
to share with you the new things are in
my wardrobe that would be quite an
interesting one and a lot of you when I
featured something on Instagram I know a
lot of you that subscribe to my youtube
also follow on Instagram for outfit
inspiration you like to have seen it in
a whole videos before so maybe if you've
already got it you know how to style it
etc etc so yeah hopefully this video
will be fun and useful if you like this
idea and you'd like to see what's new in
my wardrobe videos each month then
please do give a thumbs up and let me
know in the comment section below if
that's something you like to see and
your wish is my command
alright so let's get started with some
bits that I purchased over the Christmas
period this is a gorgeous dress from Ted
Baker and now Ted Baker as I'm sure you
know is one of my favorite brands
they're often my go-to when it comes to
occasion where if I've got I don't know
like an engagement party or a wedding or
just something fabulous to go to then
Ted Baker is often my go-to retailer
this is the dress that I purchased
because I wanted to wear it on Christmas
Day it's very much my style but also
it's expandable it's quite stretchy so
it was great for all that roast turkey
dinner and on Christmas Day we do like
to get quite dressed up so I thought
this was just absolute perfect
it's got fluted sleeves it's really
elegant length it came to just below my
knees looked really gorgeous with my
Valentino Rockstar shoes that was the
perfect combination and I got so many
compliments when I was wearing this I
also wore this recently I've looked
about it on Monday actually when I went
to stay at the Savoy for the BAFTA
nomination party and loads of you loved
it and wanted to know where it was from
so now you know the
beautiful dress is Ted Baker and that's
one of the things I added to my wardrobe
last month something else that kind of
snuck into my Instagram photos that I
haven't featured properly on a video
before are these beautiful shoes now
these were gifted these are from and
other stories they're these gorgeous
velvet pink pointed toe sandals with a
fluffy strap around the ankle they're so
fun they're an instant kind of
conversation point they really give an
outfit of a super fun finish so I
absolutely adore them great heel height
too nice and comfortable and I did wear
these too quite a lot of events over the
Christmas period and a couple more new
accessories that I got as a result of a
collaboration that I did with Aspen all
these two bags which I absolutely adore
this one you may know that I have
something quite similar something in
more a caramel kind of leather
it's the Aspen or trunk bag these I
think is such an instant way to make
your outfit look absolutely gorgeous
there are real striking statement piece
and just so so beautiful I love how the
outfit looks like a gray coat with this
over the top is just so beautiful for
the days that I want to look a little
bit more smart polished professional
than I've been going for this bag I
can't remember the name of it
unfortunately but I will leave it linked
down below with all the information
everything that I mentioned this video
including why I'm wearing etc will it
all be linked down below so just check
the description box for all the info you
need but this is a great size handbag I
think it looks really professional it's
got this gorgeous leopard detail just
very subtly on the top handle and on the
clasp Pierre that signature Aspinall
push lot and then inside you've got a
crossbody strap a secure zip section as
well and a few different pockets which
just make this a very very practical
everyday handbag so next I'm going to
switch to a few pieces that I bought
this month firstly this coat from Reiss
you guys will probably have already seen
this on my Instagram I've already worn
it absolutely loads I spoke about this
quite a bit in Sunday's video as well
which was all about how to find your
personal style and why you should invest
in pieces like this so no regrets with
this one it's a gorgeous coat it's a
kind of thing that I know that because
it fits my personal style so well I'll
be wearing this year after year and it
really is a timeless piece so that it's
just absolute gorgeous prepare to see
this a lot over on Instagram and in the
same order I got this suede skirt I wear
suede skirts a lot and yet I didn't have
any little red premium and then I'd
actually invested in so this one was a
higher price point than the existing
side skirts and
wardrobe but because I wear suede skirt
so much I knew I'd get a lot of use out
of it
and already I have a few real favorite
go-to outfits that feature this
including this with one of the gray
cashmere tops from Club Monaco that I
got in sale - this is another piece that
I know I'll be wearing a lot in the
coming weeks months and probably years
as well this is also a mini unboxing I
haven't even opened this one yet but I
got this when I did my little
net-a-porter sale haul and I showed you
everything that I got in the sale in my
January sales haul video these were not
in a sale but I bought a pair of C by
Cloe shoes last year all them absolutely
loads felt they were a really good price
per wear so I've treated myself again at
this year and this is the shoe that I
went for obviously I'm not going to
wearing it for a little while I don't
currently have any hot holidays planned
but today are a pair of wedge sandals
now I don't have a pair of wedge sandals
that have a really good heel height in
my wardrobe I find myself wishing I did
on so many occasions on holiday so when
I saw these they're a pretty good price
point like I would expect Cloe shoes to
be around the six seven eight hundred
pound mark these were closer to the 200
pound mark so for Chloe's shoes I
thought they were pretty good price
point you've got this beautiful pink
scarlet floral detail on the top here
for blush colored leather around the
ankle strap and they're really good heel
high this is going to give me such a
high boost but then this almost foamy
sole I think all mean that they're super
comfortable to walk in I will be wearing
these around the house just to check
that I can walk in them before deciding
whether or not to keep them a few high
street purchases as well I picked up
this coat from River Island now I know
you're thinking it's very very similar
to the Reiss coat I actually bought it
to really compare the two I knew I
wanted to get a new camel coat in my
wardrobe that didn't have the waist belt
like my caramel and want something a
little bit more kind of boxy slightly
more and masculine style so I bought
this one and the Reese one to compare
the two price point wise this one is 85
I'm not 100% sure of the Reese one but
it will have been at least a kind of 280
pound price mark so a lot more expensive
but then as I said I will wear the camel
coat a lot so price per wear should come
down really far I may return this one
I'm not a hundred percent sure I think
that even if I did keep this then I was
still wearing a lot maybe I'm starting
on casual occasions but not entirely
sure yet let me know your thoughts down
below something else from River Island
and I was actually inspired by this by
another Instagrammer lorna lux is the
instrument that inspired me to get this
one she has an amazing fashion sense
actually a really different fashion
sense to me she's very kind of fashion
blogger editor style chic totally
different to my own style but I saw her
wearing this and she looked incredible
in it so I picked this one up from River
Island it has got almost like how you
would twist bread that kind of blood did
style down the sleeves but other than
that it's kind of a plain cream jumper
super soft snuggling material just kind
of thing you reach for time and time
again at this time of year so I'm very
very pleased with it this one I've been
pairing this with the Kate Spade leopard
print trousers that I got in the January
sales and that's one of my favorite
outfits at the moment another cream knit
because I do find myself wearing cream
knits a lot at this time of year this
one is from Topshop and it's a little
bit more feminine it's got a floral
embroidery detail in the middle here
which I absolutely love other than that
again quite plain it's got kind of
grandpa's style cuffs at the bottom
there that same detail around the
neckline and this again works really
nicely with skirts it's a really cozy
outfit if you pair this with jeans
things like that it's just a really
versatile thing to have in your wardrobe
at this time of year this one I kind of
just got really excited about and added
it to my basket this is from River
Island and it is their new style of
suede jacket so I got their style like
this last year it didn't have such a
waterfall detail but I wore that jacket
so much you guys absolutely loved it so
I thought I would treat myself to this
year's version this I think I'll wear a
lot more in spring it's too cold for
this at the moment but when I saw it I
thought you know what that's gonna sell
out and not be in the shops in
springtime so I'm going to invest in it
right now it was 60 pounds and
considering how much I wore last year's
version the price per wellness it's
gonna be really really good it's also
got some lovely details a very very
light gold coating on these zips and
you've also got the zips on these
sleeves and then the same very light
gold detail on the studs up here so just
really nice design details that River
Island often surprised you with also
from River Island and I've really
surprised myself with how much I've been
wearing these I got these boots now
these are kind of inspired by Julia
angle from girl meets lamb she did a
collaboration with an American shoe
company and pulled out some boots like
this
I loved her ones but I don't think it
was very logistic really good
shipping wise so when I saw these in
ravine and I was like yes perfect I will
wear them so much for like walking the
dogs or if I just want to be comfy for a
days something around town doing
meetings things like that they're the
perfect combination between practical
and fashionable so light pink boots
really good grippy sole and then you've
got this faux fur detail on the tongue
which just makes them a little bit more
fun I've paired these so far with white
jeans I've worn with white jeans and a
jumper which is a fairly similar color
to this and it was really really cute
outfit and then the last thing that I
got in my little river island haul was
this trench coat I think that the
perfect classic trench coat on the high
street is really hard to find so when I
saw this one in River Island
I thought they have absolutely nailed it
but details on this are exactly what
you'd expect on a high-end trench you've
got this kind of mortal detail on the
buttons and if you can see that it's
like the kind of detail that you'd
expect to see on a Burberry coat and
then unlike so many affordable trench
coats that just go really wrong when it
comes to the details and the metal this
has got to that light gold again detail
on the metal on the collar and on the
waist felt so well done provide and you
have nailed the perfect high street
trench coat trenches are just such an
essential at this time of year
especially if you live in the UK pull
this in at the waist at a burberry scarf
to this if you want people to think your
coat it's Burberry which it definitely
could pass hours or just any kind of
scarf chic handbag and this is a perfect
perfect iconic London look this is 65
pounds and it's also cotton which means
that if you get a bit of mud on it
lipstick whatever you can stick this in
the washing machine and you're just
saving yourself a ton when it comes to
dry-cleaning bills so if you're yet to
have a trench coat the absolutely adore
in your wardrobe then highly highly
recommend this one as I said it will be
linked down below I have a couple of new
pairs of shoes from Nicholas Kirkwood
and these I actually purchased or part
purchased with a voucher that I had for
far fetch now if you saw my most worn in
2017 video then you'll know that one of
the pairs of shoes I wore the most when
my Nicholas Kirkwood gold flats and as I
mentioned in that video Dickens actually
chewed them so I thought you know what I
want so much and I know that I can I
still love them so much I want to treat
myself to a new pair though in the other
box I have a new girl
but I also treated myself to this color
because it is my dream color beautiful
blush pink slightly more gray almost
purpley so it should go in a lot of my
outfits and these are just most
comfortable flat shoes you will ever try
because I slip on they're just so easy
to slip on and wear amazing for
traveling amazing in spring/summer when
you just want to add something really
cute to finish off your outfit and I'm
just so happy and excited to have a new
color as well as a new Gold pair in my
wardrobe in case you don't have a clue
what I'm on about this is the gold pair
these are my new ones obviously are in
certain overlay here of the new ones
next to the old one so you can see how
well-loved and battered my old ones are
but these are literally my favorite
shoes in the entire world I wore mine so
so much last year they're totally
battered up now but I still wear them
even though they're battered but I'm
really thrilled to have a new pair of my
Nicholas Kirkwood absolute favorite
shoes in my wardrobe so let's move on
quickly to some new Ted Baker pieces in
my wardrobe I collaborated with him
recently for a project on Instagram so
most of these pieces were gifted so so
kindly pinch me pinch me from the brand
firstly this jumper which i think is so
my style
it's a gorgeous soft white knits and
then down the sleeves you have got this
lace detail because of how plain and
simple this is I find it works
beautifully tucked into skirts whether
that's embroidered skirts high-waisted
skirts I paired this with another piece
that I recently got from Ted Baker which
is this skirt this outfit combination is
a real favorite at the moment really
kind of sums up my personal style it's
their two new pieces that I absolutely
adore also for that same project I was
lucky enough to get this coat which is
just kind of becoming my dream winter
coat I've worn this so much since I shot
it and I get so many compliments each
and every time it's just a really nice
update on the classic winter coat
because of this purpley tartan pattern
it just is slightly more striking and
statement than a plain and perhaps camel
coat it's so warm it's a really nice
occasion code if you want to wear
something a little bit smart or if
you've got an event to go to then this
is just the absolute perfect perfect
coat and a couple of accessories to
complete the look from Ted Baker this
bag is one of my favorites from the
shoot it's got this beautiful bow detail
a long rose gold strap inside which
means you can wear it crossbody and what
I just love about
Baker is all the details are rose gold
so you've got rose gold from Eclipse
rose gold inside the bow even the press
studs that magnetized to close it all
rose gold and then you also get the fun
details like the amazing bold pattern
inside and you also find that fun print
inside the coats too it's just these
little details from Ted Baker they
absolutely adore and finally from that
shoot I have a new pair of shoes these I
think are the Ted Baker brooch shoes I
want to say they are a beautiful pink
velvet not too dissimilar to the ones
from and other stories and then they've
got this incredible embellished detail
on the toe which I think makes them look
very Manolo Blahnik style they've got
rose gold heel a rose gold bow here and
these I have got them proudly on display
in my wardrobe so that I can always see
them whenever I go into my wardrobe room
I can see these shoes they're just so
beautiful
I didn't want to put them away so
absolutely love those and the last few
pieces now I picked up this plain polo
top is literally arrived yesterday this
is from Tory Burch I was on the website
browsing sale pieces and I saw this and
I thought it was a good price for
something that I know I always so so
much I've got classic black polo neck
tops but not classic cream ones and this
is just the most beautiful soft material
it's got a nice bit of stretch to it as
well so hopefully should be really
comfortable and because it is a premium
retailer Tory Burch you know it's just
going to be the most super quality and
last season after season ever since
shopping from the Kate Spade sale for
the January sales I realized how easy it
is to order from their website it's
uk-based so no customs don't know why
but I just presume that because it was
an American brand I'd have to get it
shipped from the UK from the US rather
but now that I know that it's not that
way and everything arrives in like two
days with no customs
it's quite dangerous so I have bought a
few pieces from the Kate Spade website
this I'm really annoyed because I
actually accidentally ordered a size two
when I should have ordered a size zero
its American sizes and I'm gonna see how
this looks on and kind of pin it in to
see whether I'm going to exchange or
just return this during the winter
months I'm always looking for things
that can replace jeans I just find jeans
pretty boring and uninspiring at this
time of year so what I like to do
instead is when roll neck tops such as
this new one from Tory Burch with skirts
and I find that that's actually a really
easy outfit to put together and looks a
whole lot more stylish than jeans so
that
that I bought this for I could also wear
this for black tights and black over
knee boots on slightly chillier days
I've also been looking for some slightly
smarter pieces for more of a work wear
wardrobe and I thought these were
absolutely perfect for that they're a
pair of very plain black trousers so
really good to wear in the office but
then they've also got this floral
embroidery hopefully you can see that
and let's see floral embroidery just
down that middle seam it's quite hard
for the camera to pick it up and if like
me you just love to see this refund
feminine detail on what could otherwise
be a very plain item then you'll really
appreciate how cute they are
and then lastly from Kate Spade I saw
this skirt and thought it was just
absolutely gorgeous as I mentioned
previously I love wearing high-waisted
midi-length skirts I just think that's
such a great way of me representing my
personal style and this one I think is
the gorgeous I love this star print I
love the fact that it's kind of multi
tiered and I just adore this sheer
overlay once again with the tory burch
roll neck I think this is going to be a
really beautiful super feminine winter
style and then I just have a couple more
pieces these are the last two from
Topshop that were hiding away in the
background first of all this green coat
so this I again box I thought it was a
bit of a tube for my race coat probably
a little bit weird that I buy Jeeps for
my own wardrobe but I persuade myself
that it's research for when I do my tube
videos for you but if you know the coat
that I'm talking about the Reis car key
colored coat I adore that coat war it's
so so much over the winter still
absolutely loving it and I thought this
was a really good high street dupe to
that one and then similar motivation to
the Kate Spade skirt I picked this skirt
up from Topshop again with the idea of
wearing it with a roll neck top probably
you could get away with a black roll
neck and certainly a cream roll neck
over new boots truck on a beautiful
camel colored coat over the top and
there is a simple winter outfit that's
just totally cute and stylish and really
easy to put together this one is almost
like a kind of curtain material very
granny chic and then you've got the
again really nice buttons these are that
kind of total shell style buttons which
i think is a really lovely design detail
makes it look a little bit more high-end
and it's a beautiful high waisted design
too so it should be nice and leg length
and super flattering so those are the
pieces that are new in my wardrobe for
January I really really hope you enjoyed
looking through these
me and if you want to see how I'm
styling them hime wearing them then make
