first day of vlogmas this is my first
attempt at doing vlogmas that was my new
tube this time last year I did rocktober
and really enjoyed it and of you guys
asked me Steve rockness so here we are
today is actually not problems today is
actually not the first day of December
because I really wanted to get a video
up on the first day of December so it's
the end of November today but I thought
I would film today because I'm doing
something really fun and festive with my
mom and a couple of her friends I
thought be a good and a good day to film
and to vlog and take you along with me
and it's really festive so it's going to
be a really good way to kick off vlogmas
so I'm about to leave home in a second
I'll quickly show you what I'm wearing
but first I have a little announcement
so I may have hinted on Twitter but
basically I'm only doing the twelve days
of vlogmas giveaway which means that
from today up until the 12th of December
I'm gonna be giving away a prize or a
bundle of prizes in every single vlog
leading up to it
so the prizes are going to get better
and better in my opinion as the days go
on so on the 12th of December you'll be
getting like a massive bundle of goodies
so let me show you what I've got to give
away in today's vlog so the lucky winner
is going to be receiving this which is
an advent calendar from earlier I
actually had two of these to give away
and I already gave away oh there we go
these are like twelve sets of eyelashes
I already gave away one on the blog and
I links you guys to that blog post in a
previous video so congrats to the person
who has received this obviously it's an
advent calendar and today is the 1st of
December so it's just going to be a
24-hour twitter at run a competition so
I'll leave a link to a tweet down below
and all you want to do is retweet it so
it's really really easy but yeah so it's
gonna be 24 hours so 5 p.m. and the 2nd
of December is when it's gonna end and
I'll be posting it first class on the
3rd of December so hopefully so you'll
get it on the 4th and
and then yeah it's like a 12 day event
calendar so you could probably save it
till the twelve and then open it every
day until Christmas Eve whatever you
want to do so let me just show you my
outfit and then I've got a rush out the
door so this is a little dress that I
picked up I picked it out actually
yesterday which was my birthday in
French Oh focus is really weird
so yeah I picked this dress up yesterday
in French Connection and I thought it'd
be a really good one for today because
to be honest I don't really know what
the dress code is and this can be smart
or it can be casual and also the
building that we're going to is quite an
old and it's like a Tudor Lodge so it
could be really cold and I thought this
would be you know it's reasonably warm
I've got thick black tights on my usual
ruslan Bromley Highline boots and then
I'm going to be taking my new over here
so I remember such a tip new Radley
clutch bag which I got from their event
last night and it's actually
personalized with my initials so I
thought I thought that went really
nicely together so I'm gonna head off
now I'll see you guys later on
you
that's where my camera decided to stop
recording if anything when I pressed
record some story from the abrupt and
basically I just went home that day
after a lovely day a great Fosters I
didn't really explain what it was though
so basically mom and I went to an event
called the taste of Christmas and it's
put on by this hotel in Surrey and there
was a cooking demonstration so we
watched the chefs make pancetta
cranberry and chestnut ravioli which we
tried afterwards and oh my gosh it's so
delicious so that was really lovely and
then a company called lilies flowers who
I think are kind of like floral partners
or the great faucets so I'm sure they do
lots of wedding displays that they
showed us how to make a beautiful table
setting for Christmas Day using loads of
things which you can just pick up in
your garden and they were like
spray-painting flowers with metal spray
paint or with glitter so it's really
beautiful and I have done the whole blog
post about that so I'll leave that down
below if you want to get some table
decoration ideas and then we had a
lovely three-course lunch which was my
first turkey lunch of the year so that
was really really nice I did explain all
of this on the afternoon that it
happened but um yeah my camera clearly
just decided not to record any of it so
it's a very short but sweet first day of
vlogging us but I hope you guys have
enjoyed just a little snippet and it
kicks off properly tomorrow tomorrow
it's gonna be the first of December so I
really hope you guys enjoy my daily
vlogs throughout the 1st December and
don't forget to enter the giveaway the
details are all down below just have to
follow me and retweet that message to
win the idea advent calendar which I'll
post as soon as possible

Christmas so see you in the next Pokemon
