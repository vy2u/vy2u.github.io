this is going to be a weekend of
wellness and just healthy lovely
lifestyle and escaping at the city
Charlie and I have come to a place in
the Cotswolds Gloucestershire called
Lakes by you in fact a Roger offer
actually in Gloucestershire either way
we're out of London and that is all that
matters so I thought before we get
started with the healthy activities that
we're doing this weekend I'm gonna give
you a little house tour yes house not
room tour because here at Lakes Bayou
I'll leave the link to place down below
cos trust me okay I want to check this
place out it's basically a load of the
utiful houses by some man-made Lakes and
these houses are just stunning I think
most the houses are actually owned but
you're able to rent them out so without
further ado check out this room we are
very lucky to have a view of lakes
behind us this humongous stunning lounge
area
look at that it's even an egg chair
outside and then the kitchen is just
absolutely housecalls look at this
beautiful wooden island all the kitchen
things in there there's Chas keeping
hydrated and then this beautiful
humungous balcony overlooking the lake
ah I just noticed this is a rabbit doing
a wee look that is very rude he's doing
a wee so this is the view from our
balcony and these are all the houses
they're all kind of like hidden away
there's loads of different Lakes not
just this one all the furniture
hanging chair and so this is upstairs
I'll show you our little bathroom with
found food toiletries it was wonderful
in the bathroom double sinks which is
great because Charlie Knight always
argue in the sink space there's another
bedroom in there sneak peek it's quite
similar to ours this is a twin twin bed
I think we're sharing a house with a
couple of journalists so this is an inch
house room excuse our stuff everywhere
but a beautiful room got this nice
dressing table got some bits and bobs in
here got some super elixir and bees yeah
organics is that how you say it it's
because yes
spiezio organics and again fabulous view
and then the other room on this floor
we're not sure if he's staying in here
but they've definitely lucked out this
is the best room by far they've got a
egg-shaped bath nicely kind of like
slate double sink and then the actual
room itself is amazing
look at this it's humungous and so
bright not gonna lie I've got major
Freeman because I definitely would have
filmed a few videos if we do been put in
this room but never mind
I'm sure it's some editor of Vogue or
something like that staying next door
but yeah how stunning is this bedroom
and then finally if we go up final
flight of stairs we get to the master
bedroom
which is just beautiful let's see who's
staying here don't know who that is
look at this oh my god our room is teeny
compared to this look at this bathroom
wonder what they'd do if we just swapped
so we've now come to the main kind of
villa which is where all of the
activities over we can enjoy happening I
think this one is becoming more
beautiful look at this and this is owned
by a South African families lots of
African inspired art on the walls it's
just absolutely beautiful and again huge
panoramic balcony and I'll just take you
into the kitchen where the
patina is happiness make some
plant-based foods I think we're about to
make on my personal itinerary for this
afternoon I've got well I started off
with a consultation all about kind of
mindfulness everything that I've been
getting into recently which is fabulous
and after speaking to the consultant
about it we've decided that the head in
heaven treatment is going to be best for
me so it's very light massage lots of
like oils in the hair and on the face
they're really looking forward to that
avoiding the eyebrows of course and
we're using a natural 100 cent organic
brand called Viet Xia which is actually
made here in the UK using all natural
and organic ingredients and products
we're gonna be absolutely lovely this is
why I think my treatment it's gonna give
an hour long we are so relaxed we had a
beautiful evening after my massage I was
just feeling in like a daze those days
so relaxing and we went downstairs and
Bettina who I didn't realize I was going
on Instagram for ages for Tina's kitchen
there's nearly a hundred thousand
followers and she prepared us a
based meal so clearly does plant-based
eating which I've never really thought
about doing before because I'm such a
burger lover but she had a the most
delicious dinner that makes me realize I
probably could actually live that kind
of lifestyle so cool st. so dinner was
absolutely delicious quite surprisingly
really surprised how much I enjoyed it
and then we had some meditation so a
really really chilled evening and as you
can see I have the most disgustingly
oily hair and makeup free oily face at
the moment after my massage so I'm dying
in the bath I've just surrounded the
most amazing bars with pamphlet
toiletries which were in the room so
it's gonna be very luxurious but I
thought I would quickly show you this
sounds very dorky but a new direction
that I'm going to be trying over the
weekend because to be honest I don't
actually we're taking every day I'm
pretty lazy and I often forget to put it
on so when I heard about perspex which
lasts up to five days and you don't have
to worry about it you can bath and
shower do crazy exercise or in my cases
we can jump in the legs and yeah it just
lasts for five days so I'm gonna read
the instruction manual because it's not
like no more do you have to like have to
pay attention and yeah you know how I go
so here are my two boxes I've got the
original which is the blue one and the
Comfort which is the green one and come
for I guess is just a little bit better
for sensitive skin but I'm just gonna go
with the original so this has been
really great for festivals or even if
you're going on holiday because it's
clinically proven to completely control
sweat and odor for up to five days which
is just incredibly handy and I thought
it was getting really complicated but
basically all you have to do is put two
strokes on so roll it up and down once
in each underarm and then wash it off
the next morning so you have to make
sure you guys are all keen and drying
use the hairdryer and but you can't have
shaved the day before so I haven't
shaved my arms in a nice so I'm all good
to go I have my nice bath make sure yeah
only start today I can't remember where
I finished my vlog last night I think I
was probably talking about deodorant
update from which I put it on after the
bath just a couple of strokes on each
underarm
after my underarms Authority dried as
for the instructions and then this
morning I just used hot water and soap
to wash it off apparently that's it I
don't need to do anything else now and
I'm going to be sweat and free at least
for the weekend but um yeah it should
last for the next five days
that's amazing perfect for the
activities that we've got coming up so
on the itinerary today we're gonna get
the bike we're gonna bike over to the
main lodge we're gonna meet the rest of
the gang and we're going to do some
sunrise yoga although I'm pretty sure
the sun's already up so just lovely
morning yoga overlooking the lake and
then we have a PT session so this is
whatever deodorant will really get put
through its test we've got an intense PT
session with a room of his name but he's
like a really famous personal trainer
and then to follow that we have a physio
session with a physio who does the
physio for Team GB so I expect good
things from him I might see if he's
allowed the aches and pains in my
shoulders so it's gonna be a busy day
without further ado
so we come to the main lodge and we're
starting the day with a super elixir
which is the element Kirsten McPherson
fearsome Alec first and
I think it's like a superfood specimens
juiced with blended apple and just
enjoying it well
because
because
a couple of hours later now and Charlie
and I have just spent the past like 45
minutes in our beautiful little house
taking some photos our life would just
be so much easier if our house is this
photogenic because isn't every surface
like perfect for blogs photos look you
still at it yeah yeah every single
photos we got Marvel you've got dark
wizards textures negative not here
there's nothing perfect actually I hunt
seen many dogs around here be
interesting to never they do allow dogs
but yeah so we've spent the past 45
minutes we had a little bit of free time
while everyone is getting one-on-one
physio sessions we are the last two so
we've taken the time to do some photos
but before that so we had a banner our
long chat as a group with a physio from
the Bosworth clinic and he is he was
amazing wasn't he so he basically has
Gordon Bosworth so he is the physio for
Team GB and he was just telling us stuff
that you kind of should already know but
people just don't do like the importance
of posture and eppadi it's a legal
requirement for your workplace to get a
test conducted on where you sit at work
so that's really interesting obviously I
am self-employed so I need to just
figure it out myself but very very
interesting and he was just showing us
how much better you feel if you walk
properly if you stand properly and all
that jazz that was really really
interesting
I think Chaz Knight I think we probably
got about an hour left of free time now
so probably gonna take a little bike and
explore the Lake area because there is a
main hub somewhere and yeah we just want
to check it out a little bit more it's
actually roasting today in this house in
particular it's really really warm and
then we've got the PT session later so
we're putting my deodorant to the test
to make sure I'm not smelly later on and
but yeah it's gonna be a fun afternoon
got lunch cooked by betina's kitchen
again so fun that healthy and very
active day ahead it's time for lunch in
the tepee
it has been a rather active afternoon so
I'll fill you in on when I last vlogs we
had lunch took five attina which was
amazing incredibly healthy and yet I
actually liked it so that was rather
spectacular and then we had a little bit
of chill time China I went for a bike
ride
which is really nice to have a little
look around the whole Lakes Bayou area
so we looked out loads of the homes the
homes here absolutely mental it's such a
nice community you can imagine like all
the children growing up here it's kind
of like The Truman Show Evan keeps
saying it's just so perfect here so it's
really lovely to have a little look
around by bicycles we found some
chickens we yeah just enjoyed the views
of the lakes by bicycle so that was a
really nice way to look around and
explore the Lakes area and all the homes
woodland homes and lakeside homes and
then we went back to the teepee area and
I had my very first physio session with
Gordon and Bosworth and Gordon is the
physio for a lot of the Olympic athletes
and is basically the best physio in the
UK and yes it's my first video session
generally know what to expect and to be
honest I didn't think much would happen
because I never thought anything was
wrong with my body aside from the odd
ache and pain but apparently my pelvis
was completely locked and that's why
sometimes my shoulders ache that's why
sometimes I get shin splints all because
of my locked pelvis so Gordon kind of
wrenched each leg down and I could feel
like popping back into the place that it
should be and then he asked me to walk
down the corridor and it was amazing how
much difference I noticed just so much
lighter yeah really incredible and then
he did some stretches on my head I could
hear my head clicking I could hear my
shoulders clicking so I feel a lot more
light and free now and so much more
flexible I did try to like touch my toes
before and afterwards and now I can
actually touch my toes which is amazing
so that was really fab and then after
that we had an intense hour-long PT
session which I think I filmed some
clips of and it was all using the
elastic I don't know what they're called
the elastic things that you kind of like
lean on
and so different kind of exercise to
anything I've ever done before but it
was hot and sweaty so ya need to freshen
up before dinner but thanks to my
perspex I am lovely and odor free to be
honest it's funny actually because with
my old deodorants that I used to use I
would just smell of like you know
whatever the perfume of the deodorant is
but I actually don't spend at all which
is actually even better so if you want
to put on your nice perfume your Joe
Malone or whatever it's not going to mix
in with your deodorant smell which is
wonderful so I'm going to go back inside
the main house now and patina has
prepared us a raw afternoon tea so it's
safe to say I'm very intrigued and
hungry hopefully it's gonna be tasty
woman
patina can you toss in the cake an hour
and a half later and I've just quickly
got showered and changed
I'll show you quick outfit Damon second
and shiny and I are now back at the main
house and the Tina is going to cook us
all dinner with us tonight so it's
really more of an interactive session
and we're going to making a rule we'll
find out in a second we probably get
started I just found the perfect mirror
to show you I have it up tonight I'm
pretty sure you've seen all of these
bits and bobs before but I have got some
new sunglasses these are Valentino and
then top is from Topshop jeans with a
little detail on the knees from
supertrash and then my bag are showing
my bag is from satchels and I'm slightly
obsessed about
good morning it is our third third and
final day in the Cotswolds today and we
woke up bright and early and did loads
of blog photos place is just so
photogenic had to get lots of work done
so did lots of photos this morning and
now we've made our way over to the main
house and you can see behind me in the
kitchen Bettina and Jay are busy
rustling up an incredibly healthy
breakfast
we've got raw vegan gluten-free pancakes
which look beautiful and a super nexus
smoothie as well let me show you how
gorgeous they are
jay is also ripping up a what is it a
healthy hot chocolate healthy hot
chocolate look at this making them all
perfect and then over here
Bettina has made the most incredible
pancakes Wow and here are was really
best way to start the day
so here's my breakfast I've got the
pancakes
maybe pistachio coconut yogurt and
almond milk or chocolate with coconut
sugar and an incredibly healthy green
juice made with the cereal
in fact that's amazing and he probably
could tell by my video clips yeah just
so nice having healthy food prepared for
you I would definitely eat more
healthily at home if I could just have
someone to prepare it for me but that's
benefit of coming here yeah I'm just
taking a moment to step outside enjoy
the peace and tranquility of the lakes
because once I get back to London it's
not for now it's just taken these
beautiful views
we're at we're going down once they
ditch the bikes for a few minutes and
we're exploring by foot this behind me
is like a massive woodshed and a fire
pit and it's where Ben Fogle does his
pool of wild so all the kids that come
here like kind of summer camp they can
learn about how to make things in the
wild like I don't know all kinds of
skills that proper men and women need to
survive
the bikes have been ditched and we are
now on a rowing boat it's very very
Nicholas Sparks so we reached the final
stop on our bike tour and this house was
designed by none other
though suddenly the time has come when
we are leaving the lakes had a wonderful
relaxing weekend away from the city
we've done yoga done healthy eating bike
rides boat trips I was very meditation
everything you need her maxing weekends
that's been really wonderful was when
your highlight on him food every years
of my life opportunity miss kitchen she
was amazing it's just an all vegan food
or weekend I didn't think not just being
in a department we can go back to London
but hopefully we're going to keep up our
new healthy ways don't forget to do more
meditation and healthy eating but how to
say I'm looking forward to a little bit
each reason re but thank you guys so
much for watching and thank you to leave
