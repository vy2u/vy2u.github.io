a what I eat in a day Charlie nice
finished our workout at virgin and we're
now going to have a nice breakfast out
it's Sunday morning and and we probably
have a breakfast out every other Sunday
with play-doh yeah it's sort of offering
nozzle yeah
so sometimes we make breakfast at home
but after a workout we often feel like
we just want to treat ourselves so we're
going to go to the restaurant and in
custom old town and have I'm probably
gonna have pancakes because why not and
then we're going to head back home and
I'll just show you what what you think
throughout the day so as you saw this
morning already had my cup of English
breakfast tea
and my yogurt pretty much what I have
every single morning so how many yogurts
we normally house quite a few these busy
week so my favorite thing
okay few hours later now in fact it's
about five hours later it's dark outside
feel like the last time I spoke to you
at breakfast but we did have a really
big breakfast I think by the time we
left there was just after 1:00 so
definitely more of a brunch definitely
the best cappuccino in London I would
say that place so so good if you live
South West London and definitely check
that out and as you saw I had pancakes
with maple syrup extra maple syrup which
I spilt on the table bacon Charlie had
more of a a better postion breakfast he
had scrambled eggs salmon spinach so he
is very healthy yeah so I'm not really
not eating anything for the rest of the
afternoon because the breakfast kind of
fills me up and I've just been unboxing
some blogger mail you might have seen it
over on my Instagram stories but this is
one thing where I do always eat naughty
things because the Browns often send
lots of yummy treats alongside the gifts
so I'm just going to show you a few of
the bits and bobs food wise that I was
sent today we've got these cookies which
were from Honeywell bakery and they were
sent by Sienna ex Charlie's already has
a nibble of one car neck sent you some
love hearts to celebrate their love
heart flavored soap and then these the
sentence with Carmex as opposed to
carrot for their kids kids are ensign
fishin this is a chocolate cake which
again Charlie's had a nibble out so I'm
not sure who sent in that and then dar
fans and over some pure ma macaroons
which look amazing in fact going to have
a nibble of one now oh so good so yeah
not a terribly exciting day food ride so
far but let me show you a couple of
Charlie knives favorite recipe books so
you guys have heard me talking about
Madeleine Shores books before I'm still
actually obsessed with them love making
the bits and bobs and Canada's really
healthy recipes we often make
life-changing tomato soup Lee halloumi
and kosher frittatas or fritters so many
nice recipes in there so
if you follow me again on Instagram
you'll see me making lots of those but
for this evening we've got our hello
fresh delivery coming which the things
are life so much easier we just pick a
recipe that we want to cook and they
deliver the exact amounts of ingredients
because one thing that I do find with
the recipes in my book is firstly
Chalian I didn't have a car we live in
London and we don't have a car so
especially during Rugby season when
Charlie is often feeling a little bit
battered and bruised and can't carry so
much home from supermarkets it's not
easy for us to carry tons and comes back
so delivery services like hello fresh
whispers good for us and also with
especially the more healthy recipes like
in the books you often have to buy loads
of a certain ingredient whereas maybe
just need a pinch of ginger or just a
tiny bit of something so hellofresh
delivers the exact right amount so that
should be coming puts in about half an
hour so when it does I will unbox it
show you what we've got and get cooking
with you the world charlie is watching
the rugby I thought I would share with
you a couple more of the books that I'm
really enjoying at the moment and
they're kind of recipe books but more
based around beauty and lifestyle so you
may have spotted on a recent unboxing I
got the goop clean Beauty so this is one
of Paltrow's books although it's written
by the editors group and just forward by
Gwyneth Paltrow so this one's really
good if you're into health but more kind
of mindful into the skin and nutrient as
opposed to hardcore fitness it says the
ultimate guide to healthy body and
natural glow and a happy mindful life so
whatever you like about this is it's not
just a recipe book it's got recipes
showing things that are really good for
the skin like I mean a lot of salad some
that I'm not going to lie a little bit
too healthy for my liking but it's also
got lots of information on fisherman's
and it's got some exercises which gets
the body pumping and everything moving
again all relating back to the skin and
to the general health of the body so
that's a really good when I'm in
clicking through that quite recently and
then another one we could say I prefer
actually is this it is skin by and Liz
oh this one has got low denies dresses
in it but
so it tells you about how to really
detox the whole body to again helps of
skin so she go through this huge long
process beginning I think it's like at
six weeks detox six weeks detox program
I got a contract six week detox program
all about how to change up your skin
care your diet where you drink will you
eat etcetera for the long-term benefit
of your skin and one of my favorite
things in this book is her beauty bombs
recipe so I think I showed in a recent
vlog my healthy kind of beauty bar
recipe and I've actually switched that
up a little bit based on a few
ingredients in little beauty balm so I
might make some of those really quickly
now I'd love to do this on a Sunday
because I find you in the week I just
don't really want to spend the time
making healthy snacks because they can
be a little bit time-consuming these
take maybe a grand total of 20 minutes
leave them in the fridge and they last
for like two weeks so let's get cooking
so I'm going to make a variation of the
Mizell beauty bombs so inside this
there's loads and loads of different
seeds pumpkin seeds sunflower seeds
sesame cherries cranberries even a
little bit of orange juice so I'm going
to mix that in with the ingredients for
my beauty bars and stick it on the
Thermomix
and we're good to go alright so here are
my ingredients the main thing that you
need for these is dates I just get dates
from Spain freeze or Tesco I've actually
got both you need to basically take the
spoons out of these and then stick them
in your blender I get quite a lot of
questions about this this is a Thermomix
it's basically a super duper snazzy
blender it can make food pick and make
ice cream it's just incredible and then
you can put loads of recipes on the
screen as well so good and then to be
honest you can really mix and match the
little recipe includes some dried
cranberries and raisins etc so I've just
got this little mixed bag he's nice by
the way it's my washing machine going
off and then you can put in loads of
different types of seeds and nuts such
as walnuts I've got some goji berries
and then also some superfood as well so
this is what's going to make it a little
bit more chocolatey but in a healthy
ways my cacao infusion I've got this
and listen I'll leave that link down
below and any other powders you want
stick in I've got some baobab and then
you guys know how much I love the good
guru these are just little sachets with
seeds and fiber in there so I'm going to
put all these ingredients as well as
some additional feed
so let's you always got I usually have a
few in here we've got some sunflower
seeds
that's a sweet mix I'll be good one
flower seeds and pumpkin seeds so all of
these seeds mixed with this should be a
really good dose of omega-3 protein and
fiber to keep me going when I get
peckish so now all you have to do is
stick em all in there blend it up and
that's you'll mix it up
I
you
okay so well that was in the blender
this what the rise our dinner for the
week it's our hello fresh breath box so
Charlie's going to unbox that while I
finish off showing you what to do with
the beauty bars
beauty balls so muddling Shaw and Liz
Earle actually recommend just putting
them in ball shapes but personally I
find out a little bit too much effort so
I'm going to put mine into bars so what
I like to do is lay out the mixture and
you can see here looking very delightful
into a baking tray and the consistency
are looking for is quite squidgy I mean
this only feels wet and you need to
squidgy says it's moldable and says it
doesn't have crumble all in your hands
if it's not quite switch enough just add
in a little bit more coconut oil to keep
on adding more coconut oil until your
mixture is just a really soft and
squidgy consistency technical terms I
know and another thing that I love about
this recipe is you can literally just
stick in or as you've got your covers
every single time I make this it's
completely different but it tastes
amazing so I'm going to Pat this down
and then stick it in the fridge
okay so now it's time for us to open up
our dinner this is our hello fresh
rescue box so the box itself is
refrigerated so even if you miss your
delivery it will still say nice and
fresh all the ingredients inside
so once Charlie's finished reading
Dexter going to unbox it and get cooking
alrighty so I've done a little bit of
unboxing here are some of our
ingredients for tonight and a few extras
for the rest of the week as well I've
got a few of some other evenings recipe
bits still in the bags
but tonight Charlie and I are going to
be making our Thai massaman rice with
chicken and chestnut mushrooms when you
open up your box you also have the
recipe cards and you've already chosen
the recipe that you want online so chai
and I have gone for three this week
we're going to go for our curry tonight
this is really good because not only
does it tell you step-by-step
instructions of how to make it but it's
also got the exact ingredients and
everything has been measured out so this
is the exact amount of rice you need for
two people the exact amount of chickens
is not going to be any wastage and it's
also really good because you don't have
to have too much lying around in your
cupboard so cornflour I'm not sure when
else I would use that and I'm pretty
sure you can't normally get it in less
than like five times this quantities
that's really handy so yeah this tells
me that it's going to take 30 minutes
why am i five a day it's going to be
super spicy and it's also got some
information about the dish about the
chef and then some interesting facts as
well and then really clear step-by-step
instructions as well as pictures and
also nutritional information so you've
got the energy the calories per serving
per hundred grams the fat that saturated
fat carbs sugars etc so this just makes
it super obvious how much better for you
this is down any takeaways any
ready-made meals which Charlie and I
which went to be healthy so it's much
better for us than those kind of things
and yeah we haven't actually had to take
away in
weeks and we haven't had a ready meal
and God knows how long so we're doing
well doing well but yeah so these are
the ingredients for today got a couple
of the next few days ingredients we've
only gone for three recipes in this
order because it's fashion week and I'm
going to be out quite a few evenings so
we didn't need dinner every single night
so I flipped this round thing as I'm
talking to you but yeah that's one
reason why we love Hado first because
you can just choose how many meals you
want you can choose how many people so
if next week for example my mum was
staying with us liking us so
unflattering on my nose if next week my
mum was staying with us we could just
add on another person we could change
the delivery dates we could change the
time and if you are going away or going
trouble you can actually put poles on
your deliveries too so I think it's up
to 12 weeks you can pause your
deliveries they're really really good
service I think if you're single if you
live by yourself it's amazing because
you don't have to buy in those
additional ingredients a lot of these
meals I think when you're cooking for
one person it's quite hard to get the
quantities right
your friend zone ends up giving yourself
such a healthy meal because you don't
want to waste any ingredients but also
if you're just super busy like for chai
and I we just don't have time to spend
ages going up and back supermarket
aisles and as I said earlier we don't
have a car so for that ought to be
delivered right to our door in a
refrigerated box is super duper handy so
I think Koster 7 it's about time we got
cooking
okay so I've reached the final step on
my recipe card I've got the chicken
simmering up and leave it simmer for ten
minutes
gently and then I'm going to start
preparing and getting it all in the dish
ready to eat they are thinking about
cooking us another really good thing for
chai and I is portion control because
Charlie always has eyes bigger than his
coming so he always ends up cooking
fasting much whereas that we couldn't
know that we've got the perfect amount a
few people I probably eat a little bit
less than the average person and Charlie
probably a little bit more so always
balance about and but here we've got the
perfect amount for both of us so it is
smelling so good when I added that
peanut butter it just starting to smell
so amazing better than the curry from
across the road have to say so many time
to serve up and then time to enjoy
you're excited to try it
okay so after the all important in the
story photos prove to the world that I
don't only eat macaroni cheese it's time
to dig in okay so as it is Sunday
evening Shaz nine using that as an
excuse to have a dinner in front of the
TV or watching Dragons Den at Choi's
already dug in how is it going
yeah it's really good Jack good work
good work from Jesse from me yes we said
Charlie nearly always does the cooking
part from when it's mac and cheese and
it's my turn so let's see how it takes
all gone and that was absolutely
scrumptious I've never actually made a
curry before with corn flour in there
but it just added a little something
extra to the chicken and that curry
paste was the delicious even China
doctor as well he doesn't really like
things are too spicy but it was just
absolutely lovely
so thank you tell her fresh for
introducing us to a new recipe I think
I'm gonna do now is to have just a
nighttime calming tea I don't have a
cappuccino up maybe one o'clock today so
that's still making me feel a little bit
energetic I need to have something a
little bit more calming and China I've
been using the Elle McPherson super a
next year
sleep well fortified calming tea
recently and that's really really nice
and I have that with my CNX cookies that
I have from earlier so a very successful
Sunday dinner and we've got our other
two recipes for tomorrow night and think
Thursday night other nights that we're
cooking from home cause I'm getting bit
shiny new tailor-make sauce so we're
pretty much all sorted for our food for
the week which is amazing and we've not
had to do our supermarket shop I leave
more information about hellofresh down
below they have a special offer on which
is 25 pounds off your first box which
just makes it so so affordable
especially four weeks worth of food or
however many recipes you get so all the
info will be down below for now I'm
going to head back
who's that so forget my cup of tea and
enjoy my relaxing Sunday evening all
right folks
it is half past 9:00 which means this to
my bedside we're going to be up super
early tomorrow to do some work before I
head out for a nine o'clock breakfast
meeting so yeah I'm gonna head fed I've
done my usual thing when I make a cup of
tea and there's only half drunk it's I'm
just going to fill this up again
what okay I'll fill it up to the top
again and take that upset with me I'm
not actually going to eat anything else
normally I would have maybe a cookie to
do or another one of my banana and
chocolate yogurt but normally take my
mother's bed but I'm so full that curry
has really kept me full so yeah that's
everything that I have eaten today and
