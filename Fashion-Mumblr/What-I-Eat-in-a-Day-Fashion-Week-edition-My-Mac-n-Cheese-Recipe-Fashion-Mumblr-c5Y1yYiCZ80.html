ever wat by eat in a day video hope you
request to do one of these videos and I
thought today the quite a fun day to do
my first one it's actually the last day
of London Fashion Week today but I'm not
actually going 20 shows I'm just going
to a few events and I've got quite a few
meetings today so it's pretty much like
a normal lager everyday routine if that
makes sense plus a few little extra
things and from the apartment which you
guys will see later on so I started off
this morning I didn't want to vlog
because my face was a little bit just
got out of bed so I started off by
having a big glass of water when I came
downstairs I usually drink the glass
while I'm waiting for the kettle to boil
and then make myself a nice cup of
English breakfast tea builders brew with
milk and two sugars and then usually
what I'll do is have a molar crunch
corner I love at the banana and chakra
flakes flavour I tend to have at least
one of those every day for breakfast
they'll probably have ones another one
later on in the day they are definitely
my guilty pleasure if I do any more
these videos will definitely be seeing a
lot more of those so I'm heading out now
I've got a breakfast meeting I have
breakfast meetings maybe two or three
times a week just with pr's or with
brands that I'm working with
so quite a normal start to the day so
let's go and get some breakfast
so come to the may deli for breakfast
and I'm just having a look at all the
healthy options I'm not very good at
healthy food so pretty much that I will
explain to me but Cheers
so I have gone for their pancakes which
has buckwheat vanilla powder and a lot
of other ingredients I can't remember
but all very healthy with spiced apple
compote and I think this is coconut yep
yeah looks good
I just come out with my breakfast
meeting at the movie deli which is
really lovely I had super healthy
pancakes I had to side avocado and I've
just got this smoothie for from the go I
think it's like carrot apple celery kale
there's loads and loads of really
healthy ingredients which is nice and
suddenly today is going to get a little
bit unhealthy and I'm heading to the
apartment where there's basically
endless amounts of sweets and doughnuts
so no doubt I won't be tempted by that
but yeah I'm gonna head into a few shops
on my way there don't have any more
meetings for a couple of hours
baby
I'm at the apartment now and we ordered
lunch on the table each easy and they've
put in a load of pizzas from Pizza
pilgrimage so a slice of pecan mix area
around myself you sweetie
I'm back home now after an afternoon in
the apartments I did actually just
arrived home to really exciting delivery
from Farrar O'Shea I just snapchat it
when it looked like it was basically
like a picnic hamper filled with flowers
and chocolates most of which I've just
got here I'm going to really go to not
having chocolates Charley's just made us
both a green tea so I'm going to have
some tea and I'm pretty gonna dig into
that little bag of sweets that I put
together at the apartment
the outfit change of the day this cuz
I'm about to head up to the
hairdresser's to get my hair color toned
back to being a little bit more of an
ashy color um and I was obviously very
casual before but I need to go into
Sainsbury's look Charlie's moved by
macaroni cheese cookbook I think he's
trying to tell me something there it is
um yes I need to pop into Sainsbury's on
my way home from the hairdresser and I'm
going to make a macaroni cheap tonight
my absolute favorite I have got a tried
and tested recipe which is like my
classic recipe which I swear is the best
lycra new cheese in the whole world and
and if you have actually message me
being like can you share your recipe
because I think I like snapchat it loads
and obviously it looks really good so
I'm going to do my classic recipe
tonight but I'm just gonna have a flick
through the anime mac and cheese book
just to see if I can get any inspiration
on how to make it a little bit more
unusual
so I normally just use parmesan and
cheddar but in the book they recommend a
few different types like Monterey Jack
brie mozzarella
Havarti I don't actually know what that
one is ooh yeah is amazing if you want
it to be really like stringy which is
delicious so Alan parmesan so I think I
might just have a little look in
Sainsbury's to see if there's any cheese
on special offer this just makes me so
and this one also recommends mustard in
it as well so I think I might add a bit
of mustard I've done that before and
it's been delicious oh my god my mouth
right now I cannot stop dribbling oh so
tasty right I'm gonna head off so I can
make my mac and cheese
although I had done it was as weird red
can steam treatment which is good for
hair that's been colored or like dry and
so yeah has really nicely muddy and soft
now and now I'm home which is time cook
my teeth so keep on watching if you want
to see how I do my legendary you must
thank you so the first thing I do is
cook the pasta or at least get it
started so I've got the kettle boiling
I'm gonna see which pasta we're going to
use
going to go to some rigatoni which is my
favorite from my career new cheese I'm
going to put some salt in my ready point
in kettles boiled right a lot and I've
gathered my cheese's so this is pilgrims
choice and short cheddar I'm just going
to use up that last bit there's not very
much in there and then I'm going to top
up with Cathedral City image or cheddar
got some parmesan in here that we kick
it off the other day and then I've got
some red Leicester to sprinkle on top
also going to need some milk and some
butter to put in the pan and then we've
got just some plain flowers so we're
going to start with the pasta I find
that rigatoni because it's a bit thicker
it takes a bit longer to cook so I
always get this cooking before I start
anything else I do like it a bit I'll
don't do this I won't pick it all the
way through maybe like eight minutes
feeling quite hungry today so I put like
four handfuls might go for one more just
fill up there we go
we have an audience member and next I'm
going to start grating all of my
cheese's okay so I finished creating my
cheese's on for a selection of cheddar
parmesan and that's what I bought I've
got them all in their separate pile that
any large of its I will stick into the
sauce as well as create a bit so that
they melt down and then I'll save a
little bit of parmesan and red left it's
sprinkle on the top so gonna keep
staring the past area make sure that's
cooking
even me and now let's start on the
cheese for you scavenging for any bits
of cheese that mummies dropped piggy
piggy so the cheese sauce I'm taking a
nonstick pan this is pretty much my
macaroni cheese pan always use the same
one and then I'm going to take butter
blur pack already salted is my usual
and I'm going to put one kind of
teaspoon it's been tablespoon into my
pan about that much looks like quite a
lot and then I'm going to set that off
I'm quite a low temperature so that it
starts to melt and as soon as that's all
liquid I'm gonna start adding in a few
spoonfuls of plain flour just slowly 1/2
that looks like that enough and I'm
gonna use a wooden spoons just stir that
all in together into a nice paste and
then before that has any chance to get
burnt we're going to add in a little bit
of milk let's stir that all up and then
as soon as that's all stirred in keep on
adding the milk so the sauce thickens up
as it heats up and when you get to a
paste just every time adding a bit more
milk and stirring and then when it gets
too thick to stir you just add more milk
ok now I'm going to turn my oven on
mine's pretty hick quick to heat up so
you might need to be yours on earlier
and I think I'm gonna do about 250 well
213 maybe that's as hot as it goes there
we go
I've been teaching and back in my
thoughts
I'm just gonna test my pesticide on't
want it to overcook okay my past is done
so I'm gonna drain this off into a sieve
and then I'm literally just gonna leave
that there while I carry on or if
mussels okay so this is the current
consistency of my cheese sauce I'm gonna
stop adding milk now and then just leave
it continually stirring it on the heat
for maybe about a minute I can see it
bubbling until it just sickens up a tiny
bit and then it's time to add the cheese
so I'm lowering the temperature so that
it's hardly bubbling and then I'm going
to start adding in a handful by handful
of cheese starting with any solid bits
mixture of cheddar and red last oh there
we go
stirring it all in these if in doubt
just go with more cheese more the
merrier cheese is melting nicely and I'm
gonna add in kind of half a teaspoon of
mustard just to give it a bit of a kick
don't always do this but fancy something
a little bit different tonight stirring
that all in and then I'm going to pop in
some black and pepper as well so I've
put in quite a bit of black pepper
stirring that in with the mustard and
that's pretty much it for the cheese
sauce if you want to test it to see if
you want to put in some more cheese or
some more pepper just grab a bit of your
pasta give it a bit of a taste
that is absolutely amazing so I'm going
to get my macaroni cheese dish out I
have like a specific one and I always
use use by the crews a so what I'm going
to do is stick my pasta into the dish
make sure it's all rinsed out so I've
covered the pasta in the cheese sauce
and put a load of pepper on top and then
the last thing I'm gonna do is take a
few more handfuls of my cheese quite a
big one
and give it a good old sprinkling I'm
just gonna cover the top so it goes nice
and crispy and then I'm gonna put this
see you in ten minutes my friend okay
ten minutes later now so I'm gonna have
a little look see how it's looking that
looks pretty good to me so there we have
it boys and girls my absolutely perfect
looking macaroni cheese cooked to
perfection I'm gonna put a little bit
more pepper on it before I dig in oh
look at that oh my god I'm so excited my
mouth because I have to say as I have
ever made so I'm glad I caught it on
video for you guys hopefully you enjoyed
the little recipe it's definitely not
the healthiest of days it's gone from
being quite healthy in the morning to
reversibly worse and worse as the day
goes on I can't actually talk because my
mouth is watering so much so let's dig
in
hmm I think the mustard is what has
absolutely took this over the edge I
didn't put too much in but it's got a
little bit of kick to it which just
makes it incredible sometimes I would
put bread crumbs on the top nothing very
crispy and but only if I've got like the
stale ish end of a baguette sometimes
I'll put bacon in which is also amazing
but yeah this is pretty close to my best
mac and cheese ever so Charlie's just
come in with his dinner which it's
putting mine to shame because he's being
very very healthy this evening let me
show you what he's having
Blizzard darling sorry it's brown rice
and quinoa with feta cheese broccoli
asparagus and cheese steak with this
really nice very healthy I mean while my
mustard mac and cheese is going down
absolute treat so I officially feel like
I'm in a food coma after demolishing my
macaroni cheese ate every single last
drop but now I'm gonna have a bit of
Ribena
I let that settle before I go in for
some pudding and it's now time for bed I
resisted the urge to have any pudding
because I'm still quite cool for my
macaroni cheese but before I go to bed
I'm going to have a refreshes bar which
I went out to get at like 11 o'clock
last night and a sweet tooth
so I need have this now enjoyed washing
my very first water I eat in the day I
promise I'm not always as unhealthy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
