a fabulous Christmas it feels weird not
having spoken to you in quite some time
I definitely got into the swing of daily
vlogging this year I hope you guys
really enjoyed vlogmas but I have to
admit I kind of miss it I feel like I
miss talking to you so it feels good to
be back in front of the camera you may
be able to hear from my voice I've got a
little bit of a cold I seem to have
picked up something over the Christmas
period maybe too much
naughty food and drinks so please
forgive my silly voice but today I
wanted to share with you what I got for
Christmas I've never filmed one of these
videos before but a lot of you guys
asked me to do it on my blog most so
here I am
I also absolutely love watching these
videos and in fact they're probably some
of my favorites to watch and I think
probably the first youtube video that I
watched was a what I got for Christmas
videos so really excited to be filming
my first one today for me Christmas is
really not about receiving gifts it's
more about spending time with those that
I love my friends and my family and
that's exactly what I did this year and
also both Charlie and I and I'm sure a
lot of you guys as well it's so much
more fun to give them is to receive I
definitely love the whole process of
going Christmas shopping and choosing
the right gifts for people but of course
having said that I'm so so so grateful
for all the fabulous pieces that I was
bought this year for Christmas
so I thought I would share them with you
today I'm not going to do these in any
particular order because they all are
just scattered all over the bed and but
yeah let's just go for it so kind of my
main present from my mum was the Dyson
supersonic hair dryer now I was using
one of these in the summer and I was
actually lent one by Dyson to test it
out but I didn't get to keep it sadly
and boy did I miss it when I had to go
back to my old hair dryer so I had a
Dyson supersonic on my wish list for
quite some time I get so many questions
and when I write about it saying do you
think it's worth it and I really do I
absolutely love the Dyson hairdryer so
this was my main present when I was
trying it over the summer I got the grim
pink one but I thought the white and
gray was a little bit more chic
so I'm yet to open this up but I will
open it after the video and I'll insert
an overlay photo or video of it here as
you can see what it looks like I'm
really excited to start using this again
makes my hair drying so much quicker and
I feel like my hair's healthier and
softer when I use this so really excited
to have this as part of my hair routine
again so thank you mama also from my mum
she absolutely spoiled me this year is a
burberry scarf now I don't think I've
ever received anything quite so
luxurious for Christmas before so this
was really really a special treat the
packaging that it comes in itself is
just absolutely beautiful
and as it's my first burberry scarf I
went for a really classic design which
you can see here and she ordered it from
Selfridges calm and the one annoying
thing is that somewhere in here the
security tag is still attached yeah
there we go so I'm going to be having a
slightly angry phone call with
Selfridges later because it means I
can't wear it but this is the scarf I
think there's a cashmere blend yeah 100%
cashmere and it's the classic Burberry
knit with this beautiful heart pattern
on it so just something a little bit
different to the usual Burberry pattern
but still very very classic and I really
think that something like this just
helps to elevate a winter outfit and as
the colors are neutral I feel that they
all go with all of my winter coats
especially my camel Jaeger colored coat
and yoga colored or my camel colored
coat from Jaeger my maroon plum colored
one from Rhys both of which I believe
actually in the sale at the moment so if
you like them then don't hang around
because yeah they're really good priced
at the moment but yes I think this will
just looks so fabulous and really add a
touch of elegance to all of my winter
outfits so absolutely love this those
are probably the two gifts that I'm most
excited about so definitely started with
the best mama also got me this
ultralight down jacket or actually AG
lay a probably uniqlo so I already have
the gold long-sleeve version of this
which also mum bought me and I wear it
so much it's not the most fashionable of
pieces but boy is it warm it's so
practical I hate being cold and also
they scrunch up into absolutely nothing
don't know if this one comes with the
carry case yeah I think it does so this
is going to suck into absolutely nothing
you can keep it in your handbag and it's
just so fabulous for traveling when it's
in the bag you can use as a pillow but
also if you're going to a warm country
and it turns out to be a little bit
cooler in the evenings or just for
traveling and putting on when you get
back in the UK these jackets are so
useful
I think the juillet version will be
great for just going out and walking the
dogs or just putting on underneath the
coat just to have a really lovely warm
layer and I just love this color it's a
beautiful pearly white so really
grateful for this and I will definitely
be getting a lot of use out of that I'm
really sorry about my voice by the way I
have to keep stopping and having a slope
of my lemsip because oh my gosh I didn't
have talked as much over the Christmas
period and it's definitely showing in my
voice so Charlie Dexter and I do
stockings at Christmas we don't like to
go too crazy for each other because we
prefer to put our pennies into something
for the house or something that we're
both going to get some use out of so
Charlie Nye this year agreed that we're
going to be buying a drone between us
and if any of you guys have got any
drone experience any recommendations and
please let me know so we decided to set
a budget for each other's Christmas
stockings this year we picked up three
of these stockings which I'm actually on
the lookout for some iron-on transfers
we can write our names on them so we
have one for me one for Dexter and for
Charlie and we just put a maximum budget
so neither of us went too crazy and
bought some little meaningful bits and
bobs for each other so these are the
bits that Charlie picked up for me first
of all this is becoming a little bit of
a tradition is a long-haired ducks in
2017 calendar so I have to say none of
these dogs are anywhere near as good
looking as Dexter I mean obviously I'm
biased but they're beautiful but they're
just not as handsome as my little chaps
so I think we need to get Dexter into
some modelling because yeah speaking of
which and if you guys don't follow
texture on Instagram then are leaders in
scrambling on the screen there because
well need i say anymore
oh and funnily enough Charlie's mum also
bought me a dachshund diary and or
dachshund calendar so wants to get all
these puppies
Oh II didn't realize these are puppies
okay that is absolutely adorable so I
will be using this in my office and then
the big one will go in the kitchen
downstairs
ciao okay so as you guys may know I am a
big lover of macaroni cheese although I
have to say I think my recipe is the
best in the world but Charlie picked up
a craft macaroni cheese and I think this
is like it sounds like you just add
water type things I'm intrigued try this
if I'm feeling very lazy then perhaps
will be exactly what the doctor ordered
in fact feeling the way I do now I might
actually have this for lunch but we
always buy to the kind of thoughtful
jerky present so that's one of those oh
I have one of Dexter's stocking fillers
in here as well he's got some like
Parmesan I don't know polymer haplotypes
ticks every year Charlie gets me a
chocolate orange I've already started
digging into this one and but yeah
that's in there too and he bought me
some teeth and lips buys things breathe
so these are probably my favorite sweets
it always fills my stocking with sweet
treats and he put in a few bags of these
there should be an open back in here
somewhere hopefully which I will it dig
into something useful you picked me up a
hair turban from soap and glory because
my current one is broken
I broke the elastic on it and then also
a lint gold reindeer I mean it's the
bunny but it just has reindeer horns so
that makes it nice and festive he also
bought me this gold sparkly pouch and I
was a little bit confused when I first
opened it but he said it's because I
always have like memory cards and
adapters and lenses floating around in
the bottom of my handbag so I'm to use
this for my camera bits and bobs which
is really sweet and thoughtful and it's
gold sparkly so I definitely won't be
losing that so a good one to keep all of
my tech bits and bobs safe and sound
what else also on the tech side of
things he bought me some pink phone
wires I mean these sound really boring
but actually they're really thoughtful
and things that I will really really use
so he's done really well this is a set
of two and they're kind of um you know
when they what's the word strengthen the
cables when they've got that really
strong wire around the
so I won't be breaking any more iPhone
cables that's really handy oh and he
also bought me this which I've already
started using in say 2017 diary by
kekeke a and it's this beautiful pinky
gold color and and I just don't really
have much luck when it comes to
technology so my phone diary is often
letting me down so I'm going to be going
back to the old school this year there
is something incredibly satisfying about
using a pen and writing in a paper diary
so I've started putting in my January
appointments in already and I will be
using this as my basically life
organizer for 2017 and also there is a
section at the beginning of each month
where you can see the whole month in
full like so so I think I'm going to use
this as video planning so I can see
which videos I'm going to publish and
plot them out over the month so this is
going to be basically my go-to notebook
diary planner etc I can't remember if
these were from Charlie or from my mum
oh god that's really bad I mean start
writing things down but these are lamb's
wool socks with sausage dogs on them
these will be so good for wedding socks
anything with sausage dogs on obviously
I just love and conquer wrong with socks
at Christmas another stocking filler
some sour strawberry Millions
and then the last few pieces in here are
actually from my mum so I got the
beautiful Charlotte Tilbury magical mini
brush set and this is encased in the
most beautiful almost metallic snake I'd
say or lizard print case obviously it's
faux and and obviously I travel quite a
lot and makeup brushes take up quite a
lot of room my travel makeup bag is
ginormous
so mum kindly picked up this beautiful
little set so it's got the Charlotte
Tilbury
logo in the rose gold here and then
inside very smart little case you've got
five or is it four four brushes you've
got a blusher bronzer brush and then a
few eye shadows smudging brushes so
really handy perfect for traveling and
such a neat little case as well so this
will be traveling the world with me in
2017
and just such a beautiful little case
really really handy perfect perfect gift
well done at mama and then she also
picked up this which is called sponge l
so she saw this I think she saw
advertised in her spa and it's the
cleanse buff glow shimmer buffer it
looks like this and it feels hard but
apparently when you put it under water
it exfoliates you it goes where you
spongy so you can use it for cleaning
and then also it leaves a bit of shimmer
on the body and it smells amazing so
Charlie and I are actually going to
India at the end of February and I feel
like packing lies it's going to be quite
rough and ready so this will come in
really handy I won't need to take light
loads different body washes and sponges
and if they are more like shower
cubicles and you don't get you know all
the like nice toiletries to get in
hotels which we definitely won't this
will come in really handy and in short I
smell lovely so she picked up that which
is really nice to have a beach product
that's something a little bit more
unusual so I'm looking forward to giving
that a go and then you guys might have
seen these in a recent of local bloggers
melon boxing but a Christmas present to
myself from myself is um these Monica
vinegar pieces so I went to the store
recently again you may have seen in
progress and fell in love with a few
pieces so I just had to make an online
order when I got home the first piece I
picked up I'll leave the official names
and links down below because I don't
know the official names this one is a
ring to add to my everyday ring cluster
which I wear every day and this one has
beautiful tiny tiny diamonds within it
so it really catches the light and I
thought I could replace one of these
stones or one of the stone rings and use
a diamond one instead just to really
elevate my little ring cluster so that's
the first thing that I picked up
second one is another ring this one has
this beautiful diamond design and it's a
little bit more unusual to my usual
cluster perhaps I can wear on the full
finger or the first finger and again it
has the diamonds all the way around the
edges so really beautiful elegant and
light capturing really beautiful design
and then finally I got this gorgeous
bracelet seeing its own little pouch so
I absolutely love to close to my
bracelets they
one you can get personalized I'm not
going to tell you yet what I put
engraved on the back but all become very
clear in a future video so if you've got
any guesses then leave them down in the
comment section and but it's something
very special and yeah
not going anymore but the design in this
bracelet is really beautiful it's pure
rose gold and then it's got the almost
rope like pattern the gold is like
twisted like a rope for the bit which
goes around your wrist and then you've
got this beautiful toggle design which
secures it in place on your wrist so I
love to wear a bracelet cluster as well
as a ring cluster doesn't have to all be
Monaco vinegar there are so many brands
I've been loving recently and but I feel
that this is so classic and yet so
different with the different type of
chain that it will just really elevate
any type of bracelet cluster so those
are the bits I treated myself to and
then I've got two final presents this
one is also from my mum it's a diffuser
set from the spa that she goes to so mum
goes to a spa near where she lives
called penny Hill Park and whenever I go
there I always comment on how amazing it
smells there so she remembered that and
she's picked up a diffuser set so this
is what they have in the spa which makes
it smell so amazing there and it is the
rich aromatic wood scent this is a
top-up a refill and it smells absolutely
heavenly and then a little bit more chic
than your usual
these are charcoal diffuser sticks so a
little bit different to the usual
diffuser set so excited to pull this in
and make my house as smell as amazing as
a spa Oh before I forget I also got an
amazing book from choies little sister
scarlet and is all about natural beauty
and natural beauty products and just
really in-depth information about
ingredients and skincare but I got so
excited by it that I started actually
reading it on Christmas Day and making
notes etc and stupidly left on their
coffee table but luckily were going back
to the house tomorrow but annoying I
can't show you I'll show you in another
video and on snapchat but that was a
really fabulous gift and one that I'm
also very grateful for and then finally
from Charlie's nan she is the absolute
sweetest and his daughter
Rich's for what he calls his granddad I
got actually two boxes but I've already
demolished one of lusted macaroons so I
absolutely love macaroons and these ones
have got like a pearly glaze on them and
they are absolutely delicious she also
put a note in there saying strictly not
for sharing so well I can't say that I
stuck to that I did share a few of them
earlier today and yesterday with mom and
Charlie uh but they are scrumptious I've
got two boxes of those absolutely
spoiled so there's the bits and bobs
that I got for Christmas
absolutely spoiled this year and
everything is really really thoughtful
and lovely so I feel very grateful for
all the bits and bobs I picked up I'd
love to know as well what you guys got
for Christmas let me know in the
comments what your favorite gift was and
also who you spend your Christmas with
because it's far more about who we spend
the time with them what we receive so do
let me know all your Christmas
highlights were what you got just tell
me about your Christmas I would
absolutely love to hear it so that is
all from me I really hope you guys
enjoyed today's video and I'm now going
to tidy away all of my presents have a
little play around with on or two of
them and that's it from me so thank you
