day in the life of log today because
you're going to seem to like my last one
and I've got a really really fun day
ahead so I've just got out of shower and
quickly put some clothes on because
Vicky's coming around in a second but I
wanted to just start by giving you some
very brief first impressions on some new
launches because I undid my blogger mail
first thing this morning
and and I don't know about you but
whenever I get new things I just feel
the need to try them straight away and a
couple of things really just I
absolutely love them so I want to give
them a quick shout out and I had one of
those like majorly pampering showers you
know and you just like exfoliate and you
deep condition your hair so it's one of
those mornings and I've got this blog
mail from Mandara Spa they sent me this
body polish and it is their coconut
shells and coconut oil body scrub so
this is like a creamy body scrub with
all the granules in it
I wasn't like a mega mega scrub like
it's not enough to get rid of your fake
tan but it was just one that I felt so
clean and tropical afterwards it was
like like a holiday in a bottle and then
to make the smell even stronger not
sponsored by the way I just want anyhow
something that I love I used their body
lotion and exotic escape again coconut
and almond oils and my skin smells
amazing so big shout out to Mandara Spa
because I'm used to fears that bits and
bobs before but these were just
literally yeah I feel majorly in holiday
mode now and then the next thing I
wanted to give a shout out to is this
new I don't want to say serum this new
product from Vichy is their mineral 89
fortifying and something daily booster
on the press release it says use of step
zero in your skincare routine so once
you cleanse you put it on before your
serum and it's basically mineral water
with a bit of hyaluronic acid in there
so it is basically plumps the skin and
gives you a little bit of moisture bit
of hydration which is exactly what my
skin leaders today that's all I've got
on at the moment and my skin that looks
and feels pretty good so that's a brief
Beauty update for you on the agenda
today obviously Vicky's coming over in a
second doorbell will be ringing any
second now
and we are going it to something called
house festival and as you may know I'm
not majorly a festival person
I'm not really a I don't know I don't
recall clubbing anymore I'm not very
cool so I was intrigued about the South
Caucasus basically the festival that's
Soho House Bataan which I think most of
you guys will know about they basically
have houses in like LA they have Miami
to her house New York they've got one
also here in the UK they've got
Babbington house and so her farm house
I've logged trips from both of those so
I'll leave them linked on the screen or
down the description box you get a
better idea but they have a festival on
today here in London or just outside
London and it's very exclusive you have
to kind of be a member to go or you have
to I think you have to be a thorough
health member but Vicky and I have been
very kindly invited by grey goose who as
you may know I'm a brand storyteller for
us this year which is a dream role for
me I absolutely adore grey goose I'll
leave a blog post I wrote about the
trips I did with them recently down
below as well but they're going to be
serving their grandkids cocktails at
house festival today
and so the kenai going along as their
guests are going to have a fabulous day
and and yeah very very grateful to great
goose for taking us along so I bring you
guys along with me because I think it's
quite an intriguing festival and should
be a really really fun day excuse the
mess behind me I really don't know what
first of all attire to go for but I'm
wearing my French Connection shorts
which I just love the ones a little
stitching detail I've been wearing you
so much on holiday so I thought I'd wear
them today and then this is a Topshop
blouse it's pretty warm today
blue skies already it was 29 degrees
yesterday when I was at Wimbledon
so Andy Murray playing which was
incredible and but yeah I thought this
top would be it's nice because it's
quite smart but still kind of cool and
festively because I feel like so held
first of all is going to be very
different to most kind of festivals so
yeah and then I'm planning on taking a
backpack I think I'm not sure I've
definitely got a couple of backpacks
somewhere and so I'm probably going to
find a backpack so I do want to take my
big camera with me because I want to get
some instagrams and I want to do a blog
post on it so I'll turn my bag situation
in a second first of all I'm gonna go
downstairs and finish doing some emails
actually do my makeup first finish doing
some emails so that I feel a little bit
more on top of things
or I head out for a day and fun before I
do that though something else very
exciting arrived in my blogger mouth
this morning that I wanted to share with
you that as you may know I have been
using invisible braces for the past like
six months or so and I now have my
second set because I'm a perfectionist
and I wanted to do my top teeth as well
as my bottom teeth
so my aligners arrived this morning from
your smile direct so I'm going to open
them up and put my first ones in whoo
okay so here they are these are the
aligners they look exactly like my old
ones
they're just clear aligners you really
can't tell when you've got them in
although I think you can tell on the
first day because you're not used to
having so much plastic in your mouth you
soon get used to it and no one can tell
you've got them in I am wearing them in
most vlogs and I don't think you guys
ever help but yes this is a company
called your smile direct it's far
cheaper than the more famous invisible
braces I will leave all the information
linked down below because I'm a big big
big fan they have totally like
revolutionized my smile my bottom teeth
you see so jagged if you look back in my
old videos are so wonky and now they're
pretty much straight but I just wanted a
few more tweaks so let's see this is
going to be pretty tight to start with
I'll actually that's really comfortable
that's totally fine and then the top one
let's see oh okay the top ones are a bit
more tight and I feel like I do have a
bit more of a list because I'm not used
to having any plastic on my top teeth
but yeah I'm the wedding today and by
the end of the day hopefully I'll be
totally used to it okay slight change of
plans I'm now going to pick Vicky up on
route because I looked at the uma map
and I go straight past her house I'm
going to show you a very quick finished
outfit and then let's get going so I
decided this was appropriate so top cute
little denim shorts and then I put on
these sandals which you may recognize if
you watched my madrid videos I wore
these pretty much all the time in Madrid
and then I'm taking a backpack so I've
got my big canon camera with me and this
is just a really comfortable backpack
very roomy it's round
made in global but as always I'm going
to leave everything that I'm wearing
links in the description box also got my
lovely Sony's on curl my hair using my
ghd's and yeah that is the finished look
a little bit jewelry on to this is from
a brand called a door and then I've got
my usual Monica's in adore bits and bobs
on very much fake tan hands today so
that's the outfit I've got my essentials
in my bag I've got my battery charger
I've got some Sun cream
I've got makeup top-up but that reminds
me I need to spritz myself I'm obsessed
with this glam glow glow setter this is
just going to set my makeup but still
ensure they're quite a nice globe
and it smells so good I just want to eat
it I feel I just wanting to do in vice
product heavy but yeah so I'm going to
head out now going to get in the goober
and go meet Nick a coalition positions
whirling in my thigh and my fishes a
resolution it's never been time ago is
it when I think the Sweden dog
okey-dokey we are here as a festival and
with my girls and we agreed it was the
coolest s whoever they have cowshed 40
workers in the bathroom in another
country so Holly there are absolute
silence so all behind us are little
tools and and not just like festival
like Sebastian Burgos professor these
oysters lobsters steak like proper fresh
state and crinkle-cut chips
we also excited the resurrection is
we're going to do a lap we're going to
see what is out there

gorgeous cocktail so we're going to have
them look around and see what you can
see really and yes they do have manis
and pedis and massages go go so we just
again they're going to do it yeah
[Laughter]
Oh

getting seriously hot we found a little
bit of shade little bit alarm in the
great boost activation area although
I've got one of their flavorsome fish
tacos in this room and who long teeth
and it will macaron areas here we I
spare your macaron for your console
which Vicki is already doing and loving
such a macaroon mother and even the
little cell walls that were my
Instagram's we're going to but yeah
enjoy yourselves and enjoy
okay so they can I are refreshed
cocktails and now around we're going to
go in the first years ago yeah we're
going to go on the swing II things
whenever that schools and then I think
I'm going to get
and I are both in beauty heaven I'm a
loser in chess
I'm baking a development I know people
have
you
sending an hour decide to the public be
the coolest uncle ever there's no cash
exchange sometimes you just get what
everyone was afraid with the same the in
the queue or espresso machine on top at
the progressive Arkansas shuttle my
package bakery now dragging little man
okay I'm no man I are starting to lag a
little bit so nice yet where those
annoying Koenig from the based on
alcohol a little annoyed but we just
came to the YouTube has been history
Coon and friends we have attention areas
yet you have someone doing iclicker
facials and also houses like just add
about 15 20 minute mark what is an ugly
dolphin couch and I feel so here by size
so I believe all these Justin we're
going to make sure someone is bedding
Marcos's is a whole lot louder because
Sean Paul has just gone so soon as binky
finish to come apart
can I are leaving the party Vicky is
heading q great any cafe monikers
everyone ago her man's birthday party
and I don't want to get used again so
I'm also needing in same time as Beck
this is so fun going it's been so much
harder love it back home again after a
very long but exciting day it's 20 to 9
now so approaching old granny overhears
bedtime and I feel like the festival is
getting to a stage where everyone was a
little bit tipsy and it was definitely
just time for us to leave before things
got a little bit too rowdy I know that's
for a lot of people that's when the fun
starts but for me I'd rather just be at
home now and have a nice meal take my
makeup off have a bit of a pamper and
not have a hangover in the morning
basically so yeah home again now
Charlie's actually in Paris tonight with
Paco Rabanne so I've got the house to
myself I'm really annoyed that the
puppies on here they're at Mom's house
so I'm literally home alone which feels
kind of weird I haven't been home
completely by myself in a long time so
yeah I'm going to have a pamper night
I'm going to do a little bit of work I
don't think I have the brainpower to do
that much but I have got a video that
I'm going to hopefully finish editing
together uploading and yeah I'm just
going to get up super early in the
morning go to gem has a nice productive
day tomorrow so laundering the
background again and yeah I really hope
you guys enjoyed this another one day
