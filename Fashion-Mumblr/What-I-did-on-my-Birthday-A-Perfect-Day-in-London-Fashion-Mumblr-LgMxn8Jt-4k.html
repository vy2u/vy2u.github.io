the 24th today which means it is
somebody's birthday so I thought I would
vlog today and haven't done a normal UK
vlog for quite a while so I'm quite
looking forward to vlogging today and I
am the ripe old age of 25 quarter of a
century
so yeah I'm not really doing anything
crazy to celebrate them it's kind of a
normal day but a fun normal day so I am
working much to the horror of many of my
friends but I feel like if I didn't go
out and work I would just stay at home
and work so I'd rather go out and do fun
things
so my first port of call today is duck
and waffle and I'm going for a breakfast
with a PR that I get along with really
really well so we're gonna have a lovely
catch-up talk about work but also have a
bit of a gossip and duck amore for is
insane if you haven't seen anyone vlog
there before or seen photos
stick around because it's amazing so
that's all I'm gonna say
and then I meant to have another meeting
after that but I think I might cancel it
because I do have a little bit of work I
need to get on with so might find
someone with Wi-Fi and then and I'm most
excited about this I have a facial with
dar fans at their Illuminatus bar and
I'm so excited because darvon facials
are my favorite facials in the whole
world and I've had quite a lot of
facials and they are by far less
relaxing and just perfect thing to do on
your birthday so that's later then I
have an afternoon tea and then I have a
dinner with my girlfriends so it's gonna
be a really really fun day it's just
eight o'clock now I'm about to head out
Charlie and I opened my Prezi embed this
morning and also n stayed over last
night because she had an event in London
although she's dashed off already and a
lot of my presents and cards so far our
sausage dog related let me show you so
these are a couple of bits that's Dexter
actually bought for me
there is a sausage dog shaped cookie
cutter and a sausage dog Christmas tree
decoration with Dexter written on it I
was saying to my mum actually I'm the
hardest person to fight for and also
that easy
he also music yeah so obviously beauty
products is kind of an owner because my
beauty area is overflowing and yeah even
little bits and bobs that Charlie picked
up like cute things
I was sent them as like gifts with PR
packages which is just amazing that
brands are so generous but it doesn't
make it rather challenging but anyone
wanting to buy me some cute little bits
and bobs but also the easiest cuz I feel
like you can just buy me anything with a
sausage dog on it and I'm as happy as
Larry so yeah so I'm gonna head out now
I am wearing a really cute little camera
and roll neck and then my new Yeager
coat which is so warm and I'm actually
gonna grab a top from the dryer because
going to STK for dinner and I'm dressed
far as you cash Leigh let's see
hopefully there's something on here yes
there we go so I've got this little I
know it needs ironing oh do with that in
a second and yeah gonna head out now and
then I will take you guys with me for my
birthday
so I just had a fabulous birthday brunch
with the lovely cast from PBR and we are
up in seven walk home has already gone I
just spent the past 20 minutes here
doing a bit of work but
behind me this is pretty insane this
elevator that can be pretty scary if
you're afraid of heights I'm just going
it down master ground-floor have a look
at this view it's scary
my kids always thought when I go this
left so ya know I'm gonna pop in and
deliver and I'm making my way to the
Illuminatus bar my facial I'm so excited
to just sit back and relax and also I'm
secretly a bit happy that one of my
meetings this afternoon got cancelled so
I may do a little bit of a birthday of
Black Friday shopping as well so
definitely one or two things on my wish
list now I might shoot myself too so
next up
I'm in the Illuminati Spa on oddly
streets which is near Bond Street
completely forgot how blissful this
place is such an oasis like away from
the manic stresses of Oxford Street it's
already heaving for Black Friday just
I'm in the waiting room and even the
waiting room is like a commerce place in
the world beautiful so I'm just filling
in my information sheets and then ready
to relax
Oh
Wow I think that was the most relaxing
experience of my whole life
honestly done facials I just so relaxing
I definitely fell asleep had to
apologize when she finished because I
think I didn't snoring in my mouth open
first time please tell me someone else
does max I always fall asleep in facials
especially the good ones but yeah that
was so relaxing
she used lots of lovely oils lots of
very beautifully scented products I
breathed in a lot of the essential oils
to chill out Oh massage massage even
like some pretty thick face masks that
like set on my face but she peeled it
off it was really satisfying um my skin
looks lovely and glowy I think I'm gonna
get another one of these for Christmas I
did last year as well but I forgot how
good they are so yeah if you want to
treat anyone see some lovely relaxation
for Christmas and definitely recommend
the Delfin facial here at UM Illuminata
I'm gonna go downstairs now and have a
cup of tea and then in about 15 minutes
I'm gonna head to sketch for afternoon
tea
so we just arrived at sketch for
afternoon tea I've just met jammer I've
taken a few pictures on her dolphin will
be some flowers they are such cuties
so Gemma and I I've just been taking a
few photos in sketch because it converts
it to that Christmas wonderland
as you can see behind me there's all
these surgeries covered in snow and
every ten minutes it starts snowing from
the ceiling it's absolutely insane but
yeah let me show you around the stage
because it's probably one of the coolest
places in London come on so afternoon
tea
the toilets here are amazing as well so
I'm really excited to see how the rest
of this place looks because even the
entrance
in fire then we should all burn together
watch the flames climb high into the
night calling out father Oh stand by and
we will watch the flames burn Auburn on
the mountainside the knuckle of each arm
and we're so excited roughing community
as much either I hear speech but we had
flower garland my god it was my uniform
back together
please shoot
watch the legs going over North America
beside the station comes upon the sky
now I see fire inside of now
since I see five
in the trees nicephore
in stoked nicey flower
so time for a little catch-up
I haven't blogged for the past a couple
of hours because I've had so much stuff
with me and see all my bags all around
the place

I'm now at the Emmy Hotel I don't know
what's wrong with my camera focus so I'm
