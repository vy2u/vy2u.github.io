today which means it's my birthday
and I thought I would do a little
birthday vlog some things and some
things today and I thought I would take
you and long with me and so about to
leave home and now it's like 9 o'clock
in the morning so I'm gonna go and get a
facial and I think it's one of these
crazy ones where they do it with like
magic rocks or something so yeah it
should be really good fun and this
morning I was woken up by Dexter jumping
on me try for Dexter into bed with me a
nice cup of tea which was lovely and
then we opened my presents in bed
presents from Charlie Antrim Dexter and
he got me this really cute card as well
which is rather a door for a little
sausage dog on it and then yeah opens
and prezis went downstairs and Charlie
made me pancakes and bacon was my
favorite breakfast in the world I'm
about to go out now to show you what I'm
wearing just do it on the mirror so
birthday outfit of the day is this pink
sparkly jumper you come and see that
it's pink in this light which hopefully
you might have seen in my whole video

earlier this week jeans white jeans from
new look and might Eddie Murphy heels

which have got a little bit of sparkle
and the sides which I love
so yeah heading out now to get my facial
so I've just left the fascia which was
really really lovely not what I was
expecting at all it was his friend
called shale which I believe is a
Norwegian Swedish is basically all about
harnessing the power of gemstones which
I really didn't know that much about
that is really cool this guy brought
Henrique who flies all over the world
doing this treatment use like rose
quartz and my bed was made of like
amethyst crystals also really about the
energy behind the gemstone so it's
really very unusual and facial and I
came out looking really scary my hair I
don't if you can see is completely
covered in oil which I was not expecting
I was having a bad headache anyway Bob
just mesh booking that for last-minute
blow-dry of

quite natural looking and I did too
badly with my contour this time normally

anything it's too bad today and and then
this is the lipstick that I mentioned in
my Topshop haul the other day it's the
lip palette in the shade Motel so really
really like this makeup the lighting is
appalling I'm really sorry that could
