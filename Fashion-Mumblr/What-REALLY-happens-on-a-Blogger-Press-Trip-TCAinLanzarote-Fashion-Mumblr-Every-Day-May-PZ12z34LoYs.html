with here with a load of other bloggers
were on a bit of a a blogger press
stroke today hope you guys enjoyed my
fly with me video beginning so this vlog
should be quite fun opportunity if you
guys see what happens on a typical
Blanca first trip I always say they're a
little bit like school trips always and
itinerary and things to do so today on
Clarkson Ancelotti is a really volcanic
country I'm pretty sure we're at the top
of volcano right now that'd be but mine
is pretty spectacular
ah
current situation stretching hopefully
then we'll make has no words so we're
gonna walk to the top of the hill
hopefully the bus will be able to make
it now that we are we made it up the
hill but the bus is now making a rather
sinister baby
oh gosh I'm going off terrain
sun is shining and we've had rum isn't
that right guys fibrin we haven't died
that's right on round three stop okay
we're at the priests top of the green
lake
marring the power of Photoshop this is
the before photo
and this is after we need Mike to teach
us how to do
logging in a little while is you hours
later it's about 6 o'clock now we've
come to a place called Las Colinas and
we're going to have dinner here
but we're here for sunset it's a bit of
a salt farm
I think I've logged assault from you
might be like a year ago the same kind
of thing here's the lands behind me
that's patchwork II that's where they
dry out sea water so all the water
evaporates leaving the salt so that's
where we are at the moment I just come
outside to get a breath of fresh air and
I can step away from the group for a
little bit everyone's really really
lovely but it's bit overwhelming
sometimes I just need to you by myself
sometimes
so I've just come outside to just chill
out a little bit I think maybe the rum
at lunchtime is also going to my husband
with coffee maybe having a bit of a
sugar low missing home a little badly
tsunami I get homesick I am a little bit
on this trip not sure why
so yeah that's a little confession from
me
oh my gosh and now there's a dog and I
feel better again a little baby
it's 9:45 and we are all back in our
hotel rooms now everyone is absolutely
exhausted
we've been out of the hotel for 12 hours
doing the tour of Lanzarote and everyone
is just so not good I've even had like
three coffees today and I still feel
absolutely shattered I think it's just
emotionally exhausting being busy and
engaged all day so yeah everybody's
having an early night I came home Oh
came back to the hotel room to find my
video is still only on 55% from last
night this is a downside of doing
everyday Maimon time traveling is that
you just can't rely on the Wi-Fi so this
means I'm running one day behind with
everyday main out because there was no
video today and today's video is going
to go tomorrow so I'll try and catch up
at some point maybe if I have a boring
day I just won't blog and then though I
don't really have any boring dates
capping him up maybe one of my meeting
days because you guys know my meeting
days are and I just won't flog that day
so that everything gets back up to track
um what else do I have to report I still
have a really weird voice I haven't
really recovered from losing my voice on
the airplane I think I think tends to do
that to me um music isn't so loud
tonight last night there was like a band
playing into the Levin some Beatles band
right outside my room but they're not
there tonight which is good yeah that's
pretty much all I have to report I'm
going to take my makeup off now slather
my skin in a moisture mask I feel kind
of dirty and grainy from like all the
lava everywhere so yeah I'm gonna have a
good old scrub check that my video is
actually uploading and catch an early
night so oh I just came home to also
find 18,000 subscribers so thank you so
much if you are subscribed 18,000 it's
just crazy amount of people I can't even
imagine all that those people in one
place there's a lot of people thank you
if you are subscribed if you're not then
please do makes me very happy
um and yeah hope you enjoyed this vlog
and I'll see you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
