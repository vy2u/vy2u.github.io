me for yet another christmas gift guide
as you can tell I have I have my darling
char I have a plus one today what's up
Charlie had to practice what he was
gonna say this is industry I'm quite
happy with this up so Charlie in case
you don't know is my boyfriend and I
have invited him along for his expertise
in voice basically yeah
gives you guys this Christmas mm-hmm so
we are going to go through our top 10
ish gifts that would be amazing for your
brother your father important men in
your life
yes not the unimportant ones not be
honorable no basically I'm just gonna
hand over to chart because I can't take
any credit for this you've pretty much
put together all of these I'm you know I
have yeah and I think this year there's
loss it's just yes I find it's easier
every year to pick things easier yeah as
a guy from picking names for girls is
changing that for a guy I think there's
just so many options out there
especially when it comes to male
grooming shaving technology there's so
much tech yeah and I think I think you
think that you because this is your
first year charlie is now been a
full-time blogger for over a year
yeah I think it's made it easier yeah I
think it probably has made it easier and
then it's made it harder picking you
know choosing between all the amazing
brands that are out there it's gonna
make you harder to buy for all that
stuff yeah so welcome to my world now
yeah I for you as possible so the first
thing that we're going to talk about is
fragrances these are two of Charlie's
favorites John explain why you mm oh
yeah so first I think France is
obviously a great gift at Christmas
because I think people don't often treat
themselves especially into this luxury
exactly so I think Frances are an
amazing gift of Christmas so don't be
put off by the fact they're they're
quite a common present so this is by
John Malone and this is the myrrh and
tonka and this is probably my favorite
all-time favorite scent of 2017 every
time I wear this I get compliments which
must mean it's eraser yeah it is on the
Shirou price point wise but I think with
that you get all the amazingness of the
German own friend you get the amazing
packaging you get the fabulous
experience yeah and you're not gonna
you're not gonna have a lot of friends
wearing this no so it's worth the
investment and I like that it's quite
masculine in the bottle you've got the
black new kind of yeah looks quite manly
on your dressing table and then why have
you chosen this one so this is by David
Beckham and it's his latest fragrance
which is called respect latest yeah so
he's had a number of fragrances yeah
yeah and actually this one caught me by
surprise a little bit because I wasn't
the biggest fan of his previous
fragrances no offense Dave if you are if
you're watching yeah we're best mates
now because I met David Beckham a few
about two months ago
yeah and we are on on first-name terms
and he will not stop going on about it
yeah exactly
best buds and it does actually this one
has a little message for me from from
Big Dave but you know this is this heavy
blade this this isn't an awesome
fragrance because firstly it's as little
as 15 pounds which for an aftershave in
the world we live in is incredibly
affordable
so check out boots or super job Josie
link in below but in terms of like the
reason I love it the reason I love this
is it's got a number of ingredients that
are quite standouts a grapefruit being
one so it's very citrusy quite fresh I
think it's a great after gym fragrance
yeah I'm after playing sport I think
this smells better the longer it's worn
because when you came home after the
event in Duncan well that's the Vltava
so the better but is a bass note so that
will come through later on and better by
is just an amazing scent hmm yeah so I
think this is an amazing stocking filler
or a great gift for a brother or someone
like that so they reckon respect respect
next we're going to talk about a few
grooming products and charlie is very
well qualified to talk about this and
you have been writing about grooming
yeah more skincare been grooming no
stuff was on the categories but yes
skincare I'm a big fan of my skincare
moment I find it really funny
when Charlie finished just playing rugby
because he tells me look at the guys in
the changing room afterwards always
asking you for like skincare tips yeah
and these the kind of guys that
typically wouldn't want to use a
moisturizer but now starting to realize
yeah I need that under eye cream
it's the taboo is sort of broken down
yeah I think so
so both these are from an up series yes
no so basically the reason I picked this
is I'll tell you in a minute this is the
main gift idea which is a lab series
gift sex I think gift sets are obviously
great present Christmas lab series is a
brand that I've always known off but
I've fallen in love with a bit more in
the last few months trying out some of
their hero products so this one in
particular which is actually called the
all-in-one face hydrating gel very big
mouthful you have this in the bathroom
when I first yeah so well that's just an
all around my base of shower and hair
hair product so it's an all-rounder
basically this is exactly as new say so
this is the for me this is an amazing
gift for guys that workout or to
playschool because these three products
basically sort you out and it's in a
really nice box the reason I chose this
is as a stocking filler this is the
urban blue detox mask and it's a clay
mask and I love it because it's blue
it's a bit more masculine so for guys
that haven't used face masks or aren't
as comfortable with face masks this is
quite a good sort of entry-level product
yeah I think it's about 20 quid so it's
of good stocking filler as well and it's
what I find you look a bit like a smurf
it's quite jokes but it's also really
really good face mask it's like poor
housing yeah so this is great if you
want to get your boyfriend interface
last night Monday March my next we have
something that would probably be a main
present this is slightly on the more
pricey side but a really good gift for
any age I would say this one is a
special style what was different explain
what yes
so Philips have collaborated with Star
Wars for the launch of the new film
which I think's I in a few weeks I'm
quite excited about and in terms of the
reason I chose this is obviously Star
Wars is very inner
moment but the shaver itself I tried it
recently and I was a really big fan so I
sort of go in between wet shaving and
using an electric shaver and this is
really good if you in the rush if you're
someone that meets or if your boyfriend
or someone that needs to be clean-shaven
for work this is a great tool to use in
the morning so it's really quick it's
quite clean so it catches all the hairs
it's also a really sleek design and it
comes in a little pouch she's really
good for travel but ultimately I mean
every guy has to shave unless you know
unless you really really love a
long-long Hagrid s bit but yeah I mean
for me I love this shameful I think
because it's the Star Wars one it makes
it a bit more fun for a kid yeah because
I think behind someone a razor is quite
a practical gift so the fact that is
Star Wars makes it a little bit more fun
a bit more interesting they've got like
a light that bit the lights up there's a
bit like a lifesaver I wish it made the
noise I did wish it no it's true oh yeah
I thought that would be quite cool but
it's yeah it's a great gift and I think
the clean shave is coming back I'll just
leave it like that I'm gonna be blogging
a lot about it but it is not I think I
think beards and massages are great but
I think they've had that they've had
that day the last few years clean shave
this next one is probably my favorite
thing to talk about in the gift guide it
is a pair of swimming trunks from all
about brown and all of our brown
actually I hadn't heard of until I met
Charlie and your big big fan about brown
yeah I've always been a fan of them they
are quite a high price point which
initially put me off and then when I
first got a pair I sort of understood
why they are more expensive because
you're paying for the quality and the
fact they dry quickly yeah and the
design is you know is sleek they look
really smart so you can wear the night
from beach to bar in a restaurant if you
have to like obviously wear normal
clothing than they do pass as normal
shorts but this particular are very
special and if you follow Charlie on
Instagram
may have already spotted them but have a
look at these oh my goodness so
obviously these are personalized pair of
swimming trunks they have got little
babies on there so that no matter where
you travel in the world
they're called snapshots so basically
their service that all of our brand
offer I think they've offered it for a
few years now where you can turn any
photo into your own pair yeah and they
were sort of like to me they're like oh
why don't you you know the Maldives or
something like that and I thought no I
want my dogs on my swim shorts so that
whenever we truffle we can take dextran
Dickens with us everywhere so I'm gonna
be wearing these a lot in the Maldives
lookout smoke gangster looks yeah he's
like he's proud he's a proud brother cuz
he's got Stern dickens first trip away
together wasn't that yeah because it's
grown a bit since then yeah so now no
matter where we travel in the world
we'll always have our two handsome men
with us but so you can get any picture
I think this for me aside from boyfriend
or husband it's an amazing gift I think
it's quite gift for Dad
yeah like you know that's you know
that's cool
oh yeah no but I even found it like even
a good family photo meet could be
anything I mean I'm not gonna lie I
wouldn't mind it my new her new face of
Papa maybe not so the next gift on sort
of the luxury theme is an umbrella from
London undercover now these are brand
new I am you discovered lobbyist on last
year when we were kindly sent a bigger
version of this this one I picked up I
actually bought this recently and it's
just a much smaller size so it's perfect
for your backpack yeah I leave it in my
day bag because I'm just assuming you
just have to assume it might rain in
London mm-hmm
it's the handle that makes it it's just
really nicely done
this is a kind of gift because it is a
higher price point I feel like you
wouldn't necessarily treat himself to
because spending over 100 pounds right
it's no there 6000k yeah which I think I
think is good value because it's it's
made well made but you still might not
spend that on
for an umbrella but everybody uses
umbrellas especially if you live in
England so very practical good good for
traveling as well I think lighting this
I've taken it I took it when we went to
Vermont yeah it didn't actually rain so
we recognized so nice it's beautifully
crafted I think it's one of those sort
of presents that will catch someone off
guard a bit because as you say with it
yeah it's a cool brand like an
undercover yeah so this next one was
actually meant to be a gift for Charlie
but we really wanted to include it in
this video so surprise you already know
it's coming it is the Michael Kors watch
is the male version of my watch which
I'm sure you guys know how much I love
this and Charlie keeps spotting it and
being like Oh wish they had a male
version well they do
so this is the Michael Kors access
SmartWatch for guys this in this amazing
brushed silver color and I know that
Charlie does have a watch it looks like
this so I know you like this design and
then as with mine which I'm sure you all
know all about it's got the completely
digital display so it tells you
obviously the time they get your
notifications like your Instagram your
YouTube you get your whatsapp so you
can't pretend to ignore me anymore
because your wrist will literally by the
way I like I like as a guy I like the
idea of using mobile phones now are
quite a bit bigger and that's a is quite
nice to not have you know if your phone
is just on your desk at work or if it's
in your gym bag or whatever it's nice
being able to have this just in cases an
emergency as well or even just out
curious do you like in the middle
meeting or if you're walking around you
don't want to have to be that's how we
can see a wrist it tells you who's text
use I'm excited to use this I think I
think also Michael Kors do a couple with
rubber strap which is maybe more suited
to the gym well you can change the strap
so in mine either looks like it comes oh
say can I get a rubber strap see the
strap actually comes off so you can just
put the watch face on it so I can get a
run a strap mm-hmm well that's cool what
I also love about this over
the tech watches is that it's actually a
really nice disaster fashionable yeah it
actually looks like the female one it
looks really good I actually think no
offense to many of you that may have it
but I don't think the iWatch is
particularly attractive
whereas this looks like a really sleek
watch design and then it has these
amazing features in it as well it's not
a ridiculous price either obviously this
is a main gift and it is something you
know what boys are like with technology
you'll really enjoy on Christmas day
just like setting it up which is really
easy by the way and then yeah we will be
his-and-hers with our and I think also
is a guy not only would you be excited
about that but once again I think it's
not something that you would necessarily
go much about it'd be a nice surprise
present yeah so if there is one thing
that Charlie has been obsessed with this
year almost as much as Dex from Dickens
it has been coffee
so naturally the next thing it's an
orphan machine a coffee machine yeah
coffee for me especially working from
home now and that we don't really have
any coffee shops that nearby the house
it's really important to have a good
coffee machine yeah and Nespresso I've
become obsessed with I think you were
obsessed as well yeah because it's just
easy you know the coffee's amazing but
it's easy with the pods not messing
around the coffee beans in all of that
and this Nespresso machine is the mini
ones it's called a sensor mini and
basically the reason I chose this is the
price point really caught me by surprise
I think it's $89.99 which for a coffee
machine a really good quality one is
very good value yeah and I hope my
brother doesn't watch this but this is
their gift he doesn't maybe means girl
for my but they're moving into their
house together for the first time
yeah and so it's an amazing gift for
someone that's you know just getting
getting started in the house yeah as you
said I think this would be a really good
gift for someone that has just moved
into a new place maybe you know a couple
and they've just moved in together
then this is a really nice gift and it's
a small size yeah it's quite as compact
as well we've we've got the slightly
larger version because we've got a bit
more space but you know especially if
you live in London or in an apartment
you don't want to be taking up too much
space
yeah exactly and then when it comes to
stocking fillers they
they're festive capsules these are
licorice which I'm actually not too sure
how I feel about orange yet can we make
these extra yeah the orange one sounds
amazing I didn't want to open the box
but I want to try that later and the
snowball yeah so potentially if you
already if you know someone that's
already got a machine then the
Christians flavor coffees a very nice
talking filler these last three are more
stocking fillers but equally wonderful
gift ideas charlie is obsessed with
candles I feel like it's no longer like
just a girl thing huh I don't know
obvious about i was going to talk about
this so it will firstly candles for me
you know especially when you first sort
move into a new home it's quite a quite
important thing 7 mood
I think cameras are definitely now very
much unisex yeah like guys are getting
more into it I think maybe in previous
years guys knew that they liked the
ambience of a candle but there weren't
many masks a sense that is epic so this
isn't so this is Russian leather by
Molton Brown I most amount obviously
have I think probably about ten candles
at least with their different scents but
this one I've got this the fragrance is
also really really nice but yes a
Russian leather you've got lots of ours
almost and like tobacco II almost
whiskey this is this is a really really
nice actually percent yeah I think I
think perfect for perfect for a guy I
also thought like these next couple of
gifts including this or also really good
Secret Santa gifts yeah I mean this is
probably about twenty pounds I think
which is quite a bit but it's still you
know that's an amazing Secret Santa gift
more a stocking gift all for an uncle or
extended family right it's going so I
can't believe I'm about to show this on
my youtube channel but next I have a
pair of Charlie's boxes here shows me
that they've only been worn a couple of
times yeah that's gross but next exit so
basically let's let's get to it
Bjorn Borg are my go-to for boxes why
don't you not get a new pair because
well okay
having arrived here so I did order some
new ones with Black Friday actually
because I don't have my 40% off yeah
she's amazing yeah
so if you're bored have always been my
favorite box around probably since I was
like 15 but these are actually I think
they're called microfiber so it's like a
blend between like an undershirt that
you might wear cycling or playing rugby
and a boxer so the reason I love them is
they're perfect for the gym obviously
they're a bit more of a lighter fabric
and they're more fitted so they're
amazing for life so I clean running any
sort of gym work I think they're an
amazing stock infinite and they come in
really bright colors you have family
friends that buy your books every year
yeah so for me like you never have too
many boxes so yeah great stocking and I
think these are about $14.99 so good
thank you
moving swiftly on last but not least and
this I think is a really really good
gift but potentially not the most
exciting but one that will get used a
lot Charlie introduced me to this and
this year and I've actually spoken about
it in my five ways to style over the
boots video as the best way to care for
suede shoes now if you know a guy that
is into his fashion he likes to invest
in Footwear and this is a really really
good gift and well not just Footwear so
so the reason the reason I love it is so
suppose it's a protector but liquid
proof is the brand is it dragons done I
don't think it is the one like it could
be I don't know but the reason it's
great it's not it's more of a like
liquid spray rather than like an aerosol
spray and you've got to make sure you do
spray fair enough distance from the
product but for suede shoes is great but
also I've been wearing on a suede honors
I've got like four or five suede bomber
jackets which a couple of are quite
expensive so you want to protect them
and this does as good a job on noses as
as you want you know this is like a mega
protection spray so if you spray your
clothes and your shoes with this then it
literally makes them waterproof like the
water droplets don't even see me
I mean I mean according to them you only
really need to spray it once personally
I like to just top it up every couple of
weeks but you don't need to use it like
you maybe would a suede spray every time
you worth I think it's about $9.99 an
hour's in something like that this is a
smaller bottle but I just thought it's a
great you know great stocking fit up one
thing that you do without it so those
are our top 10 ish I don't actually top
11 and Christmas gifts for men I really
hope you found this useful thank you
dying for your good for me they are
really good picks actually I think that
these are all amazing gifts like this
year I kind of went and picked
everything that I would love to receive
for Christmas in a way I think most
people do that don't they yeah true but
sometimes you think about the broader
guy but I think I think these gifts
cover all bases yeah they do
they're already guess where I'm dying
and so that is all from us thank you for
coming and joining me on this video and
that is all from us thank you so much
for watching this is all thank you so
much for watching and we will see you
very soon I will in my son bye
yeah dude all right
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
