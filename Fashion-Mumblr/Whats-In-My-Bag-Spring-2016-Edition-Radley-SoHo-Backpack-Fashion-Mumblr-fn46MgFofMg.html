back to my youtube channel I hope you're
all having a really really nice week I
can't concentrate with this little chap
on me I know I've been getting a few
comments recently being like where's
Dexter and you haven't seen him in a
while so I thought I would just give him
his own little cameo um yeah he is he's
really well he's become even more
mischievous since he last saw him and
he's quite chilled out at the moment
look at him oh I just love him so much
oh my baby oh my god the way that he
cuddles me it's just too much ah yes I
thought I would just give Dexter a
little bit of camera time um there he is
he's really well he is frequently
appearing in my snapchat so if you do
miss him on my youtube then make sure
you follow me on snapchat I'm gonna pop
him on my lap now so that I can get on
with today's video so today I'm filming
a what's in my handbag video I have not
done one of these in quite a long time
and in fact the only other one that I've
done was also a Radley backpack it was
the Radley Neil Street backpack last
time and now it's the Radley Soho
backpack which is this spring's version
I absolutely love backpacks I find them
so good for traveling so good for when
you just have lots of things in your
arms are just so practical so this is
the bag that I've been carrying around
for the past few months or so as you
might be able to see it is completely
round and full and I was about to have
oh okay
he's just scurrying around I was about
to have a bag pair up because I feel
like I might actually be ruining the
leather with helpful it is but before I
did a clear-out I thought I would film
what's in my handbag video so as I said
the bag itself is the Radley soho
backpack compared to the last one it's
much smoother leather it's still grey I
just find grey is such a classic color
just goes with everything it's really
beautiful very simple very timeless so
it's lovely grey backpack you've got the
Radley detail up there with London on
like a little plaque and then it's got a
long zip which goes all the way down on
this side and then up and finishes quite
near the top on that side which really
means that you can open up the bag and
get quite far in on the back you've got
a handle which means that if you don't
want to carry it as a backpack you can
just carry it like this and then you've
got the two adjustable straps I normally
just use one strap just sling it over my
shoulder like that and then inside there
is all of my crap and bulging out and
also a lovely pink lining just need to
change the camera battery be right back
and I'm back hopefully the lighting on
positioning hasn't changed too much back
to my backpacks so I'm just gonna get
started digging inside my bag showing
you what I find obviously I have not put
stuff in here to make it more
interesting in fact I think it might
actually be quite boring um yeah I have
really done anything that would mean
that I have exciting stuff in here I'm
really not selling this videos I'm gonna
be quiet the first thing that is in my
bag is my ginormous makeup bag this I
don't actually usually travel around
with this huge makeup bag considering
that the bag itself is not actually that
big and the reason why I have this
makeup bag in here is because I went to
an event with soft and gentle deodorant
last week or a few days ago and it was
at call collective my shower afterwards
which might have had steam my makeups
I had my makeup bag in there I will very
quickly go through what's in here
because there may not be too much else
interesting in my bag and it's the zoeva
makeup bag you've probably seen this
before it's what my rose gold and
brushes came in a little while ago and
inside I just have a few daily
essentials first thing in there is my
girl on four seasons terracotta bronzer
now I have this one in there because it
has a nice mirror if I can get into it
which is really handy when you're doing
your makeup go just generally a really
nice bronzer and it's hard to make
yourself orange or any kind of
unflattering color with discs it's such
a gorgeous shade I know actually sure I
have a bronzer brush in here so maybe I
took that out already also I have the
girl on saying range terracotta John 18
foundation a game is super duper easy
once you apply and I've told you how
much I love that in other videos and
this is the small Zoe the silk finish
and face shape brush which is one of the
brushes that came with this bag so it's
a really nice one for quite precise
foundation application and smaller than
the silk finish one for applying a
foundation on the go I also have my SH
antique eye eyeliner this is a black
kind of felt of Iona a nice skinny one
and really small packaging so really
good for carrying around on the go and I
have my Urban Decay brow beater
I would not leave the gym without my
eyebrows in place hence why I have this
in here and it's a lot quicker and
easier to do than if I was to use for
example my anastasia dipbrow so that's
why i have that in there then I have a
little perfume this is a little sample
pot of wire cells black opium such a
gorgeous fragrance and I love the size
of this bottle it's obviously not like a
retail one I think it's just like a
sample but gorgeous fragrance and really
handy
bottles so that's in my makeup bag as
well as a tiny little bottle of Viktor &amp;amp;
Rolf flowerpot this perf you might
actually prefer the smell off it's just
not quite so easy to apply because it's
in kind of the drippy bottle where you
have to just kind of punch through the
lid and double it on like this whereas
this one's a lot easier to spray if I
should probably just choose one or the
other that's a bit excessive trying to
perfumes in that I also have a little
selection oh I have my waterproof
mascara by Carens wouldn't normally
carry such a huge on scar around but
again it's because I didn't want to have
to have black eyes after showering so I
applied this before going into the gym
because it's so waterproof and then what
I normally carry in my makeup bag is
this which is a really tiny mini version
of benefit roller lash just a really
really good mascara I think I got this
at Elle magazine and it's really handy
size then I have a couple of lip
products we've got my favorite lipstick
at the moment which is Tom Ford first
time just an absolutely gorgeous pink
this is pretty much my everyday color so
even if I didn't have my makeup bag in
my handbag I would probably still have
this lipstick and now I've also got a
lip liner this is the Revlon Colorstay
in blush not actually a huge fan of this
but it's a very similar shade to the Tom
Ford I just wish I had a little bit more
umph to it I wish it came up a little
bit more whereas it's very very subtle
quite hard to see on the lips I've got
an eyeshadow brush in there as well
which I've been using with the Clinique
what's this called lid pop in cocoa pop
so very easy to apply quite a neutral
kind of brown color again this is
because I just needed to do something to
my makeup after showering off in the gym
session and last but not least in my
makeup bag is my boat amaretto creme
mattes creme lip crayon which is another
one of my classic lip colors I just find
that if I don't know what to do if I'm
kind of stuck for a lip color and this
is just an essential you know I just
wear it and I know that
an absolute favorite I think this was in
my top 10 of 2015
and another in 2016 I love it just as
much the only other thing in here really
randomly is a mini mini mini pair of
tweezers that says and Nuvo dashes on
them so I guess they're actually false
lash tweezers but I would probably just
use them for on-the-go emergencies
there's a little zippy pocket in here as
well there's gonna be like tampon and
eventually it's a load of samples so I'm
a hoarder when it comes to magazine
samples and I would hate to be like out
somewhere and run out of foundation or
not have any moisturizer after the gym
so I always collect little samples I've
got L'Oreal Revitalift we've got did
your star foundation oh my gosh it's so
many Rimmel BB cream another dior star
Rimmel lasting perfection Garnier pure
active so I like to have little sachets
with me they're so handy when you're
traveling because chances are if you
forgot a lotion then you've got to the
sample of it so they are the last things
in my makeup bag I'm gonna put all the
pieces back in there now back to the
actual bag it's looking a little bit
empty now which is good I'm gonna go
into the inside pocket this is a pocket
that doesn't have as it looks like quite
a lot of rubbish so you've got an empty
mentos packet I bought these in Hong
Kong I'm not sure if you can buy mentos
in the UK I really really like that and
see if you can then let me know and let
me know web because I love these sweets
and only kind of by the moment to Spain
or places like that then we have a very
tattered looking Topshop and lip bullet
in the shade Motel app so you love this
it's similar to the bite Mac creme lip
crown in color and the fact that I can
just stick it on and know that
look good as you can see - just really
well-loved I've worn this an awful lot I
already bought a replacement for when
this runs out because I hate to think
what would happen if they discontinued
this so that's also locking in my
handbag pocket along with few receipts
and we've got Zara Kampf Arden French
Connection
our girls streets another French
Connection one and then a next refund
voucher I took a bag back to next so
that's the receipt that I have if you
wanted to know what they're for oh
what's this oh my gosh also in that
pocket I have the button - the Ted Baker
trousers which I don't know if you
remember me saying I think I've featured
them in like a favorites video or a
whole video and I was like the only
downsides of the buttons falling off
here is the button I need to save that
back on alrighty I have just seen what
is next in the bag and it's a pure bag
which I will just skip over and dexter's
little mini water bottles so this I
picked up in Hong Kong I did actually
have a bigger one in the UK but this is
so handy if you have a pet and you take
him or her around with you because it
folds up flat very light very small and
then you pop it out and it becomes a
little water bottle or a little food
pots and I can also make it half height
as well well for a bit of laughing you
can anyway which is great for Dexter
obviously because he's so tiny it comes
with a little clip as well so if you
were that way inclined you could dangle
it from your bag but personally I don't
want to have it hanging from my rad new
bag so yeah I've got Dexter's little
portable water bowl
and then I have a ziplock bag full of
Dexter's food if you're wondering it's
the James well beloved
ducking rice boots so that's because I
took this bag to watch I play rugby last
weekend and I always take those three
bits and bobs with me wherever I go with
Dexter Casey gets hungry or in case he
pees so they are my doggy essentials the
next thing in here is my purse now I say
my purse not like my purse because this
is not my normal person normally I have
my big Kate Spade purse which you would
have seen in my last what's in my hand
my video but this is my kind of travel
purse and I just haven't switched back
since I got back from Hong Kong because
my Kate Spade one pink one is so much
bigger so bulky and so heavy and I found
that actually I've just been kind of
surviving on this one recently and it's
also Kate Spade I also picked this up
for the Kate's big sample sale for
around the 20 pound mark and I just have
a few very very like basic essentials in
here I've got two credit cards or credit
and a debit card I have a Sainsbury's
and a bills receipt a next gift card on
a forever 21 gift card and then I just
have a mixture of UK money and Hong Kong
dollar Hong Kong coins the no.5 Hong
Kong dollars so that is what's in my
little Kate Spade purse I'm actually in
the market for a new purse at the moment
I want something about this size but a
little bit smarter because this really
is kind of my travel purse only I'm
using in the moment because as I said
it's such a handy size and it's got this
little loop on it as well so if ever I'm
going out I don't take a bag with me my
phone I think just about fits in there
I've got the six plus it doesn't fit in
many things but just about fits in there
so that's my purse in my bag then I have
my oyster wallet exactly the same as it
was last time with my rare card my ID
and my oyster card although I have at
the moment been using my you know you do
the double tap on your phone you get
credit credit card up that's what I've
been using more than moments because so
handy and I always have my phone out and
but that's my Kate Spade Oyster wallet
also practical I have my keys I think
since I lasted what's in my hand like I
have a new keyring which is this one
which I got from Locke's town I think it
was part of a Christmas gift set that
they did it and then I have a really old
and battered Marc Jacobs Daisy dream
keychain my Soho Jim toggle and then my
three house keys already we have an
iPhone cable because I also think in
here somewhere
yes I do I have a portable charger which
is just so handy if I ever spend the day
in town then it is really really handy
to be able to top at my phone charge
while I'm out and about this is a nice
little pink pink lipstick see this is a
nice pink lipstick shaped one I got it
the Clarins multi active event it says
Karen's on one side and how to type
multi actor on the other and it has
about two full phone charges I'd say so
really really handy for on the go
charging off my phone what else do we
have we have my portsmouth mirror which
I think also is in last times was my
handbag it's just a really really huge
mirror a little bit dirty at the moment
but really handy for apply makeup on the
go I just love how big it is how light
it is my house limit is and this is
probably one of my favorite purchases
for a long long time I'll leave a link
to where I got this from down below
because it's so handy if you do makeup
while you're out and about honestly I
love it so much what else do we have
I have got my iPhone earphones a little
bit tangled normally I don't really
listen to music that much on the go this
is more for kind of editing on the go I
think probably charlie just was tidying
up and put these in my handbag because
yeah I don't really listen to music when
I'm out and about
have many long train journeys I live
like 20 minutes from central London so
it's I just really reply to my emails on
the train not listen to music today but
probably in there because Charlie tied
them away then we've got a key Australia
or Quay whatever you want to call it
Australia's sunglasses case and my
lovely rose gold pink kind of cat I won
these these are so gorgeous I absolutely
love wearing these I think I wore them
on my head the other day and actually
been admits inside these kind of nozzle
bits so I need to sit around I swear
they are wonky on my face but they look
on me they feel a bit wonky and the FC
love these again I'll leave a link to
where I got these from down below
because they're so gorgeous and this
summer coming up it's nice to treat
ourselves to some nice new sunglasses
so I have two relatively boring items I
have some neurofen Express um targets
fast pain relief really good for period
pain that's why I've got those in there
um and then I have some Trident splash
chewing gum I was actually pretty
disappointed with this I thought the
splash was going to be really nice and
gooey and refreshing on the inside but
it was actually not that gooey so yeah
nice flavor but the splash bit little
bit of a letdown then we're getting to
the bottom of the bag this is so fun so
this is a new tangle teezer with some
hugs on it and it's got like this
handbag shield so you don't pick up all
the crap from the body or how bad your
earphones don't get tangled up in it but
it is just a normal but small tangle
teezer um I just find it so handy to my
um bag before this I never really used
to carry a hairbrush around in my bag I
think I actually asked at the end of
last what some another pipe I said is
there anything that you would have
expected me to have in my bag that I
don't and a few people said a hairbrush
they made me think I
my hair does get so naughty when I'm out
and about so I did have a normal hair
brush in there and then when I got this
and it launched a couple of weeks ago
I've had this in the bottom my handbag
and I use it so much perhaps oh you love
it
so cute little pub design I'm really
really handy and nice and light as well
then we get to the bottom look kind of
like a rubber sheet bits and bobs
although we do have some more makeup I
have my clinic no it's the Chanel and
we'll have my Chanel kind of Foundation
compact so you've got a mirror you've
got a sponge and then you've got a
foundation that kind of cream
consistency foundation and which I
really like really good for topping up
on the go whether I'm getting a bit oily
or my makeups just disappeared for my
chin which is what normally happens at
about 3 o'clock so that's really handy
talent there I've got my clarence hijack
wrench lip balm moisturizer lip balm I
think I always thought this is called
hydrocracker but doesn't actually say
that anywhere so maybe I made that up
this is the moisture of finishing lip
balm with essential rose wax just a
really lovely moisturizing lip balm and
really handy to have a nice bomb in your
bags especially on datum is a little bit
windy and it's kind of biting outside
just love that one 2 pounds I've got
this one not from the key key K which is
just a very plain blue by row type pen
it writes really nicely and then I have
this Estee Lauder one which I think I
kind of nicked from their offices I went
to an event there now so I can take this
pack three snazzy and they're like yeah
just go for it so I have a very snazzy
Estee Lauder pen also in my handbag and
then I was holding a lip balm but it's
disappeared I did also have a benefit
cha-cha tint but it's gone so I can't
show you that one and last few pieces I
have a gold Kirby grip which probably
was in my hair and then I took it out
then I have hair bubble and
and even thinner hair bubble I want I
like to get blonde ones because then
it's not too obvious and you can kind of
hide a little better if they match your
hair color I got those from boots ooh
then I have this really cool thing which
is like a handbag table hanger so
basically you get these in my crackers
and it rolls up to be really really tiny
like this little circle and then when
you get it out you put this bit you put
that bit on the table and you hang your
bag from this so really good if you
don't want to put your bag on the floor
or if you think it might be safer to
have your bag have you just by your
knees it's really tiny and it's
surprising the amount of times I
actually use this I always feel a little
bit dorky like I'm just gonna hang my
bag on the table but actually I find it
very very useful so that's in that three
and stray Hong Kong dollars actually
that's a pound that's a pound as well
not Hong Kong doors talk to English
pounds and a Hong Kong two-dollar coin
which is kind of like a really scalloped
edge 50p piece I have a little Dexter
biscuit as well it was just lurking in
the bottom now so I'm just gonna throw
that on the floor because he will come
and move that up within a few minutes I
can guarantee it
and the last couple of bits and bobs in
the bottom of my bag are two rolled-up
cream egg wrappers so just the metallic
on fully bits from the Easter weekend
evidence of my chocolate eating over
Easter yes so that is what is in the
main section of my bag that is not empty
the only last thing to show you is what
is in the zippy pocket I already got out
the plans charger that was in that and
then it looks like we just have a few
hair bubbles I think that's literally
all we have in here two more blonde hair
bubbles and then I have two of these
kind of magic hair bubbles you know the
ones that you are in the gym that don't
crease your hair so I've got two of
those and then a brown hair bubble as
well this has got a metal bit in it
though
don't like the metal because I find it
makes them not so elasticy and it can
break and it's really harsh on the hair
so yeah that's it as I told you not
actually that exciting but just a very
honest what's in my handbag the bag is
now empty you can kind of see inside so
you've got this nice pink lining we've
got a pocket here with no zip and then
as if you poke it down there at the back
there's something else just fall out oh
yeah the you Ted Baker button just fell
out so put that back in the bag the only
other thing is this back pocket now I
don't often use this I'm sure this oh
there is something in here okay Oh some
clothing tags okay so this is a blow dry
kind of loyalty card from O'Sullivan's
in London fridge and 20% on for your
next discount to O'Sullivan's and then I
have a Karen Millen clothes tag because
I was wearing this really nice top the
other day and I kind of noticed that my
dad was Dylan so I pulled the tag off
and that is also in the back of my bag I
think that's it yes that's it my bag is
now completely empty so yeah that is
what I carry around on everyday basis
I'm probably not going to put the dog
stuff back in and I'm gonna empty a lot
of my makeup bag back into our makeup
drawers because as I said I don't
normally carry that much makeup around
me on everyday basis so with my bag
empty that is the end of this video I
