joining me for today's video I can
barely even believe that I'm filming
this because it still just feels so
surreal but if you've been following me
on snapchat or anything you might
already know this but tomorrow I'm
flying it to Costa Rica for my first
mission as a Sun ambassador for pissed
win and yeah I can't I still can't
believe it it's just so crazy I'm so
excited
and yeah Costa Rica so that's an 11 hour
flight
so today I've been super busy putting
together my hand luggage I carry on my
in-flight beauty kit and I thought I
would share with you today what's in my
carry-on maybe you have a long-haul
flight coming up and you want to be nosy
and see what I'm taking maybe you might
forgotten some bits and bobs and you
might want to put some these bits in to
UM oh maybe you just want to watch
anyway I'm gonna have a little bit of
help throughout this video little D
money is um lurking oh I'm gonna miss
him so much I love him he loves this new
lipstick it's one of the new tomforde
ones which I love so I'm gonna put
Dexter down so I take two bags with me
on SuperDuper long haul flights the
first of which is actually a suitcase
and this is a white one which had quite
some time the brand is revolution and
this is a white double kind of sided one
with a zippy pocket on one side and an
open area on the other this I have taken
with me I took it recently with me to
Germany and I put all of my stuff in
here so it's really good for short
journeys as well so for example if I
don't want to put something and hold
I'll put all of my bits and bobs in this
which is great it fits obviously in the
overhead compartment but it's really
good before putting in the bulkier
things I don't need for the entire
journey if that makes sense
and the other bag that I take with me
because it's just too much hassle to
keep going in and out of that one is
this which is my redly backpack I think
it's the Neil Street rucksack and you
might recognize this from my what's in
my handbag video but I keep completely
different things in this when I'm
traveling I think a backpack is really
useful because you don't reeling a
suitcase
and carrying a shoulder bag the way that
it's the backpack you can just fling it
on and forget about it but I'll keep all
my liquids and so I don't have to open
my suitcase when I go through the
security I'll keep my passport my purse
and you're going to see all that anyway
so let's start with the things that are
in my biggest suitcase in no particular
order the first thing that's in there is
my laptop and I've got the MacBook Pro
in this cool kind of pink case I think I
just got this case from Amazon but it's
really good well all the time I keep the
case on but particularly good for
traveling because it just protects it a
little bit and I also take with me
my hard drive and this is a Samsung hard
drive and I keep all my video files on
my photos on it because when I'm on a
plane for 11 hours I can't ever bear to
sit still and be unproductive so the
thought of being on a plane for 11 hours
not being productive kills me so I will
be video editing and photo editing
throughout the flight so these two are
the first things in my big bag what I'll
also keep in my large bag is actually a
change of clothes / hot destination
outfit because say the worst was to
happen and my main suitcase got lost I
would just hate to have to be in my
traveling clothes for the time it took
me to sort things out so I haven't
actually taken the type of this yet it's
new but I've chosen this kind of beachy
shirt dress which I thought be really
good for when I arrived in Costa Rica
because it's quite conservative you're
not showing your shoulders or think
you're just about showing your knees but
you know they're not that bad over there
and but yeah this is super light lovely
light material folds up to practically
nothing so I've got this with me
just in case anything happens I'm sure
I'm sure it won't but you know it's
always good to be safe and also
sometimes you don't want to wait and
unpaid loggers to get you in the room
when I used to go to Maldives it's so
hot when you land when you're in the
seaplane Airport you just want to get
changed straight away so these will be
really handy and convenient if I do want
to get changed when I land also along
the same lines I also like to take a
bikini or swimming costume with
this came from a website called I think
it was my apartment I'm not sure but
it's a really cute swimsuit so I'm
packing that in my carry-on as well
again for the same reasons or so my
suitcase gets delayed and I'm going to
pull something that's why--that's in
there not technically in my suitcase but
also in my hand luggage I'll take a hat
because perhaps don't particularly fold
very well and so I'll normally just kind
of wear a hat when I am traveling
because it's much easier to wear it than
it is to pack it so I've got this one
which i think is from accessorized a
little while ago I'm not sure I did get
quite some time ago I'm pretty sure it
was accessorized yeah don't it works on
you're going to go over here I don't
need any help
also my large suitcase I have this which
is a blanket / pillow so as you can see
right now it's all zipped up and it
connect as a pillow but what I normally
do is unzip it and pull out this kind of
lovely super soft fleecy blanket and
it's really huge really long so you can
cover your feet and still get really
smuggled up and I'm not the biggest fan
of aeroplanes blankets so for me this is
really nice because I've washed it at
home it smells like home and yeah I can
just get really snuggled up without
having to do it with one of the outcome
like it's on similar kind of lines I
also have one of these I'm not sure the
exact name they just call like a neck
pillow or something and but this is
really nice and soft as well it's kind
of velvety on one side and of course it
helps you just kind of get more
comfortable when you're trying to fall
asleep maybe I'm watching film and I
just think I might start dozing off I'll
put that on a few more comfort related
things in my large bag firstly I have
this colorful pashmina this again is a
really really big one I think I got this
from a whistles sale a couple of years
ago but I find pashmina so good when
it's a little bit chilly but you don't
really want to put on too many more
layers or maybe it's like smelly those
fumes or something you can speed it in
and it normally has your perfume smell
in it which is really good again this
just folds down to something absolutely
minute
skills so I don't begrudge the space
that this takes up and I always take a
little passionate with me but I also
have this cashmere cardigan because when
it does get a little bit chilly
sometimes it go a bit overboard on the
air-conditioning all these long-haul
flights and something like this again it
goes down to being super tiny but it
just provides so much warmth and comfort
so this is an old cashmere jumper from
Rhys it looks quite chic as well it's
just plain grey mal and another travel
essential and the final kind of comfort
thing is a pair of super fluffy socks I
will always take my shoes off it seems
like on the airplane so for long-haul
flights are going to want to go to the
bathroom and you're maybe gonna want to
go for a little stroll if your legs are
cramping up like mine usually do so
putting on a really thick pair of socks
kind of like shoes but without the
uncomfort of also in my larger bag is a
pair of sunglasses because when you get
out it's going to be sunny hopefully so
it's really nice if you're going to
stick on a pair of sunglasses and these
are in a nice thin pouch they are Ray
Bans and not sure the name of this style
but it's kind of like the retro not club
master I'm not sure but I really like
these I think they're quite a nice style
they can go on my head and they don't
have the bubbly bits which ruin your
hairstyle so I'll be popping those in
ready for arrival and in the main
suitcase I'll also have the bulk of my
beauty kit but not the liquids so the
liquids I have separated out into a
plastic bag and put in my rucksack so
that I can take them out for security
but the non liquid things I keep in here
are my silk I mask which is inside here
this is not the eye mask and this
beautiful one from Olivia at Thornhill
which I was really kind of sent by Estee
Lauder recently and when I've on an eye
mask it sends me to sleep really really
quickly and it's also kind of a way of
saying to the air hostesses I'm going to
sleep now don't disturb me also in here
is a large mirror this one is by Paul
and Joe I got this off a sauce and it's
a really really huge mirror so great for
taking off makeup doing your info beauty
routine and putting on a makeup again
when you land
sorry if the lighting or the setup has
suddenly change
I just had to change my memory card
because card full but let's carry on so
the next non liquid in my beauty bag is
a packet of tissues you never know what
you might need tissues for whether it's
removing makeup wiping something up or
blowing your nose I am at the tail end
of a cold so yeah definitely need some
tissues in there and then the rest of
the bits and bobs in here are my beauty
products and I have also actually filmed
or about to film and in-flight beauty
routine so everything that I do to
pamper my skin and make sure that I'm
looking and feeling lovely and fresh
when I get off the plane so that will be
coming your way on Sunday but that's the
rest of things which in my makeup bag
which is this ginormous Charlotte
Tilbury Norman Parkinson incredible huge
makeup bag so then we move on to my
smaller bag and this is the Radley
backpack which I will have on my back
which is the things that I need a little
bit more excessively does that make
sense I don't know when I'm in the
airport so of course the first thing
that I've got in this bag is my passport
you cannot travel without it so
definitely a trouble essential and I've
also got this case which I need to put
on it which says beach pounds and I
absolutely love this I'm afraid I don't
know where it's from us given this as a
gift by Bobby Brown very kindly
so not actual Bobby Brown but yeah you
know what I mean so my passport is the
first thing that's in there
then of course we have my phone I
obviously have this I don't go anywhere
without my phone I will put it on to
airplane mode so I can just listen to my
Spotify playlist and iTunes if I
actually get around to putting some new
songs on there and the case I have on
this to protect it is kind of I'd say
this is a little bit of a 20s style case
which is from a company called case 2phi
and yeah that's all I have to say about
that then also in my rucksack I have my
purse this is a Kate Spade purse which I
picked up from a sample sale ages ago
it's the same person I talked about in
my what's in my handbag videos the work
goes too much detail the only thing
that's different about it this time is
that I also have a few US dollars which
I believe is except
in Costa Rica then I have my iPad in its
case this case is kind of like a dupe
for the Apple ones I think I paid about
six pounds for it from Amazon but it
looks like the Apple ones and protects
it and on my iPad I will have downloaded
a few series from BBC iPlayer and also a
few issues of Grazia magazine I've got a
subscription where you can get them on
the iPad so instead of kind loads
magazines with me I will download a few
issues to flip through on the plane also
randomly I have one of these which is a
gorilla stand for your camera and to go
with that I have a new camera this is my
new vlogging camera so canon g7x I heard
really really good things about this I
love my Olympus still to absolute death
and it's actually getting fixed at the
moment and when I was in Germany when
the requirements for my job as I had to
do a vlog so I know it might seem a
little bit frivolous but I went out and
bought this camera and it's really good
for vlogging the lighting it's actually
best in the Olympus but photos I prefer
the Olympus but ramble aside I have got
this and a gorilla tripod which is
basically a tripod that does weird
shapes you can cling it on to anywhere
because I'm actually planning on filming
part of my in flight PC routine while on
the planes I thought I've been kind of
like cling this onto part of the seat in
front of me and attach my camera ready
to film so that's why I randomly have a
gorilla tripod in my hand luggage also
in here oh I didn't know this was in
here but might leave it it's one of
those kind of rose quartz cooling I
don't really know what it's called but
you put your eye cream on with it and
apparently Mexico into your skin better
I might take this out don't know it just
was in the bottom of this bag then I
have my own stuck to my hairbrush I have
my Apple headphones these I love for
when I'm going to be falling asleep with
my music in or falling asleep to a film
but if I'm just listening to music or
watching a film and I'm very much awake
then I'll put these on now it might seem
a little bit crazy to take two pairs but
when you're on a plane for 11 hours
you're pretty going to want to have
earphones or headphones on for
quite a lot of the trip and these um
gosh they're very sound canceling I
can't even hear myself and these are my
friends are the rose gold ones I've had
these for couple years now mom got them
for me last Christmas so yeah I've had
them over here yeah and I really love
them but they do make your ears ache
just a little bit when you've had them
on for several hours so that's why I
take two pairs of earphones so we have
also my bag of liquids which as I said
I'm not going to go through because it's
all going to be in my in-flight beauty
routine video but one thing I didn't
mention in that video which I also have
is a mini perfume this is pomegranate
Noir and cologne by Joe Malone isn't a
beautiful tiny bottle and this is 30
mils so it's allowed or fit in my bag
you're allowed to fit as much liquid as
you can basically in these bags and I
love it there's nothing better than
getting off the plane and smelling nice
and fresh also got my toothbrush
although I'm probably going to put that
in this one because I don't need it that
excessively in my bag I have a hairbrush
this is actually one which came in one
of those first-class travel bags I've
never flown first class before but
Charlie's dad does quite regularly when
he flies with work and the little goodie
bags to give you in first class come
with these amazing portable hair brushes
and it's got a thick side and a comb and
then folds together which is just
absolutely perfect and really good for
traveling and that's actually everything
that I have in this bag but a few things
which I haven't mentioned are things
which I'll buy in the airport so I'll
buy a bottle of water once I'm through
security because although they give you
water for free on the plane I like to
just have one there and be able to sip
it whenever I want without having a cup
which is just dangerous when I have my
laptop around so buy a bottle of water a
bag of sweets and specifically a bag of
sweets which I can suck because when you
suck a sweet up in the air its doctor
ears from poppin which might be an old
wives tale but I believe it and I like
sweets so I'll get those and I'll also
get a maybe a glamour or a Cosmo
magazine the smaller half sizes because
they're really really handy so that's
everything that I take with me carry-on
wise when I'm going on holiday on a
long-haul flight in particular as I said
also filming an in-flight beauty routine
video which i think is going
be really good fun and I do love to
pamper myself when I go myself there's
only one I do love to pamper myself when
I go on long-haul flights because it's
such a long period of time just to be
sitting there so I do a full on
in-flight facials so definitely check
out that video which if all goes to plan
will be up on Sunday when I'm in Costa
Rica and on that note make sure you are
following me on snapchat Instagram and
Twitter because I'm going to be doing
some major holidays span and you're
going to want to see it because that's
custom Rico it's so crazy I can't
believe I'm going so I'm going to head
off now and not to the airport just off
this video so I hope you guys enjoyed
this do give it a thumbs up if you did
subscribe if you're new and if you are
going on a journey then I hope you have
to say flights and a super trip and I'll
see you my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
