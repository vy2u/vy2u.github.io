joining me for today's video which is
another of my longest videos I was
actually reading through my comments
when I was trying to decide what video
to film next and I thought I'm gonna see
what you guys have been asking for and
there were quite a few comments recently
asking for and updated what's in my hand
my video so that is what we are going to
do today I am I've been using this hand
bag for about six weeks now I'm going to
say and it is a lovely big brown handbag
from Karen Millen and I was actually
really kindly sent this bag I think it's
around 120 pounds I'm not under control
but I will leave the information and a
link this bag down in the description
box below but it is from Karen Millen
it's a beautiful brown leather handbag a
really wearable Brown it just goes with
everything which is why I love it so
much it goes with all of my outfits and
it's a beautiful all year round bag guys
say it's spring summer autumn winter
just stunning these handles also long
enough to loop over my shoulder but I
can also kind of hang it from my arm
although I do tend to fill it up quite a
lot so doesn't hang on my arm very very
often but the only thing I've taken out
of this bag before I've shown you on
before I show you what's inside it's my
laptop because I couldn't actually pick
it up I've gotten back Book Pro and it's
fairly heavy I'm actually in the market
to get one of new lovely airs I can't
decide whether to get Rose cold or cold
though but when I have that it'll be a
lot lot lighter so yeah I took this bag
around with me yesterday and I was
working so I had my laptop with me but
other than that I've not really rummaged
through it so I thought I'd do that with
you guys these videos always tend to be
like a handbag clear out for me as well
so don't go through my bag very often so
I'm just gonna start pulling stuff out
and showing you guys alrighty so first
thing is this and it's a little coin
purse slash card holder from Coach this
was actually a free gift with a
fragrance it's got a keychain on it
which I should probably attach my house
keys to I'm hoping my house keys are
going to be any excellent seen in a few
days and it's got a zit on the top I
keep some coins in there because my
person only doesn't really have room for
coins
do that later on I do have a 20 pound
note folded up in there just in case and
then I've got my ID and my driving and
yeah my ID is my driving license got my
ID and my America Express card
my bad card which I use for most things
I tend to use my Amex over my NatWest
debit card firstly because I really
don't like NatWest after I do if you saw
me like ranting on Twitter awhile ago
basically my cards got stolen and that
Wes were really shitty about it so I've
not been using mine now Wes card that
much I feel like my customer loyalty has
gone plus I've got the BA Amex so I do
get a biast points the more I spend on
it so it's contactless I use on the bus
I use on the tube I use it for
everything and they are all in this
beautiful black leather coach card
holder so really really handy thing and
that was just floating around on the top
next I have my brolly yesterday and
today actually although it's sunny right
now have been just gross and horrible
and rainy it's actually dripping still
now this was just sodden yesterday it's
literally I could squeeze it yeah look
and water's coming off it so gross but
as you can see this I need to put it
down it's really really leaking all over
me this is an umbrella
it's from Topshop and the handle is a
duck so yes I love this prolly and it's
wet sunscreen check it over there for
now next thing to pull out is my purse
and you may recognize this from my u.s.
beauty haul I picked this up from Tory
Burch on Rodeo Drive and I filmed the
unboxing and everything in my u.s. horse
I'll leave that link down below in case
you wanted to catch up on that one but
it's a beautiful light pink color and
it's got a wrist strap which is actually
really handy mainly for security reasons
if I'm like crossing the road at home
and I just want to go and get some milk
or something I will always leave it
around my wrist so you drop it and I do
it on the edge of Brixton so you know
what I mean and if you look inside its
got it's actually a very annoying design
so straight away I know though needs
like clear out these coins and put them
in my coin purse because there's no
zippy section so you've got this big
section here for
it's gift cards I've got all that kind
of stuff here and also a couple of
slopped here which I also use for
receipts I've got my NUS card a
Starbucks discount card or not discount
card gift card about three pounds left
on it and then my NatWest card just in
case anyway doesn't accept an X so I've
actually really reduced what was in my
purse you may remember from my previous
what's in my bag videos I had really
bulky Kate Spade purse which just
started to look a little bit battered
and when I transferred I just really
really cut down what has kind around it
makes my purse so heavy so that's also
in there then I have my makeup bag and
this is always a fun bit to look through
so the makeup bag itself is actually
very dirty you could probably do with
going in the washing machine and it's
from chordally I think this was again
the free free gift with purchase or
something and it says I feel great on it
because obviously grapes are called use
main ingredients and inside I've just
got like my daily beauty bits so I
whizzed through them really really
quickly first thing is this L'Occitane
hand cream and it's the roses RN hand
and nail cream I just love this it's so
tiny really really handy tapping a
handbag it's very moisturizing it sinks
in really quickly and it smells great
too
then I have the Anastasia Beverly Hills
liquid lipstick in the shade dominatrix
one on although I'm not going to leave
that to the side to put back in my
makeup jobs I don't need it in my in my
hand my makeup bag lip balm is always
really handy to carry around with you
this is the super lips lip hero from
Gillan just a really lovely one it's a
very very nourishing lip balm but it
sinks in quite quickly so you don't have
that like sticky feeling all day so
perfect for in the handbag then I have
my fan brush this needs a wash so I'm
going to leave it out to wash it from
zoeva and I really like applying an
additional powder during the day using a
fan brush because it really doesn't cake
we'll make up then I also have to go
without my Laura Mercier loose finishing
powder because I have this little sample
pot which is so tiny perfect size for
the handbag this is literally oops this
is called their translucent loose
setting powder great for topping up
during the day and it really does not
leave your skin looking cakey or looking
like you've completely mattified your
whole complexions that's a really good
one and perfect to apply with the zoeva
brush if the oil situation is not quite
so dramatic
I'll use my Tarte blotting papers these
are again there could be not so slick
oil absorbing blotting papers got these
also in the US same Hall as the purse
and when these run out are probably just
buy cheap boots and brand ones because I
want to see think there's no difference
between expensive blotting papers and
cheap ones but very handy if like me
have oily skin these are such a savior
so easy to use although you do end up
with gross used blotting papers
everywhere then I've got the Charlotte
Tilbury Dolce Vita no sophisticate
luxury eyeshadow palette this has got
four very wearable shades inside it and
to be honest it's a smallest eyeshadow
palette that I own so really good one to
keep in the handbag I don't always have
it my handbags I tend not to top up my
eye makeup during the day but recently
I've done a few things like facials or
I've been in town from breakfast right
until dinner and I've known that when I
get to the dinner place or just before
I'm going to want to talk about my
makeup so I've been carrying that around
with me and it's got a mirror in the lid
so very very useful okay super exciting
we have two different types of eye drops
if you saw my pharmacy haul video at the
end of last week you'll have heard me
talking about eyedrops these are the
lubra still eyedrops they are pretty
much single-use I'm going to check this
away now you flip the cap off you get
think you get about 50 in a box and
they're very very hydrating so if you
suffer from dry eyes these are great I
also picked up the objects I revived
brightening drops because my eyes been
really red recently and I just wanted to
give them a bit of a shine but I find
the Assisting a little bit
I think you have to check them out after
28 days yeah you do and which is what's
great about Luba still because our
single use and you can just open up a
new sachet when you want to try some new
ones so two very glamorous items in my
makeup bag what is next we have the
Bobbi Brown creamy concealer just so
handy for on-the-go top-ups it is very
very creamy so it's perfect for applying
of your foundation blends really easily
got a little mirror in there too
Tom Ford lipstick in shade first time
this is one of my favorite lipsticks of
all time but I think I'm actually going
to take it out the handbag because it's
very big it's quite a large one to carry
around with you and I have got some
other lip products in there coming up so
I'm going to leave that one in my
bedroom I've got another one from Bobby
Brown another concealer actually this is
their retouching wand it's really good
for underneath the eyes or for
highlighting so it's a little bit
lighter really like the application of
this one - it's just a twist bottom and
then sponge so you can blend it in
straightaway perfect for brightening and
concealing on the go now file this is
just really handy tiny nail file you
know what they do so I'm not going to
crumble about that mini perfume
I always put perfume testers in my
handbag because full-size perfumes are
heavy so testers are great I have a
gallon bronzer this is the Terracotta
Four Seasons and it looks like this so
you've got the four different shades big
mirror in the lid again it's very small
and compact so great for on-the-go
that's another one that I don't carry
around in me everyday but it's because I
did have those breakfast to dinner days
recently that I have all this stuff in
here I've got a new sticks in the shade
and ice and these I picked up from look
fantastic they have such a great
selection of new Stix products there
this is a beautiful shade again super
easy to apply on the go Caryn's lip balm
I love a lip balm and a tube like this
or in the bullet rather and this one is
great if you having no makeup days so if
you just want to have a very subtle tint
on the lips this one's perfect really
lightweight as well so great for handbag
another flower into lip balm this one's
about to run out so I'm just kind of
using it until it dies it's the instant
light lip balm Perfector and I love it
beautiful shade it's actually got clear
nail varnish spilt and dried all over it
so it looks a little
Menke got a brow pencil which I don't
need because obviously brows have been
micro bladed and I know if I do say so
myself looking amazing I'm so pleased
with them so don't we need this I'm
going to put that in my router oh yes I
have a browser how tragic these cotton
buds are in there from when my brows
were recently done and I was having to
apply coconut oil to them so I can check
those out I also owe my spoolie has got
the top of my eye drops lid on it can
you see that victory City so that can
get the bin and the reason why I've got
a spoolie is actually from when I was
wearing Nouveau lashes the individual
lashes and sometimes if you get hot at
all like in the run of the day you might
want to comb through them so that's why
I had the spoolie
I'm not wearing you the lashes anymore
don't we have a use for this so you're
going to throw that away
this is being a really good handbag
detox process this I love this is the
Kevin Kwan flesh tone lip pencil and
I've got a mini version it goes with
every single lipstick that I own you
guys know how much I love this kind of
pinky shade so it just goes with
everything so perfect one for a handbag
another lip liner pretty much the same
shade a little bit softer less
long-lasting and bigger so needs to get
swapped out is the Urban Decay 24/7 lip
liner in the shade liar I love the line
lip color I have it like three different
formulas so this just goes perfectly
with those last few pieces I promise
another perfume this is clean reserved
absolutely love that scent Kat Von D eye
liner really intense black so great for
applying over eyeshadow or just on the
go i shadow brush this is the zoeva 231
luxe petit crease the aforementioned
Urban Decay liar lipstick oh no this is
the shade naked either way it goes
really well with the liar and lip liner
beautiful shade I wear this for most
days absolutely love it then I've got a
sample size of the NARS audacious
mascara which is fabulous for layering
so great to have your handbag because
it's really good at separating the
lashes even if you've got mascara on
then I have just got three more mini
perfumes I've got I know this with Arden
a
cream all over miracle oil okay that's
random but quite handy to have in there
just in case another clean reserve and
another clean reserve because they're
all really good for layering and then at
the bottom I have two more spool ease so
they can go in the bin
oh and also this was in that energy
boosting on-the-go mist find me on very
very random but I guess if I'm ever
stressed or having a busy day of
meetings I could just spritz the air
around me of this and I'll be ready to
go again so random alrighty
makeup bag done that's probably the
longest hurdle out away let's get back
to seeing what's in my handbag I'm going
to go actually to one of the inside
pockets now so it's got a smaller one
and a larger one and this has just got
little loads of random crap in there so
let's see and we've got a London to
Nottingham train ticket that's all the
same journey that's when I did some
filming with VT Liberata so they can go
in the min this is pollen Street social
club room ticket
I did get my stuff back so don't know
why I still have a ticket that's random
but I went to pond street social while
she was little social which is a Jason
Afton restaurant with bourgeois couple
of days ago for fabulous dinners that's
why that's in there then I've got a Miss
Selfridge receipt from my oxford street
hall which you guys saw and also the top
trip receipt and I really enjoyed that
video and I really was very happy and I
was reading the comments that look like
you guys enjoyed it as well so hope you
enjoyed that kind of live haul 55 P and
oops
fifty P and and a hair grip these just
turn up everywhere very handy though so
I put that so I'm going to put it in the
makeup bag because at least then I might
go to find it when I actually need it
and that is everything that was in that
pocket then umm inside the bag you can
see a bit more clearly now there are
these sections here big section on one
side big section on the other side and
then section in the middle and to zippy
sections I don't think I have anything
in this bit but I will rummage through
just in case so I've got some orbit
spinning chewing gum really really handy
although I do have to take my brace out
to chew gum so
a little bit more challenging than it
should be my Paul and Joe Mira this is
just the most handy thing in the world
because it's so flat so lightweight and
a massive mirror so that comes in handy
so often I think I got it from ASOS I'll
leave it linked down below fine
dicks it's the best yes 20 pounds of
it's actually the best 20 pounds I ever
spent so happy then I have my notebook
I've recently a meetings have started
taking more notes because I find that
when I have a full day of meetings
sometimes important things I need to
follow up on just go straight over my
head so this notebook I got from the
rimmel trip to Mykonos they gave us all
these little notebooks in our and on
presentation day to take notes says
squad car Sonics the whole concept of
the numeral collection is around like
your squad and then I've got this kekeke
a pen very conveniently in the elastic
bit so inside here I've just got kind of
notes like to-do lists notes from
meetings so yeah really really handy to
have in a handbag it's quite light and
smaller as well then I've got some hair
bubbles these are from a brand called
Kitsch and they are these very elastic
kind of flat hair ties I actually don't
know why I have them in their cardboard
still but either way handy to have some
hair bubbles in your handbag you may
recognize this from my Primark haul it's
that jewel ended charging cable it's
already come in so handy come in it so
you've got the micro USB and the iPhone
plugs into the USB and my charging block
is actually charging at the moment but I
have got a got one from Amazon I'll
leave a link down below it's so handy
for those days and I'm out the house all
gay tangle teezer handbag essential
especially if they have the shield on
the back this one is really dirty and
need to clean out but it's the Lulu
Guinness design with a kind of lipstick
print on it
I think it's limited edition I think you
can get them from look fantastic again
links down below and but I use this
multiple times a day so handy and great
for detangling having said what I said
before about having the mini perfumes I
do actually also have a germ alone peony
and blush suede in here this is of
course a mini size this is just 13
150 ml 30 ml and so it doesn't take up
too much room but this is another one
that I'm going to leave on side I puts
in my handbag because I knew I had
dinner and I wanted to smell amazing
I've forgotten about the minis so this
is going to stay on my dressing table
now vlogging camera I've got my canon
g7x and i do mix around between the
olympus and the canon but i've been
using this a lot more recently cuz it's
just so tiny and much more light and
portable than the olympus pen bronzing
brush because it's too big for my makeup
bag so that just floats around in the
bottom and earphones which are always a
tangled mess these actually were in my
goodie bag from the light and free
morning raves so random but yeah they're
really good in-ear earphones perfect for
when i edit on the go if i have my
laptop with me it's always handy to have
my earphones don't usually listen to
that much music I haven't updated my
Spotify in a while and oh yeah always
handy to have had friends with you cool
house keys I'm so glad I found these so
I have my front door key double lock key
umm bedroom key and why I have a bedroom
key and then this keyring is from
L'Occitane this one is from Marc Jacobs
Daisy all for Mike bloggers events they
just randomly gave Canaries and my gym
zappy let me in card which is Soho gym
on Kuppam High Street I have another
cable for my charger and this is an
Amazon basics one nice and tiny
so really convenient but I don't need
that many in here I actually have
another one this one I think we got this
yeah Marina del Rey so we got this on
our first day in check America this is a
handy one because you can stretch it and
then you can stretch it back to being
really small and it's got the old-school
iPhone one of the new iPhone one and the
mini USB so that's a handy thing to have
if you're traveling I've got the show
premiered dry shampoo so show it's
tomorrow Eccleston's hair brand i love
this dry shampoo i think it's nearly
gone well i cannot cannot tell you how
many times I've used this though so
handy especially I keep mentioning it
but those days when you're in town all
day just need a judge the end of the day
this smells amazing and works really
well it's beautiful
look its packaging is done
and last in this big section is another
hand cream this is from Clarins and it's
their fig leaf scented hand and nail
cream this is just such a beautiful
scent I love how this smells love how
this feels
and to be honest if I only use the
L'Occitane one in my makeup bag it would
be gone by now so this one is like my
main hand cream I always rotate this and
use this a lot I probably reach this
every single day share it around whoever
I'm with always gets them as well and
it's just a really really beautiful one
so then we have the Zippy compartments I
don't think I have anything in them
nothing in that one
middle section I just have a drumstick
wrapper that's the goop and then the
second zip apartment nothing in there
either I don't tend to put things in
there because I probably would never
find them again oh I think that's all
the exciting stuff over so I've just
found 5p then I have a pair of socks
this is really gross I'm sorry they are
because I was wearing boots the other
day and then I went to the gym I put
trainers on and wore my trainers home so
there you just need to go in the wash
and then finally last but not least oh
there's nothing embarrassing in here
this is where I would put tampons and
stuff the Zippy compartment
looks like I'm safe I haven't to go
through it so I'm just going to grab it
all out in one handful let's see so this
here is a Monica vinegar I discovered
the other day that it is pronounced
Monica vinegar not Pineda like I
normally say and that's coming from
someone who works in a head office so if
you wondered it's Monica vinegar so this
is a jewelry pouch and I actually use it
to keep my memory cards in so in here
there are some memory cards and I
I'm in there because I was editing on
the go yesterday and this is just a
really good way of just knowing where
they all are so memory card pouch lip
liner and a lip stick this lip liner is
from kaplan md beverly hills and it's a
really beautiful very flattering shade
again that kind of brownish shade that I
wear all the time
I think I grabbed this one and put it in
my handbag because I was wearing it
specifically one day why is it doesn't
need to be in there anymore so that can
go back in my cupboard and this is the
Topshop everything stick it's called and
everything sticks you can use it on your
eyes if you want to on your cheeks and
as a lip balm but I only use it on the
lips and it's a beautiful shade brownie
pink almost a little bit orange II
terracotta II absolutely love it very
nourishing and moisturizing as well so
very comfortable to wear so I'm going to
put that in the handbag makeup bag and
lastly this is so random like seriously
the most random thing ever I have a load
of sachets of Sarah Chapman's SOS
stickers I think these are spot stickers
and looks like you only get one in each
sachet so quite extravagant I must have
been given them at like a counter or
something
I've got no clue but they're in there
this is a very honest what's in my
handbag so by the looks of it that is
absolutely everything there's a weird
pocket here it's probably for your
Oyster Card or something it's very very
slim can you see that so like this bit
here yeah there's nothing in there I can
probably keep my question card in there
if I wanted to and so the bag is now
empty you can see the design a bit
better now I can hold it up a bit more
easily there's these pleats here where
these if your pockets connect to nice
thick handles a really lovely soft
leather so really really great handbag
and it feels lovely in light now put
very things out of it so I've had a
really good handbag detox as a lot of
things in here which can now get chucked
out a lot of things to go back in so I
hope you guys enjoyed looking through my
handbag with me I just find this concept
so strange that we love looking through
what's a ninja scumbags I'm guilty too
