you probably have noticed I'm in a very
different surrounding today I'm actually
filming this video in the reception area
of the beautiful epstein Hotel where I'm
currently stay in Catalonia and I cannot
wait Sherlock this trip with you guys so
that's coming in a few days today I
thought I would share with you my what's
in my iPhone video I've actually had a
few requests to do a video like this
recently as well as how I edit my
Instagram videos so I thought I would
put that together for you today starting
off with the phone I have an iPhone 6
plus it's a really big phone a lot of
people ask how I get along with it with
the size but I actually don't find it
too bad because it's always in the
handbag so it doesn't really bother me
that it's quite big and I personally
like to edit my photos on the big screen
and watch videos and I find it really
really handy but the case I often get
asked about is from a brand called case
defy and I will leave a link to that
down below so without further ado let me
show you what is on my iPhone okay so
here's my phone and my lock screen is
this really silly picture of Dexter I
think you look so cute in this photo and
it makes me smile all the time so i
unlock my phone and you'll notice I have
this little button here and that's
because my middle button keeps breaking
it's so annoying but by having this I
can do screenshots and that kind of
thing without using this button at the
moment it's okay
but sometimes it breaks so that's why I
have that there so this is my main
screen my background is these beautiful
flowers and I found this I think I just
found this on Google I probably
literally know actually that's a lie I
took this photo and I instagrammed it a
little while ago it's some flowers near
my house so I probably have everything
that you'd expect to see here on my main
page I guess I'll just start from the
top row and work my way down so first of
all I have my calendar this is my entire
life I keep everything in here as you
can see today just says Kefalonia
because I'm filming this in Catalonia
annoyingly it's a little bit cloudy
today so I decided to film this video
indoors for you guys but yeah I
literally just keep like all my meetings
in here you can see this is like a
random day of meetings and yeah it's
quite organized I guess I even left
myself a note yesterday or the day
before to give Charlie my passport
because I just knew that if I didn't set
myself an alarm that I would forget it
so my calendar is really really
important and I try and keep that really
organized next I have my photos I have
my camera roll which actually I have
recently deleted a load of things
because my memory is so low I always
screenshot funny things like this is
from an Instagram account called dogs
being basic and I just thought this was
hilarious so I took a photo of that so
yeah I just have my camera roll which is
always overflowing favorites which I
sometimes use when I'm instagramming
photos selfies I don't actually take
that many selfies these are for my brace
and then I'm getting done videos
screenshots I also have an album for
Dexter which is probably my favorite
album it shows all of the photos that I
take of him I add to this album all the
time and this is actually the very first
photo that we got of him when the
breeder was showing us which puppy was
ours so these are ones that we didn't
take but it's really nice and that was
the day that we picked him up so it's
really nice to have this album of photos
of my little boy and so yeah that's
pretty much just my camera roll and then
if we go to the next thing
videos I actually don't think I have
much on there don't really watch too
many videos on my phone and then we have
utilities which I guess is quite boring
just the things I don't really use that
much I do use the clock section I set
myself alarms quite a lot I don't have
any set a moment because I'm away
although you can see how do regularly
have like early start alarms reminders I
don't normally use app store and really
bad at keeping my apps up-to-date but
who really cares and this is actually a
book by Scott this is actually a really
useful app it's called if and I don't
know why all bloggers don't you
because it's such a savior you basically
create recipes so one of my favorite
ones is if I do an Instagram post this
is obviously going through the beginning
because I haven't opened it in a while
but I have got it all set up but
basically when I do an Instagram post it
automatically tweets my photo instead of
that silly link so if you're a blogger
or anyone that just wants their
Instagram photos to go onto their
Twitter then I highly recommend
downloading this app and setting it all
up and you don't need to do it ever
again once you've created that like
recipe then it does it automatically so
that's really really handy my next
folder is called fashion and I have a
few kind of shopping apps in here to be
honest I don't really use these vogue
ones I haven't checked them in ages so
I'm delete them while I'm thinking about
it I probably using up valuable phone
memory the last two apps that are in
here are two shopping apps these are the
only two shopping apps that I use the
first one is morsy and I've been using
this app for absolutely ages I think
every fashion astir should have this on
their phone it's seriously useful I'm
hoping it's going to work because my
Wi-Fi is really really poor at the
moment but basically it has all of your
favorite fashion brands in one place you
can see here like whistles Banana
Republic is a lando which is totally
underrated I absolutely love solando
even hmm like websites that I don't like
their website like I don't really like
shopping oh man great calm I don't know
why but I love shopping on it on here I
think there's like over 150 brands and
what I've done is created a few feeds so
at the moment I'd say I'm kind of in the
market for accessories so you can take
what you're looking for if you just want
to look at dresses and the great thing
is I've already set up a profile with my
sizes so personally I hate it when I go
on a website and left sold out of my
size and I don't want to see a beautiful
dress and get really excited and then
it's gone so what I've done here like on
foot where I've ticked size three so I
only see shoes in my size dresses I've
chosen four and six because I fit both
of those sizes etc etc so then when I go
on to the app and I click on dresses and
I haven't really specified what kind of
dresses so I'll get loads here
again gonna be super slow because of my
wife I am okay so here is my favorites
page here I've been saving a few items
which come payday I'll probably be
treating myself too
I'm I finished using like a few pairs of
sunglasses these are all hired quite
quite high price ones but the great
thing about this app is that it also
sends you sale alerts so say this pair
these are from I think I was shopping on
French Connection
well actually the outlet yes it's from
the out net oh and the great thing is
this will send me an alert when that
they go on sale so that's another thing
that I really love about the app and
also it kind of introduces you to
retailers that you might not have
considered before obviously I love
shopping at places like H&amp;amp;M Topshop
River Island but I never really
considered shopping from the out net and
since using this app I have bought quite
a few things from that so it's really
nice to discover new shops as well okay
so I'm gonna try doing a search again
now so I'm going to do female dresses
obviously and wonder if you can do male
dresses yes you can okay they don't we
don't discuss that fine
so dresses I'm gonna say I want black
brown grey you guys can probably guess
my colour palette and pink of course
white and I don't want to be spending
more than let's say 200 pounds and kind
of looking at dresses for the races for
Ascot though on this part of the app you
can then swipe through all the different
options this has given me 2745 from my
reduced requirements and then you
basically almost like tinder you can
kind of get rid of it that way or save
it that way to your wishlist hopefully
this will work with my really bad Wi-Fi
connection this one I don't actually
think it's gonna be long enough for
Ascot so I'm gonna swipe that way this
is gorgeous not what I want for this
occasion but I do like it I'm gonna add
it to my wishlist don't really like
black long dresses so much and then yeah
my Internet's really rubbish so this is
not gonna be too quick that is so nice
for holiday and it's my wish list yes I
love that
etc etc you get the point and you can
also directly buy them so this has taken
me to what retailer assist
see again not necessarily someone that I
always shop so it's really nice to
discover new options and then when you
do want to go through and make a sale
it's really quick and simple there's
literally like two buttons to click and
they're all hooked up with a propane so
it's really really quick and easy so
absolutely love this app highly
recommend it for shopaholics like me if
you just like love fashion then highly
recommend downloading more see so that's
that and then the next one I have is a
sauce to be honest I don't actually use
this that much I prefer shopping from
the website but I just have it there
because I do love a sauce just gonna put
my phone on airplane mode because of
Wi-Fi is not working anyway and I don't
want to use up all my 3G next up is my
photography folder and I've had a few
questions about how I edit my Instagram
photos and I don't really have a hugely
long process so I just wish through it
really quickly with you the first thing
that I do is open vsco cam vsco cam and
I think all bloggers use this it's so
useful especially if you are like I am
obsessed with the grid and by the grid I
mean like how you the first impression
is how your images sit next to each
other so for me it's quite important
that you don't have too many similar
colors together like I think this photo
is going to go here and then it would
have been to blue sky and sees next to
each other so it's really nice to see
how your photos sit next to each other
on the grid so I always practice an
image in the grid first let's actually
pretend we're going to do this photo
because I actually did quite an
interesting editing process on that
lights so this is what my grid looked
like before
maybe I tested a few different photos
let's say this one that would actually
look quite nice although maybe the red
of Lydia's top and the drinks don't look
too good together a song and it not used
that one and then I took the unedited
version of that photo and I was like
yeah okay my hand is an estimate
positioner so not great
but I really like it so then I look at
the photos and it's really dark so first
of all I'm going to lighten it a little
bit all in vsco cam upping the exposure
a few pieces and then I apply a filter
and
most of my photos have the m5 filter
which gives them and what I like to call
like a rose gold kind of glow to it
sometimes I bring that down a little bit
to make it more subtle that is the
majority of the editing that I do on
vsco cam and then I save it to my camera
roll in the largest file format and I
take it over to facetune which I think I
had to pay about $2.99 for but I highly
recommend it and this is I was obviously
using this photo on it this app when I
edited it this is the final edit and
this is what the photo looked like
before so you can see I've taken away
the yellow and I've brightened it a
little bit and I've added some detail on
my shoes and I'll quickly show you how I
did that
they're taking the original photo which
is this one just with some basic edits
from the SEO pants I'm using the teeth
whitening tool to add some whiteness to
this yellow I'm I don't really like this
together so I just use the teeth
whitening tool to get rid of that it's
really effective and quite
natural-looking I'm just gonna whisk
through it now I'm not going to do it
perfectly and then I also used it on my
jeans to get rid of some of that
highlight and then save it you can also
do like a before and after with this
button here on my shoes
they've got some really nice studs on
them so I'm using the detail tool just
to scribble over it you can also use
this on your eyes to brighten your eyes
really like that one again if i zoom in
you can see before and after and I use
that same tool to make my eyelashes
stand out as well describe low fat
so I've saved those settings and now I'm
going to zoom in to my face and I'm
going to use a smoothing tool just to
kind of smooth out my under-eye bags I
don't really do too much airbrushing but
I mean it's so easy that sometimes it
doesn't really hurt to do a little bit
but normally I just do it under my eyes
because I do get quite bad eye bags and
that's quite lovely
very subtle way of doing it that is like
a mega airbrush option but I don't
really like to do that too much and the
safe is smoothing and that's actually
all I'm gonna do here so then I would
take the image back into vsco cam to
make sure it looks good it needs a bit
more brightening so I'm going to use
after night for that again I think most
bloggers use this I didn't save that
face to one but yeah I would normally
just use the brightness tool take that
up a little bit maybe decrease the
saturation a bit and then once that's
all good I will save it and put it back
into the SEO cam then I have my notes
section there's nothing terribly
exciting in here just things which I
normally copy and paste random things
that people have told me every now and
then I still have the blogger app
although I'm on WordPress now so I'm
actually gonna delete this this has been
quite a good phone cleansing activity I
have Pinterest which to be honest I
haven't really are countries from an
airplane mode I'm really used it that
much on my phone recently I did go
through a mega Pinterest phase I just
haven't had time to do it recently which
is so annoying weather app I find this I
find this fairly reliable actually so
yeah I do use this quite a lot as you
can see Kefalonia not looking too great
today but it's looking fat before the
rest of the time we are here music to be
honest I more listen to Spotify so don't
use that too much lifestyle I have this
find a friend app which don't use what I
used to when I was like stalking charlie
and then I have eBay I mean I don't use
eBay that much either feels which is
quite fun fashion app haven't used a
little while don't really use those too
then I have whatsapp and that's really
like where I speak to most of my friends
that's really useful citymapper
is my savior living in
and highly recommend this if you live in
London because it also tells you like
when the bus is due to arrive you just
type in your final destination and it
will give you every route possible
including walking time bus time taxi
time tactic cost so yeah I really really
liked that last place by putting was
Covent Garden I've got a few places
saved I don't know why that wouldn't say
who don't know where that is and then
I've got my house saved as well actually
that's not my house thank God she can't
stalk me from this but yeah you can save
your home address on there then I've got
Facebook which I do still use mostly for
like personal things Instagram obviously
I use that a lot so that's a very
prominent one on my home page Twitter
you guys know I'm always tweeting so
once again I can't show you because of
airplane mode but yeah I do tweet a lot
so have that they're ready and
accessible seven-minute workout is quite
a good one and I find it really good
when I'm traveling so it's like seven
minutes of circuit exercises which I
really really enjoy doing so I do have
that on my home page blog lovin don't
actually use it that much either
and snapchat you guys hopefully follow
me on snapchat I do love snapping it's
probably my favorite app at the moment
so keep that on my home page so I can
just quickly do a snap whenever for the
moment strikes and then Spotify which is
how I listen to music I have the premium
accounts so I can pretty much download
whatever song I want I have a few
playlists I've got some Kaido Coldplay
all that kind of stuff and if you
download them and you've got the premium
then you don't need Wi-Fi so it's good
from the airplane phone text messages
emails and Safari my emails are like man
life this is amazing that's only two if
it gets over ten when I get really
stresses though it's good to keep it low
podcast is on the next page I've been
enjoying a few recently like girl Austin
City she's done a few like interviews
which I find really entertaining the
only one I've got here is Shazam and I
just find that every now and then maybe
I'm watching a TV advert and I want to
the songs that's quite useful don't
really use the games travel I have uber
I have BA because you can kind of like
keep track of your elbows you can
check-in online now West is my bank
facebook Messenger don't really use as
me and Chinese joint account Barclays
make up movies there's quite a good one
so I bought my credit cards through
compare the meerkats or compare the
market and then you get two-for-one
cinemas
on I think it's Tuesday and Wednesday so
that's quite fun FaceTime I don't use
that often so loss is just there because
we have a so loss at home I don't know
how to use it but Charlie does YouTube
obviously I'm on YouTube so I can like
edit some videos and stuff on there only
things like the description not the
actual video so that's quite handy
invoice to go obviously I am freelance I
do send invoices when I work with brands
of my time so that's the app that I use
to keep track of all my invoices me
invoices my invoices Ryanair they are
such k knobs when it comes to checking
in you have to do it at least two hours
before the flight so by having that
there it kind of reminds me to do it
AccuWeather is good because it tells you
like the real feel temperature so if
it's 22 degrees it might only feel like
17 so it's quite useful to know what the
actual feeling feel is so right now it's
16 but it feels like 15 so quite good to
knows Google Maps I normally use when
I'm in the car so it's better than the
normal map app so I do use that quite a
lot and then social blade is one I
downloaded recently I think Lydia millon
was telling me about this so it's quite
interesting to like track your new likes
and new followers so it's quite
interesting to my compare it day on day
on day yeah it's not gonna work now cuz
my airplane mode that's quite good if
we're interested in that kind of thing
and then a few that I use not quite as
often on the back pages so that's pretty
much it actually this is this is my
iPhone and yeah I hope you guys have
enjoyed this video found it useful and
interesting
I'll see you my next one five</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
