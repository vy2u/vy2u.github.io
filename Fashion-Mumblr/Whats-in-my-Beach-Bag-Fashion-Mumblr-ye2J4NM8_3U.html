welcome back to my Channel today I'm
feeling really happy and excited because
I'm filming a what's in my beach bag
video I have never even done a what's in
my handbag this is something completely
new over here on my channel I thought I
would share this with you because I am
going on holiday next week and I have
already been busy deciding what's going
to be going in my each bag when we go
away we tend to spend the entire day
away from the villa so we'll get a boat
and we'll go to a couple of different
bays but what that means is I have to
have my entire day's stuff with me in my
beach bag so it's pretty heavy pretty
full but it should make for a fun video
so so let's get started with what I'll
be wearing to go down to the boats and
firstly I picked up this absolutely
gorgeous hat from Dorothy Perkins I just
fell in love with the colors and navy
and the orange and I think it's really
really beautiful and chic and kind of
Greek / and Mediterranean any kind of
style I just think it's really really
beautiful and I'm really looking forward
to wearing this I think it'll look
really chic in my Instagram pictures and
its really colorful and yeah I love this
I will also be wearing this caftan which
I picked up from Ted Baker it's got a
really beautiful like embellished detail
on the neckline and it's this lovely
white soft material very light and
floaty so you're not going to get too
hot and sweaty I just think the
embellished detail is so pretty but not
overboard I don't like too many bold
patterns on my cover-ups and to sort
this was very subtle and beautiful so
I'm looking forward to buying this
obviously you might have seen I have
already got my sunglasses on getting way
ahead of myself but when I go away on a
holiday I will be taking not one not two
probably three or four pairs of
sunglasses I like to have a more
expensive kind of posh pair for when I'm
at lunch or when I'm just kind of posing
and then a cheaper pair to wear when I'm
like in sea or just playing around so
for my fancy pair I have got this really
cute pair of ray-bans which are from the
sunglasses Hut and these are really
awesome because they are fold up so
they're a really cool just pink kind of
aviator style but the handy thing is
they just go down to an absolutely mini
mini size for in your beach bag and then
when I don't want to risk losing my nice
pair I have got this cheap pair from new
look and I really love these so like a
kind of gray brown tortoiseshell with
rose gold on and they were probably I
think like three 99 or $4.99 so these
are gonna be the path I'll be wearing
when I'm in the sea or running like
running around and I won't be too upset
if I lose these or break please
whereas obviously I would be if I broke
the ray-bans but yeah so definitely
cheaper pair of sunglasses for playing
around first thing we've got in the
actual beach bag are some bikinis this
is one I've picked up from fig leaves
it's from their sea Foley brand and I
just really love like the black and
white monochrome kind of French Riviera
chic of this it's a bandeau top with a
kind of Clippy detail on the back so
perfect for your tan lines or lack
thereof
and it's also got this like graphic kind
of triangle print on the zipper on the
front but I just thought this was very
like simple and chic and beautiful I
have the matching bottoms as well which
I've got these really cool like doubles
tome strap detail on the sides and they
also have a really small bottom which
for me is really important because I
don't like to have a really big like
baggy bikini bottoms but these have got
a really small bottom so I think these
are going to look really really cute on
also from fig leaves from one of their
brands called Antalya I picked up this
blue-and-white kind of stripe detail
bikini top this is more of like a
structured top it's got some under
wiring in there it also has a little bit
of slinky padding on the inside so if
like me you just want to add a little
bit more shape to your boobs on the
beach then this is absolutely perfect
for that and it's also really beautiful
it's got these rose gold studs on the
top here and you can either wear these
straps as like a halter neck or you can
just wrap it around the back so very
versatile bikini top and the bottoms are
really cute too they've got this like
twisty detail around the front and just
a really beautiful color so I'm looking
forward wearing this last kind of
fashion you piece I've got my Tory Burch
flip-flops which I picked up when I went
to Texas they are really cute for
wearing at lunchtime or when I'm heading
down to the boat and I'll also be taking
a slightly cheaper pair of flip-flop
of me for walking around the beach in
Corfu the beaches are all pebbles so you
definitely need to have something on
your feet when you're walking from one
end of the beach to the other but I'll
probably be taking these and another
pair of flip-flops with me okay so also
we have got my book I haven't actually
decided which book I'm gonna be taking
from my beach read I normally get
through about three or four books on a
10 day holiday so please let me know
your recommendations I love just really
easy
chicklet books nothing too hard-hitting
Sophie Kinsella is one of my favorite
Beach authors she writes the confessions
of a shopaholic series which I
absolutely love so I think she's got a
new and out recently but I normally just
buy my books from WH Smiths in the
airport so let me know if you have any
recommendations I normally take some
face wipes with me to the beach because
when you go to lunch you just want to
get the sea salt off and freshen up a
little bit so before you try and find a
smaller packet but these are some simple
skincare wipes and yeah something like
this but hopefully smaller it will be
handy from the beach bag makeup wise
obviously I don't want to wear too much
on the beach I'm normally a two product
or a three product face kind of gal on
holiday for the first few days on I'm a
little bit on the pale side I'll
probably put something on the face maybe
like an SPF 30 tinted moisturizer I
think my favourite at the moment is the
quarterly one so I'll probably pop that
in my beach bag for the first few days
and then for the rest of the holiday
once I've got a bit of a tan I will just
be wearing these two products so this is
a lip balm from Elizabeth Arden and it's
SPF 15 so it prevents your lips from
getting burnt but it's also a really
pretty kind of coral pink color so nice
to add a bit of lip color when you're on
the beach and then this is the Clarins
ultra waterproof mascara in fact I don't
know if that's the name but I call it
the ultra waterproof mascara because it
is so waterproof you never need to worry
about your mascara running even if
you're on like a banana boat and you
face plan the ocean you will be fine
with this mascara it will not budge so I
will literally just be relying on this
mascara for my beach holiday one more
kind of kozmetsky thing that I'll be
putting in my beach bag is a connect
Moisture Surge face spray so this is the
most refreshing thing when you're laying
in the Sun and you will just hot and
bother
and you want something refreshing and
moisturizing for your face this is
perfect just give it a few spritzes and
you face is fresh moisturize and it's
just so nice if you're getting a bit hot
and sweaty and you want to look fresh
then this is amazing I'll definitely be
taking this in my beach bag of course
one of the most important things is Sun
cream so I'll be using an SPF 30 for the
first few days at least of the holiday
and when I go to Corfu I'm gonna be
trying out his Wayne instant glow skin
illuminating Sun spray so the reason why
I love this so much is because it has
little flecks of like gold shimmer in it
so when you're a little bit conscious of
your legs burying them all after
probably like eight months of no
sunlight like my legs then you're going
to want a little bit of not makeup but
something to make your legs look a
little bit better and this is just a
little boost for ultra pale legs or legs
that haven't seen the Sun in a while
just until you get a bit more tanned and
Beach confident I always like to have a
specific Sun cream for my face and this
time I'm going to try out the Clarins
Sun wrinkle control cream for the face
so I recently had a facial and she did a
skin analysis on me where they use a
machine to look beneath the layers of
your skin and she actually said that I
already have a little bit of sun damage
on the layer beneath the top layer of my
skin so obviously I don't want to get
wrinkles too early and I don't want to
get burnt on my face so I'm gonna use
this one it's SPF 30 UVA UVB so
hopefully no burn on the face for me and
then a little bit later on in the
holiday for top-ups
I'm going to be using the Garnier ombre
slay gold and protect SPF 15 so this is
an oil and obviously oils make you turn
quicker because it intensifies the Sun
on your body but I won't be using this
on its own because I will just burn if I
do but I'll be using this as a top up on
top of my other SPF and then when I
finish tanning of course I'll be
applying after Sun and I'm gonna take
with me this new one from Carnes
it's their after Sun moisturizer with
self-tanning in it
so obviously enhances your natural tan
and has all the nourishing ingredients
in it for helping any sunburn
just generally helping the skin recover
so this is going to be a great one for
taking with me I've also got the john
frieda sea waves sea salt spray because
I find that my hair just goes a little
bit like large and frizzy and not Bond
girl Beach sexy at all but when I use
this it adds a little bit of kind of
crisp eNOS and texture to my hair so
we'll just give a little bit of wave
perfect for when I'm about to head into
lunch and just want to make a bit of an
effort so this is perfect for sticking
in the beach bag and then finally the
last thing in my bag is this towel which
I picked up from new look and it's just
really good fun it says eat sleep tan
repeat if you're not sure if you could
see that but it's just a really cool old
black and white towel which I think will
be a good fun on the beach so definitely
taking this one along and that's
everything that is in my beach bag I
have just noticed these two clips on my
beach bag I love to get my hair out of
my face whether I'm tanning or going in
the sea and these are some clips which I
picked up from new look they're just
cheap as chips like a few for three or
four pounds and I normally just curl my
hair into a bun and stick a clip in and
we're ready to go
so these live on my beach bag I have to
because I'm bound to lose one so
hopefully if I knew from there that I
won't lose them and the actual beach bag
itself is one that I got from the
Clarins press day just really love the
bright coral color and the rope straps
are very kind of just perfect for a
beach bag
it's huge as well it fits almost stuff
in it so this is going to be absolute
perfect and that's it that is everything
that is in my beach bag I hope you have
enjoyed rummaging through that bag with
me let me know if there's any
recommendations that you'll be taking on
the beach with you this summer just
