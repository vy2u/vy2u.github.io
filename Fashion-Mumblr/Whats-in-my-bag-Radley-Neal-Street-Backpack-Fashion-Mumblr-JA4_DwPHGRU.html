having a super day I am having a day
filming today if I'm honest with you and
I just finished filming a Primark and
H&amp;amp;M home haul in a very relaxed casual
way because if you've seen that one
you'll have heard how today's the chill
day and I'm wearing my slope clothes and
I've got really bad but bad eye bags so
why not deal what's in my handbag
basically the end to know if X is in an
autumn moon basically the end of the
Primark video I said to you I said what
you want to see um would you like to see
a house tour or what's my handbag when I
tweeted that question and quite a few
people said they'd like to see what's my
handbag if you can hear rustling
it's because little minxie is shredding
a bag and I'd rather you shredded the
bag a cardboard bag than anything else
I'm gonna let him get away with it so I
thought I'd film what's my handbag now
because of what the lighting setup had
quite like the lighting I mean
struggling so much with the lighting now
that it's autumn major problems and yeah
so thought I'd film what's my handbag
this is gonna be the most genuine what's
in my handbag ever but I can so imagine
that so many people put stuff in there
or take things out to make themselves
look more glamorous or more fun or maybe
they don't maybe I'm just really Chris
calm but I am I finished filming the
promo video about two minutes ago
probably not even that went to grab my
bag and it's really heavy I thought I
would show you what's inside it so let's
get cracking the bag itself is the
Radley I think it's called the Portman
backpack and might have got that wrong
so I'm going to leave a link down below
to this backpack you're probably bored
to death of this if you watch my usually
my blog or phone on Instagram because
I've been wearing it since before I went
to Italy I first started wearing out
showing since I'm a fashion week know
but so the Hamburg is actually a
rucksack it's got these two adjustable
straps on the back and also a little
pocket which I usually keep my spelling
there at the moment which is a bit
worrying I normally keep my credit card
at the back there which is contactless
which I use in my oyster card because
now that a blog full time I don't go
obviously interview the office or into
noé day so I no longer get my monthly
so use my credit card fun fact for you
and then on the front it's got a handle
so you can carry it like this if you
want to normal easy honest I carry it
like this
I do actually no I don't I could do one
strap and then I left strap dangle when
I was editing my outfit Dora's video
from an entity from Italy it looks
really faintly like a little tail
hanging but actually it was just a strap
from this bag the color I absolutely
love I love neutral colored handbags
because I think if you're going to
invest in a good bag then it should be a
neutral color because then it will go
with everything
so this is a lovely light gray and I
love grey all year round this will last
me like through to spring and summer
next year and you have known that I'm
beyond and it's quite a spongy leather
which is quite white clean easy care and
doesn't pick up too many marks I've I
think careful with this but not like I
would be with every expensive like a
mulloway handbag or something and it's
not got dirty or picked up any marks
which is great I often struggle with
shoulder it quite a lot as well
I seem to pack everything into my bag
and it's really heavy at the moment I
just really don't know what isn't here
that's so heavy we'll find out so it's
great when it is heavy or if I'm pairing
up survives I can wear like an actual
backpack which is super and also I'm not
the kind of person that ever thought I'd
be cool enough to wear a backpack
because of my everyday handbag and I'm
still not cool enough if I do and I love
this one so yeah let's have a look
what's inside it closes and opens with
this kind of buckle strap thing there
and then inside is my crap and and a
zipper pocket here can you see that so
if you pop it here and then there's two
pockets on the inside there are two
pockets so that's really handy I'm often
I keep other cards in there cuz I use
more often and let's start with these
little pockets so okay this is what's
inside that one pocket the other ones
empty five pound note so that's handy
and put that somewhere
thanks to can't chew it did you say
something
this is my credit card which I use my
oysters and then put that back in the
back pocket so I don't use it and then
I've got a receipt what sir sir
today we were four pounds cheaper ah
this is when I went to Tesco to pick up
food and pumpkins
there's my test carry suit then I have
some of my blog business cards in there
these are actually a little bit outdated
now here they are if you wanted to see
them you can see them with the lighting
so it's fashion mum lot on the front and
then it says juicy editor and creator my
mobile number email address and blog
website on the back and yeah they're
quite cute they're quite substantial
they're like that three three tiers so
it's white then a black sandwich in the
middle so that's a MC yeah the good
quality cards on from muqaam and I
always just have a copy of my handbag I
very rarely hand them out but that's
where you are so um I'm showing you then
I have a lens cap I've lost all the lens
caps on my olympus pen which is
appalling because i like to take care of
my belongings but i've lost all the lens
caps this is the lens cap for the camera
which i don't take out with me this one
here which is my canon so i don't know
why that was in my home bag but if you
know what i know why it's in my handbag
charlie is so CT tidy if he sees
something of mine dr. de round the house
he'll put it in my handbag that's why
that's in there and the thing that's
taking up oh i thought it's gonna be a
lot bigger and heavier the thing that
usually takes up a lot of room is my
makeup bag although today it's quite
empty I think it's because I put a lot
of my everyday makeup in my clutch bag
from last night from the party so this
is a fabric bag I like that it's star
bright because it means it can squish up
into whatever shape is available in your
handbag this was from one of the lovely
Beauty boxes and it says inner beauty is
great but a little makeup never hurt
which i think is lovely texture that's
another thing at my home watching my dad
- so let's have a quick look at what's
inside here it looks really like scabby
and not very glamorous as a beauty
blogger should be
but let's see so we've got a sachet of
the Estee Lauder Double Wear foundation
which I obviously grabbed from magazine
and thought be handy for is just in case
emergencies we've got another sachet
sachet it's clearly and this is of the
Clarence BB cream I always save sachets
I'm such a hoarder and they come in
handy and then I got some plasters these
look like they've been in here of quite
some Titans they're a little bit
battered but they're the fabric ones
from boots which don't budge once
they're in place
so really how these have some of it
isn't that then I've got the Sephora
blotting tissue paper which is these
ones here which to be honest I have not
used in a while but they're handy tab if
you're ever having a mega shining moment
I need to sort out I've got the origins
plant scription concealer which is
better than the NARS one for topping up
during the day so that's great for my
horrendously dark under-eye bags then
I've got the Vichy dermablend phone to
detain to compact cran this is a cream
foundation so it's great for coverage
but also anti shine and it's really
handy little container and knowing you
have lots of sponge so also I bet in
here I have my yeah I've got a little
blending brush which is from zoeva this
is the silk finish one or two brushes so
I just you know touch up my makeup with
this during the day and it mattifies as
well as on adding what's the word
coverage so absolutely love that that's
in there my Anastasia Beverly Hills brow
Wiz which is great for topping up brows
on the go I've got a shun Takei eyeliner
because it's so slim and skinny but
that's good for on-the-go
benefit posy tint I always have a lip
balm in my home bag when it gets to
autumn because my lips get really
chapped and dry this is pretty handy and
it has a lovely light pink color to it
as well this is the lip liner that I
wear on like an everyday basis it's the
Urban Decay 24/7 glide-on lip pencil in
the shade liar so this is pretty much my
daily lip liner perfume sample this is
misty or I always again keep these such
a hoard of minis because it's nice to
top up on the rope this is a sample of
the Ajanta coins
which is really really good so handy to
have minis in your makeup bag if you
want to add more mascara as the day goes
on which I do because I like to pick my
lashes it's just such a gross habit but
um yeah I do that then I've got benefit
Porefessional license to blot also looks
like a magazine freebie or something and
I might write that so don't you know why
that's in their benefit Boyan concealer
which is great before if you have any
like emergency spots which you just need
to cover in a dire situation and then
this comes in really handy this is a
very old dior retractable make sure you
go for applying powder or just like
blending yourself in and I'm really good
with making sure that I wash this quite
often as well because I use it quite a
lot during the day when maybe my skin is
got a little bit earlier so really
important to wash any brushes that you
keep in your handbag makeup bag
so that's the contents of my makeup bag
this does change quite frequently
normally it's filled with lipsticks
because whatever lipstick um where enjoy
the day I normally stick in my handbag
but only a couple of days ago I had to
clear out so there's not so many
lipsticks in there as it normally would
be the one thing I'm going to say about
this bag is that because it's white
fabric it does get quite dirty but I
will probably just stick it in the
washing machine at some point it'll be
clean again so not the end of the world
the next thing that's in there is this
which is my new portable phone charger
this is from anchor and Charlie actually
got me this from Amazon I did have one
of those lipstick shaped ones I could
paint quite much probably is actually
still in there and but it only did one
charge and it was very old so Charlie
really kindly got me this which has it's
bigger than my old one but not too big I
think this charges your phone three or
four times and for a girl on the run
like I spend a lot of my time when I do
a day in London I like to do a whole
daymond and like run all my meetings and
events into one day so it's great to
have a phone charger with me so that's
gonna come in really handy next thing in
my bag is my Krispy Kreme cards I did a
blog post for Krispy Kreme recently and
given a red card which means I can get a
box of 12 Donuts every month for a year
which is amazing so that's what this is
and they also gave me 12 green cards to
give away to my readers um which I think
are still active so if you sign up to
the pardon me little with text a moment
and yeah if you sign up to Friends of
Krispy Kreme can you are in with a
chance of winning one of these cards
which is free donuts for a year within
reason I think it's like a box you know
a box a month but yeah leave the blog
post down below so you can enter if you
like donuts and I've got my nail varnish
I I'm wearing at the moment purple heart
pearl from the H&amp;amp;M beauty range this is
literally the one I'm wearing right now
and I put this in my bag because I
wanted to top it up before my last day
in London and I normally do it when I
get on the tube even though that's
probably really disrespectful to people
I'm saying thanks to you but I just
don't have time to do it otherwise and I
hate like staying at home for 20 minutes
and not being honest anything on my
nails dry so that's why I had that in
that and I got an umbrella this is a
really small one I don't know where this
is from it's not a terribly good quality
one it's just a small umbrella
I've lost the case to it annoyingly but
it's very small and light so it's good
handbag on brother collab mini dry
shampoo and I use it more as a
volumizing missed than no dry shampoo
like probably now my hair could do with
it
and also if I'm having one of those days
when my roots are really bad I'll just
spray a little bit of dry shampoo on it
even though this isn't one of the blonde
ones and but it just helps to lighten
the roots and this is a great size to
keep them in the handbag this is a
collab a dry shampoo in Monaco
then I have a little hand sanitizer this
is from fantastic cleaners which is
where I take a dexter or actually I
think it's called fantastic doggy
daycare and it's where I take Dexter on
days when I can't be a whole new day so
and they have a little goodie bag so
when you take your dog there and this
isn't in it
this is a watermelon and bacterial hand
gel which is so useful if you live in
London or if you generally are aware of
Hygiene like the amount of germs you get
on your hands and then eat it's gross
so it's really handy to have this in my
handbag and it smells amazing got my
camera this should be in a case but it's
not especially as I don't have a lens
cap and this if you don't notice what I
do my vlogs on it's the olympus pen ep-1
it's amazing because it has the flip
down screen so I can just be talking to
myself and I can see myself and it's
generally generally the best camera ever
I wrote a whole blog post on this and
the camera that I use to video in for a
normal video so I'll link that down
below in fact I think is always linked
below in all my videos so if you're
interested in what I use to video and
photographic then check out that blog
post next I've got this little cordially
string bag which usually has my camera
in it or my spare lens because I also
use the 75 mil lens no I don't that's
what I want to get and I also use the 45
mil lens from Olympus to create those
lovely blurry background shots so
normally my camera and spell enzyme
battery live in this and my phone which
I'm actually surprised that that was in
there cuz I thought I've used my phone
since I've used my bag pretty Charlie
tidying up again but yeah there's my
phone it is a gold iPhone 6 plus with a
Kate Spade case on it in case you've not
seen my phone before yeah notice my top
notification is Charlie irons shared
candy kittens post and then my purse and
while I show you my personal also show
you my card holder because he's match
and they're both from Kate Spade and
they are both from the Kate Spade sample
so I were trying to pause a year ago now
excuse me little blog so I think I paid
about 25 pounds and 30 pounds for these
which as you're probably know is amazing
for Kate Spade like absolutely amazing
so I'll start with the purse it is light
pink metallic kind of material and it's
got a pocket in the back which Scott
stamps in it
citing and their zip closure and quite
full I have got cash receipts I'm just
seeing if anything interesting I can
show you don't there is VIP pass at home
card don't know why I still have this
this is my old unique art from when I
went to London College of Fashion
doesn't want for student discounts don't
know why I still have that in there I've
got loads of receipts and what else this
is my net card taxi receipts another
krispy kreme card loyalty cards should I
do what's in my purse as well was that
really boring just had to change the
battery of my camera so I'm sorry if
it's in a slightly different position
and but back to you my purse so I have
lots of loyalty cards in here I'm not
gonna go through them all but Space NK
new look frozen yogurt McDonald's the
coffee is I'm not a big McDonald's eater
but I like that coffees and then I have
loads of foreign currencies I tend to
like keep currencies from cool places
I've been to so I've got 10 pounds from
the Bank of Egypt this is the same 1 US
dollar roll in five US dollars this is
500 shillings from the bank of Tanzania
and then I have five thousand shillings
from the bank of Tanzania which has a
rhino on it which is quite cool no
Dexter see I have a few currencies in
there which are a little bit unusual or
have any nice memories for me what else
this is my super drug bloggers Network
30% off I totally forgot that I had that
oh my gosh could have saved so much
money yeah that's my purse I'm not going
to go through all the cards because I
don't really think you find that
interesting so that's it's getting quite
light now which is good I've got some
panadol extra paracetamol tablets
because I am quite prone to headaches so
I always keep these in my handbag just a
couple and I've got my powder which
should be able to make a bad decision
lebesgue which is lovely for topping up
on the go it's got a little brush and
powder and mirror which is so handy and
it doesn't give a catch finish so it's
fine for just sticking on every whatever
make it leave for on during the day
another tablet pen this is a pen and a
highlighter in one which I got from the
reward style masterclass so yeah black
biro a lipstick this is the Urban Decay
matte stark-naked lipstick which again
with the line which I showed you my
makeup bag is pretty much my everyday
autumn lip combo then I got my house
keys and it's got my cell gym membership
toggle on it which is ironic because I
have been to the gym since I finished my
job which was before Fashion Week so
like July and then last things in there
are a couple of hair bubbles and hair
grips that's where they all go and I can
never find them that's it my bag is now
nice and empty and as I said that was
completely unedited angle but yeah
that's what was inside my handbag I hope
you found that insightful and probably
not the most interesting what's my
handbag in the world because as I said
it's just so that is the contents of my
Radley backpack should I call this all
what's on my hand Michael what's in my
backpack I think I'll call it or what's
in my handbag just from searchability
and all that but I hope you guys have
enjoyed this video and I'd love to know
what kind of things you keep in your
handbag if anything in here surprised

have which I don't just let me know in
