it's Wednesday the 21st of December
today Christmas is so close I'm starting
to feel really excited for Christmas now
I'm really starting to wind down and
just finish all my work because all my
friends are finishing work and I'm
getting jealous
so yeah I'm trying really hard to tie up
all the loose ends today is also
probably the darkest day of the year I'm
looking out the window now and you would
not believe that it's ten o'clock in the
morning it is so dark it feels like five
pm
so I'm gonna fuel up on coffee and have
a really productive morning despite the
gross weather but before I do that I
just got OOP
a little order from H&amp;amp;M that got
delivered so I'm gonna try on a few
pieces and I want your opinion on what I
should keep and why should stand back I
don't think I've ever done an online hmm
order before maybe I have four hmm home
but I realized that actually buying
online is really easy from H&amp;amp;M so I
picked up a few basics and a really
really nice cashmere jumper which I've
kind of already decided I'm going to
keep but I'm going to try on a load of
bits and bobs they're all such good
prices as well like all of these things
are things that are on trend right now
like lots of ruffles lots of frills lots
of over knee boots so let's get cracking
okay so this is obviously my H Lambert's
and Bob's but I also did a little a
sauce order I picked up a few pieces
which I'm actually gonna be showing you
guys in a lookbook video but oh my gosh
can we just take a moment to appreciate
these shoes
how beautiful are these I don't think
I've seen any pink mules that I love as
much as the Gucci ones on the high
street until I saw these ones let's try
them on now I just could not resist
getting these excuse my leggings how
cute
oh they're adorable oh my gosh and also
I've been wearing my Zara mules so much
because they're just so easy to slip on
so as soon as I saw these I knew they
had to be mine
so yeah got those from a sauce at
we love them and then the first bit that
I got from H&amp;amp;M is this beautiful jumper
this is a cashmere knit so it's
beautifully soft but I think it was
around 69 pounds so really not bad value
for cashmere really liked this ruffle
detail I think it looks really high-end
I think if you pair this with the right
accessories it could look incredibly
expensive so let me put this on and show
you guys please excuse my leggings who I
lie do this try on haul but yeah this is
pretty much what I wear around the house
most days and I'm working from home
whenever I wear them I get so many
questions these ones actually from Jack
Wills but a couple of years ago so I
will try to find something similar and
leave it down in the description box all
the bits and bobs in my haul as well as
I always do I will leave links where
possible down below not sure if it'll
work on the HMO website but I'll give it
a try so this is the jumper and it's
just so beautiful I love the fit I
normally wear between a 4 and a 6 and I
went for a 6 and it fits really well it
doesn't have defined shoulder areas so
if like me your shoulders are a little
bit broad then it's probably absolutely
fine for you I really like that these
are in like a bib detail as well yeah
love this really very wearable color so
I'm sure I'm gonna get tons of use out
of this
so really pleased with my first purchase
from H&amp;amp;M next up another basic piece I
think this was like around 10 pounds it
really wasn't expensive at all but I was
really attracted to this ruffle collar
it's been a trend that I've really loved
this autumn winter and the only other
ruffle color thing that I've got is from
Karen Millen and that was almost 100
pounds if not it will actually was 100
pounds so I thought this would look
really nice
hello so change do you approve do you
approve yes mummy I'm sitting on it
which is my seal of approval well I'm
sorry but I'm just showing it so
everybody so you're going to have to
move come on Suzy
hey come on little chaps got to move
their boot a day
he's like why did the mommy mommy so I
got it in quite a neutral color and
because I did oh my god
because I did by this to intend for it
to be a layering piece but let me show
you what it looks like on okay here is
the jumper I just absolutely love this
ruffle neck detail I think this looks so
beautiful such a nice touch if you like
wearing high neck jumpers and you like
to put maybe sandals hung underneath
like I do then this is really great
because it is long long-sleeve a high
neck so you can put stuff underneath it
you do need to quite careful what briar
you wear if I had any detail on this bra
it would really show and because it is a
cheaper piece I can kind of tell from
the quality the elasticity in it is not
as good as more higher-end pieces I have
but for a layering piece I think it's
pretty good and this may look like the
exact same jumper but in gray but
actually it feels better quality and the
neck is slightly higher slightly thicker
material and it also has fluted sleeves
so I think this will look really cool on
this is very much like Instagram street
style I can imagine a few of my favorite
fashion Instagram is wearing this I
think it should look really cool and
once again I think if you have any jewel
a type items that would look really
awesome over the top of this once again
I think we've got this little men's seal
of approval
have we mr. sauce but look at his paws
the only thing his paws are so beautiful
I love these little patches on them so
here is the gray top really like this
one it feels so much better quality than
the camel colored one it's got a
slightly higher neck and you can see
it's got like a ruffle neckline pretty
hard to show you the 19 here is so bad
apologies about my hair as well this is
what happens when I try Rolex on just
goes completely fluffy the sleeves are
really really cool I think this would
look really nice as part of like a ski
wardrobe I'm hoping to get a ski trip in
the diary soon but yeah this would look
really cool with my thermals underneath
it God you must be so bored about me
talking of thermals yeah I'm really
impressed with this one I don't think
I'm gonna keep the camel one now having
right this because this one is just such
better quality and yeah I think the
color is really versatile as well if you
perhaps address low it more casually for
work then maybe some high-waisted white
denim jeans with this would look really
chic or I don't know maybe if you've got
like a white juillet or any color
juillet would look really really cute I
think it would also look really nice
with a camel colored skirt that is most
definitely on my wish list if you guys
know anywhere that has a really good
quality like no more than like 150
pounds suede camel skirt and that's
definitely on my wish list so let me
know I think that would look really cute
with this outfit this next one feels so
lovely and soft and what makes a little
bit different to your normal layering
pieces is this nice detail on the bottom
so simple but I think if you're looking
for winter basics then these kind of
details just make it stand out from all
the usuals I think this in itself could
be a good thermal layer so if you like
to have things underneath your knitwear
oh my god you stretch those little legs
look at these poor dyndns oh my god I
love you so much but you do get in the
way little chap stop licking your bot
bot when mummy is trying to do a whole
video scoot your bootie so we've now got
dog fluff on it yeah let's try on this
beautiful white layering top really like
this it is so soft and I just think that
everybody needs like a plain white
layering piece for that winter wardrobe
so practical and then the little details
on the sleeves and on the bottom hem
just give it a little point of
difference to your everyday white top I
think for I don't know if you just need
extra layers if you do live anywhere
colder or if you just don't like being
cold then it's nice to have layering
pieces in your wardrobe and this is just
a little bit different to your usual so
definitely keeping this was not
expensive at all as I said Karim of the
prices and annoyingly they're not on the
labels but I'll leave the links to
everything down below what do you think
to them are rating ding what do you
think - this one give me one kiss if you
like it in two pieces if you don't
you're the best dog in the world
you know that my room oh this was in my
H&amp;amp;M box because I put all of my shopping
together I basically just bought a load
of black socks from ASOS these are black
with a little bow on them I guess I was
just stocking up on essentials really so
yeah I've got some black socks you can
never have too many and then the next
thing I got from H&amp;amp;M are these little
shoes not sure how I feel about them now
I've got them because the leather is
quite stiff and traditionally I'm not
very good with flat shoes so I'm not
sure if I'll be able to keep these on my
feet but thank you for helping me thank
you little man as you can see they're
really beautiful with the ruffle detail
around the opening and pointed toe small
heels so really on trend I think if you
can wear flat shoes then these are
absolutely stunning and earn a price but
I'm sure to have really good prize
probably no more than like 25 pounds if
that but I'm hot on let's just have a
look on the receipt does it stay here uh
shoes shoes shoes oh my god
$14.99 that is so good
yeah I think for me these aren't gonna
be right because they are just too stiff
but if you like flat shoes $14.99
that's actually incredible I am just
dying to show you these because I cannot
believe how amazing these are and I
think these are like 35 pounds again let
me just check $39.99 for knee-high boots
and the color of these is just
absolutely beautiful I'm gonna have to
put normal trousers on on to I feel like
they're not gonna go very well with my
Jack Wills leggings so let me just put
the top on let's see what other top can
I try on well have I tried on all the
tops
oh no I bought this like silky blouse
because it had I think it was fluted
sleeves and scalloped like frilly
sleeves and then a scalloped collar I
know it doesn't have a scar collar I'm
making things up but yeah I'm gonna try
this on I think once again if you wear a
school uniform that you're allowed to
slightly make amends to or if you have a
smarter job that requires you to wear a
nice blouse then this could be a really
lovely one because the detail on the
sleeves is just so pretty so I'll try
this on Miss and
means and then I can show you the bits
okay so the blouse I'm not 100% sure
about I think if you are good at ironing
and don't mind I mean your clothes then
perhaps it's fine but I don't know it's
come out of the box looking a little bit
creased however I do love the material
boots though love oh my gosh these look
I mean I've tried a lot of affordable
boots I've tried kogai got pretty little
thing public desire you name it apart
from like the expensive ones do Weitzman
none of them quite get it right but
these yes $39.99
I actually prefer these to the 100 200
pound coat geiger ones they fit
beautifully I feel like they're the
really nice length which is really leg
flattering I can't believe you believe
these are $39.99 so impressed hmm
seriously impressed the heel feels like
a really nice height not too high not
too low the color is just beautiful I
feel like when I wear these and my
friends gave me like where are they from
they are not going to believe me when I
say hmm so beautiful I will be sure to
leave a link to these look at my sausage
dog slipper whoop the way I'll be sure
to leave a link to these down below
because I'm pretty sure you guys are
gonna love these as much as I do
and they probably won't be around for
long and these kind of things I can just
never find in the hmm stores much prefer
shopping online so yes
really really really pleased with these
it seems that I ordered two pairs of
those boots by accident so I'm not gonna
get these ones out because they are
exactly the same another pair of a saw
sucks because I got three pairs a sauce
tights I got 50 dÃ©nia and 80 Donia
literally just stocking up on basics at
the moment also from H&amp;amp;M I got these
coasters but these are definitely going
back because I thought they were going
to be ceramic but they're cardboard and
I feel like cardboard coasters don't
look very nice um I mean they're fine
for barbecues but yeah not very
impressed so they're gonna go back
but I'm really really happy with these
so I picked up one medium-sized bottle I
just thought I kind of got it as a
tester I might buy some more of these
really nice size for cereal or for like
a bowl of fruit and yogurt and I just
really loved this simplistic design
you've got this white kind of a ribbed
porcelain with the gold on top and then
I got the same again but the big version
is like a salad bowl so I thought they
looked really lovely and really good
prices from each none so those are the
bits and bobs that I picked up on my HTM
online order I am now going to run down
to Dajjal and do a drop off of the bits
that I'm returning
I also have some pieces from a misguided
order to return and misguided I always
forget they have a really short returns
policy I think you have to return the
pieces within 14 days instead of 30 so
yeah gonna take that down to doddle now
and see if I've got any blogger mail I
also know that there's all I'm hoping
there's some things there for Charlie
for Christmas and charlie is out today
he's gone to a hotel called the great
Fosters in Surrey with his friend Nathan
and they're going for afternoon tea
which is so cute and so yeah while
Charlie's out
I'll run still pick up some of his gifts
fingers crossed and then I wrap them but
I'm not gonna show you guys what they
are just in case I don't think try
watching my vlogs I think he watches
anymore videos but just in case I won't
show you and if you want I will do
actually let me know so do you guys want
to see a what I got for Christmas video
let me know in the comments if that was
something you'd like to see I've never
done one before but last year a few guys
actually asked me to do one I didn't do
one I'm really sorry I just didn't find
the time to do it and then I think it
gots like January the certain eyes like
Nance
too late now so let me know if you'd
like me to do it let me know when I
should publish it I just don't know
these things and let me know if you'd
like Charlie to get involved too but as
you saw from yesterday's vlog didn't
really work honey unboxed up together so
maybe I'll do a bit and then I'll let
him just like take over so let me know
let me know either way I'm gonna stop
rambling now and get startled so I'm
taking my returns because I have got
three parcels hmm Topshop and ASOS and
Charlie got me this kind of was like a
jokey present for my
today because I always struggle to carry
my blogger mail back from dawdle so I'm
gonna put it to some good use how funny
is this it's like one of these old
person trolleys but it's got dogs on it
so thanks darling I'm actually gonna use
it made it back from Dajjal in one piece
I also went to Marks and Spencers and
got some Christmas nibbles
because Rory and Nathan the offerings
that are now living in Hong Kong are
coming over tomorrow so I thought I'd
get some of the Christmas canapes
they have such a nice selection in there
and it was four for three so I got a few
nice nipples I took more money trolley
as I showed you earlier and it has
returned with loads of lovely bits and
bobs so I'll open that for you now but
also more excitingly we also have a
Dajjal bloggers mail for Dexter rainy
mommy's got pretties for you I think
it's from Lily's kitchen so first of all
let's open Dexter's blog away oh ok

preoccupied at the moment mummy but um

okay sausage which we give you to start
with I might give him a festive turkey
and cranberry treat my next blog Amell
is sadly not in usage no it's the money
this is absolutely beautiful and so much
more beautiful in real life than I even
thought it would be on the website it's
the watch from Michael Kors which was
kindly sent to me by boutique
Goldsmith's
so that is a shop in Westfield Stratford
and obviously the perfect place to go
for last-minute Christmas gifts because
you don't need to worry about shipping
times in actual shops so they've sent me
this to celebrate their Christmas
offering so let's get this out and try
it on Texas just enjoying his Lily's
kitchen treats I literally do not think
a watch could be any more perfect for my
style so it's rose gold and then it's
got this beautiful very pale pink almost
mother-of-pearl strap and then you've
got the rose gold links either side I
think I've already have to take a few
out so it should be too much of a
problem and then the face of the watch
you've got these diamante zall around
the edge let's take off the plastic so
satisfying and then hopefully you can
see on the camera the actual watch face
is mother-of-pearl so beautiful I feel
like this is just gonna go with every
single one of my outfits it's just
such a perfect color for me and
obviously Michael Kors jewelry is all
available in the Goldsmith's boutique in
Westfield Stratford they also do repair
and servicing in the store itself so if
you did want to buy something like this
for someone that you know has got a
slightly smaller wrist and you could
definitely get a few of the links taken
out in the boutique in Stratford and
they've also got gifts for guys as well
Emporio Armani watches
they've got Michael Kors for men and
then they've also got for women they've
got like Olivia Burton watches and
jewelry as well not just watches so it's
a really lovely place to get a really
special give someone and so you guys
gonna watch him this vlog on the 22nd so
you'll still definitely have time if you
do live in London then actually I'm well
overdue a trip to Westfield Stratford so
maybe I'll try and find time to go there
in the next couple of days but but if
not then I'm definitely gonna make time
after Christmas to check out all the
sales but thank you very much to

stunning I'm so excited to wear this you

good timing so thank you to the
beautiful girls at melissa Oda bash and
then I got on the same kind of lines
holiday preparation got a gift from Vita
Liberata and as you know my all-time

serum so two new serums from
bareMinerals

really like the packaging this week
we've also got some new shampoo and
conditioner from OGX so this is one of
my favorite brands well not only mine

to hair care we just kind of leave it in
the shower and it's just something that
you can always rely on this is their new
OH - range so really nice for keeping
the hair lightweight and just wow I
don't know exact right yeah that's who
the press release said and oxygen
technology and cadbury oil fresh formula
apps to
moisturise volumize and breathe life
into fine hair that sounds really lovely
and then there's also as well as a
shampoo and conditioner a weightless oil
and lifting tonic
I might actually give it up to my mum
because she suffers from fine hair that
needs a little bit of volume bit more
than ideas and we pop that aside for her
and I think was that everything I got a
giant cookie from and feel unique which
is very lovely of them I think it's a
chocolate cookie yeah lavender dark
chocolate giant cookie and also a VIP

think these are going to be stocking
fillers for me Oh an annoyingly my
pastor so Charlie didn't arrive yet so

run downstairs and pack the few bits and
bobs pack wrap the bits and bobs that
have arrived for him hopefully before he
gets back I just realized I didn't also
tell you when I was opening my blog a
mail a second ago but I got a card from
one of you guys that is so cute I've
never got a Christmas card from a viewer
before so thank you so much - rosemary
fern that is so so kind of you - dear
Josie Charlie and Dexter with love from
rosemary and Keith have fun at Christmas
Rose me that is so sweet good
investigative skills finding my double
address as well so thank you so much
that means a lot to me and you got a
card as a sausage don't want it guys the
best thing in the world oh my god I
think I'm gonna cry oh dear Josie moving
on simply Charley's has got that from
the Great Falls coming it was awesome
that's really good and he bought me some
treats he's got a little goodie bag with
some pastries inside and also some
scones so I have those with my key
tomorrow huh be nice storm known about
and
and we're gonna make a really lovely
hearty dinner I'm gonna do muddling
shores life-changing tomato soup which I
think I talked about in a favorites
video a little while ago so so easy to
make you just stick all the ingredients
in the blender so we're just gonna pop
it all in our Thermomix we just went to
Tesco and got some fresh bread so
cooking towards dexter is having organic
lamb with carrots oh you lucky boy you
lucky boy I don't really like my sugar
daddy so I was raving about our ceramics
in yesterday's vlog because it's
basically amazing blender where you can
adjust the speed there's so many things
like it has a recipe book felt inside it
but that's the whole of the story it
what I really liked when I was using it
yesterday is that it does have the speed
adjuster so when I wanted to keep my
almond pieces really big I just slowed
the speed down and but today for example
the recipe says finely grated ginger
then don't know about you but I cannot
be bothered to grate ginger so because I
can also turn the blender up really fast
it will basically obliterate this ginger
so I don't need to worry about grating
it so I'm just literally shoving all the
ingredients in to the soup stuff and
easy and
these are my treats from the great
Fosters after a tomato soup I think I've
got a walnut cake Victoria sponge and
what's this whoa did you try this
mm-hmm thanks darling okay upstairs now
it's half past 9:00 charlie now just
getting ready to go to bed but it's
gonna have a look with a pumper
you guys saw me opening the glam glow
facemask bloggers mail in my blog two
days ago it went live today for me so
yes today for you yeah my last this is
the glam glow gravity mud firming
treatment and this is the most expensive
of a glam glow Bunch I think this one is
like sixty pounds so it's gonna have to
be pretty impressive glam glow is a
brand I've only tried their silver one
and their black one before both of which
I've been really impressed with the
brand as a whole is doing so so well
they just got bought by no no they got
bought like a year ago by Estee Lauder
companies I think some crazy like 125
million awesome things they're doing
very very well indeed so an American
brand Californian I actually met the two
founders of it at an event a couple
years ago and that was really cool they
were very passionate and yeah I've been
impressed with everything from them I've
tried before so this says apply a
generous even layer to clean skin with a
brush I'm enjoying using my glam glow
brush avoiding the eyebrows and the
hairline leave on for 20 to 30 minutes
the treatment will change color as it
dries once completely dry gently peel
off from the edges I love a peel off
face mask so rinse off the excess with
warm water
gosh that means I'm gonna be up until 10
o'clock waiting first to dry so I'm not
gonna hang around let's do it
I see
in the trees I see
so you can't actually see this on camera
but it's actually silver and now it
looks white but it is actually pale and
silver
all right uni pan it's really guilty as
well to know what
considering how expensive this is and
the fact that it's only shoes
what Allah
it's a button margin I'm feeling a
little bit like the Tin Man from line
which in the wardrobe brothers I just
have still so cheeky it makes my teeth
it really yellow because the mask is so
white it's already tingling and I guess
that's a good sign
if it doesn't tingly wings to not do
anything and yeah I would say I've
actually used and I've not gone crazy
with the amount that I've put on it but
it did say generous layer and but I'd
say I have used about quarter of this
tub so that means you're spending about
15 pounds per pound the night so this is
going to have to have some serious
dramatic effects to put you at that
price it's quite pricey go on you you
explain what you're doing I mean let
Charlie take over
leave you anything I'm not used to using
these brushes it's sort of a bit new to
me normally it just gets a bit messy so
let's do this it's a little bit good
it's quite poopy isn't it Oh
now I'm gonna nervous about this one
it's quietly fee I was not very good at
all at school so this could be quite a
disaster
I don't like that way okay Charlie's
taken over my vlog for vlogmas I feel
like if you ever did paid for papier
mÃ¢chÃ© at school I kind of feel like
I'm doing that on my face I cut it it's
quite hard to do it in the camera
actually I don't really know how this is
going well I actually went to someone's
birthday party as a Silver Surfer ones
and this is making me remember some
pretty drunk and Knight pretty drunk
good night Josh this is not going well
in front of a camera I can't
multitask yeah it smells really for a
facemask this smells really good because
a lot of the face of artists you get
which are clay based can have a bit of a
pond to them watching us thinking I look
bit ridiculous but then if you've used
peed off once before but the end bit is
the most satisfying thing it gave my
soul serious why don't you get so lose
serious actually watch back yeah it's
more silver as you go I mean all the way
a bit
really look yeah I look I do look quite
whether this is actually stinging
another
is stealing out of it I'm not sure I
should have put this on straight after a
hot shower because my pores are open o
mine sting
I need a hat cause well I need to get my
button gangsters having his hair cut
tomorrow
Charlie's on the news Charlie's thinking
about dyeing his hair sober
yeah we should do a pollen or Twitter
told everyone through that as well do
you do it on your neck no no um I just
want to mix up fresh new year fresh new
lid
but no I notice because I have short
hair
if I die and it's terrible
which isn't a high possibility it you
know I can get it cut and it's fun and I
am going a tiny bit gray so I thought
why not step in it to my time machine
and see what the future looks like Jason
so it's what is it Wednesday night in
the week before Christmas everyone else
is probably out partying tequila Diego
bombs celebrating and where he'll be
rammed and where he are in bed at 9:30
painting your face in silver I know
we're on relevee I'd rather be here with
Dexter I mean mine how do we look good
okay um now
and we're back in the room so I've now
had mine on for like five minutes
look into my eyes not around the eyes
only into my eye then you and okay so
while Charlie has been ever so slowly
putting his face mask on I hope you
enjoyed his little skin care takeover
I've been allowing mindset and it's
getting more silver and feeling more and
more like the Tin Man as we speak but
I'm really excited to peel this off
so exciting seals are still a lot more
white than mine yeah he always does this
he chooses my most expensive face masks
and then I look like a massive dick Lehr
yours all right come here darling let's
go Sophie three two one yeah this is off
things have become too right away okay
it's half an hour later we're gonna try
peeling off these bad boys yes we've got
James Bond on in the background you're a
nincompoop right that's it I feel like
maybe I put a little bit too much on
because some areas don't feel dry
oh actually nearly all came off how's
yours going well there's no gunk in it
it's not a peel off as though like it
grabs the dirt from your skin no I'm
doing our mission it was like I guess it
works better if you're a little bit
wrinkly which I'm not yet so maybe I'll
have to try this in a few years when
I've got some wrinkles it's probably
lost on me or that expensive yeah maybe
it's got some collagen in it maybe I'll
get some I'm not that she's wrinkly but
she's got a few more wrinkles than I
have so maybe she can let me know if it
works or not okay so I'm gonna take a
funnel and rinse my face get rid of all
these drags and then put on my normal
nighttime moisturizer and then I'm gonna
go to bed so I'm gonna end the vlog here
thank you for watching and I will see
you right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
