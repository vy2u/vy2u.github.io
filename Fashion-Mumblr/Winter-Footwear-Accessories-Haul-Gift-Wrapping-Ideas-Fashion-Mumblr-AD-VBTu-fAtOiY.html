joining me for today's video which is
going to be a winter footwear and
accessories haul and also some gift
wrapping as well because of the other
pieces that I've picked up today are
actually gifts for some friends so I
thought I would share the wrapping
process with you and maybe give you a
few tips on how to create some Pinterest
web presence so today's video I'm very
excited to say is in collaboration with
doddle and I'm sure you guys have heard
me talking about dollar before it's the
place where I pick up all my blogger
mail but as well as that it's the best
place to pick up your online orders it's
especially designed for those with
hectic and busy lifestyles like myself
and they make picking up your post and
also doing the returns a million times
easier they have stores I think there's
over 80 stores across the country in
really convenient locations very often
near train stations so you can pick up
your mail as you travel home from work
as well as this their opening hours are
really long they open super early and
they've shut really late seven days a
week so it couldn't be easier to fit in
to your hectic schedules also if your
time poor the past solicitors as they
call them in the store will make sure
that you're in and out within a couple
of minutes so you don't need to waste
any time queueing for either posting or
returning your online shopping so all
around just an amazing service I rely on
dawdle so many things so it's fantastic
that I'm being able to team up with them
to bring you today's video and as well
as the video I've also paired up with
them for a competition so stick around a
little bit longer to find out how you
can win a 100 pounds worth of shoes and
bags from Dajjal and Scheuer holux
so shoe holux is the retailer where i've
picked up all the pieces for today's
haul and in case you haven't heard of
them they're basically the official
Outlet Store for Kurt Geiger so you can
pick up current and past seasons stock
for ridiculously discounted prices and
as well as Kirk Eiger
they've got Carvel err ugh Michael
Michael Kors and loads of other brands
on there as well and they're all up to
75% off the shop price it's a really fun
place to go for gifts and also treats to
yourself at a huge bargain using doddle
is the easiest way to collect your
shopping from Scheuer holux you simply
go to
click and Collect option at the checkout
and then scroll down to find your
nearest doddle store and it goes there
completely free and it's even free to
return some of the Donald stores even
have changing rooms so if you want to
try on your items there and then if
anything doesn't fit you can just send
it straight back it really is so easy
I'm sure you guys have seen me doing it
in my vlogs over and over again so
without further ado let's get started
and let me show you what I picked up
from schewe Hollis so all my pieces are
in these Dajjal carry bags the first
thing that I picked up is actually a
gift but it's gonna be quite hard for me
to wrap so I probably make this video a
little bit hard of myself and I could
have done but this I'll get it out of
plastic graphics I can show you a little
bit more easily so here we go now that
I've got it in the flesh I'm wondering
if I I'm gonna give it as a gift or keep
it for myself this so gorgeous it's this
beautiful blush pink color it's coming
up a little bit orange on camera but it
is pink I can guarantee you that and
it's just beautiful that almost like a
faux alligator leather I mean I'm pretty
sure it's not real alligator because of
the price tag and then a very very
spacious backpack you could definitely
fit like a Macbook in there if you've
got these slightly smaller MacBook
probably not the big one really spacious
inside you've also got a back pocket
here and then this is this one
absolutely gianormous compartment in
there so really good backpack if maybe
you cycled to work and you want
something a little bit more chic or
maybe you know someone that cycles to
work there's still time for those
Christmas orders and then these lovely
long straps at the back I think this is
a really really good size very practical
could even be a school bag as well so
for this I'm gonna require a lot of
wrapping paper so good job I got some I
think it was like half price and M&amp;amp;S
earlier today yeah I picked this up on
my way back from dawdle 6 pounds down to
three pounds book the next thing that I
got from Scheuer holux is also a gift
and it's this beautiful carvalho purse
so my mom has actually been wanting me
new purse was so long the old one that
she's using at the moment I actually got
her from a Kate Spade sample sale a
little while ago but she absolutely
loves this color she's always eyeing up
my purse which is a very similar color
to this it's this beautiful Saffiano
leather as well which is a lot more hard
wearing than that spongy leather doesn't
really scratch so it should be a really
lovely long
in person and this one is not sure if I
mentioned is Caravela so really looking
forward to giving this to Mum I think
she'll really really like this one and
then for my sister-in-law I picked up
this set of ugh earmuffs she's always
complaining about hat hair but she
doesn't want her ears to get cold when
she's out walking the dogs so really
annoying either attached to the tub but
I can still show you so these are the
earmuffs they're a beautiful lilac II
gray color which i think is just so
stylish so classic and they come in this
lovely tub here with Ag written on it
these were I think they were about 30
percent off the shop price I'm not sure
but I'll leave links to all the products
down below so if you love any of them
then you can go and shop them yeah so it
comes in this really beautiful box which
to be honest once again is going to be
really hard to wrap but we will give it
a go so as well as the three gifts I
also picked up some treats for myself
because I couldn't say no to those
amazing prices and first of all I picked
up a pair of shoes from Caravela
and so it's car bellacor Kiger and as I
mentioned is the official outlet so
really really good prices the shoes in
question are these absolutely beautiful
boots so I've been looking out some flat
black boots for quite some time and what
drew me to these is the beautiful detail
on the heel you've got this lovely gold
almost like a stirrup effect on the heel
and then it's suede on the outer area
and then leather along the back so
they're going to be a really beautiful
fit hopefully they'll fit quite snug to
my leg but I just thought oh really
beautiful classic design and because
they're car better you know they're
going to really good quality but at that
amazing discount price so that's the
first pair that I picked up and the next
pair are from Kurt Geiger themselves
these I could not believe it when I saw
these on the site because I actually
tried these on when I went shopping in
the Kerr gigas store in common garden
like two weeks ago so these are very
much current seasons and they are done I
cannot believe that these were on that
website at such a good price so these
are black ankle boots with a gold
metallic heel you may know if you've
been watching my vlogs recently I did
pick up a very similar pair from Kurt
Geiger and now I kind of regret that
because these are just as nice and a
fraction of the price so I think that
these will just go with so many things
or jeans
with any outfit
black tights they will just look
absolutely fabulous and such a perfect
heel Heights as well and they're really
good quality I find with black ankle
boots because I wear them so much I do
want to invest a little bit more and
just get something that I know will last
me a long time and these most definitely
will I think I'm going to get so much
wear out of these so proud of myself for
this little fine I absolutely love them
if you guys love them as much as I do as
I said
links will all be down below so now that
I've showed you what I've picked up
let's move on to the wrapping part of
this video and you attempt to wrap the
massive rucksack although that could be
a bit of an epic fail and then also the
purse and the ear muffs
I really have to set myself a challenge
to have a night so I'm going to move
over to the coffee table and get
wrapping okay so welcome you to my
wrapping station what I've got with me
is some craft paper this was part of my
little trio from Marks &amp;amp; Spencer and
then I've also got a few bits and bobs
that I've collected over the past few
weeks these are just some cute little
snowflakes from I think these are from
the white company and then I've also
just been on Amazon and I've ordered
some string I quite like my presents to
look a little bit rustic and organic e
so that's the theme that I've gone for
I've also got a snowflake hole punch
again from Amazon I'll leave all of this
stuff linked down below and of course
you can use doddle to get your others
and parcels to live it as well so you
don't need to worry about missing any in
a mad rush before Christmas
also from Amazon I got some red and
white twine I thought that looked quite
festive and to go with the organic theme
I've also got some I think this is
called folk of the word has completely
escaped me but it's almost like a burlap
sack material made of ribbon or ribbon
made of that sack material so I just got
quite a few little odd bits and bobs and
then also some ink and some Christmas
stamps that say hohoho and Merry
Christmas so this is pretty much what
I'm going to be using for wrapping so
I'm going to start I think I'm going to
let myself in easily by starting off
with the purse so the most important
thing for getting a perfectly neatly
wrapped present is by not using too much
so measure it out really carefully you
only need an inch either side and then
you should be good to go
so I've popped my purse on the wrapping
paper I've got about an inch either side
and then I'm just going to flip it over
so I know exactly how much paper I need
don't use any more because it's just a
waste and it'll just add bulk to your
wrapping so without doubt the best thing
to use is double-sided sticky tape
because then you can't see it at all but
if you don't have any in the house and
just use normal sticky tape or just
don't go too overboard with it because
that looks a little bit messy once
you've done your wrapping you should be
left with a really plain canvas so you
really can get creative here what I'm
gonna do is start with the label I'm
actually gonna do a really cool little
candy cane trick which you guessed it I
found on Pinterest is so easy let me
show you
simply take your scissors and definitely
use like a magazine or a cup roof mat if
you've got one and then to score two
parallel lines on your gift tag and then
just pop your candy cane through the
hole so now that I've got my tag I'm
just going to take some of this wired
gold ribbon and do a beautiful big bow
over the puzzle
when you've perfected your bow then I'm
gonna take some of my red white wine
just to add my gift tag
and then we have my first wrapped gift
may not be quite as good as the ones on
Pinterest but hey hoo I think it looks
really pretty and the candy cane on the
gift tag just gives it a little bit of
an edge so now I'm going to attempt to
wrap the earmuffs this is going to be
really challenging not too sure how I'm
going to manage this actually but let's
give it a go okay so what I'm gonna do
in this instance where my wrapping
clearly is not as good as it could be
I'm going to go all out with decorations
to hopefully try to detract the eye so
I've got my candy cane and my red and
white twine and next what I'm going to
do is take my snowflake stamp on my
white ink and just cover the rest of the
craft paper that's visible in little
snowflakes and then I've also got my 3d
snowflakes from white company just to
add another depth to it
okay so here we have my two perfectly
wrapped Christmas gifts I hope this has
given you guys some ideas of how you can
wrap your own Christmas gift and I
really hope you enjoyed looking through
