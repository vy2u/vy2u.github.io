a winter morning get ready with me but
with a bit of a twist I don't know about
you but during these cold dark winter
mornings I often really struggle with
the lighting when doing my makeup in the
morning I'm often up and out of the
house before 8 a.m. so more often than
not it's dark and I'm doing my makeup
which can cause all kinds of problems
I often leave the house check my
reflection in the mirror and I'm
horrified to see bronzer spread all over
my face I've got dodgy eyeshadow and my
blending is just way off for this video
I've worked at IKEA who have provided me
with some product solutions to help
create the perfect lighting setup for
doing my makeup so now let's cut to the
get ready with me and see what Edgar the
interior design from Ikea has
recommended for me so to create an even
illumination around my face I've gone
for two light bulbs either side of the
mirror to make sure that the light is
reflecting evenly to ensure that my
blending is incredibly smooth I've gone
for the photo globes which are solid
glass which means I'm going to get a
really even lighting effect as opposed
to having a patterned lampshade which
can create really unflattering patterns
and shadows on my face I also love that
these are really lovely flattering warm
color you want to avoid any fluorescent
colored bulbs because these create
really cold lighting which is incredibly
unflattering and can lead you to putting
on a little bit too much makeup which we
don't want we also want to avoid having
any lighting above the mirror because
then this causes some shadows underneath
the eyes which once again is a little
bit unflattering if you don't have room
for two lampshades on your dressing
table you could also go for a floor lamp
I've gone for the swivel which has two
different lamp shades which means I can
really control the lighting with my
makeup application I want to create a
really beautiful illuminated base so I'm
going for the darf and Lumiere essential
moisturizer to start with and just
applying that evenly all over my skin
so the moisturizer has got little oil
particles in it which really help to
just give a natural glow to the skin but
without being too heavy next because I
want to ensure that my makeup lasts all
day long I'm using a primer and this
helps to prepare my skin for perfect
long-lasting makeup application I'm
using my giorgio armani luminous silk
foundation for a really beautiful base
and blending with my Mara Hoffman makeup
brush which I got from Sephora because
of the nature of the bulbs my face is
illuminated from all angles which means
I don't get any of those dodgy lines or
marks underneath my chin which makes
blending so much easier on those dark
cold mornings to hide any blemishes I'm
going in with the benefit born concealer
this is an industrial-strength concealer
so it can hide all kinds of marks on the
face
because of the lovely warm natural color
that I'm getting from the Globes it
means that I know the exact perfect
shade of concealer for me so when I go
outside there won't be any nasty
surprises from bad blending or bad color
choices and then I'm making sure all the
makeup stays in place with my HD powder
the glass around the bulbs almost acts
like a softbox so it's a really
flattering light which means I don't
need to go overboard on any of my powder
to end up looking cakey when I finish
doing my makeup I'm using my Urban Decay
brow beta as usual just to fill in any
gaps in my brows and then I'm just going
to set them in place and finish with my
benefit gimme brow I recently
rediscovered my Stila eyeshadow palette
and it's filled with the most beautiful
shades at this time of year so I think
I'm going to go for a slightly sparkly
brown smokey eye today
and I'm just going to make sure there
are no harsh lines by blending it in
with my zoeva brush to create a slightly
more defined look I'm going to go in
with a brown eyeliner this is the
Charlotte Tilbury Kohl eyeliner I find
Brown a little bit more soft and natural
than black so perfect for an everyday
makeup look because the lamp shades
around they also reflect light off the
walls so no matter where I position
myself the lighting is perfectly even
all over my face
and then for big bold lashes I'm going
in with my Elizabeth Arden show-stopping
mascara
next I'm moving back to the base and
this is where the good lighting really
comes in because I'm going to be
applying bronzer and I definitely don't
want to be going overboard with this but
I'm using my deal skin nude just to
really highlight the cheekbone area
create a little bit of contour but also
add some warmth to the complexion and
I'm making sure this is really evenly
blended all down my jawline and on to
the neck too and add a beautiful glow to
my complexion I'm also going to use a
highlight and blush from a Tom Ford
palette
and to finish I'm using my favorite lip
product from the past couple of weeks
it's a zoeva pure bellows lips in the
shade clear message
so this is my finished makeup look
perfectly blended thanks to my new
lighting setup professional makeup
lighting can often be hard to achieve
with hard wiring and often an
electrician required whereas with this
setup I easily set it up myself and
really affordably too so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and thanks to IKEA

lighting setup all the information about
the products and lights used will be

makeup I often need to be up to anything
