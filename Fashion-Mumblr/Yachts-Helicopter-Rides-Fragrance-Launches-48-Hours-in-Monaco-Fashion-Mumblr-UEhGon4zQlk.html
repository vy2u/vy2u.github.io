may I say welcome back because it's been
a couple of days since I last daily
vlogs but honestly this baggage is going
to make up for it so we are at the hotel
Emma Tosh now in Monaco and Charlie over
there and I are here as guests of Azara
which is a men's fragrance brand and
last night was absolutely mental so we
landed back from Sicily at 2 o'clock
this morning got home and had one hours
sleep or 45 minutes on my case and then
flew to Monaco we've just checked into
the hotel just got changed and we're now
heading it to the coast for some lunch
and this hotel is so beautiful I'll give
you a brief tour when we get back yeah
so back to daily vlogging and I can't
wait to show you the rest of this trip
because our itinerary is insane click
outfit of the day I just got changed
super quick after lunch I'm wearing a
little French Connection dress Valentino
bag which does not go and my little dune
shoes
so we have come up to the pool deck on
the top of the hotel and it's so
beautiful up here we've got a little
outdoor hot tub which we're going to
chill in now over the king at the marina
which you can see behind me how is it
darling okay listen got a little manic
since I last vlog we were up by the pool
and then I was rushing to get ready I
was filming I get ready with me which is
always a little bit stressful in the
wild do this myself but we're ready to
go now I'm getting with her on the way
too
we survived the helicopter ride Valley
we did I mean I don't see it yeah
Hollywood screaming let go a little bit
no a leisurely amazing
we have arrived again and they are here
at a shorter time is actually that's a
very nice hotel good quality to make
more than you as our Oh fragrances are
awarded and I will show you also anyway
very good morning it is day two in
Monaco Charlie and I just had a really
lovely breakfast and we're about half an
hour early for the meeting this morning
so just a little yes Charlie got elected
wise seagull at breakfast
tell him what happened I'm just eating
breakfast casually and then I heard
landed on what a massive bird it was
huge but lying on my shoulder is Nick my
salmon I wish I'd caught it on camera
because it was quite comical and so yeah
we're just having a little stroll around
now near our hotel we just went to a
nice little view points and yeah just
having a wonder and twenty minutes
before we head to meet the guys and
we're going on a yacht cruise later so
so that should be rather fast so this is
where we're going to spending the day
today our own private yacht go for a
j-dog
so we are now aboard the sorrows yachts
we're just leaving
Oliver Bay or is an article of cortical
Montecarlo Bay we're spending the next
three hours going for a little bit
cruise around all different colors
through my paint can
I think we'll go as far as such me but
yeah
luring the yacht pretend Olivia so I
haven't picked up the flocking camera in
a little while but we've spent most of
the afternoon one of the Azzaro yachts
which was really really fabulous no
lunch on there and then we show time
together when it was in the bay and now
we are nice yeah not blurry it's called
which is a cocktail bar on the beach and
we're just chilling and enjoying
sunshine finished getting ready for
dinner
feeling a lot more fresh now I've
showered and redone my makeup I was
getting rather hot and sweaty earlier
and we had a really fab afternoon that
we went after the yacht to a beach club
oh my god and we saw sausage dog puppies
they were the cutest things in the whole
world i snapchatted them and ahh it was
so cute I just could not could not stop
kissing them and then we had the shock
of our lives when we got the bill
because them well I'd heard that Monaco
is expensive but I was not quite
expecting full Sun Loungers for towels
and for cocktails to come to 150 euros
so yes Monaco is very expensive and so
yeah we are just about to head upstairs
to dinner we're going to dinner and on
the roof of our hotel there's a
restaurant out there which probably is a
really fab restaurant I'm not sure what
it's called but I'll show you in a
second
and it's just going to be the four of us
Lydia Ali myself and Charlie because the
girls from Clarins have gone now they
are heading back to England
and but they have been so amazing
honestly Ali and Romina have just been
like the best hostesses for this trip
nothing
been too much of a problem or just
they've just done everything for example
Lydia was saying she sometimes gets a
bit travel sick on boats and before he
knew a tally had popped out and got her
some tablets from a nearby cameras like
they are just the best girls in the
world so if you're watching thank you
guys so much you have been amazing we've
had such a fab time um
Charlie's has gone to Nick a pair of
chinos from Ali's room so hopefully
he'll be back
oh that's him now and we're going to
head up for dinner we are now strolling
through the street on one or are they
looking for like where to find some
cocktails we had a really fabulous
dinner at the hotel
