really well and had a fabulous weekend
so now I don't usually upload on Mondays
but this Monday is extra special because
I'm launching my fashion mumbler spring
edit for 2017 if you guys have been
watching my videos for a little while
you may remember that I did a spring
edit last year and I have to say it was
probably my favorite collection of
videos I absolutely adore spring it's my
favorite season my favorite time of the
year I love all the colors first of all
the blossom gourd has a bizarre been so
TV and but I just love the fashion and
all the trends in particular at this
time of year once again I'm going to be
doing a spring edit to celebrate that
and really inject some spring into my
youtube channel so stick around for the
rest of this week if you'd like to see
lots of spring videos ranging from my
favorite spring trends a spring
drugstore makeup tutorial sprinkles
spring design and bag unboxing there's
going to be so much fabulous stuff
coming over the next five or six days
depending on how many videos I have
chance to film so please make sure
you're subscribed if you are excited for
lots of spring and business I also have
a little bit more travel content coming
up in the next week from my trip to the
Maldives so yeah definitely make sure
you click that subscribe button and the
little bell if you would like to choose
keep up to date with all of those sostay
videos to kick things off is going to be
a spring zara haul and I've actually
never done a thorough haul on my channel
before I do shop in Zara quite a lot but
more bit-by-bit
never really calling from Zara but as
it's spring it's really the time of year
that I get very excited over newness in
the shop and I was searching with a
colony of the day so them that with so
many pieces and I made a fairly big
order I thought I would share it with
you here on my channel second reason why
I probably never featured star before is
because actually I find their customer
service so bad every time I need or
enter the shop I just get really angry
for some reason or another I think
everybody on the planet has a zara
customer
so this horror story if he do doesn't
leave in the comments below but yeah I
have I have so many times where I've
gone in there and I've just been
appalled back to customer service and
specially if someone they used to work
in retail I just I know through service
I see it and I don't see it in that so I
think that that I made my orderings
Ericom I didn't have to go into the
store also I feel like I don't really
see that many Zara halls on YouTube you
see tons of a thoughtful sub shop calls
but not many Zara hauls I don't know
that maybe because you cheese's don't
earn affiliate revenue from the borrowed
maybe that's me being skeptical and yeah
you don't see that many so I thought I
would share with you why I picked up in
Big Springs are a whole without any
further ado let's get started right so
I've got two boxes from Zara one of them
and extortionate you heavy and one of
them is super light so I'm going to
start off by opening the light ones
let's see what's inside
okay so we've got the box our boxes are
made with boxes past well done Zara
recycling and inside if we open it up is
some tissue paper to actually come more
nicely presented than a Topshop order
for example where everything is in its
plastic wrap a little bit more nice to
open so inside this box are the two bags
that I ordered for Masse's our website
especially larger things like bags and
shoes I definitely first buy them online
and install because I wouldn't really
want to carry this in the shopping bag
around town with me how gorgeous is this
I think this is one of the pieces that
actually spurred me on to make the
purchase I don't about you but I often
fill my basket on all kinds of websites
but it takes one piece that I really
want to actually make the purchase and
this to me was it I just think this
looks so high-end it was actually $49.99
so not cheap it's not like a terribly
affordable bag but definitely
I think it looks a lot more expensive
basket style bags are going to be so big
this year and I just think it is so
plastic if it had a little logo on it it
would not surprise me if it was like
Chanel or something like that it's such
an elegant timeless design but this
giant gold buckle if I guess you press
it in and then this leather surface real
leather probably not at that price will
have it smells quite real and then
inside it opens up its shoe she opens if
you look at that it's very very spacious
inside it's almost like two halves I
guess because it's basket that's pretty
much the only way it could work but yeah
really spacious inside you've got a
shoulder strap again in the white screen
leather
you've got a tiny little pouch here and
then eight fabrics remaining I just
think this is going to look so gorgeous
in the summer if you go to anything's
like any rate seas or in beach days and
if you've got any nice holidays coming
up can imagine wearing this is a really
cute like ID for outfits if you're going
anywhere shop cool Morocco or going to
crush it quite hard to shop on it's
actually really hard to shop it'll work
there we go yeah I think it's so
beautiful I actually quite liked it as a
handheld as opposed to a strap on it but
yeah I thought this was absolutely
gorgeous
that's probably started off in my
favorite piece but thank you so this is
one that I almost bought for comparison
it's another basket bag it comes in a
ginormous dust bag this one actually
reminds me of something we used to have
in our old house we kind of kept drive
by Lisbon but it's quite unusual this
more reminds me of like a safari kind of
bag I think I mean imagine going on
holiday to like Kenya or something and
having a really cool bag like this with
all your essentials in so it's got a
pop-up to open it up you've got faux
leather straps and then inside it's got
the stripe material we've got this super
long strap and then it's just like a
really big Spacey area I guess the only
restriction would be are your items
small enough to fit in here because
obviously it's George won't have any
the movement and then yeah it just
closes like that I thought this was very
cute very unusual price-wise $39.99 so
10 pound cheaper than the other bag I
think I do prefer the other one but for
the unusual factor I think just going to
do is really cool a lot easier to
clothes let me know what you think size
in the client which is your favorite I
probably will only keep one so yeah let
me know returning for fun and that's
everything that was in the light box
just those two bags so now we have the
heavy one I think this is going to be
mostly clothing maybe one pair of shoes
I can't quite remember okay we are in
let's box number two and we have lots of
gorgeous items in here oh my goodness
ah I forgot how much fun does this on
the website so this is a beautiful oh my
goodness I'm so excited weather's
beautiful white coats and the sleeves
are like effusive clean so you guys you
know my obsession with sleeves and the
trend for exaggerated please luckily is
going nowhere anytime soon as I was
absolutely delighted when I spotted a
classic elegant feminine white coat with
fluted sleeves on as Ericom it's a
gorgeous material it is going to get
foundation all over it I can already
tell and potentially lipstick and dog
hairs and all that job but I think it's
worth it
such a gorgeous shape it's a straight
up-and-down silhouette it's got pockets
which a line is sort of polyester lining
this kind of coat I have had the style
similar to this from Zara before in the
past and you can simply tuck them in the
washing machine and they look good as
new when they come out so you go into
two pressures with it I'm going to show
you some clips of me trying this on now
because I don't need me holding it out
is doing it any justice and it's just so
fabulous this coat is dreamy
I just adore this sleeve detail it's so
me definitely would not wear with a
cream top and the needs of heaven trying
on other bits from the hall the way that
it hangs is just gorgeous I love the
pocket detail you can make it really
casual and just something a little bit
unusual
and compared to the normal coat style
really really nice for me I have
slightly broader than average shoulders
and it just fits really beautifully
around here it's quite tailored and then
it just hangs down beautifully it's not
not tailored on the body just more
tailored around the shoulders I like
that it doesn't have a collar either
it's a very simple neckline very elegant
very timeless totally rounder on
clothing underneath it um but hopefully
you get a picture long
so the coat is $79.99 which i guess is
on a par with River Island and Topshop
kind of coats and it does feel
beautifully made the seams are really
well finished off the fabric quality is
really lovely and if it's anything like
Zara coats I've tried in the past
hopefully and have a really beautiful
hang to it so really impressed with this
one and I think a passable coloured or
light coat in anyone's spring wardrobe
is such a gorgeous essential it should
actually received a couple of comments
in a recent whole video saying that
everything I bought was white or pink
they all my favorite colors I don't
really wear black thought about it
but it's like as you're Fanning then
maybe my holes are not for you if you
like bright feminine romantic soft
pastel colors and you're in the right
place
talking of which my next item is also on
the white spectrum can't tell what it is
yet because it's really confusing this
is one I'm definitely gonna have to show
you try it on because it doesn't look
very exciting at all I think it's like a
cross over top do not remember ordering
this $25.99 I'm just going to straight
away cut me trying it on because this
looks like a rag so this top is quite a
strange one Tyrell if I don't think I'm
going to get a lot of use out of it or
wear out of it it's very kind of hippie
peasant style is the best way that I
would describe it it's quite strange how
it falls it's very risky with the
cleavage penciling flatten out it
doesn't matter you can though I have to
say and I do like the material although
it could be quite creepy
yeah you've got this string that goes
down the middle you can always tie this
any lab I tried in the middle but you
know I don't know I guess it's something
a little bit more slim fitting than
these trousers it could look quite cool
quite Miss Lillian bish let me know in
the comments if you get that reference
but yeah I wish I'd had this before in
genetics it kind of looks quite cool on
my trip but some undecided isn't really
recent this next piece is really fun
obviously for some reason we are all
totally obsessed with avocados at best
avocado on rye bread this morning
Charlie and I bought some little special
digression like baby sprouts from
Sainsbury's and put them on the tops are
may be inserted here yeah it was
delicious so anyway this top has
avocados on it which is the point I was
getting at it's a blue cotton shirt got
a really cool back detail it's got like
an open back with almost a bow effect
the seeds have also got bows on the hem
which just is such a cute almost like
kitschy prairie style and then you've
got avocado bananas and I'm not sure
what that serve fruit is don't really
know I feel closer you can let me know
if you know what fruit that's meant to
be but yeah those fruits are embroidered
all over it and just - this is so
hilariously to you I think this material
is really lovely for summertime as well
not really a layering piece because of
the open back but any summer holidays
all those beautiful moon days that we
get here in the UK I think this is just
so fun and price-wise I don't believe as
much more than 25 pounds but oh here we
go
yes $25.99 so not too bad for a really
tall order P obviously I would never
wear the avocado top with the pearl
jeans um but just to show you the effect
of the top such a lovely material I
really like the casualness of these
bowtie sleeves
really really nice the only issue I have
with it is how high the neck is I feel
like I'm kind of wearing a bib which is
not what the look that I wanted to go
for very very high neck but having said
that it is a tie at the back here and so
I potentially could tie a little bit
looser the bow detail looks really cool
- quite selective us what Brora war with
it I do love it I think it's a really
fun statement piece but it could have
been done a little bit better I feel
shocked Caro we have some pink in my
Hall and this is a pair of high-waisted
full-length trousers so I think that
high-waisted long leg trousers should
look so elegant and lady night and this
is a really lucky material it's not
expensive to be honest you can even end
up spending a fortune on this kind
childr these were $29.99 but I feel that
they're going to look so much more
expensive than that I picked these up in
the hope that they're going to be really
well fitted around the waist because
then that's so flattering if like me you
have quite short legs then something
like this that's incredibly high waisted
the crotch area is here so that entire
area is going to be leg lengthening and
lusion area pyramid your legs is a lot
longer I think it looks absolutely
gorgeous this in particular I will wear
with a silk desktop in a white or cream
color maybe even gray as our gray can
look really gorgeous or blouse just
really lightweight materials I think
that if you're traveling if it also is
your boat any countries where you have
to be mindful or if you have to be going
to a mosque or anywhere that requires
you to do something that requires each
have your legs covered then something
lightweight like this when water can
come in really handy so extractors try
these on and yeah I think you be seeing
me wearing these an awful lot in the
coming weeks and months as the weather
warms up a little bit
thank goodness these trousers fit so
perfectly they are the absolute right
size around my waist really well fitted
a little bit of room but you know I can
still enjoy summer BBQs and not have to
worry that my trousers being too tight
this is the bag in action looks so cute
with this color palette and such a nice
size you can see the trousers are quite
sheer so you may need to think about
what top you wear with the trousers I'm
just wearing this classic silk vest top
which is from Reese I just think that
things like this in your wardrobe you
will wear over and over again I highly
recommend investing in a silk blouse
especially if your style is similar to
mine
this is the kind of thing I wear
absolutely load and looks so gorgeous
with these trousers the color of the
trousers it is beautiful
yeah but it is a little bit sheer so no
for us an underwear lengthwise really
great especially if your legs are quite
short like mine I paired with some mules
these are actually also from Reis but I
think equally with some sandals they
look absolutely beautiful and the zip is
on the side so nice easy entry access so
yeah big big fan of these trousers
really pleased with those there's next
piece I bought with the intention of it
being one of those bits you can kind of
just throw on and know if you've got an
instant outfit but looking at it now it
just looks a little bit dull $25.99 I
got this price small this is a great
jumper dress I love drama dresses purely
because of the ease it's really mindless
dressing you don't have to make any
decisions only what accessories and
shoes to wear but what makes this grey
dress a little bit more exciting is the
fact that it does have this frill at the
bottom so you can see there so it should
hopefully flare out and have a really
feminine kick to it so I will try this
on now fabric wise it feels really nice
and soft it's not got any cashmere in it
at this price but it does feel really
lovely so hopefully it fits in all the
right places there the dress is
obviously really really relaxed it feels
incredibly comfortable I've just popped
it on with my Nicolas Kirkwood gold
shoes which I'm totally obsessed with I
really like this thrill at the bottom
it's probably going to need quite a lot
of ironing I think this is going to
crease quite badly but it's so
comfortable I think if you want to look
chic well you're just relaxing at home
then this is a gorgeous one equally if
you are doing any traveling and then
this is a really nice traveling outfit I
think for a relaxed very comfortable
summer day dress this is actually really
a cute if you like getting your legs out
as well and but still want to be cozy
then yeah this dress is really growing
on me actually I like the neckline as
well it's nice if you've got any jewelry
on I like the length of the sleeve yes
I like this a lot more than I thought I
would actually next up something else is
white sorry not sorry
it is this beautiful blouse and what
makes this glass so special is the hems
on the sleeves or the cuffs you could
say so I am insert a close-up but as you
can see they have almost like shells
diamante pearly bit frosty crystals are
not real quirky which just gives it a
really gorgeous detail holiday peace UK
summer looking fabulous and gorgeous
peace for once again on holiday covering
out your shoulders to be a little bit
more sexual order to share so be careful
on that and but yeah I just think this
is such a lovely classic wardrobe piece
I think that everybody just looks so
beautiful and in light weight flowers
like this a really good order of sensual
and then at the front it's got is not
detailed as well so it finishes down at
the bottom with a knot hopefully the
neckline is going to have a bit of a
waterfall effects but once again really
needs to be tried on show the sort of
sex so let's cut and try on so the knots
on this top falls quite low down so
you'd have to be quite careful with what
trousers you decided to wear with it the
wrist the cuff detail is just absolutely
beautiful I'm obsessed with this detail
it's so beautiful and I just feel like
it's a really lovely relaxed fit I think
it looks incredibly expensive and I'd
love anyone will get this but I feel
like it's the kind of thing that a
wealthy Italian would wear and I feel
like Italians they just exude this
incredible elegance they don't really
look like they're trying you can tell
their outfits are just stunning and a
beautiful probably boutique designer I
don't know it just kind of gives me
those vibes so let me know if you if you
feel the same way I think it's so lovely
definitely a some holiday peace or a
very lovely occasion in the UK if you
have a very elegant work style then
perhaps this would be a good one for you
as well and yeah nice one Doris this
next piece is really fun I'm always
looking for ways to jab at my jeans and
I spotted this pair with pearls all over
them
there was a pair on a sauce with pearls
on and I'm thinking about buying them I
had them on their wishes for a while and
then the leather featured them in and
let those videos that they sold out I
was really happy to see is are bringing
out their own pair this is the vintage
straight crop mid cut passives are a
premium collection
these were $39.99 I mean you can't even
get a pair of Topshop Jamie for that
price and I got the signs at 34 waist
the hips Calif it looks quite small in
your crop and you've only got the pearls
on the front not on that which is great
so they probably just fall off and I
feel a bit disappointed that the hands
are properly finished I feel like if
you're going to be cool enough to put
pearls on your jeans we're going to want
to have ragged frayed hands so if these
look great I think I'm going to chop the
hands off and just fray them a little
bit to give them that really nice effect
so yeah hopefully do six fingers crossed
let's get my shine okay so I'm not too
sure how I feel about the trousers I
love the idea of them with the poles but
they are very wide at the bottom they're
kind of 60 - with this flare down at the
bottom I feel like I may try and tailor
them myself so they're a little bit more
slimline in that kind of way
excuse the topper really does not go
with them but I do love how high-waisted
they are I think they could be really
flattering and very waist extenuate
accentuating with the right top I like
the color of the denim as well there's
so much I like about them and I'm really
determined to make them work so let me
know if you'd like to see me tailoring
these because I think I might do a bit
of a DIY job the final two pieces I
picked up from Zara calm our shoes and
first of all we have this pair of
sandals I just adore pearls as you get
from trousers and pearls are another
trends that we're really going to be
seen emerging throughout spring and
summer this year this pair of flip-flops
or sandals are $39.99 they are black and
I know I should header I don't worry
black but you won't really see how much
black when you're wearing them how
I am bad look and you've got pearls over
these three straps different sized
pearls I don't know if even pearl
overkill to wear as a jeans but you can
give it a try anyway I think it'll look
so nice when you've got slightly tanned
feet as well like even my hand through
that I feel just looks really lovely
you've got Chrome on the heel which just
adds a really nice edge considering has
40 pounds this is why I love Zara I hate
to love it but I do they just bring out
the most beautiful things another thing
I love about Zara is that so quick to
respond to trend this I think is the key
to their success they have the shortest
catwalk to carry a bio system across the
whole High Street across the whole world
they're able to respond to trends so
quickly they often put things like this
in the store in very small portions in
like flagship stores such as the Oxford
Street store and if they sell well then
because their system is so quick they
can easily create hundreds and thousands
more to send designs so often you'll see
something come in and it'll go and then
a few weeks later it'll be back in its
masses if I feel like this might be an
example of that
after you love these I feel like they're
going to be the kind of thing that I
reach for over and over again
I'll get those another month last but
not least another pair of shoes these
are a more classic I know depend not
that classic actually I forgot about
this so they are these mules kind of
mules sandals with a dial on face
pineapple I think that's so fun this
section is very silky I'm definitely not
silk so it could be actually $49.99
so I'm guessing you're paying more for
the embroidery but anyway this feels
like silk frothy polyester and then
you've got this diamond embroidery and
embroidery Scott New Zealand diamante
embellishment of the pineapples on the
shoe I think these are so fun great for
like sliders if you are going to feature
them or at the pool or something like
that I really hope I can find a way why
I'm using UK I feel like that's slightly
more holidays I think the color these
are gorgeous or like the champagne color
and that same material good all the way
around the edges they feel really good
quality sometimes bizarre it's a little
bit
this but I have to say I'm really
impressed with the quality of everything
they've picked up and pulled so far or
together because this is life it yeah I
think it's a really really beautiful and
I'm going to divide by the four fingers
cause they're comfortable they should be
quite a lot of flexibility that so
that's everything that I picked up from
Zara in my recent order I literally made
this order two days ago got it on next
day delivery and you're going to see
this video one day after I filming it
yes from this day and so everything
should still be on zara website I
believe direct links do everything down
below as usual so you can shop them if
you like
so really hope you guys enjoyed this
horrible the first desirable and my

any more videos and featuring Zara bits
and bobs I know that globally everybody
