going to be a Zara haul and it's going

and loads of fashion content coming your
way this week if you don't want to miss
any then please do hit subscribe button
down below we're kicking things off with
Zara and I find as our as a really good
place to start when you're looking for
new season trends because they tend to
take up on the trend really really
quickly and they have a very quick
turnaround from catwalk to High Street
so Zara's probably the one that has the
most autumnal trend pieces in at the
moment this whole week obviously we're
in a very weird time of view at the
moment it is still technically summer
here in the UK in fact it should be the
peak of summer but as it is today we're
getting a lot of gray rainy days so
we're always starting to think about
autumn so for the whole is this whole
week most of the holes are going to be
transitional pieces starting to either
send it to autumnal we're also before I
get started just to let you know how
these holes are going to work I'm going
to doing a try on haul for every single
video this week and everything that you
see in all of the halls will always be
linked down in the description box below
so just click show more and you'll see
not only links to where you can buy the
pieces I'm mentioning the halls but also
bits and bobs that I'm wearing this
jumpers lipstick my jewelry will all be
linked down below even stuff in a
background like simmer and rails so any
information that you want from the
videos just check in the description box
okie dokie so today we are kicking off
whole week with Zara and I visited these
are on Regent Street I find that's a
really good one it has a great mix of
pieces and doesn't have terribly bad
customer service normally I just get
quite angry and Farah but that one in
the kingsroad one I don't find too bad
so let's get straight stuck in there
I'll show you what I picked up this
first piece I have actually already worn
and tried on and I featured in a
lookbook which we're coming your way
very soon it is this autumnal
coloured maxi dress it does have a slip
inside which used to be attached but I
actually pulled it out because the
straps on the slip dress which and this
color is going
I mean really really handy the struts
are far too long so is showing my bra
and I pulled it out so that I remember
to cut these straps and make them a
little bit shorter because I'm not
adjustable but the dress has come with
this new pink slip which is going to
come in very very handy and I always
keep slips like that in my wardrobe the
dress itself is this gorgeous kind of
like Forney green color I've even still
got the sleeves inside out bear with me
taking this off in a rush but I thought
these colors were really beautiful
obviously is quite sure as you can see
but when you have got something on
underneath it it's the most beautiful I
would call this like a really earthy
green and then you've got these very
rich colored flowers all the way
throughout the dress for a cinched in
waist which is created with this smoking
effect and then you've also got the
smoking on the sleeves as well so you
can either have this dress as a full
length long sleeve or you could really
pull them up and create a bit of a
balloon and sleeve effect which is very
much in trend at the moment
next wise this one comes to kind of
halfway between my ankle and my knees or
mid calf area which is definitely the
length of the season for this autumn
winter coming up I did actually do a
video yesterday on Sunday which is all
about autumn winter 2017 trends to be
aware of and I mentioned
midi-length maxi dresses some incense
mini lengths maxi dresses you guys know
I mean I mentioned that was one of the
trends look out for so if you do want to
walk up on the upcoming trends and I'll
leave that video linked here and also
down the description box so definitely
check that one out but yeah this was
actually the piece it was on a mannequin
that drew me into the store and led to
my vehicles so big fan of that one this
next piece is actually another key
autumn trend in that it contains
fringing it's a suede effect jacket and
I just absolutely loved our jackets I
find them really good for like
transitional time of year especially
because they're not hugely worn but they
do is give you plenty of covering this
one as you can see it is gorgeous like
stony color and then you've got the
fringing hanging from the sleeves which
is a really nice effect absolutely adore
this color it's so nice this time of
year especially when you do want
something around your shoulders is cute
a little bit warmer in the evenings in
the daytime but you're not ready for a
full-on coaches yet has got a zipper all
the way from the bottom to the top that
yeah absolutely
love this coat really gorgeous color and
and lots of wear outfits next up is a
blouse and just because it's autumn
winter does not mean I'll be ditching
the pink any time soon this is a dusky
pink which i think is a really lovely
way of wearing pink in the autumn if
like me you're also not ready to say
goodbye to pink I picked this up in an
extra-small everything unless I state
otherwise it's going to be in the
smallest size possible and I normally
find Zara extra small it's a good size
for me this has is kind of like a silky
material and then it's got a pea pattern
that's kind of been ironed on that
fairly sheer but I don't think you'd
need a specific size top underneath
obviously if you want a little bit of
extra warmth then a vest wouldn't go
amiss but it's really not too sheer when
it's not being held up against white I
picked this one up with it in my mind
that I was going to wear it with a
high-waisted suede skirt white trousers
it would also look really lovely with
and also as a layering piece you imagine
this with maybe associate further
juillet that's another trend we're gonna
be seeing a lot of this coming season
and a big wide belts cinch everything in
I thought that'd be a really lovely way
of adding a bit of a kind of boho granny
trench into your wardrobe so this piece
was actually styled with that blouse in
store and I thought it was collapse but
actually it's a skirt so this is again
the lush pink skirt it does have an
asymmetric hem which is another of
autumns trends and it looks like it's
going to fit really nicely around the
waist got quite a lot of darts in there
so hopefully fairly figure-hugging and
by the way this one of them in 1999 it's
a really nice way of injecting a little
bit more femininity into your wardrobe
without spending too much money you nice
and affordable and then this is a really
great transitional piece it is a t-shirt
but it's made with a really lovely thick
almost like a woolen material it feels
really cozy and it's covered in pearls
which I just thought was a really lovely
design detail this one was $25.99 a
little bit more pricey but still very
affordable and you know when you go into
a store and you pick something up and
you just know that it's a kind of piece
you're going to wear so so so much it's
going to be one of those pieces are
reach for on many occasions it's so
comfy that I can imagine myself working
from home wearing this with some really
cozy jeans
perhaps if you work in an office and you
want something a little bit more cash
for dress-down Fridays or if your office
has
more of a relaxed vibe to it then this
is just a really super piece I think
it's really great for those days and
it's cold outside but yet your office
has heating so yeah really nice
transitional piece that I will
definitely be wearing a lot and then the
last clothing piece that I picked up was
this pair of jeans I find those are
jeans fit me really well they are very
good quality full price these again
$25.99 I got them in a size 34 waist and
they're pretty clean jeans and they do
have quite an interesting hem and I'm
really obsessed with having detail at
the moment hems are a really good way of
them just differentiating your jeans
from the usual straight up and down so
this almost has like a double Freight
hem which I think should be a really
nice design detail high-waisted as well
high waisted skinny jeans is never going
to going out of style and yeah I just
find us our jeans they have a great
elasticity content they fit really
beautifully and they don't fade or lose
their elasticity the more you wear them
so a big big fans of zara denim and then
finally and this is a piece I'm so so
happy with absolutely adore these I got
this set of earrings with the little
Leafs on them I said it's all quite big
but they are very nice I always really
worry about wearing anything that could
be too heavy I like to wear it like
studs or small things most the time but
I think in winter if you have got
clothing up to your neck especially a
high roll neck or a high neck jumper
like like something along these lines
then it is really nice to accessorize
with something on your ears especially a
statement earring perhaps a big chunky
necklace but I'm more of an earring
person than a chunky metal person at the
moment I prefer to keep my necklaces
quite delicate so for something like
this claim-jumper very chic and perhaps
having her hair up in a chignon or messy
bun this would just look absolutely
lovely
they were also only $9.99 if it was
really good I think across the UK high
street you can barely get any earrings
from $9.99 instead of this lovely and I
think that if you told someone that
these were already expensive like from
Nessa totally on something they would
probably believe you so big big fan of
those and that's everything that I
picked up in my pre autumn transitional
Laurel
hope you guys really enjoyed looking
through those pieces of me I'm very very
happy with everything that I picked up
and I think I'll be getting a lot of use
out of them I'd love to know what autumn
transy you guys are most looking forward
to so let me know in the comments below
what trends you're excited to wear or if
there are any way you've seen it'll
really not going to be taking part in at
all but I feel like these pieces are
really wearable with a touch of trend
and trend lettuce in there as well so
yeah pretty happy with my bits and bobs
