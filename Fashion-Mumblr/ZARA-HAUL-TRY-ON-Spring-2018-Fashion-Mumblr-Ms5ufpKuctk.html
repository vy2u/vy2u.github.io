part of the fashion mumbler spring edit
if you are new here then welcome and you
are joining me during my favorite season
of the year spring and to celebrate I
have got a whole week of spring themed
videos going up this week as part of the
spring edit so we've got how to update
your wardrobe for spring at lots of
different halls I've got makeup routines
how to style trend videos all that kind
of thing I'll leave all the videos in
the fashion month of spring edit linked
down below as you can catch up on any
that you may have missed out on but
today we're going to be doing a czar a
haul actually technically a Zara and
mango haul because I feel like Zara and
mango to me they're very similar
retailers are always pretty much next to
each other on the high street and they
have a very similar vibe so I'm going to
share with you bits I've picked up from
both retailers in today's video as with
all of my videos everything that you see
in this video including what I'm wearing
what I've been buying even what's in the
background will be linked down below so
for any information just click show more
and you'll find it all there so I'm
gonna get started with what I have
bought from Zara okay so this doesn't
look like a terribly huge bag that there
are quite a lot of pieces inside and
I've taken a few of the larger items out
already Charlie and I are going into
Mexico in a couple of weeks time so a
lot of these pieces are very much
inspired by that trip and how I want my
Instagram to look during that trip I
very much want it to be quite like a
rustic feel and you'll see the kind of
vibe I'm going for when you see the
pieces I've picked up so let's start
with this top here this one I actually
saw on a mannequin in the shop window
and immediately I was like yep that is
exactly the kind of vibe I want to be
going for in Mexico but equally here in
the UK when the temperatures start to
warm up a lot more I've always loved
Bardo tops and I just really like how
kind of rule this one is the material
that looks like linen it's a very
natural looking material very simple
stitch detail around the edge that's
literally the only detail on this top
the hems have been very loosely finished
so it really does have that kind of raw
and rustic feel to it and Bardot tops at
the hole I just absolutely adore this I
think with denim shorts well I'm on
holiday or in the UK if I wear with
high-waisted jeans that could be a
really lovely look so let's give it a
try this
is absolutely perfect it is so
comfortable and yet the elastic is
fairly tight if that makes sense so I
don't feel like it's gonna fall down at
any opportunity I think sometimes with
bando tops if the elastic isn't super
stretchy then you feel like you have to
keep poking it up whereas this feels
nice and secure personally I love in the
summer months when I do have a bit of a
tan whether real or fake I love having
this area all exposed I think it's so
like feminine and flattering it's a
little bit sexy but not in a weird sexy
way I don't know I just think it looks
really really nice I like having the
collarbones and on show as well but yeah
I've just absolutely loved this it's
very comfortable it looks exactly how I
wanted it to look the material is
perfect I like how it's got the rough
raw edge on this level and again with
necklaces just looks absolutely
beautiful these necklaces are coming up
later in the hall so stay tuned for
these but they just seem to go with
everything and yeah great success this
next hole I picked up having it thought
that it looked very similar to a
Zimmerman table zoomin is a brand is an
Australian brand and I absolutely adore
all of their pieces but they are very
expensive so I would say that this top
from Zimmermann would probably be around
200 pounds sorry about the lighting
changes it is a Sun and cloudy day today
and I am using natural light film and
but yes I digress this top I thought
looked so similar to one that is
currently for sale on the Zimmerman
website which I have been lusting over
for such a long time but I really can't
see that many differences between the
two hundred-pound one and this one to be
honest and from Zara weirdly they've
taken the label out but I think this was
around 29 pounds
so very affordable it is a kind of
broderie anglaise style top you've got
this ruffle detail on the kind of chest
area and then you've got ruffles on the
sleeves as well if you watched my eight
spring trends video you'll know that
ruffles and all of these very feminine
details are super on the trend
this season and then you also have
ruffles on the sleeves so very girly
feminine almost Victoriana style top
which is hugely on trend this spring
here comes the Sun again and once again
a really great one for summer holidays
Mexico will be fantastic for that and
also for here in the UK or wherever you
guys might live it's a really nice way
of adding a spring trend to some jeans
instantly updating a jeans and sandals
type of look
so yeah once again let's give this one a
try this blouse is absolutely perfect
it's a little bit oversized which just
makes it really really comfortable I
remember trying on a blouse kind of
similar to this from a self-portrait and
the material is so stiff there was just
no movement in it where is this I feel
very very comfortable could definitely a
little bougie really like how the
sleeves look they are very they almost
look like petals I just think that's
super pretty the way that the lace is
more detailed around the resume area
means that your underwear it's not some
show which is fantastic lengthwise I
think it's a really pretty length once
again with high-waisted skirts or shorts
this could look gorgeous
or even worn out of a pair of trousers
like I've done here
and yeah just absolutely love this
really pleased with how it fits once
gang on the shoulders it fits really
nicely and exactly the vibe that I was
going for my first accessory from the
Zara haul and it is this little bag
again a kind of designer inspired piece
looks similar ish to the cult's kaya
bags that are all over Instagram and yes
I definitely did buy it with Instagram
in mind this was $29.99 to be honest
with this type of bag I wouldn't have
really wanted to spend much more because
I think it really is a kind of holiday
only bag I won't really use this in the
UK I don't think what I do like about it
is that it has got this calico type sack
inside so all of your belongings like
credit cards aren't gonna slip through
the holes everything's not going to be
banging around on the wood so I'm very
glad they thought of that it's not the
most practical doesn't really have a
shoulder strap or anything but it's
going to look cute in the photos and
it's roomy enough that it'll fit my
camera my lipstick my credit cards my
phone etc for lunches for evening meals
while we are
on holidays so yeah so this is a really
really cute one and not a bad price next
up is something else from the lace trend
of the season
this was $39.99 and by the way with all
of these pieces I always go for the
smaller size I wear a UK 6 to 8 and in
Zara I'm an extra small so that's what
size all of these pieces are this is
basically a plain white shirt again it
looks like linen feels like linen but
linen is quite expensive so I doubt it
will be linen polyester exactly but then
that's probably a bit of a benefit as
opposed to a disadvantage because linen
actually creases really really badly
with this I've had it in a carry bag for
the past two days it's not horrendously
creased linen would literally look like
a crumpled mess if it's been in a
carrier bag for two days so even though
it's a cheaper material than linen it's
actually got all the perks of linen and
really lightweight got that same rustic
look to it but it's not going to crease
so much so definitely a benefit there so
this again I did buy with Mexico in mind
I'm obviously I'm very conscious of not
burning my skin so during the midday Sun
I like to put a really lightweight
blouse on over my shoulders I know that
a lot of people my mum also likes to do
that and if you do happen to get
sunburned there's nothing worse than
exposing that skin to the Sun so if you
do get any sun damage it's just such a
good idea to have something really
lightweight you're not going to get hot
and sweaty just to pop over your
shoulders so really love that but again
in the UK as of work flowers really
beautiful material I think we're just
under 40 pounds and really really good
value so I'm going to show you how this
looks on this blouse is pretty much
everything I expected it to be used a
really nice casual fit it fits really
nicely on the shoulders I don't like it
when smaller sizes are still quite bulky
on the shoulders it's quite a
streamlined and slim fitting silhouette
which is beautiful the material itself
really really lightweight so great for
holidays exactly what I wanted it for
very plain on the back not sure if you
could see it when I mentioned previously
but it does also have this lovely lace
detailing on the cuffs which is just
another detail that I personally really
really like I've left it undone little
bit so you could have quite a casual
vibe to it
getting on when you're wearing it but
also let me think you could probably
wear it with another piece that I've
been hauling recently I've got this
skirt from Topshop if you wanted to make
it a little bit smarter you could pair
it with a high-waisted skirt something
like this you could wear with jeans four
days in the office when you just wanted
to be a little bit more Airy ated than
any thicker materials but yeah I really
like the vibe of this one and it fits
absolutely perfectly this is one of
those pieces that I'd actually walked
past it and then I saw someone else
picking it up and it was the last one on
the rail and then when they put it down
it's like oh that must be your desirable
piece so I be lined over there and I
think it's absolutely beautiful it's
basically a long white blouse with
ruffles on the sleeves the Sun is
totally washing that out and you can see
here it's got pleated ruffles that give
a fluted effect on the sleeves and then
you've got two tiers two layers of
ruffles and pleats ooh three actually
one two three at the front and then two
layers of pleats at the back quite hard
to show you without me trying it on but
it's basically a very long white blouse
this you could wear over denim shorts
for any festivals or if you want to wear
it with oh you know my Reece light pink
rousers or if you've got any light
colored denim trousers then this would
just be a really really lovely and very
flattering way of styling really skinny
trousers I'm actually planning a video
on how to choose styles that are
flattering for every body shape let me
know if that's something that you would
like to see and that this I think is a
really good tip if you are not
comfortable with your hips or your
thighs we all have days that we would
rather be hiding certain areas of our
body then wearing something longline
like this over a pair of skinny trousers
is a really great way of creating the
illusion of a very slender silhouette
because it does hide the parts of our
body that we do not necessarily wants to
our focus to so I'm going to show you
this with my pink Rhys trailers that'll
hopefully give you a better idea of just
how gorgeous it is so I think this top
could actually be worn as a dress
because it is a little
longer than I expected I've got it on
with miry Strauss's which are just the
most amazing trousers ever and go with
everything and it is fairly sheer as you
can see on the sleeves it is a quite
translucent material you can kind of see
the outline of my bra but if you wear a
white one it's not really too much of a
big deal
I think if you live in a warmer climate
or if you get quite hot at work in the
office and this could be a really lovely
thing to wear for work in the summer
months I don't think you're in the UK at
least we're not quite ready for it
several wise but I think it's a gorgeous
piece it looks like if you're the kind
of person that loves to wear things on
an everyday basis I want to get that
expensive look but you don't want to
spend hundreds of pounds on a silk shirt
then this is a really nice thing to
definitely get that the more expensive
look just pair this with beautiful
handbags and classic trousers then it's
a gorgeous gorgeous look and once again
with the v-neck it's really nice for
showing off necklaces love how this
looks all together it does need it
probably will need ironing after washing
if you've got a steamer then even easier
I think that yeah oh you can even hang
this up in the shower it's such a nice
lightweight material that probably the
steam from your shower would drop out
any creases so you've got these three
layers of key to the front two layers of
pleats at the back super flattering
because as I mentioned it covers the
thighs and the hips so you just look
very streamlined but yeah this next one
is very much a holiday piece it was
$29.99 and it is this pink caftan I am
as you probably know a big fan of pink
it isn't very far my favourite colour
and especially when I'm on holiday I'll
definitely want to be rocking my
favorite blush pink shade this I thought
would be fantastic for Mexico it's gonna
not crease up when it goes in my
suitcase it's like a woven material and
then you've got this again quite boho
rustic style not being sure how you
describe this I'm just gonna show you
what this looks like
ribbony embroidered kind of detail on
the edges it does have Cape like sleeves
and then it's got this line of stitching
down here which means it will actually
be and a prophecy of as opposed to a
full-on cape okay I haven't put this on
over sewing costumes I'm not going to
show you too much detail
you can't see my underwear a little bit
but yeah it's exactly what I was looking
for really nice super chilled caftan for
sticking on over a bikini on the beach
love the v-neck and definitely show off
a nice tan I think this color is really
really flattering on every single skin
tone I think this is just the most
flattering color my favorite color like
the fact that it has got the stitching
so that sleeves are separate I don't
feel like my arms are getting lost
amongst my body you know what I mean
great success with this one I like that
it's got these stripes going down the
back as well just a nice design detail
so this is a definite yes and almost
certainly become with me
cool Nikki go the final thing that I
picked up from zara is this pair of
shoes now again if you saw my spring
trend video you'll have heard me talk
about how transparency is a huge huge
trend for spring
these have a transparent heel so
definitely taking off that trend and
also generally I find meals just so so
perfect for completing so many different
outfits there are lots of dresses skirts
pairs of trousers that if I didn't have
mules
I really just would not know how to
finish that outfit sometimes you're not
quite ready for boots you want something
a little bit more than sandals and my
gray reads meals but that have a closed
toe I by far my most worn shoes so when
I saw these I thought they'd be a really
nice way of updating my Reece ones which
are sadly out of stock which I know is
really frustrating and also they are
starting to look a little bit worse for
wax I have worn them so so much these I
thought with the brown faux suede would
be very practical very versatile in my
wardrobe they're a neutral color and
also they're not too far from a skin
color which generally I find means they
work with all my different color
combinations of different outfits
although yes my wardrobe is very much
whites and blush Pink's but this I would
definitely say is a neutral shade so
works with so many different outfit
combinations so now I'm going to whiz
through a few pieces that I picked up in
mango which was right next to the Zarya
that I went into on Oxford Street once
again that these are very much kind of
New Mexico inspired pieces but I will
certainly be wearing them in the spring
summer months when it warms up finally
here in the UK now this one is an
example of when a factory has a pattern
and they basically kind of sell that
pattern to loads of different retailers
because
okay hands up he recognizes this dress
design I had a dress identical to this
kind of from Urban Outfitters last year
it was plain white I'll insert two photo
of me wearing it here I basically lived
in it all summer and so many of you fell
in love with it so many of you bought it
and then when it sold out everyone was
very sad so I'm pleased to say that
mango have pretty much the exact same
dress I cannot actually see any design
details obviously this one is in a
different colored material and also this
one has my light I have fun design
detail change this one has front facing
pockets whereas the Urban Outfitters one
had kind of more diagonal pockets other
than that pretty much identical $49.99 I
think the Urban Outfitters warrant was
$59.99 last year so that's a little bit
different the straps are not adjustable
I can't actually remember the Urban
Outfitters ones we're not but it'll be
very easy if these straps were too long
to just give them a snip and sew them
back in place a little bit shorter if
that's what you needed so it's a dress
that fits you quite snug on the bodice
and then it has more of a voluminous
skirt this material reminds me of like a
I don't know a French cafe table health
type material but very rustic really
nice for the kind of vibe that I want to
be rocking in Mexico and in the summer
months here in the UK you could probably
even style this on warmer days now with
a suede jacket over your shoulders with
some nice sandals with some wedges or
depending on your start you could wear
with some really cool trainers that kind
of thing but yeah I think it's beautiful
love this soft brown shade love the kind
of Tour choice shell buttons and I think
hopefully the stripes on material on
this should be very flattering to the
body as well so let's give this one give
this on the try so this dress I really
really like I don't think it's gonna be
to everybody's taste it's not
particularly like sexy but I really like
the look at this dress it's pretty much
the exact same shape as the of an outfit
is one from last year so I feel like I
kind of knew how it was gonna fit really
like the button detail on the pockets
here love how the fabric changes
direction after the bodice very very
flattering I like a neckline as well
once again with some nice necklaces
really really pretty if you have got
nice bronze shoulders from your holiday
or from a victim then it's going to look
great
I think it
one of these pieces that you can just
stick on for so many different occasions
in summer whether you are going out
shopping going for lunch things like
that yeah just the kind of piece in your
wardrobe you know you can just reach for
and automatically you've got a really
lovely summery look so yes looking
forward to temperatures rising so that I
can wear this a little bit more once
again I'm going to tilt you down as you
can see how long it is goes to kind of
midway between the ankles and the knees
pockets so yeah that's quite long
almost like Prairie girl style but I'm a
big fan another rustic beachy kind of
look outfit this was actually styled in
the shop with a t-shirt underneath so if
you're a little bit cool like that then
you can definitely put a statement
t-shirt underneath this but it is a
jumpsuit I think you probably it's hard
to describe but you guys probably know
the vibe that I'm going for here I want
to say Instagram and wines it's kind of
like a Lucy Williams vibe very - l'm
very California style blogger that
always just had the most amazing time
and really cool outfits I thought these
were definitely giving off that kind of
vibe is it reformation that kind of that
kind of style Chloe girls yeah you guys
know what I mean quite rustic and boho
ish this has got little side pockets
you've got to tie the waist you've got
these buttons I think look really really
high-quality
and then as I said is a jumpsuit
hopefully won't be too long for me if it
is this is such an easy hem to just chop
and change yourself if you or your mom
or your auntie or anyone is good at
sewing machine it this is very very
easily adjustable so let's give it a try
and see if I need to make any
adjustments okay so the top parts of the
jumpsuit I really really love I'm not
sure if it gets a little bit baggy as it
goes down but overall I do really really
like it love it with this little
combination of necklaces as well I think
this with a tan will look absolutely
gorgeous and material-wise could crease
a little bit so might need to use the
hotel iron after it being in a suitcase
I would say fit wise I expected it to be
a little bit smaller so if you are
between sizes I would say to go down one
I'm gonna tilt the camera down so you
can see how it looks on
legs but love the positions of the
pockets I'm really glad it has got these
pockets and yeah I think with the time
this is gonna be the perfect outfit for
popping on at lunchtime after morning on
the beach so you can see the bottoms
here they are quite wide but yeah I
really like that relaxed fit it's not
see-through which is great can't see my
underwear underneath yeah overall very
very impressed this is another great
deep piece and going off that whole
Instagram vibe that I was explaining
earlier it is a good dupe for a mezzo
monoculars omen London necklaces are all
the rage on Instagram we all know and
love the horn necklace and which was
actually a Lisa Williams horn necklace I
feel like I'm fangirling a little bit
yeah but this is very similar to one of
the new mazuma designs which I believe
is over 150 pounds don't quote me on
that
this was $15.99 and I think with a tan
with a really cute bikini or with these
outfits I've shown you earlier this is
just going to be the most perfect
holiday slash boho summer necklace it's
got kind of nobody sure how you
described this it's almost like a
piratey style compass type I don't know
coin or Roman is it kind of like a Roman
style I'm not sure but I think that's
gonna look really really cute in real
life and in Instagram photos last but
not least and these were actually the
only thing where I was like oh I wasn't
expecting them to be that expensive
these shoes were $59.99 from mango but I
think that just kind of shows that
they're quite fair with their pricing
and that if something requires a higher
price tag because the materials or the
craftsmanship then that's when it will
have a higher price and they won't just
stick a high price on everything just
for the sake of it or at least I'm
hoping that others the reason this high
price they are as you can see slip-on
mule type shoes flat sandals great for
the beach great for holiday is great for
just slipping on if you are just dashing
out for a short while they won't be good
for all day they won't be great walking
shoes because they don't have much
support but I think if you're looking
for a nice rustic pair of sandals for
beach holidays then these are really
really beautiful this sounds really
shallow but I do choose things sometimes
based on how they look on Instagram and
how I want my
ground look while we're in Mexico it's
very rustic so these I thought would
fitting absolutely perfectly also issues
like this sandals like this especially
that don't have an ankle strap it's very
leg lengthening a strap that goes around
the ankle instantly makes your legs look
shorter whereas if there's no strap and
your leg flows into your foot it does
create kind of an optical illusion
making your legs look longer so if
you're wearing these with a bikini or
denim shorts and they are very very
flattering so there's everything that
I've picked up recently from Zara and
mango I very much hope you enjoyed
looking through these pieces of me I
know that they are bringing out amazing
new pieces every single day I've seen
someone doing some Instagram stories
this morning with loads of beautiful
blush pink colored things so I think I'm
gonna have to go in again so let me know
if you'd like to see another spring Zara

pieces in my high street hauls just give

something that you would like to see I

matter where you're from this is
