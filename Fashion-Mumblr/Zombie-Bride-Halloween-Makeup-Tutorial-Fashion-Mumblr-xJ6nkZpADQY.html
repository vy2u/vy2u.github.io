Halloween makeover tutorial when we re
creating this a zombie bride makeup look
for you I'm using all makeup just from
my very own makeup draw but also a
couple of pieces just from the pound
store this is some white cream makeup
along with the hourglass and metallic
finish powder foundation you can use any
foundation I just like the consistency
of this one for this look I've blended
the two together then using my Real
Techniques buffing brush to Pat it all
over the face and also onto the lips
just to give the pale finish ready to
start with them then I'm using my sleek
makeup palette this is the eye divine
eyeshadow palette in natural so that
leaves a great shade for this look and
I'm starting with a light grey all over
the eyelid you really don't need to be
too precise with this whole look I'm not
makeup artist I'm just kind of making it
up as I go along
bringing it underneath the eyelid as
well then going in with a darker shades
on the lid because I'm using all things
from my own makeup drawer it's great for
a last-minute look so you really don't
need to go and buy anything extra
special so then I'm going in with a
naked Urban Decay smoky palette again
lots of great shades for Halloween if
you've got this one I'm gonna be using
the purple on the crease of my eye just
to give more definition to this smoked
out dark look and again bringing it
underneath to create a really dark
finish then I'm using a matte eyeshadow
quad I've got another purple shade in
there then my everyday brow product
switch to the Urban Decay brow timer
pencil and gel then I'm using the barium
light-reflecting concealer just
underneath the eye area because partly
because I've got a bit of shadow under
there and it's a bit darker than I
wanted and also
to kick off the contouring blend
Anderson with my buffing brush and I'm
using the bourgeois color edition
24-hour cream I think this is an
eyeshadow that I'm actually using it for
some really dark bruised looking and
contouring again using just a Real
Techniques contour brush here to really
define the cheekbones and I'm bringing
it up along the hairline as well I'm
also patting it on my forehead this is
to make myself look a little bit more
battered and bruised you don't have to
do this babe if you don't want to but I
think it just adds to the zombie look
also down the neck and into my
collarbone just to make myself look a
little bit more skeletal and bruised
I'm also patting onto my lips I want my
lip area to look quite gory so I've just
bitten into some flesh or something so
I've added the purple and then I'm going
back in with my sleek palette adding
some white to the brow bone then using a
smaller brush I'm taking the purple from
the palette underneath the eyes and back
with the eyeshadow quad from Mac just a
purple one again over the crease of the
eyelid again you really don't need to be
too precise here just whatever you feel
looks best
then from the naked smoky I'm using the
grey to add a bit more color and contour
to the bruised bit on the forehead
and I'm also going to use this shade to
create even more definition on my
console so make sure it's all blended in
along the hairline and down the neck as
well also if you do it under the chin it
just creates a bit more definition and
shape to the face I'm putting some
purple from the Mac palette onto my lips
as well create a bit of shadow and
shading and then using the Ilia party
snow princess lashes just to give my
eyes even more definition I'm using the
Rimmel pavakah lips in the shade playing
with fire just with my fingers to
loosely tap it onto my lips this is
great cuz it's really long-lasting so it
won't be going anywhere for out for the
whole evening and it's a pretty good
color match for blood and then I'm using
the Too Faced better than sex mascara to
really bind my actual lashes to the
false lashes I always go in with some
mascara after false lashes I think it
just makes a to work better together so
you could finish this look here or add
some nice accessories like I've got this
spider tiara from Claire's all Dewar's
idea and make it a little bit more gory
with more fake blood which I'm adding to
the corner of the mouth to give this a
really gory zombie look just again
spreading it roughly with my fingers
don't be too precise you want us to look
quite natural and wasn't that trolls of
bloody mouth can look and then whatever
I had left on my fingers I'm just
bringing it down to the neck giving this
a really gory Samba look and then I put
some purple shadow on my buffing brush
and blending this out to complete the
look then the finishing touches of
course the wedding veil vo zombie bride
look and that's it I really hope you
guys enjoyed this makeup look please
give it a thumbs up if you had and if
you'd like to see any more Halloween
