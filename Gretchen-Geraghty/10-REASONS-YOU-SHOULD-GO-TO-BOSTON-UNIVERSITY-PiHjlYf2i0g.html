telling you ten reasons why you should
be coming to Boston University it's such
amazing school and I'm so happy here
right now it's the spring of my
sophomore year and I can't believe I'm
almost halfway PS if you need to my
channel you should definitely subscribe
so you can be notified when I post new
videos right here I just have it ten
reasons that I came up with so number
one I have is the best of both worlds
it's a city campus and there actually is
grass in West Campus for me I knew I
wanted to be at least in a city or near
City for college I love that bu isn't
such a central part of Boston you're so
close to Newberry you're so close to
everything that being said since it is a
city campus I was sort of like okay like
I wanted to see grass in trees you know
I only want it to be one street like
Commonwealth with a bunch of grey
buildings luckily I live in West Campus
and even if I didn't live here you can
come here all the time and there's grass
in trees and the soccer field so the
second reason you should come to view is
that the dining halls are actually
amazing there's Bay State Warren tower's
which I've actually never been to which
is so funny but I've just never lived
there and the dining hall that I go to
most often is West just because I live
in West Campus and also there's like
Hallel and there's this a whole million
other places to eat on campus to you is
a vegan station to look at every dining
hall the food is actually so good also I
want to mention I really wanted to film
this video for you guys because hey I
love be you and be I never wanted that
to be like mistaken in my other videos
because I'm I go here obviously I love
it
and I know recently I made a video I
made this funny little song about bu
housing just because housing at every
college is so difficult and I just
thought it was a really relatable
subject and so many people are
commenting like ah like same thing
happen to me like housing is really hard
but I knew that video might be taking
the wrong way and I think it started to
just get misconstrued so I took it down
because I don't want to say anything
negative about bu because I truly love
it here so excited for the next two
years so the third reason is the
education is really insanely good the
professors I find are also impressive
they're not just teachers they're like
ex-ceo is like do research on the side
and are also established and it's just I
think even that more helpful to have a
professor teaching you that because
they're ready come from a place of such
high success and I know as a prospective
student which probably a lot of you are
looking at you might be a little
daunting just because it is such an
expensive school and that was a really
big thing that me and my twin sister
Lucy my parents we're looking at but at
the end of
we kind of decided that a degree from bu
would look better than a degree from
maybe some other college that wasn't as
expensive or wasn't like as good in
academics you know so I just think going
to be really is worth it in the long run
so before the reason you should come
here is there's so many clubs are so
many extracurriculars bu is a really big
school if you quickly find like a club
or somewhere you fit in it can make be
looking a lot smaller in more like a
little community Zordon clubs your
extracurriculars clubs sports even if
you want to walk on like a d1 team like
you guys know I wrote in the lightweight
team last year and literally it's so
funny because that's the only reason I
came to bu cuz I got recruited for
lightweight running but things change I
quit this fall I also changed my major
and also don't be scared everyone
changes their majors no one really knows
what they want to do so don't stress
that about that and I actually just
joined Alfea this spring I Russia's a
sophomore weight I actually my pin on
from initiation this morning so in case
you're wanting that this is that's
really funny I'm so wearing I'm
officially a member to stir about see
here at BU that just speaks to my point
there's so many ways to get involved
whether it's athletics Greek life clubs
like you name it the fifth reason you
should come to BU is actually a little
light pack probably a lot of you that go
to V you know this but you can order
pizza with your dining points at the U
so you have like convenience points and
dining points inconvenience point you
have to like buy with money so it's
basically just like money on your ID
card but dining points you get is a part
of like your meal plan so ordering pizza
with your dining points is so nice cuz
it's like not even real money the sixth
reason you should come to Boston
University is that it is right in the
heart of Boston like I mentioned before
it's so close to Mary and Boston is just
an amazing college town there is so many
colleges in Boston I can't even begin to
start I think it's just really special
being in the town where so many people
are like the colleges you'll need way
more friends and just a really a great
place to be when you are in college so
the seventh reason you should come to
Boston University is Marathon Monday
flash patriots day it's literally so fun
the eighth reason you should come to I
really thought about and I just really
am so appreciative of how diverse the
student body is just having classes with
people from all over the world like I've
learned so much that I never would have
learned I've come in contact with people
that I never would
otherwise caring about their cultures
listening to our language is so
impressive they're literally as kids
from like hundreds of countries around
the world that come to be you it really
helps like branching out in college to
because you just meet so many different
types of people so the ninth reason you
should come to BU is even though it's
such a huge school you really will find
your friends and find your little sense
of community with people that you
surround yourself with just knowing that
that's up to you is kind of really
freeing and independent that's super
nice if you are friends with people in
the beginning that you're like oh
they're not really making me a better
person or pushing me academically or
allowing me to be the best version of
myself you can find other people to
surround yourself with since it's such a
big school I know the fact that how many
undergrad students are there I think
it's like 16,000 might be wrong that can
be really daunting but you really will
find your close-knit group of friends
and you may not think this but you
actually will run into familiar faces on
common I promise the tenth reason you
should come to BU is the hockey team
that is all okay but the hockey teams
are honestly so fun I remember when I
was looking at bu out sort of bummed out
that they didn't have a football team
because I feel like big state school the
big football teams are just so fun
obviously like so much school spirit and
although there isn't a football team at
BU the hockey team I feel like is just
the same as football would be people go
crazy for hockey games or so much school
spirit and it's really fun to be a part
of that as well being a college student
so yeah I hope those ten little reasons
to come to bu helped persuade you I'm
just a really big fan because I've been
here for two years and I've had such an
amazing experience feel so blessed and
so lucky to be here and I know not
everyone can go to college so I truly
feel so thankful for this video and I'll
see my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
