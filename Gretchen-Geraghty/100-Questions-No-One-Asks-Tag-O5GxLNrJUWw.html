outside cuz I like the lighting it's
like nicer um and I just filmed and get
ready with me video on like what I'm
wearing right now I haven't made a video

honestly just because I've been so busy
I'm honestly more busy now in the summer
than I am during the school year like
it's that crazy but crew has been my
entire life like that's basically all I
can say just like I've been so so busy
with crew and I did really well at Club
nationals just forgot it and Camden New
Jersey this last week question 1 do you
sleep with your closet doors open or

of person

like in real life so definitely bear do

cheeks in my nose especially during the
summer they like come out even more

I just don't think they're that small
maybe do you always smile for pictures

don't know it makes my eyes too going
tough in my face but all scrunched so I
don't really like my smile I know
somebody like you know those people that
have just like a smiling faces and they
look so pretty when they smile and like
their smile just like makes him a
prettier I don't know I feel when I
smile it just looks kind of weird like

fun time go to a passion concert you can
like it's really good hot - you're cold
tea it depends I like both pot eve it's
cold out cold TV it's hot out

I don't want to like the taste of coffee
so yeah T it is sugar or snickerdoodles
snickerdoodles because those have like
cinnamon in them and those are really
good
can you swim well yes I'm a very good
swimmer I used to swim competitively on
a team and I really love swimming
honestly if you have the chance to swim
do it it's like the best workout ever
and I'm a lifeguard so I mean I have to
be all this so well so yeah I consider
myself a very it's where I love
something can you hold your breath
without holding your no yes that was me
holding my breath I didn't know my nose
why oh maybe it means like swimming lies
like in the water yeah you just hold
your breath it's not that hard you just
don't plug your nose what kind of
question is that okay
whatever that was beer are you patient
no I wish I could say I was a patient
person like I try to be patient but I'm
really like fast paced and I'm always
like on to the next thing and everyone's
like Gretchen like calm down like slow
down it's all right and I'm always like
like what's going on like I'm really
like I don't know like high energy I
would say so I'm really not patient like
if I wanted to do something I want to
get it done like it it has to get done
and if it's not I'm just like come on
let's go like I'm always like oh and I
wish I could be more like relaxed and
like chilled out but I'm really like oh
yeah
like I'm not patient at all deejay or
band at a wedding I would say band cuz
the DJ makes me think a little school
dance and it's not really like elegant
like at a wedding so I would say van
just because bands usually play at
weddings anyway I'd say well I that's
kind of what your question everyone a
contest yes I can think of one I
probably learned more than this but I
can think of one in specific one in
specific is that a term one specifically
that I won it was that like this race
when I played volleyball
we did this like 5k like running or
something and there was like you know
like raffles and I entered my ticket and
I won it was like this bag full of like
makeup and it was like nice makeup it
was from like Sephora and it was like
before I even got into makeup it was
like eighth grade and I was like oh
what's herbin decay like I like didn't
even know you know I'm gonna have like
tart stuff and I was like what's this
and that that probably like got me in to
make it more - because that was like who
like pink lip gloss but um yeah have
likes for makeup and I had like a bunch
gift cards to like bruger's like a big
bagel place that they have around here
and like other places - I know I'm
burgers though so I just like giveaway
where I live it's whatever but yeah they
had like they had like gift cards to
like
Lisa's at this contest that I won so
that was question ever have
plastic-surgery know I've had like
normal like mouth surgery on my teeth
because my teeth are really screwed up
big not like plastic surgery which are
better black or green olives black
definitely I don't even know if I've had
a green olive but I'm like scared to eat
them because they look kind of
disgusting and they're in like martinis
and stuff and like no I don't want green
olives it when there's like red in them
like what is that even I don't know but
I do like black olives in there and I've
always loved them since I was little I
used to eat them plain which is like
gross to me now like they're not that
good but I'll eat them if they like in
my salad like that kind of thing
can you knit or crochet yes I remember
one time I like knit a scarf my grandma
showed me how but like now I wouldn't
remember someone has to show me again
but I have negotiated in the past you
know that's a strong possibility best
room for a fireplace well we have a
fireplace in there in our living room
when we happen in our family room - we
are living yeah we have a fireplace in
our living room in our family room but I
think the best place for one would
honestly be like your bedroom or your
bathroom like how cool would that be if
you were going to sleep and it was like
winter and it was like chilly and you
could just snuggle up in bed and like
read a book read you know probably watch
TV or go on your computer but like if
you had like a fireplace like wouldn't
it be really cool and it'd make you a
room all toasty warm yeah so deck public
your room Oh your bathroom that'd be so
cool but if you were taking a bath and
there was a good player placement that'd
be really cool I don't even know if
that's possible but yeah so probably the
best room for a fireplace to be like
your bathroom your bedroom that'd be
really like relaxing and nice do you
want to get married definitely
definitely I do really want to get
married because that just seems like fun
like having a family and everything and
growing up like I'm so excited but like
I remember not a little I always wanted
to like this age I always wanted to be
like 16 I always want to grow up and now
that I'm 16 I'm like no like I wish I
was like seven years old like I wish I
was a little kid with like no worries
because nails are now we have like
responsibilities and like no I just want
to be a little kid do you want to get
married that was the question yes I
would like to get married
if married how long have you have you
been married
if mine how long have you been married
oh well I'm not married now only 16
who was your high school crush I like
don't have one high school is boring and
stupid and I just want to go to college
yeah I just I really want to go to
college like I'm so done with high
school I have two more years I'm gonna
be a junior and I just want like get out
of this place like I just want to go to
college so high school crush I don't
have one and I don't see myself having
one because I'm just done with high
school high school while there's me do
you cry and throw fit until you get your
own way I'd like to say I don't but I
kind of do oh my god this is so funny
well at least I used to and I'm trying
to work on it my parents try to tell me
like Gretchen every time you don't get
you're right you can't like cry about it
and like push until you get your ride
but I still do when I wish I didn't cuz
that's really mature and I need like
grow up but and I always realized that
I'm like being a bad kid after the fact
like after I get what I want I'm like
ooh now I feel bad like I shouldn't have
been a brat in the first place do you
know what I mean kind of I don't know so
I kind of do crying Fitz until I cry and
throw up until I get my way but then I
realized afterwards so I should probably
try to work on them I'm gonna keep that
right in here to it reflect on my
actions I need to think about how I
treat others this is getting deep this
is making me question my life right here
do you have kids no do you want kids yes
I think the perfect number is like three
or maybe four I didn't know than two and
I feel like when you're young you always
want more kids and then when you're
older you're like oh like one is
perfectly fine because it's like a lot
of work obviously but like it's only me
and my twin sister Lucy and I do like
that but I almost wish we did have more
siblings like a younger brother it'd be
really cute or even like older siblings
I don't know
cuz like some of my friends have really
big families like four or five kids and
it just seems like a blast like it would
be fun the whole time have you guys
noticed I'm like rocking back and forth
in this chair this whole time is that
like really annoying sorry I'm like but
um yeah so my friends that like really
big families and I just feel like that
would be the funnest thing ever
yeah kids yeah like three okay uh-huh
what's your favorite color hmm that is a
very good question my room is purple but
I actually like totally regret painting
a purple now because I wish it was like
blue or pink or something I don't know
I just let him look pretty indecisive
and I change my mind a lot so my
favorite color is definitely not purple
and I wish my arm was in purple as awful
as that sounds like light pink my older
must pink and I don't think I'll ever
get to say good things like light pink
is really pretty light blue like oh like
turquoise Tiffany blue I really
oh yeah I really like white a lot like I
like wearing white this makes me look
tan and white just goes with everything
so yeah I do like white
I like black too like wearing black I
like gray I don't know I don't think I
really have favorite color I like lots
of colors
do you miss anyone right now yes I do
miss someone but he does not live here
all right
so that is the end of all the questions
