I haven't blogged in like a little while
I feel like a few it's been quite a bit
sorry I definitely like morning boys
right now I just woke up and I'm gonna
vlog more after I do my hair and get
ready but I just thought like why not
start the world care you know let's just
be real this is how I look in the
morning and cuz I wanted to show you my
breakfast yay
I feel like at home senior year and I
always make toast with peanut butter
banana but now that I'm in college I
don't have a toaster and then I was just
thinking the other day hey how do you
get a toaster in here but it just like
hit me so anyway I usually just have
oatmeal with banana and almond butter
and this is the almond butter I use in
case you're wondering it's just the
vanilla almond butter except it's like
really expensive most places I got it
from Whole Foods and when it's it's
almost like 15 bucks or something
look there's swittel hi squiggles I put
him there I decided I would vlog today
because it's going to be exciting I
guess I'll just get into that more later
I'm gonna get ready now and I have to go
run because I have an 8 a.m. class and
it's like 7:15 so I have like finish
getting ready and like run to my classes
and you guys know I've talked about this
before but I guess I'm just gonna give
you like a big like update on life
because my other videos I guess I don't
talk about like my life is much just I
talk about it more on my blogs but I
came in to bu as a bio major and I was
miserable my fall semester it's just
nothing against like biochem I like took
it all of high school and I really
really enjoyed it so I thought that's
what I wanted to do I thought I wanted
to go to dental school and it turns out
I don't because I did not enjoy my
classes at all in the fall it was really
hard for me to like be interested in
when I was learning and like studying
stuff and I was like this isn't for me
finally it like hit me that I should be
going into business or marketing or like
advertising I was between the
communications school here in the
business school and I decided on the
Business School and so far I just love
my classes like they're so interesting
for those of you that are like
considering business I would definitely
say try it out I mean I don't know that
much about it because I'm only been
taking classes for like what like seven
weeks or whatever but um so far so good
I like loving it and I hope I get like
good enough grades so that I can
transfer in because if you really trying
to transfer in to the classroom School
of Business here you have to get like
really good grades in your classes so
I'm like trying my hardest it's like not
easy by any means I would say the work
is less than bio income because bio and
chem I was just like drowning like I
only choose three our labs a week and
okay whatever this isn't the point of
this video I just wanted to give you a
little update life so basically I've
eight hams every single day the spring
semester because I have to get all my
intro business classes in and I'm like
starting a semester late you know but I
knew I know I'm gonna film on college
advice video too that will probably even
be up before this video is it he was
actually gonna go up on Lucy's my
birthday and I guess I'll just get into
that more later but I have to eat in
finish getting ready yet now I've been
walking forever but I just got carried
away talking about school so yeah come
on you guys I hope you have a great day
what's morning for me at least what I
was damn embarrassed I just had lecture
down there
so that if this feels really weird right
now I'm actually in the bathroom because
I'm like too embarrassed to blog like
when I'm walking around like all these
people around me and I'm not gonna walk
around like holding this big like
vlogging camera so the last thing you
saw was I took some footage of the
business school I tried to move my
camera but then I was really embarrassed
but there's so many people mad so then I
just took some footage of my phone so if
I'm like other public places during the
day it may be some of my phone if like
the quality looks different because I'll
be too embarrassing without my phone but
yeah I remember I said I wasn't I put on
makeup and I did I straightened my hair
so whoo good for me but it's been like a
really really good day so far because I
met with my cat professor about my first
cupcake Sam we just like went over and
like whatever questions I had and she
ended up giving me eight points back
because she said the craters were like
really rough so I'm just really happy
that was really great and now I have to
go run to Newberry because I have to get
Lucy a present so like I said earlier
did I say earlier circumstances have it
that Lucy and I will not be together for
a birth it is here and I'm really really
sad about it because we even together
for our birthday for the last 18 years
and we're turning 19 and I'm not gonna
be together because of just how things
have played out and I'm really really
sad about it
so basically today is our like pretend
birthday with each other which is my
hang on to vlog and we already got each
other our birthday presents actually
over here two ago because we were
shopping at Newbury
like I want this in tubes look I want
this to be like honor for each other but
she's also been telling you about this
Tiffany necklace that she's wanted for
like such a long time
we already got each other presents but I
was like you know I just really want to
get it for her because I know I don't
make her so happy and I said to her
yesterday let's see I'm going to get you
like some it's just like a little
surprise tomorrow like it's not a big
deal at all and well like have dinner
together tomorrow night they can like
give each other our presents and pretend
like it's our birthday since we won't be
together on our birthday but I'm going
to get her a Tiffany necklace and if
she's gonna be so surprised like I said
I told her I was just a little surprised
but it's looking pretty like expensive
like nice present and I'm gonna get a
salad for my favorite restaurant your
sweet green we always go every salads
and I think I'm gonna get someone
Georgetown cupcakes so I got to go run
to do that because I have other stuff I
have to do later with like academic
meeting stuff like that I'm really
excited for tonight did my Lulu I can't
wait to surprise her so yeah that was
like the reason I wanted to vlog today
which I mentioned earlier so I'm gonna
