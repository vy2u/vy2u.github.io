I'm sitting like open oh yeah so we like
to forget like for each others before
that time to try on Oh what you saw like
the two seconds
my little makeup video this lighting is
a one when you say Tasha yeah I didn't
see you I have the same vlogging camera
in my no way oh my gosh yes the same one
- guys I'm freaking out oh my gosh
there's a genius over here okay so
basically right on the way home I don't
know how he's started talking about it
how do bees are dying yet oh I was like
yeah I was like what's California the
San Francisco and she's like no in
Sacramento oh my god I'm so dumb and I
was like did you have to learn all the
capitals I did it and she's like I did
and then I was like I'm gonna quiz you
so I pulled up on Wikipedia all of the
states and their capitals and I've been
quizzing Tasha and some like I pretty
much know none of em are some of them
I've heard of but Tasha like doesn't
know them and then I like give her the
first letter and she'll just be like
Trenton Baton Rouge I'm like I had them
down don't like if you just give me like
the first letter I'll be like but I
won't even know it's a thing like yes
like what did I say you just like spits
it out and I'm like right like how did
you know wait what's Baton Rouge the
capital of again I don't know I can't do
it backwards yeah but if you say the
state then you'll know it Louisiana she
was Baton Rouge together yeah guys how
weird is that like memory like how like
we were saying how like colors or like
sense or like smells bring you back to
like memories okay ready watch her in
action
yeah I know now you're not getting good
hey so what's the capital of New York
Albany Oh guys we both did it no I
really shouldn't say this makes us look
so dumb we both oh no I go to Wyoming
girl we both didn't know that Boston was
the capital of Massachusetts
Liz I just like it not like a weird do
people not discuss this oh wait is there
like a capital building there must be
wow I sound so dumb please don't hate me
for this like I live in Boston for most
of the year so whatevs
okay moving on where were we Oh North
Carolina you know that we'll cut out all
the ones you missed so this is like a
brain teaser no it starts with an R
y-yeah really I think it's a sit yeah
right as I give you the first letter you
just know it she is thinking everything
was coming out of the folds in her brain
she literally was like spitting out
these capitals and I've never heard of
before
how do you know this Ohio you know this
one I probably would've guessed probably
not see well you know yeah I can love
this whoa look at her go
incredible Oklahoma this is a trick like
it's really easy
yeah or again we this is weird because
it's where Neal I kept saying earlier
about a different state that you thought
it was the capital of but it's somehow
in Oregon which I always thought was
pronounced Oregon but it's really open
I know I used to say okay once the
letter S yeah
like see we thought that seeing them
might have been kept the kappachu says
the capital Massachusetts there's
probably the most boring part of the
vlog to watch but I just don't care cuz
it's really interesting to me
Pennsylvania I've never heard of this I
don't think
eight forget what you started to stand
I'm like Rhode Island this I probably
wouldn't have guessed Providence yeah oh
my god see incredible ladies enjoy the
aisle genius
South Carolina but does start with a
scene with no Charleston no it's a
really good to ethnicity love you never
heard of bet Columbia South come on
South Dakota I've never heard of this
place if you get it I've done a lot
again P P what ti brain folds come on he
can do any wrong so it goes through his
whole brain
wait notes - I got this shows all like
the neurons like the nerve cells and
you're like police thinking he's
thinking so hard P I yep it sounds like
a French man I don't know French names I
don't even know where does every would
live actually know this isn't true
I think a lot of people on the
bachelor/bachelorette have any oh it
sounds like that yeah never been there
and I also do Tennessee about naturalism
like Texas or something yeah check this
I've been doing incredible Utah I know
this one
because my friend is remains wait West
Virginia I'm shook if I can't say it
because then it'll give it away easy but
I didn't know this was here I know this
is somewhere else oh you would think of
that one but like I've never heard of
this being in West Virginia it starts
with the sea yeah what the any one of
those files that I've been missing
Charleston is holding that's so crazy I
thought Charleston was only in South
Carolina I didn't know there's a
Charleston West Virginia yeah why is our
- Charleston's I don't like that
Wisconsin I know this one cuz I visited
the school there and then Madison yeah
look at you go and then we have one more
Wyoming
we didn't even knock Wyoming with this
day to see age it's a girl's name she
went to my high school
Cheyenne nope would've guessed it this
is Cheyenne let me note this is what
happens let me give you like a lesson
miss me like after you learn on men
Terry school middle school high school
right you look you learn broad general
like everything like everyone learns
like this right but then you go to
college and you learn like this little
piece like you specialize that's it
doesn't say like you specialize in your
learning so then you forget all the
other stuff like you don't completely
forget it you just have a more like
general knowledge of it it isn't the
brain folds as we've just uncovered
because Tasha knows what Baton Rouge yep
any of your from where we didn't know
where that is I'm sorry it's just
because we're from like the Northeast
and don't know where that is but yeah if
we were from Baton Rouge I would know
about Andrews's okay okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
