wear plaid because I feel like a farmer
I died today I didn't have my first kiss
until I was 16 that's really really
really scared of Santa Claus and I'm not
even kidding I do it everyone I'm really
excited for today's video and today I'm
just sharing 50 random facts or 50
things I don't think you actually know
about me and I'm only time to share with
you so you get to know some things you
probably have no idea about and just
some odd quirky things and you'll get to
know me better so let's just get right
into it
I wrote them all down in my phone so I'm
just gonna read them up to you number
one I'm a very like touchy-feely or
affectionate person I don't know I've
just always been like that number two I
can only sleep on my stomach number
three if you're a boy you might not
understand it's kinda hard to explain
but I always split my shampoo in the
shower into two hands and one is for
like the front of my head and one it's
been the back so I don't know that's
kind of weird but yeah number four I
floss almost every night I'm like really
crazy about my teeth number five I wear
my retainers also almost every single
night I like want a good smile forever
you know number six I always think about
death and it scares me a lot I just
remember like waking up in like ninth
grade and I bet I really would have died
at it number seven I hate change and I
can't deal with it when things change it
freaks me out I get all frazzled like
every new school year it's a big change
and it's hard for me to cope number
eight I bite the insides of my lips
horribly it's a very bad habit number
nine this is kind of
embarrassing and his probably something
you do not know when I was a baby my
head was in the 95th percentile for like
head size I were really really big head
when I was a baby I guess it was like
I'm normally huge by parents always said
that my doctors were like nervous about
how big my head was number ten very
behind in the development of my teeth I
seriously lost my last baby tooth when I
was 16 like how embarrassing number 11 I
may have said in a video before but my
biggest fear is being trapped in a cave
with the water like filling up so you
can't breathe and there's a scene like
in the Titanic when they're like sucking
at the earth good and it just literally
freaks me out thinking you out it like
that is definitely my biggest fear
number 12 is that I actually do not hate
spiders that much a lot of girls do or
no Lucy hate them and will screw up that
have come along so I'm like Oh chill out
usually I don't like killing them I
usually will get like a bowl or just
like a cup and I'll like put this biter
in it and like let it free outside cuz I
don't want to kill it number 13 is that
Hannah my best friend and I share a
locker I think it's funny because she
had moved in at the end beer so we share
a locker and were 14 is that I
absolutely love elephants love them
number 15 makes me laugh so hard when I
was in elementary school I used to cut
my side bangs until they were even and
they would be like halfway up my
forehead I would literally cut them
myself my mom would get so bad sorry the
Sun is setting so I'm really trying to
get this done quickly because the
lighting is getting darker number 16 is
that I hate being alone and I always
rather be with someone or a group of
people aren't really and one of those
people that like thrives off of other
people and I just hate being alone 417
is that I love cities in the country is
like okay too but only for so long like
I might go crazy if I lived in the
country and I'm definitely going to go
to college in the city so that makes me
happy number 18 is that I can make my
tongue you took clover and I'm sure a
lot of you can do this to here I'll show
you did I do it
my 19 is that Justin has been my only
serious boyfriend Oh 20 is personal I
didn't have my first kiss until I was 16
which I feel like is pretty late maybe
it's normal I don't know I was always
self-conscious about it for all you
ladies that haven't had your first kiss
it'll happen do not worry about it some
of my friends have it other first kisses
there is a time for everyone you know 21
is funny I just thought I'd throw it in
here I've actually asked for a laptop
every single year for Christmas since I
was five years old
lol I was such a little brat I oh he
wanted the laptop like why does the
fight a girl need a laptop twenty-two is
really embarrassing and I don't like
talking about it but I'm really really
really scared of Santa Claus and I'm not
even kidding like it's a very irrational
fear I'm so scared of him he's like big
and fat and goes down your chimney and
will break into your house essentially
and I'm just scared of him Oh so every
year in Christmas I still have to sleep
with Lucy and cuddle with her so she can
comfort me because Santa is like
seriously so scary I love him he brings
presents but I'm honestly scared of him
23 is that when I was growing up I had a
weird obsession with drawings new forces
I was always really fancy horses don't
know why 24 is that I actually had a
root canal when I was 11 years old which
i think is really young I was a bad kid
Nick candy all the time and it was the
most painful experience of my life and I
never want one ever again it was awful
25 whoa halfway I was a lot chubbier in
the beginning of freshman year in eighth
grade and I've actually lost 10 to 15
pounds since then when I was in eighth
and ninth grade i never really thought
about healthy eating or anything like
that so I would just like eat whatever I
wanted whenever like pizza and cake
every day but yeah so I actually lost
like 10 or 15 pounds since I'm just like
crazy to think about in where 26 is that
I actually started dyeing my hair in
fourth grade and I was only nine
like how crazy I like convinced my
parents that I need the toilets because
I always had wanted blonde hair so they
let me dye my hair in fourth grade I
know in 47 days that I've had two Great
Danes and one I have right now is Aussie
and my old Great Dane his name was less
I love Great Danes number 28 is I've
also had two cats my first one when I
was really little his name was Fred and

George who actually had a stroke last
summer and died and he was my best
friend he was she different and really
cute I'll insert a picture right here me

always been obsessed with taking
pictures and I take like my family's

pictures of everything because I just
love taking pictures number 28 is that I
cracked my neck in my fingers and my
back a lot I'm always like cracking

crazy I know their sisters not twins
just just you remember ladies sisters
and not boys number 32 is that I do not
have eyelashes don't have them there are
short little stubs that I like shoved
mascara on and try to make them work but
I don't ever look at
ashes in or 33 is that I could beat
somewhere tropical every single day for
the rest of my life

number 38 is I make lists and I make a
lot of them they have me organized my
life and my 39 is Lucy is my twin sister
my best friend and my best advice giver
and she means the world to me and I just
loved Lucy bits number four days that
I'm absolutely obsessed with rowing
which most of you do know but I feel so
like invested into it and I'm really
competitive so number 41 you probably do
not know I cannot deal if someone like
grabs or touches the back of my neck

is definitely the most embarrassing but
I used to be obsessed with the weather
channel I seriously would watch it for
like hours on Everwood for fun oh my
gosh it was hard this is so embarrassing
I haven't done that for a very long time
but I'm a little used to be obsessed
with the weather channel and I would
just watch it for fun because I thought
it was like so interesting and I'd watch
all those storm shows and everything
I don't even know why it's it's a really
embarrassing and when people would like
to talk about whether now would be I
know the temperature is today like I am
Lola blah blah blah like I was such a
nerd number 44 is that in summer of 2008
I actually crashed an ATV like a quad
you know one of those four-wheelers and

leg and it ruined my summer and the
doctors told me that my one like would
be shorter than the other but thank
goodness it isn't it actually healed
okay number 45 is that I've always
enjoyed math and I used to be such a
nerd you don't even know I remember in

subject I like love that number 46
remember how I told you I used to eat
very unhealthy when I was in fifth grade

supposed to eat five pancakes every
single day at least for the next year
the sad thing is I probably did it too
number 47 is I think my daddy's been in
some of my videos but I just thought it
was interesting it's not really about me
it's about him but if I don't tell you

of scary movies I can't watch them I
won't watch them I hate them I hate
scary movies why would you ever want to
