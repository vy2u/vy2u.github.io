day in the life of lifeguards right now
whoo chips and guac YUM it's the life
cuz okay so basically the three of us
and well there's other like parts to
that we're here we work at like
apartment complex pools near where we
live kind of and I talked about this
before but then it's like a privately
owned pool there's like not that many
people that come too often why you
beautiful it's okay Lucy's your nails no
but so like people don't comment often
and like when they do obviously like we
don't like to have our phones out and
like eat and do our nails whatever but
like if there's no one here we're kind
of allowed to do whatever so it's like
really fun and like chill to work here
and like laid-back and I get to wear
bikini so that's good but like Quiles
there's people here we do our job for
good lifeguards you know like yesterday
there's like a big incident so we do do
our jobs lens are needed but like right
now no one's here so just just chillin I
even break you guys MacBooks sometimes
I'm so bad and I'll like edit videos
here no one's here even though it's kind
of hard in the Sun you know um I think
this is coming up really wrong like I'm
like bragging about how good our job is
kinda because we have the best job in
the world I know but like you guys know
if you're lifeguards and no one's at the
pool like your life is so easy like even
at the Y when we work and there's no one
there we can like go on our phones and
whatever so it's kind of the life but if
there's like a bunch of people in the
pool and there's like annoying kids or
whatever and you like yell at people
like that's annoying so I mean it's not
rainbows and sunshine all the time I'm
reading Looking for Alaska I've been
it's getting a 3d kind of Lucy can you
believe it Julia Gretchen's reading a
book I know I know
okay Julia brought cake for us like
history um some reading this book I just
started yesterday I'm only on page 27
you read yeah Lucy's making her to kiss
she told me I could it was she read me
this one paragraph I actually put that
in another vlog I feel like it's in what
they're guys you know eight yeah she
started all over Twitter 88 we're okay
we're gonna read it again no the page
yeah I know although you're so cute if
you open your books to page it everyone
follow follow along with their own copy
okay
88 this is terrible guacamole hey every
oh don't buy this don't it's bad no it's
not good I didn't give you enough walk I
had that store mock kind once and it was
just really spicy that's a good enough
for like to dislike Amy yeah god it's
like just avocado which is great
obviously I'm an onion which I hate I
don't like I love onions a little if you
love them I'm like yeah onions to work
eyes too so if like I'll read it you
guys this is what it says just like that
from a hundred miles an hour to asleep
in a nanosecond I wanted so badly to lie
down next her on the couch trap my arms
around her and sleep not like in those
movies not even have sex but sleep
together in the most innocent sense of
the phrase but I like the courage and
she had a boyfriend and I was gone and
she was gorgeous
and I was hopelessly boring and she was
endlessly fascinating so I walked back
to my room and collapsed on the bottom
bunk thinking that if people were rain I
was a drizzle and she was a hurricane

probably you to have to watch his videos
or like his brothers videos look Hank I
am watch his brothers but he has like
the Kemp stuff we just John Green have
