like any sweaters from my home to
college my home my house that sounded
funny I just have it this pullover

great great new sweater
but like there's like little threads
black in me it's like a slouchy I got
this black anorak jacket which is so
adorable and also I hope you guys
appreciate that I'm like trying all this
on because it takes a while but I know
it's helpful just see how they look some
of the people you know it's kind of like
this thinner like lightweight material
which I really like and I have some
other like military jackets like this
but I didn't have a black one so I
thought hey let's get a black one then I
got this leather jacket which yeah you
proof because I don't have a leather
jacket and I was like this is so nice
and it was still under hundred dollars
it was close but it's like I think it's
like a good investment to like invest in
a good one you know this is definitely a
good one and I think it's so cute and
yeah it's gonna like make me step out of
my comfort zone for my style which I
like it's gonna be cool like style and
stuff oh my gosh this I was so excited
to get because I've been wanting a
romper like this for so long just like
one that's like a t-shirt and shorts
because I think it's really casual but
like so cute I think I might see my
picture on Instagram or something
because that's usually where I get my
inspiration for clothes and I was just
like that is really cute and I need that
so I found this one I'm blue and I like
it because you can I trust it up and
dress it down and it's comfy I got a
white shirt but I keep laughing yeah it
just has these cool little details right
like the strings and I feel like it just
sets it apart makes it look Oh different
you know a little spicy a little fun
stretchy comfortable nice oh this I was
really excited to get it just as pink
off the shoulder dress and I've been
seeing pictures of these and people
wearing them are in Boston on Newberry
and I'm like I need a dress like this
because it goes you know across your
shoulders like that and it's just so
cute and yeah ten out of ten would
recommend you guys know I'm obsessed
with literally just putting on like the
most simple dresses to wear to class cuz
then protip you don't have to like match
it with anything so like this black
dress I'm wearing right now it's just
like all black like t-shirt dress you
know and I didn't have to like match
anything switches so nice and I'm like
obsessed with just like t-shirt dresses
like literally obsessed and I didn't
have a maroon like purple ey night so I
just got this marine company where I'm
like how nice and this is obviously
convenient for the fall and winter cuz
it's like a good fall color oh my god
this little set it's like I don't even
know what you call these like I think
it's called a good cohort
cord good coordinated set I don't really
know what I'm talking about
it's just this little two-piece set and
this is so cute I remember I tried it on
right as I got and I was like yes yes
and I've been waiting to wear it so I
could show him its haul video and now
I'm literally gonna like wear it
tomorrow it's just really cute it just
looks really good on to my foot gets
very flattering it's just white but as
you little blue details then I got this
white dress which is so adorable this I
saw on Instagram right now I was looking
through boos Instagram because literally
I buy stuff from different like websites
and companies and stuff I will usually
just look on their Instagram because I
think you just like outfits on there
like outfit ideas and I'm like hey I got
that so that usually kissed me you have
good ideas and yeah it's just his white
long-sleeved dress that is like lace in
the top and flows out really cute then I
got these black jeans which are really
cute the sizing on there you have to
like be careful look I just followed the
sizing chart because I know there's like
a bunch of different ones and I don't
even know if it's like European or
whatever but yeah I just got black I
think they're like high-waisted yeah
like a little high-waisted jeans skinny
jeans super nice then I just got this
black body sue and I've been wanting a
black bodysuit like this for awhile
because it's literally just like a
really simple tank top one and the back
is completely open so I think that's
really nice and I just have a simple
you can wear it with like so many things
white dress is not everyone's like
preference but like me and I friend
together like it and I still think it's
like so cute it's a little short I mean
like I said cuz I'm like I'm nine but I
just don't love it anyway and I'm gonna
make it work because it's just like this
plain white like 3/4 sleeve like shift
dress and the sleeves look like this
they like flare out at the very end
which I just think is like the cutest
little detail I just really like it like
I think I'm gonna dress it up I'll curl
my hair and I'll wear like my little
Tory Burch shoes and like I can't just
picture out with 10 oki'll statement
necklace you know you feel ok I got this
like blue a crop top and is just really
flowy like short sleeve and I thought it
would just be nice this is one of my
favorites too got this long sleeve
romper which is so cute I've been really
excited for it and so wearable and I can
see myself wearing this a bunch and
again I love rompers guess why I'm lazy
you don't have to really match him with
anything
just like t-shirt dresses this is just
Navy and white vertical stripes and I
have so many stripe things because I
just love stripe things I just thought
that this is a little different because
it's like vertical stripe I really don't
have anything critical strap I don't
think and this is the very last thing I
have to show you guys and I'm gonna
study for this too cuz again it's just
like a t-shirt style a dress but really
it's like not a tease your dress at all
because it's like a way more like fancy
material you know I just like how it has
the tiniest bit of like detail that
makes a little different you know like a
little diagonal like detail but it's
just like this like pink color and yeah
this isn't really t-shirt choice at all
it's more like a trust and I just
really like it I think it's cute alright
