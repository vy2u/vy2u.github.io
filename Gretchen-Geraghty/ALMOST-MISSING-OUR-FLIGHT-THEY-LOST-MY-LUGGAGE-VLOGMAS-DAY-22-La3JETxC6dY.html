life is
so they might somebody oh no we're like
happy because we're like out of it but
like two minutes ago really crying
I was gonna be left at 7:00 7:15 so
about here at 8:30

here and then I had to do what's it
called tax refunds yeah I do tax refunds
so me and mommy go to do that and that's
like math and they told us we didn't
have to mail in the talk to be fun
except everyone else up to this point
it's my doing did so then we go Erin so
that was the most messy check-in I've
ever seen and what is that he's our
courier he tried it on so we get to the
errands check-in and we like this week
for like probably 15 minutes and then
they're like oh you're in the wrong one
you have to go took three and they're
like no I'm horrified
whoever the other one I'm like oh no I
do you're importing prices Air France
but it's actually operated by Delta so
if you go to dump site eight it's like
all the way down into even waiting for
check-ins this whole time that we're on
our actual check-in them a good sale to
wait forever and we're like oh we have
to pour it like really soon and then
they're like no too bad whatever so me
wait forever blubber bags are over so
we're like moving around stuff we go to
what we think is security and then it's
really customs what does it call busy
border like customs we would eat there
for 40 minutes and I was losing it we
were asking people were like hi like our
flight closes for like hours they
started for the a 9:30 really close that
like that it's like 20 minutes for now
if you really have to do them they're
being shown to us like not helpful
they're letting other people budget line
but like not us and we're like no so
when I grab leasing my mom and I was
like sorry I'm the worst right now but I
just march right to the front and then
we like get to the customs like people
and then the girl that wasn't helpful
and I'm so rude and like saw me budge
because we were gonna miss our flight
it came up to him and was like yelling
at them in French because she like
assumed none of us spoke French I knew
everything she was saying and she was
saying and I was literally like she was
like she was like hi so I'll make sure
you take your time with her her mom and
her sister because they didn't respect
the line and like just take your time
like literally like doesn't like what
the hell and then he's he literally she
was like with pleasure that pleasure I
was like I'm not an idiot it was about
to start fighting with him and I was
like I'm not gonna fight with it as a
pretty guy because we're never gonna
make it through I literally like loving
you gave me one pass where I was like I
should say something happy back like
like I'm glad you took your time or
something but then I was like Lucy
you're gonna miss your plane
I look so great that I got the head last
night
this has been your stress yes please so
we budget everyone to get through and
they were they were taking their time
they were like where is here um flight
here is you're putting one right on my
board yes so I'm like looking through my
email trying to show them the flights
that we came here like they're being
Sobers we get through and then we have
to take a train to our terminal because
the security is there then we get there
we get to our security it's 10:01 are
like close at 10:05 and I just watched
everyone again get through security
somehow three other security at Lucy's
luggage obviously good search we are
going up the escalator to run because
it's like m25 three I'm 50 and M 50 the
obviously the last one and that was our
game and we're like was running a flash
later and here our names and they're
like last call like Gretchen Garrity

like so then we were running like Lucy
so sweaty can you see so we're sprinting
Lucy's redcoats she's just like you
should have been jonesing for an extra
security check really and my friggin
cache she's like wiping it down I'm like
pretty sure there's nothing in there but
okay
look at my hair I can't believe a minute
but I was so excited I was like I've
lost all phase I was like being miss
eight playable you and me on this panel
I said like we're not gonna miss nice
very good okay so basically it was
subcommittee but I hate everyone like
what else can you do everyone I'm Craig
and we're leaving
like two hours later we were supposed to
guys I'm crying series of actually happy
because of teddy
you just make things so much better okay
yeah but basically we left the airport
like what you would have hours after we
there did like take a scientist accused
me I'll check them find a second to be
checked and out of our three suitcases
isn't fine obviously didn't go out the
flight even though it was like
in-between so that doesn't make sense me
and the lady if I got to tell that
baggage services but we'll be like an
hour and half after looking for my
suitcase on the carrot stuff she was
like I waited my forever Jews like
you're like people they're so heavy that
the plane would just be like over the
weight limit no just certainly throwing
suitcases off the plane so I probably
made it on the plane
well definitely did because it was like
the second out of three but then they
just like took it off they're not gonna
ship it to us they're just gonna fly it
back to Albany because she's like
honestly that'll be quicker if you can
just go pick it up and I was like it
needs to be here in time for Christmas
because Lucy's Christmas presents are in
there and I just kept crying for the
lady because I was like so hopefully
actually she said that she got a
notification that like all the luggage
was loaded onto the flight it's
literally leaving Paris right now and
it'll get into New York at 9 p.m.
tonight and then it can go on an Albany
flight like tomorrow morning or whatever
