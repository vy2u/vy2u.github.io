do-do-do-do-do my outfit really does not
make sense today but I tried are you
sure YouTube the dining hall no she was
in the other one we were talking about
me and Abby not having dates for day
party we were sitting right over there
and now we just went full circle because
today's a party and we still kind of
have date sorta he's tall he's six
thirty did you know that
so it's lip no literally that's like the
main thing when you're five nine
anywhere four-inch heels you're 6 1
sofie's how they use that you gave me
she's like are you wearing those again
Louise is literally wearing 6-inch heels
tonight no they're like thick I was we
had a ruler they're so tall they look so
good with the white
so we just finished finance we got our
tests back Krista's introduction it's
not appropriate and I'm living I'm happy
because whoa this is so broken yeah
you're right really that's really the
only issue but I'm not even mad because
I thought I did like 80 points worse so
yeah I'm not mad yeah I feel weird
I don't care ever when you walk on time
have you know you like theorem you know
like palms are sweaty knees weak knees
sweep it mom's sphaghetti blank on my
chest walk you down call back hold em
what number I got I would just cut it
right out of the video I would tell
nobody I bet you it
spitfires retching let's get a wrap
right now Christiani farthing
oh my god I'm so happy it's sending out
it's a great day I'm immersed in you you
should these go fast and that would be
part of like we're living oh yeah at the
end of the course they could also like
not annex exam but like yeah so I just
got back from class he saw us walking
back and we did hear back from our
finance exams none of our other core
exams just finance and didn't do great
but didn't do as bad as I thought so
I'd say I'm happy and related inside
it's totally fine and I'm like I had
like just all I try to remind myself is
that a couple years from now and none of
it is gonna matter at all you remember
what you got on your exams like I don't
even remember - I got my exams last
semester was really such a big deal back
then you want I mean so it's totally
fine you're struggling in school right
now
hang in there you got this like well all
make it through Sasha it's literally the
friend that knows everyone and it's good
but also bad because whenever we go
anywhere he stops 30 times along the way
and it takes like a million years to do
anything cuz you just have to stop and
talk to everyone look we were trying to
leave questrom and he stops in his
talking's like all these people I'm like
come on buddy I gotta get ready for day
party and then we're like walking back
and he stops and talked to so many
people we talked to like this new like
startup business forever that was giving
out water bottles and stuff and I'm like
I need to go buddy but um yeah so I'm
back and we start getting ready for date
party luckily I got my hair blown out
before class so that is done with I put
on lots of makeup earlier so if anything
I would just have to do like some
touch-up so this is like pretty much it
and this is my dress that I kind of
showed earlier what she's looking at how
it looks like
but I'm gonna show you and it's like
okay so guys put on my dress do you like
it it's from a honey bum I'm obsessed
with it I think it's so cute you'll see
butter in pictures and right now he tell
playing music eating tofu
I'm in tobu I'm kale and - potato I was
just I hit it up into bullets like
leftovers um I'm just like tired and
feeling like mad because I sup for
literally two hours last night but I had
like so much energy this morning excited
for my morning routine okay for date
money I was excited for like the day for
Drybar so my go-to is to just start
playing some jams and start jamming
because then you're ready to go so
that's all good doing that we're gonna
dance
are you ready for day fighting okay bye
