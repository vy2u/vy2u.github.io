today because if you can't tell I'm
actually home right now and this is like
it's so weird to be home honestly from
Boston University because I've been home
and like over a month and it just like
my room feels different and like the
furniture feels shorter because my bed
and stuff is so high up in my dorm room
it's kind of weird but I don't know it
just like it feels different but it's
like so awesome to be home and like see
my mom and my dad I'd miss him so much
and my dog Ozzy like I literally miss my
dog
way more than I thought I would and
right now actually I'm filming with like
the back camera not the front camera on
my phone because a front camera it was
being like blurry even kind of weird so
if it's not really like on my face
perfectly sorry that's why I can't see
myself I thought it would be fun to vlog
today because Lucy and I are home for
Columbus Day weekend and I'm really
sorry I'm apologizing in advance I know
this is not going to go up really close
to Columbus Day weekend just because I
have so many videos like backed up that
I need to upload it's just really hard
to find time and like edit them all with
college and everything but I'm not
complaining I love YouTube but I'm also
gonna like prioritize my academics and
everything so just getting that out the
way so today's Sunday the day before
Columbus Day we actually have to leave
to go back to Moscow University tomorrow
morning to get back in time for practice
and today we're just gonna go apple
picking and I thought it'd be fun to
bring you guys along I haven't walked in
a while so this should be really fun I
thought it'd be good to show you my
outfit so I'm just saying this gray
sweater with the white little stripes on
my sleeves from brandy melville and I'm
wearing some up black leggings and some
fuzzy striped socks I'm sorry there's
like clothes all over the ground
I know where my new hunter rain boots
too guys my hair's finally like growing
too and so happy I wanted to be along
again but we're gonna curl my hair real
quick curl it might took like literally
five minutes like I can call my hair so
quick and if you go to any of my other
like kidding money videos with me
cutting my hair you'll see how to do
this I thought I would just spare you
the time I've seen you do it and I'm
gonna take an intermission of getting
ready to go get some pancakes just
Lucy's making pancakes I'm so excited
thank you
cakes pancakes pancakes yeah I miss
pancakes ready yes I did thank you yes
Rosie wants me to fill my raspberries

some reason the front ones blurry I
think like my screen protector is kind
of in the way of it

start to the day but we all slept in
