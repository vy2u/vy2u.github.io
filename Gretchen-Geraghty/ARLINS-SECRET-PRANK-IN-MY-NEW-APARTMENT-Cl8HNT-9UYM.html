so comfy then like you guys know me you
know I always wake up and like don't
have a voice I don't know why like every
day no matter what if I'm tired if I
stop saying like just always girls like
that too and what does it mean let me
know and like I feel like if it gets
passed like mmm 11 p.m. the same thing
happens like every night I don't know
wait guys could I just found with me and
Hagee get her eyelashes done yesterday
feel like we're never do you get them to
make kind of I'll take if I don't make
my voice higher I think this is like
that so you can hear me okay wait I'm
back again I just want to let you know
how big Emma's room actually is like
look at it it's it's like echo like I've
never had a room this big and I was like
thinking that I thought I would be like
cos you know you like see seven people's
clear like in videos and stuff the
copper you say oh I saw their house and
like their vlogs but then like being in
real life I'm like well guys I have to
show you something really important in
Maggie's house please focus
I just want to squeeze a little cheese
you look so let's go see that one she's
holding Tinkerbell I guess how that was
her her hair is like lighter
you know whew she's so cute
I wish me an eclair she's really cute so
mushy city is this you this doesn't even
look like you when you're playing hockey
that straight it doesn't look like you
talk to you that's so funny
there's one of you and Emma through the
window is like you too I love that
picture of you guys
it's so cute yeah in Boston I feel like
I've seen this one before of you and I'm
on your brother it's so cute
we're getting this show on the road
I feel like Emma cuz Emma always logs in
the kitchen this is like Emma's everyday
life but it's me day in the life of Emma
Emma with a twist when I'm wearing the
Arlen war
t-shirt okay guys this is how you make
toast step one put bread and the scoops
this is my last bite but I wanted to
tell you that I just realized cinnamon
raisin toasted plain is so good alright
never know because it's literally just
stuffing on it but it's good by
McDonald's house I'm literally gonna
come back Tuesday cuz I miss you already
let's get it
wait this morning MSNBC snapchat and she
was like bye little Coco of my car I
know I'm always like I don't think I
should show the license plate he's so
cute so now I'm off to Boston I've been
driving it so much recently in my new
car you guys know like I literally live
in here I feel like ever since I've got
and I've just been driving so much so
what I wanted to talk to you guys about
I literally feel like arlynn more right
now but I wanted to talk to you guys
about audible because I have been
listening to audiobooks like way more
than I used to just because now I have a
car so I've been driving like such long
drives like to Long Island and back back
to Albany basically I've just been
listening to audible audiobooks just
because it like fills the time and makes
it go by so much quicker than you know
if I didn't so
yeah it's weird because I feel like I
didn't really use to listen to
audiobooks but now since I have a car
and like you can literally listen them
for so many different occasions like you
can listen to them when you go hiking I
know
arlynn always listens to them on planes
he listens to them when he works out but
yeah so I have been listening to a big
little lies I don't know if you guys
know this show big little lies but I
actually started listening to it I
remember like in one month I got like
four books at once like I got like a
Tina Fey one because I think she's so
funny and you can use audible.com/anna
to start your 30-day free trial and you
can get your first audio book for free
and you can also text scratch into five
zero zero five zero zero to get the same
offer so yeah don't forget to do that if
you're interested like I said I like
that you get like a free book every
month with your membership but um if you
are really busy at that month or you
don't listen to an audiobook you
couldn't roll over to like the next
month so like I said I literally got
like four and one month at one time so I
just got back to Boston finally the
drive wasn't by powders a lot bad
actually going to because there's so
much traffic going there but coming back
wasn't too bad especially with audible
so again you can use audible.com slash
Gretchen to get your 30 day trial and
first book for free or you can text
Gretchen at two five zero zero five zero
zero
and yeah I just really loved it big
little lies because there's like so much
drama and like a mystery and stuff if
you guys I won't like ruin it for you
but if you haven't seen the show where
like heard the book or read the book
definitely I would recommend and now
