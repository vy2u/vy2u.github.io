ear pods I actually ran Maggie even
spared me yeah I walked for like five
minutes on my Gretchen come on and then
I ran but um what's they even say oh
these works for walking and running I
know they're gonna fall out but then it
hit me I was like these are like normal
like apple headphones just without the
cord so why would they fall out and yeah
and then I just dropped one and thought
that it was gonna be in the gym but I
just found it outside our door yeah I
got like always bring the case with them
