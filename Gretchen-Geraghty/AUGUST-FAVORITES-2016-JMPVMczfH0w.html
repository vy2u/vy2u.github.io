video for you guys because I haven't
done my favorites video and I can't even
tell you how long but I always loved
watching them on YouTube but they're so
interesting to me just to see what
people are actually liking right now so
you can really tell what they like and
then you can link it to you know what I
mean
cuz hauls are fun because you can like
show what you get but you don't know if
the person actually likes it yet but in
favorites you see their opinion so
anyway I just really think favorites are
very like helpful and I love watching
them so I figured out make them for you
guys and some are kind of funny because
literally I just showed you what I've
been loving for the month of August also
by the way I got this necklace yesterday
and I'm seriously freaking out I love it
so much it's just the David Yurman like
clear one so anyway if I get any
questions about that so my first
favorite for the month of August is 50
and it's just this 28 day detox tea and
what I really like about this is it's a
hundred percent natural it helps
increase your energy levels which I
seriously love because I always feel
like I'm just kind of groggy and like
lit so this is so great because it
actually helps increase your energy
levels but it doesn't give you like the
jitters like sugar but you know so it
just increases your energy levels like
naturally I'm probably my favorite thing
about detox tea is that it helps remove
toxins from your body which i think is
so good w just detoxify and like relax
and just get all the bad things out so
that you can be like more healthy and
energized and I just think this is a
really good thing also a bonus is that
they actually have a worldwide shipping
so I know sometimes it can be hard
especially for some of my viewers that
are international it must be hard when
I'm talking about certain products and
you can't get them but this does ship
internationally which is so nice so
thank you 58 for sponsoring this video
and I don't have it linked down below in
case you are interested ok my second
favorite I can't actually show you right
now but I made one for breakfast this
morning like I do every day
so I'll insert a clipper right here and
basically just acai bowls or like really
smoothie bowls of any kind if you guys
watch my blogs my blogs channel my twin
sister Lucy is a Gretchen and Lucy
definitely go check it out and youtube
if you're not subscribed but i basically
show like me it needs to be bowls and
acai bowls like every single day because
they're just my favorite ever they taste
so good and I'm not kidding for those of
you that you thin like really like me
like do you know what I mean like you
seriously get addicted like it's an
addiction I'm not kidding like every day
I was morning I'm like I want this
Olivia Bullock I just always want I can
do one for every single meal I just love
them I taste so good and you want to
know more
like what I put in them and what I put
on them and how I make them and
everything go watch my vlog Channel I
actually just posted a vlog that's like
acai bowl FAQ is because people always
ask us like how we make them and what we
put in them and everything basically
they just taste amazing if you've never
had one I love them yes yes that's all I
can say they're so good
and in the majority my favorites are
actually in Beauty favorites because I
think I've been saying this in the past
couple videos of mine but I've been
getting into beauty like way more
recently like I used to not wear this
much makeup at all and this soul isn't
even like a lot but it's just basically
what I've been doing like day-to-day
when I am wearing makeup and I like love
putting on makeup it's just so fun and I
make more makeup like it's a class this
year like that's what I think about
going back to the college I'm like I'm
gonna wear my makeup when I go to class
and like feel like productive but anyway
I'm actually filming it everyday makeup
routine video or the tutorial even cuz I
want to show you like what I'm doing but
um I think when if I'm not tomorrow so
this look will be filmed soon in case
you're interested about it keep an eye
out but anyway and my third favorite is
a beauty favorite which is kind of funny
it's just this little mini Beauty
Blender like I seriously look at how
cute this says it's so cute and the
reason this is a favorite is because I
use it to blend in my under-eye
concealer and for any of you that have
this and use this to blend your under
eye concealer do you get it wet because
I don't get it wet I just use it to like
blend it in normally but when I use my
normal Beauty Blender for my foundation
I get it wet and use it but this one I
don't okay my fourth favorite is also
kind of funny too in distress visit
brush and this is actually the Luxy
angled top buffer brush and i've never
had luck see brushes before i went to
beauty con LA and i actually add a bunch
in the town lounge so i got like five of
them in this little Sam I'm so thankful
that I got them and this is just like I
said the angled kabuki brush and the
reason this is a favorite is also kind
of funny because you would think I put
makeup on with it and I don't I use it
to put on moisturizer as you can see I
just usually use when my Cetaphil
moisturizing and I just buff it in on my
face I really use any moisturizer though
look at the bunch I've been using like
this neat 16:01 too and like really any
one I'll use it like before I put on
makeup before I go to bed and I just use
Vista buff it in because I feel more
clean like I seriously you think I'm
gonna get germaphobe in like going
insane but usually I would just
obviously if my fingers like rub in my
moisturizer on my face
but I like using this because I feel
like it's more clean just using like a
brush and knowingly
and I like that my fingers don't get all
sticky for my moisturizer like I need me
like me like I feel like I'm crazy but I
really just like using this to blend mo
moisturizer my favorite I think I'm very
late on the bandwagon but I think I
might have shown this in a whole video
there's just the shade opal it's the
Becca highlighter and I think a lot of
people have the opal one or champagne
bob is am I thinking the right thing I
think so and basically it's just this
beautiful shimmering highlighter and I
love it I always wear it like every day
up on my cheekbones and this thing is
just gold like it is I don't even know
how to describe it I've tried other
highlighters but this is by far the best
so if you haven't tried it you just have
to try it yourself because I love it my
sixth favorite is still a beauty
favorite and this is just the Laura
Mercier translucent right Laura Mercier
Laura Mercier oh my gosh I don't notice
it but it is just the translucent powder
and I also feel like I'm late on this -
like I feel like everyone uses this and
it's basically just this translucent
powder and the reason I like it is
because I like to use it under my eyes
over my under eye concealer then I use
my little mini Beauty Blender to apply
and I just use this to kind of like bake
my under eyes I think I'm doing it right
I hope I am if any of you have a better
way to like bake your under eyes these
like a sponge or a Beauty Blender I
don't know but usually I just put a lot
on with like a big fluffy brush and I
let it sit a bit and then I sweep it
away and blend it into my skin because I
just like the way that looks and I think
it helps keep my under eyes light and I
really like the way it looks with like
light under eye area you know my seventh
favorite is still a beauty favorite and
this is just the Chanel bronzer it is
the tan Deschanel Soleil I don't even
know what I'm saying
but yeah just this one and it smells
really good by the way and I usually
just put this on with like a stippling
brush and I really like the way it just
gives you like a sunkissed goddess look
is the way I think of it I just put up
in my forehead and like my cheekbones
and like blend it under my jawline and I
love it so yeah that is definitely been
a favorite for the month of August
number eight my last Beauty favorite is
the L'Oreal Paris magic skin at
beautifier BB cream in the shade medium
I actually just grabbed this from CVS
when I went shopping with Lucy and my
grandma I did go makeup shopping and I
thought I would just try it out because
I thought I like heard of it before and
I love this I really did fall in love
and I love that it just blends into your
skin color because it's like white at
first you know and it magically like
turns to your skin color I heard it
actually just turns to the color medium
but regardless I just
really like the way it looks at my skin
and I like it because it doesn't feel
heavy like a foundation like I don't
like feeling really heavy like liquid
foundation on my face you know so I
really like the way this feels and I
think it looks pretty nice my ninth
favorite is a pair of sunglasses and did
I show these in a hole I think I did
there are these Kate Spade sunglasses
that I got when I was in LA and just
look at them they are so fab I just love
them they're like so huge and I feel
like my friends and people I know we're
like don't get them Gretchen those are
huge and crazy you don't need them but
like I don't even care because I just
love them and I just think they're
fabulous so yeah but my last favorite is
kind of funny but I just did a white
fluffy blanket from society6 and it's
this elephant print one and I just love
it because it's so snuggly soft and cozy
and I showed this in my dorm haul video
and I just loved it because it seriously
so soft and like every night I'll be
like on my bed chillin like editing
videos or like watching Netflix or
something and I always like curl up in
this blanket cuz it's so soft and I know
it's coming to college with me because I
can't part with it and I just love it
like every single thing I showed in this
video I'm like I just love it like
obviously you love it Gretchen it to
your favorites video so yeah that is
everything I have for my August
favorites video and if I can find the
links to these things I will link them
down below in case you guys are
interested so you can like check them
