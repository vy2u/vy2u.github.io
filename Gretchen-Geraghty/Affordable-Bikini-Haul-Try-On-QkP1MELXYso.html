affordable bikini haul for you guys
because I know I had one recently that
had some pretty pricey bikinis and I saw
a lot of comments that you guys were
saying like oh look I love these bikinis
but they're sort of out of my price
range and as you guys know I'm obsessed
with bikinis I just love bathing suits
so I literally buy so many and for me
it's worth it if I save up and get them
because I work as a lifeguard and I
lifeguard at a private pool so I'm
allowed to wear a bikini when I
lifeguard so I literally wear all of
them all the bikinis I'm going to be
showing you are from this website called
saffle I'll have all these dates listed
down below and I have a bunch to share
with you guys like I got so many so you
can see what they're like in when I say
these are affordable they are so
affordable like all of them are so cheap
they're usually between like 10 are like
$15 I'm pretty sure I just threw them
all in this huge bag I think I have like
17 sorry if it's windy at all during
this video too since I'm obviously
filming on my back porch I sort of put
all these bathing suits in order of my
favorites so this first one is my
absolute favorite I am just obsessed
with it it just has this beautiful
crochet detailing at the top since it's
like this little halter top and it's
just all black it's so beautiful and I
know they have one that looks just like
this that like packs on that my cousin
has and it literally looks the same and
this one was so much cheaper and then
the bottoms just look like this they're
all black bottoms and I really like
these bottoms because they have a little
cut up beside it just is really cute and
flattering I think like I said this is
absolutely my favorite I just love the
top I think it's so pretty and then next
up which is my second favorite which I
didn't even think I would like that much
but I absolutely love it and if you guys
watched my vlogs you would have seen
this already it's just this all red one
if you don't watch my blogs you should
my blog channel is my twin sister is
called Gretchen and Lucy's you should go
watch her fry vlogs and subscribe I
think they're really fun you could just
see more of like my personality then
instead of just like clothes and trying
on bathing suits you know but anyway
like I said this is just all red
I really like the ruffling detail I just
think it makes it look so pretty and the
bottoms are again just all red with some
ruffles I really like the bottoms too
that are like side tie ones like this
and for size reference I know their
website is kind of confusing with all
the different sizing charts like I was
so confused with which ones to get in
all of these fit me and I got a size
small in all of them and then this next
one I have to show you guys is seriously
so beautiful it's just all white for
these pink and blue flowers I just love
the floral details I think it's so
beautiful and I love how it's all
strappy like that in the back and then I
just have the bottoms to match which are
again like the floral print with the
white background and I like the little
strings on the side too and then this
next one is just an all black footage so
pretty and unique and different because
a like Criss crosses like that in the
front I just love the way it Criss
crosses like that like I think it looks
so beautiful and then the bottoms are
just all black tie bottom so I was sort
of scared of the quality since obviously
these bathing suits are a lot cheaper
than maybe one to buy like in store but
literally the quality of all these are
so good like it's so much better than I
would have expected you this next one I
have to show you is just this maroon one
that is again I really like these like
strappy details
it just has like strappy straps like
that and I love the back it's so
beautiful with like the braided detail
down the middle of your back and I
really like these bottoms are a little
more cheeky I like cheeky bottoms here
but can get to Han and just has the
strappy detail on the side and I really
like this maroon bathing suit because I
did have a roommate in suit or
renovating to like I showed this red
bathing suit before so I like getting
new colors that I haven't tried before
because they turn out to be my favorite
and this next one I have to show you is
seriously so cute I realized I really
love the style of this top it's just
this pink printed top kind of like a
paisley print and again I love like the
strappy detailing in the middle it's
just so cute this was like really
flattering like I just think it would
look good on like everyone and then the
bottoms are just the bottoms to match
same paisley print and I don't know
about you guys but I've seen these type
of like crochet bikinis like all over
Instagram and I always thought they were
so cute I think there's just one more
like really expensive brand that sells
them but these ones literally look just
like all the expensive ones I've seen on
Instagram and they're so much cheaper I
got like an orange one a Maine blue
green one and a white one and I'm going
to show the white one later but the
first one is just this orange one this
one
doesn't have padding like pretty much
all the other ones have pads but this
top doesn't have padding but I mean that
doesn't really bother me just to like no
and just has this really cool crochet
like strap detailing I just love the way
it looked and then the matching bottoms
just look like this also - what's nice
is this is like stretchy some of these
crochet bikinis like this aren't
stretchy but this one is so that's
really nice and this next one is just
this mint green one and the only thing
weird I have to say about this one is it
smells really weird and it came like oh
it just smells like old like it's like
been sitting there for a while so I'm
definitely have to wash it I don't know
why it smells weird but this is
definitely one of my favorites too
because I just think it's so pretty on
and again I just love like the crochet
detailing you guys know I like love mint
green so this aqua blue color is like my
life and I just have the same matching
bottoms also - these are nice really
stretchy and I just have this orange
bikini set which i think is so cute I
love how it has the different color
stitching I think it makes it really
unique and pretty and again I really
like the cut of this because I just
think it's really flattering and I just
have the bottoms to match and like I
said about those crochet bikinis I have
it in white as well but this is like
random one that fits weirdly smaller
than all the rest even though all of
them are size small this is - but it's
really tight I don't know if you can
tell what I'm trying on but yeah it's
like pretty tight this one doesn't have
padding's as well just this one in the
orange one tome the mint green one had
padding but I still think this is so
pretty and maybe I'll just have like
squishing - I especially like the colors
of the white one and I just have the
bottoms to match on if you can tell - by
me just holding it up but these really
definitely tighter on either than the
other ones and they're still stretchy
but like it can only stretch so far you
know so I might just have to squish into
this a couple times since it's really
cute and I have this halter like leaf
print one which I think is so cool
I was sort of hesitant about halter tops
for all because I didn't know how I'd
feel about wearing like a halter bikini
and I don't want like tan lines up to
here but I probably just won't wear them
when I'm like tanning you know I'll just
wear it for like fun if I'm not going to
be in the Sun that much maybe if it's
like more cloudy you know but this one I
think is such a fun print I love how it
crosses in the back like that I think
anything that Criss crosses in the back
like that instantly becomes more
flattering I keep saying everything's
flattering but these bikinis I was just
kind of skeptical that they are so cheap
but they're actually like really nice
and I really like the way they look on
and I really like the bottoms on these
ones they're just the bottom smash but I
remember like a weekend or two in like
Georgia I was with Justin and his sister
Jacqueline and her friend
Sara I had these leaf print bottoms that
I thought were so pretty and she was
just wearing like a plain black top so
ever since that I wanted like leaf
bottom so I'm really happy I caught
those and then I got another kind of
leafy print one but it's different
because it has like a white background
just like in a triangle top and then I
have the matching bottoms and I like
these two they're a little more cheek
piece you can wear with your tanning I
really like this one this is more like a
dark green leaf print and this is more
with a lighter one and then I have to
show you is again in this really cute
top style I realized I just like I said
before really like the style of top this
is just a light blue like Daisy print
with again like straps in the middle as
you guys can tell just really like all
this strappy detail items on things I
think they make it look really cool and
I like the yellow ties on it too I think
that's really cute and again I just have
the matching bottoms I mean this one's
really fun in like summery looking and
last minute I have to show you or just
not my favorite and I will explain why
for several reasons so I just got this
blue and white tie-dye one and I thought
it looked so cute on the model but on me
I just the top I don't know why I'm just
not so crazy about lines that come right
here and a little cutout in the middle I
just think it doesn't look that good on
me but it's still cute like I probably
will wear it but I do love how the back
has all those strings like I said before
and I also really like the bottoms
because they have all the strappy
detailing on the side and they're just
like blue and white tie-dye print so
I'll probably lower them bottoms more
like maybe a plain white top and this
next one is just a navy blue and white
stripe and oh top with red detailing the
reason I don't like this one so much is
because I don't know how I feel about
all the colors together like red and
navy blue and white and very patriotic
though so you could wear it for like the
fourth of July so I really do like the
cut of this one now look I like the
bando style top and then the bottoms
just to match them okay and then this
one I don't know what went wrong with
this bathing suit but the top is so
weird I thought it looks really good on
the model but on me like as you guys can
tell something is going on the cups like
they go out like really far and like
pointed like the cups are literally
pointed I'm like okay that's like not
flattering but what
and it's just white and it has like
black straps but the one thing I love
about this agency are the bottoms I
seriously love the bottoms like I know
I'll just wear these on their own
because I love that detail right there
it just looks so cool hella cross in the
front like that with the black and the
white so I know I'll get a lot of use
out of the bottom I just don't really
know about the top only one more left so
at the very last one I have to show you
is interesting the top is just this
light baby pink color and I just don't
really know if I like how the top fits
like that there's like all these straps
and it like crosses twice in the back
and I don't know it's just all opened in
the middle so the top is kind of weird
and in the bottom it's no I like this
strappy detail on the side for the
bottoms but these are kind of extreme
and they go like high-waisted and I
don't know if I want tan lines up to my
bellybutton you know but I mean I guess
if you like like high-waisted bottoms
like these are still really cute and I
do like the details on the side I just
don't know if that's really me but this
one's still nice so that is it for my
Tryon swimsuit haul video I really hope
you guys appreciated this one because I
tried to pick obviously more like
affordable bikinis to show you and like
I said since they're all from Zappos

can check them out if you're interested
give this video a thumbs up if you like
Tryon halls because they take me a lot
longer like I always say but I know it's
really helpful when you can see how
something like fits someone else too may
be configuring what I'm saying yeah
