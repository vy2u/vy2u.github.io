be a pretty quick video and it's just
going to be my Alex and Ani collection

have and if I'm super requested so I
hope you enjoy let's get into it yeah so
like sue me win for this part you can
like see all the little charms this
first one as you can see right here is
this little like shell with a pearl in
it it's like an oyster and I got it over
the summer it was a good charm of the
month I remember and I just thought it
was really pretty with like the pearl in
there so that is that one I guess I'll
like take them off as I go along these
are in no particular order either and I
also wear like the gold ones and the
silver ones like with each other I look
on top of each other just because I
don't really care if they mix and match
and I think it actually looks cute too
but this is actually the first one I've
ever gotten and it is the cupcake one
and Justin got it for me for my birthday
like last year so yeah I really really
like that one - it's like silver and I
don't know what these needs are even
know when you get them they come a
little card that says the little words
that they mean I don't know what they
mean but I'm sure you can like lick them
up if you want to oh well this one
reminds me of Tasha so this one I got
with Tasha over the summer she got a
gold tea and I got a gold gt4 Tasha with
G for Gretchen and I just really liked
it because it's like my initial so I
think these are super cute and everyone
should like get their initials and we
can be twins with our matching gold in
the show Alex and Audis because I love
them and this one I love - okay honest
look I love all of these so Who am I
kidding but this one I think is so cute
and it's this little silver monkey charm
and Justin actually got it for me for
our six-month anniversary and I like
love it it's so cute and we always have
this joke and say that Justin - monkey
so it's like a little J bow just chillin
in my arm I think it's so adorable and I
love monkeys team and this one I
actually just tweeted a picture of like
yesterday I think this is a little gold
Ruba bracelet and Justin got this for me
when he was in Aruba I think actually a
lot of these Justin got for me just for
like different occasions and like
holidays and stuff but just think got
this for me while he was in Aruba
because he just got back from vacation
there so I'm so thankful that he got me
this and
listen to you it has a Little Debbie
tree I'm gonna call it did me Oh Divya
that's what they're called have a little
dippy tree on it and it's like a tree of
aruba that girls like sideways so I
think that's really special and I like
that a lot
obvious when I love is well this is a
half of a heart it says best it's silver
and I actually have with my twin sister
Lucy who has the silver one that says
friends so yeah Lucy and I just have
these make say best friends they like
interlock because Lucy truly is my best
friend she's my twin but she's also my
best friend then this silver one is a
little silver seahorse and I think I got
this for myself over the summer as well
if you watch my 50 things you didn't
know about me I will link it down below
if you haven't seen it but I said that
when I was little I always your streets
see horses all the time so I really like
seahorses I think they're cute so I got
this little silver skewers over the
summer and I think it's super adorable
this one I know I also got over the
summer it's this gold ice-cream cone it
actually reminds me of summer because
look at ice-cream cone I like it it's
super cute I mean this last one brings
back a really fun memory to dressing got
me this one when he asked me to prom
last year I think I think I put a
picture on Instagram when he asked me he
asked me with my favorite cookies those
peanut butter ones with the chocolate
kisses on top he spelled out prom with
like a million of those cookies it was
like super big and it was a question
market at the end of the question mark
was this Alex and Ani which has an
elephant and elephants are my favorite
animals so I love this one too so yeah

below because I would love to know if we
have the same ones and if you don't have
the same ones but if you liked some of
