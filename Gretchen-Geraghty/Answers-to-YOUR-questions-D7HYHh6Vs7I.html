answers to the questions you asked like
three days ago I'll try to get through
as many as I can and um yeah so let's
just get ready to it what grade are you
in I'm in 10th grade what do you order
at starbucks I think like a Frappuccino
like strawberries strawberries and cream
something oh I always get lemon pound
cake okay what is your favorite clothing
and makeup store forever 21 Urban
Outfitters H&amp;amp;M is nice garage like the
stores in New York City like Topshop
brandy melville obviously their stuff is
so cute makeup store would probably be
sephora i like mac but i like Heather so
many brands as before and I feel like I
by way more stuff at sephora than mac
you're so pretty oh thank you um how do
you get your hair so long and healthy my
hair is pretty long if you guys didn't
know actually it's kind of shorter when
I curl it so it's kind of short today I
don't know um but long really just comes
with time work you have to be patient I
don't get my hair cut that much like it
all look I just got mine cut probably a
month ago and she cut off like two
inches which was way more than I wanted
but I haven't got my haircut in over a
year so that's why I'm i decided i just
had to get it cut and like healthy i'm
really not healthy with my hair I know
you're supposed to use like heat
protectant I do on a Cajun but look
today I didn't and I pretty much you see
on my hair every day which I know isn't
a good thing like when I don't have to I
try not to but pretty much at school I
like to look nice so are you see down my
hair every day it's kind of just like
your hair like everyone's hair is
different so you just have to know your
hair and what it can put up with is kind
of what I'm saying but yeah definitely
be patient like growing out your hair
takes time and that's probably the
biggest thing favorite face products I
think I'm going to do and I've done it
updated foundation routine soon um
because I haven't done one in a while
and my skin aren't hope you guys have
noticed but it used to be so bad like
I'd really really bad acne but it's
finally finally getting better than
medicine that I've been using I'm
finally trying to see results with my
skin
clearing up McCallum learned today is
literally concealer under my eyes and
powder like I'm not even wearing
foundation so my skin is getting a lot
better they face products would probably
just be the foam concealer it's in the
little pot that's great I use it I'm
like one wishes and underneath my eyes
and I really love it the bottom I know
they discontinued selling it at sephora
and I don't know why because I really
love it I love their blushes too but you
can I think you can get it on their
website like the bomb and sometimes they
have it on hautelook so that's really
great and then face powder I always
always always use my mac studio fix
powder foundation and I love it it's
like a pretty full coverage powder and
it's really nice in it like keeps me
Matt throughout the day cuz I've oily
skin so yeah those are probably my
favorite face products what is your
favorite clothing brand thinking about
it probably brandy melville like I don't
have that much stuff from them but I
love all of their stuff and this is
really great if you are able to travel
one place in the world you have never
been before where would it be by the way
you're gorgeous and I love your videos
thank you okay um where I haven't been
it would be Australia because it's so
far away and that's just like
fascinating to me how far away it is so
I definitely go there what's your
favorite store brandy melville maybe I
don't know what's your score for a2k and
crew / 500 meters it's probably probably
a little over two minutes like 20 5 204
somewhere in there I'm not I really
don't know where I stand look if that's
like amazing or not that good but I've
been doing crew for a little while and I
really enjoy it you remind me of Laurel
from The Lying you I've actually heard
that before so yeah I don't know tell me
what you think do I don't really think I
look like her I don't think I look like
anyone like famous or anything but I
guess maybe a little maybe cuz okay I
pretty much get compared to anyone that
has blonde hair because I blonde hair
like yeah whatever what are your
favorite products from the drugstore and
high-end drugstore mascaras they're like
amazing like all of them like i don't
think i would ever spend that much money
on a high-end one again cuz i don't
think they're worth it like i loved
loved loved L'Oreal telescopic I got
that from miss Kelly Marie 16 here on
YouTube so if you watch her videos
she's one that recommended L'Oreal
telescopic and then like all the
Maybelline ones are pretty much
fantastic like they have really great
ones to high-end would be high in
foundations like a really good thing to
invest in like to make up forever HD
foundation I use the tart um full
coverage Amazonian clay one I love that
one and yeah like Haiyan would probably
just be like foundations like I shadows
are worth it like the naked palettes
what is your dream job probably to be an
orthodontist I know that's like what
that's weird but I think when I'm older
I want to be an orthodontist so that
would be my dream job so I was Michael
okay where do you like to shop for jeans
or shorts on my jeans and shorts are
pretty much forever combi because I like
their genes with us how old are you I'm
15 years old what's your favorite
underdog high-end and drugstore product
high-end would be the Tarte Amazonian
clay I don't think that many people have
really talked about it so yeah that's
like amazing and then drugstore would
have to be mascaras in general I don't
know if telescopic has talked about that
much what's your favorite types of
perfume like fruity etc well my favorite
perfumes are i just bought on well like
around Christmas time i bought dolce &amp;amp;
gabbana light blue i love that if you
were my friend you know like i have a
little one I have the big one I spray
all of me all the time I'm pretty mature
it every day I love dolce &amp;amp; gabbana
light blue and i also love dior addict
to life i got it in a sample and i had
to buy it so I'm like obsessed with that
when I also like um aqua Lena's pink
sugar so those are all kind of like
those are like one extreme to the other
cuz pink sugars like really sweet but
then the other ones are more like musky
so I pretty much like a lot of different
types of sense look I can't really like
narrow down if you could go anywhere in
the world where would you go and why
probably Australia because I've never
been there or actually I really love the
Caribbean so maybe there what are two of
your favorite songs in movies take a
walk by passion pit because I just went
to other concerts and maybe like sleepy
head or like daylight or something
passion pit's awesome let's just like
off the top of my head and then movies
she's man has always been like my
favorite movie cuz since
younger I love that oh the lizzie
mcguire movie I'm such a chum what do
you like horror movies no I hate them
i'm pretty sure i've said that before i
hate horror movies they scare the death
out of me the death the life out of me
what ok but i like won't wash them ever
my friends love them and i seriously sit
there in a little bowl when I cry
because I won't watch it what is your
favorite nail polish probably not just
one in general but i really like Essie
nail polish like I like the brush I have
a lot of those maybe I'll do it nail
polish collection soon comment below if
you would like a nail polish collection
what is your favorite thing about being
on YouTube least favorite thing probably
my favorite thing is I just really
wanted to do this for like a while
because um it just looks like a lot of
fun and I have fun making these videos
and I love like um getting people's
feedback and like people's comments
because I just like helping you guys out
and doing what you like I like making
these videos because they're fun for me
to make and I like interacting with like
other girls and I don't know there is
just like a fun thing to do and I know
what can like help some other people so
that's a good thing least favorite thing
would probably just be um like no one at
my school really knows about my videos
um because it's kind of like a weird
thing like I don't think anyone would
really understand or get why I do them
or like get it like that's kind of weird
like why I should make videos on youtube
so that's probably my least favorite
thing obviously some people are starting
to find out and people would find out
one day but like now no one really knows
and I'm okay with that so yeah if you
could change your name what would you
change it to I think I like Gretchen I
guess it suits me if I wasn't Gretchen
my name was gonna be Heather so that's a
swim into I don't know what is your
favorite type of videos to make outfit
of the day after the week halls makeup
routine hair etc probably it would be a
makeup routine only because I love
watching makeup routine so probably when
I was making one if I made one I would
like love it because I know that people
like watching it I don't know make up
routines are my favorite videos to watch
I don't know about you guys what screw
oh it's basically just like rowing and a
boat for a sport and here with other
girls usually unless you're in a single
or double and I don't know you just row
and you raise people and it's really fun
and you get like a really good workout
and I'd like to go to Lake College for
that someday so yeah that's basically
crew I don't know like rowing was your
celebrity crush Liam Hemsworth he's
really cute Oh Channing Tatum oh I love
him I've always loved him since he's and
she's the man and I just said that was
my favorite movie so ya won't to
represent what you live by what would
the quote be oh that is a deep one
probably it would be carpe diem only
because my dad always used to say that
and I think that applies to like a lot
of things in life because it just means
seize the day in Latin and it kind of
just means like live your life to the
fullest and don't ever like take
anything for granted like seize the day
like live like every day is your last
and totally take advantage of the moment
and don't I don't know don't put off
anything that you wouldn't want to like
litter like you know just like be a
great person and do what you want to do
and that will make you with happy that's
kind of what carpe diem means i'm pretty
