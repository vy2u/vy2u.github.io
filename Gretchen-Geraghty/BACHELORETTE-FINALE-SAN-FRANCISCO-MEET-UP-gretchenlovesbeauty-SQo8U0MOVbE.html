you know I go out my place and like a
size four and then they grab it for you
and I put it in a real India's dressing
rooms are so cool like why so I just got
my name it's like a literally room
looking out like a dressing room it's
like closed off you know what I mean and
then right here it says find your light
plug in your music and let your mirror
face run wild you know it's like you can
like change the lighting or something
seriously how cute is this place like
what and she's like all the items you
picked her in your wardrobe okay let's
try it out no way you're like changes
awaiting did you see that be thick basic
that was cool we just had really cool
it's like chill vibes it's like very
blue golden is what we started off with
must be kind of like orange e yep
and then sexy time oh it's like just a
mirror light and not like top ones
anymore please it's so cool I literally
can plug in my phone and play music like
to dry the gloves do that's so funny you
have like a little fashion shoving here
you're like you can practice your walk
I'm gonna try and call his now and stop
being weird but basically everyone needs
to copy Reformation because this
dressing room is like an experience oh
and she said that I could like play
around on hee
I think no way it's like touch screen TV
or something these jeans I wanted and I
think if I click try it on she comes and
brings it to me oh it's like a literally
like their website in here you can like
see stuff oh my god this place is so
cool
Reformation you're doing your dressing
rooms very well and everyone should take
a lesson from you know ten out of ten
actually 11 out of 10
wait oh my god I need this dress how
flippin cute is that especially with
those little espadrilles guys this top
is exactly what I've been looking for
ever since Lucy and I saw row knees that
her name the Victoria Secret model she
just started to youtube channel videos
were so cute we watched her vlogs and
she was wearing a white button-up like
this I was really like relaxed looking
you just had some I layered gold mine
okay that's one first you're getting
this because just love this but I want
it in green and I'm definitely getting
this time to get you off of the day
these are from Zara and then this tank
top is from salt boutique and then tuck
it and I showed it in a recent home
video if you want to know the brand
because I forget what it is P huh
alright guys so mean Tosha
you really messed up and thought that it
started at 9 but it started at 8 so now
we realized because we decided an hour
late that Eric didn't make it but we
both thought that was gonna be Peter
Brian anyway and all of our friends over
on the East Coast already know so my
phone is bad on airplane mode for the
best like 20 minutes it's gonna stay
that way for the next two hours because
I don't want to know so yeah Rachel
looks so pretty she's in such good shape
I always notice her arms her arms are so
nice arm goals guys and I just have a
shower nice toilet brush my hair and
whose hair looks like this once they get
at the shower like it's always in the
garage Ness and I was like ripped
through it with a brush that's fun and I
done when you sign up for SoulCycle at 7
a.m. what are gonna be staying up till
like midnight watching this but oh well
I guess when do I see this will be after
so how do you feel about it how it goes
down we both think we know who we want
to win but who's gonna win like we think
that Brian's gonna win but we want
petered way
because when it seems too good to be
true ladies and gentlemen is because
it's too good to be true
because we think that he'll just be like
a loser whoa that just like pulled me in
this is literally what we predicted we
were like we want Peter when we think
Brian's gonna win and right not wins
like they're engaged I mean I think it's
right it's like he won like I've always
liked Brian but Peters supposed to be
your husband
Oh I'm upset oh my god it is a scary
commercial I'm scared I'm scared
Oh we were saying at their engagement
felt to like do you guys want to mean
who's with us leave your comments down
below it felt to like they're both so
happy he was like you're right you're
right
you know ya know and like neither than
words like crying or anything like I
remember with Sean and Catherine's
engagement Catherine is like she was
like freaking out like I feel like it
should be like that
yeah I agree we thought the connection
with Peter was deeper and watching Peter
with her was so rough I was a little
bitch cry the whole time like he was
crying and he's like I'm still in love
with her and I'm like oh my gosh how
freaking sad but I mean hopefully her
and Brian are like happy ever after you
know she deserves it and that's another
thing I think cuz she's had so many
boyfriends now I'm like with Nick and
everything like she's just like okay
totally engaged heaters such a cutie
Peter call me we're like a little young
but that's okay I'm ready to get married
like yesterday so literally 20 but I'm
just like me and Taylor like lived
through the bachelor bachelor I mean I
can't wait to get married I think the
show puts out a lot of like unrealistic
expectations not like I feel like like I
know it does it does but anyway yeah I'm
gonna get married at 24 in Tosh's to be
married at 44
oh yeah guys leave your comments down
below of like gossip you've heard and
just like cuz I want to know more
interesting than that and just like what
how do you feel about it because we have
lots of feelings but get so like Brian I
always thought he was cute and he's like
I like how he treats Rachel cuz he's
really nice to her but it seems too good
to be true and we think that it is but I
guess it's not morning time when it's
full cycle right now
just got back from SoulCycle
I'm living up to my basic self looks
like I got a green juice next door on my
way out because I was like might as well
start of the day extra healthy and I
don't think of how this one before it's
just greetings one it only has kale
spinach Germain parsley cucumber lemon
celery so there's like no fruit so it
really just tastes like vegetables which
tastes really healthy I like them
they're like banana and because it look
like sweet so it's not that sweet but
yeah basically it was a really good
experience here I went with he was so
good his music was really good
Camille go to Camille in so mom and I'm
gonna stop talking and get ready cuz we
had sleep in like half an hour so ready
became with all of our packages we love
you Peter oh my gosh she's so cute he
comes in every day with like handful as
a package is a fetish and I'm kind
soutache tire just in the back room
right now and doing some work and we
just caught lunch they literally get
catered lunch every day it's like so he
looks in I'd like you stay in the body
side oh you're right they didn't I feel
like the week oh there's popcorn why
