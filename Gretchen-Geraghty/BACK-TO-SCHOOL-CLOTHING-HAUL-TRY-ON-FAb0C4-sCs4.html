really exciting video very guys I've
been waiting so long to just make sure I
had everything that I wanted to show you
we're back to school I know a lot of you
are actually already back to school but
I personally am NOT I go to Boston
University and I don't move in until a
week from today I move in on September
3rd I still haven't done like a back to
school haul video yet because like I
said I've just been getting it literally
if so much stuff online I've been
ordering like crazy but I've been
waiting for it to Olga day and so I can
like show you all at once you know sorry
if you can see my massive stack of boxes
that are like to follow me just have a
bunch of clothes and shoes that I got
for the back-to-school season ok so the
first thing I'm going to be showing you
is this massive sack a box so if you
guys don't know I seriously have a shoe
obsession I know in all videos before I
showed a bunch of shoes that I got and
this is going to be no exception because
I'm just obsessed with getting these
shoes I don't know why I just love shoes
hit the first Paragon or just these nude
heels from Steve Madden and they're
called this DC sandals in there and the
color blush patent leather I believe so
they look just like this and they're
these beautiful eye heels and are just
nude patent leather there's a good thin
strap right there and it goes on your
ankle right there really love these then
the next pair also Steve Madden I just
love Steve Madden and these are a little
bit more like wearable like these I'll
actually be able to wear to class and
stuff either just these black sandals
that look just like this they go across
your toe right there and on the ankle
and I love the zipper like these are so
cute and I actually saw a girl wearing
these I think at the mall and she had
maxi dress on in these shoes and I was
like where those from and I found
everyone Steve Madden going to be
perfect especially for the beginning of
the school year cuz it stays so hot
through September in Boston user the
Darci sandals I parted my hair the other
way today and I feel so weird what do
you guys think I feel weird the next
year I got from a Chinese Laundry and
these I'm obsessed with do you guys
watch The Bachelorette like me because
literally I'm obsessed and Jojo I follow
her on Instagram she was wearing these
in an Instagram picture
I think hers were a bit more Brown but I
like these ones because these are this
like taupe color
I believe these are called at the
break-up booty heel things and I love
these because they're just so different
like they're sloppy right there and
there's a good cutout in the toe and I
love heels that are
covered like this right here looking
more like booties because then they're
like easier to walk and you know because
then your butt doesn't like fall forward
I really like these are like the chunky
heel oh I just think so cute and in the
next pair I got from a Chinese Laundry
as well I'm so excited about these these
are just these black little booties
again with like the chunky heel they
look like this these I'm gonna get so
much more out of I just know because
actually little booties like this that
are brown from Steve Madden that I
showed from sushi looking a hall before
oh my gosh should I even say all these
shoes are from zoo shoe by the way and I
know I shown shoes from Zoo before but I
just love getting shoes Mizzou chic is a
like soy different brands like they've
seen Matt in Chinese Laundry Fri like I
just get like so many shoes from there
so yeah science is like these black
booties and they're called the Handy
booties I believe these next boots from
Chinese Laundry are my favorite pair of
shoes that I got because look at them
here's these over the knee like black
suede booties that are flat on the
bottom I have been on the lookout for
really good like over the knee black
boots like this but my problem is I
always come across ones that have healed
and I just didn't want ones with heels
because you guys don't narrow with a 5 9
and I just wanted to get a pair that I
could wear like every day and not like
wear heels to class you know so these
are just going to be perfect already no
matter where I'm with like skirts like
dresses and leggings and they're just
gonna be so cute they're cold
- Riley boots the last pair of boots I
have to show you guys is literally so
exciting I wanted these shoes for so
long I kid you not and I finally got
them they popped the Melissa button back
zip these are these Fri riding boots oh

you how long I've wanted like Frye boots
like look at how beautiful they are just
look at there are these beautiful like
light chestnut brown color they button
in the back right there and like zipper
all up the back and these are just so
cute and I cannot wait to wear these
yeah like I said all those shoes are
from Mizzou and I know I've talked about
is a shoe and haul videos before were
like more about it but basically it just
says what said that I was like all these
different shoes if you don't know about
it and also this video isn't like

the close so I lied I said let's get
down to the close but I forgot I

too obsessed
so these tissues are actually from
forever 21 and I show them in a blog
recently you guys are subscribed to
Lucy's in my vlog Channel definitely go

and make vlogs seriously every day and
yeah good to see more like personal size
of me if you haven't seen my channel
before but yeah so these are just
remember 21 and I've never had choose
from forever 21 and I'm seriously so
impressed these are beautiful I wear
them to dinner the other night and I
just love them like look at them they
have all these cutouts and my friend Kat
actually had them and I thought they
were so cute and I thought they were
like Steve Madden or some acrylic time
to burn because they look so expensive
to me but they were like 35 bucks at
forever 21 so I was like yes and these I
feel like I'll wear even more the next
paragraph remember to anyone because
they're just these black little wedge
booties and these are really comfortable
because they're like wedges not like
heels and they cover the front like I
was saying I like shoes like that and
really cute like mmm cute Farrah my hair
keeps bothering me if I'm like touch me
a lot I'm sorry then I got this outfit
from forever 21 and I actually showed it
in like a snapchat I think you don't
follow me on snapchat go follow me is
that crashing with five ends this is
literally just like a self promo video
I'm like go follow me but no like a lot
of you guys were saying like oh my gosh
like where is that from a lot of you I
saw in um oh and a vlog is where I show
this a lot of you were saying like oh is
she and zarab know it's her Urban
Outfitters and I got this skirt that
I've been wanting for so long now like
literally I feel like a lot of this
stuff is stuff that I've had my eye on
for like so long and I finally just got
it it's just this little like taupe
suede miniskirt I have no skirts like
this but I just saw it and I'm like you
know crouch and try to like branch out
try it on and I was like in love when I
tried it on like it's just so soft
does he just looks so good on to it's
like really cute it's not too short but
it's not like too long and then to go
with it I got this cream sweater and
seriously I just think it looks so good
together and then I was like any of
those boots or heels and I just showed
you like it would be such a cute outfit
so I just got this creme at cable knit
sweater and this is like so beautiful
and I feel like my whole life I've just
been looking for a beautiful cream cable
knit sweater like this
I finally found the one of my dreams and
also this is look so great like this was
actually made for me because their
disease elbow pads in the back it's like
the same color is the cream truly I've
always thought I would pad look really
cool but I can never look commit to
getting a sweater with one because I
didn't know if I was like it so this is
like perfect that it's like the same
color because it's like not as
noticeable so basically I just love it I
look so good like tucked in the skirt
and this is gonna be my legs go to fall
outfit I already know then I got two
shirts from American Apparel I just got
this blue a t-shirt crop top which
seriously this is like my favorite color
ever it's just so comfortable so I know
I'm gonna get lunch inside of that and
then this I tweeted a picture of them
like guys do I get it do I not get it
and basically it just looks like this
black body con like long-sleeve shirt
however it's the one from American
Apparel that has like the little choker
in the back is you can see like when I'm
wearing it on and I always like iffy
about it cuz I'd like no choker necklace
is I don't have any choker tops like
this but I decided should branch out and
then I just got these pajamas from
Ettore secret which I also showed in a
blog recently and they're just these
light pink and dark pink like striped
cotton PJ's or I just love them keeps
you running I got it in size small long
since I'm five nine and PJ pants are
always too short of me so these are like
perfect length so if you're like five
nine or above I would suggest getting
the long ones and I have no matching PJ
sets so I like decided you know I should
get one I should just splurge on a good
pair and also like what came with it
like look and everything I just showed
you from forever 21 Urban Outfitters
American Apparel and Victoria's Secret I
actually all got through this app called
don't app and I've talked about it
seriously and like all of my haul videos
before so if you don't know what it is
like you're living under a rock no I'm
just kidding but basically that's like
the only place I get my clothes like
online now because it has seriously
every store like it has like urban
outfitters a sauce Victoria's Secret
Zara like everything and for me it's
just so convenient to like get it all in
one place because I don't want to like
search online and all these different
places and like place all these
different orders and I can just get it
all at once on do't so it's like key I
feel like I have to say this in every
video which is annoying but it's not
this video is not sponsored by dope but
if you guys do want $5 off and free
shipping off your first order you can
use the code Gretchen because basically
like a free five dollar gift card to
anywhere you want like who doesn't want
that so go ahead you scratch you
you're not signed up already and yeah
you're welcome
moving on the next time I have to show
you I've been waiting to show you
forever - I've had it for almost like
two or three weeks now and this is
there's a bunch of stuff that I got at
soul cycle when I was in Montauk my
cousin Mandy would like see it on your
boat you know literally I went to
SoulCycle like two or three times when I
was there but I had to just go all out
because I knew I wouldn't go in awhile
and look at how cute this bag is like I
saved it I'm gonna use it but I
literally just went psycho and got like
everything because her stuff is so cute
and you guys know I work out with all
the time so I'll use it don't worry so
the first thing I got and I know you
guys have seen this in videos before I
wore it in my college like Q&amp;amp;A video I
just got this Navy t-shirt that says
Soul Montauk and also I think this is
from the men's section but like I don't
even care because cute I'm gonna wear it
and I like it
whoo then I got this tank top which i
think is so cute I know I wanted like an
Instagram and whatever it's just like
this blue and white and orange paint job
it's kind of looking my little thing W
goes up high in the front and it says
soul and I just really like it so good
when you're biking you're spinning it
just has a little lilo logo on the back
so this is super cute and I just got
this gray tank top which is a little bit
more tight-fitting it just says so
SoulCycle SoulCycle in case you couldn't
read and I just had to tell you four
times but I just think this is really
cute I've already worn it to work out
and this is definitely my favorite of
everything I got from so single but it's
actually from the men's section as well
it just is a grey hoodie on the arm it
just says Seoul Hampton and on the back
it says MGK for Montauk which i think is
funny because pretty much every other
store rebates Montauk is mtk but
SoulCycle does Emma and TK so anyway if
you guys go to Montauk you know what I'm
talking about and I actually just
watched it for the first time and look
what happened this string fell out of
the hoodie part like right there so I'm
gonna have to try to fix that okay and
then these cropped leggings I actually
bought yesterday from Lululemon and I've
had my eye on these for so long I almost
ordered them off the dope and then I was
like no Gretchen you don't need it and
then yesterday is at the mall and I was
like I can't I can't resist so these are
just called the pace rival crop and also
a part of me feels like they might be
getting rid of these and getting new
ones because these were sharing a little
cubby you know with box how the lumen
stores are set up with like with the
looking section or sharing a little box
with it was called the paste rival crop
Mara
on and there look different than these
so I hope they're not getting rid of
these but I was like okay I gotta get em
in case they are and they're just these
black across Lululemon leggings and no
one can get mad at me and say like you
have too many Lula muggings because
these are cropped and I don't have any
cropped ones so yeah and I love it's a
bath like on the bottom how it's a mess
right there and like the little design
so these are really cute and I know I'm
gonna wear my bunch and what I like
about these is you can like dress them
up and dress them down I'll let you in
on a little secret from SoulCycle I also
initially bought these I think they're
called the inspire crops or something
these black cut leggings since I've been
wanting that cropped leggings but they
said like stole cycle down the side I
think and they have like a little skull
make up wheel logo and I really like
them but I knew that I wouldn't be able
to wear them other than like working out
those cropped ones I truly feel like I
weigh like with a spider and like
sandals and I can dress them up the ones
that I stole take a look like a little
skull on them like I feel like I can't
wear like a sweater in sandals with them
like it'll look funny so actually return
this always like the one I got those
ones and I'm happy I got those is it
like then the next things I have to show
you are a little funny I'm like a little
weird and you guys don't feel like well
it felt like okay I'm just gonna show
you these bras I got and basically
they're all these strapless like sticky
bras which I'm so excited about because
a lot of times I wear like deep cut
stuff in the front and like open bag
stuff and I always run the sticky
strapless Pro from like I don't even
know where I got these ones from nude
where I'm really excited to try these
how and the first one I got they would
look like chicken cutlets like this is
so funny
but I just got this a new lace one and I
think I'll wear this one the most times
it's like nude and like you won't be
able to see it and the inside is just
literally like this sticky part and
what's nice about these is that they
come and it's like case and the next
track was sticky bra good it looks like
this and this I just thought was really
cute like I'll just have to wear
undershirts better like black and like
low-cut you know because through it when
I fig it might go through but like same
type of dealio just like stick on and
these I've never had a pair of like
petals like these before but I think
these will come in so handy with like
really Angie chomps you know and
basically these if you haven't heard of
them are just like these at tiny little
nude petals that are just a lot smaller
for like even more like revealing stuff
that like these would be too big you
know what I'm saying like these are a
lot smaller than these so I'm really
excited to try these out and I guess
I'll keep you updated in my vlogs or
something
about them because I wear sticky bras a
lot and I've been meaning to get new
ones so I just got all of these ones
from nude wear and also like here my
package guys like ooh look how funny
this is I'm literally gonna wear this to
like sleep like every night well look at
this tank top it's like this peachy pink
tank top and it says hashtag bringing a
sexy bag I just think that is so funny I
actually love the back like lookit it's
just all open and it has like a big
heart and who remembers with me guys
like literally if you remember this I
will love you you're like a one who
like when I'm brandy melville when it
first opened like probably three or four
years ago I don't even know it opened
like so long ago when they first started
their store they had all these ping cups
that like heart cutouts in the back does
anyone remember with me like if you
remember let me know but at the top it
just says new bears so yeah that's fun
these next two things also again I've
been waiting so long to show you because
you probably even seen them I think I
wore this like an opposite week before
and I got these when I went to New York
City in a vlog like a couple weeks ago
but I just got this sports bra FINRA
Tori secret and it just gray and has a
black detailing and I love that it says
like vsx in the back and I've never had
any like Victoria Secret sport wear
before so definitely wanted like try it
out and Lucy was telling me that they
have this promotion going on where I'll
give you by sports probably get like
three leggings so I was like oh my gosh
look of course so these were like such a
good deal because normally they're kind
of expensive but yeah I just got this
and in case you're wondering like in
cases matters
I got a 32 PS oh yeah by the way I'm not
to be in like a double a but I don't
know why 32p just fits me but I'm
literally not to be and then I just got
these at black leggings but again I've
never had like anything from the
Victoria Secret sportswear but I love
what trying out any lugging is because
my favorite probably or like just little
lemon ones but I definitely wanted to
try these ones out and they're just all
black and then they say like via sex
right there on the back and yeah and
also I noticed these run big cuz usually
I'm small but these I got an extra small
so just keep in mind Oh before I forget
guys I've been using these for the past
like month and I've been we need to talk
about them in a video so I'll just talk
about them now because you guys don't
like know about them I don't think like
I haven't talked to Adam in javed yeah
they're just these cos body lotions and
I think these are like new because I
don't really seem around that much but I
love these like these are amazing I've
been using the pink one the most in it
oh my gosh it seriously just smells so
good like I just love it and this isn't
believer berry blossom and this is in
the flavor delicate petals so I have
been loving these definitely recommend
all right I know this how video is
getting along but I just have a couple
more things to show you I promise when I
was in Montauk with me indeed on the way
back home we actually stopped in Long
Island so if you guys are from Long
Island probably know this boutique it's
called Vanilla Sky and a lot of times
you guys asked for Manny's closer from
and she gets like so many rompers and
dresses and stuff from Vanilla Sky cuz
it's just this really cute boutique in
Syosset case you're wondering so I knew
I had to stop in cuz Mandy actually had
both of these in like different colors
she had this rumpert and navy and
cheered this one in red but I got this
little round part in red and I've worn
nice and logs before it seriously my new
favorite romper like I love it this is
just so flattering I feel con anyone
probably gonna be able to find links to
because I think it's just a boutique
like in store I'll see if they have an
online website but I don't think they do
and in case you're wondering everything
in this haul that I can find the links
for and that's like not sold out online
or whatever I will have a link down
below so you can check it out because I
feel like I say this in every video but
definitely check out the description box
because it takes me a while it's like
link everything then I forgot this black
peplum rubber which is a little bit more
formal is like that this is so beautiful
it just looks so good on these well from
the website called it one piece and I'm
gonna be talking out one piece more and
like an upcoming video but I just got
these black joggers which again I want
to vlog the day these are just these
black joggers and I love these they'll
just like ones from like Lululemon and
they're like really good material and I
feel like I'll probably wear them on
like moving day I'm moving in a week
because like moving day I just want to
be really comfy so these are just so you
might say you can dress them up and then
I got this scarf which is so so nice
like it's like the best infinity scarf
ever because it's really big zips up so
you can even wear it like a different
way if you just like wrap it up all
around your neck like that okay then the
last thing from one piece I have to show
you you've all been waiting for it this
is like what they sell I got a one piece
like a onesie oh my goodness I am so
excited to wear this FB you just like
chilling in my suite this is gonna be so
great it just is gray literal onesie
with like this white like snowflake
print on it and it's so cozy it comes
with like a little
we can so now I've tea like this one in
the Victoria's Secret once okay I
thought I was done but I actually just
saw I got a couple more things to show
you and again these aren't even close
but I just wanted to show you and this
will like help explain like what's on my
face because I know wearing like more
makeup and I normally do normally like
don't wear makeup in the summer like
everyday but I got these at Sephora
recently and I never like showed it in a
video I don't think but this is just
what I've been loving and wearing when I
do wear makeup so I finally got the
Laura Mercier translucent setting powder
and like everyone and their mother has
this and I could talk to it on YouTube
so I just wanted it and I really have
been lighting this I under my eyes
because I like doing like a really light
under-eye and it's just really good for
setting makeup on my face and then you
guys always complaining about how bad my
eyebrows are but okay is eyebrow game
better today guys what do you think
because my friend Hannah oh is it told
me to get the honest Agia beverly hills
dipbrow pomade and finally I got it and
really I love it like this is what I'm
wearing my eyebrows today and I've never
like done my eyebrows before I can like
barely remember to pluck them like once
a month so I'm really not good at them
and everyone says how terrible they are
but I seriously don't do anything to
them so now I've been using this and
hopefully they look better and you guys
approve and I'm just in the color soft
brown and keeps your wondering because I
do get blonde highlights well obviously
you can tell my hair's like brown is it
up so my eyebrows are like pretty medium
dark brown normally so that's why I'm
not like taupe or like the blond one I'm
the soft brown shade and I really do
recommend this cuz I'm using it a bunch
and then I just got the Urban Decay
Naked glide on pencil oh we have the
shades naked and it just is beautiful
like pinky nude color and that's what
I'm wearing my lips right now that's
what I've been loving I've been really
getting into lip liners recently I've
been getting into like makeup again
because I really like doing makeup yeah
I really like this lip liner it looks so
good and all that is from Sephora and
this is me from Sephora but I've just
been wearing it as you can tell like a
little bit of gloss on top of that
because I like like a glossy lip this is
just the Chanel lip gloss and 1:31 gloss
the mir yes just this really pretty
pinky shiny go outside I like to on top
so yeah you I guess that was everything
thank you guys were like sitting through
this have you made it to the end
comment down below what you're most
excited for for fall if you made it to
the end because I'll be so proud of you
honestly I think I'm most excited for
apple picking and
apple-cider I love a colossal cider and
warm apple cider - we just generally
apple cider so yeah thank you guys so
much for watching and I'll see you my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
