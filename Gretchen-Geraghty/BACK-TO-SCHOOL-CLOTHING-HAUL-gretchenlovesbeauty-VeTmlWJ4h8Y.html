haul video for you guys and I have a
bunch of items from doe which you guys
know I'm looking intern for doe so I've
been loving dough and just buying so
much stuff on there I have some stuff
from Nantucket that I forgot to show you
from a while ago so it's just kind of a
bunch of different stores oh they may
comment down below if you like when I do
collecting holes from like a bunch of
different stores or if you like what I
just use one specific store but first
off we have some stuff from Urban
Outfitters you guys know I'm like crazy
obsessive your parameters so I've been
getting so much on Jo and this first
thing is this navy blue dress that's
just short sleeve it's like a t-shirt
dress and you guys know I have gray and
I wear it all the time so I just knew
that I wanted it in blue and then I just
got these PJ pants which I'm so excited
about and I literally just copied my
friend Keaton here on YouTube and I
thought she had a really cute Instagram
photo and these pants and the matching
tank top and so I just ordered the
matching tanks up to you so that's like
on its way from Jo oh wait I need to
talk about the beat up Dan so if you
guys don't know dough is just like this
at Latasha oh my best friend and here's
the Josh I need you we are interning for
Jo this summer and we're actually going
to do like in San Francisco August 6th
through the end of that week and we're
gonna have a meet-up for you guys so
that's so exciting and I knew I wanted
to mention meetup in this video in the
beginning so hopefully I didn't talk too
much or for it I always have all the
details to list it down below and
especially in that eventbrite that I
made because I'm just making like all
the details in there and I don't wanna
forget anything so definitely just look
at that but it's August 6th 5 p.m. at
the Jo headquarters and we're looking to
have between like 5060 people come and
if you're like in San Francisco or want
to come meet Tasha and I or like asked
us questions just about social media
like being youtubers being in transit or
whatever we'd love to chat with you guys
so I'm like so excited for that and he's
so fun oh yeah and also if you haven't
downloaded joke before definitely if do
that and you can use the code Gretchen
for five dollars off and we should
of any stores at the five elegant carts
to do that all right guys I'm just
cutting in here really quick to give you
an update on the meet up after only
posting on Instagram and then our all 60
tickets were taken so that was such a
surprise because I honestly thought like
ten people that watch my videos lived in
San Francisco already comes but I
obviously want everyone that could be
able to go to meet us you know I mean
the details have changed and now we're
actually meeting at 3:30 p.m. August 6
in San Francisco at Dolores Park and
it's really close to dos and some of you
obviously could not get tickets and we
just physically can't fit more than 100
people in those offices we're just going
to have like a meet and greet photoshoot
at 3:30 p.m. at Dolores Park where
anyone can come obviously even if you
don't have a ticket to go to Joe's
offices after this is just like the best
solution we could think of to try to
meet as many people as possible but also
we knew we wanted to have kind of like a
structured more like panel thing where
we could answer you guys questions about
internships about being in social media
everything like that and I'm sorry I
feel like I'm being confusing right now
so basically it's gonna be the park 3:30
to 4:30 and then if you have a ticket
you are welcome to come to do at 5:00
right after but if you don't have a
ticket then you can just come to the
park and that's really fine we can just
talk to me that and if for some reason
the Eventbrite is still open maybe some
people cancel their ticket orders I'll
put the link down below so you can check
it out but it'll probably say that all
the tickets are gone definitely if
you're able to come meet us
San Francisco August 6 3:30 p.m. Dolores
Park um because I just can't wait to
meet you guys mutti Yards is like when
my favorite things ever can't wait to
see you on Sunday and then this body
suit has already under fun time was this
bodies do I just got from Urban
Outfitters it's just black and like ribs
and then the reason I loved
I think that was because the back is all
I caved like that so so cute oh my gosh
I'm I forgot to show my new favorite
pink to top from Urban Outfitters as
well I love it gotta undo super cute
these shorts also from toe obviously
they're just black they like stain shut
away so I can collect paper bag actually
then they tie in a bow they're really
cute and I already have them in green if
you guys saw those green shorts I showed
it in my left sort of animal video so I
knew I just wanted them and black this
dress I actually got from my token this
for job well got from Urban Outfitters
and it's just yellow and it's a short
sleeved dress and it's like darker yell
at the top and it gets like a lighter
yellow at the bottom so I love this
obviously for today and then I've been
really into yellow so I just picked up
this crop top it's like a little t-shirt
also from dope but not prefer Urban
Outfitters anymore I got this little
jumpsuit 2-piece set things I tried this
on in red and three people and then
they're sold out of the red hot dog yeah
so then I just got it in teal but I'm
happy I got seal because I became mean
so much on the right some so it's just
like this Tito strapless crop top and I
think this would be really cute to wear
and it's um to just look like denim
high-waisted shorts or any other
high-waisted shorts and in the pants I
love they're like so flowy I feel like
these might be running a little bit big
because I got a small if anything you
might be a little big on me I don't know
if they have that just know just keep
that in mind because don't worry I'm
like between like small or medium so
yeah these were on kind of thing and
also on 5 9 and that's pretty tall and I
like have to wear heels with these or
else you like drag on the ground so I
feel like they're made for someone
that's like 511 to also be careful about
if you like fun you
I've been going like crazy yet so our
recently dies like I didn't go there for
so long like I just have never done
anything when I would shop there but
then I realized actually so cool so some
of this is your dope but most of it is
when I went to Sierra Mexico last time
and I wanted to get some good like
internship clothes so I want to help
guys out that look internship sorry
you're gonna have one do you want to
know what to wear the first dance I got
like really obsessed with and a lot of
people said on Instagram they like them
bigger is charity recruitment that's oh
my god so that yeah also if you guys are
in college or sorority recruitment like
business casual is definitely how you
want to dress because you're just gonna
look like really professional and put
together so I feel like Zara has just
been like killing the game because I've
been getting such good stuff there and
this is just like the herringbone no
gang up Kingdom gang up nigga I didn't
like give me that first one back but now
I love it cuz like everything I've been
getting in Spain I really like these
little trousers because roughly down the
side and a lot of people were asking me
for the link for these but I actually
think you're still about house and runs
every about that but maybe they'll get
them back and stuff and I was just
obsessed with these I feel like they're
so fun or you can hear like the city
like that would have been fun it'll make
for some cool background noise all this
is totally out of my comfort zone guys
cuz I always wear like the t-shirt
dresses like this like everyday then I
just saw obviously bunch of business
casual stuff that should be getting so
it's like kind of different in my style
but it's good to like grow up and be
mature so this is also gingham and it
just kind of has like a button at the
top of the neck and I really like this
because it like flares out with this
leaves I think it's such a cute detail
and also another cute detail is that
Oh in the back then I grabbed these
boyfriend jeans I think that's what
they're supposed to be and I don't
really understand the sizing there
because it's like 34 36 38 like that you
know so I don't really know so I
literally just pick up ones that I think
would look like will fit me and get
those and either just like a light wash
boyfriend jeans did it button up like
that they're really fun either cover
like raw and like cuddle on my feeling
definitely the style nowadays and this
top has been a fave I wouldn't wait more
than I thought I would Oh like I said
I've been reeling together obviously so
I got this yellow crop top it's like
always super cute and then just ties it
in a bow in the back and this I actually
got away with like wearing my internship
one day you just have to wear like
really high waisted stuff so that your
stomach doesn't shove it all
but I also want it more casually with
like just like white high-waisted jeans
and my stomach shows a little bit then
these pants is actually really funny I
got like really high waisted trousers
and then this day we got like one inch
Peter and I work and I just feel like
Indian food all over the print and I
don't even see the stains anymore come
on if it's just like but there is like
orange stains all over the front of
these pants and actually better now and
they're just like little trousers they
did me perfect and these are obviously
perfect for like business iya situation
and then these are actually a bit worn
yet they still have like the tag on them
on these are big also because these are
small but I think these white ones that
I got a medium but these black ones to
get and look at almost eBay and these
pants are really interesting these are
remind me of these
charts from Urban Outfitters but these
are some answers are and they kind of
like bunch of the top and like tie again
close will be good for when I go back
I'm gonna bring like all these when I go
back to me this go to look like get
together again and then this quite
honestly sure I really went ham as
alright like I just gotta be like it's
like really puffy on the city's long
sleeve and just like cropped a little
bit and then I got this little sweet
laser thing which I thought was just
like fashion comfy I went to Lululemon
the other day and I picked up these
speed tights because I actually lost my
blog speed tights that I haven't so
that's really sad but then I was like I
need a new pair and these were actually
like on sale which is cool so I don't
know if they're like discontinuing this
BJP's or whatever but they were always
like my favorite leggings to run in
because it pockets on the side so that's
like super important for me and then
these are randomly size 2 which is so
weird cuz normally I'm a floor and
they're like snug but these don't fit me
oh okay
I don't know if the lemons like sizing
is changing and last but not least my
things from and in Tucket is painfully
stuffed that's like off the shoulders
everyone's like where's it from
I feel them exactly it's really unique
you don't see this link around
everywhere
sorry they're sirens I just got it from
so boutique it in tuck it and it's like
a PC verse where they're she loves it
now she's obsessed with like all their
stuff so I like one camp and this can I
tell you the brand's maybe that will
help
it's by lovers and friends besides I
thought it was cropped but it's not you
can wear it with like mini waisted jeans
and then these pans I feel like you're
so fun I don't think it's those fun
instagramming these yet but I've been
bearing them so much because they're so
unique and they're just like open on the
sides and I've been wanting like glowy
nice summer pans like this and Abby
actually had them these direct ones I
just like totally copied her and got
them these are in the brand Tori Craver
swimwear I got this floral tank top
which I didn't know if I wanted but then
I'm like I'll regret if I don't get it
so I got it and it's all a pleated in
the front and it's like red light blue
so I thought that was the summary and
fun and this is from then I found the
best shirt which I think I just would
have been forgetting to show minimal
videos but I got this on go as well just
this white Kate Spade short slam t-shirt
and it's like so nice and if you guys
felt like a vlog I think I showed it in
I got Taylor Meadows friend this year
because she has wanted it for like so
long ever since I like spending her
pictures we trying it on so I got it for
her but then I was jealous that I didn't
have one of my own
and actually when I say also I think
it's someone's yeah I think I just don't
so quickly because you guys are here
that was like quick yeah for your
biggest fan go for it
