college dorm hoppitty for you guys and
I've been it so something to film this
video because I remember I filmed on
last year I literally can't believe
somewhere is like coming to an end like
FB you we don't move in till really late
I don't know if into like September
second or third I think but yeah so the
first thing I have to show you guys is
actually behind me right now I don't
know if you can tell this little puppy
is a headboard you see me okay I'm gonna
put in some other shots of this you can
see it better and basically it's just
this white lace headboard that I'm
seriously obsessed with if you're in
college you know you have like between
XL beds and having it to embed first of
all sucks and second of all like I
didn't have a headboard so every single
night my pills would fall off and I
would get so annoyed so I found this
which is actually called au bord I'll
have their website linked down below and
I'm just in love with this white lace
one I think it's so pretty and it's
gonna go with like so much and I'm going
for a more like white theme this fall
and it's just gonna fit in like any twin
size bed so it's so great you literally
just slip it in between like the
mattress and the frame of the bed I'm
pretty sure and since I'm in college and
I know a lot of you are too I actually
reached out to you board and they said
they would give you guys 10% off if you
use the code Gretchen this is so nice
I'm gonna be able to lean against it
like three books and it's just gonna be
great and then the next term stuff I
have to show you is rose from a society6
and the reason I love society6 is
because you can get so many different
printed things in so many different like
items does that make sense
you can get comforters tapestries
pictures towels rugs phone cases laptop
cases like literally so much stuff and I
just love it because some things you can
get matching like what I did
so yeah I'll just show you what I got so
I got these three pictures and I'm so
excited I was thinking for like the
theme of my room out go for more like
what kind of like fluffy and like girly
and like white photos that kind of like
a gallery wall and my head it looks good
and I hope it actually looks good when I
put it together and I'm gonna have a
like I'm moving in vlog again cuz I know
I did that last year like you guys loved
it the first one I got I'm so excited I
actually found it rolling through
Pinterest and I saw this and I was like
I need it and of course they had on
society6 because I have like everything
and it just says wake up and makeup and
this looks so cute and I'm probably
gonna put it like near where I do my
makeup and stuff and just a white one
with like a black frame and to go with
my little FEMA
have this cute gold pineapple with again
the black frame it's awesome I'm so
excited for probably a lot of you know
what it's from do you know do you know
it's from Gossip Girl and if you have to
pass a girl you are probably obsessed
with this just like me and I got this
like bigger so it's like the same size
that like Serena had wow I'm a loser but
I just love it to go with like the white
and black like simple theme I just
bought this clock it just has like three
Chanel perfumes and seriously this is so
cute and it's gonna look so good in my
room I can't wait and then I got two
tapestries cuz I couldn't decide which
one I wanted between the two and I'm
still kind of like deciding in which
everyone I don't want I'll probably just
put like in our common room since I'm
gonna speak with seven other people I
know this is gonna be like way too hard
to hold up the show right now but this
is just the New York City tapestry I'll
insert a picture of it right here and
seriously it's just so cute and if you
guys know I'm totally a city girl
so not sure if I want that one or if I
want this one and this is just I'm
pretty sure it's called like an ikat
print again it's kind of hard to show
you but it's just like golden white like
I said I'm going for like a simple like
black boy and I think gold so I think
that would look really good and also
like I said like you can get a bunch of
stuff from society6 that like matches
other things that you have you know what
I'm saying so I also got a phone case
but I don't have it with me right now I
think it's upstairs I like don't even
know where I put it
but yeah it's like the same print is
that gold in my tapestry and I've been
wearing at my phone a lot recently until
I just literally just changed it today
and I'm this phone case which is just
this white in gray marble case and it
has gold on the bottom and I forget I
saw someone with it and I want it so bad
and I found it on society6 and I just
think it's so cool how it's like color
blocked like that and then next from
society6 I just got this white and gray
marble pillow and this is it so cute you
guys know like I love marble like
obviously I'm getting sick very neutral
so like this I think I have three more
things to show you from society6 and the
first thing I'm not very close to the
camera right now if you can't tell so
it's kind of hard to show you but again
I'll insert a picture of this this is
just a white and gray blanket it's like
true printed and I know that Lucy's
gonna love it so I might even let her
have it because this is like totally her
and she was something that she loved it
and then the last two things I'm so
excited to show you like literally so
excited because those of you at know me
best know that I love elephants so I
just got this elephant blanket first of
all can we just it is so
so basically it's just this elephant
print and it's so cute and I'm so
excited
time it my daughter looks so good on my
bed I haven't really decided my bedding
yet I don't know if I'm on you the same
weight roughly bedding is last year or
this other like duvet cover which I'll
show you in a minute so the last thing I
got from society6 is so cute this is
probably one of my favorites of all time
it is this blue beach towel with this
elephant print this elephant is trimming
some gum and he's blowing a bubble like
how he was is also it's so soft too like
literally he could like use a blanket
but okay look it's a towel and I just
know I'm gonna bring this to college and
it's gonna be so cute and if you guys
are interested I will have everything I
just showed from society6 listed down
below and if you use the code Gretchen
deal you will get 10% off of their whole
website and free shipping so yeah if I
just have a couple more places I got one
thing from Walmart I've been looking for
a G initial pillow like this for a while
and I just found this plain one if I can
find a link to this I will link it down
below but yeah I just like him simple it
is and it's look really cute on my bed
and then I just got one little tray from
NK which I will link down below as well
and I've just gotten like little like
accessory type things from there before
so this is just this like wooden tray
but it's like gold print on the outside
keeping with my gold theme and just
mirror on the bottom which I really like
and I'll probably put my like perfume on
this this year because I had a different
like mirror one last year but this one's
just really cute way I'm literally so
dama I got it as a tray but I just
noticed that it's like a hanging up in
the back so I think you're supposed to
hang it like this but that would be
really cute on your wall too if you like
hung it up like that
so maybe you can have two honestly I'll
probably use it like this though cuz I
like it like this and then I just got a
bunch of stuff from dorm I PI and I
showed this in a vlog I believe I showed
me like opening everything but I
generally like talked about it and stuff
and it's all obviously for my dorm room
so I'm gonna show it again in here and I
will have all of it linked down below as
you guys can check it out if you're
interested
also I showed it in my dorm idea video
where I just like staged all of it and
set it all up nice it was in Lucy's room
if you guys know because she has like a
twin bed so I thought that was like work
better the first thing I got is just
this pillow which says namaste in bed
and this is so cute and I've actually
wanted it for awhile because you guys
know I like yoga
I just think that's really cute then I
got this fluffy it gray Mongolian fur
pillow I am like pillow obsessed so I
had to get this cream knit material
pillow with some silver sequins then I
just got this duvet cover it's just this
really pretty pink and white like band
Anna print and on the other side it
looks like this this is just really cute
and cozy too and I don't know if I want
to use this really plain white fluffy
bedding like what do you guys think
and then from Dharma 5 I just got this
white like Mongolian fluffy rug do you
guys see like a theme emerging like I
tried to make it all kind of go together
I really like don't know what I'm doing
but like in my head I feel like it would
look good I actually copied my friend
Taylor when I got this because she had
one just like you're a freshman year
and I was obsessed if you guys saw when
I do like Bob Moses here on my channel
