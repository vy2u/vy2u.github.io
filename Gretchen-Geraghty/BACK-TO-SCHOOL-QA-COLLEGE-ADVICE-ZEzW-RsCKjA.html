video and this video is just about all
of your back to school questions and
specifically wants to do with college
and like the stresses of college and
everything like that so as you can tell
right now I'm actually at my lake house
I'm filming down on the dock live it was
a pretty spot it's quiet it's nice out
so I tweeted out the other day asking
you guys for some of your questions to
do with back to school so we're just
gonna start reading off a Twitter if you
don't follow me you definitely should
it's at GLB uit
i tweet all the time so the first
question is is college as scary as it
seems and no it's not I think what a lot
of people worry about is like making new
friends and I think the best tip for the
eyes to just recognize that everyone's
in the same spot as you and everyone
wants to make new friends if the first
day you move in and like the first week
of classes leave the door open of your
dorm room and you will make your best
friends on your floor they'll be like
you little family and that was from
Katie and Sydney says what are your
essentials to pack so let me think about
that hmmm I would say first essential is
make sure you have cute and comfortable
like room decor and like bedding cute
decor because then you're gonna want to
spend time in your dorm room and like
study and like actually get worked on
I'm like comfortable for your beds that
you're comfortable away from home and I
know especially like the first month of
college can be difficult away from home
so you definitely want like a comfy and
like cute bed so that you feel like at
home and you know what I mean like
relaxed especially in high school too I
remember being so excited to go back to
school but also dreading it because it's
like a big change and I was so excited
to like meet all my friends also worried
about like what cost us to take in like
boys and drama you know what I mean and
literally just going back to school like
with all the stress I remember moving in
my freshman year at that first week I
broke out so much and I was like what
the heck but it's cuz you're just so
stressed you know it's like a big change
going back to school and especially like
moving in freshman year of college and
you definitely don't want to have to
worry about breakouts when you're going
back to school which is why Neutrogena
is my go-to I've been using it for
awhile now and especially these couple
products that I picked up show you guys
and if you guys didn't know there's
actually this quiz from Neutrogena it's
called solve my acne calm and you're
just put in like your skin type like
everything like that and it will tell
you like exactly what products you
should be using which is so nice because
for me I feel like I sort of just go off
of what other people say like what I
should get and what my friends like but
really like everyone's skin is different
so you should be getting products that
are specifically for your skin you know
what I mean
so when I took the quiz I was matched
with just these products and I have the
oil-free cleansing
pipes in the pink grapefruit one there
the acne-prone skin one because my skin
is definitely acne prone remember
freshman year of high school
specifically my skin was like so bad
sorry if you can hear someone's like
weed-whacking and I also got the
oil-free moisture sensitive skin I got
the Neutrogena rapid clear stubborn acne
daily leave on masks in the Neutrogena
rapid clear stubborn acne cleanser so I
basically just put in that like I have
pretty oily skin naturally I'm prone to
breakouts because I definitely had a lot
of acne in the past my skin isn't too
sensitive in the sense that I can use
pretty strong products on my face since
I have had acne before and like if stuff
is really drying I need that because my
skin gets pretty oily so this is like
definitely tailored to my skin
specifically so you guys should
definitely check out this all of my acne
calm quiz so you can discover your own
at personalized acne regimen and I want
to hear about your guys's quiz results
too maybe we matched with the same stuff
and leaving a comment down below with
your quiz results will actually enter
you for a chance to win for your
Neutrogena products in your little
regimen and just to talk about the
products a little bit more because I
know I didn't even talk about it that
much I just talked about like the quiz
but yeah the quiz like matched me up
with these products so maybe you would
get like the same ones as me and
basically the cleansing wipes I'm really
a fan of and I've actually used the pink
grapefruit scrub before when I need you
know like a good exfoliant and I'm so
lazy with taking off my makeup usually I
just wash my face but I've noticed that
if you take off your makeup and then
wash it your skin gets so much more
cleaner and there's like no leftover
makeup left behind in my opinion these
are definitely a must-have and taking
off your makeup before you cleanse your
face is like key and this cleanser is
just awesome I just really like it and
it works maximum strength so I
definitely need that and the leave on
mask is really good too when I'm just at
home for like a pamper day and I'm just
like chillin at home
I can leave a mask on for a while I
usually will use it like on the weekends
and then this oil-free moisturizer I
have been obsessed with recently and
usually and I use like a thicker cream
on my face but this is perfect for the
day because it took a little bit thinner
so I put it on and then I put on my
makeup because when you have dry skin
and you put on makeup it just looks so
bad so I like to use like a thin day
moisturizer because if I use a too thick
of a moisturizer it'll make my skin get
oily but if I use like a thin one and
then my makeup perfecto
and also I just remember to since I've
been using these for the past like month
and I've really been liking the results
I was actually talking about them in
vlogs to view guys aren't subscribe to
my vlog channel it's just that Gretchen
and Lucy on YouTube but definitely go
check it out and subscribe and you can
see myself actually using them
talking about those products more in
depth so yeah oh I think this is from
the same girl Katie said are you ever
planning on rooming with Lucy's so if
you guys didn't know our freshman year I
think we had a lot of questions about
this too like why don't you guys room
together you're twins so if you didn't
know we both decided to go to Boston
University and I'm so happy that we
decided to go together
she's just my best friend and I would
not admit it without her we decided we
should get different roommates freshman
year because we wanted to branch out and
make new friends and I knew if I
remember that I honestly would probably
just hang out with her and not make any
new friends you know oh my god that's so
loud I'm really sorry that's bothering
you and it ended up being that like Lucy
me our friend Taylor and our roommates
were all like really close like we all
had like a little group of friends so
this coming here for our sophomore year
I actually saw this question in here -
when I was scrolling through someone
asked if I was gonna be rooming with my
freshman roommate maca√© and sadly and
no I'm not and I'm not even rooming with
Lucy but let me explain basically it's
like an eighth person suite so my
roommate Micaiah Lucy's Ramayana and
Lucy and I we're all going to room
together but then like our housing fell
through like it didn't work out we
didn't actually have the spots that we
thought we had so we were kind of
scrambling last minute to see if we
could still get in but basically it
worked out pretty well because Lucy and
I actually have Suites that are right
next door to each other so we're still
gonna be right next door just like we
were freshman year we were like across
the hall from each other freshman year
we both have singles which I'm so
excited about to like have my own space
you know but I'll still have like seven
other girls and I'm like living with and
Taylor's in my suite so that's really
nice and a bunch of girls that I'm
friends with so I'm so excited and
Lucy's a little looking to me next door
and Micaiah actually got in last minute
also into a suite that is the floor
above us so I know we're gonna see her
all the time too so that is really good
so things work out guys you know things
have a way of working themselves out
this question says your biggest regret
or thing you knew from freshman yet so
my biggest regret is probably first
semester taking bio and chem at the same
time and I feel like I've talked about
this in so many videos but honestly it
was terrible I like couldn't have a
social life
I was tired all the time I'd get like
three hours of sleep I was working so
hard and I realized I really wasn't
interested in that well actually in a
way then I guess I don't even regret it
because I feel like a part of me would
have always wanted to stick with bio if
I didn't or would have always wonder
like what if I did take bio and chem
because I was so interested in that all
high school and I feel like God has a
plan for all of us and everything
happens for a reason
so I think I was supposed to actually
take bio and come to realize like this
is really not what I want to do so it's
good that I ended up transferring into
the business school
so while I do regret taking in bio and
chem and I wouldn't have taken them both
for his necessary freshman year and
probably not at all if I knew that I
wouldn't have been interested in it you
know I am glad that it showed me that I
didn't want to do that and that just
kind of narrowed down what I want to do
for my career path because who really
knows what they want to do like ever
like I'm so I'm not really sure what I
want to do like I'm in the business
school now but I'm still not exactly
sure you know so while I do regret it I
also wouldn't change it if that makes
sense
that's confusing sorry this question
says why did you choose Boston
University and I think the biggest
reason for that is just being in Boston
and literally I am just such a city girl
I just love being in the city I just
love having so much to do you can go
wherever you want you can do whatever
you want like you never get bored you
can go shopping you can go sites you can
go to restaurants like it's just so fun
it definitely lived up to my
expectations freshman year because Lucy
and I and her friends would always just
go into Boston and do fun things and
honestly Newbury Street it's like to
close out always go and spend all my
money but it's just so fun and I'm so
happy that I chose to go to be you this
question says what is your major so
right now I think generally it's just a
business administration and I'm not sure
if I'm going it to concentrate and
either finance entrepreneurship
marketing I've been thinking about those
three julia says what is your best study
tip so I definitely learned a lot about
studying freshman year I'm the type of
person that gets distracted it's so
easily if my phone on if I have music on
if I had friends around I just get so
distracted so my best study tip is
honestly to go somewhere really quiet
where you know you're not gonna see
people you know and you're not gonna be
really distracted so for me I would go
to the top of stewy 2 because it's
really quiet like study room up there or
like the library is good and also for me
I have to put my phone away because I'm
with my phone is out I check it every
three seconds and I'm texting someone
back or on Twitter on Instagram like I
get so sidetracked 'add so you gotta
just like put it on your phone even turn
it off if you have to maybe just silence
it put it away in your bag and literally
just get it done like sit down focus in
and get it done
is there Lululemon close to BU and yes
there is is right on Newberry it's
literally a mile away from our campus
and it is just so close it's dangerous
oh this is a good question Jessie says
what do you do for stress relief
honestly this is gonna sound crazy and I
know this doesn't work for a lot of you
if you're not like a youtuber but for me
like I know my friends I do YouTube say
like when they're in a bad mood they
can't film YouTube videos because
they're gonna be angry and like sad and
stuff the whole time but for me like I
just love filming and when I get in
front of the camera I'm just like happy
like
automatically cuz I'm just so excited to
like share with you guys what I have to
say you know like when I'd be stressed
or like not in a good mood I would make
myself film a video and I would just be
so excited even if I wasn't filming a
video if I would just sit down and start
talking to a camera even if I'm not
gonna post it on YouTube like maybe if
you don't even have a YouTube channel
you could literally just set up your
phone or just start vlogging just like
talk to your camera and might make you
in a better mood cuz for me makes me so
happy like right now I'm in a good mood
because I'm talking to you guys Julia
says do you make a lot of your own food
at school or do you eat at the dining
hall so freshman year I would say be
eight at the dining hall and we also
didn't really have like barely any means
of making our own food in our freshman
dorms we just had like a mini fridge oh
my god that's so loud I'm really sorry
we just had a mini fridge and a
microwave but in my single in my suite
this coming year I'm gonna have a mini
fridge in a microwave again and I might
even have like a rice cooker and like a
blender like I'm gonna go all out so I
know I'm gonna probably make more food
in my dorm especially Jen's going vegan
and I'm gonna be making smoothie bowls
all the time and like making rice and
veggies in my rice cooker so I think I'm
gonna eat a lot more in my dorm
Jes says what do you look forward most
into going into your sophomore year and
I don't know if this is bad but I'm
literally most excited for my rooming
situation because I'm in like the nicest
building and with seven other really
great girls and it's just gonna be so
fun like I'm so excited and there's air
conditioning and my freshman dorms there
wasn't air conditioning well I guess
another thing too is I'm so excited to
just be taking four business classes
like they're all business I just realize
I've been talking a lot about each
specific question like this is getting
really long so this is going to be the
last question that I'm going to answer
and Morgan actually asked me moving
outfit ideas and she's like can you just
reply right now I'm moving in tomorrow
so I did and I said definitely something
super comfortable I wore athletic
clothes like a tank top and shorts
because you'll be unpacking all day
which couldn't be more true like
literally don't move in and like a dress
and heels because you're just gonna be
unpacking all day like you're living me
sweating so that is it for my
back-to-school Q&amp;amp;A thank you so much for
watching and I'll see you my next video
