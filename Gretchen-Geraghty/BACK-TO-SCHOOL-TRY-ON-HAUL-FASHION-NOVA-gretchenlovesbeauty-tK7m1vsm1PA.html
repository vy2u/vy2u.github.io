back-to-school clothing haul for you and
I know I've been doing so many of these
but I promise this is my last one
everything I have to show you is from
this online website called fashion Nova
and it's just been one of my favorite
websites recently they've so much cute
stuff on there so I will have it linked
down below and I'll have all the pieces
I have linked down below so you can
check those out so yeah yours been doing
a lot of clothes shopping since I'm
going to Boston University this fall and
I want a bunch of new clothes to have a
good wardrobe when I'm at college I
actually leave in two days can you guys
believe it I know it's crazy and I'm
gonna be trying everything on too
because I know you guys like when I do
that thumbs up this video if you like
Tryon halls but who so the first thing I
have to show you is just this white
shirt and just like a long sleeve like
blouse almost it's really flowy and so
pretty looking I love how it ties in the
front like that and has all the lace
details and then in the back I love the
back of the lace crochet detail and I'm
gonna wear it so much and you guys don't
remember me saying this like other haul
videos I think I'm obsessed with white
tops I like only wear white tops I don't
know what it is I just love the way
white looks on so I love that and then I
actually got a pair of sandals because
it does stay warm in Boston for most of
the month of September and in talked
over a little bit and you still can wear
sandals so I just got these brown
sandals with some gold details right
there I love like the gold bar right
there I think it looks so cute and very
chic looking alright just how simple
these sandals are with just the one thin
leather strap across the top of your
foot so Q I don't wanna wear my bunch
and I got a bunch of pairs of jeans the
first thing I just got more of these
like high-waisted type and they're just
like a medium dark wash with a bunch of
rips down the front and I love the way
these fit and then I got a more kind of
light medium wash pair that just have
two rips across the knees and I've been
wanting jeans like this for a really
long time with just like kinda two slits
in your knees I think they're so cute
and then I got a white pair of jeans
because you can write them before Labor
Day right so I can store these for a
little while and they're just white
jeans with a bunch of rips down the
front and I love how to stress there
they're like super super distressed and
I always love the way that looks I think
it's so cute and my white jeans are
actually very tight on me because
ordered a size 26 I believe I'm usually
at 25 or 26 like it's like your waist
measurement usually that translates like
zero or a 1 but they actually came in
there 24 so my waist is not a 24 and
they are very snug behind me but I'll
make it work you know okay and like I
said it does stay warm for most of
September so I just got these shorts and
I just use high-waisted shorts that are
kind of like acid wash I really really
like the way they look on and I think
they're so cute they fit me perfect like
they go actually high up enough on me
because a lot of times high waisted
things don't go up high enough on me
because I'm so tall and have such a long
torso so those would be really well and
I'm gonna love it the way it looks with
a bunch of crop tops and cropped
sweaters and then I just got this
tie-dye shirt and I seriously think it's
so cute it's so unique it's like a navy
blue with kind of white tie-dye stripes
and I love the way it crosses in the
front like that and it also crosses in
the back and it just has one cut piece
of fabric across the top to kind of hold
the shirt together and I love just how
flowy kind of droopy and drapey this
shirt is I think it's so unique and I
should work the other day after dinner
and I got lots of compliments on it then
I just got these floral printed shorts
that kind of have this layer right here
and I love them because I have the
little kind of little pom-pom ball
things at the bottom I love shorts that
have those I think they're so cute and I
love like the layer right here like I
said and they're just this really cute
floral pattern it'll look really good at
that first bite top I shown you and just
kind of more like basic tops and then I
just got this black body hundra's throw
and I have to dress up in college and it
goes like hi necks right there I think
it's very unique looking because of that
and it kind of has some mesh at the top
too it's a very form-fitting just tight
black dress you always need little black
dresses for events and occasions so this
will come in very handy
and then the last thing I have to show
you is actually this black jumpsuit and
it just has his cage kind of detail
across the front
it has all those like little holes in it
I think it's so cute I love like the
look of that and I've seen kind of
different dresses and robbers that have
it's like cage detail in the front I
think it's so so adorable and it goes
like all the way around the side of the
jumpsuit as well and then since I strum
suet goes all the way down into pants
and the back kind of ties it's like open
I know
this is a jumpsuit and it's very long
but I really don't wear jumpsuits that
much I could kind of feel funny when I
wear them so I'm pretty sure I'm gonna
get this tailored and I'm gonna get the
legs cut off so that it's just a romper
because this would be really cute as a
romper too so this is a jumpsuit right
now I will probably be making into a
romper but I still think it's so
adorable so yeah that is everything that
I got from fashion OVA that is my last
back-to-school clothing haul video can
you believe it I know I've done so many
but yeah thank you so much for watching
and I'll see you my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
