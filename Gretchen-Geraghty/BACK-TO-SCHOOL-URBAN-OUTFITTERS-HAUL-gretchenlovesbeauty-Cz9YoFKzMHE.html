you guys and it's just all from Urban
Outfitters and I'm so excited because if
you guys watch me for a while you know
the Urban Outfitters is by far one of my
favorite stores didn't bring out
definitely my favorite I've just been so
obsessed with it recently like obsessive
literally everything so yeah this whole
haul video is just gonna be dedicated
for Urban Outfitters because green just
has my heart right now so the first
thing I got it's just this red dress and
it is so beautiful and I love some
pictures on Instagram of me in it
one if you don't follow me on instagram
by the way you should definitely follow
me shameless self promo can follow me on
Twitter you can add me on snapchat you
should also subscribe so you know when I
post new videos but anyway I know it was
some pictures on Instagram in this red
dress when I wasn't feeling this girl
with Tasha I've been wanting it for so
long
I saw it actually first on the dough
chopping up you know that I had my
internship with in the summer
I literally just love their office so
much and I just feel so lucky I think
it's like work for them
I know I've said it a million times but
I just love how convenient it is to my
stuff on there so actually some of this
stuff from Urban I got like through
dough this isn't like sponsored by doing
or anything but if you just don't know
dough is like a mobile shopping mall
essentially that has like all of your
favorite stores all Ivy restores on
there so sometimes it's just way easier
for me to like one-click buy something
from Urban Outfitters on tote and like
go all the way to the store so yeah
there's actually got and oh oh and if
you haven't used it before you can use
my code Gretchen and you can get five
dollars off and free shipping on your
first order so it's kind of like a $5
gift card to like any store they've been
wanting to buy something oh and if I
didn't they obviously everything will be
a link down below so you guys can find
it super easy except check out the links
in the description box the next time I
thought I actually got because you guys
know Jojo from The Bachelor well your
she had an Instagram picture in this top
or she had like an Instagram stories and
they're like that and I saw it and I was
it so beautiful I just really have been
loving gingham recently I know it's like
a trend for awhile and at first I was
like oh I don't know how I feel I love
it gingham and basically now I'm
yeah then I got two pairs of shorts how
supposed to make sure these on Instagram
never ones are coming up where those
from Urban Outfitters they're just these
high-waisted kind of medium wash blue
shorts no rips or anything just super
basic in casual I feel I can go with a
lot that they're just roll over on the
bottom I think about the brand B D G yes
B D G and just Urban Outfitters
high-waisted things give me the best out
of it anywhere I really can only get
happy stuff from urban because they're
like actually high waisted enough for me
because I'm so tall I have such a long
torso and weakening so much she's have
those and these probably I've been
getting even more use out of these just
caught my eye when I was shopping and I
was like those are beautiful and I'd
like these shorts because again they're
high-waisted enough on me but they also
we're long enough because I feel guys so
many shorts now they're just really
booty shorts and just not appropriate
and these fit me just perfectly and I
can't believe I forgot to show this
dress in this haul video because I've
actually been living in I seriously wear
like every day if you guys watch my vlog
channel got time you see I'm always
wearing it and I also wearing a photo to
reason so love this white dress I got
and then these are like the biggest
steal I'm just a quick little story I
went to the Urban Outfitters store in
search of the boots I'm about to show
you in black and then these puppies
caught my eye I was like these are so
beautiful but then in the store they
only had a size 7 and I was good okay
that's obviously not gonna work for me
and then I went along and I was looking
at doe to order them from doe because
obviously doe has like all of their
product catalog public all the stores
that are on there so that by the miracle
in this store they weren't on sale but
when I went on joke these puppies were
on sale so normally they were like 100
bucks in there 50% off and I got these
for 50 I was like my lucky day so these
are just so beautiful and totally trying
to branch out and I like absolutely love
them because I just have nothing like
snakeskin rings and I just think they're
so edgy and so cool I just really like
the cut of these boots the cut or like
good style so all this time I just
showed you from urban I bought with my
own money and everything because I just
love urban and then this is the most
exciting part ok so you guys know
obviously how would you ever it
I loved urban floor and then over here
two ago I got an email asked me when I
wanted to work with the Urban Outfitters
and I was like it is a joke are you
kidding me
so the rest of the stuff I'm going to
show you they actually sent me which is
like so unreal and I'm so grateful
because I just love urban so much it's
not like sponsored by them or anything
I'm not gonna paint they just like
gifted me these clothes so obviously I
was so excited and a lot of its back to
school like jeans so I know this could
be so helpful for you guys that are
gonna go back-to-school shopping soon so
the first couple things I got that
aren't change I got two robbers it's
been so cute I'm so happy I picked this
one out because it's a tan and white
vertical stripes like ties around the
neck it's like halter and I got this
romper or maybe it's a good jump -
what's the difference
maybe I think jumpsuits with pants these
are what kind of dance like cropped
pants
I just white with like gray stripe at
little detailing it's strapless and I
love like the pants part of it cuz it's
just like really flowery and beautiful
and like crop and it is supposed to be
that cropped up pretty sure because I
know it's like quite cropped on me Owen
even looks like this leather duck and
wing right now that would be so cute
then look I said I'm trying to branch
out my style a little bit and I know
like the embroidered rose trend is so in
if I saw this Jackie and Urban
Outfitters website a while ago and I was
like I need that I just need it and I'm
pretty sure it's my the brand but yeah
it's blinking oh I see and I love the
plank jacket I saw this black leather
jacket with all these like rose and
brighter a little details and then some
like stud type looking details in the
back and I just thought it was so
freaking beautiful and I'm so happy I
got it it's literally so cute I cannot
wait to style this look it's freaking
awesome okay and then for the jeans
ladies and gentlemen are you ready
white jeans I'm gonna start off with
does I have to take them off in
approximately a whole week
I literally have been wearing them every
day and I literally wanted these for so
long because I needed like white
high-waisted jeans I didn't have a pair
so these are just so perfect they have
so much distressed riff detailing so
they're like all frayed on the bottom
which I know is telling right now and
they're supposed to fake cropped so
that's why they fit that way I mean and
also I'm like at all but I love the way
they fit I mean it look a little bit
about my ankle
oh okay so for size for reference pretty
much all the earlier clothes that I
showed you from Urban Outfitters are
just like sighs mom these shorts I'm
pretty sure I got with the 2627 your
girl used to always be like 25 26 and
everything but now more look at 27
gruesome had OPIC these jeans so my
favorite pair of high-waisted jeans ever
in the whole universe are these black
high-waisted jeans super high-waisted
from Urban Outfitters you're like a
skinny vdg and they're not any of the
type something's gonna show you but they
have like seams here if you know I
wasn't happy now I literally got a pair
in eighth grade I think they were like
26 and then I had them for so long that
I was like Gretchen you should like get
into pair just because like these are
really tight and you've had them for
literally five years so then I got the
same thing air but like a new pair and I
got 27 and then they were almost like
kind of loose on me like they fit me
well but they're like a little loose on
the waist like falling off a little bit
so it's like I don't know if I should be
like 26 27 in these jeans and then I'm
super happy I got 27 and all of them
because they all like fit me pretty well
but then these white jeans I'm so happy
I read the reviews about online because
I said they've brought in really small
so I actually got 28 in these and
they're like a little bit loose but I
think a 27 would've been too small so
I'm happy about 28 in these and just
like for your reference I would say like
to size up on these white did you get
them but then like all there are
something to show you or like 27 and
they're perfect the guy users wear my
clothes way to tell you and like then I
realized that I didn't need to be a
double zero and everything and by like
24 isn't like they just didn't fit me
anyway so these are definitely my next
favorite pair jeans are just like
high-waisted medium wash they have like
someone just stressing and I think all
of these are bdg and then I love at the
bottom of these have like a little cuff
detail that's like I think it's sewn in
oh it's not sewn in just kidding they
just came like cuffed over like that and
I let them like this they're called the
mom high-rise then the next pair of
denim I got is kind of the same watch
it's like a medium wash but this doesn't
have like any just dressing in it and
these are called the girlfriend jeans
they fit a little bit more high-waisted
Houyhnhnm this very says girlfriend
high-rise Jean is well haven't ate the
darker like laughs black what is that
that's like tan like threading you know
oh yes and these are so fun these are
the PDG Jesse mid-rise true straight and
they're 27 is 32 length my one or two
links in all of them are well they're
all like pretty much okay I'm me and I'm
like five nine yeah okay this men so
good but I love with James I kept like
the button right there other than like
this ever clinch think it's like fine
and usually those type of jeans always
there like you need to have like a
little bit more it's bigger dystrophy
and man like the girls a little bit
looser fitting and then the last pair
jeans I got far the twig crop high-rise
jeans they are kind like a dark grey
black rings and they have holes knees
and then I love the bottom of these as
well because it's kind of like bra like
cut looking oh wait I didn't even show
you this oh this is so different like
way outside my comfort zones like I said
trying to branch out I got this Jean
embroidered jacket which is so fun I've
been getting a jean jacket and this
obviously is like all this embroidery I
just go floral print it just like a
super fun jacket and the back is really
cool too it's like a skull but those are
birds I didn't even notice that that's
all I got from Urban Outfitters
I mean I might as well just show you the
jacket I'm wearing too I got from All
Saints when I was in San Francisco and I
know this is just an urban outfitters
all but I guess this is like a little
bonus if you made it to the end I were
gonna style name of this but I remember
that they had it like a darker black
color and
had a more kind of like distressed
looking one that was like a little bit
lighter black and I got that lighter
more distressed looking one because it
was just more comfy and kind of like
squishing and scrunchies and like a
really stiff black jack' version of this
and my favorite part of it is just the
quilted details right here because I
have a jacket that looked just like this
from boohoo and then I lost it I can't
believe it and I have like quilted
details on it as well so I was just like
in love with it and looks like you know
a Gretchen invest any good with the
jacket so got that VIP nuts over this
home video thank you guys so much for
watching I'll see my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
