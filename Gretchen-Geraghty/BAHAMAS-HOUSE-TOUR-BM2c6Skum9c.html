house tour and this is Mandy and this is
Lucy my cousin and my twin sister a lot
of you may know I just want to give a
little intro my family is when I'm to go
on vacation together so we just decided
to rent this house in the Bahamas for
the week it's been so much fun I just
thought it would be really cool to show
you guys a little house tour because
this house is like really cool and
interesting and I just think it would be
a really fun video to watch if any of
you and your families are like actually
considering renting it because after you
see it you'll probably want to it's such
a cool house you can email my business
email and like ask me about it and I'll
give you more information about that
without further ado let's just get into
the house tour because this house is
like literally amazing and I just
thought I would share it with you so
when you first walk in the door like we
just did this is like the little foyer
area and there's some cool like statues
and like if this is what you see that's
the kitchen and there's the beach babe
it's a hoot men there's the front door
where we just came in and there's like
really cool like skylights and like high
ceilings and that's looking down into
the living room some bedrooms and like
the family room which we'll get into a
little bit and there's the kitchen which
goes into like the whole back deck in
pool area and there's like the other
wing which is like our room Randall's
room Randall and Mandy's parents room my
aunt and uncle
down there and there's the dining room
so I guess the first place we will take
you to is the dining room and there's
like lots of cool like pictures and
decorations everywhere this is the
dining room I don't really have to say
about it there's like cool paintings and
like a glass table there's lots of like
windows and like doors everywhere which
I like there's like a sliding door that
goes like out front and lots of like
mirrors - this is the dining room yeah
yeah
next we'll go to our room which is in
here we wanted to have a cart a little
door that goes like I'm to the back
porch and everything so that's why we
decided to share this room in desirable
size bed if you also notice - how many
freakin clothes we have jammed in them
there and we have three drawers full of
clothes enrolling here for a week so
it's a little crazy we have some pillow
pets there's the back porch it's
actually spreading meat cloudy out right
now I don't know if you can tell but we
were like tanning before that's why I
really bathing suit most of these rooms
are really nice too because they have
like bathrooms with them so this is like
our little bathroom and has two sinks
and there's all of the like toiletries
we brought and there's me again and it
connects like to our little like toilet
and like shower part which is in here
and yep just like normal little shower

uncle Ritchie's room which is in here is
just like another master bedroom this is
like their little shower area

bedroom is Randall's bedroom which is
this one I think this was just like a
full-size bed like ours and there's just
like window and he has a closet - oh but
he's a boy so he didn't bring me as many
clothes he has his own little bathroom
but yeah this one's cool - and he has
his own little shower - and I really
like all the decorations in this house

apart which i think is so cool and i
think is that a closet yeah well I
didn't even go in there I guess there's
like a walk-in closet in there that's
cool and there may be some more closets
and stuff and there's a good little
vanity area you could probably like do

jacuzzi job with
like windows around it but there's like
a fence so no one can like watch it

trees I think it's so pretty we still
have to take a tub in here before we
leave we like to like pose here and
pretend like we're supermodels there's
their shower which is like also really
super cool and I don't take showers in
