got a new black dress or later have a
dress to wear and yeah basically we just
figured out that we're going to go buy a
cheap suitcase somewhere that we can
find so that we can check another bag on
the way back because there's no way all
this is fitting in our suitcase so we
just got back do you guys want to be let
in on a little secret
and my vlog watchers will really know I
couldn't wear underwear in this dress so
I'm not picking up a little bit all of
you know who met me today what's going
commando but you know you gotta do what
you gotta do especially in a white tight
dress like this because it's like really
tight on the bottom so I couldn't wear
even like a new thong cuz so able to see
it so it's fun I felt free and we just
got a bunch of stuff and I'm debating
whether or not to go my ball
I like really wanted to at first but I
don't want it to seem like I'm like
bragging or anything like my in my
thoughts we're like oh look I'd be like
sharing the experience with the people
that couldn't come and I could like
surely all the samples they were giving
out cuz they were giving them out to
people that went to like it wasn't just
in the talent like lounge even though it
was easier to get it in the challenge
because there was many lines but
I don't know I guess I won't probably I
don't know maybe I'll think I'll think
about it but ya know soon we gotta go
buy a suitcase and then it was time for
party to go to tonight that'll be fun I
don't know if I'm really gonna like blog
there anything but they look see Tasha
and I are about to go to Target would
you said isn't amah exciting and I put
on a lipstick we got at NYX which is
really exciting I forgot to fix my chip
nail before we went and I'm really mad
at myself
but yeah and the next bit of cool braid
in my hair and I like it I'm gonna start
doing my hair like that more often and
yeah look at all the palm trees somebody
in the vlog I put up from here was like
it's crazy I get so excited about them
because I see them every day but they're
just so cool Tasha had to get that to
bring home all of our goodies inside I
know it's such a pain and now I'm
getting sushi and Tasha's get it she got

macaroni salad and to get blue and for
those of you that are wondering I know
you're gonna say how can you guys go to
hear me and well I give the vegetable
ones so no worries we just got all ready
to go to the after-party and I think I
made the executive decision that I'm not
gonna bring my blog camera with us
because I just carry it around so much
stuff today and I just don't really
bringing it but if I feel like it and if
I can and it was like good enough
lighting because I cook it's gonna be
dark I will talk with my phone and I'm
wearing the dress that I got yesterday
for exactly this occasion it's just this
black line from LA

cheap too and oh yeah I showed it in the
blog I think it was twenty dollars
twenty four dollars so yeah I'm super
excited
Dave's been such a long day choice and I
realize we've been getting so tired
because we would leak Ram's so long
socially every day like we've just been
doing so much so
so that was so fun I think I took like a
like two minute click obvious like us
and Mikey endlessly basically just like
gelled the whole time and like it was so
fun that one guy was such a good dancer
and I don't know his name I wish I did
and I don't know if I should say this or
not because I'm scared he's gonna see it
okay obviously he doesn't watch my
videos they're like no me at all but I
met Casper and I literally died like how
Leo thinking yep so my was like talk to
him me know I'm like pee my pants I was
