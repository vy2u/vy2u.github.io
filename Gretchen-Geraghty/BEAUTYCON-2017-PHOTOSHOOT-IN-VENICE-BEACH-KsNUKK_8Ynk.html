normally it's like finding the exit now
I'm in La Douce on my blog yesterday
just got here to my hotel I have some
music playing cause I'm getting ready
for a beauty calm day one I remember
yesterday I thought that was a pool
because it was really dark out just
grass so I just finished up putting on
my makeup on turn my hair is a mess but
it's cuz we're going to dry bar right
now and it looks kind of like lighter
than my body because I was spray tan but
actually in real life it's okay and this
is the look I just didn't put on my lips
yeah because I'm gonna do that after dry
bar because it wasn't coming off you
know I foundation like all over them
it's actually not even Foundation I've
been using the it cosmetics CC cream
definitely a fave also showed it in my
most recent like makeup tutorial like
everyday look with what I've been doing
so definitely watch that if you want to
see how this looks and then I just added
fake eyelashes because it's beautycon
you gotta go all out
Myra's on its way I'm going to pick up
Tasha and we're gonna have to drive are
running a little late as usual so got a
jet
koats drive our field guys look at our
different postulates of their contact
but they look so good you just look like
a different person yeah it's a great
drive our experience as always my guide
took a picture of me after did you see
he told me that I look like Brooklyn
so they need like you know Hogan a
wrestler I don't get hurt he's like it's
his daughter
superbunny I always look so good
my ten year old self is like shaking we
were just checking in and got our little
talent wristbands entire bangs was on a
golf court I'm getting escorted out and
and they almost lost one of her policy
behind and she was like wait wait wait
they're coming and I was just like she
saw me staring at her but that's okay
she's a queen in real life too let me
tell you we just took some pigs and now
we're gonna do this little Instagram
shoe and there's like a rotating thing
with smoke it looks so fun
oh my god love love this brush yeah like
really soft wow I'm so impressed we had
to like check it and there's everyone
and all the brands
we're gonna go out to take off her shoes
because oh you just put back on
Percy you are really struggling so shoes
are the key to shoes and they're the
most uncomfortable
recruitment
and this is everybody I think there's a
lot more like open space this year you
know what I mean like last year there is
like more brands or the brands were like
all around the room and there were so
many people like squish in the middle so
it's kind of more like room this year
which is nice
okay give me your best runway walk yes
make your 18 seconds count everything
we're leaving beautycon we're exhaust
we're gonna go yeah that's gonna be
bleep down my golf cart and we have four
seconds left
but we are the party here

the bathroom but I think she's my flap
on her bow
