to be my beauty con la 2016 haul video
and I actually decided I did not want to
film a beauty con la hold video now I
mentioned it in a vlog too that I didn't
want to because I didn't want to come
off it's like bragging in any way since
I did get everything I'm going to show
in this video for free since I'm a
creator with YouTube and you guys don't
know if you are YouTube creator or just
other like normal famous people go to I
guess so if you're in the town lash all
these brands just had all these
different tables where they're just
giving out free stuff oh yeah like I
said I didn't want to film this haul
video because I didn't want you guys to
think I was bragging at all because I
know most people aren't able to
experience like going to the town lounge
and getting free stuff but in the blog
where I said like listen I'm not gonna
do it the overwhelming response was like
please do in any way just like share
your experience with us so I figured
like okay so Senna's I am huge ready to
film it for you guys I already filmed
the video and you're about to see I'm
not wearing the same clothes like I
filmed it like a day or two ago but
right now I just had to read from the
intro because my stupid memory card it
deleted the intro to this video luckily
what is cool that I'm like filming the
intro after reticulum the video is I can
look back and like tell you guys some
things I already like so the blush is a
finish on this video from a facility
really like I'm wearing one of them
right now

liked this hair Sam I put in my hair and
I blow dried it it makes it so soft and
nice and like not poofy and it's the red
can pillow proof pillow dry little pink
sample that I'm going to show you in
this video so yeah I really really
really would recommend that that was
like super awesome and yeah without
further ado let's just get on into the
haul video also too since I had to fly
home from LA all these things are out of
their packaging because I know it would
be a lot easier to fit it all in my
suitcase if I didn't have its packaging
so like the first thing I'm showing you

doesn't have its packaging and it's the
colossal spider effect I haven't tried
