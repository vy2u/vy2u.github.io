super super super super super super
exciting video to share with you I'm
literally so excited and the day has
finally come March 31st here we are okay
so I will just tell you what it is I
actually designed a t-shirt
OhLaLa that you guys can purchase and
I'm literally so excited it came out
just as I wanted it's available online
on real Styles website and I was able to
design this piece as my first product in
my very own line and we basically just
manufactured it for me and gave me a
good platform to sell it on and I'm
literally just so excited because this
is exactly how I wanted it to turn out
and I just love it so much as of now
this is the only shirt that I have on
there because I kind of wanted to just
try to see how this one worked out on
how you guys like this one and then
maybe if you guys like it a lot and like
want more I can like try to design more
shirts or things along that line like
I'll totally like listen to what you
guys have in mind so let's just get into
me like showing you what it looks like
alright alright alright basically as you
can probably tell it's just a white like
flowy t-shirt just like I wanted because
it's like super comfy that way I just
like it really loose-fitting soft shirt
and it's so comfortable and it's just
this white color because I thought like
what goes with pretty much everything
and then the graphic design as you can
tell so it's actually a picture of me
and my twin sister Lucy and this is us
just over the summer and actually across
the street from our lake house in a
field we were having a good little photo
shoot and so what I did is I made the
picture black and white and I actually
blurred it out a little bit because
that's like the look I was going for so
it's a little bit like faded looking I
got some my inspiration from just like
other graphic t-shirts that I have and
that I've seen of just kind of laid-back
t-shirts that have a black and white
kind of faded out like graphic designs
on them and I trying to find a picture
that I thought would be like
recognizable I want people to see this
shirt and be like hey like that's glv
shirt so so yeah it is Lucy and me but I
also wanted it to be something wearable
look I want it to be assured that you
guys can wear and style and that I would
like to iron style I knew if it was
assured that I wanted to wear that you
guys would run away or change so I wore
it to school today and I actually got
comment
people liked it I was like surprised
that's me and Lucy like that picture
right there I'm really like obsessed
with it and I came out just how I wanted
and I hope you guys like it too and if
you get it we can be twinsies and you
could like tweet pictures at me I can
make a cup a collage and we can all be
twins and like wearing my shirt and that
would literally just be awesome and and
and and a little sneak preview if you're
wondering like how you could wear it or
how I wear it I'm going to show you
right here this is what I wore to school
today I just wore this white shirt with
his graphic design of Lucy and I on it
and I wore it with some ripped jeans
from American Eagle you couldn't just
wear it and look any like skinny jeans I
think and I cut those jeans with like
booties because I just like the way like
slouchy shirts look with like cuffed
jeans and booties and I also threw in
just like a military green and Iraq
jacket and I think like any like big
jackets over it just like style it
really well too and since it's just a
white graphic shirt you honestly can
wear with like anything like sweaters
jackets whatever you want just by itself
like I would wear it just like this like
I could have touched on before my
inspiration for it was I want it to be a
shirt that was wearable I thought this
picture of Lucy and I would work perfect
it reminded me of like other kind of
graphic design like t-shirts I've seen
before so yeah if you do like my shirt
and want to purchase it so we can be
twins it'll be linked first in the
downbar in the little description
section so just go ahead and click on
that and you can get to the same shirt
as me and I'm so happy and fun facts
which I thought was really really cool
is that this shirt was actually made
like in North America because I feel
like everything is imported from like
China and so but this shirt is actually
produced in North America so like how
cool is that
plus if you decide that you want to get
it you will get free shipping across
Canada and the US so yeah you don't even
have to worry about shipping all you
have to do is cover the cost of the
t-shirt itself so that's really fun
who doesn't like for free shipping yes
yeah I'm just so excited I've literally
been like planning this for so long you
don't even know how long I've been
working on this because it took me a
while to contemplate like what I wanted
my shirt to look like and if I wanted
like words on it cuz I wanted to be a
shirt that was me but I didn't wanted to
be sure that just said like Christian
loves Beauty because I know I wouldn't
want to wear that you guys probably
wouldn't eat there it wouldn't really
like go with a lot of things but I
thought this was really versatile and
you could like dress it up or dress
down you can almost even like tuck it in
with like a skirt and like booties I
would be cute too I'm just like thinking
of all these ideas if I had to look how
you could wear it it's gonna be in my
next after the week actually but yeah
this is just like my announcement video
just so you guys know I did create a
shirt and I'll probably be releasing
some more like clothing items throughout
the year so you can keep like checking
back to that page I'm just starting out
with this one and yeah I guess that just
covers about everything like I said it's
linked in the downbar and I hope you can
get it too and we can just wear it
together this is awesome this is like a
dream come true I'm so happy that I was
able to do this thank you guys so much
for watching and I will see you my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
