really exciting holiday for you guys
it's literally the biggest haul video of
all time I'm not even kidding when I
tell you my whole bed right here is
covered in clothes and I'm about to show
you all of it
I guess just really quick I'll show you
guys the stuff that I've been buying on
Joe and if you guys know me you already
know it so it is you ready now it's my
favorite shopping app ever it has all my
favorite stores like Urban Outfitters
packs tiny little lemon Sephora Mac made
well blah blah blah the list goes on and
on so I just picked up a couple things
from there the first time I got is just
from Urban Outfitters it's just this
sheer floral top so cute then I got this
like cream white kind of cropped peplum
top just like a t-shirt top and you
might even notice that from blogs I wore
it when I visited my best friend Abbey's
home my back ain't no Western Mass and
then these three tops are all from
PacSun because packs puns on Joe as well
oh and don't forget you can use the code
question to get five dollars off and
free shipping off your first order and
dope which literally is like a $5 gift
card to any sort that's on there so
you're welcome and go spend it because
you've been wanting anything on there
from my Urban Outfitters express made
well max the floor above off it is just
like five dollars off anything even
wedding so yeah from PacSun I got this
black top which they actually had at
Urban Outfitters like the exact same one
but they stopped selling it so then I
found it on toe on PacSun and I was like
yes I love this perfect for going out
and I just got this read it straight
across a body suit and I've been wanting
a Rindge body suit like this that is
straight across for so long I also got
this red crop top it's just like a
little t-shirt crop top my friend Maggie
McDonald here on YouTube hey Mikey love
you I love your vlog so much and she
actually showed this I think in a haul
video and I was like I need it it's just
a red playing little crop top it from
it's actually John gall I think yeah so
it's like brandy melville PacSun but you
know how they celebrate day it packs up
whatever alright moving on to you guys
like shopping Express because Express to
me has always been there and maybe I
have some things like here and there
from Express but I've never actually
gone there like gone shopping been like
I want to give a bunch of stuff in there
but I literally went in and like since
when has all our stuff in so cute
literally everything was so cute I went
like wild so yeah be prepared this is a
lot of stuff from Express so the first
thing I notice is these two beautiful
like off-the-shoulder sweaters they are
literally perfect guys they're just kind
of like roughly down the front and it's
like cup sleeves a bit
and you can actually wear them off the
shoulder like this or you can wear it
kind of the cowl-neck up around your
neck like that so literally these are
just like perfect and I love the dark
green color and I also loved this really
light gray color and they're so fuzzy
and warm and I really got so many
compliments because I've been wearing
them a bunch already also I feel like I
have no idea what size I am and like any
store and I'm within between all these
million different sizes and I can be
literally an extra small or small or a
medium and they all fit and like this is
a perfect example so I saw this black
shirt actually online from Express and
it's just this black tank top and I've
been wanting like a black tank top like
choker top like this and I thought it
was so cute and then I noticed they only
have it an extra small and I was kind of
bummed and I was like you know I'm gonna
order anyway Steve it fit and it
literally fits perfect so just know that
whatever size you order on express it'll
probably thank you because literally all
their sizes fit me then I got this black
skirt because I don't have a black skirt
I literally don't have a black skirt
like what I used to have a black really
cute skirt from Urban Outfitters and
that this summer I lost no chance oh is
that about remember it was like suede
and had like leather down the middle I
don't know if you ever so I got this a
black skirt from Express and it's kind
of more like business you like you
literally can wear slip businesses like
an a-line skirt and it's a really nice
material but I also have worn it out so
you can like dress it down as well oh my
gosh how I never gets mentioned before
every to mention literally everything in
this whole video what we listed down
below so definitely go check it out so
we can be twins and become are the same
stuff and tweet me pictures and you get
the same stuff as me because it's really
like everything everyone we're twinning
and all of this stuff is seriously so
cute and like a lot of them have pretty
good deals so yeah feel like I know on
Express you can use the code two to
eight four and you can get 15% off of
everything on Express so definitely
utilize that because literally
everything is so cute and you'll see in
this haul I also got a bunch of bottoms
and jeans because I literally like never
find bottoms that fit me and I have
straight-up no jeans so I kind of like
crazy from the jeans these are one pair
got from Express so cute I wore this
with a sweater that I got from Toby
which you'll see in a bit to class the
other day and I got so many compliments
these jeans are just really cute and
they have kind of a darker wash at the
bottom which looks really cool they're a
little distressed got a bunch
compliments definitely trickling
tableaus you can find the exact one and
then the other pair of jeans I got from
Express or just some dark wash skinny
jeans because like I said I really had
no jeans and for size reference I got a
two in both of these jeans they fit
perfect in the store I was like you know
I literally don't need like sweatshirts
there's my pants anymore like I like a
jillion but I saw these camo sweatshirts
that were like these softest things in
the world you have to go to Express and
just at least feel the inside of these
they're so soft and comfy so I got this
in two colors because I figured you're
both so cute and then maybe like Lucy
can wear it and we could be twinning
twins and just got kind of a light camel
version of it which I don't really see
this like light camo color law so I
thought this was so cute and then just
like the dark green normal camo version
of it then I got this white v-neck
t-shirt it's so soft and comfy and
tailor you guys know her best friend
roommate bill is here she actually had
this white shirt from Express and she
said it's like the softest best t-shirt
ever so I got it and literally it just
like the best basic white tee cuz I just
didn't have one then I got this black
long-sleeve a bodysuit it's kind of like
plunging down the front and I actually
had one from American Apparel that
looked just like this it was black bunny
bunny suit long-sleeve and I lost it so
this is like the same but from express
and it's super cute I recommend since I
think American Apparel is out of
business now is it let me know then the
last thing I got from express what camo
yeah and what's weird it's like the
three Camel things I got none of them
are the same camos and this is more like
a blue grey camo but it's also so cute I
got these in a medium so they'd be so
big and comfy and yeah they're just like
long camo sweatpants with the same
really fuzzy material as the other
camera sweatshirts next I'm gonna show
you must guide it and just remember bear
with me here this is like people always
holiday of all time I'm trying to move
through quick if you couldn't notice but
it's just a lot of stuff it's a to be a
Darrell to your face yeah okay so I got
this black tank top wait wait first of
all misguided can we just talk really
quick I've never gotten anything from
misguided and like literally everything
I got is so freaking cute you're gonna
see you when I try to I'm like I'm just
obsessed of everything and like where is
misguided been hiding from me because I
don't know I don't
everything's adorable and I got this
black tank top it's just like Ola
propped a little roughly flares out a
little bit then I got this black off the
shoulder dress it kind of swings out and
is a little flurry and it's just so
flattering and cute on and I got that
same black dress but in red it's just
off the shoulder I feel if you can see
the details better on the red one
because it's like lighter I really would
recommend these oh I know like sizing
from a bunch of these different stores
can be a little hard especially like
misguided I'm gonna show you stuff from
boohoo and it can be tricky because
they're like on line and I'm like I
don't know but pretty much I just follow
the size guides on all of them and they
all turn out fine and some stuff I even
got and like different sizes on the
website just because I like certain body
contrast is tighter and then turn like
just hurts your pants looser but they
all turned out fine so that's what I
have to say about sizing and then also
from sky you know I got this white body
too this is so cute guys I love that
it's just like really flowy right there
and you can kind of make it more
conservative because it's not
conservative at all you can try to make
it more closer together to cover more of
your boobs or like pull it out and show
more of your boots then I know this red
dress please let me know where I can
wear this like actually let me know like
what you think because I think it is so
beautiful look if it was in black I
could wear it to like a date night or
something like that
I feel like red is a little crazy for
like nighttime maybe it's like a holiday
party if I wanted to look a little alone
worth guy because it's like very tight
and body con but it does cover a lot
it's like long-sleeve and it's like so
flattering on I feel like just so
beautiful I like love the lace and I
love the red color so this is like a
bang and dress like I feel like everyone
looks so hot and then smooth and this to
me people who dress guys oh my god for
me Scotty this is so cute I love the
plunging neckline like it just looked so
good and my roommate's really oh he
looks so good on you so literally very
flattering again I love the plunging
neckline and it's also like very
conservative the back so it's like this
is in the back party the thread then
this pink dress I got is actually I hope
okay for recruitment
we have recruitment here in the spring
for I will see you just got this shirt
by the way how cute is it hopefully this
isn't too like scandals because I know
it kind of plunges a little deep but
we'll see if it's okay basically long
story short I just want to get this verb
crew met I don't get such a cute blush
pink dress and I notice this is a little
bit more expensive than the other stuff
on that website
misguided overall I feel like is pretty
affordable this is a little more
but it's a really nice dress and I just
think it's adorable and this dress you
guys might recognize for my blogs at
style con I thought it was so different
than like any dress I ever owned and it
should look a double-layer lace
beautiful dress I think it's so
conservative and classy and elegant
looking because it goes like higher up
on your neck it was just short sleeves
and different than my style normally but
like so beautiful oh within this top
from misguided is scandalous just how I
like it it's just like a choker top
around the top it's like chiffon and
kind of like see-through a little bit
obviously so open in the front so right
up my alley obviously and then I got
this white jumpsuit from misguided it's
just like a strapless white jumpsuit
it's out a little bit in the middle in
the front and I do like this the only
thing I don't like is I feel like the
pants are really flare II and I think a
lot of the jumpsuit I have the pant legs
are just really really wide and like
loose which is like I know the style of
the jumpsuit but I want to get a
jumpsuit that's like tighter on the legs
so if you have any recommendations let
me know in the comments this is still
like super cute okay the last thing I
promised got you guys is so wild but
they're like really fun I tried that
with the white bodysuit that I showed
you from us kinda which doesn't work at
all because you need to wear like
something higher up with the bodysuit
since it starts higher up and just
whatever but the pants themselves are
really cool you would just wear it since
we're really low waisted with like a
longer top you're like leather pants
I've never had leather pants and these
just looked really sick I like the
zipper detail these will be super fun
too and dress up then I'll show you guys
stuff that I got from boohoo and this is
all from their holiday line I know
because everything I want to show you is
literally like velvet or sparkly or like
dresses or whatever but first I'll show
you what to bodycon dress is that me and
my best friend Abbi are wearing it to a
date party tonight I'm actually going to
be wearing this black long-sleeve it
tight body con velvet dress it just has
a little choker at the top obviously so
beautiful and I'm so excited to wear it
and then Abbi is going to wear this in
navy blue a long-sleeve one it's just
like really soft the velvet is so nice
and it just kind of has like cutouts
right there both these are literally a
so beautiful and I know I'm gonna get
like so much wear out of them and like I
said I'm really went crazy on the velvet
but you
this color I just think is so beautiful
I don't even know describe it it's kind
of like a Navi purpley pink color and
it's this really cool cut style of dress
house look the choker again beleve like
plunging neckline and then the bottom I
think is really cool kind of like wraps
over and it's like long in the back I
got this really it's sparkly a long
sleeve top from Baloo it's black and
silver like stripes and I know this is
like wild and I feel like different than
what I would normally wear but I thought
it would be it so cool for like New
Year's or just like the holidays this
dress is so fun I think I'd wear if I
had like a gala to go to in the holidays
or I don't know because it's look really
long like elegance like maxi dress but
I'm sure a bunch of you like have clove
it's you can wear it too and yeah what
should I wear this to maybe I'll just
wear it for like a Christmas party back
home if it's like nicer it's just like
obviously a green velvet really long
maxi dress that kind of like ties are
the ways to click a little present and
then the last thing I got from boohoo is
just this long-sleeve sparkly tan and
like Rose sequined dress which is super
cool looking interesting for the
holidays it's like mesh on the sleeves I
know this is like thrown in towards the
end of the hall that you hear but when I
went to go visit my best friend Hannah
he goes in Hannah she goes TVM and I was
there for a whole weekend and there's
this shop on Church Street that her
friend Cara works at and it's called
echo and it's the cutest boutique I
literally went insane and I boutique
like I just went crazy I really wanted
to buy everything
me and Hannah took little pictures out
front and like models in their clothes
and guys the stuff I got I am like
obsessive so all the stuff there is like
a little more pricey it's like so worth
it and emerg told you earlier I
literally had no jeans well I got a few
pairs of jeans here so we're in luck can
now have jeans I don't want to sound
like bratty at all right now look I
don't mean like this but I've never had
like designer jeans like really nice
expensive jeans and I feel like now I
can like actually tell the difference
because these three genes were all
pretty pricey but like they're so nice
in the way they like fit my body like
they're so flattering so I highly
recommend maybe just trying out with one
pair of more expensive jeans instead of
getting like a bunch of like cheap ones
I don't know but these are just like
perfect and they just fit me so well so
the first pair of jeans I got I was
obsessed with like the wash of them
because I just love like this dark blue
and they're kind of like faded looking
at the top and they
like really good on your butt and I'm
just like dark-wash skinny jeans I would
recommend going a size down because I
feel like this skinny yet fit isn't that
skinny like I like my skinny jeans like
really skinny and like tight and these I
feel her a little bit more like straight
leg so I got these in at 26 so normally
I'm like at 27 in jeans but these are
just perfect and they are Paige denim
which I think they have like Nordstrom
as well but yeah these paintings are
just like so soft like butter and I love
them then these jeans actually really
funny this branch a Goldy a gold a gold
I've never heard of it but they have
literally the best of a bunch of the
stuff ministry right now is brand these
kind of dark blue black high waisted
distressed jeans but like the really
cool detail at the bottom like guys like
its distrust each other but I think I've
been looking for jeans like this because
I think it's just like so flattering
like trendy right now but I never
thought that I would like these I
remember he had to turn them on and like
oh my god they look so good on you
girlfriend but like those won't look out
of me I don't know I tried them on I'm
like oh my gosh I'm obsessed with these
like these are literally so pretty and I
feel like unique and different than like
a bunch of jeans are out there so these
are just awesome and these are actually
my size yeah they're 27
they're just perfect and and then I
actually found this black denim skirt
which you've seen my Instagram if you
seen a certain item that I'm gonna show
last in this haul video I got this black
tin a skirt from there as well from eko
eko eko oh my god am i saying wrong i
don't even know but it's also a Goldy
and that's what that tag looks like if
you have seen it for today this is also
yeah my normal size 27 and just black
skirts literally fits me perfect I'm
obsessed with it and I feel is on sale
too so I was like a little less
expensive than how expensive it really
is still expensive and then these jeans
are so cute guys there by the brand
mother which I also haven't heard it
before but Abby has she said they're
good these were quite expensive but they
literally fit perfect I think these are
in a yeah these ones are a 26
they're like more light wash have a
bunch of rips and the reason I'm
obsessed with these is the bottom they
have like the same a dark kind of a
distressed bottom as its expressed genes
I showed you earlier I'm gonna be
totally different wash that don't worry
they're different enough these are just
like it's such nice jeans
happy I'd like good pairs of hands to
wear now then the last thing I got from
echo boutique echo I think it's like oh
is this a black velvet dress literally I
went ham on the velvet in this hall
video like I think I'm just in the
moment cuz it's like the holidays but
yeah it's like this black velvet it
looks so good and like elegant and I
really like the straps were like
stretchy it's just like comfy and fun
okay we are nearing the end guys stick
with me here I have a couple things from
Toby and then one last big thing which
I'll show you and it'll be done the
first thing I got from Toby is this top
is also this dresser strappy strapping
this job sorry stretchy just like that
black velvet dress I just showed you but
it's just this black tank top from Toby
in the back is all open so so cute and
then I got this mom this mauve why don't
you describe this with this is such a
pretty color sweater from Toby and it
goes really want on the shoulders which
be where it can kind of like slip down
on your shoulders and then completely
fall forward and show your whole boobs
so I added some fashion tape on my
shoulders to like keep it up on my
shoulders so it wouldn't fall for it in
July help boot
the reason I'm obsessed with that I got
so many compliments on it with because
the back looks like that it's just curl
I see in the back like that and the
backs all open and it just looks so cute
on so I'm obsessed with this and I wore
this with those expressed genes I talked
about earlier then this romper from Toby
guys I know I know I know more velvet I
know but look at it just look at it it's
so cute I was also contemplating wearing
this as a tea party tonight and honestly
I still might over that black velvet
dress I showed you from boohoo but I
don't know we'll see look at how cute it
is it's like this beautiful plum maroon
color and it's just the most beautiful
little romper and it has the plunging
neckline which it's obviously my
favorite it's like business in the bag
and just all covered and party in the
fridge this last thing I got from Toby
OOP into no because I wore yesterday but
I wore it with that black denim a Goldy
skirts from echo boutique it's a body
suit and it's just gray and kind of like
ribbed and like off the shoulder and the
reason I love this is because it has
like the flare II sleeves which are so
cute and I feel like really in right now
so the last thing I'm going to show you
guys you've obviously seen it already on
my Instagram the last like three
pictures in there oh and some people
have problems with it
you know what I am obsessed I just got
this Gucci belt and don't worry it
wasn't like spontaneous or anything it
was like planned out I know that I've
wanted it for so long
gives my friend it has it in silver and
I just got it in gold and it's just like
the classic black gucci belt I'm in size
34 if that means anything to you if that
helps you I just told him I was like 26
or 27 advanced okay this is perfect for
you and it's really perfect because
there's like five holes on the belt and
then when it's on like my waist like
when I wear like normal low weights of
things it's like right in the middle and
then when I wear that like high-waisted
black don't screw it from a Goldy I
would just put it on like the tightest
one so I like that you can wear it like
high or low and it's funny cuz I rent
until I find more in the Gucci store and
she lives by an exact same belt so yeah
it's just so great I'm just as estimate
and I didn't even realize when I bought
it but it's literally my initials like
it's GG so it's meant to be and I know
that now because some of your commenting
it on my Instagram that it's my initials
is of it so yeah that is the end of this
haul video I really hope you guys
enjoyed I'm obviously freaking obsessed
with clothes and have a problem and
can't stop shopping but so what is new
I'm GL P over here so I hope you guys
like like this video if you liked all
the clothes I was gonna split it up into
different haul videos and I'm like how

time yeah and don't forget everything
