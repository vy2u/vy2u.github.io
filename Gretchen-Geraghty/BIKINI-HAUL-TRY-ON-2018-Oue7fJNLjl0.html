dancing on my family
yes
hey everyone so today I have a swimsuit
haul video for you guys
and there is just so many of these
students that I picked up from
thoughtful I love them you guys know
that like I've literally showed some
suits from Savile for so long now
obviously pictures on my Instagram it's
awful like Emma
Maggie wear them too and everyone's
gonna ask how's actually on our
Instagram post since we've been here in
Laguna like oh my god where those from
it's awful so many verbatim sister from
Tomball first one I will show you guys
is this strict one and I'm gonna start
off with like some of my favorites
because I tried this on last night and I
was like Maggie this is so cute she was
like you look so good in that and it's
just this white top with like blue
stripes you can see the style I really
like the stripes of this because I'm
like a stripe girl I'm obsessed and
these ones are actually kind of like
cover more you know because some
actually most of our babies are pretty
like cheeky like some of the ones in
here you'll see so it's kind of good for
me to get some ones with coverage in
case you're with people that your whole
bunch gonna be thinking yeah
then we got this navy blue one with just
some white trim and maggie has a bathing
suit that looks just like this rooms
awful as well so this kind of looks like
that they also have so and many freaking
bathing suits on there and then these
are the bottoms that go with your just
maybe blue I really think out of these I
can tell they're gonna be like super
flattering they're a little more cheeky
we like the cheeky ones because you know
what would you call girlfriend also I
know that it's awful like it's super
affordable like if you can tell you can
get like so many bathing suits like
normally I wouldn't buy like 32 amazing
suits or whatever but like at a time but
you can it's awful because it's
literally they're like so much cheaper I
know they range from like 10 to like 20
dollars that's most of their bathing
suits and like nowadays I feel like you
can get a top for like 30 or 40 dollars
so it's really nice having like more
cheap bathing suits because then you can
get more and ones that
you know and then also I know that if
you spend above $30 you'll get free
worldwide shipping so that is lip I
didn't even know that oh I guess did you
tell you I actually got mediums and all
of these because I used to get like
smalls for everything on it's awful like
all the bathing suits I found were
smiles but I noticed that their bottoms
I would say run pretty small on the tops
due to like generally they run small I
know that's kind of like a known thing
like a lot of people say it's awful runs
like a size small so I would recommend
sizing if you don't like your bathing
suits like really tight I still have
some smalls that'll wear but like
mediums are kind of more enjoyable
hopeful you can't hear that beeping yeah
so these are the mediums but I would say
they like fit as a small because
normally I get smiles in bathing suits
okay then this style you'll see I've
really been enjoying because I got a
bunch like this but this is just a white
and navy blue striped top again we
really like the stripes and I really
like this scoop neck design of these
because I just think they're like really
flattering and cute these are just the
bottoms feel bit and then these two
bathing suits are actually the same
style just some different colors and
this is like a maroon a red one again
like I just think this just so cool and
I like that there's like a little band
right there they like cover more so I
don't know I just think it's really cute
you can even wear with like shorts and
it could be like a crop top and I like
the cut of these bottoms as well they're
like a little more cheeky for those of
you that like cheeky things and then
this is the same one but in yellow and I
have like no yellow bathing suit so I
know this will make you look so tan as
well okay then this mean and we're just
saying is litter
gonna make you look so tan girlfriend
because it's like this bright orange e
pink coral color and I love the
scalloped detail like scalloped details
on swimsuits are just so adorable and in
the bottoms just to go with this is
slipping gonna be my new favorite it's
been all of you ask me on insta where
it's from you will know the og people
will know it sounds awful these are
actually the same one but I got two
different colors and this white one I
actually had before when I went to Miami
I posted pictures in it but I left it in
Miami so I had to order it again and
it's just like this white off the
shoulder on top and again you can
literally wear this is a good crop top
we've like high-waisted jeans shorts and
it looks like so cute and then just
plain white bottoms to go with and then
I got a royal blue same literally things
like things do but it's just like the
royal blue version again love like the
off the shoulder detail and in the
matching bottoms to go with and then
this me and Maggie had fun too my gun
yesterday and I just thought this looked
so fun like I had to get this one it's
like this like Mexican crochet style
like top and then the bottoms to go it
so it's like a little two-piece set and
I just like this is so fun guys's
bottoms right a little small and cheeky
but I think that's like so pointed them
you know what I mean like you're like
the beach you can go in frolic in the
sand and then that's my plan anyway
so I like that a lot this I actually had
this exact top you guys remember this
summer I remember the whole I showed
again I was in here to be my friend but
I have this exact top and like this
white cream color and I wore it a bunch
of nantucket it this gives me like a
Nantucket vibes and
it's just like crochet and cute I love
it oh and this so like I got some like
crop tops kind of more close with this
because they look close as well and
awful and this white top looks actually
identical to a white crop top I have
from Urban Outfitters but I lost that
one and this looks exactly the same and
is probably like update of the price so
this is super cute definitely recommend
we love little crop tops like this that
are high waisted things oh and then this
so you probably recognize maybe I don't
know this I have a royal blue velvet
swimsuit that looks just like this
result all as well but this one's kind
of like a more medium royal blue and my
other ones like darker so I've literally
got another one because I wear it so
much and I'm obsessed with it I wanted
fourth of July if you saw pictures of me
in that from like instant or whatever
this is like super cute I love like the
velvet trend and I think I like these
bottoms more than the other ones they're
like super cheeky and be like okay okay
so then this one it's just black and me
and Evan we're just saying that we'd
like see this one around on Instagram
and the Styles like super dope you can't
really see it in fact I was like really
cute and just like different and new I
feel I've just seen pictures of girls in
it and there's definitely like more
expensive ones in this and this one's
way more affordable so if I so recommend
this one it's kind of like trendy and
then you just got some matching bottoms
to it these are also gonna be so cute
look how they like dip down in the
middle and stuff like for me really
flattering
you have in Zener I know they definitely
seem like blogs and stuff so yeah
basically we're really excited to go try
all these puppies out on the beach my
favorites are these ones I really like
yeah
these are gonna be so cute let me go to
the beach right now I can't wait because
