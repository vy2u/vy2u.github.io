video and I've been wanting to own this
video for a while now just talked to you
guys in my life so I've also to make
sure to Instagram and ask you guys to
leave your questions down below and I
said you can make the questions really
personal to do so this Q&amp;amp;A is gonna get
a little personal but I really consider
you guys like close friends like
obviously I'm going to tell you my
personal life you know you don't follow
me on Instagram you totally should it's
just a Gretchen loves beauty you can
also add me on snapchat and me on
Twitter to keep updated with my life
when I'm not posting videos so yeah the
first question is how do you like your
sorority are you going to stay in it for
the rest of college I love my sorority
it was one of the best decisions I made
here at BU I'm so happy that I joined
alpha P and I'm definitely going to stay
in it the rest of college also I tried
to answer questions that have lots of
likes or that I saw a lot in the
comments just like it answer the most
frequently asked question what's your
plan after you graduate from bu like
what's the job sector you're aiming for
if any so it's a really good question um
don't probably end up with a job
somewhere in marketing's
are you seeing dating talking to anyone
right now and no I'm not
are you over your ex boyfriend how did
you get over him and you know I'm not
overdressed
what's your favorite way to exercise my
favorite way to exercise it definitely
is soul cycle I'm just obsessed with the
atmosphere and the vibe there it just
makes me so happy and I always have such
a good time like I truly don't think of
it as working out I think if it is going
to have a fun time like it's the best
part of my day yesterday for my class I
got this shirt there's this so humid and
I just thought it was like so cute this
I've been wanting to talk about for a
while this question says do you have any
fun things planned for the summer and
yes I do I'm actually going to be living
in New York City all summer you guys
know I'm from upstate New York so it's
really not that far from me only a
couple hours and I've just been obsessed
with New York City ever since I was a
little girl I love it there I feel like
I just arrived there no I don't have an
internship but I am living with three
friends that do Carrigan salmon addy I
can't wait for this hour it's gonna be
so fun and I thought maybe that I wanted
an internship but I realized really what
makes me happy right now is YouTube so I
really just want to focus on YouTube all
summer am I trying to work somewhere
else part time we'll see how that goes
and I also know I'm going to be
traveling a bunch in the summer with
Mandy and Montauk and obviously I'm
going to Africa and like
and I may end up visiting my friend Sara
in Hawaii we were talking about this
yesterday so cross your fingers that
that works out are you still running
that half marathon so I know you're
talking about the one that I signed up
and I trained for was actually supposed
to be this past weekend in Oklahoma I
was following a training plan I found
online I was so excited to visit my
friend Anna we were so excited to run it
together she was actually doing to the
full marathon and I was just going to do
the half because she's done a bunch of
half before and then a couple weeks ago
sadly she got a stress fracture in her
foot and she hasn't been able to run at
all she look you know Gretchen I don't
even think it's worth it for you to come
anymore because I was like really busy
here in Boston that weekend so I
literally was going to be in Oklahoma
only for like 24 hours to like run the
race and come back she's like now I
can't even run it with you like it
doesn't make sense for you to just come
all the way here and run it alone which
I did understand that and honestly I
would have been kind of sad and bummed
out running it alone so I didn't get to
go to Oklahoma and run a half marathon
which was so upsetting because I did
train for it a lot actually over the
summer I think we mentioned several
probably at a visiting Oklahoma although
I'm not running that one I actually did
sign up for new half marathon though I'm
running with Taylor and her mom it's in
my closet New York on June 11th and I'm
so excited for that wow this lighting is
so bright our color looks so washed out
and funny right now I just never really
film with my ring light so I like try
that out today and only if I'm with my
studio right so let me know what you
think of lighting you're going to make
another bucket list for this summer and
I don't think we're going to be making
another bucket list but Lizzie and I
actually do a play around daily vlogging
this summer we're not going to be
together because she can be home in
upstate New York but we're trying to
figure out how we're gonna upload vlogs
maybe we'll do like every other day or
try to combine the footage or something
and then she said when's you leave for
Africa so I think I touched on this
before I leave in 9 days it's so surreal
and I haven't like talked about it in a
while and some people are like are you
still going yes I'm going it's so insane
I've been hitting up Eastern out in
sports by like so much gear that I need
I still have so much I have to buy and
prepare for in the next nine days but I
know it's going to be a trip of a
lifetime and I can't wait and if you're
confused if this like the first video of
mine you're watching if you want to know
more about it I the whole via my channel
about it it's called I'm going to Africa
I'll have
down below long story short though I'm
hiking Mount Kilimanjaro what made you
so drawn to Alfea compared to other
sororities I just really felt like I fit
in I just loved all the girls they're
all so genuine so sweet I really could
see myself there my girl that prized me
Katie she was just like me and I felt
like our parties were going by so quick
because I just had so much I felt like I
could talk to her about and that's like
the best feeling you know and then I
really knew that it was the one for me
because some cheesy bad press night I
started crying because I was just so
emotional I felt like so close with
everyone that was like okay Gretchen
like you know where you belong if you're
like crying I'm done you know I just
really felt at home and really
comfortable and I feel like everyone
says this during recruitment but you
really just have to like trust the
system and you kind of just like feel
out where you fit in what's your
favorite and least favorite part about
being in a sorority and my favorite part
is definitely just all my new sisters
that I have I honestly love them so much
it's crazy how close you get with people
because some of my closest friends like
Abby Louisa Sam Sophie like I love you
guys so much like literally my whole
pledge class are all so sweet and
obviously my fig and Maddie B and Ariana
like I love you guys we're just so fun
to be with and honestly so kind and I
feel like you just know they're looking
out for you and I have your best
interest in mind and I just think that's
so special to Lee's favorite part is
probably just the fact that it's only
for like the four years of college which
is obvious but I feel like it just goes
by so quick my great-grand big it
graduated the year early and she's ready
in New York and like I wish I could like
hang out with Courtney here you know
what I mean and since I rush as a
sophomore I'm already like a year behind
so I'm sad I really only have like
junior and senior year left but I really
feel like it is a bomb that you're gonna
have for like a lifetime you ever regret
not running this year do you think it
was a good decision love your video
thanks Julie I was definitely the right
decision for me so my best friends are
still lightly rowing team and they love
it here and that's so great for them I
feel like just being a d1 athlete in
college really takes a specific type of
person that really wants that experience
out of college and I thought that's what
I wanted my four years and I realized
that I wanted to focus on other things
like academics other extracurriculars
that wasn't being a d1 athlete but yeah
I mean I don't regret it at all and I
think it was a good decision for me
personally do you see yourself as being
an authority when you're in high school
and no I didn't at all I thought I was
gonna roll all four years what is your
favorite memory from childhood
okay think about it honestly my mom and
just making listening pancakes on
Sundays you know pancakes pancakes are
like on Saturdays to on the weekend
shoot I would make his pancakes I feel
like that was just really fun bonding
time obviously a food memory and then
with my dad my parents are still
together by the way but with my dad I
just remember it like separately with
both of them my dad would always just
include the seen me on fun little
projects around the house like he would
teach us so much which I remember being
annoyed about like you'd be like let me
show you how to fix a toilet and I think
dad I don't care but honestly they're
like really good skills to know now that
I'm growing up and we would just do fun
little like painting projects we would
like paint benches or like redo a room
you're just going on little trips with
him like emerald we'd always go to New
York City every year but even smaller
ones like you take us to the museum and
we go to little parks and ponds and
stuff like that and it was just so fun
growing up I feel really thankful to
have parents that were such involved and
still are so involved and I might give
them a hard time when you're watching
this I love you guys so much I know you
guys just love me and Lissy so much and
you really are just looking out for us
and always have our best interests in
life might be crazy and personal but
honestly how do you always make your
boobs look so good in low-cut dresses I
said this was gonna be personal Q&amp;amp;A this
is about to get really real oh I don't
know I've like never really talked about
this and it's kind of really personal
maybe I'll talk about it in other videos
coming soon but long story short I
didn't get my period for three years
honestly it was just because of working
out so much like it happened to Lucy to
all my junior high school senior of high
school and then freshman year of college
I just never got my period and then
finally this December when I saw an
ob/gyn at for the first time she was
like yeah you really need to go on birth
control because not having a parent like
isn't okay you might be parked like
osteoporosis like stuff like that and
she's like you just need to get your
cycle that's like what's healthy and I
always thought it was fine to not have
it like my other doctors were like oh
it's fine like you're an athlete that
just happens I probably some of you that
like run track or do gymnastics or just
like workout a lot like that's what
happens but she was like yeah like you
really need to get it like I'm gonna put
you on birth control so remember the
first three months my boobs like hurt
all the time and I would like to have my
mom and she'd be like like I don't have
to say Gretchen like sorry and I think
they're hurting because they were
growing it's like thank you birth
control but I am never had boobs like my
whole life like all growing up even all
of last year never had boobs like you
guys can look back at old videos
pictures on Instagram like I was flat
and then ever since I went on birth
control like in December
the first three months of my boobs grew
so much like they're not like huge that
but now I would say like I have boobs
and I like tonight before I can think of
this one picture do when I was in Miami
with Mandy should I took a picture of me
and she's like what the heck like when
did you get food all of my friends were
like where did those come from and I
remember pictures on Instagram people
like did you get a boob job like what
bra are you wearing your like your boobs
are really perky and I'm like I'm not
wearing a bra that's really funny I
think they're like perky looking just
because they grew so fast like I don't
know this is really first of all like I
told you guys but yeah honestly made my
boobs grew I really think is birth
control or like maybe finally because I
turned 20 I don't know if that's like
the magic age that my boobs were gonna
grow I'm happy they finally did it I
mean I don't know I like never even wear
bras anymore though now which is funny
because I feel like normally people that
are really flat on my bras and I like
did when I was black because I like
wanted to look at my boobs but now that
I kind of have boobs like I never wear
bras like I'm like not right now and
like it's fine some questions what can
you tell us why you don't wear bras and
like no I still do wear bras there's a
lot of days I don't cuz I'm like kind of
more comfortable to not and yeah
everyone has nipples so if you can see
your nipples through shirt I feel like
it's not that big a deal but whatever
Abby says what is your favorite color
probably blue do you like dogs yes
what was your favorite part of
recruitment better safe this week girl
aim to have a posture that you met
nearby hi group honestly it probably was
you Abby because I love you so much
you're the sweetest little nugget and if
you work my pocket group I don't know if
you would like be this close now so
honestly is probably you good guess Sun
or moon probably Sun what is your
favorite word that's a really good
question you know there's some cinnamon
I put cinnamon on my oatmeal this
morning it was good so cinnamon was your
favorite state in the u.s. maybe you can
nor you nor did I really just say that
maybe New York just because I grew up in
upstate and I just like loved New York
City so much violet Florida
maybe one of those to you if you could
be anyone for a day who would it be
that's a really good question I've no
idea maybe like president because that
would be really cool or maybe just
someone that's like totally different
from me like I'm the opposite side of
the planet like completely different
family and traditions and customs and
stuff because it would just be cool to
like live a different life I don't know
what are you going to be doing from July
3rd through is 17th this summer I know
the answer but I want your fans to know
ok so I'm going to Nantucket
on July 3rd and I'm actually think I'm
leaving July 11th no or look I know I am
because yesterday we were together I
want my tickets to go to Nantucket I'm
so excited I've never been so if you
when you're watching this I love you
because I'm staying with you and I
didn't even tell you that I bought the
tickets yet but I'm coming and it's
gonna be really fun I just want to be
there for the 4th cuz like a bunch of my
friends are gonna be there and if you
guys are gonna be and then suck it for
the 4th I will be there he's gonna let
you know if I've any more questions
honey love you Abby do you still get
laser hair removal and has it been
successful so far
love you Gretchen I love you Meg I've
had six treatment so far and I think
that's like the end of what a lot of
people get or maybe people get eight I
don't know I think it's between six and
eight and it's been working so well like
honestly best decision I've ever made
it's just been so convenient they'll
literally show you guys so I haven't
shaved my armpits and like over a month
which like sounds gross but because hair
literally doesn't grow look if anything
like one or two hairs grow and then you
can just shave them like one someone
through once every other month I don't
even know it's been so successful like
it doesn't go away all at once but like
as the treatments go on you see like a
big improvement and it's not completely
a hundred percent gone but like I would
say 95% I've been loving laseraway
that's where I get it done and there's
like a bunch of locations on the west
coast and then I just got the one in
York City Kat says when Kamandi and I
visit again and literally tomorrow I'm
busy guys so much and the last question
I'll be answering says what's the best
part about being a twin and definitely
just the fact that she is my building
best friend I Love Lucy so much and I'm
so happy that we ended up at buta gather
I think it was just meant to be so thank
you guys so much for watching this video
and I'll see you my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
