Black Friday haul of 2016 is ready
Thanksgiving and now that it's Black
Friday like it's so weird I just like it
snuck up on me so quick actually got all
of this yesterday on Thursday I'm coming
this on Friday I already feel like I'm
so late like uploading this video I said
people have had Black Friday hauls up
since like freaking Halloween that's
what it feels like anyway I actually
went shopping last night on Thanksgiving
meet my friends Taylor and Hannah we
don't sit like 9:30 we went to the mall
and we got backed by like 12:30 1:00 so
we weren't even there that long but I
got a bunch of stuff and I'm so did to
share it all with you guys so the first
place we went to was Lululemon and I
went a little crazy made so much stuff
on sale I was like whoa if you guys know
me you know like I'm come on and if you
don't know me subscribe down below if
you want to see more of my videos
because they are just a great time the
first thing I got or just these black
pants I don't even know the exact prices
of these items with they're all entail
my friend Taylor actually has these
black pants and I've always loved them
so I was like I'm gonna get them I
decided I'm not gonna really make this
halter on because I just want to get it
up really quick for you guys and I
normally do try on ones and either the
street to studio pant to case you're
wondering then I got these other pair of
pants they're just black and white print
and these are that inspired tight to
their 7/8 lengths and they're almost
like full-length on me I'm 5 now and I'm
pretty tall so if you guys are under 5 9
like these types of pants would probably
be like full length on you and I really
like the mesh on the front when they
have little zipper pockets too I didn't
even notice that so these are really
awesome and I literally live in Little
Women leggings like all of mine are
always dirty because I always wear them
so I can always use them they're pair so
I got this tank top
it's that sculpt tank is just all black
it's like high neck mesh on the sides
and I really like the back because it's
open right there in the middle and I got
this sweatshirt which is so cute I'm and
when it first came out my friend Kat was
showing me and I was like I need it and
I'm so happy I got it it's called the
split pullover and you know those
sweatshirts that are kind of like bunchy
right there in the neck like that and
there's just little ties it's just so
comfy and cute to just like throw on oh
I also blogged for Black Friday so I'll
have that link down below too you can
check out my blog channel scratching in
Lucy it's a good time I post somewhere
all the time Vlad misses coming soon I
can't believe it it's so soon anyway
but I got this long-sleeve shirt from 11
is so soft I was like woah I need this
it's called the rush hour long-sleeve
this will be perfect to like throw on
after yoga so I don't get chilly down
you're sweaty and you work out and then
you have to like go home
I walk outside and you're like really
cool because like if you're somebody you
like get cold really easily after you do
not talk down so this will be good throw
on the last thing I got from Lululemon
was the run and done ear warmers shell
and this was on sales with 19 bucks so I
was like okay I need this because I
don't have a little heavy I like this
and I like running outside when it's
cold so this will keep like here's more
then we just ran into Abercrombie and
Fitch I just want to see what they had
and the first thing I got is just this
pair of earrings look nice I want to
wear them to formal like really really
fancy those so I don't know if I'll end
up wearing them they're like super
dangly but I just how they're really
cute and if I don't have wearing them to
formal I mean I'll wear them another
time and I saw this black fella and I
was like yes it's literally exactly the
bralette I've been looking for because I
got do you guys know I showed in a
holiday recently I got this long-sleeve
black mesh body suit from necessary
clothing so you have to wear like a
burlap underneath it and I've been
wanting a black one that's in this shape
that's like lace for a while and it's so
nice is this when I was padding in it
cuz I feel kind of uncomfortable in the
ones fat padding you know well I haven't
even tried it on yet but I would highly
recommend because I think it's super
cute and it looks so big to me like I
don't know why it looks so big but it
was an extra small so maybe they weren't
big I don't really know balls oh I don't
have any boobs so I mean yeah whatever
so then I ran into Victoria's Secret and
the first thing I'll show you I'm
actually wearing right now I got this pj
said guys so exciting like a look at
these they're on just like you know
thermal PJ's and I wasn't even really
planning on getting these but I saw them
and I was like they're so cute what was
annoying was they had extra small or
extra large and I'm like are you serious
like I probably would've gotten like a
small so if you're like looser and more
comfy fitting in stuff but I just got
the extra small look and a fitting and
the pants look like this they're like so
Christmassy and I just love them so I
spent over I don't even know how much it
was maybe 75 80 something like that so I
got this bag I didn't even know that
whoa I forgot that they like do there's
some Black Friday it's like this big
black leather bag and it has this like
pretty cuff as this like tassel of like
all these colors on it I was like that
is wild but it kind of makes sense
because I'm on the inside this is so
cute like I will actually use this it's
like a makeup bag or something it's like
this Victoria's Secret like colorful
like sequined bag and it's like fairly
big and I think that's really nice you
can like throw your makeup in there you
can even use it as a good clutch if you
wanted to the whole reason I plan on
going there is
really needed undies I don't know if I
should show you them because it's kind
of weird but here really quick this is a
thing look like and also I think cuz I
got pajamas she was like you get
slippers too so like what color do you
want and I was like green skew so I got
these fluffy little slippers too so good
deals a Victoria Secret like he's
sitting on my knees I'm so excited he
needs like sit back down okay
from Sephora I was planning on getting
one thing but then I got two things I
knew I wanted the benefit 15 hour
primers stay flawless actually fun fact
I'm pretty sure everyone hates this
primarily finest me like you guys like
one star literally think they like just
continue this for a while because like
everyone hated it but we just love it
it's like very fake like a glue stick
and I actually put on today underneath
my foundation and your makeup literally
doesn't move I mean I guess it feels a
little heavy on your face but like I
don't even notice it and I just love it
so I knew that I wanted to get a new one
because I ran out of mine and then like
I said I was with my friend Hannah and
she uses the Kat Von D bow-and-arrow
like liquid lipstick I think that's what
it's called and there was like this
little sentence she's like gosh well you
should really try it out it has like one
of your favorite eyeliners men shoes so
I was like okay I've used this liquid
eyeliner before too so I already know
that I like it it's just the mini one
and then I got the mini liquid lipstick
in bow-and-arrow like Hanna said is just
this really pretty nude color and I
actually threw it on today wearing fake
eyelashes too if you couldn't tell in
the other day Lucy got these Beats
headphones and I've been obsessed with
them they're like the power beats three
Wireless ones and I was like okay I need
them and she has the white ones and I
just got them in black and Lucy got from
the Apple store so I was planning on
getting them at the Apple store but then
Apple wasn't even open on Thanksgiving
and my head is like Black Friday but I
guess it was too like Thanksgiving
suppose like thanksgiving night you know
so I just got these from Best Buy and
they are the power beats three wireless
headphones and they were on sale at all
like some stores have sales or a lot
doing so that's not even on sale like
love running outside so this is gonna be
so great for that then the last couple
things I didn't actually get like on
Black Friday or like Thanksgiving but
I'm just meaning to show you guys
because I've been getting it in the last
couple days like before Black Friday and
the first thing is this computer this is
the new MacBook Pro I got the 15-inch
Space Gray one and it's the one I don't
know if you can see right there at the
top it has like a little touch bar any
like unlock it with your finger and my
favorite is how it has all the emojis at
the top you can like scroll through them
you see that's like my favorite and then
when you like text evil you can just use
all those emojis up there and there's
like so much you can do with that touch
bar at the top I just think it's really
cool so this is really
and I wanted a MacBook Pro because my
old one actually you can see it right
there it's the purple one underneath my
MacBook Gator but it's like so old it's
like a generation or two old and it just
can't keep up with me and editing my
videos so this is a really good
investment yeah I like it so far the
only thing I have to say is there's no
plugs in the side there's two USB see
one's right there and there's two USB
see ones on this side with the headphone
jack so that's annoying like I have to
get all these adapters for my USB cords
and like getting footage on here to edit
like I think this video is gonna be a
pain but you know this is the future I
just gotta adapt oh and even the next
thing I got so that I actually showed in
my like unboxing my new macbook video my
vlog channel if you want to see more
about that I'll link that down below too
because I talk way more in depth about
that and I also showed in there that day
when I got that my David Yurman ring
came in the mail so this is like
something else that I got recently that
I just want to show in this haul video
because I really really like it my
cousin Mandy had this this is just one
case you're honoring I'm a size 7 and
this is just the green I think it's
called petite some things with an A I
don't know but if you go on their
website you know you'll be able to see
it if you guys know I have the clear
necklace but I didn't want to get the
clear ring because I thought it would
look like an engagement ring so I just
got the light green even though it looks
pretty light and like neutral as well
I'm saw they like fit together so this
is just another recent purchase that I
really like
do you guys know also this past Sunday I
went to New York City and the only stuff
I got from there was from Urban
Outfitters and I think they did have
some sales going on like maybe pre Black
Friday sales so I just thought I would
include these in here as well only got
three things
so the first shirt I got is just this
black shirt it's like off-the-shoulder I
look I've seen this style of shirt a lot
and I just thought it was so cute and
then I just got this shirt it's like
light pink cream and I saw in the
mannequin and I just thought it was so
cute it's like pretty scandalous not
gonna like I'm gonna have to be careful
when I wear it so as you can see it's
like long-sleeve and the whole front is
just open see how it drapes open like
that and then it just ties at the top
look at your neck so you have to be
really careful I'll probably have to
wear like tape on it and like obviously
like sticky boob pads because like old
friends open so you won't build a wear
like a normal bra and last thing I got
from Urban Outfitters is I guess I don't
know if this is a good crop tank top or
like a bra but it's like really soft and
I don't want to wear it but I just
thought it was like really cute and
really comfortable so I got it actually
the very last thing I have to show you
guys is my new bed I came the other day
is great that I got it from Wayfarer and
even haven't had board before this fed
like I don't even know what I was doing
and I ordered it before I came home for
a Thanksgiving break because I was at
school when I was like I don't even like
have a bed at home I can find the links
to these things I'll have them listed
down below sort of lay check that out
check out the blogs I told you that will
be listed down below as well and yeah I
think that is it for my Black Friday
all this here thank you guys so much for
watching and I'll see you my next video
