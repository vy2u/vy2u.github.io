wallet and I really have never lost my
wallet before ever I don't think if any

honestly that when I went to Whole Foods
on Sunday that I put it in my paper like
Whole Foods bag and then I ate the food
that I got out of it
there was sushi and like trail mix in
there and I took it out and ate it and
then I think I left my wallet in there
and threw out the bag so I think it's in
a trash can right now yeah I might be in
the trash but I was really excited for
mommy to come because mommies are good
at finding everything right yeah I like
dug everything out behind my back
there's so much crap back there I looked
through all of it so sad and I like
never carry cash and like all of a
sudden I just randomly had a lot of cash
in there
okay at least I didn't lose like my twin
sister that's more valuable than money
that Lucy that's what I said
the Cayenne today I said Wow times like

is to have a twin sister so that I can
just use her credit cards and she was
like I'll tell Lucy that's why you like
her could you convenient parents are
