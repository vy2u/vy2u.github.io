I only edited like one vlog but it was
fun
the line isn't even that bad - it
usually it's like out the door with all
your salad go
such a nice data
you're full now many other good words of
advice for when you come to sweet grains
what you should get chicken as well so
pretty oh my gosh look at that dog oh my
gosh I miss doggy so much how was your
first sweet green experience it was good
really good
I knew it like yeah look at more
Christmas yeah oh wait question of the
day what was it gonna be oh yeah okay
today's question of the day comes from
Mia who texted me she always texts me
question of the days and she said what
are you most excited for when you come
home besides seeing her I'm really
excited to see her
actually I know what it is seeing my dog
that's what I'm most excited for what
are you most excited for yeah yeah my
family to pretty much just my dog though
and know and my friends yeah I want to
see that
so exciting
so everyone ones the last time I've
logged maybe a sweet green or like
leaving sweet green yeah so the library
today was super fun and I'm really happy
I went cuz I've always wanted to go Lucy
you still haven't gone yet right library
yeah I know it was it was like really
cool that one pretty it was like really
pretty
we got yelled at for talking though now
Lucy and I are going to work out and it
is like six o'clock already I can't
believe how late it's gone yeah he did
Tashia really did like sweet green um he
at first he didn't want to go he wanted
he said he wanted real food um but he
really did lucky but he put avocado and
chicken in the one that I always get the
hummus one and he said it was actually
really good in that everyone should get
that but yeah so we're finally going to
workout now even though it's late but
it's really nice here because the gym at
BU is open I think into like midnight oh
10 oh it's how did opens like midnight
anyway six to ten okay we have time then
I'll stage like nine I actually have to
work out so much though anyway so I
finally put up the vlog my set was
supposed to go up yesterday and it with
me literally four hours to edit it
because it was 25 minutes long and it
started off at like 43 minutes and then
right now is uploading the vlog that's
supposed to go up today so I'm getting
back on track yay and that one just like
shorter and then you ran through puddles
I'm sorry
oh yeah member how I did the tank here
the other day Lucy did it today except
she's faster than me so I think it was
probably easier if you and them cook you
bastard what was your heart rate like
oh you didn't come back here until after
by Anna do you want to say hi because
they always are like where's Lucy's
roommate new shoes she was one vlogmas
before I think you were in one was I
yeah like Taylor filmed you or something
I wasn't even though yeah yeah Anna
isn't kept with me pray for us wait did
you see the lab exam grades went up I
did so well I didn't even study I looked
at it I looked at it and I said okay I
looked at it and it said 52 and I was
like holy I was like oh my god gosh and
I'm like I can't believe you out of 52 I
was like you suck like you didn't study
I guess you deserve it and I click on it
and set out of sixty I was like I
couldn't believe how well I did I don't
know what she got I didn't ask for yet I
could not believe it
Anna I think that honestly I'm not
kidding I think they like switch papers
like they must have graded someone
else's and thought it was mine I'm not
kidding yeah I like know I feel like I
didn't even know it
Lizzie member we're convinced oh my gosh
guys okay ninth grade wasn't it in ninth
grade Lucy and I were convinced that our
history teacher switched our midterm I
wrote all about how the Nile River
affected Mesopotamia but then I however
isn't Egypt and so I ended up getting
like a ninety and I was like what the
heck like how did I do so well and Lucy
must've gotten like an 85 or something
we were convinced we were like okay like
we're twins
we're in the same class that you
probably mixed our papers she's like no
Gretchen just did really well on the
multiple choice so like I even doubt
even though her essay didn't make any
sense but basically I just get really
lucky on exams and I think I'm just like
a good test taker or any of you like
that or you're just like good at taking
tests cuz I just feel like I'm a good
test taker I don't to say I'm good at
guessing but I just feel like I'm good
at like yeah I'm gonna guess I'm just
sometimes I just look at a question I'm
like okay like it's clear what the right
answer is like I don't even I don't even
know the material but like I know this
is a right answer you know like it just
seems like it's written like the right
answer sometimes
wrong answers are written a certain way
you know what I mean like this isn't
right anyway we're gonna work out now
and let's check in with you later
oh you're doing oh look guys these are
the running shorts I showed them the
other day
or no it was in the flounder set when
I'm today logged is day 13 I was like
good morning I put on running short so
that I would run but I didn't actually
end up running and I'm wearing those
running shorts and I'm gonna run so yeah
Oh some people are commenting on the
track inside the track inside is better
than them oh yeah oh my gosh we always
we always trip I don't know why the
track is like sticky here so my feet
like they literally get stuck on the
track and I tripped I might try biking
um
some of you were saying that a video
about like motivation for running and
like um how to start off running and
just like tips I think would be a good
idea so maybe I'll do that that seems
kind of interesting and I'll just give
you my words of advice also I showed
this earlier we went to CVS on the way
to the library to get gone and I saw
this and it's like the new purple iOS
and I had the purple one but this one I
have like cool lines on it I think it's
actually blackberry it said I just
wanted to let you guys know that it
smells really good I like it
Anna did you know I've every color of
EOS I cos Abby's lip balm I used to be
obsessed I really like a limited edition
like collections would come out and I
get mom we're going to target I was like
obsessed and I have like a drawer full
of that I've been balling a purse on
right now okay
bye everyone Katie and I are just here
we're doing some work right now show
everyone I just got back
I'm so tired let me show you when I
watch this like how crazy is that I know
it was for like a really long time like
three hours so my heart rate wasn't even
that high but I'm just like pooped
morning so today I'd like to even though
I seriously hate biking I don't know why
I just like hate it and then I did some
weight so I biked for 40 minutes and
wait for 30 minutes and then ran for 70
and then core for 10 so and I just found
this little gem in my fridge this Zico
coconut water and it would always do is
good for so long so I'm so happy they
still had it like the best thing ever I
favor cap well usually I just will drink
trump on that look at the dining hall
this is like really
Oh does that say November lol people
told me to change it a while ago I never
did sorry
yeah it is clean I actually didn't
notice that cuz we'll see when to sit on
the chair and I was like oh my gosh you
did clean a coma kya this was the new
tank top I shown in my Black Friday haul
and this is literally what got me
through the rest of my workout was
knowing that like half of this salad was
in my fridge from sweet green earlier
I'm so happy yeah there is and I'm so
thirsty because this thing I felt so
weird bringing this to the gym like I
felt like a knife let 'ok person because
it's like a tongue yeah because it's
literally like a cup I just didn't feel
like hunting for my water bottles and
it's smaller than like a Nalgene so I
like ran out of water but I couldn't go
fill it up while I was working out you
wanna get at 6:45 tomorrow I will I'm
gonna run with you in the morning so
whenever you get up get me okay why not
