and like read to little kids and it was
so fun like they were literally so cute
was just like a really fun morning like
got me in the Christmas spirit and like
I don't know a little kids are just so
cute like it just makes me realize like
I feel I could be so fun to work with
kids and just like work with them
everyday like they probably put you in
the best mood and just make you so happy
so maybe I'll keep that in mind maybe my
career will have to do something with
kids okay granted it probably is like a
lot of work to just working with like
little kids every day and you have to be
very patient and everything but I don't
know it just got me thinking like little
kids are so cute like I'm talking so
fast right now sorry I just yeah
my plan for today is to napple day kind
of like yesterday because I'm so tired
and I did not get enough sleep nearly
enough sleep last night and then I have
some other fun plans tonight and I just
wanted to show you guys I just got this
package and it's so cute so these face
masks like you've probably heard of them
they're called nug beauty they sell them
at like Ulta I know my roommate was
telling me she loves them and I've only
tried out one so far and it was good I
was like a little hesitant about it
because it was like an exfoliating one
and it wasn't like my favorite however
she said like these ones are her
favorite like they have other like
creamy ones so I gotta like try more and
yeah it's just called like nug Beauty
like face masks and I sent me this
little package look how cute with some
face masks and these M&amp;amp;Ms throat these
custom M&amp;amp;Ms and I said beauty and
kindness and stuff like how cute and
like beauty for me like I'm glv like
come on guys so I just think that's so
cute and for all the people at
if you're watching this thank you I love
them I can't wait to try them out like
look how cute this is guys I just need
to show adorable don't even look at my
nails right now I need to paint my nails
but yeah seriously
thank you so much I wasn't even
expecting that little gift and there's a
kilo no the nug team is so sweet
and yeah I'll just have like their
website look down below so you can check
out their face mask hey do you want to
do it I wore today guys like I guess
what I'm still wearing and you guys want
me to do more after the weeks or I swear
I have some coming up I have like a
bunch of its own I just have to like put
the video together but it's kind of hard
to edit um all these videos when I'm
like what's going on - so sorry I swear
I do have normal videos coming up - um
I'm just wearing this black vest from
Abercrombie I wear this like Woodley
every day and you guys always ask where
it's from
I got on my Friday it's from our comedy
I'm just wearing this red Nike like
quarter zip I'm wearing some jeans
Herbal I guess I think they're geng's
technically from American Eagle but they
kind of just feel like normal jeans to
me and then these brown bean boots and I
think you guys were asking me - like are
those from LL Bean yes like the normal
ones but they're um just chocolate brown
because I felt like getting a different
pair than everyone else because everyone
has like the tan ones you know I'm gonna
take a nap and I'll see you guys later
it might be really late cuz I feel
coming to sleep all day
so everyone it's 5:15 I slept all day
and now I'm going to make gingerbread
houses with some people which should be
fun I don't even have my camera with me
though cuz I just want to like live in
the moment you know but maybe I'll
insert some pictures if we take pictures
of them right here if yeah those are
some gingerbread houses I just had a
nice restful day I'm happy I got to
sleep during the day because I was
really really tired and I just straight
my hair some more and I'm barb Mekhi
sweatshirt because it's Christmassy and
it has all these little snowmen and I
think it's so cute kind of hungry since
I just ate breakfast and now it's 5:15
maybe I'll get some cereal and not spill
it all over like the other day oh no our
milk I think we might have yogurt that
was one of my idea with that we're kind
of scared our milk has gone bad so
probably won't need that drink that
whatever guys I found some socks to
really kill the outfit they're just red
and green ones I still don't really feel
in the Christmas spirit
Oh guys I didn't tell you tomorrow me
and macaé and Lucy and Taylor I don't
know if anyone else but we're planning
I'm going to the Nutcracker so I'm so
excited because it'll just be really fun
to go see it and go to like the Boston
Opera House and I didn't run you like
dinner before and to be so fun and that
will put me in the Christmas spirit so
yes I'm excited for that this is the
best thing ever if you haven't tried
this yogurt you have to because it's
like the Chobani one except like it's
still Greek and I just eat your body but
this one tastes so much yummier cuz
there honestly there's probably more
sugar in it or something let's see
there's 11 grams of sugar I don't know
if that's a lot but anyways it tastes
better than Giovanni one don't look at
my girls nail-polish sorry I'm too lazy
to paint them okay guys there's two
things I want to mention so one thing is
my friend don't marry texted me the
other day and was like hope you're
recording so you can see this and
mention me in your next vlogmas post and
actually did record it but I ended up
having to like cut out that part um
anyways so hey oh me
our what's up and I know you wanted to
be in vlogmas so i hope you're having a
great time in college also the next
thing i wanted to mention is i put up
like dating the life of lifeguards video
yesterday and it's just like lucy me and
our friend Julia for over the summer and
I thought I mentioned in the video that
no one was at the pool there's no one
there no one was in danger I promise
like when people are there we did do our
job I read a million comments of people
like fighting about it and I know people
know how to life guard differently and
people have been trained differently but
just at our privately-owned pools we
were allowed to do that when no one was
there the rules did change about the
summer got a little bit more stricter I
don't know if that um justifies any of
it like I apologize if you were offended
in the way that we were acting a lot of
you said I was very unprofessional I
didn't mean for it to come off like that
at all I don't know that's just like
kind of how the summer went and that's
how we were allowed to act when no one
was there so I just thought it would be
if I can share that with you and I
wanted to be able remember how much fun
I had with my Julia and Lucy over the
summer so I'm really sorry I felt like
offended you at all like when people
were there at the pool we would
lifeguard we would do our duties the
reason you're allowed to do that is
because we already clean the bathrooms
we already checked the chemicals every
hour like we were supposed to like
everything was the way it was supposed
to be so that's why we were allowed to
like read books or talk to each other
talk on the phone like we were allowed
to because no one was there so that's
just how our boss had it um again like
if you were trained differently if you
had to stare at the pool even if no one
was there I actually did work at a pool
like that like at the YMCA if no one was
there we still had to sit out there we
couldn't really do anything so like it
just is different different places and I
don't want any of you to be mad at me
for that I have been lifeguarding for
like four years now and I take it very
seriously so I just wanted to like make
that statement I don't want any mean
comments about this that's just how it
was it made me really upset to see that
everyone was so angry about it
Wow alright bye guys I just got back and
I were you looking ready for bed yeah I
feel like tired again even though I
slept all day I think he's like I'm like
throwing off my sleep schedule so I'm
just like always tired now but no I'm
you like get one so yeah make some
gingerbread house is really fun and ours
was really good I can't wait to go home
and like less than a week I'm
so excited I miss my dog I miss my
parents
hey it's cute
everyone loves you Taylor all the
comments were so sweet about you I know
it so cute

the most because I'm with her all the
time and I film her sometimes so yeah
