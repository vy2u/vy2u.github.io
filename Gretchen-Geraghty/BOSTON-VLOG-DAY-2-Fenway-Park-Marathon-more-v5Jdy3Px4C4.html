realize because I don't think I really
made a big like talking intro or
anything I was in Boston for the past
two days we left Sunday morning early
and just came back tonight which is like
late Monday night and yeah it was super
fun I just met with Justin and his
family because we wanted to go to Boston
for like Patriots Day but I guess in
Boston they call it Marathon Monday so
yeah if you follow me on instagram you
would see those posts also and Twitter
too but anyway I went to a Red Sox game
today and yesterday and today we like
walked around and went to like the
finish line at the Boston Marathon I got
like a shirt that says like the Boston
Marathon to you I really liked it and
today we actually watched like the
runners go by and like cheering them on
he saw the footage for that and it was
just so awesome being able to see all
the people running a marathon and
honestly it was like inspiring not to
get like deep or anything but it was
really cool seeing everyone run the
marathon especially when it was freezing
cold and rainy so yeah I had a lot of
fun these past few days and sorry my
vlogging was like kind of limited I was
literally just taping Justin because I
felt like uncomfortable just like
talking to the camera like this like
when we were in public places and such
and I don't even know if I like
mentioned it but we were with Justin's
mom house and Justin's dad Michael and
Jaclyn Justin's sister so anyway yeah it
was a lot of fun and I'm so happy I was
able to go with them and I thought it
would just be fun to vlogs and footage
and take you guys along and I want you
to know too I know Justin has been in a
lot of my vlogs and like pretty much
only like one video like boyfriend tag
but he like doesn't like being filmed
that much so I promise he likes me we
like each other and if he seems like not
too happy in vlogs it's because he gets
annoyed and I'm vlogging all the time
and he says I go like this in his face
I try to like oh he's film him so yeah
and I don't really only do that cuz I
know you guys like seeing him and I like
when he's in my blogs because I think
it's funny and he's fun to film but he
does
like you that much today was Justin's
eighteenth birthday - so I'm really
happy I was able to like be with him for
his birthday
I just wanted to throw this in here to
conclude at this vlog I hope you enjoyed
and now I feel girls cuz we literally
were sitting outside at the baseball
game all day like in the rain and it got
really rainy and I just feel like gross
but yeah and this is my sweatshirt that
I showed in that haul video and it is
coming in super handy because I've
literally been wearing it all weekend
and I have to do homework and go to
school tomorrow school guys I hate it
okay I'm gonna go thank you so much for
watching I love you so so much and I
will see you my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
