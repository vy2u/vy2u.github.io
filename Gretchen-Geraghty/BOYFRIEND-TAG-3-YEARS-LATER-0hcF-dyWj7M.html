two truths in a live video I don't even
know if that's really like a video that
people do almost like I'm Teddy Boy okay
we're just gonna see like who knows each
other better I guess but each have five
questions TV two three years ago when we
set this GameSpot into the boyfriend tag
first one I was born two and a half
months premature before my parents knew
the gender of their twins they thought I
was a girl unless you as a boy if Lucy
and my names weren't Lucy and Gretchen
they'd be Madeleine and Heather what's
your third one no ROM it was a second
before my parents did the gender they're
trans I thought I was a girl Missy was
boy they thought I was a boy and Lucy
was a girl I've told you that so many
times you just switch them yeah that's
you specific said not to do things like
that
oh it's not that word because I told you
so many times I thought oh you me boy
because my heartbeat was bad she's my
question someone harder no no you're not
no Justin what was my aim gonna be if I
was a boy I've told you this before no
clue yeah you get a drama ever loses has
to penny Pretender had a bunny I've had
chicks and I've had a goldfish oh my mm

she looks real when I was little I was
obsessed with drawing sea horses when I
was little I would kind of do everything
you were little it's that much too
football and I know you that's not the
point we gained when I was little I
would cry every day because I didn't
want to be separated from Lucy and when
I was little I'd wear heels and makeup
all the time and pretend to be older cuz
I couldn't wait to grow up like forever
wearing heels to basketball practice and
the tongue is now I know it's the truth
it was a second one he goes yeah when I
was a little comedy because I know we
said we're different Lucy I was with
Lucy I was separated for my parents keep

things like that listen to the answers
and you'll realize like obviously
Gretchen was cool to see like avi I
wasn't as withdrawing to yours is that

make sure the questions aren't like
exactly what you're done like
specifically exactly make it easier

heels too as well practice with my
teacher in shorts and I'll change in the
sneakers there because I wanted people
