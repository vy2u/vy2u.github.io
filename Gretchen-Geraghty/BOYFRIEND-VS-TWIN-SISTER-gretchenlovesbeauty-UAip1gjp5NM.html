before those I did what our whole time i

right so now it's five five okay this is
a really hard one
what was my name on YouTube for two days
before I made the name of my channel
Gretchen loves beauty it's a weird name
I've told you both number and bonus is
why was it that name this car smells
beauty channel right here was indeed a
different name for two days I've never
any subscribers on anything I was a
weirdo freshman year there's your hands
and I would make weird videos and put
them on the internet I did for two days
and then I decided to make a beauty
video and so I changed the name
Christian loves PD
they're just like Essen I have no idea
okay
Justin doesn't get a point and um Lucy's
really close I'll give you the point
because it's right Lucy says Lisa loves
gumballs is called Lisa gumballs because
we made a weird video with Lisa and
Hanna and Tammy dancing correct made
some dancing videos by myself and I
posted them on there like a couple for
like two days and I change it to
Gretchen competing this channel name was
Lisa dumped also him first
my daddio you ever made wasn't yeah I'm
a computer know those got deleted before
my channels Rachel Oh sweetie so now
it's Nick's time
what is our nickname for a coach that I
love nineties really Jessica's Toto Nia
huh do you picture me 276 when I used to
swim what was my event I told you
gustatory Lucy says I am Justin sighs
freestyles correct I am is all of them
five uh frustrating hello basking
breaths person ID Italia so nitrogen on
him that's just the type of the race how
did my kitty George died he said stroke
while you were away and was he says
stroke both correct so Lucy is up to
right now
we're going to do two more so justin has
a chance to catch up have I do you want
your fish
I doesn't matter how bad I wanted was
evil man yeah this should be easy for
you an eleventh grade when we started
dating
what was my favorite shirt that you
would wear how a kind of question
because I told you I told you if I
remember in lab class I would stare at a
time such a grieve and to me start
dating yet I think I was at the very
beginning of you when we did George in
here even when we did he sat in the
front and I sat in the back and I would
look at you and I'm like always so cute
I told you about it and you have to know
and if you don't want to be really sad
because I've talked about a lot more
it was good dark green polo dark repose
I guess I must say like a like a soccer
shirt oh you're both right oh I'm proud
we I don't want to be like you can't
even win the house is your's only one
question off and think of another
question to the last question okay
maybe we'll do two more then this is
harder to vote we put if we just end it
now any losses yeah I've had two
questions left absolutely if you get my
next two right they could still be here
you know
stop watching soccer I'm looking for
these last two questions I have are at
what ages did I so they're gonna be hard
and you're probably booked enough to
guess at what age do I always get
nightmares constantly and I would cry
and go to sleep with my parents like
every night look I was always afraid of
nightmares and thinking out them and I'd
get them all the time against just gets
killed first
I remember them like launching my life
like every time I would be scared to go
to sleep because I knew I would have a
nightmare and I was so scared you
Beaufort 11 and you're both wrong it was
10 you were so close Joel oh yeah
the last question is after this is Zoe
Foreman at what age did I always think
of and was like extremely afraid of
dying like I would think of death
constantly and I was so scared of it I
wake up in the morning I remember I'd
wake up and I would be like dear God
like I really hope I don't die today I
don't know I was just so scared of dying
because I guess I just would like
weirdly obsess over and like think about
all the time and I was just so scared of
death but then I guess you kind of just
hit a point where you're like okay it's
just like a part of life get happened
you can't just worry about I just have
to live your life how it is review sense
or teacher you know cuz I just injury
this number 11 you're right you it was
14 kiss for a second I just kept
thinking was freshman year in freshman
year I was 14 tore you down one yeah oh
I'm really sorry
I want you both to win cuz I like both
of you oh I'm sorry I guess let's see
what is more than you wait is more I
would say you both know me pretty well
because some of you got right and you I
don't know that right those are a home
birthmark thing right
wait position a little II I was trying
to lead a bleep little right but I'm
knowing you
so I guess lose me knows me a tiny
teensy bit more than Justin but you
still got a lot right don't think I hate
you and Congrats
