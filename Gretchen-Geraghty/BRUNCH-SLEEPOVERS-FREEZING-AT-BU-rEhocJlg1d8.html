so cute looking literally packed to like
we waited okay we made it like literally
three minutes like we didn't wait at all

about to run a Sephora we're gonna get
venti beauty I've been really wanting
Fendi beauty because all my friends have
it and I didn't have it so I was jealous

buy like a million dollar face serum but
she might get a sample first if she's
feeling reasonable I took a lot of
photos I was having a Breakfast Club and
people are staring at us cuz it was

be basic Park is so fun to just explore
around
I remember spring of freshman year and I
literally was so sad all the time

target like in Fenway and then all the
way back so I don't know I just felt
like it's been a productive morning and
