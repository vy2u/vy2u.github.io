10:30 right now I just got back from it
I just got back from a doctor's
appointment and now I'm toasting some
toasted alcoholic toast yummy so yummy
and I may or may not be buying a car
today I really want to my parents aren't
really sold and then that mean my mom
looked at yesterday
um but stay tuned what you just made the
race the dry erase marker what are you
doing boy
he get so excited when he sees this in
the morning
here's my toast toasting my avocado
Lizzy didn't do any of her dishes room
today oh my gosh Lonnie breakfast with
me okay thank you yes I'll feed you in
one sec yeah I just put my avocado on my
toast and I'm gonna add some pepper
do-do-do-do-do and then some salt this
is really hard to do with one hand I
think yeah first I have to take penny
out so he doesn't I'm eating my avocado
toast oh look at that's when we were
seniors
hey guys I'm freaking out right now oh
my gosh this is like really surreal this
would be my last time in this old car
because I just bought a new one well not
new ok because I was answering some
questions yesterday you don't let me
start the car right now because and yeah
so I just want to answer some things
that I saw in the comments because I
posted a vlog yesterday of of me like
looking for cars or I was saying that I
was looking for them and I was really
sad cuz - the ones that I wanted like so
low I mean it was just one at that point
and then yesterday was gonna go look at
one in Saratoga and I called me she's
like yeah that's available let me just
go like check and make sure and she came
back she said oh no it's all they just
sold you know I was like so sad so then
the BMW dealership here like look here
here right now and I would show you mine
but it's like in the shop and yeah so
I'm like sitting out front right now and
me and my mom we're just in there for so
long but wait I was saying something oh
yeah so the BMW dealership here
yesterday kept calling me and being like
just like updating me on like a new
inventory that they had cuz it's like
always changing and being like oh do you
want this one do you want this one and I
was like I'm sorry I'm really picky but
you guys saw in my comments and I loved
like how supportive you guys were
because I know I was saying how nervous
I was to like talk about it but everyone
was like obviously like you do you it's
like your money and like you should be
picky I saw one comment it was so funny
and they were like you're not gonna like
settle it was something like you're not
gonna like settle on someone that you
would marry so why would you settle I'm
like a car or like I don't know it was
something like that which is like so
true so they kept calling me and being
like oh I found that you like kind of
like the colors are different and I'm
like like I'm a picky and I really just
wanted the white exterior with like the
beige interior and then they called me
back later it was probably 6:30 or 7:00
and they're like oh my gosh we found
like exactly what you wanted was like
the white exterior the tan interior the
x3 like the moonroof like all the extra
things that I wanted he's like the only
thing is it was 2015 and I wanted like
2016 2017 2018 like probably not to me
aging because I knew I wanted to use one
oh and that's what I don't know if I
made it clear
but in the comments on my videos people
were like oh my gosh don't buy a new one
obviously I know cars are like literally
the worst investments ever like they're
not a good investment like they
depreciate so freakin quickly and you're
not gonna make money on a car ever you
know what I'm saying
but it's just like a purchase that is
like necessary in one's life and yeah so
obviously I knew I wanted to buy and use
because I was like let's be practical
here and even though it's 2015 I test
drove it and I was like I love this
little guy and I don't want to wait any
longer to find one that comes up that's
like more what I want do you know what I
mean because it had everything else I
wanted I'm like who cares if it's like
2015 versus 2017 you know so yeah I just
bought a car this is like a really
surreal because I just like signed the
dotted line my hand was shaking I know
him so nervous it's gonna be the worst
day ever
and then we literally sat there for so
long we were on the phone with our
insurance for like an hour trying to
like strain everything out because like
you have to have insurance when you buy
a car and I'm just so thankful to my mom
when you're watching this I love you
thank you for being there with me
because like I wouldn't been able to
figure that out you know what I mean
like it was like I was using like my
parent's insurance and I had to be like
removed from their policy like all this
stuff so yeah thank you mom for just
being everything because like so many
questions she was asking me I didn't
know the answer to and Nick who helped
me thank you because he was helping the
answer questions that I didn't know the
answers to and I'm just freaking out I
can't believe I bought a car but right
now they're just like tuning it out
normally my parents were like so
surprised that I could like pick it up
today because I'm literally gonna come
back in like an hour and a half and
scoop it and bring it home because
they're like normally you buy a car and
you pick it up like the day after the
day after that because I have to be
license plates and you gotta be intern
straight not everything but I was like I
want to drive back to Boston like
tonight if I can I like tomorrow morning
so can I pick it up like tonight and he
was like yeah we're gonna like get it
done as quick as we can so that is the
plan ah I like can't believe it
thank you all for being so understanding
and just know that like this is a very
like I don't know like fun experience
and like big like milestone in my life
like buy my first car and again I don't
want any hate because I feel like I did
it in a very like smart practical way
like I'm not just like blah
like obviously I saved a bunch of money
at being like using everything so yeah
I'm really excited um maybe Hannah will
come back with me later to grab it
because I want someone to like come with
me so that I can like drive it back you
know I don't want to have like a million
cars like stuck here um but yeah I'm
like starving because it's like three
right now we got there like 12:30 so
maybe I'll go home and eat and wait for
Nick to call me and then come back and
get it I could show I want to know what
I should name it because she needs a
name maybe I'll post my Instagram story
and be like help like see at me like
what names you think they should have oh
my god I've been talking for five
minutes but so now I am home and I'm
eating Lucy's leftover chipotle bowl and
lookit there's like the whole thing left

just like everything in like her back

he's like in the video like promoting
BMW and he's like the one that gets most
likes like wings and I'm like oh my god
I wanted to go watch it because he can't
be in the ball because he's so camera
shy so this should be really funny um

mostly for the frosting you're gonna
attain his mysterious presence these are
gonna be in the blog but just know that
he exists and that's his little desk
right there I'm looking he's drawing a
mere BMW we are not hydrated but we are

earlier and it was really cool okay I
very few up battery left

it is guys freak it out he just showed
me like everything like all what it
means and I'm like I'm saying I know we
are already living our best like sushi
was good yeah this is gonna die I love
no it's the next morning and literally
it was the worst time for my camera
battery yet to die last night because I
was trying to show you guys our new car
but um I figured I could just show you
now really quick like I said I just I
just barely got up there was a bug but
it's like next morning is just like it
cloudy here in Albany and me and Hannah
are gonna drive back to Boston today and
if I can find parking and time in Boston
like long-term for at least this summer
then my car will stay there and if not
Hannah will have to drive it back home
so I can figure out my parking situation
so ya want to see more okay this is what
the front looks like that's like my
license plate so yeah I just think
you're not at least was sure that my
keys my phone and then wait did I market
I think it's unlocked dings I didn't
think okay and then that's the inside I
know I kind of showed it last night but
I just wanted to like show you more
since this vlog is supposed to be about
my new car and then we actually let's
see
right now and then you go like this just
started things out you oh baby okay okay
hey because my sleeper I wonder if my
phone cuz my phone's on the outside of
the car wait I'm gonna show you what
happens I'm gonna get it and maybe
actually it's because it's on after
wait yeah okay it is playing my music I
think this is so new to me I know what
I'm doing
this is so surreal and this is my car I
don't believe it I'm gonna get a little
car mount so he can do like drive with
me oh yeah this is my music this is the
plan I was playing earlier hey so we are
guys because I mean the car that listen
you know driving or used to driving was
so old that it literally didn't have a
CD player like it didn't um Shh calm
down it didn't have like anybody could
plug in your phone or anything and then
I'll show you it down in here it has
this little what's it called what's that
called USB and then this is just like
one of those one of those car plug-in
things and they have two little USB
things I think the previous owner of the
car actually left it there they said so
thanks boo because now I have two other
USB ports and I'm bringing oh I didn't
bring it down but I wanted to I have
another USB cord I want to bring in
there so that when I Drive people they
can charge their phone and I can charge
my phone but I was really trippy
yesterday I started freaking out I was
like how does he know because my phone
was like plugged in to this thing and I
thought that that's how I was playing
the music but it's connected through
bluetooth as well so I up I unplug my
phone into music you playing and I was
like wait why using something so it's
just like very high-tech for me this is
also new since the car I was used to
driving before it was so different this
is what the front part looks like it has
44,000 miles which is more than I wanted
I think I already talked about this
though so I don't want to bore you it's
more that I initially wanted because I
wanted like 20,000 but honestly I
noticed no difference and I love this
car and I just like really wanted one
ASAP so that's what we did oh and then
this morning actually when I was driving
home so I end up sleeping over at
Hannah's last night I was gonna drive
home last night to my parents to see the
car but I stopped by Hannah's after we
got sushi you probably saw two seconds
of it but it was so good we went to 90 I
said you nje but i think it was called
UNH it was so good and then I went to
Hannah's and we are watching black in
the air we watched an episode of two and
I like don't watch that show I've never
seen it look on my own I only watch it
if I'm with Hannah and it just like
makes me think so much and like makes me
go crazy like my head is like spinning
when I watch that show I'm just like
whoa so probably like all of you like
watch it or a bunch of you and are like
I don't know used to it but when I watch
it like messes me up I feel like I'm not
like on planet Earth I feel like I'm
somewhere else
I don't know I'm sounding weird I know
but it was just creeping me out and then
I was so tired then I end up just
sleeping I Hannah's literally in the
clothes I was wearing because I was so
dead like I was like why am I so tired
but I think just like being at the car
dealership all day like dealing with
insurance like talking like money just
like so much stuff like being like
really engaged all day I'm just like
really tired me out
um but yeah oh we always showing you at
the front of it looks like so it's that
I'm like very close to this steering
well does anyone else it's super close
like I sit like my see I don't know if
you can tell it's very like up right and
like I'm very close to the steering
wheel but I always like sit like that
when I Drive and then it's like that oh
and then I has your contacts and this
little thing is so cool like probably
probably a bunch of you have BMWs your
parents something it's ready no but this
was just like so new for me and you have
like multimedia radiotelephone nav the
nav is something that like I don't know
I'll use because like I have my phone
you know telephone that's cool
earlier I called and I was like call
daddy and it like knew like that's so
cool but like I feel like I'm being so
like weird i down probably but to be
real like I'm used to this but this is
just so new to me okay bear with me here
I'm old-fashioned
and then the moonroof is like literally
when I wanted so bad you just go like
this
do you think okay like that I think I'm
always gonna drive it and lose
everything because I qui not got a
sunroof whatever you call it I love it
and then you got your back DDT and all
the way in the back of the trunk um I
like that there's like a cover that goes
over the tops of here like a bunch of
luggage or something like you can just
cover it and people won't see it I don't
know so I think about that I'm scared
I'm in a park though
and leave the moonroof open and then
people can just reach their hands and
they're like jumping through the top so
I gotta remember to close it when I like
park what else is cool oh all the seats
are heated which i think is so sick
because looking cars that I've been in
the have heated seats like I think I
know my dad's guys he did tease I don't
think my mom's does but um it's just the
front seats oh wait no my dad says the
back seats too well I don't know I think
a lot of cars I vented it's only
different seat so I think it's really
cool that all seats are heated and the
steering wheels you did too
I'll show you he was showing me
yesterday it's that tiny little button
okay so I did motors go there we go
he needs click it mid orange and then
your steering wheel is heated so that's
really cool but yeah that's like pretty
much it so far
maybe um some people are ready to having
me I was asking me for like car names to
DM and like right now I would say in the
lead is probably Coco
Bianca whoever said Bianca that's just
like a really I don't know like sassy
name so I love that so many people were
saying pearl like literally everyone
said pearl or like snowflake which I
don't think I'm gonna do that but like
how do you could see why you would say
that cause the cars white and yeah I
would say in the leader and I was
probably Bianca and Coco but if you have
any more like really good names comment
and down below because I just not
decided yet and I have to decide soon
and OH
some of you are damn I mean we're like
please do a car to it when you have like
all this stuff you're gonna have in your
car in your car which comment down below
if you want that too because I don't
know
if I would do that but maybe I would if
you really wanted it and actually might
be interesting cuz I remember I went in
Emma's car she liked this whole middle
thing was just filled with packs of gum
and I was like why why do you have that
much gum like when's anyone need that
much gum but that might just be funny to
see like what I have in my car because
you never know what people are gonna
have in their car I guess oh wait also
before we end off this vlog I want to
show you something really cool about the
trunk actually I don't know I'm gonna
open it like right there you can open it
like that and then it'll open but
yesterday but he was showing me what I
thought was so cool here that's what the
back looks like he's like when you have
like if you're like your arms are folded
like a bunch of groceries or like
whatever it may be and you like don't
have hands to touch that little button
he's like there's this feature built-in
where you just like kick like that and
then it will close come on I did it
earlier maybe because the cars on oh my
god am I like not doing it right
okay well this was supposed to be really
cool with me doing this okay I still
can't get it to work any bad but I swear
earlier I did and it was really cool or
I thought it was cool because I just
didn't think oh this is the thing I was
showing you that like covers stuff in
the back okay this car ball gets
probably been so long now oh wait I want
to show you kind of yeah you just click
the spine since I can't figure it out I
want to show you like what the back of
the car looks like - okay that's what it
looks like oh yeah I just got the x3 I
don't know if I made that clear
when I went to Keeler um I'm like I said
earlier in the vlog definitely go to
Nick because he was the best oh well so
I'm five nine so if this is like
reference for like how tall it is it's
like almost as tall as me and I just
felt like the x1 was like way too little
and I wouldn't be able to like fit
myself in life in there oh my gosh for a
second I thought I thought I locked my
keys in my car but the driver doors
still open
I am so new to having a car because this
is the first car but but oh yeah what I
was gonna say is I know I said it
earlier but
if you are looking for BMW or I think
they have like other cars there too but
it's like the Keeler BMW dealer in
Albany I think it's like over in Latham
definitely go see Nick because he was
the best and they were just like super
helpful and explained so many things to
me like literally yesterday right it is
like all the paperwork in a deterrent
and like money and stuff was done and he
like handed me my keys we like went out
into the car and he explained like
everything to me for so long and I was
asking a million questions I'm like wait
this turn signal wait like what is his
buttons like be heated doing what like I
just didn't know it so many things were
so thank you Nick for explaining
everything to me and yeah so far I would
really recommend this car and my parents
were like reading reviews and stuff on
it because they obviously want to make
sure I was sitting like I say car that
wouldn't like break down everyday and
stuff and I was looking at the Range
Rover Evoque because it's like the it's
like a size that's similar to the X 3
but Range Rovers I feel like break all
the time and such so anyway so far I
love this car I recommend and yeah I
hope you guys enjoyed this little vlog
give me by in my first car and I love
you so much and I'll see you actually in
like one second when I start today's
well like so high okay guys I'm back and
I'm on my phone sorry but my memory
cards just like upstairs and I just have
to show you right now before I tell you
tomorrow ok it's my thing day she was
before that I was actually kicking it
and you really just have to go like that
oh and then you go like this
you literally just like put your foot
underneath in miniconjou see I swear I
