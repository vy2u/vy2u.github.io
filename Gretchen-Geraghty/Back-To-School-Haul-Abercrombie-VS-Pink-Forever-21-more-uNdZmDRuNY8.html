pink and then I saw this one shirt and I
was like wait I need this in my life mmm
because it says snooze before dudes and
come on girl power like everyone needs
this yeah and it was only twenty two
which I Felix go to put pink because I
feel like normally if our self is like
really overpriced so Gretchen got like a
matching one except hers is like rabid
says who needs sleep
I got rainbow flip-flops from PacSun and
I didn't really know I wanted them but
then I just got them and they're the
darker color ones with thin straps and I
have really big feet so these look huge
yeah from PacSun I got this really cute
shirt and you guys will probably be able
to tell I like like bohemian style stuff
like I got like a lot of like things
with prints and like just like crazy
stuff but I got this kind of like crop
top with like ladies it's like bright
orange and then yeah I got real
flip-flops too and I wanted these for so
long they're just the tan ones they're
like the thicker strap ones those you
got the thinner strap ones in chairs
from pax when I actually got mine from
journeys cuz they had them back some
didn't but yeah they're just like sand
is the color I think and I got a large
in case you're my size foot which is
like an 8 and they fit perfect available
I'm like a six and a half seven I have
them in a small so oh yeah yeah yeah I
got a dress from Urban Outfitters what's
like ribbed yeah it's like well I really
liked it and it was a good place so I
just got it yeah I'm from Francesca's I
got this shirt I'm wearing it looks like
this just like printed and then I also
got this pretty tank top because it was
like buy one get one half off and I like
it
in the front has I got it symmetrical
kind of things so pretty
wait who said this is this is so you I
thank my friend Sarah my friend say I
was like wait Tasha I could see wearing
this and I'm like I'm buying it but I
bought like black skinny jeans maybe
like ripped ones and like black watches
I almost say it with black skinny jean
right or white ones honestly but yeah oh
so then from Francesca's I got these big
pearl earrings because I wanted nice new
pearl earrings so I got big pearl
hearing from Francesca's and then I'll
show you the other thing I got from
Francesca's which is this pillow that
says dorm sweet dorm I'm gonna put it my
dorm in Tokyo I love that yeah I just
got this plain necklace but I thought it
was cute and it's just like twisted so
like looks cool I can wear whatever yeah
from Sephora a little checkout where
they have like a million things I came
so basically it's just this Urban Decay
trio of eyeliner and it's like their
pencil eyeliner because I use only
pencil like on my upper lash line and
they have the black one the brown one
and like a dark purple and there are
like little minis and I wanted to try
them out so yeah Tasha such as pro that
she can put like pencil oh yeah just
some makeup oh my really can't do pencil
on the top and from Sephora I got two
things I knew I wanted to get I got this
back a highlighter which is way too
expensive but whatever and it's in the
color opal and it's really hard to open
it okay it's like that it's shiny and
then I got this to our eyeliner which
has been my favorite for like ever and I
just need a new one cuz they run out way
too quick if anyone from Stila is
watching this your eyeliner runs out too
quick mm-hmm they probably aren't but
whatever and it's just the stay all day
waterproof liquid eyeliner yeah in black
oh and then I had like a million point
because I've never used them Gretchen
had 1,600 points
I had 300 and that's accumulated from
like for years once reflect here people
I don't know where the other thing went
oh it's lipid cleanser it must have
rolled somewhere oh there it is
so I got like the 500 point thing and
it's bullsháá I'm gonna tell you
say it and it's just like all this skin
stuff and there's black cleanser that's
detoxifying there with mini so
illuminating black mass a poor purifying
strip and revitalizing black hydration
gel so that's really fun I got this
another rib did gray oh I see like from
Efrain going on cuz it's so soft and
cute and kind of like a super song it's
like yeah okay I have a lot of stuff
from forever 21 I'll just show you one
thing at a time first I got these pack
of Ewing's so they're just like I don't
know a little like gold designs and then
I'm wearing some right now and then from
Urban Outfitters I got this royal blue
bralette because I'm obsessed with royal
blue and that's royal blue
Tasha unless you know I probably so
annoyed by kappa stream is plumb ebay
you guys don't know because you're
catching yeah i guess but like i always
so many for those already 20 comments
probably know already you may just
search tapestry and the million come up
and it's way cheaper than urbane so look
yeah they're shirt from forever 21 and
it kind of reminded me of branding
almost and it's like there's like little
white stripes and i think it's black
yeah I think so
yeah and there's like two white stripes
throughout it I really like it and it's
like a soft material and it's like the
perfect length I think I got from
furbish me one are these oh my gosh
it's literally a mess right now I got
these lace-up sandals new only 20
dollars and I wanted them in both colors
like black and tan but they didn't have
my size in the tan so you know maybe
I'll get them online
maybe I'll control myself but they're
just like black and then strappy and
they lace up your leg and you eyes they
probably can't tell there's so many but
I love that when they will be $20 I
thought that was so good and I've wanted
a pair of like lace-up shoes and these
have a little toe I'm really sorry I
know I normally do Tryon holes but we
got so much stuff and we're just all
really busy going back to school so
we're just not gonna make this Tryon
we're gonna throw it back to the days
when no one did this onto my next item
which is from Pottery Barn and Lucy and
Tasha think I'm insane
but I wanted a white fluffy pillow
forever like for my dorm room whatever
and I knew that they had at Pottery Barn
and it was like the most expensive one
but I was like looking at other places
and I was like I don't know and there's
a party bar in the mall and I was like
guys like I'm just gonna go look but
then I had to get it because he was
tough
you see and I wasn't getting outside for
like 20 minutes we're looking at each
other got cheese by was stupid pill no
we're like if she comes out with that
pillow with you things like every text
event don't kill me
it's like a white fur cover but then
there's a white like insert that you
have to buy to so ends up being like $65
but it's really worth it because it's so
fluffy I'm gonna die and I'm gonna bring
it to college with me yeah basically
it's my favourite purchase so I got a
pair of super skinny jeans from abaca me
not jeggings and yeah they're just
normal you like dark wash but not like
really dark yeah I'd say like a medium
dark one ya know what I'm sayin I
already have a pair of like dark wash
ones and like I don't know you need
jeans from my original Ike and I mean I
don't wear leggings that much that's
weird I feel like you're the opposite of
like most girls bad yeah 20 girls like
oh my god I don't even know Angie it's
like leggings oh I always wear jeans
they I'd rather wear like black jeans
but my gangster outfits and jeans are
pretty too yeah okay I saw a girl
wearing his pants and I was in New York
City but I didn't know where they were
from and I saw them into forever 21 and
they're so cute like I guess they're
kind of crazy I mean I feel like some
people might hate them but they're like
the paper bag style shorts where the top
is like I don't know I didn't know they
were called that yeah it's like a
lunatic style and then there's like a
tire on it so there's like a little tied
up like a bow and then they just go down
and I have to cock them because I'm a
midget I'm five foot one really I feel
cos do you know what I mean so then from
forever 21 I got this white top just has
like lace going down the front and the
back a little bit and the sleeves are
flowy and I just thought by itself I
thought it was really cute and then from
forever 21 this is actually a boys
jacket but I just thought like sitting
by itself and it's basically like an
army green long like military jacket but
it has like gray like sweatshirt easly
and like a hood and it's the most
comfortable thing ever I tried it on and
I loved it and I don't want to care that
it's boys to them but pretty good on you
guys cuz you're tall I got the same
thing just with black and gray because I
really like the green and gray one that
Gretchen bad even mark and then yeah I
am but then I already have like green
jacket so like yeah she's got this one
it's cute very meek okay the last thing
I got it goes with the parents and I was
like saying - Gretchen like oh I feel
like I need a bodysuit wear these pants
because they go really high up on me so
like most crop tops would still be too
long and this sure was hanging up and I
made GUCH and get it because you know
she's tall I'm going to like you it's
like black crochet I make a crop top but
it hits like the perfect spotting right
about those pants and it's really cute
I usually it looks like a bra but
actually it's like longer yeah with the
pants it goes and I just have a couple
more things to show you
Tasha's casually drink her iced coffee
so I'll show you my jeans I got from
Abercrombie they're like kinda like the
ones that Lucy got except for they're
high-waisted they're like I think
weren't the same in the door they're
like destroyed they had like a little
rips like right there in the back but
yeah they go up a little higher
oh wait quick tip if you get high
waisted jeans they make your butt look
really good because you had pockets well
piyo so your butt looks bigger like I
told Tasha no I was like okay is it just
me or do the pockets go up higher she's
like yeah they do and I was about to say
cuz they make my butt bigger she's like
they make your public figure
oh yeah you know the first big gift she
went to was Mac and I got two things I
wasn't really planning on it but they
sucked me in I wanted like a darker
blush I got its blush and it's in the
color plum foolery it's like a darker I
would say maroonish color but it kind of
like a berry color there's some shimmer
in it
and I really like it because it's darker
and I don't really have that many dark
pushes got this eyeshadow in the color
sweet heat and it's just like a pretty
swirly champagne color but it's really
shiny and like soft I don't know it's
cool Christian by the side shadow she's
like I'm gonna wear this and I'll get
ready video we like film to get ready
video
gonna be on my channel together and then
she like does her makeup and she's like
oh wait I didn't use the eyeshadow god
but I will use it sometimes well
actually got to like three ish things
from Victoria's Secret but one of them
is under air and they're on my body
right now so I can't show you then I got
a bathing suit and I got these bottoms
they're like coral and they're a little
cheeky candalas I like them because they
go with this top that I got that I've
actually seen for a while and I kind of
wanted it it's like black but it has
turquoise and like lime green and like
neon coral that matches the bottoms
perfectly yeah they go together that was
like pinky colors so yeah that's all for
me okay well I got ya boyfriend jeans
cuz well this is the second time I went
to Epcot me and then I was like wait I
haven't see these before and they're
like all right down the front and it's
really I love them and I love that I
touch the bottoms because otherwise
there's no you yeah and that's really
good on Lucy they're talking I like them
