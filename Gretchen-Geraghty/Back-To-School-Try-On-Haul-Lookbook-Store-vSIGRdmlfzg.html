back to school haul video and I know
another haul I'm like obsessed with
shopping I've been spending so much
money recently which is like not good
but shopping is just like a part of me I
don't know last night it was 4 a.m. and
I ordered online from two different
places you've established there's a
problem and everything I have to show
you it's from look bookstore it's just
this online website and I've literally
been obsessed with it recently like
everything on there is so cute they have
the cutest like printed wrappers and
dresses and they've these jeans I got
that I'm so obsessed with so I just have
a bunch of stuff to show you sorry I'm
in a weird setup right now I'm actually
sitting on the ground in my parents
bedroom don't ask I don't know I just
yeah but it's all gonna be try on for
you guys I actually tried on everything
right before I found this so you'll be
able to see what it looks like on and I
know I like seeing people's clothes on
them better than than just holding it up
so the first thing I have to show you is
actually just this coral dress that I'm
wearing right now and just like this
neon bright coral color and in the back
there's like this neat little design and
I think it's so cute how it's like
crochet in the back and just like right
coral and it's really swingy and it has
like this like chiffon layer on the top
so I think it's so cute it's really
comfortable too because it's really like
loose and flowy so I love this and then
the next thing I have to show you is
just this romper and it's black on the
top and white in black chevron stripes
on the bottom and I'm seriously obsessed
with this I think it took you I'm
actually wearing it to dinner tonight so
the top is just black and it has like
these little cups on the top so you
don't have to wear a bra that's really
nice and then the only thing I don't
like about it is how there's that like
pointy part right there at the top of
the cup so I kind of like fold it under
when I wear I just like fold down the
pointy part so it just looks like this
like kind of smooth looking and just
round and I like the bottom because
they're like shorts but they're really
swingy and loose so it almost looks like
a skirt I have nothing like it so
definitely nor that long next thing I
got is a romper I got like a Cove
rompers from them cuz they just have the
cutest like printed rompers ever and
this one's just white with some blue
designs and I actually got this because
my friend on here for your speaker show
Tasha
you guys know her she's my bed I love
her
and I saw her picture with it on
Instagram and I was like I need that
also I don't know if it's supposed to
cut like all the way down on your wrist
because I know when I saw Tasha wearing
it and went all the way down to her
wrist but like I'm really tall and have
different fortunes so my only goes like
to there but I kind of like it like
three-quarter length so I don't know if
it's supposed to be 3/4 length through
long and the next thing I got is also a
romper it's just a black romper with
black like crochet lace on the top and
then again like the last one it's like
shorts on the bottom because de romper
but it's like really flowy it almost
looks like a skirt I really like the fit
of that like I think it's really
flattering and cute and then I'm
obsessed with the back of this one
because it kind of cuts open in the back
like that but you can still see the lace
like on your shoulders and I know I'm
gonna wear this at BU that's the College
of going to if you guys didn't know most
of you probably do know when I slicked
dress up at bu this will be great and
it's just all black all black like
dresses and rock person stuff I always
find myself wearing cuz it's so easy to
just like throw on what is this I don't
know by the way do you like my nude lips
I decided I would TVT it to like ninth
grade when I wore like nude lips all the
time so what are you guys think oh and
I'm actually I use like a new eyeshadow
palette that I got from Justin's grandma
Gigi got me like a really cute Mac
eyeshadows so if you want a tutorial of
this look just let me know okay this is
getting really off topic the next thing
I got actually forgot to show so here I
am just trying on it's just this white
tank top and it has some like cutout
designs kind of dealios on the back
right there and along the bottom and
like I showed you it's all like open in
the back and then I really like how
there's all that like lace detail at the
top and the front I think it's so cute
and unique I have two more things to
show you the first thing is this white
is it white or cream
I don't know it's AIT's more white than
cream this white crochet top and it just
ties around your neck and ties around
the back and so the backs all open and
I've been wanting a white like crochet
crop top like this forever I think it's
so cute and I found like the prettiest
one on the lookbook store so I just love
this and also look so cute with the next
thing I'm sure
which are these jeans and I wanted jeans
like this for so long and I think they
have ones like these at a Topshop that I
wanted but they're like really expensive
wait was a Topshop or like Zara or
something they definitely have jeans
that look like this like other places
that are just like so so distressed and
it's the way they looked like cuffed at
the bottom and these ones really big on
me but it's okay I think it's like
really cute and goes with the whole look
so that is everything I got from what
bookstore and if you guys like this
video please remember to thumbs it up
whoo I never say that but I think it's
fun to see how many thumbs ups I can get
so thank you so much for watching and
I'll see you my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
