clothes mostly from brandy melville and
Urban Outfitters also as you can tell
from the title there's going to be a
giveaway in this video and that is for
50,000 I am so happy that I hit 50,000 I

cushy but like I couldn't have done it

outfit from brandy melville I got you

only had one and I was like alright
there for you guys the first thing is
these shorts and they're high-waisted
blue and white floral print shorts so so
cute I literally love those and then to
go with you this white little halter top
and I absolutely love this and I really
want to get this for myself too but I
didn't because I have a bunch of white
crop tops you know they look so good
together and then to go with you get a
necklace in a ring and I actually got
them for myself two will be twins I'm
wearing the ring right now it's like a
little wishbone ring and then I got you
the same necklace is me it's just this
gold moon necklace I don't know if you
can tell it's really small but I think
it's so like dainty and just perfect

that outfit let's get into the haul all
the clothes I have are from Urban
Outfitters and brandy melville we went
some other places but I really just
found clothes there first let's do
brandy melville so like I said before I
got this little wishbone ring and I got
this little moon necklace it's gold and
I think it's so cute and like dainty I
got use floral high-waisted printed
shorts and I think they are so adorable
I really wanted some like fabric II high
waisted shorts and these are exactly
what I was looking for and they look
really cute in September you know when
it's still hot when you go to school I
think that looks so cute with like any
sort of crop top or a sweater certain
really comfortable and I also got them
in this blue like Aztec looking print I
think these ones are so so cute and they
kind of remind me of the ones that you
got so I got these ones I don't know if
you know it's like a white top from
brandy melville and it's called the
Gisele top it's like a white crop top
and I wear honestly all the time this
reminded me of it a lot it's just like
it except for it's like longer it's
really stretchy that really soft
material I love it's just like white or
like cream and it dips really low in the
back in the front which i think is like
really unique so adorable on and it
like form-fitting so I like that also in
the same stretch material are these
marine jorts from brandy that are so
comfortable and yeah I just forgot to
show them and then the last thing I got
it Brandi or these pants which are kind
of crazy but there's just these flowy
black pants they're like stretchy at the
top they're really comfortable these
will transition great into the school
year because they're pants and you can
wear them when it gets a little bit
chillier too then my last few things are
from Urban Outfitters and I always find
the best of they're on sale the first
thing I got is this black like lace
crochet skirt and TBT - freshman year
when we all were body con skirts but it
isn't really body con it's like kind of
it's just like a straight down skirt and
I think it would be really good for like
dressing up and I just thought it'd be
really versatile since it's just a black
skirt and has a zipper in the back and
it's just all like floral lace then I
got this halter dress which i think is
so adorable and so unique I don't know
why it reminds me of Marilyn Monroe did
Marilyn Monroe wear this I think she
wore it in white but it's just like
least and I think it's so unique it's
like a really pretty like Swing skater
dress almost with the halter top love
love love this the last thing I got is
this white lace dress from Urban
Outfitters I am obsessed with this I
think it's so cute I love like all the
designs right there and then it zips up
the back I don't know if you guys have a
track near where you live you know like
a horse racetrack they're really fun
it's like go watch horse races it's fun
like dress up and I think this would
even be a good like first day of school
a dress like going into the school year
because it's just really pretty and I
like to dress up on the first day so
yeah that is everything that I got and
like I said before if you have questions
about the giveaway totally just tweet at
me I hope you liked everything I got and
maybe it gave you some ideas for a
clothes that you might want to get when
you are back-to-school shopping
flowy comfortable high-waisted shorts
are a really really good thing and some
nice dresses because you don't have to
worry about matching them at school you
just throw it on and pop on the school
bus that is everything I got and as
always I love you guys so so so so much
I am so happy for 50,000 you don't even
know like that's so exciting
and whenever anyone says like you have
50,000 subscribers I'm like whoa hold up
like I just forget and so it's crazy to
me and you guys are literally the best I
love you so much
