to school haul video and I'm actually
excited to go back as weird as that
sounds just because it's senior year I
one year left of high school and my
classes seem really interesting and I
don't know usually I'm pretty nervous
for back to school but that's here I'm
excited I have stuff from Target packs

seriously considering coming we just

people will be coming but yeah we'll
just be shopping around all day long and
hopefully we get to meet some of you I'm
really excited to meet some more of you
I've met a lot of you there already and
some other places but I just love
meeting you guys so much and Tasha and I
are really really excited we'll also be
filming YouTube videos while she's here
so if you guys want to leave some
requests down below on videos you'd like
to see us together we're gonna film some
haul videos I think maybe even the
blindfolded makeup challenge I've always
wanted to do that so if that sounds
interesting to you guys let me know so
the first place I'll just start off with
is Target
and I randomly ran in and like I wasn't
even planning to get anything can you
please tell me if you walk in there and
you walk out with 200 dollars of stuff
that you didn't even want initially like
is that just me
I got these cheaper in pots I'm gonna
look so cute with like jeans or skirts
or dresses whatever I just saw these
ones and I really liked them as well
these ones are tan I think these will go
with so much and they're just really
neutral I have this brown leather bag
from forever 21 and it broke and I was
really upset but then again it's like
forever 21 so it was bound to happen it
was like cheap from Target I'm pretty
sure everyone has these but I just saw
and I thought it was so cute and it's
just this brown leather bag and I may or
may not be using this for school like
for my school bucks I usually use like
Longchamp bags but I might use this one
just because I think it's really cute
probably not like the greatest quality
ever but whatever I liked it wasn't too
expensive so there's that oh look what I
threw in here my planner from Lilly this
is a planner I'm gonna use this year
it's Lilly I love it cuz as all these
elephants and if you guys know I love
elephants
so it makes it super excited to use this
this is my mcc's I had to go back to
school just so I can use my planner that
is all I got from Target and now I will
just go on to Abercrombie and they've
had like some pretty good sales recently
so I was hopping up on that so I decided
to get these bathing suit bottoms and no
it doesn't really quite fit with the
back-to-school theme but I mean it's
still warm out and I'm still like
swimming right now so I guess I'll still
use these and he just spoke to me
they're like graduating by me their hot
pink lace swimsuit bottoms and I'm just
obsessed with them I think they're so so
cute and Easons we're just calling my
name next round we're coming are these
two crap tops and one is this white lace
crochet one wow I'm really liking the
lace all of these early cuz it kind of
just reminds me of a white crop top but
it's more like intricate with like the
designs and it's really stretchy and
still comfortable I love this crop top
and then this one is a little more
scandalous I wore this with a pair of
shorts a bot and I know you might be
thinking this doesn't really like back
to school but it is because at least
where I live it stays hot for a while
like I can get away with wearing shorts
until like October I'll still be able to
wear these so I wore this in these
shorts I also got from ever coming to a
concert but yeah this is just navy blue
and
lace and I just really like the cut of
it I can't tell you how many pairs of
light wash high-waisted ripped shorts I
have I have so many piling like five or
six but these ones just looked so so
cute I couldn't pass them off
they have like really big shreds down
the front so I just love some of them
it's in the last thing from Abercrombie
is these pattern shorts and these are a
little more school appropriate I kind of
asked AG print and they actually really
said it with this white crop top as well
I know I'll be getting a lot of wear out
of these because they're really
comfortable and I've been obsessed with
like flowy patterned shorts then I will
move on to forever 21 the first thing I
got is this romper and it's black with
spaghetti straps I really like the front
of it how it like it like drapes pretty
low in the front right there that is so
cool it has this like caged design and
this will be great for like layering
once it gets a little cooler in this
romper I told myself I was gonna wear in
the first day of school but now I'm not
too sure if it's like that school
appropriate I didn't know there's gonna
big cut out in the sky it's black and
it's long-sleeve and in the front ties
into a little bow right there but what I
didn't know is like right underneath the
bow right there it's just like open of
your stomach I just thought it was so
adorable I'm so happy I got it
and these next two things look very very
similar I swear they're a little
different and I just like them both for
their own reasons
they're like cream long cardigans that
are short sleeved with fringe at the
bottom they both are but this first one
is kind of like more lightweight and
it's a little more tan and then this
second one is a little bit like heavier
crochet material and then the bottom has
like a little bit more fringe and it's a
little bit longer I think but I really
really like both of these and I have
this one cream cardigan that's
long-sleeve from brandy melville and I
literally wear every day so I've got
them to wear these all the time
the last thing from forever 21 are just
these black high-waisted shorts and I
love them because they have these cool
little pom-pom details these shorts will
go with so much just because they're
black high-waisted shorts look you can
literally wear these with anything I
know I'll be wearing them so much and
from American Eagle I just got these
wash jeans literally all the jeans I
have are just dark wash skinny jeans
those are like really the only jeans I
wear anyway I just decided to get a new
pair for the fall and they're just like
your classic dark skinny jeans they
might even be jeggings but whatever
they're just like skinny jeans better
dark wash
yep then from airy I got I don't know if
this is like weird to show but I feel
like I've showed bras before and I'll
just show you guys I got the bear bra
which is to wear doesn't have a back it
just goes on the front and it's to wear
with stuff that's like really low backed
or that I think you could like see your
bra on
so I have some shirts and some dresses
that like cut really low in the back
I've always liked the way it looked when
you like can't see a bra at all so I've
been meaning to pick up one of these and
I saw and I was like I remember I need
this it'll just be good to wear with
like open back tops stuff like that and
they're just like little cups that you
put right there and Oh Lucy and I both
got them so that's why YouTube in the
last place I got stuff from is pack size
and I'm obsessed with like everything I
got so the first thing is this cream
shirt I had like this lace stripe across
the bottom it's like cold shoulder is
that what they're called like it has
cutouts on the shoulders and then
there's like a little sleeve I just know
I'm gonna wear this so much because it's
like really neutral then I got this same
style top and I just was obsessed with
this print like I just think it's so
adorable and it has the cutouts on the
shoulder and I love love and then that's
clothing item I got from PacSun is this
dress and as this cool blue heart on the
tag I don't really oh that means it's
from the Kendall + Kylie collection
interasante so I just thought this dress
was so cute it's like long-sleeve and I
could even wear this on the first day
and it's like loose when you put it on
it's kind of like the fit of like a
babydoll dress look a shift dress I'm a
sucker for floral patterned dresses I've
come to realize because like all my
dresses are like floral pattern and then
the last few things I got our jewelry
from PacSun I got this little pack of
bracelets there's like a turquoise one a
feather one and like a little circle and
I think it'll just be good for like
layering on top of each other and it's
like mixed with other bracelets I have
as well then I just go this necklace and
I've been obsessed with like layering
necklace
is it has this top one with like a
little feather this one which I think is
like a dreamcatcher and then this is
just a turquoise stone but I just love
meeting you guys so much and Tosh and I
are really really excited so yeah just
leave some requests of videos you would
like to see us do down below and I'm
very excited I hope I get to see a lot
of you on Saturday</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
