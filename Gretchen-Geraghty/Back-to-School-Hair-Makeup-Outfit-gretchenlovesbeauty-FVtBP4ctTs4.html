hair and naturally it's kind of like
bumpy wavy a little weird and I don't
straighten it every day I just do it
sometimes and especially like at the
beginning this foyer and I'm still
trying to look nice and press my
teachers you know so I'm just going to
straighten my hair and I don't do it in
any specific way I just keep brushing it
and putting some heat protectant in it
just like that
and it usually only takes me like five
or ten minutes because I just go through
it really quickly and kind of messily
and excuse my no makeup during that
whole segment I am so sorry you had to
watch that but here I am getting started
on my makeup and the first thing I'm
doing is just using some concealer on my
blemishes which I don't have too many
cuz it's the summer that was just some
bare minerals concealer and this is
benefits bake up like under-eye
concealer and now this is like a new
brush I got from Sedona lease I'll have
them all linked down below that's just a
fan brush that I use some bare minerals
but then I am curling my eyelashes and
using mac's blacktrack fluidline richer
it's called it's just some gel eyeliner
and I do a thin line on the top and I
have to drag it underneath to just to
find my eyes more and then I like to put
some black eyeshadow on top just to set
it make it look a little bit darker and
it makes it stay longer too and then
it's time for mascara and I usually will
do like two or three coats but I know
that it sounds like a lot but I just
like the look of like thick eyelashes
because especially my eyelashes aren't
too long as it is so that's just one
coat that's what that looks like and
then I kept adding some more so there
are just some close-ups of my eyes with
a whole bunch of mascara on because
that's just the way I like it and so
yeah all of these are Sedona lace
brushes that's like a really cool tool
one that I like to use bronzer with
that's hoola from benefit and I really
like to contour my face and also bring
it down my neck to just blend it out and
that is deep throat by NARS is an
English and this is just a highlighter
from Mac it's called soft and gentle and
it just makes your cheekbones look
really shiny and highlight it and this
is a lip stain from Tarte that I like
because I don't like wearing lipstick or
stuff like that and the stains are
really good for school you don't have to
really worry about them and they just
keep your lips looking at nice and pink
so here are some close-ups of my makeup
and I cannot wear a crummy little tank
top to school now can I
so I decided I was going to wear this
green dress from American Eagle and my
sweater is from Abercrombie my sandals
that I wear like every day are from
Target they match everything they're
just crown and and my sweater is really
long like longer than I thought and it
has lots of fringe at the bottom and I
like to throw in my Alex and aunties
because I'm too lazy to pick out through
worry so I just wear them all the time
they're silver and they go with
everything
just like my Tiffany necklace that you
guys know I wear all the time and then I
put on some dolce and gabbana light blue
perfume which is one of my favorites and
it just smells really lemony and fresh
and that is my back full outfit I hope
you guys enjoyed and I will see you in
its video thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
