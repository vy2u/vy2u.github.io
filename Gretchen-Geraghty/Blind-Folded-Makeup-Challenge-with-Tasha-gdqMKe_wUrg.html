blindfolded makeup challenge with Tasha
we're actually using a headband as a
blindfold because I don't have a
blindfold but I promise it's black like
you can't see through it first I'm doing
Tasha's make up for my channel and then
she will be doing my makeup for her
channel so you can check that out I will
link it down below yeah let's do this
yeah blind bull goes on wait crap hey
that's the point first I'm doing funny
 I gotta blend it out right now as
you can see let me feel like it's yours
you what it is I'm just feeling a trap
your face is really smooth Thanks okay
so there's all blended pit stop then you
ought to do some under-eye concealer to
conceal a little surprise we've got a
box of mysterious what can I see the box
there's like so this is the box with all
the makeup the parts part is just
finding women oh yeah here is the
concealer there's one and then there's
the other one right there you gotta
blend that out like that he's the thumbs
a thought up I thought was the great
finger now I need powder to set your
beautiful foundation this is powder and
so you need a big fluffy brush which is
this
this is to still find Cup I don't really
know where the brush is yelling right
now I think that pretty much set the
foundation I would say so then we will
do bronzer is perfect actually can cheat
cuz can I smell it so I can tell if it's
a bronzer you can just use whatever you
yes if this is the bronzer I'm sorry I
face pitching it yes and so we're going
to go for that sweet contour we're going
to do the cheekbones and we're going to
do the forehead first we'll do some
cheap
I think so ok
now we are contouring the forehead to
make you look nice and bronze like
summer time at the beach now we gotta do
the blush now i'm using blush for her
cheeks and you want to use to look at
that a lot the more the merrier and I'm
actually like meaning it like you
actually have to do a lot when you do
this blush is it's kind of like light I
think dad to know now you use
highlighter it's soft and gentle by
mouth I can tell you down the traffic
shape right there
okay you can do it on your nose if you
want to be fancy soon yeah right there

face makeup though thumbs up yeah like I
really think I killed it with a face
makeup and like I got the blush and it
looks like i did the bronzer may be okay
