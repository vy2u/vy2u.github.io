video and it's actually a haul video
from everything that I got while I was
in Boston for two days and I just went
there with Justin and his family we went
up for Marathon Monday or like the
Boston Marathon and we went to a
baseball game - and we saw the Red Sox
play so that was super super fun and I'm
so happy I was able to go and we also
went shopping in Quincy Market and all
around Boston like Newberry Street and
stuff I also had a Boston vlog that I
put up recently so if you haven't seen
that definitely check it out down below
because I tried to vlog a lot while we
were there and there's a whole lot of
Justin in there and you guys like when
Justin is in my videos I just have some
things to show you that I got like Urban
Outfitters and I got some new Rabin so
let's just get right into it the first
things I'll show you our new Ravens beer
just walking around like Quincy Market
and we went into sunglass hut and I saw
these Ravens and I put them on and I
just did not want to take them off but
yeah I literally just loved them so much
they are kind of like my blacklist you
guys don't know I have like the
all-black Ravens
but these ones are just Brown and I
think the lenses are a little bit bigger
- they're kind of bigger than the normal
ones and I'm just so obsessed and I'm so
happy that I got them because I just
think they're so cute and I put them on
and I was like I'm buying these because
I'm not taking them off so it was very
like spontaneous for me to buy these but
I just really liked them a lot so I
could not pass them up what is in here
doing these are like pictures dressed
and I took in one of those photobooth so
cute then I went to urban outfitters and
I was so excited because we don't have
an Urban Outfitters very live so
whenever I go places I always like when
Urban Outfitters and oh my gosh I think
it's artery and I better like wrap this
up but I just got this sweater from
Urban Outfitters and it's like cream and
it has somewhat Greensleeves and I just
think it's so cute and I actually saw it
on why I'm like a little while ago and I
knew I really liked it and I wanted to
order online so I saw it in the store I
was like yes I actually haven't even
tried it on yet so now as you're seeing
me trying it on it's the first time I've
tried it on and I hope it fits lol but
that newellton brandy melville and if
you guys saw my last haul video my big
huge spring like try on haul video
see that I ordered stuff from brandy
melville and I actually got this black
bralette it was supposed to be a tank
top I ordered the tank top but they sent
me a bra
so I told Justin about it and I was
suggesting they like sent me a bra
even though I ordered a tank top and he
was like all right like if we go to
brandy melville and I have the tank top
I'll buy you the tank top so they had it
and he got it for me and I'm really
happy I got this because this is the one
I initially wanted and it's literally
exactly the same as the bralette but
just a little bit longer so you can wear
it as like a shirt instead of like a bra
wet so I really really like this and I
just think the detail at the top is so
cute and Justin's sister Jacqueline
actually got it to me too so but you're
gonna be twins of course we had to go to
little lemon because I'm obsessed with
Lululemon and Lucy actually has these
pants from Lululemon they're called em
to the street pants I think that's what
they're called thank you she want them
whoa it's soaked with me well she has
them with this forest green color and
they're so cute and I'm always been
obsessed fan so I knew I wanted him in
maroon and they had my size and I'm so
happy I got these they're so color and
you can wear them like working out or
just wear them like whatever and they
have the little and this actually isn't
mine this is for my friend Taylor I got
it for her for her birthday so happy
birthday Taylor I'm so happy you finally
18 with me whoa but these are like one
of my favorite tank tops from women they
just have the skinny straps in the back
and this is like the magenta one and
they're good because they have like a
padded bra like in there or when you're
working out but yeah this isn't mine I'm
giving them to Taylor so I'm really dumb
and I deleted some of my footage but
these are just some black shorts that I
got from Lululemon also while I was in
Boston they're just the flap like
running shorts and they have a cool
little like pocket right there and it
like sits back and forth lots led to
play with and they also have like a
little vent on the side I was trying to
show you I don't know it's I guess it's
good if you're like running and yet
that's like the Lululemon sign and
they're really like stretchy and
comfortable just good running shorts
they're a little bit shorter though and
this is a shirt I got and it's actually
from Gigi Justin's grandmother and she
got it for me and I believe it is from
Banana Republic and it's just a shirt
with a bunch of elephants on it because
she knows that I love elephants and I'm
literally obsessed with this shirt it's
so perfect in cute and
last thing from Boston I have to show
you is actually this little workout
shirt but we pick the worst day to come
outside but I actually filmed outside
right now because in my workout
essential video I found outside and you
guys really it looks like you're coming
to the new lines like the lighting so
good so I'm gonna film outside when I
can as long as it's not like blowing me
away so this last thing I got from
Boston it's just this bluish purple
athletic shirt and it says Boston
Athletic Association Boston Marathon
2015 right there and then it has a
little DJ's logo because it's like from
adidas it has poorly orange neon stripes
right there just like it really nice
like dry fit athletic shirt and the back
has this full pattern material thing and
honestly just watching the marathon was
so cool in Boston like like not to keep
be cheesy but it was honestly inspiring
like watching their sound like it was so
cool I actually want to show you two
more things that I did get involved in
but I just have been forgetting to show
you
and these are my oakley's which I showed
in my workout in central video but I
didn't show in my haul video and I
wanted to because I got them recently
and they're just all black sunglasses
and I mean check out polarized lenses so
that they help when you're like growing
and outside like it makes your eyes not
as tired and they like protects them I
think I mentioned in a vlog about these
that I actually got the frame separately
and then I bought the lens separately
because I wanted black polarized big
lenses and I wanted the flacc 2.0 frames
so that's what these are in case you're
interested and I'm just really obsessed
with them this is like the third video
I've showed them in now but I never
actually like to show them in a haul
video so I just wanted to show them and
this super quick and then these I've
been forgetting to show forever these
are beam boots that I got I'm so happy I
finally got them I forgot to show these
in my haul video but I actually order
these in the beginning of December and
they didn't come to like mid April which
I know is like crazy I waited four
months for them
like out of stock and I knew I wanted to
like chocolatey brown one and now
they're not even be in my outfit of the
weeks or anything because it's like warm
out and I really can't wear them anymore
so I'm kind of sad like I got to wear
them like a couple times before it
turned into spring but I'll be able to
wear them like next fall and stuff
surprisingly these are actually kids
being boots
third a size six because I'm like a
woman size eight so they fit me perfect
they're actually kind of a little big on
me
so if you're a woman size they even get
like the kid size six bean boots just
like a heads up and I think they're
cheaper that way too and these are just
the chocolatey brown ones because I
don't want the normally tan ones that
like everyone has I knew I wanted like
something different so I really like
these chocolatey brown ones and they're
so cute even though I really can't wear
them anymore since it's like spring and
summer that is just everything I got
from Boston and I had so much fun make
sure to check out my blog down below
like I said and they you so much
watching I'll see my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
