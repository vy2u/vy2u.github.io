video is just going to be at Justin's
morning routine and my morning routine
and it starts off by Justin waking up to
his alarm in the morning we both don't
like getting up for our college classes
but eventually Justin hook it up and
start getting ready for the day he
really does a lot less than I do so I
think this video is funny because it
shows just how little boys do versus
curls in the morning to get ready now
it's my turn to wake up and I'm usually
a zombie in the morning I hate getting
up because I usually never get enough
sleep but I do finally get up and I take
a lot longer than Justin to get out of
it I like to sit on my phone for a while
and check through my social media I go
on my Instagram my Twitter by the way
you can follow me my Instagram is that
Gretchen loves fede and my twitter is at
jlv YT and I really like interacting
with you guys on there and then I'm just
Pat April goodbye and it's time for me
to get out of bed and start getting
ready for the day and I'm stressin is
out of bed of him and his roommate Matt
but on their cute little matching
moccasins and Justin is just going to
grab his toothbrush and stuff like that
fact that I'm Matt thank you for helping
Justin's on this video it was very nice
of you
he's is it great to help and that
interesting that both head down the
hallway to the community bathroom it
doesn't am i right now I'm just putting
on my moccasins to go to the bathroom as
well I copy Justin and I grab just my
toiletry bag now that Justin is in the
bathroom really all he does is brush his
teeth because boys don't have to do
anything at all morning security I know
some do more than others but Justin is
pretty simple dude in him in his
roommate Matt just hang out in the
bathroom chat a little bit
brush their teeth and when I'm in the
bathroom I do a whole lot more than that
I have to wash my face brush my teeth
you know all that so the first thing I'm
doing is just putting my hair back to
get it out of the way for everything I'm
going to be doing and the next thing I'm
doing is just washing my face first I
just like to get my face all wet and I'm
using the purity by philosophy face
cleanser just of my favorite recently
and I'm going to be using the vanity
planet spin for perfect skin face
cleansing brush in this thing
has been a life saver recently guys I
can't even explain to you how well this
has been working for my skin because as
you guys know I struggle with my skin a
lot but you will see how clear just my
skin has been recently because I've been
using this for the past couple weeks and
I've been wanting to invest in a spin
brush like this for a while now but some
can be so expensive
so after lots of research I found that
this was the most affordable for me and
it's just been doing wonders and you can
especially tell how good it's working
because of how dirty the brush is after
kids so much dirt and makeup off your
face you can get yours for only $30 it's
seriously such a good deal and I'll have
it linked down below if you're
interested then afterwards I just used
some more cleanser up and rub it on my
eyes to make sure I get all my makeup
off and then I just use paper towels
lol torna bathroom props to dry my face
off did you guys see how good my skin
looks I've never been self confident
with the way my skin looks and I'm
struggling to get the rest of my
toothpaste out of the tube so I can
brush my teeth do you guys know this
struggle and I'm just brushing my teeth
of like normal and nice little lizzie
who's helping me Phil makes Lu usually
she accompanies me in the bathroom in
the morning as well since she lives it
all right across the hall
when Justin gets back to his room he
just got change really quick usually
likes to keep it pretty comfortable for
his classes he likes sweatshirts a lot
and just comfy clothes and he's putting
in his contact lenses because without
them he would not be able to see Wow
what a cutie with his contacts and I
usually like to keep it pretty
comfortable for my classes to you as you
can tell we're throwing a big comfy
baggy sweater and this is just my
everyday makeup routine I just start
with moisturizer and I also like to turn
on music with my new Bose speaker it
just gets me in a good mood for the
morning and then I'm using my current
lip balm which is just the fresh sugar
lip balm from Sephora and also give this
video a big thumbs up if you want to see
my everyday makeup routine then Justin
and his other remain Michael be for
class and this is what my finished
makeup looks like it's just very natural
and it's super quick and easy now I'm
putting my macbook away in this case but
I can bring it to classes for the day
hearing some loci
bracelets my Tiffany bracelet and this
ivory Ellen necklace my sweater is from
Abercrombie and actually got reminded to
era from one of you guys who tweeted me
that you have the same one and these
leggings are just loving the toasty
tektites

day putting on my along the black code

winters I grab my ID because you can't
forget that as a college student and I
am out the door
