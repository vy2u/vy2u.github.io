braces advice and like before and after
video right now I'm about to go to my
appointment to get my braces off and I'm
so excited this has been kind of like a
surprise for my friends and even my
family and you guys so this should be
like a surprise video so this is singing
my next video uploaded and I'm so
excited to get my braces off I mean some
I'm okay I've had them on for four years
so yeah I'll talk more later about like
advice and like how they feel blah blah
blah like once I get them off because
right now I'm in a rush alright that's
calling me I gotta go but yeah so
excited I'm getting my braces off and
I'll talk to you later bye okay guys so
I just got home from school and as you
saw in my last clip I got my braces off
and there they are oh my gosh isn't this
so weird I can't believe it I keep going
like that because they feel so weird and
big and like if you've gotten your
braces off you know what I'm talking
about
they feel so weird and slimy and like oh
I just keep doing that okay so as you
can tell I'm so excited and happy
because my braces have been on for four
years it's four years it's crazy and so
this is more of like a before and after
but I've been asked to give like some
advice like have you seen my previous
videos people have left like requests
for like a braces advice and really the
best advice I could give is as much as
you hate it listen to your orthodontist
because they like tell you not to eat
certain things and like to wear your
rubber bands definitely wear your rubber
bands because I were mine and it made it
go quicker and yeah I tried to eat
pretty well yeah I'd still eat gum just
don't tell anyone but like don't you so
that would break your braces okay and
about pain really my braces isn't it
have never hurt me that bad like every
time after I get them adjusted they've
always hurt a little bit so like for the
first two days after you get them
adjusted they'll hurt um
but you'll get used to it and then the
worst thing ever though before you get
braces you get
in your teeth they're like blue and they
space out your teeth to get them ready
for the braces those hurt so bad the
braces don't hurt the spacers are what
hurt and they're terrible for me
they were so bad I would literally go
home and cry and I had to take tylenol
like all the time but yeah so that's
really my advice listen to earth and
honest just do what you think will be
best like obviously brush really well
and floss
I obviously brush and floss like twice a
day with flossing um and with your
braces it's pretty hard but um
definitely I've always brushed like
twice a day I'm really good with that so
yeah I'm so excited that they're off
this is like crazy to me I can't believe
it surreal I feel so weird um but yeah
this was my pretty short and easy video
I mean I'm not like I'm not like an
expert I don't know like what other
advice to give you have any like
additional comments about braces just
leave them below Oh like what colors I
would get I would always get silver
every time because I was scared that the
color I got wouldn't match my outfit I
know that sounds so stupid saying yeah
wild but like yeah cuz that was I was a
weirdo but yeah so this is my before and
after braces video and I hope you
enjoyed leave a comment down below about
your like braces experience because I
love hearing about it even if it's
terrible and they hurt like I would
still have to know so thank you for
watching bye okay guys so oh yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
