today and now it is around 1:30 ish I
believe because I just finished working
at the Y I just got home this morning my
crew practice and at the end of my crew
practice I checked my email and guess
what was my acceptance to be you and I'm
so happy because like I kind of like
know I was going there for a while but I
officially got like something today and
so did Lucy it's our friend Taylor and
you can just tell obviously how excited
I am I'm seriously so excited
there's Pookie but I'm literally so
happy I got into bu and I just know like
some of the girls on the team already
and it's just gonna be so flippin
amazing like Janis and oh my god I'm
just so excited I decided I would vlog
today because I mentioned I would be
going to build-a-bear soon is my 18th
birthday hall and if you haven't seen
that I will link it down below so you
can go check it out
but Jess and I are going to build-a-bear
and I'm really excited so a lot of you
asked me to vlog it so that's why I
decided to vlog today because then I
could vlog me at build-a-bear making a
build-a-bear except Justin doesn't
really like when I'm in there okay my
happy birthday balloon is still there
the one that Taylor got me is literally
going strong it's been there for so long
like today is March 21st which is
acceptance Day and my friend Tasha
fiercely tossed as she got accepted to
so she might even come with me which is
so exciting but if she gets into like
other colleges in California like she
wanted to she will probably end up going
there but she might go to bu with me so
that would just be so exciting and just
am I gonna go to build-a-bear so I might
even from a video right now I'll
probably like shower cuz I'm all gross
from like working out and lifeguarding
and maybe I will feel myself getting
ready maybe like get ready with me date
night
thing also an ice-cream place opens up
today right knee right so today's a
great day because we Barnett we're going
to be you I get to go get some ice cream
cones it may be the best ice cream ever
and word on the street is that they have
soft-serve cake batter and cake batter
is like my favorite flavor ice cream
ever and it's kind of rare like you can
only find out like certain places ooh
I'm so excited because I want some ice
cream
and yeah I better go before I get like
really annoying because I'm like
screaming I know I'm so happy um yeah so
I will go shower maybe fill my video you
know you know you know and that video
probably won't be up for like two weeks
because I suck and it takes me so long
to edit videos like literally don't know
if you guys are like this too or like
any of you other youtubers that like
edit videos or even I was like homework
assignments or something but I'm
literally perfectionist like I will not
hand in something until it's like
perfectly done like I will stay up all
night long going way overboard on
assignments because I'm like you know
what if I'm gonna take time doing it at
all it's gonna be done right and it's
gonna be done the way I want it so when
I edit YouTube videos it's kind of like
that hi are you so happy we got our
acceptance letters cuz I am show them
