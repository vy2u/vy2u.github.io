let's start over
good morning guys so I just look up as
you can tell my mind obviously from the
title this video I'm in Cancun right now
this video is just going to be my
morning routine it's actually going to
be a vlog style I just thought this
would be fun and different than my other
morning routines that I know that you
guys like those types videos
I'm leaving Cancun today I'm so sad I
love it here like look at my view from
my room ah
he walks it all makes this
suddenly you're climbing long time kids
my teeth yeah yeah yeah school you you
don't want me you just want us to see
this and also you guys are probably
wondering if you notice I still have
some eye makeup on from last night by
like no face makeup on because last
night when I got back I was so tired
mean Shelley dinner so late so I just
took off all my face makeup look I make
it moving wise but I just didn't even
bother doing my acts I was really tired
so I'm gonna take off my eye makeup
right now I guess I'm going to be going
at the beach this morning that's what I
did yesterday morning - so I took off my
eye makeup as you can tell I was just
gonna put mascara on my pride today
since I'm just gonna have a beach day
and I'm flying home but then I was like
you know what I don't want to and I've
been really getting until I could not
wearing any makeup recently and now I
just gotta go put on being see I know I
was only here for like three days
something like an ongoing routine but
this is exactly what I did yesterday so
I was here forever this is probably what
I do every day
anyway you rascal you don't want me you
just want your ecstasy ecstasy I just
put on a little sim dress
gonna get breakfast I'm so hungry
snapback so Levi jeans PBR and bar CDs
 this is seriously like
paradise don't leave
I highlight conveniently miss my flight
music in headlights I've died in the
smoke from a river bank side a pretty
girl and a picket line like a we shade
up probably everyone watching me pause
right now sings really funny but yeah
that was my morning routine in Cancun
thank you guys so much for watching I'll
see ya next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
