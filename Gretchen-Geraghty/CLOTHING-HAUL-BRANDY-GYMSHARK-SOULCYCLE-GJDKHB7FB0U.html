super exciting home video for you guys I
just have a bunch of clothes from gym
short my formal dress and some other
miscellaneous clothes so without further
ado let's get on into it so if you like
I don't even have to tell you guys about
your pajamas you already know how much I
love them has the best workout clothes
by far they're literally such good
quality and so affordable and one of my
goals this summer is to make more
frequent haul videos so that they don't
have to be like these massive ones but
literally I have so many clothes so I'm
gonna make this part snappy this isn't
in any particular order but I just got
this blue sports bra so freakin cute in
the same color and material I got it in
like the tank top it's like dry fit and
so good when I get really sweaty from
running and biking before I forget to
mention that Jim shark will be linked
down below it'll be in the first line in
description so you can easily find it
I'm so thankful that I'm able to partner
up with them and work with them because
it's literally a dream come true and if
you guys go through my link to buy
different products on their website
it'll just help for me so I appreciate
that so much guys and you guys are my
other gyms are called videos I got this
heathered red like dry material short
sleeve shirt and I think of the tank top
as well and now I just got it in the
long-sleeve and then they came out with
these cropped long sleeves which I'm
like oh and these are specially so good
when you workout with high waisted
leggings which I love working out in and
then also in this light purple color
which is seriously to die for and this
is like the prettiest light lilac with
that reminds me in this pile somewhere
here it is so I actually wear this to
the gym website I just have to like dig
it out of my hand pretty showed you guys
it's this beautiful log and a light
purple tank-top it just says gym shark
it's mesh in the back it's just really
good when you're all sweaty and you can
kind of see your sports rep feeding
through I just got this long-sleeve a
cross hoodie actually my last from shark
haul video I have it in like a mint
green color too and these are my new
favorite leggings okay for those of you
that watch me for a while know that this
is like one of my favorite colors as
well just like the Heather looking kind
of muted colors are just so pretty to me
they fit so well they're like thicker
and have cute little like scented
details at the bottom and I also got
them in a dark grey and you know I'm
means can't wait to wear these I've been
wanting to wear more like matching sets
when I go to the gym because I don't
just a really fab and like a cute little
version of like Nikki black header or
like with these Simmons you guys know
you feel me I got this sports brought in
these leggings and they definitely go
together
I feel gonna make me work on my abs too
cuz you're absolutely poking out a
little bit between your sports bra do
like you see what I think like you and
yeah it's just like a bunch of different
shades of blue as you can tell and it's
more like turquoise in the back the
sports bra is the same like there's
little openings in the front of the back
to I think it's really cool I like can't
wait about you guy just like well and
then I got this sports bra as much
perfectly a pair of fit leggings I have
for men that are like the teal and like
turquoise blue and I got this gray tank
top that just says Jim shark like that
and it cuts like sideways at the bottom
and I swear I've seen Nikki black header
wear this so like obviously I love it
then I got this jacket it's just like
really nice thick like athletic sock
material it's maybe blue it just zips up
the reason I'm obsessed with it is
because the hood is show saying it just
says Jim shark like that in really big
letters so if you like put up your hood
you just look really really fresh and
then I got this other black jacket with
a bunch of like mesh details and I
really like this logo right here I'm
pretty sure a lot of their logos look
like that I'm like a lot of their
clothes but I don't know this one just
looks cool and then again with the
purple Jimmy shark just gets me it's
this really pretty darker purple color
and this was a really cool material it's
like really stretchy I love the mesh
back stuff oh and in this cropped
long-sleeve yes
actually I might use you read this this
afternoon because I just can't wait to
try this one out it's like this soft
stretchy spandex material long sleeve
with the reason I love this is because
there's cutouts my elbows and again high
it won't feel like Nikki black header
because I saw in one of her blog she was
wearing a cropped long-sleeve shirt that
was open and that all those and I was
then I know I have this exact shirt in a
blue color but I just got it in the mint
green one it's like scoop neck a little
bit tighter I got this gray best hoodie
thing losing I were talking out how
unique and like different this is right
Lee I'm talking about the Greg best
hoodie thing isn't it so cool it is like
me wait Lucy I'm gonna tell them what we
were talking about my senior year of
high school what did I do
uh-huh I have this sweatshirt and I
thought it would be really cool by like
I made a new best just like this so I
caught up the sleeves and we're over
like long sleeves rowing and everyone's
like that girl's so weird so really I
just needed this vest back then it's
just like this lighter kind of
breathable material with a hood and then
the back is like really open which is
cool and it's like open on the sides
then I just have three days of lessons
left we are these same ones I didn't
even realize Lucy if I have the same
pair of two Logging's wanna pair so I
think these are the same ones but
basically they're just like this really
cool grey and black print yeah I like
them and then in the same material these
ones are so pretty
they're just like this purple blue black
print and yeah these are just awesome I
can't wait to run around in these and
look at really fresh that is all I got
from Jimmy shark once again is linked
down below first line in description box
can't miss it we can be twins you guys
can get some really cool we're gonna
barrel that's affordable and a me
okay that's all that's my spiel on Jimmy
shark for the day oh this I just
randomly three over here I got this I
mean what's a cog it's Burberry perfume
it's called my Burberry is that all that
it's called I think just this rollerball
perfume it smells so good and there oh
yeah yeah just smelling it I was gonna
tell you guys the only reason I got this
is because of my friend Abbi I love you
I miss you so much but she always wears
this perfume I was like Abbi I'm copying
you because I really like your perfume
smells really good and then that way I'm
gonna write with you I'll remember you
and I wear it or fight you smell it no
I'm gonna put it on right now
cuz I miss Abby and it'll just make me
think of her and Abby's really bad so
obviously this is it's really good you
guys should get it oh and also I ordered
and√∂ which I'm not even explaining you
guys already know it's my favorite F
ever for shopping they just have like
every single store you can imagine it's
freaking amazing one also I guess I
should just mention in this video I
actually this is so excited I've been
turning within the summer which is
literally a dream come true because you
guys know that they've been my favorite
app like forever I'm freaking out I was
actually like fine lines yesterday I'm
just so blessed and so have you got a
Kotori for them so yeah they're like the
best app ever and obviously I'm gonna
even think more highly than because I'll
be working for them you know what I mean
but yeah so I ordered that perfume from
doe and it came like super quick it was
really convenient I'm right ordered to
and I was like half asleep and I was
like bye and that's why doe it's so good
because it's so convenient like it
remembers your shipping information your
credit card you just like purchase and
then you get it in couple days so that's
really why I love it the most I think if
you guys haven't used dough before if
you use my code Gretchen you can get
five dollars off is that what it is and
free shipping I haven't talked about the
code in a while but I think that's what
it is yeah definitely go use that weight
this I also ordered on Jo oh my gosh
okay so this is the dress I come for my
alfie formal and I brought Lucy is my
date and you guys already saw not on
this channel I think in my blog Channel
we had like our little outfi formal vlog
oh it's rumor ball and remember it's a
brand and BD literally the only reason I
got this is cuz my friend Sal she was
just telling me that she was looking
under balm and she's like rushing like I
found this dress and I think it would
look so good on you and I was like
really
okay it's beautiful I'm getting it and
it was like literally perfect so I think
stell wouldn't have gotten without you a
little goes super deep in the front and
has lethal chopper detail but also it's
like the thickest like nicest material
this is the first dress I've had from
nvg but Estelle said like all of her
dresses are from MBD and she like loves
them so I trust her they're really good
with sizing too because this is a small
and it fit me like perfect and she says
up those sizes are like so great like
she always knows she's like the same
size so yeah it's just like super cute
and I'm obsessed and it's a little
pricey but NVD dresses are just like
amazing so like it's very very worth it
and if I can find the link to that I
will link it down below for you guys
then you guys know I'm obsessed with
SoulCycle literally all of these things
are like my life and just like what I'm
so obsessed with no this videos me so
much like Gretchen why can't you shut
I've been obviously buying so much stuff
from SoulCycle
some of it's not even in here have I
even showed this stuff yet did I show
these I got them whoa
I don't know but I feel like I might
have shown it's just this long-sleeve if
this is really embarrassing if I already
show this in a haul video before but
whatever it's just like medium blue long
sleeve it just says SoulCycle right
there and it's actually from the men's
section but I'm like okay it's really
cute I don't care I really like buying
men's stuff because this sleeves are
super long they're like longer than in
women stuff and my arms are really long
so like men's shirts like fit me better
cuz they're so long and I'm like very
lanky and mom and this chain saw I don't
think I showed it in a home video but I
know I wore it in my queue day and it
just says soul human it's a muscle tank
and then this did I took this - this is
me embarrassing embarrassed
it just says Austin right there or like
pstn why why do they abbreviate that
it's only missing two letters if it was
Bo sto and then we just feel it forward
you know what I don't know oh then it
just says sole sole on the sleeve over
here like a plain black crewneck and
these are my favorite type of
sweatshirts ones that don't have the
Hutt's cuz i don't know why i just think
they're like comfortable and easy to
throw on
then I think I only have one thing is
your guys remember I might have got
other stuff honestly
remember this I've been wanting so bags
I've been like seeing it around like
Instagram and just like people up bu had
it and it's just this light yellow
cropped waffle shirt that's like
long-sleeve and it's just like so
comfortable and so cute it looks like so
good with the tan I did it got a pretty
tan right now so just got back from
Zanzibar so every tan there and I just
feel like this oh then this I turn the
pile because I haven't officially like
halted and Sam if you're watching this
thank you so much for picking these up
for us Sam Sophie me Louisa and Abbi all
wore these on Marathon Monday and they
were so perfect we looked so patriotic
and so cool I just love like the
patriotic look for the festive stuff
like that
so this was like so cheap like American
Apparel had this like huge sailor I
don't know if they're going out of
business or whatever we actually can
want to be comment down below and tell
me if they are going out of business cuz
I don't know if they are or they're just
having like a really big sale yeah it's
just like obviously just stars on the
front and then the stripes around the
back and we thought it was like a crop
top but it like literally like a
bralette and I think it was like legit
two or three dollars so this is so cute
and so perfect for like patriotic
festive things I wasn't going to show
these in a haul video because I'm
posting on Instagram with them but this
store shot priceless like reached out to
me and was like I wanna try out some
clothes sure and I've never even heard
of them and I'm like never even heard of
them before but they have such cute
stuff and like this dress is my new
favorite dress I'm so obsessed with it
it was the same outfit for my blog my
blog channel cuz this is what I wore
while I was getting ready and when I
went to dry bar oh my gosh I remember
that snapchat like a million screenshots
so I think you guys really liked this
dress for my hair both or I don't know
I'm just like obsessed with this dress
it's so cute it's like this thicker kind
of like sweat reading material but it's
like not that like fuzzy on the inside
it's more looking Jersey material and it
just like laces up in the front like
that I love like the lace up detail and
this I thought was so different and so
unique it's honestly beautiful and going
to a wedding next weekend and I'm gonna
wear this to cabinets yeah enough to
show you so it's kind of like a romper
maxi dress mix I don't really know but
you can tell on better it's just like
long it would just be like a normal
romper but then I was like the dress
like back on it I don't even know I
described it and I thought
like deep in the front as well and I
want some vertical stripes - I feel like
they're slimming I'm not totally sure
but the website must be pretty
affordable as well if their name is cha
priceless so I think it is and again if
I can find the links for these I will
link them down below for you guys and I
got this short sleeve black mesh
bodysuit I just love wearing these black
mesh Techcon exudes cooking but look
different for a lots of it I'm you can
just style them so many different ways
only and actually I don't think I ever
showed you guys my Miami sweater that I
got when I was in Miami with Mandy I
don't even know where it is right now to
show you guys but here's just like a
clip of me wearing it in a vlog and I
just love it super comfy so yeah I think
