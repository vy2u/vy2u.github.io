Paris right now if you couldn't tell I'm
just gonna chill and hang out with you
guys and tell you about this really cool
new website I came across it's called
fashion past and they actually are a
subscription like clothing accessory
like rental service and I absolutely
love their website I actually found out
about it through people and friends that
I know use it and they love it and they
just look like so stylish every month
and I don't know about you guys but I
actually remember in high school and a
phase where like I couldn't wear the
same clothes more than once which is
like it's so crazy like you can do that
but I know especially like for events
and stuff especially since I'm an elf
the FPU and just like different new
YouTube events and so if I go to like
it's really hard to wear the wear like
really fashionable like edgy clothes
more than once because you know you take
a couple pictures you post on Instagram
and you don't really want to wear it
again so yeah that's just like one
reason I really like fashion pass what I
think is like so different and unique
about it is that you can just pick like
different levels of plans based on like
how many clothes that you want to get
each month how many you want to be able
to like rent out at one time if that
make sense and it's actually like
unlimited so right as you get it if you
wear it once send it back you can get a
new package right away it's actually
free shipping both ways as well oh and
also what I really like is last time
this is my second box I'll show you guys
today
because I actually brought my first box
to Paris at the last time and you guys
know I was here fittings giving and Lucy
Amy got to wear their dresses out to
Nobu we took a bunch of pictures in them
and again like those are really fancy
like nice fashionable dresses that I
mean if they sat in our closets we
probably wouldn't wear them that much
again so it was really cool to go to
read them and if you guys to have used
my coat down below your first month will
be $29 which is like seriously so cheap
for like all the clothes you'll be
getting and wearing and like honestly so
worth it I feel like nowadays like my
closet is literally filled with clothes
that I like don't wear anymore wait what
was I even saying oh yeah so we weren't
those dresses to Nobu and that was like
my first box they were so cute I know
mine was from NBD it's like one of my
favorite dress brands I know they
haven't revolved and then Lucy do you
remember what yours was friend
I think Lucy's might have been NBD to
some of my favorite brands on there are
Free People
NBD show me your muumuu oh my gosh so
cute there's honey punch there for
loving lemons oh my gosh so cute after I
got that first box I actually got
for Paris and I just threw everything in
a box and what I really like this is a
house getting to is that it's like
obviously free shipping oh you said but
you don't have to wash them either like
you just send them back because once you
send them back they just dry clean them
so yeah my second box I actually ordered
like right before I came to Paris this
time cuz you guys know I'm on winter
break now from bu and shipping came so
quick like literally in a couple days
all my stuff came right in time for me
to come to Paris which is so nice now I
have some really nice awesome like
statement cool dresses and I've been
dinner tonight with though you guys know
a brand now Latasha my work with pushes
now figure it in there Oh another thing
I wanted to mention so this is so cool I
just think fashion past it's honestly
such a great idea for you guys and you
care about like fashion and clothes are
just like me literally living in excess
and having a closet full of clothes that
you either don't wear anymore you
already worn and not to say that you
can't wear things more than once
obviously but you know when you have
like relief statement dresses such as
this whatever oh my gosh I'm rambling on
so long I need to look into the video
and what I really want to which I'm all
over the place sorry
so I'm actually between sizes I'm really
between look at small and medium and I
never really know but there's a stylist
on fashion paths that you can actually
chat they will literally like try on the
clothes for you and just like give you
suggestions on what size you can be a
different you know brands that they have
on there and if you like had no idea
what you wanted that month you really
can just chat with them and kind of talk
about what you're going for what look
you're going for they can help you find
like pieces for events you have like
really cool dresses so okay like
literally I just blab it on for so long
term with this oh okay this is probably
my favorite thing that I got though I
got like I said honey punch I love honey
punch guys I love their robbers and
dresses jumpsuits this is a star
jumpsuit like how Q is this I'm obsessed
it just like ties up at the top I might
actually wear this tonight because it's
quite chilly in Paris if I wear this
it's obviously long and have legs and
everything I do despair like a leather
jacket I think would look really cute
some booties so adorable it's black with
little stars see like and then this is a
medium but then this that I got from 411
lemons is a small yep it's just like
this really fun black roughly off the
shoulder with gold polka dot dress and
it just
highs in the front right there a little
bow I feel like it's very holiday for
like you know Christmas dinner my family
or even like New Year's or anything
because you're so like shiny and fun and
unique and different like this is
obviously a such a statement piece in my
opinion like you don't see this every
day you wouldn't wear this every day
well let's show you some accessories
okay so these earrings I'm actually so
excited that I got I like that liquid
fashion pass you can be really daring
you know because it's stuff that you're
gonna rent you're gonna wear as long as
you want and then return it and actually
I know if you really really like
something you can keep it which is so
nice and you will just pay 80% of the
retail price and not even a hundred
percent of retail price so that's so
nice so you feel like a twenty percent
discount and hearing they'll try out for
you guys right now because I'm so
excited about them I feel like really
trending stuff sometimes I get look
scared of and I won't like try I won't
try out new trends because I'm like oh I
don't know if I like it you know but
what's so great fashion about us and you
can like be daring and try stuff and if
you don't like it it's fine you just
send it back and get something new Oh
aren't they so cool you like them the
alarm to dinner tonight see like these I
just didn't even think we're me but like
there's so me they're so fun I love the
color you do not like okay I'm keeping
them on for the rest of the video you
look at that I never knew I would like
you so much oh my gosh I might have to
just oh these guys are just gold that
dangly star earrings these are so
adorable
and I already know that like look at you
can just tell these would look so cute
and I'm so excited to wear these as well
so I've really been into a mixing like
my metals as far as jewelry like silver
and gold and I always used to just wear
silver like CDs or silver but then I got
my gold
Ramez bracelet and I have a silver and a
gold cardi a like wedding band I just
stack them on top of each other because
I really just like the way the stacked
look looks and then I have another
silver bracelet here so I love wearing
like silver and gold together and I feel
like he used to not be able to do that
and now I'm like let's defy the norm
people because that looks so good
together
it's okay definitely I just decided I'm
wearing this
like this because I love just like
blending them all together like I think
it looks so cool so this bracelet is
adorable
okay so that was like the little
accessories like jewelry oh you guys
know Planet blue this is just a really
cute cropped little wrap top ties in the
front this is really cool shiny like
ribbed pink material so this obviously
is so adorable and I really enjoy this
and this is so fun okay
I feel like overall overall dresses or
becoming such a thing Tasha just got
like the black cutest overalls ever so
this is just like a black little overall
dress like a skirt at the bottom it like
cuts really low DP guys know I like that
show me your mama know guys I just I'm
obsessed with them I feel like their
style of clothes is so me and I just
look so fun and this is just a double
act dress with some red flowers this is
just really cute so yeah I would so
recommend using passion pass because it
can get so expensive of buying these
brands all the time for your clothes
because they literally get so expensive
you guys know like three people for 11
lemons and everything but it's just so
worth your money with fashion pass
because when you're spending the money
to rent the clothes every month you're
getting like a limited rental thank you
so much fashion pass for working with me
on this video because I'm obsessive your
website they're like a new at company
guys but seriously I'm like obsessed
with the idea of them and for sure I'll
be using them in the future I know the
next box I'll get is actually I'm going
to be in Paris for the next like seven
days or so and then when I get home I
will be able to send back all these
clothes super easy to fashion pass and
then two days after that I'll be able to
pick out my next box so I'll probably be
picking out some really fun items for
New Year's oh and last thing I wanted to
mention also is that it is like not
binding at all the membership you can
cancel or like pause at any time so like
if you have a bunch of events the next
month and you think you'll want like new
clothes obviously you can like pick out
a bunch of new closes normal and then if
the month after that if you're you know
sitting around not going to as much
stuff or you just feel like you have so
many clothes or whatever you can pause
your membership for that month so you
don't have to get anything don't pay and
I think that's really nice that they're
not trying to like lock you in or like
take all your money you know I mean yeah
thank you so much for watching this
video and I'll see you next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
