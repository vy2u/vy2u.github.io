little try on home video for you guys
I've been really just into shopping
lately like what am i not and I also
have some more clothes coming but I just
could not wait to film what I have for
you guys like right now and then it'll
probably be another client home video
coming soon in the next couple of weeks
I know I ordered a bunch of more shoes I
read some clothes from forever 21 so
that is coming but today we have some
stuff from Urban Outfitters American
Eagle Windsor store Tory Burch so yeah
let's just get on into it so the first
time I'm going to be showing you is
actually all from this app that's on
your phone called oh and I know I've
talked about the dote shopping app I
think twice in my haul videos before but
it's because it's seriously amazing this
isn't sponsored by them or anything but
I seriously just want to tell you if you
haven't seen my other videos where I
talked about them that it's just such a
good app for shopping online I ordered
like all this stuff from urban these
sandals from American Eagle which I'm
about to show you but yeah basically joe
is just a shopping app that has like
every store that I shop on on there so
it's so nice and like so convenient to
buy all my stuff in one place instead of
having to buy it like online on my
computer like separately you know what
I'm saying
also if it's your first time using go if
you don't have an account yet if you use
my code Gretchen you get five dollars
off of your first order so it seriously
just like a five dollar gift card to
anywhere you want and I'm pretty sure
your free shipping too so it's honestly
amazing and I get like all my clothes
off over there now unless I like go
shopping like at a mall because it's
just so much more convenient to get it
all from all these different stores like
in one a little app so yeah so the first
thing I got from do't but they're
actually from American Eagle or just
these brown sandals and I don't know if
you guys have seen me wear these before
I did actually have these but I lost
them at a concert like don't even ask
kinda like one fell off it was like a
mosh pit of people cuz I couldn't find
it so those are just gone plus they were
really old and like this part got really
stretched out so I just loved them when
I loved how they were just like simple
and basic but you can also dress them up
or dress them down and they're comfy
luckily American Eagle was still selling
them so I was like yes any other pair of
shoes I got also through the dough
shopping app Tory Burch is on the dope
shopping app which is so nice and I just
got these sandals which I seriously I've
been wanting for so long guys like
they're just beautiful and then my
friend Ann Marie lovely girl she was
wearing them in LA and I was like that's
it like I need them and she's funny how
much she loves them
so I just got these brown leather
sandals they're way different from those
other brown flip-flops I just showed you
because those are my more casual in the
dark leather and stuff but these are
like nice sandals and I'm just so happy
that I got these because I wanted them
for so long and then just this lighter
brown leather and they're so cute and
comfy and I just love them and then the
rest of the stuff I got through the Joe
shopping app is from Urban Outfitters
and the first thing I got is just this
kale t-shirt which is seriously so cute
it's just gray this is Kailen green
letters unless he has it in navy blue so
I just was like yes like I didn't even
know that I'm never in color but I was
like I need it and me and Lucy can't win
and I just I just love this oh and if I
didn't say everything in this hall will
be linked down below so definitely check
that out because he takes me awhile so I
put all the links down there and then if
you like anything you can get the same
thing as me and we can't win it'll be
great and the next thing I got from
Urban Outfitters I actually wore
yesterday when I went to a waterfall
with Justin it was really fun it just
says green tank top that like buttons on
the front and it's just really really
really soft like stretchy material so
comfy and I actually saw in the store
and I was like I don't know if I really
need it but I was like no look it's so
comfortable and cute and those of you
that know me best know that when I like
something I have to get it in more than
one color so I also just got it in this
white color and I haven't worn it yet as
you can see it would like the text align
but I mean it breeds long island with me
this weekend and I know we're there and
then I just got this dress which I've
been wanting it for so long and I just
love it it's this beautiful royal blue
color you guys know I just look royal
blue and it has these beautiful designs
all over it
it comes up really hot in the neck it
just looks so cute but my favorite part
is actually the back how it's all open
like that
you can just see your back like with
that one strap in the middle it just
looks so cute and the only complaint I
have about this which I'm so sad about
was that it was okay I don't want to say
how expensive it was a pretty expensive
dress but I got it and then I noticed a
couple days later when I saw it online
that it went on sale if this always
happens to you does this happen to you
guys when like you buy stuff it's really
cute and you just love it and then right
after you buy it it goes on sale and
you're like why it's so annoying so yeah
that was just 20 dollars cheaper so
definitely go check it out now and then
the next things I have to show you are
from Lululemon
and they actually do have Lululemon on
the dope chopping up but I just got
these at the mall the other day with
Justin I'm wearing them right now but as
you can see me trying them on they're
just the high-waisted wonder Anders and
I just love these because I have a
million pairs of just the plain black
wonder editors and I was like you know I
should get the high-waisted one so I can
write with like shorter t-shirts like I
am right now cuz this is a more like
cropped like shorter shirt so it's like
perfect for that they're just really
comfy and cute and when I realize guys
is that so I'm a size 4 in the ones
runners from little lemon and they like
fit me perfect in some of mine that I've
had for a while or even getting big
because they like stretch it out do your
guys it's like a stretch out too because
these are like tight like they're like
really really tight fitting but my other
four leggings aren't so yeah just
haven't you guys to this is just opening
time including the lemon cuz I haven't
in a while and it's so funny when you
guys comment on all videos you're like
oh my gosh like what's the GLB haul
video without Lululemon and it always
makes me laugh so these are for you guys
some little lemon then I got a bunch of
stuff from a winter store and I
seriously just love winter store they
just have the cutest stuff and I just
love it so I'll have all these things
linked down below as well and the first
thing I have to show you is it so funny
and human when I saw it online I
literally just arted bursting out
laughing like I just love it and it's
just this great t-shirt it says I've
mixed drinks about feelings and I just
think that is so funny and it reminds me
of my friend Hannah yeah I just love it
it's really comfortable to the next help
I got is just this maroon v-neck that
has all these little like distressed
holes all over it you guys now I
actually have it in the dark grey color
but I loved it so much that I have to
get it in different colors so I really
like this and the next things I have to
show you are actually this set and I am
obsessed I just thought of mine I
thought it looked so comfortable and it
was even better when I got it like in
person because I am not kidding guys
this is like this softest material I've
ever felt it is just so soft and so
comfy it is just this little like sort
of cropped
hoodie that's just this green color so
comfy and then it comes with the green
fuzzy matching shorts and these are a
little more high-waisted so it just
looks so cute together and I seriously
love it like you can wear it to bed
honestly I'll probably wear it out
like where to the mall are like okay is
there something cuz I just love it and
the next thing I got from Windsor stork
is just this black bodysuit and it's a
long-sleeved and it's more like a
thicker like knit material and I just
love the back up crisscross is like that
I feel like I've been really into criss
cross key things recently like
everything I get it just has these like
little Criss crosses and it is just so
cute and I also like that it's a bit
thicker so I can definitely transition
it into the fall and like winter instead
of like shorts or skirts you could wear
it with like high-waisted pants tights
with a skirt stuff like that and the
last thing I got from Windsor store is
just this black bomber jacket and I told
Lucy we can share and I knew she'd be so
excited because she's been wanting a
black bomber jacket like this and they
seriously soak you on it like bomber
jackets for them I tried it on I really
really liked it and I think you can
dress this up or dress it down too I
like how it's just black so it literally
will go with like everything oh I also
got these two things which I forgot I
threw in here to show you guys Lucy and
I win makeup shopping with our grandma
the other day cuz she was here visiting
she got us to makeup it was so nice of
her I just got this L'Oreal Paris magic
skin beautify or BB cream in medium and
I show this in one of our vlogs because
I was just amazed by the way if you
don't subscribe to this is my blog
Channel you definitely should just type
in on YouTube Gretchen and Lucy go
subscribe I'll have a link down below as
well but anyway I was talking about this
in my blogs because I was like amazed I
can't believe how well this works
because it just comes out white but then
it like blends into your skin perfectly
like it literally turns a color of your
skin and I just like couldn't even
believe it like I'm wearing it right now
and I just feel like it has like the
perfect amount of coverage and yeah I'm
just obsessed and I just feel like this
also a lot of you like to comment on
some of my videos sometimes saying that
I have like not good eyebrows or
whatever but it's really just because I
never like do anything to my eyebrows me
being good with my eyebrows is
remembering to like pluck them once a
month but recently I was like okay I got
to get my eyebrows on fleek like I broke
am not good so I got this Maybelline
brow define in filthy woah this I just
really really like I've been using in
the past couple of days and I just know
I like it already
cuz it like matches my eyebrow color
perfectly because towards the end my
eyebrows just get a little sparse and
before this the only thing I would
really ever do in my eyebrows when I was
like really trying to do my makeup well
is use this like tinted brow gel but
this is like even better so I definitely
would recommend these two products so
yeah I guess that is everything
to show you in this haul video and
thumbs up this video if you like trying
homes because I like them too thank you
guys so much for watching and I'll see
you my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
