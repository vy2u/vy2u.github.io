because I didn't you have no idea you're
Emily Gretchen where are you right now
I'm sitting on the ground in the
bathroom I'm trying to be pretty quiet
because a lot of people are still
sleeping so I just thought I would come
in here really quick and start the day
off I think me and Maggie are gonna go
to Starbucks soon try to like upload
videos or whatever but I just thought I
would get this started because I'm so
frickin pumped for this weekend and I
wanted to show you something really
exciting that my waiting to show me do
you hide your mom when I first said that
quiz on carob and I did like my um I
don't my preferences like I said I
wanted like vitamins elbow promote
energy and like like healthy skin stuff
like that digestive like products I
think I might bloated and stop so I
probably got my little vitamins that I
brought a bunch of them here at you at
Palm Springs with me and just so that I
can take them this weekend and I feel
like everyone else's can be getting sick
and guess who's not gonna be getting
sick me didn't have my vitamins to keep
me healthy because people get so sick
from Coachella they get like the
Coachella play because you like inhaling
dust and dirt and whatever but yeah
these are just my dreams I got my look
quiz I'm so excited started taking them
cuz you guys know I like talked about
taking by their hands before and I just
felt really stressed about like not
knowing what might have been sitting and
whatever so yeah it just says hi
Gretchen in today's question if you
could have a dinner with one person
living or dead who would it be
these are just like a cute little things
they have on there so yeah I have a
bunch of vitamins in here I know some
are
digestive enzymes which I'm super
excited about because I saw in Maggie's
video and she was trying them she said
that I wasn't even taking them she
hasn't been bloated and I'm so excited
like it especially for Coachella that
can be so nice because who wants to be
bloated it like being tiny little skimpy
outfits are gonna be wearing you know so

reading I'm I have the booklet like out
in our room but there's like a booklet
that shows all the little pills you got
I'm like what they do and what they
promote and stuff and one of them
especially I'm so excited for it
promotes a healthy bone now which I know
it like probably not a lot of people are
thinking of but um actually back when I
was doing my weight remind my
nutritionist recommended that are not
recommended she just said that I'm like
pretty Thomas you proces just from being
so small and having like a little body
fat and I didn't get my period for a
while - I don't know if I like told you
guys about that I think I mentioned it
before so I'm happy that I can take
something that was kind of like
counteract that or help with my bone now
