really good and it was really fun to
film so it's so hard doing those types
of videos and like these small little
mirrors cuz I don't really know how my
makeups turning out but oh boy it's
gonna have to go looking like a big
mirror inside um I've been kind of bad
at like vlogging this morning but
basically I've just been trying to get
my stuff together figure out what I'm
gonna wear and I didn't really know
basically I have this like white
swimsuit top on basically right now
because I was gonna wear what oh you
think it to look good on me Thanks um I
was gonna wear this like caged like holy
top from lft and it's like such a
Coachella top so I feel like I had to
wear it but then I was like I don't know
cuz I like didn't really like any
bottoms I could wear thick so I wanted
to do like an all-white outfit but then
Maggie is like wearing an all-white
outfit right now that she has like an
option and I think I'm gonna wear hers
today and she's gonna wear her all-black
one and it's like these long flowy like
dusters with like mine's like a body see
what underneath and hers I think she
wears like a swimsuit underneath but so
they would like kind of go together and
then she'd be all black and I bill white
so that'd be really cool so I figure try
that on but then I feel bad if I don't
wear that llf top I don't know man I
don't know and we're trying to drink as
much water as possible because it's like
super easy get dehydrated definitely are

saw him for like 15 minutes and felt
like they were like seeing to my soul

vibing out so hard and I left my bag
open and I was like sitting around like
vlogging so my phone legit fell out of
my little bag and me and now you're
