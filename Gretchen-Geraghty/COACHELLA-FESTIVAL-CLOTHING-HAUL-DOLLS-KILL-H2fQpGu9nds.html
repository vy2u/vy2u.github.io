comedy for you guys it is all from my
dolls Kayla I've loved all kill for so
long like I used to order wild fox which
was something all the time they've so
many of my favourite brand so no further
ado let's get into it
sorry the lighting is weird right now -
I have a ring light right here with my
bit like a wrong angle I just don't even
know what I'm doing just I'm trying my
best
I got this really cute light pink top
like that it's just stretchy and the
reason I really like this is because
it's like satiny on the bottom and like
silky so I kept so cute and then I got a
similar type top that's just like white
but then the bottom isn't like satin
your silky it's just like this white
fabric Oh than this I love so they have
a bunch of like I would say festival
type stuff like it definitely pushes me
out of my comfort zone which is why I
love dolls kill and so I got this black
bralette which i think is so adorable
and I'm actually going to Coachella this
year I don't know if I've talked to you
guys that much about it but this is
gonna be so perfect for Coachella so I
love that then I got these red
high-waisted pants they're by the brand
rehab and other stuff is like such good
quality these are just really cool like
red high-waisted trousers Auriga type
okay them these black shorts are so cool
guys
they're velvet high-waisted black little
shorts that kind of lace up and down the
front so these are so fun I mean so like
edgy I feel these are also really really
edgy these are just some camo pants to
read the brand k - and I'm so small and
they just cinch at the waist and they're
like long camo joggers and I love cam up
you guys know I had to like camo
sweatshirts and then these are just
really cool because I like know what
Kate okay is really so I love those
these are also like trendy and edgy and
fine this I thought was so cute like
this is me so perfect for like Coachella
or like any music vessel really it's
just as denim little like cultures that
we'd call it like crop top for all that
type thing so that's really fun I think
I'm like really moving through this but
I just like love it all it's all so cute
this is my blue blush it's a white
bodysuit it's just like ribbed up
it down ties in the front super cute oh
and I also bet it ties at the top I
think that's really adorable wow I'm
really grating it through this video
I've been going so quick this is very
unlike me because I'm usually very
chatty but this is my brand k2 as well
and I smell
they're just these like leathery
high-waisted shorts
oh here's the little belt so I like ties
I really like high-waisted things so I
like those these are probably my
favorite favorite thing that I got out
of all of dolls kill stuff they're just
these black like close to a booties
they're by the brand
machan is that it let me see em ACK ing
j-mac Inge I don't know I love the most
is that they just have like these silver
circle studs all over them I think these
are so fun and these just like you know
you're gonna see me in these I Coachella
just like these are gonna be so perfect
and I know that Coachella you have to
wear closed toed shoes and it's like in
the desert or your feet would be like so
sandy and dirty okay and then the last
two things that you guys from dolls kill
these are just these face gems in silver
and they just like I don't know if you
can see they go like right there above
like your eyebrows and these are just
gonna be like so cool oh and then they
have the two little ones like the inner
corners of your eyes and this is really
hard to hold up but I'll just show it to
you on it's just like this gold body
chain and has like these beautiful clear
like gems all over so sugar bestow upon
it to wear to a music festival it
doesn't even really have to be Coachella
yeah that's pretty much it thank you so
much for watching I'll see you next
