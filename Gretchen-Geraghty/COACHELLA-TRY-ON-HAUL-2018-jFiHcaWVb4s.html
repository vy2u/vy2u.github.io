filming a Coachella Albany for you guys
and I'm so excited to be showing you
everything that I got I've been waiting
a while because I've been picking up
some stuff
slowly but I'm literally so excited that
I'm going I don't know if I've talked
about it that much but I really cannot
wait to go and I'm actually going
without shopping you guys already know
about Joe obviously I was an intern
there over this summer on the internship
and I've worked with them on YouTube for
so long now you guys just already know
it's my favorite shopping I've ever
literally of all time because they have
all my favorite stores like literally
everything I'm gonna be showing you I
got from Joe so if you don't follow me
on there already definitely follow me on
joke my name is Gretchen Garrity
obviously and I know I always tell you
guys you can get like a $5 gift card
literally to any one of the stores on
there you can use it on like everything
it's just like credit that's applied to
your account and you can use code
Gretchen to get that if it's your first
time so yeah definitely use concussion
for five dollars off of like literally
everything on their app um but also
don't forget to follow me because I
don't know if you use my code does it
automatically follow me I don't know so
those of you that have used the code
before can you go check on do't right
now if you're following me because you
must be following me because I'm
actually going to start doing some
giveaways in the next couple of weeks I
know I'm gonna set one up during like
Coachella and yeah you got to be
following me to enter those giveaways
and then you'll see when I am doing them
so yeah make sure you follow me in dope
that's that about that first I'm gonna
show you stuff that I initially got for
Coachella and the rest of stuff is also
for Coachella but I wasn't initially
planning on getting and I was just
scrolling through do't the past like
week or so and I was like okay I need
these two so the first place I'm gonna
start off from is free people and this
brawl that I've been eyeing I think it's
so flippin cute and ever since I got it
I feel like I've been seeing so many
people wearing it I got Instagram and
stuff
I started trend I'm kidding um but I
actually I can't believe how is the tag
Stallone I wore it oh wait no I'm
messing this all up okay the first one I
got this is when I've been wearing I'm
actually wearing it right now you can
kind of see it through my shirt here
like as you can see in the Tryon it's
just this white really cute pretty
people brawl at and I liked it so much
that I just got it in this black one and
it just came in so that's why I haven't
ordered it
I'm so confused I know I want it but
it's cuz I've worn the white one and
then I got it in black and literally
these are just so cute I like them
because they're like longer so you can
wear them as like crop tops to you
obviously like really high waisted stuff
and like something over it or you can
wear it as like a bra let because I
think that's how it's like made for so
these are literally so cute and perfect
and like festival looking for Coachella
and what you do weekend one by the way I
don't know if I said that so literally I
leave a weekly today I'm so excited then
I got this duster and that's what it's
called like duster cardigan thing and
it's so adorable like obviously me
holding up does really show but it's
just like here I'll put it on because I
think it'll look cute right now it's
just like so long and cute and like
perfect ooh there we go
perfect for like the desert and I don't
know I just think it's so flowy and like
fun and cute and we'll look at with so
many outfits very like versatile I got
them I think it was black but it's
really like a dark grey and then what
else ok and then this is also something
else that I did initially get but um I
got this plea I'm like totally doing it
wrong you know what whatever I'm just
gonna do a Buy store because at first I
said I was gonna go in order of like
when I got stuff but I'm just gonna do
by store so this I recently got because
I think it's so cute from people this
I've actually wanted I feel like forever
because I've always wanted a lace um
bodysuit like this that like dips really
low and this is so cute it's just like
open in the back so obviously very
scandalous but you like wear it with
other stuff for like for going out
literally so cute fits so well and then
this is the most recent thing I got it
literally just came in the mail and I'm
so full lipping excited I just feel like
I've seen this on Instagram I saw it and
like was it free people's Instagram or
like I don't know I've just seen people
have it um
and I'm like I need that it's so
freaking cute why I just put it on so
weird anyway it looks like this like how
adorable is is I feel like it's so
different and not something I would like
normally wear like I don't have that
many jean jackets but they were like
really growing on me I really didn't
used to like them or I just like didn't
think they look good on me but now like
I love them and I think this is so cute
it's just free people kind of pricey but
I just thought it was like so adorable
and like I've never seen anything
good so that's why I really like that
and again it was on dope okay
then we'll go to Urban Outfitters I got
these black booties and I just saw these
and I was like whoa these like scream
Coachella
it's like black leather booties with
what are these called buckles on the
side and like pointed toes is it just me
or like whenever anyone says Coachella
Ulysse always like have a joke and say
it like I think it's the code eco vine
or AP vine I just thought about it but
um he's like are you going to Coachella
and that's all I think about when I hear
Coachella or say Coachella I just think
of it being stuff like that anyway so
these are for Coachella in their box
20 little booties and I saw they're
really fun and just very Coachella ask
then I got this black bandanna from
Urban Outfitters just to go like that or
like that and I just think it's so fun
in like festive looking very like
festival II and last year actually for
Marathon Monday I wore a black bandana
like this and I felt really baller so
yeah this one was special from Urban
Outfitters because it was called a
vintage black paint dinner which
actually like I know that sounds insane
like getting him playing by Dan on Urban
Outfitters I was like Christian you can
go to like any like craft store I feel
like and they have them but this one I
like it because it's like squishy and
like vintage looking like it's actually
worn out looking at more like soft and
then new ones you get her like really
stiff I know that's like not that big of
a difference
I just think its corners kind of like a
wrinkled looking anyway whatever I just
think it's cool then oh I went ham on
princess Polly I didn't realize how much
I love their stuff until I was just
looking through at all and I was like
dang so oh this okay this makes no sense
holding up but you guys saw me wearing
this when I was in Miami yeah Miami when
I just got back from Miami I wore this
there but really I got it for Coachella
because I think where we're staying has
like a pool so I had to get some like
swimsuits you know um and I guess you
could wear this maybe is a body suit
well probably not as you can tell like
in the Tryon and the pictures and stuff
it's quite revealing however I really
like it I think it's fun and different
and I'm getting into like one pieces you
know then from princess Polly I got this
white shorts
you sure that just ties my friend and
actually just watched you guys know my
best friend Maggie honey - now you
McDonald she got this in black and it
ties in front and I was like Maggie
you're so smart I don't even think of
getting in black book black it's like
really cute in bar - is what I'm trying
to say but I got it white it's really
cute I just love the things that like
tie in the front I'm about that vibe
right now then I got this yellow tank
top and I think Maggie wait a minute
Maggie I don't remember you showing this
in your whole video but in person you
showed me you got it
and I think she got this in blue or
maybe I'm making that up to shit in
white I really think she got it in baby
blue or was it Emma I think this comes
and make me blue but I just got this
like mustard a yellow color cuz I
thought I reminded me of the desert okay
oh this I forgot was from princess Polly
but oh yeah it is okay this I just
thought looked so fun on Joe and I was
like I need it look I don't have any
skirt like this it's white and I love
all the like tassels like fringy things
in the bottom I think they're so cool so
I love that white skirt then I got this
red crochet crop top this is just so
dang cute look at it like the sleeves
that go like that I'll imagine this
would like the white bra light
underneath and again it ties in the
front we're all about that tie action I
just really like tops it tie in the
front so that's adorable
and then this white top I think I wanted
it an all-black are all white but then
they didn't have it so I was like I'm
gonna be fun it gets polka dot one and I
don't really know if Pope gonna throw
like Coachella but I just thought it was
cute I probably won't wear this to
Coachella but I mean I don't know I just
think it's a cute little basic tank top
and it's fun um Lee I have a question
for you guys though I'm really bad at
putting outfits together honestly like I
can tell when I like like a piece like I
know I really like this bra for example
but then I don't know how to wear like
outfits together so from like what I'm
showing you if you guys have any great
ideas or like clothes that you know I
have if you have any really bright ideas
of outfits you think I should wear can
you please comment them down below
because I need your help like I
literally don't know how to put it
together I've been stressed about it
everyone's acquitting we're in Cochella
and I'm like I really don't know yet
like I gotta like figure out my life
but um yeah that's that oh and then what
else this
I don't even remember what store this
was from on Joe it's got to be like
revolver shop or something but basically
I'm done because so it's the below the
belt like iconic black belt with like
the double buckle and I've just seen
girls wearing this for so long my big
natty how is it like so many my friends
have it and I just think it's so
adorable um and I just feel like it's
like timeless like it's been a thing for
a while but also I feel like people have
been wearing it to Coachella it's like
2013 or never so I don't know if I
should wear it again plus I really can't
wear it again because I got a size
medium and it just doesn't fit me like
at all like it doesn't like it's just
way too big around my neck can you see
like it's just way too big around my
waist so I don't know why I was like
small like I'm scared like what if it's
too small like it it's called small so I
got a medium and it's okay I don't know
I don't know what I was thinking
basically it's too big maybe I can try
to exchange it or something but sorry I
don't think I came right back to
Coachella but it's cute though it's
really cute I really like it um okay
then oh these I'm so excited you guys
saw my Puerto Vallarta blogs with Tasha
basically I've been living under a rock
and I like never knew how amazing
Frankie's bikinis were and I always kind
of knew what they were because like
Tasha would talk about them or other
people would be like Oh Frankie
zucchinis are like the best but I was
like yeah I'm good with like my cheap
bikinis like you guys know it's all my
bikinis are from it's awful like they're
my favorite and I love them but then
when I was in print of my era I wore
bunch of Tasha's and I was like whoa
baby like these are a whole new ball
game they're just like really soft and
like super flattering I think actually
the ones I got her like a semi
flattering but the one that warned purr
is like I just be like looked so good
but the styles that she had her like
super popular like sold out and I
couldn't get them but anyway these I
believe are from revolve Ando because
they sell Franky's bikinis and this one
I was so excited about it's in like the
bandana-print
I don't know if I can tell you this
style name but I'm sure you can tell
just by me holding it up I forget what
it is but they're like super cheeky
bottoms or I say super I mean like look
at that literally like a dog however
they're really cute sorry dad and
they're really soft and then this top
style I really like as well it's just
like the straight-across top style with
like the
straight straps again I speak English is
hard sometimes I mean oh not I think I
know cuz I can see right here at the
little clasps you can take off the
straps too if you just wanted to make a
little banjo so I like that it's like
convertible and then this I really got
solely because it reminds me of Tasha's
black but this is like Tasha's red
bathing suit that I wore in a fire did
you guys know the picture of me with
like the crochet red top and like the
bottoms kind of have crochet on them too
and I love that but I just couldn't find
it anywhere
so this one I was like kind of similar
to it it's just like normal bathing suit
on the top in crochet on the bottom and
this is still so cute - and then the
bottoms that go with are just plain red
bottom yeah oh wait is that the runner
in the back wait I think I put them on
backwards no wait no I put them on right
okay these are like less cheeky than the
other one that because see the tag in
the back here like that's like more
coverage than the other one so anyway I
really like those as well
they're quite pricey but I don't know I
think it's where they excite where
bathing suit all the time and goes down
like always going somewhere warm or like
somewhere where I can swim my hair baby
dance so it's like were there for me cuz
they're really soft I like that oh by
the way I got all of them in a size
small and actually Tasha's like a
national you guys don't have tiny shoes
and I would wear hers and perta by era
de and I kind of like how little they
were because the tops result in my boots
but also I just like tight bathing suits
because then I don't feel like they're
gonna fall off and I feel like for me
bathing suits and Bowie's like when they
get wet I think they like kind of
stretch out and I like don't want them
and if you loosen their can fall so I
kind of like them tighter but anyway I
would just recommend going like your
size or maybe even a size down but Tasha
told me some run really small I don't
know and they're like super stretchy so
maybe just go with your size that's a
safe bet
okay then all of these I ordered I guess
are not really for Coachella and just
like my life but I feel like ever since
I've come into college I like lose
underwear I'm like missing underwear
like I don't know do you guys already
mean in socks - I feel like socks and
underwear just go missing and I always
have to buy them so I got literally so
many parents Rhonda right I didn't even
count but I just ordered like crazy I'm
Victoria Secret this is probably were to
show you but like whatever in some
I got like comfy big ones for sleeping
don't judge me
okay like these are cute comfy I got
this one I'll start with the bigger ones
Oh 8 that's fun um like mostly phones
because I mean I wear thumbs like in my
everyday life because I wear it tight
well I wear leggings most of the time so
then those have to be I have to write
songs then you know because the girls
you have underwear lines did I get
normal underwear I thought I did uh
maybe not
yeah I don't think maybe I did it
I don't know ZZ go I got a nude seamless
song this is so weird that I'm showing
right now another new song
another new thong like big black same
one grey with green don't worry this
isn't gonna be dried black like the same
other one with cool lace on the back
black again this one I thought was cute
like come on that's cute and it's like
blue into this pink the old royal blue
obsessed me would be screaming uhm
purple and purple this one's cute lookit
like that's pretty the colors I don't
know
blue cute and this color is cute too
so yeah wait I literally thought I got
so many granny granny panties to sleep
in and I just got what they're whatever
I got 14 pairs of underwear anyone needs
to borrow some let me know ok I think I
was pretty much except for the last
thing I pulled out to show you guys when
I was just in where was I
Oh Miami I got this mini little backpack
and I'm literally so obsessed with this
like just looking at it makes me happy I
wanted it for so long you guys don't
understand it's like literally oh the
reason I'm showing this is because I
think it's just like a cute little bag
and I like that it's a good backpack so
that I had like straps and don't lose it
so I think this will be good for a go
child you guys have any ideas if this
would be good or bad can you comment
down below and let me know because I
wouldn't wanted to get like dirty at
this and would like make it dirty or
something
but like since it's a little and like
secure on my back maybe it would be a
good thing to have so I don't know I
could use your opinions but yeah that
was everything to show you guys
definitely don't forget to follow me on
Joe and use kokachin for five dollars
off five dollar gift card like however
you think of it cuz that's really nice
but anyway thank you so much for
watching and I'll see ya next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
