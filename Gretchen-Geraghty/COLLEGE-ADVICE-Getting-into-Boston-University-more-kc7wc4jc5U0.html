college advice type of video and you
guys have been asking me questions for
so long just about college in general so
I've been waiting to film a video like
this where I just answer like a bunch of
your frequently asked questions about
like applying to college just general
questions about college experience so I
kind of tried to like touch on a bunch
of different topics all at once
I went through my thoughts yesterday and
I just made 10 little tips on my phone
that I'm going to discuss with you guys
and also I need to mention before start
this video this is actually a collab
video with my friend Brooke here on
YouTube you can attend bar down below
for her video she is also making a
college themed video for not already
subscribed work you totally should
because she is like the cutest person
ever she literally has her life together
if I like look up to her so much I'm not
kidding if you go on her Instagram she
always has the best Instagram themes and
for those of you that follow me on my
Instagram I just like always a mess
basically her instagrams for Victor
YouTube channels perfect she's perfect
go check out her bed okay
so tip numero uno is don't limit your
search too much for certain reasons I
definitely did this I limited my search
greatly based on like several factors
now looking back I wish that I didn't so
I just want to tell you guys to keep an
open mind if you're a senior of your
junior if you're a freshman in high
school whatever because you never know
where you're going to end up do your
research
search colleges for yourself if you
actually do that and open your on to
like a lot of different possibilities
then you'll end up somewhere you really
like I think focus on all the different
aspects you want out of a college
instead of just basing it off one
specific thing my second tip is that
SATs and a CTS really do matter and also
your GPA I don't know if that's how it
is everywhere but I'm pretty sure like
most people take the SATs it kind of
stinks that like our education system is
based off of these tests because I know
some people just aren't really good test
takers I think I've always been pretty
lucky with my exam I'm usually a pretty
good test taker I just test pretty well
but I just know like some of my friends
they're like the smartest people but the
whole concept of testing will stress
them out look I'm sure some of you
aren't the best at taking tests and
that's just like how some people are I
guess all I can say is really just study
is that you can and try your best maybe
get some tutors look I know I did some
SAT tutoring before I took mine and like
don't be afraid to take it more than
once I
I think that can go against you at all I
took my SATs three different times and I
ended up doing the best on my third time
I took it so practice probably does make
perfect do like a bunch of practice
exams I remember doing those my high
school even held like a PSAT so do those
guess just try your best on those
because colleges really do look at those
in your GPA matters so so so much my
freshman year of high school I didn't
realize that like starting day one
freshman year of high school that would
start counting towards my GPA that
colleges would see so if your freshmen
in high school really try hard you just
definitely have to try your best all
four years because that is going to be
the great at colleges see and that is
going to be a large part of your
acceptance my third tip is I kind of
touched on this before but really focus
on what you want out of a school inside
of the school itself for example be is a
city school and I knew that I wanted to
be in the city I just am a city type
person I love having so many things to
do and being with so many people I'm a
very like social person I wanted a big
school I knew that because I just wanted
to change from high school my high
school had like 2,000 kids and I just
wanted like a lot a lot of kids which is
cool because you see new people you
interact with new people every day and I
really like that some people aren't like
that it really just depends for everyone
like I know a lot of people can't handle
like a massive university like this you
just have to focus on what you want and
like limit your search that way also
another thing I thought of is think
about the expenses in high school I feel
like you don't really have a grasp for
like expenses and like loans and like
paying for college and after college and
all of that it's hard like especially
being so yeah but I guess just like ask
your parents for advice with money and
like see where your family stands on
sending you to college colleges that you
can definitely forward colleges that you
might not be able to afford like you
couldn't meet your search that way as
well and when you're in college think
about like potential expenses at the
college that you decide to go to living
in a city I'm pretty sure is more
expensive you'll be like going out a lot
like E and let go shopping on Newberry
for example so you just have to keep
that in mind for when you're going to
college because you don't want to be
like broke like I know like every
college student is broke so you just got
to kind of figure that out in life at
most colleges have like dining points
convenience points that type of thing
where you can use money on what your ID
card that you use at places on campus
and
bu you can use your dining points on
Domino's pizza delivery so life AK see
if your school has looked something like
that because you never know there's like
always really cool opportunities and
stuff for college students tip 4 is pay
attention to deadlines guys don't do
what I did I actually wrote my college
application the day it was due don't do
that look I had my common app like essay
done and everything but I had to write
my supplemental and like fill out the
other parts of my application at 11:00
p.m. on December first because I didn't
realize like if you wanted to be
considered for like any sort of
scholarship I had to like submit my
application I think it was by December
1st
I didn't realize till that night and it
was a mess so don't do that really make
sure you pay attention to deadlines
start your essay like over the summer I
least tried brainstorming over the
summer before when they like release the
topics of the common app just pay
attention to deadlines is all I can say
key so my fifth tip is to apply to safe
schools like probably schools and reach
schools because you want a diverse range
of schools so that when you get a bunch
of different acceptances you can weigh
up the options just apply to some that
you know you'll get into like your GPA
and your SAT scores are way higher and
then like one that you'll probably get
into like one that's in your range and
then a couple reach schools because like
why not they might accept you and then
you could go there and it would be
really cool so my first five tips were
sort of like getting into college I hope
they were helpful and then my last five
tips are more like when you're in
college so my sixth tip is once your
high school be really outgoing and
accepting of others like everyone has a
different background and customs
especially at BU it's so so diverse
people come from all over the world like
you just have to be so accepting it's so
cool you can learn so much about their
cultures the first week of school
keep your dorm room door open you will
meet so many people you'll become best
friends with the people on your floor
everyone will just make this cute little
community on your phone that's at least
how our floor is it's so nice and like
you'll meet your best friends that just
like wander into your room and you can
walk into other people's rooms and be
like hey what's up also make friends
with y'all right before coming to
college I was always scared of having it
all right people would be like oh my RA
is like so mean and like so strict
my RA is literally one of my best friend
she's like the sweetest person everyone
lives her down the hall and I love her
and she's like my mom they're just
really nice
usually my seventh tip is go to office
hours my fall semester of this year like
right now I'm in spring semester of my
freshman year probably should have said
that to begin with I remember everyone
was telling me to go to office hours and
I was like yeah yeah like whatever
everyone says that I didn't really have
time or make time to go and I was it
doesn't matter okay
it literally matters so much they help
you so much and they see that you're
trying and it's so worth it like the
semester I've been going to so many
office hours and it's so great here like
it for you especially like such a huge
university and my lecture halls with
like 300 people the professor seems so
scary to me because they're talking to
everyone would have to be really
professional but if you go like hang out
with them in office hours
throws big noises people so go to office
hours make a personal relationship with
your professors tip number eight make
sure you're enjoying what you're
studying first semester I was miserable
to be honest that was a bio major by
fall semester and I was so sure that I
wanted to major in my I want to go to
dental school I was like yes I bought
this I love taking bio classes like all
of high school and I think that was part
of the issue I was just honestly burned
out of file I was like I think I know
everything there is to know I just don't
care anymore I don't know if that's bad
to say but I just I couldn't make myself
enjoy doing work so I was like this has
to change I was just not happy and I was
like killing myself with like two
three-hour labs a week and it was just
not necessary so I'm really happy I
decided to switch on my classes I'm an
intro business cluster now and I love
them they're so interesting and I
definitely think business is the major
for me so hopefully I stay with business
make sure you like what you're learning
and if not change your major it's
usually pretty easy FPU it's pretty easy
and it's okay if you don't know what you
want to do most people don't know what
they want to do like most people come in
undeclared I almost recommend coming in
undeclared because you will probably
learn a lot more about what you want to
do your first semester in college even
though you think you know before you
really don't cuz I thought I knew and my
twin sister came in undeclared and I
feel like it's almost better that way
because then you can just declare one
instead of having to switch so nine is
spend your free time wisely just with
how your schedule pans out like you're
gonna have a lot more free blocks of
time but like designate those times for
studying really try to stay organized
and like play like okay this time every
day I'm going to study for economics
like whatever that that's most effective
or else you like fall into the routine
of coming back
like laying in your bed and taking naps
and watching Netflix I feel like a lot
of people struggle with coming to
college because they're losing all this
structure they had in high school with
their parents with their school like
with everything so if you really try to
like eat three healthy meals a day and
try to like work out every day and you
know stuff like that it'll feel a lot
better and like make a structure and
like a schedule for yourself so that you
can like hold yourself accountable or
else you might fall into like snapping
all the time and watching Netflix like I
said my tip number 10
I've always bad at this time management
give yourself enough time for everything
get up a little bit earlier so that you
feel more comfortable getting ready and
not like rushed and make sure you have
enough time to get to your classes in a
city can be hard to make sure you get to
your classes on time when they're like a
mile and half away you either have to
take the tea or the bus or walk or uber
you know what I'm saying if you're like
a small or like liberal arts college it
might be easier like your classes are
probably like across the street for your
own sake and sanity you don't want to be
the person that's always running late
it'll stress you out so just make sure
you have enough time for things give
yourself extra time to just kind of like
relax and I think if you plan out your
time better it'll make you a lot happier
so yeah like I said before sorry this
video is so long I just look I had a lot
of advice to give you we have any more
questions about college in general you

try to get back to you so yeah this is
just all the advice I could think of for
