video for you guys and I've been wanting
to film this video for a while now I
know it's pretty early in the season cuz
I know some people go back to college
like pretty late but I know some people
like some my friends go back really
early I know in other places the world
people will go back in like July so I
just wanted to get up this video nice
and early so I can give you like an idea
or a model of what to go off of as you
can tell by the title it's just gonna be
like a dorm room idea type of videos
I've everything staged just how I'm
pretty sure I'm going to set it up in
the fall because I don't move in till
really late I'm moving like beginning of
September because I know Boston
University is one of the later colleges
to move in I just have it all set up
here so that you guys can see how I like
to set in my dorm room and maybe it'll
give you an idea of how you can set up
yours and also everything I'm going to
be showing you and mentioning is from
this website called join Fi and dorm of
I just has like everything for your dorm
it's so great I think it's really
convenient to be able to get it all off
of like one place so there's like rugs
furniture comforters like everything so
yeah without further ado let's just get
on into it so this is the overview of
what I came up with for some dorm decor
ideas like I said everything is from
dorm Fi
so you can use the code Gretchen loves
Dorma fight to get 20 percent off of
their website and everything that I'm
going to be showing you from DOMA Phi
will be linked down below and then
there's like one or two other things
that aren't from Norma Phi that I just
throw in here because I thought they
would look good so the first thing is
just this fluffy white rug and this I
really love a lot my friend Taylor
actually at bu this semester had a
fluffy white Mongolian rug and I was
always jealous and wanted one so I'm so
happy I had this one to bring back with
me in the fall and I just think it
really pulls everything together I mean
the main focus is obviously the bed
so this duvet cover is from Durham PI as
well it's just the pink bandana-print
and I just think it looks so pretty and
then to go with it I got this ombre knit
throw blanket and guys I wish you could
feel how soft it is it's literally so
soft like I just know I'm gonna use it
all the time just to cuddle up so like
you know watch Netflix or edit videos
your some homework whatever with this
computer and I just threw this on here
too because usually at school I will
just have my computer resting on my bed
this is just my macbook that i use for
school and i have a marble case on it
which i think looks really nice as well
kind of goes with everything and I just
like marble too because it's very
neutral and it usually just goes with
pretty much anything that you put it
with and then we have pillows galore so
I love pillows and I always have a
million different throw pillows it's
usually hard for me to narrow down
exactly the ones that I want so this
pillow just says namaste in bed and I've
wanted this pillow for so long I'm
seriously obsessed with it
because I love doing yoga so namaste
means like a lot to me and I just really
like that saying so to have it kind of
like namaste and that I just think is so
cute and so funny and really clever too
so I just like how it's just simple and
black and white so again it goes with
everything and then this pillow i think
is so pretty too it's just this cream
like knit pillow it's really big and
fluffy and has some sequins on it which
I love I also have a silver sequin
pillow that I might use to I just didn't
show it in here because I already have
five six different pillows and then I
just have this gray Mongolian fluffy
pillow and it's just so fluffy and so
fuzzy I just love the way it looks and
then this is just the Sham that
obviously goes with this duvet cover
it's just the same pink bandana print
which i think is so bright and fun and
everything I showed you so far is
actually from Dharma Phi other than like
my computer I guess and then I'm gonna
go into a couple other things that
aren't from Dorma Phi which I just threw
in here because I thought it really
completed the look you know
so the first thing I'll mention is April
she's my bunny she's from build-a-bear
and I just think having a cute little
stuffed animal just looks really nice
and I don't know I'm like five at heart
so I just like the way stuffed animal
looks on my bed I don't care if it's not
like pitcher I just like the way it
looks and then this fluffy white
Mongolian fur pillow I actually had
before I got the gray one and that one
is just from Pottery Barn so it's
literally like the same as this one
though and this one's just gray and I
really like how both of those look
together and then this salt lamp I just
threw in because again I thought it
really just went nicely with everything
it's kind of like you know pinky orange
toned and this I actually got like an
antique type shop in Hilton Head South
Carolina so yeah I'm not even really
sure where I got it from but again I
just like the way it looks with
everything and this cup I'll usually
have on my Nightside table at bu because
I like to drink water a lot and it's
just really nice to have water when
you're sleeping so if you wake up and
you're really thirsty or when you're
going to bed or you wake up you have
some water so this Cup is just from
do you go it's like my favorite ever I
know I've talked about it in videos
before it's funny cuz like how can you
love a cup so much but I actually love
it
and in this lamp is just Lucy's and
usually they provide lamps at our dorms
and be so I don't think I'm actually
gonna bring it with me and also at
college in my dorm I like to have either
lights like this or Christmas lights so
I just think this looks really pretty
all along the railing right here and
yeah like I said most of this stuff
which is from dorm Fi I will have it
linked down below I just really like the
way this all came together and I know my
room in the fall will probably be set up
just like this and I hope this was
really helpful for you guys to give you
some dorm room ideas if you're not
really sure what you want to do for your
dorm room I hope this helped and when I
go to college I might even add like a
tapestry of some sort along the wall
because I think that would look really
good too yeah that is pretty much it
thank you guys so much for watching and
I will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
