sweet to our thumbs with this video and
my friend at Christiana actually made me
this jail B siren and I love it so much

me Boston University people that I care
about and I put it on my door and then
on the back of my door I just have my
Louie Vuitton bag which is dirty if you
can tell and actually just write a
comment on my vlog channel if you guys
don't know my vlog channel it's a
Gretchen Lucy go check it out I post
vlogs like all the time I'm gonna do
vlogmas cuz that's been really big
question but basically I read a comment
and someone said that if you use baby
wipes on it it should make the dirt come
off so I got to try that and then I just
have a bunch of jackets and sweatshirts
and then right here we just have this
little mirror I put on my door so I can
see my outfits take out for the day pics
this is just the outfit I'm wearing
today I just filmed for my outfit of the
week as well so yeah and also Everett's
mention if you guys have any questions
on my makeup right now actually just put
up an everyday makeup routine so
definitely go check that out and if
you're wondering my lips are in Coke
okay from Kylie Jenner because I feel
like people always ask and also Coco K
comes out kind of darker on me I noticed
it's like lighter on other people but I
like naturally pretty dark lips I would
say oh my watch do you guys like it
sorry this is getting really off-topic
but basically it's like this wooden
watch and I think it's so cool I got a
bunch of them and I'm going to show them
I think in like a watch collection too
because I just feel like that would be a
cool video to show and I really like
watches and I have a bunch of my
different brands can you leave a comment
down below if you want to see the
kawatche collection because I just feel
like that would be really fun and like
helpful anyways back to the room tour
it's like my closet with me rats from
Target and I'm going to try to see where
everything's from in case you guys are
interested
you're just my backpack because I'm
going to go to class today is Monday and
I only have one class on Monday from
11:00 to 12:30 so yeah Monday's are the
best and here's my closet oh my gosh
also you'll notice I didn't pick up
anything for the sake of this video it's
just gonna be raw and natural and like
how it normally is so if here I just
have all my sweat shirts and sweat pants
in my head they're like folded in nice
but like actually it's not really how it
is and then here I just have some of my
like most worn shoes just kind of like
thrown in there I don't even know what
that is a other sweatshirt and then just
some clothes that I hang up and then
these drawers I guess I'll show you I
just have like undies and socks and PJs
and like random food and granola bars
almond butter these are my running shoes
if I actually ask any questions about
them I think I'm gonna do a workout
routine soon once I get in tomorrow
routine but these are saucony like
trainers I'm not sure exactly what kind
but I think you can tell by just looking
at them cuz having any questions on them
so I just throw those right there
usually cuz I wear them like every day
so they're just easy to grab and then on
the back of my closet door I just have
some scarves alright ready for an
overview of my room I didn't even like
show it to you yet here is a little
overview so obviously it's like light
out right now but I put on my Christmas
lights for the sake of the video usually
I don't have them on during the day
right here I just have my microwave in
my fridge not too beautiful it's kind of
a mess I just have some like random food
up here these are so good guys and
they're vegan case you're wondering
OOP I just have some stew taters here
because that's like all I eat and I just
make them in the microwave and then some
tea this I went like a beYOU yoga thing
the other day and it was so fun and they
gave me that water bottle so that's
really nice this is so good guys my dad
got it for loosing me for college when
we like eat food here and it's Jane's
crazy mix of salt would highly recommend
it's really good and then this is just a
water bottle I use in pro tip guys so if
you have a Nalgene you can put like a
Camelback top on it and it fits is you
know Camelback tops are better to drink
out of cuz you just like suck on it but
then I took a bigger bottle so life hack
it's actually really nice that I have
like a single this year cuz I have my
own microwave and fridge so I can just
fill it up with a bunch of stuff I don't
even know what's in here oh that I
really like I like put it on rice
there's this like pear juice I'm
obsessed with more tea sriracha Oh looks
like I like spilled I'm gross dates
almond milk I'm water a huge bag of rice
it's usually that because it's like I'll
eat hummus I think that's some gogo
squeeZ like applesauce in here
typical I just have a bunch of frozen
bananas real expose evils which I'm
waiting for my blender to come still but
I use like Lucy's in the meantime and
then I just have some ice cube trays and
you guessed it rice then I just like
empty packages right here from when I
ship stuff to you guys on Poshmark and
I'm going to be posting soon I promise I
still have so many clothes on there but
I'm like really busy with classes right
now I just have some tape
I actually questions on these on - these
are like white converse that I wear all
the time but they're like all white
people always ask what kind they are and
I got them at like a converse outlet and
they're in kids cuz I had like a woman's
eight so as long as I can get shoes in
kid size six and they fit perfect if I
can find them I'll try to link them down
below I think I found a link for like
Foot Locker so yeah then I just have
some Trader Joe's cereal some extra
peanut butter lol I'm obsessed and then
the rest of the room okay so this is
like a dresser that view just gives you
and you know like the furniture in here
like the bed and like fat just like
comes with the single and this carpet is
literally the reason I've been waiting
to film this room tour for so long
because I've just been waiting for it to
come in so before this one I'd like a
small really dinky furry one then this
one I literally am obsessed with it's so
fluffy nice we're just gonna talk real
quick so my friend Noelle she's in a
single in the suite like two doors down
and she actually has this carpet in grey
and I was like obsessed with it and so
fluffy and I was like I love it where
did you get it and she's like oh I got
it from Costco and I've like heard of
Costco but from where I'm from we don't
have Costco so I was like oh my gosh
like I need it didn't have it in white
and she was like yeah they do so luckily
I have Noelle what a gem and I was able
to buy this carpet like with her Costco
membership and it came and I'm obsessed
with it I just love it and again if I
can find a link to a link down below I
think it was like pretty expensive but
I'm like okay literally it's worth it I
love it it's so fluffy and I will be
using it all this year and next year in
year after that so I feel like this is
like really just organized but I'll just
show you what's right here so this is
just my dresser
I'm scared about what we're gonna see
yeah we just got some bras sports bras
bunch of workout clothes my drawers were
like sparse right now because like all
my clothes are dirty but I hate doing
laundry so I never do it there was a
good winner has some more workout
clothes t-shirts tank tops blah blah
blah in here I just have shorts which I
literally brought because I was like
Gretchen it's gonna be warm in the
beanie the year and it was for like a
week and I didn't wear like any shorts
but whatever and these are like my
favorite skirts ever from Urban
Outfitters I just have some skirts so
joggers and here I just have some jeans
and some ligands those again are like
the piles are so short because usually
they're like falling out of the drawers
but I like so many dirty leggings right
now from like yoga and running in
whatever and then down here is literally
just a mess it's like plastic silverware
pussy bowls this foam apologize I
painted this pole over the summer if you
guys remember that vlog I love you just
have another what about a lint roller so
I'm in water I don't even know and brown
rice and that's the rest of I always
making my race cooker alright here I
didn't even show you I just have a
little trash can that's been targeted
and then this tripod that I've had
literally since my day one of YouTube
has never failed me love you tripod one
there's a phone charger I think Lucy

this white little jewelry box and I
believe I got this from home goods and I
just have like jewelry and such and I am
I painted my nails before this video and
look I just took my nail hang it right
here I just have all these watch boxes

said it wrong I think it's youred
but I just have a bunch of this boxes

is from society 6 which I will get into
right here I just have this little
bracelet holder with some bracelets that
I wear a lot and right here I just have
my perfume tray with my favorite
perfumes I'd leave like a lot at home
this year because I was like Gretchen
you're not gonna make your room a mess
like it was freshman year cuz I like way
too much crap everywhere what is this oh
this is just the yoga studio I go to so
it's like my little thingy yeah I will
just address all the Christmas lights so
I wanted them to go all the way around
my room and I'm actually really bitter
cuz the way it worked out there's no
Christmas lights right there but there
was like nothing I could do because I
could get another strand for right there
but that like I don't know it'd look
really dumb so whatever it goes almost
around my whole room and they're just
white Christmas lights I got them all
from Amazon yeah I just typed in like
white Christmas lights and got I think
this is 2 or 3 strands
ok we're gonna go back over here cuz I
didn't show this you might recognize
this photo from my freshman dorm room
tour I think it's really cute and I just
kind of went with like the theme in my
room I tried to go with really like
neutral like black and white this I got
from Target I'm fairly certain and this
I just love putting right here love you
mommy and daddy miss you oh this is just
a little note
my dad sent us with like a package we
got last year says smoochies love you
girls daddy and mommy
but it's parents weekend this weekend so
I get to see my mommy and I'm so excited
anyway I'm still a kid okay moving on I
got this white garment rack from Amazon
and it has been such a savior because I
cannot fit all my clothes in that tiny
little closet this closet is literally
smaller than my freshman year closet
which was always overflowing so yeah
this has been like a life saver
and it was like super cheap and it's
kind of like wobbly I was reading much
reviews and it's like really wobbly but
if you just have like some clothes on
there and not like a million winter
jackets you should be fine and I tried
to do like a cool little like ombre like
scheme but it's kind of like not in
order right now and a little messy but
yeah down here would we have a little
mess these are some things I want to
show in like a haul video those are some
like receipts and random stuff and also
by the way I want to mention the way my
single came like set up it was not set
up like this at all like I completely
rearranged it but this is just the way
that works like best for me so if you're
in a single in Stevie too it doesn't
come looking like this I just like
arranged it like this and here's my
little desk and I put it right in front
of the window me my friend Taylor we're
saying how annoying it is that the
windows were like so dirty because we
have such a pretty view right like the
Charles and looks to be one and
everything I can like stalk my friends
and they're walking back from Buick it's
great our view so pretty but I don't
know if you can tell the window is like
quite dirty and it's on the outside like
it's not on the inside of the outside so
for you if you're watching this clean
the outside of these windows and it's
riders have some makeup and it's why
just have a bunch of nail polish
literally every time I speak just uses
my nail polish I'm like the nail salon
it's great and I don't even know what's
in here no it's probably a mess oh yeah
just like random books notebook and this
right here is literally a mess I can't
even open it so we're just not gonna
look in there I just have two little
stuffed animals are here they're both
from head of the Charles and head of the
Charles is it's weekend I'm so excited
to watch I can't wait cuz you guys know
I rode all the last year on the
lightweight team but I'm not running
anymore so it'll be really fun to just
like be a spectator because I've always
rode in it right here I just have this
acrylic drawer that I think I got from
the Container Store I just have some
makeup in there that I wear like every
day and last year I was crazy about
packing and I like taped up all my
things because I was scared that they're
gonna like fall apart when we drove here
and look what happened there's like tape
marks literally stuck on there and then
I'm this cute little health and up here
because you guys know I freaking love
elephants
thanks Alison I love it and then I just
have it two little cups with all my
make up brushes right here I just have
all my Kylie lip kits because yeah I
have a problem and like I said I'm on
coke okay right now I think it's this
one yeah now here I just have this
little white like organizer thing if you
can see I just have some random like
notebooks and papers and stuff right
here I just have my school computer and
this is just like a MacBook Air and I
use from my classes after member to
throw this my bags I'm about to go to
stats lecture I just have a MacBook Air
for like my classes and I know I've had
questions about this before people are
like how do you have two computers but
this is for classes and then this one
over here is where I use to edit videos
cuz that's a MacBook Pro but I like to
have them separate because this one's a
lot lighter and then my videos like slow
to my computer so I didn't want to have
to work on like a slow computer for my
school work you know but anyways okay I
just have my Bose speaker which I love
and I always listen to you when I'm like
getting ready and yeah it's the best
thanks daddy you got it for me for
Christmas and then right here I just
have some emergency because everyone's
getting freaking sick and guys emergency
is life I remember my friend Hannah
showed it to me right and Chris use all
the time and Mandy and yet you just
gotta get emergency it literally will
keep you healthy when everyone around
you is getting really sick so take
emergency but here I just have this
mirror that I use when I get ready I
have some set of a lotion that I always
use for do my makeup right here at my
hydro flask Lucy actually got a really
huge one and convinced me and literally
guys this is like a game-changer it
keeps your water cold for ever like four
days I'm not kidding like I put cold
water in here last night and it's still
freezing cold like it's amazing how much
got a bigger one but anyway you might
recognize this lamp is actually from my
room at home I took it from my room at
home this is yours from Pottery Barn and
it's just this white roughly lamp but I
just really think it's cute I thought it
would go with my room oh I didn't even
show you these these are also from
society6 and I think they're so cute I
just thought it would go with like the
theme of my room this is definitely by
far my favorite photo I have in here
because it says wake up and makeup and I
just think it's so cute
and I've this clock that has some Chanel
perfume on it and I just have this
pineapple guys what do you think I need
your input so right here is like pretty
open and bare and I also realized you
might notice that all these photos are
just like you know what cool pictures
but I have no pictures of like me and my
friends like I swear I have friends so I
wanted to put like a bunch of pictures
of me and my friends are here and if you
remember my room trio from last year I
have like a whole wall with lights and
just pictures of me and my friends so I
slowed it went all those pictures like
printed out and I was thinking I might
put them there and like frame so what do
you think do
would be like too much oh do you think I
should like put more pictures of me my
friends right they're like let me know
what you think all right then down here
I just had this little bucket that I had
in my room last year and I just
literally have random stuff I have like
hair straightener chargers I have this
little fan right here and okay who is
like me I don't like having a err blonde
at me and I like I don't like being cold
but I just like the sound of a fan so I
literally leave it right there and just
turn it on because I like the sound and
then I just have random bags like thrown
right there it's like really messy and I
just have a bag of clothes that I'm
selling on Poshmark like I said I will
post them soon then this is like really
innovative shout out Scott and like
Taylor because Taylor stepdad Scott he
actually organized Taylor's room like
this so I completely copied her because
it like worked out really well and this
actually goes on top of the desk with
like a light on top and the light is
back there and then this I just made
into like a shoe rack how innovative so
these are just some heels booties more
boots these boots I usually have like
right there but obviously they're on my
feet today I just have a yoga mat and I
keep it right there because I have to
like grab it every day I want to go to
yoga we are nearing the end I feel like
I've been blabbing on forever but my bed
is like super comfy and something I take
a lot of pride in I'm just kidding but I
actually love it and I'm gonna show you
guys okay if you're in college you know
or if you're gonna go to college you
have to know that you have to get like a
really good mattress topper by this
really thick like memory foam mattress
topper which is so good and I'm gonna
link it down below too because I did so
much research on it it was on Amazon and
I think it was only like 100 or
something and honestly it's so worth it
cuz you're gonna sleep way better and
literally what happened is I been at
school with so comfy so that last year
freshman year and I went home the first
time I couldn't sleep in my like even my
full-size bed at home because it wasn't
comfy enough so I ended up getting this
mattress topper for my full-size bed at
home too because it's so comfortable
anyway rant is over so I just wanted a
very like neutral bed I just have this
really fluffy do guy from Amazon as well
that's like so warm because I hate being
cold and obviously can get really cold
in Boston so my duvet cover is like
really warm and really thick and I'll
have it linked down below as well my
Amazon and then this white duvet cover
is just from Target I believe because I
knew I just wanted like a plain white
one and then this black and white fuzzy
blanket that's just like a throw blanket
is from society6
it's actually like an elephant print and
I love it so much because I love
elephants you know there's my purple
MacPro that I just added my videos on
because I literally will always just
look at it in bed and then all my
cute little pillows so this one is from
Norma Phi I like love this pillow it's
so me like I'm really lazy but I love
yoga so like yes the miss black initial
pillow just with a G is actually from
Walmart and I love it I think it's so
cute then this white fluffy pillow is
from a Pottery Barn it's so fluffy and
nice to just lay on I love it
here's my gray pillow pet charlie love
Charlie I always hang out with him and
then April because I love April guys her
stomach smells like cotton candy it's
really great just so you know and my
white lace headboard is from you board I
actually showed it in a dorm hall at the
end of the summer with like a bunch of
this stuff yeah it's just from you board
if I can find a link to it I only get
down below as well so you can see what
it is because when everyone comes in
here they're like oh my gosh you're the
headboard and I'm like yes I do it's a
lifesaver
knocking lie and then right here I just
have my youtube plaque because I just
love it I think it's so cute so I just
hung it over my bed and then right here
you're probably wondering where the heck
is this tapestry from so this is from
society6 and be forewarned guys I didn't
know what I was doing and I just thought
that large was like the size to get and
it is like huge is so big but end up
working out and I really like the way it
looks like draped over my ceiling but
there was like no other way I could do
it because it was way too big to just
like hang from my wall like starting
like at the top of the wall because then
all you would see is like white so I
actually really like the way it looks
just people are warned that if you get a
large it is like very very large like I
didn't even look at the measurements
because I'm dumb and then like now I got
stuff from society6 for my common room
and like the hallway like tapestries and
stuff and I've only got mediums because
I realized like large is very very big
so I think that is it guys wow this is
so fun I finally filmed a little room
tour it's really nice having a single
like have your own space but to like be
in a suite with a bunch of other girls
because I hate being alone I love being
with other people so it's great that I
can always just go out in the common
room and just like hang out with my
buddies so I think that is it definitely
thumbs up this video if you guys enjoyed
and leave me a comment down below and
thumbs up the video if you want to see a
sweet tour because I'll definitely do
that if you guys want like I said
there's eight of us in here and it's
really fun there's four singles and two
doubles so yeah thank you guys so so
much for watching I'll see my next video
