be at my college dorm room tour for 2017
if you guys didn't know I'm a junior at
Boston University I am in West Campus I
mean it's 2v2 in the apartment style
room with four of us living here and
then we also have the kitchen and common
area it's a quick overview when you walk
and it just looks like this and here is
my door and then on this side I just
have like a towel a sweatshirt I left
things like how they normally are so
some things are only totally clean but I
just want to be really real with how it
actually is in college before I forget
to mention everything I can find in this
video online I will have link down below
so you guys can it get the same things
as me we can't win so if you guys can't
tell my bed is actually a full-size bed
and these apartment dorms always come
with twin sized beds but now I'm a
junior I've had a twin bed crammed in a
little dorm room for two years now and I
always like you know what I'm not having
it I want to live on campus wanted means
to be with my friends but I just can't
be in a twin bed anymore so I know this
is like extra AF but when my roommates
leave last year she had a different
person's twin bed and her twin bed like
pushed together so it makes a king so
then this year I was like hey like are
you planning on doing that again like
you can take my twin bed that way I can
get a full-size bed in my room I'm just
gonna buy one and she was like yeah like
that's awesome so it worked out so well
and any of the dorms at BU I know it's
like a policy because I get so many
questions of how I have a full-size bed
here and you can't like call housing and
be like hey can you get rid of my bed
for me because they like won't take it
away it's like one of their policies so
there's a will there's a way
that's what I've learned and I was just
done having a twin size bed and having
this full really comfy bed is so worth
it okay so my full-size bed that I got
is a Lisa mattress you guys remember my
moving vlog I talked all about Lisa
basically they have at the comfiest
mattresses ever and now I can
confidently tell you that examples
include last week I had more time than
normal to sleep and for Monday through
Thursday I slept 13 hours every night
like this bed is so comfy that if you
have the time to sleep that much like
you just well Isaac NAT he slept over
the other day and she never like slept
in my bed and she was like what the heck
this bed is literally the comfiest bed
ever like I'm coming over to sleeping
you're about all the time down and I
fell asleep right now Lisa
are so comfy I'd highly recommend just
like so convenient that they have the
mattresses delivered to you and
everything
now I've leased a link down below so you
guys can check it out if you are
interested I know there's like a sweet
discount in the description box as well
to definitely go check that out and I'm
actually waiting for some Lisa pillows
they're like on the way and I'm so
excited because if they're even half as
comfortable as it's bad they're gonna be
like the best pillows ever bought this
on Amazon I really want to do that but I
have a link down below and then this
alpha B blanket is from society6 I just
love having it here and I think it just
makes my bed look really cute and then
there's April you guys know her she's
from build-a-bear it shows her Pinkle
onesie on and she smells like cotton
candy
then there's Charlie my elephant pillow
pet and then I just have these two
white really big fluffy pillows from
dorm F I actually this few guys it never
gets old best part of my room look at my
view it's literally insane okay one
thing I want to mention is that I don't
know if you can tell how small my room
is me and my three roommates mine's very
obviously the smallest but now I've
learned to love how cozy it is and just
how amazing the view is it's so worth it
it's over here we have the Charles River
obviously in the Harvard stadiums right
there so that's pretty cool the Harvard
quad is like right over there Cambridge
there's a Trader Joe's down there
the BU boathouse is right down that way
you really can just see like so far you
can see the highway that's cool you can
see trains going by this view is just so
cool and my favorite part is how it
wraps around so you can see rich
sleeping Claflin the freshman sophomore
dorms here and then Abbey's will bring
10 19 hi hi Louise I love you guys and
this is just Nickerson tennis court so
yeah my view is like unreal and Stevie
too isn't like the cheapest place to
live on campus it's pretty expensive but
in my opinion it's pretty worth a
because I want to stay exactly where I
am but I'm like very high up and Stevie
too on one of the top floors so my view
is just like unreal then the gallery
wall and I would like to apologize in
advance I know these are not straight by
any means I did not use a level I didn't
measure it out at all I literally just
went at it one night hang him up all by
myself and you know what I think it
turned out pretty well every single one
of these prints is from society's sake
just kind of mixed them all together and
not that I just turned out so cute I
really like them this desk just comes
with the apartment in this chair as well
here's my computer I just have look at
alfea sticker and a dos sticker you guys
know dope shopping is like my favorite
shopping app I played my internship with
them this summer and then I actually
just got this sign and like a PR package
the other day from Venus thank you I
love it so much and it just says
touching the hearts Ave in lieu for a B
and Luisa because they're just my best
friends and I love them and I want to
change it too tis the season but I just
haven't got around to it so that's what
it's all says I just have a mirror here
that can like do my makeup in much like
my PJ outfit guys here's my Canon 70d
that I will issue some videos with and
take pictures with and I actually just
got a mic cuz if you guys have noticed
some of my main channel videos like no I
don't have a long shell anymore so
everything's being channel but a lot of
my haul videos and stuff that's on auto
focus it can be really like loud so I
just ordered a mic it's on its way so no
more crickety loud haul videos anyway I
digress I mean this is actually like a
corkboard thing and I just have this
note from my dad it says great seeing
you XO daddy so cute because like I was
in Manhattan all summer if you guys know
and then I was home for like a week or
two at the end of the summer before I
came back to bu and he just hides a
little notes in this stuff that I
brought to PU and thought it was so cute
he put one in the top of my oatmeal
container too nice to leave it there cuz
when I do a meal like all the time I
always see it there and it's just like
cute little reminder up here we just
have all sorts of stuff and this is what
I'm talking about guys I'm really not
that organized these candles I'll just
see clearly don't even really use them
that much I don't even think you're
allowed to I just have this lotion here
that I will use sometimes it's from Bath
and Body Works I have a hockey puck from
when me and Abby went on the ice at
halftime it was like the first time ever
go watch that blog because it's really
funny I'm a pair of sunglasses that I
can like grab and go from going
somewhere this cos Alabama I actually
think is my friend Sam Sam if you're
looking for us the bomb here it is and
then my jewelry and like watches and
stuff are just kind of like all over the
place and that's how it always is
whoever's hoop earring this is also I
think nap is my peers Mady if you're
looking for hoop earring there's one
here and only one some chapstick over
here we have my Mario Badescu rose water
spray I really enjoy that this is like
your life if you're a u2
where you know what I'm talking about
just the stupid new MacBooks only have
like USBC ports on them aside and
they're not compatible with like
literally anything and then all cameras
have SD cards so then you have to get a
bunch of these things and all sorts of
converters so I just always have it
there because I used it like every day
when I am important footage of my
computer I vitamin C because I'm always
sick I'm probably getting sick right now
it's so annoying so I take this all the
time
there's my youtube flat how cute it's
like my hundred thousand TLV little
plaque that is my desk
this is a tapestry from society6 pretty
much everything that's like decorative
in this room is for society6 because i
just love them this tapestry I just
thought was so cute I know it's in a
size large in case you're wondering and
I'll have that linked down below exactly
the same prints you can find it and I
also Christmas liked going up around
like my whole room Heather just white
also have a link down below I just got
them on Amazon I know so they're really
cute normally I don't have them on
during the day or anything but I turn
them on for the purpose of this video
okay moving this way I've a bunch of
these like bins everywhere cuz I am NOT
organized and they kind of help me throw
all my stuff into a pile and make it
look more organized let's see this is
just like clothes and skincare and stuff
so that's that and then my dresser I'm
really not opening any of these drawers
because they're all really messy but
this is just a bunch of clothes like yep
oh geez what have you done oh wait I
should tell you I'm a little bit place
okay this rug has seen better days
clearly I know it's from rugs USA it's
like really dirty right there and then
over here where people don't stand
that's like clean but I had it in
Manhattan a summer for like a month or
two so it got really dirty but I think
there's always people and clothes and
shoes and stuff all over the place so
that's why it's three that's just a
cardi a back with the rings that I got
in the fall I just got a gold one and a
silver one they're like the wedding
bands of skinnier ones because I really
like the way they look stacked oh this
is really funny my big net and my grand
big ariana I love you guys so much
they got me flowers not too long ago but
then they died and then I throw them out
and I got this rose for when I gotta buy
to crush party put in there now I'm
noticing it looks pretty dead but I
didn't have a vase so I stole Taylor's
Hydra flask so it's really funny that a
Hydra flask is my base but anyway I just
another little candle there
oh this bracelet so cute guys look these
are the coordinates of where Abby and me
met I love you so much have and I got
her this bracelet for her birthday and I
got a matching one but I literally did
not take mine off for like months so
look at how like old it looks it's
getting very bored out so I just wear it
sometimes now instead of like every day
because like showering with it and
sweating with it like all the time would
just get it pretty nice dude I got it
from Brooke in New York by the way but
then I just have some perfume I have a
scrunchie I have a bunch of hair ties I
mean start composite for alfie that we
just got recently there's me and I'm
right next to a bee which is so cute
because we actually met during the
crewman last spring fun fact that's how
we became besties so yeah that's why our
names are like near each other cuz we're
in the same guy group down here just a
bit with more stuff these are like new
clothes I want to show a new video this
is a bunch of primary from Smashbox
thanks Smashbox I'm so excited try it
out then this lamp I know it's from
pbteen I actually broke it see the
insides all like smash but it still
works it's still a highly functioning
lab then I have this little soap &amp;amp; Glory
hydrating like lotion spray thing going
back over here this is one of my closets
okay
let me explain so you guys know my best
friend Taylor she loves it being in her
room is right there and is literally
twice the size of this room like when I
moved in I'm not kidding I cried and I
know that sounds insane like I'm so
lucky I'm so blessed I get to live here
like it is actually really hard to get
in this to v2 by itself and I was just
really lucky because you guys know I
wrote on the lightweight rowing team my
freshman year here and then sophomore
year just made it really easy to get
pulled in because I was a rower I lived
it allowed the rowers my sophomore year
and a sweet and soo v2 which has eight
people which is really fun but just a
lot when you have eight people and you
don't have a kitchen or anything you so
love a good dining plan so that in my
junior year I got pulled into apartments
to be to which those are so hard to get
into but again I just got really lucky
because I still live with all Rovers
right now so I just not really lucky
that I got like into the stew v2 system
of like pulling in early on because of
all right so that's why I got in here
and then once I got here I was like my
room is tiny I'm so sad and then Megan
Lee and Taylor were like wow your room
is literally the smallest thing ever
like I don't even know if you guys can
tell from me showing you around but like
it is very very small like this whole
size but it takes up
the homeroom but again not complaining
so lucky so happy that I live here I
almost didn't get in and yeah I just I'm
really happy to live here and it's like
really cozy so I've learned to love it
my view is amazing but that being said
don't the smallest room so we kind of
made a deal that you guys know I have
like an insane amount of clothes and I
brought my clothing rack actually to go
in here but it doesn't fit anywhere so
we have three hall closets and I was
actually allowed by my roommates I got
permission in it to take over two of
them and then I have my closet here so I
have it three closets I know having
three closets is like wild but the
pretty small closets and then that way I
can like fit all my stuff here because
my arm is so small so I just want to say
that really quick this is my main calls
it and then I'll show you my like
sweater jacket cause it and then my
dress closet okay so on the back of this
door I just have like my most worn
leather jacket this is just like my all
team's jacket I get a lot of questions
about this too I feel like I'm people
asking rights from it's just from all
teens it's kind of the more like
distressed leather one this is the Gucci
belt that I got recently I'm so obsessed
with it it's just like the classic
double G gold one this is a
representation of my life of you know
but um yeah these are like pretty much
most my sweatshirt and sweatpants and
it's just never organized up there and
like I try folding them in piles and
then it just gets like that anyway so
now I just have accepted the fact that
it's always gonna look like that then
this is my main closet that has there's
like crop tops and like t-shirts and
long sleeve tops this is just like my
top closet right here these are mixed
with crop tops crop tank tops body suits
tube tops Pindos like that's all right
there and then in here this thing is
from the Container Store by the way it's
like really helpful I have more like
workout tank tops in there because I
just have so many of those like one of
those drawers it's t-shirts and workout
tank tops that's also market tank tops I
do not work out enough for how many
workout clothes I have I mean I used to
for riding but just not anymore
anyway those are all socks in there
those are all undies and then my soul
cycle shoes are in there got slippers
right there I don't know why there's a
bra there but I have more slippers
they're dirty clothes and like a little
laundry back there my school backpack is
there and it's still the one that I have
from rowing so that's why it says 130
rowing I figure out with your questions
about that too because in a backpack
you're like what is that and that's just
because I was on the wrong team
my running sneakers are right there I
like a fan back there and there's like a
random FedEx box there I guess I'll just
show you guys really quick my two other
closets and then we'll be concluding my
room to it so this is the closet I have
with like all sweaters and jackets and
stuff and this is just like right by the
front door which is really nice
so I can just grab that stuff to go what
I'm leaving on the desert full-length
mirror if you guys didn't notice I don't
have like a full-length mirror in my
room but this is just like the flooring
here that we all share - AI we I can't
wait to do an apartment tour and show
like everyone's rooms because your room
is like obviously so cute but one day
we'll show everything cuz it was really
clean yesterday
it'll be cleaning it soon this is my
dress closet which just has all sorts of
crazy dresses there's some like party
lines long ones like simple t-shirt ones
you guys know like I have a bunch of
formals and like events and stuff for
the game shorty so that's why it's
really helpful to have so many dresses
and then whenever anyone needs one like
I need my friends they just come
tomorrow one so that's cool and then
also in the bottom of a bunch of closets
I have these big bins with all my shoes
so yeah I guess that is it for my room
tour I hope I mentioned everything that
you can see and remember I love
everything down below that I can find
case were interested oh wait that's one
thing I can see right now that I do
mention my hundred flasks good stuff
keeps your water gold like forever oh
yeah thank you guys so much for watching
and I'll see you next video
