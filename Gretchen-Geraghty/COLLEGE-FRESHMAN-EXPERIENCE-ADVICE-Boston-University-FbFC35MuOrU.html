year experience and advice video and
I've been meaning to film this video for
a while now because Boston University
got out this year on May 7th May 8th I
think I left hey hey I believe so I got
out of school like a while ago but I've
been collecting my thoughts for a while
in this video is actually a collab with
few other youtubers one is Brooke michio
and her video will be linked down below
is bubbles her Instagram she go follow
her on Instagram and go subscribe to her
and the other youtuber is blowing the
boutique and you should go subscribe to
her youtube and also follow her
Instagram which will be linked down
below sorry I got kind of sudden Burnett
work today wow I got a lot of Sun and
also in case you're wondering my shirt
is from Urban Outfitters before we begin
because I put a picture with this shirt
on Instagram and there's a lot of
questions so I just want to say that I
wrote 12 different tips on my phone so
that's why I'm gonna be reading off of
here a lot and also I go to Boston
University I just finished my freshman
year in case you guys didn't know if
you're new to my channel and I'm talking
about view a lot of my channel before
but in case you didn't know so let's
just get into it the first thing I wrote
is make sure you're enjoying your
classes because if you're not enjoying
your classes maybe you should think
about changing your major I wanted to be
you as a biology major and I was
miserable like I just did not enjoy my
biology and chemistry classes it was way
too much work and it was just overload
for first semester freshman year I would
not recommend taking biology and
chemistry together it's at all possible
because it was just terrible so I was
like okay Gretchen like I gotta change
my major and I transferred into the
questrom business school at Boston
University and I'm so much more happy
like I took Business and Finance classes
in the spring it was just way better so
yeah really make sure you're enjoying
the classes you're taking because
College is a lot harder it's a big step
up from high school but if you're
enjoying the classes you're taking it's
worth it and it seems more fun since
you're like interested so make sure that
you are interested in if you're not
change it up the second thing I wrote is
embrace change and this I really
struggle with I'm just a type of person
that hates change I just can't deal with
it like when even the littlest things
change I just get really stressed out
and agitated and I just don't like
change and Burke on YouTube actually
helped me accept change a lot I watched
a video of her as I don't even remember
exactly which one it was but it was
about college and she said you know you
just have to accept the fact that like
there is a lot of change happening all
at once like you're in a new place with
new people taking new classes
it's just a completely different
environment so it was like hard for me
but I guess I don't even really have
advice on how to accept and embrace
change because I'm not really good at it
but if you can it makes it a lot easier
the third thing I wrote is say yes to
everything and I mean maybe not
everything like it's something that
you're not comfortable with by all means
don't or if bad don't do that
but I just mean like get out and do
stuff like I kind of regret this a
little bit I feel like there was times
where I was like oh no like you go to
the museum without me you're like oh go
to dinner without me I'm really tired
I'm just gonna stay in whatever but like
literally just say yes to everything
like college is only four years of your
life like you want to have fun you want
to try new things it's a good time to
just get out there and explore so my
third tip is just say yes to everything
the fourth thing I wrote is be welcoming
and open and a good listener because
there is gonna be people from so many
different backgrounds at the college you
go to literally everywhere like I've met
so many people from all around the world
at BU and it's so amazing being able to
hear about their culture and just like
people are gonna be a lot different than
you so just be really accepting about it
and you're gonna find your best friends
in places that you wouldn't even expect
and like you just have to be really
welcoming and really open to everything
that you're gonna confront in college if
it's hip is at the same time though only
feel with people that make you a better
person because you will run into people
that are toxic and seemingly their goal
in life is to just ruin your life and
hate you and personally attack you but
for people like that I would just say if
you really have to deal with them like
if it's someone that you can't avoid
like maybe a professor or something find
a healthy way to cope with it and in the
long run try to remove yourself
ultimately from the situation because
you are gonna run into difficulty
poland' that's just a part of growing up
my sixth tip is only do what you're
comfortable with but remember to have
fun so kind of going back into like say
yes to everything like really only do it
you're comfortable with if someone's
like pressuring you no don't do that but
just remember to have fun like don't
have too much fun because you're
obviously there to focus on academics
but it's still important to have fun and
you don't want to just be stressed out
from school all the time my seventh tip
is embrace the people on your floor
because they will become your bestest
friends you're gonna see them all the
time since you're on your floor leave
your dorm room open the first week
especially you're gonna make all your
new friends and it's like your own
little family away from home your dorm
room floor at least that's how mine
I know that's how a lot of people's
freshman year dorm floors are like so
just embrace them it may seem a coyote
she's in California on the other side of
the country
my eighth tip is you only get out what
you put in so if you're only present ten
percent of the time and putting in ten
percent of effort you can't expect to
get amazing grades or even like in
relationships if you're not putting in
all your effort you can't expect more
than what you're putting in you know
what I'm saying
and your mama's neck college with you
like no one is there to hold you
accountable so you have to have your own
motivation to get up and do what needs
to be done and succeed on your own
without someone else pushing you which
is hard in college because you have so
much structure in high school it's like
this is the hours that you have class
every day and your parents telling you
to do in college you don't have that so
a lot of motivation has to come from
within and my ninth tip is that don't
think that everyone has it all figured
out because I feel like that like I was
like wow like everyone around me knows
what's going on like they're having the
time of their lives like I just feel so
stressed out like is this supposed to be
the funnest time of my life because I
just feel really worried about academics
am I even taking the right classes am I
even going down the right career path I
just realized that like everyone's
having the same feelings as you no one
knows what they're doing with their life
I circled a lot physically mentally
socially emotionally just first semester
it's a huge change like I said before so
everywhere I look every other freshman
looked like they had it together and
they were having the best time of their
lives and I kept thinking like what
about B so I ran into one of my high
school friends Kathleen the other day I
love you Kathleen and it was so nice
seeing you that's another thing like
friends from home are gold like you will
just realize that so much more when you
are away from them like you're gonna be
so excited to see them and it's almost
even better that way because you have so
much to talk about so she like reassured
me like listen like every freshman is
kind of stressed out and freaking out I
just realized that everyone's struggling
with the same stuff as you no one knows
if they're making the right choices or
taking the right classes and you just
kind of have to let go with your gut and
try your best I guess and everything
that you're doing another thing with
this tip is I don't think I was is ready
for college as I thought even if you're
like I'm ready to move out like that's
what I said
you're not like go get your mom an extra
hug right now you won't regret it I
promise because you're gonna miss those
hugs when you're in college my tenth tip
is that
your roommate your RA you're not as bad
as it seems I feel like I was so scared
going into college just cuz I've heard
like horror stories about terrible
roommates or terrible Ras and that's
really not how it is my RA Steph I love
you Steph she is such a great friend and
she was one of the sweetest most caring
people after you like always checking in
like how are you doing and I'm like well
if it's so nice to like be with someone
that cares and my roommate as well just
great great people the bathrooms aren't
as bad as they seem like people plead
them ok it's not gonna be awful and
believe it or not frat boys in our
states at least the ones that I
encountered or intelligence and nice and
not horrible human beings like movies
make them seem tip number 11 is that
your metabolism it does change how
convenient freshman year you really have
to try to keep off the freshman 15 at
least I feel like I did I know everyone
has different experiences but like make
a schedule work out eat three healthy
meals a day I mean whatever works for
you like if you need to eat more than
that or less than that you know what I'm
saying whatever like my sister eats like
more constantly like smaller meals and I
know that works for a lot of people but
I like to sit down and eat like a full
meal so I like eating three meals a day
but whatever works for you so yeah you
really have to try and just be motivated
you have to try to not gain the freshman
15 because I know a lot of people do and
that's fine your metabolism is gonna
change you are becoming an adult and
retitle ism will probably slow down
because you're not a teenager anymore
that's just like burning through so many
calories and I know that happens to a
lot of people so when you become an
adult
your metabolism does change and just
recognize that and try your best to have
the body that you want to have if you're
okay with getting 15 pounds go for it
like that's fine but you know what I'm
saying just keep that in mind okay and
my final and 12 tip is that long
distance relationships can work my
relationship with Justin wasn't that
long distance because he was only like
30 miles away from me which was like an
hour on the team like a 30 minute car
ride but we couldn't really see each
other that much just because he had
soccer and we had academics and you know
we're like busy doing our own things in
college even though it's not really long
distance it's still like a distance like
in high school we would see each other
every single day of school it changed a
lot in college so I would just say what
you need for that is like trust number
one communication number two like
definitely communicate with each other
be completely honest like you just
really have to stay in touch with each
other like
I mean if you're not the type of person
that is gonna text your boyfriend all
the time like that's fine but like me
and Justin texts all the time that's
just how we are I know some people don't
that's fine too
but really just communicate with them
like everything you're feeling and they
can work I know a lot of people break up
before college and that's fine if you do
if you want to meet new people
experience new things that I understand
that but if you think you have a special
relationship with someone that you don't
want to break it off I'm here to tell
you they can work so yeah like I said go
