guys
he's currently 559 very early I'm up
before the Sun today look at pretty
Boston is so that's my wall right there
windows and then we've got the three
like freshman sophomore dorms and then
Nickerson Field is right there I like
getting up early in general because I
find that it makes me like way more
productive and like working out early in
the morning is just what I like to do
best and if I don't work out like right
as I get up I feel like I just don't at
all cuz I just get busy and find other
things to do so a lot of mornings I will
get up as early as I can so I'm having 7
sometimes it's 8 and I went to bed at
2:30 last night so I really didn't sleep
at all look I feel great and I woke up
literally before my alarm at 5:55 I was
like I'm ready like I got energy I'm
ready to go so now I'm just headed it to
the bathroom let to it get ready for the
morning I'm going to be a brushing my
teeth washing my face I've actually been
using a bio clarity it's just a
three-step system of a cleanser a
treatment and a restoring gel so right
now I'm just cleansing my face with a
cleanser I like to rub it around a lot
get it nice and soapy and I've been
loving using bio clarity if you guys saw
in my vlogs because it's actually
plant-based and that means a lot to me
and I've just really been enjoying it to
hang it out over the past couple of
weeks and I'm going to be using the
treatment which is the second step
it's a lecture okay that's accept away
are we going to the gym yeah
just film another 100 team government so
that way you can study more you mean oh
yeah because you we're gonna we give up
four and I like the second step because
I'm actually allergic to benzoyl
peroxide put this head salicylic acid in
it which is really good for my acne
prone skin now moving on to the third
step which is just at the restoring gel
there's all sorts of good vitamins in
there like vitamin C I know you can see
it results in as little as two weeks so
I would still recommend trying out by
klarity and you can use this discount
code to get some sweet discounts on file
clarity I will also have it links down
below in the description box in case you
forget and thank you so much bio clarity
for sponsoring this video
and then you just saw Taylor Mia
brushing our teeth okay another thing
I've been doing it's just like roughly
making my bed and I mean like roughly
like barely just be good then later on I
feel like I like said my bed and like do
work but if it's like not kind of made
and like a mess I think makes me
comfortable I like kids if I don't hurry
cuz it's getting late already my late I
mean like fixed time it so fun that
we're going together just like in film
Kantar hates when I crack my neck
in mine it sounds I haven't gonna do
like what time is this Sun actually rise
like 6:45 or like 7:00 I think I would
say so perhaps I supposed Muni me and
even you can possible call me beat me if
I like never come in farik before but I
feel okay right now just like before
6:30 so I feel like kind of safe you
know and like I said I just love it
starting out my mornings it'll work out
I think it just makes me so productive
it wakes me up and just makes me feel
really good just starts the day off I
know really a positive no it's really
fun to go with your buddies and me and
Taylor come back nice and sweaty and fun
I was doing so quick
are you sponsor and tailors making its
movie cause this is like a typical
morning thing because I make that a lot
and I guess today I'm trying out Harper
to the founder because games man
well you do both types of almond milk oh
okay I'll sit down I need to go a shower
and like be productive just showered
tailor made me a smoothie Bowl and it
looks so good I just added some honey
and peanut butter on top so it's like
not only that you feel like it was cute
before I know butters you know what what
it is yeah you're so good and studious
so I just finished doing my makeup I
didn't figure out show at all see this
is just like a morning routine but I can
show at this makeup in like another
video guys wanted and I know it's a lot
but it's because I didn't mention this
yeah I have my own feet deep party
tonight the dress I'm wearing in the
wheelchair yeah you can't tell but it's
this color it's really pretty and it's
kind of like a rapid dressing you thingy
from honey bunk please
I'm never going to be looser dining
really quick so we can make chitchat so
I pretty much ready a I'll probably be
like melon and stuff there then I got to
go to dry bar because normally after I
work out morning I would wash my hair
but today I didn't because dry bar send
a party play console before come back
get ready really quick and go to a party
because it starts at 8:00 but then we
