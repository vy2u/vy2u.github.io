video for you guys it's actually a haul
video of just like sweet decor or but
this is just stuff that I picked up from
society6 that you would decorate my
suite
and if you guys want to sweet to wear I
definitely give this video a thumbs up
so I know you do because I've been
thinking about filming one if you guys
didn't know like everything that I got
for my dorm room is from society6 like
all my decor like this tapestry and
actually you can see it all in my dorm
room tour which I actually just post it
I'll have it linked down below but just
figure that I want to get a bunch of
other stuff from society6 for my suite
just to liven it up and make it look
pretty so some stuff I got for the
bathroom and most of the stuff I got for
like our common room because it's like
really pretty and nice in like the
corner and there's like windows and a TV
and it just would look really nice with
some decorations so the first few things
that I actually say guys about I already
hung up so I'm gonna insert some video
clips of them right here but the first
half of Street I got is like a floral
pattern and like a world map I just like
a white background okay I love like the
map design and tapestries I think
they're so pretty and I really like that
it's floral I just think it's so cute
and like obviously we're all girls nice
week so it's really girly and cute and I
just have it hanging like right as you
walk into the suite so it looks really
pretty for like anyone that comes in and
then the next tapestry I got is so cute
ooh I love it it's just all black and
then there's white phases of the Moon
and I actually put in my common room and
everyone my suite really likes way that
looks to it it reminds me that brandy
melville t-shirt you guys don't talk
about that is black graphic tee with
white phases of the moon anyway it just
looks really cute in our common room and
I knew I wanted to get one that is like
neutral because we have a lot of other
colors that are in decorations in our
commoner so I knew I wanted the tapestry
to be like more low-key you know what
I'm saying I got I think is so cute for
my bathroom and I share my bathroom with
Katie and I'm Taylor and I just got this
little hand towel for a bathroom
look so cute on our towel rack it says
hello sunshine
and it's just white and like gold and it
was little pattern and I think it's so
cute and it's good that we have a nice
little towel hanging under our sinks we
can dry our hands I got this a bath
towel which is just this light pink like
rose print and I got this specifically
to go in our bathroom on this
rack that's hanging like above our
toilet because you can like always see
the towel that's hanging there so I
wanted it to be a pretty one
Thanks so pretty I want if I didn't
mention everything that I'm showing you
is obviously from society6 like I said
because I just like love their decor and
everything will be linked down below so
you can check it out if you are
interested also for anything on society6
you can get 10% off and free shipping
and use my code at Quechan hookup so
definitely go check that out making use
of that I know my friends have used it
and they're like Russian like seriously
it's like so great that you have that
code because shipping can get expensive
and you're like it makes it cheaper for
involves so definitely utilize that if
you're looking for some nice decor can I
have this pillow for the common room as
well and asked to go specifically on
this one chair or else it clashes with
the print of the couch the furniture
that came in our con room is like
provided by PU so we can like switch it
up for anything so cuz I just got to go
I'm like a more like a neutral chair but
it's just this really cool this
herringbone I don't even know heirloom
and bronze Chevron something like that
gray and white print and it's just a
really cute pillow and I got like the
pillow cover as well as a pillow insert
from society things and again try and
keep it like neutral said I want to go
like crazy with the colors because what
I'm about to show you guys I had an idea
of like a gallery wall for a commenter
and I'm so excited until I put this
together like right after I show you all
these individual things
I'm gonna go assemble it on the wall and
it looks really cute and you know I'll
insert a clip of it because it's gonna
look really fab but I'm gonna do it in
like right after from this video so the
first picture I got can we just
I think it's the cutest thing ever and I
was looking through society6 I saw this
and it really spoke to me so obviously
since we go to be you like vo Terriers
you know you know I knew I wanted
something to do with like lost in our
video so I found this cute little
Terrier and it's like this pretty like I
don't even know what those different
colors are like rainbow print I don't
even know but as you can see really
pretty but I just really like it and
this is gonna be this tantrum the
gallery well in my head it looks really
good hopefully like turns out is good so
yeah
oh man also see you guys know they got a
lot of got a lot of questions when I
showed different pictures I didn't stuff
that I got from society states before so
like another picture I got is this one
and they're both obviously like
rectangle but this is mini this is like
the mini size I don't know if you
tell public it is like compared to me as
a human being and then this is small so
this is like actually pretty big I would
consider this like medium or like large
generally but this is actually the small
one so I remember I was going to get the
large and the house look wait got you
know they're like really big so this
small say you know and then like I just
showed you the next one I got for the
gallery wall is this cool like ice cream
cone but look it's like the person's
nails that are laying it
it's like sprinkles and it's a rainbow
sprinkles like I don't know I just look
so sick it's been really cool and like
see like both of these are obviously
like colorful or like hot with colorful
things in them so I didn't again want to
get like a crazy tapestry and then to go
on that calorie wall as well I got this
little picture it says enjoy life eat
cake and I just think it's like so cute
and again it goes with kind of like the
white in like like different color theme
and then I thought to go once a color
well I feel like count how many times I
say gallery well and like society6 in
this video but this clock and it is just
the like outline of Boston like I just
think it's really cute and like it's
black and white oh my gosh you can even
see the gallery wall I have on my wall
in my room and the reflection of the
clock in the video okay like those
pictures those are open study things -
I'm obsessed yeah this is just like the
outline of Boston and to look really
cute on set gallery well then I guess
this square photo to form you guessed it
it's gonna go on the gallery wall and
it's just like black and white okay this
is a really very Sigma is actually
really embarrassing so I thought that
this was Boston right like I just like
this seems like it's a city must be
Boston and I like showing all my
suitemates when I got all this stuff I'm
like look at guys they're like retching
like that's not Boston and I was like oh
well we're just gonna pretend okay like
this is like the New York City tapestry
from society6 and I mean the question is
and I kind of really got that when you
like go to bu and live in boss and I'm
like well I mean whatever I love New
York City to is like it's good and this
I think is just cold night like that's
like what it's called in Spidey six so I
just like assumed that it was Boston but
I really think it's like probably New
York City or something but regardless
it's still really cute yeah yep yeah
you can get San Francisco it probably is
honestly I don't care it'll go with 15
petals okay so I got this phone case
whoo I actually really really love it I
had like a marble one before but it was
like it wasn't from society6 I literally
got so cheap I was like Amazon but it
was like kept cracking the corners and
it actually cut my hand once because it
was really sure and I always found my
phone okay whatever I'm that's the same
print as this towel it's just like this
light pink like rose flower print and I
feel so regal in like a girl I have like
I was like in class today who's sitting
like on my desk like face up I'm like
that's right everyone look at me I was
laughs your phone case so I really like
this I think it's really cute
I really recommend and I like okay I'm
really weird about foam pieces I don't
like them I'm really too thick and they
make my phone feel thicker because I'm
like I don't know I'm like not a fan I
just don't like the way it like feels
and I like this because it's like a
thinner but it's like it's like
protective and she know whatever yeah
okay moving on the last thing I got from
society6 is just this other picture
which is gonna go in my bathroom and
it's so cute and it's just like
flamingos and Taylor help me pick all of
these out because she shares my bathroom
with me and so does Katie and Emma and
then obviously all eight of us share the
common room I hope my teammates like
everything I got love you guys if you're
watching this video and also I got
everything like black braids because I
just like the aesthetic I think it looks
nice cuz you're just cute little Mingo
Smits just gonna go in her bathroom so I
really love everything that I got my
society6 I think it's so cute and if I
didn't mention before if you were like
what is society6 if you have no idea I
think I mentioned it in my back to
school like dorm home vo basically I
believe this is my idea of it I might be
wrong but I think like pretty much like
any artist can go on there and like put
whatever art they have and they can
literally make it to anything so you can
get this woman going like a picture you
can get it like a blanket like this
blanket I got before I came back to
school it's like I was like an elephant
predominant like this is room society6
you can get it in a tapestry you can get
it in a pillow you can get it in a clock
you can get it in like a phone case like
freaking anything t-shirt so yeah I just
think it's so cool and I really like
everything that I got and if you guys

sweet leave me comment down below don't
forget catchin hookup look at you 10%
off and free shipping because they just
