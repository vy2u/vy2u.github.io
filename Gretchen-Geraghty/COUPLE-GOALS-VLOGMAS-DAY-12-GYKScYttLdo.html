let your heart
ready what a beautiful morning so guys I
decided to be fun to like show you a
little bit of footage when the shower
running so that's why I tried to take
that little bit with my phone we just
usually run like along the Charles
that'd be you because there's like
really good running paths here sorry
like so gross right now so usually I
mentioned it in like vlog missus logs
before that I'll run for like a really
long time but look at like a really low
heart rate just like nice and steady
like usually I'll try to do like between
one and a half in two hours of heart
rate like 150 s which is like a good
like steady um like rhythm like a good
steady heart rate to work out for a long
time but today Lucy and I have like a
lot going on so we just wanted to get
like a quick run so we just ran for like
45 minutes but my heart rate was really
high the whole time it was like 170 s I
showed you earlier like I still have
mine going right now from earlier so
that's why it says that I'll stop it so
it's been going for that long even
though we only really went for 45
minutes because I started a little
before and after how do I show like
average heart rate Lou so it says my
average was 156 but that's really
because I started it like before we read
in after it was really like literally
like high 160 s17 use the whole time and
my match is like 176 so that's a lot so
basically my point in telling you this
is if you're trying to get motivated to
like run and stuff but you can't run for
as long because maybe like your
endurance isn't really good or you're
just not used to running for a really
long time I would say run for shorter
distances like maybe half an hour 45
minutes but try to just get your heart
rate up higher so that um when you do
try to run for like a longer time you
can keep your heart rate in the 150s
and you can still go for a long while
because you're used to running faster
for a short amount of time if you know
what I mean
we're on our way back and we just had to
stop somewhere and I go to the bathroom
because I don't know about you guys but
Missy and I run be like it always makes
us have to pee so bad like I don't know
what it is but yes we're just gonna like
go back out and shower and get ready and
go to the Nutcracker tonight I'm so
excited
I slept - like 12:15 again today because
I stayed up till 4:30 editing vlogmas
these are my new shorts I showed you
guys that I got from Lou
like on sale my favorite ever especially
because lookit I can keep my ID in this
little pocket to get back into my dorm
building so it's so great we're just
gonna go back now so yeah if you have
any more questions about like running
and stuff like that just leave them down
below I know the other day too I
mentioned that I ran for like 11 and a
half miles in two hours and someone's
like you should go out look a faster
pace or something that's like more than
a 10-minute mile but no one guy walked
um like I did like interval so I walked
a while like in between whatever so yeah
my workouts for running like changed a
lot but I just like to keep like a good
basis of running because I think it
keeps your fitness up and high just like
winning so there's that wait before I go
my question of the day today is before I
forget it's actually really funny cuz
yesterday I was thinking this is going
to be my question of the day for
tomorrow and then a girl tweeted at me
I'll put your name right here because
you deserve a shout-out you like a read
my mind today she goes make the question
of the day what is your favorite flavor
of Ben and Jerry's and she said hers was
like Cherry Garcia I think and that's
literally what I was going to say his
question of the day so what is your
favorite flavor of Ben and Jerry's
coming down below sorry it's always
about food but yeah I just like hood a
lot and mine right now is probably fish
food I really love half baked so I
really love cookie dough oh yeah right
now it's probably fish food so what's
your favorite flavor of Ben and Jerry's
leave me comment down below sorry I'm
like so gross right now the only thing
about these on the carburetor watches is
you just have to know that they have
these little bands so they get really
sweaty yesterday because it's seven yeah
okay guys so I didn't even mention I
talked before about with our run however
it is vlogmas day 12 which means that it
is December 12 and it's Boston like the
Northeast and usually on December 12
it's like snowing I remember I think I
look back at welcome to stay 10 or 11
and it was like snow outside in Albany
and Boston's like just like Albany I'm
pretty sure right with the climate wise
yeah yeah
and then except it's 60 freakin degrees
out today guys so like I was so hot in a
long sleeve in shorts like really I
should have worn like a short sleeve or
a tank top but I dunno
it's so hot it's sunny so it makes it
feel like 70 and on my way back I
stopped by fit wreck the gym at bu and
they have this like healthy like
smoothie place because I was just
feeling miss movie you know we have a
final coming up we'll see has one final

in anthropology I know I walked to a
strawberry banana and you guys know I
always eat half Clif Bar before I work
