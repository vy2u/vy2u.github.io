them right now baby girl what's your
name
let me talk to you let me buy you a
drink let me buy you a drink oh I just
thought of a crazy idea what if I sing
you a song at the beginning of every
video would that be obnoxious I'm in
enough uhm noxious mood anywho wait hi
everyone I didn't even say that that was
weird I usually say hey everyone but
today we're gonna have a little Express
haul going on for you I'm so excited I
literally got so many clothes and I'm in
a mood right now if you can tell I just
logged in I said that because I just got
back from his SoulCycle so I'm in a mood
I'm just like really hyper and use the
code three four five five and you'll get
15% off all of Express and I think it's
through a May 31st yeah that's right so
just so you know because then you can
get cute stuff like me or if you like
other stuff on Express you can get it
with the code three four or five five
you'll get 15% off which is really great
because Express already isn't like too
expensive Joe I'm gonna show you all the
clothes I got because they're like
really cute like I got the messer in the
mail and I was like hey like they're so
cute I've been obsessed with skirts
let's just start with this little guy
okay he's so cute I mean no it's a girl
she's really cute um it is a light wash
denim skirt and I love the rips I think
it's so cute and like flattering and
like look at the top of that little guy
right there I like love how it looks
it's just a cow okay
so there's that and then another script
let me just show you all the skirts
first I got this white skirt because
doesn't this look at the lf1 do you guys
aren't talking about there's a white
shirt that looks just like this like
that zippers up and down in the front
with the LFO and I remember when I went
they only had like a size 23 left and I
was in yo girl is not as I'm 2030 she's
like a 27 don't you think sometimes at a
good day but like a 27 so anyway so I
got this white skirt from expresso and I
guess I'll tell you this sizes if that
can be helpful so like I said my waist
looking 27 and then the skirts I got a
four because I remember in skirts that I
got before from expressing before but in
jeans I know I get twos I don't know why
that is but anyhow okay yeah so this
white skirts really cute reminds me of
the lf1 it's probably cheaper though
because L
is like mad expensive oh we got this
camo skirt I lit it online and I was
like hey girl like this is so cute and
um I just think it's really fun I'm
gonna try to chill now yeah I really
enjoy that okay oh then I got some like
basics to go with this curtsy I'm saying
I think I don't have that many basic
things because I'm like psycho and I
just like getting a crazy printed stuff
so I got this plain black shirt and this
is a softest thing thing I've ever felt
oh my god it's like really soft and like
stretchy do you guys don't like brandy
melville like that like classic brandy
melville material you know I'm talking
about Hannah that really soft stretching
material that's what this is but it's
like even softer and I really enjoy this
okay this is like really nice and then I
also got this is like a different
material though this is just more like a
normal cotton II type t-shirt but I got
a white one cuz I don't have like plain
things like this and I need them oh and
then I got I think I'm running through
this hall I got this like ribbed
bodysuit like how cute is this guys and
it's just like caged in the back like
cage details I just like it straight
across in the front like that we think
this is really cute Hannah said that she
likes over the straps are nice and thick
with two C's so yeah that's how I feel
about that oh then this white top is mad
cute to the bodysuit or as a top okay oh
I really like that this has like this
sticky stuff Hannah you were just saying
that you like the sticky stuff on it so
that it makes it stay up we love it okay
so see it has like that sticky band
right there yes express you're doing
something right and you're doing a lot
of things right oh if you're wondering
what these balloons and streamers are
for Taylor decorated my room it's so
cute if you like saw on my Instagram
story or snapchat story or like um vlog
or anything like I literally cried when
I got one said that it was so cute and
there's balloons all over my room I now
you can just see this one yellow one and
there's a happy birthday sign right
there he's just so sweet
okay back to the black shirt it like
ties in the front
it's like strapless it looks like a
little bandeau top can it be an opiate
top
I don't know but it's like longer so it
like covers your whole stomach you know
whatever it's cute it's like a tube top
that's what it's called
okay then another plane
be sure this blue color is like my
favorite blue color of all time I swear
I've had like three shirts this color in
the past and I don't know where they are
anymore but this one's really cute
it's like short-sleeve and just like
slouchy and comfy and I'm all about the
comfy clearly I loved how my sweatshirt
zipped all the way up like Who am I who
do I think I am oh then I saw these
basic little camis on there and I feel
like I'm like back in seventh grade
again when I would wear like Aeropostale
camis like pull them down
remember the cami pull the dreaded cami
ba and you would wear you'd wear your
long cami with like a short sleeve like
Abercrombie t-shirt over it but you
could see your like arrow Postell cami
underneath you know I'm talking about
over you're like you're like skinny
jeans I got a white cami but this is
just a normal cami it's a cool cami
because it's like straight across you
know what I mean like that little trend
just like the little just like straight
and the talked and I was like heck yeah
I like that so I enjoy this I kind of
wish it's just small like I know she got
an extra small though because it looks
kind of big but like it'll be fine
all my clothes don't even a skin-tight
that's my dad tells me thank you have it
in black as well yeah
Wow I've been doing this like really
quick I hope you guys don't mind like
quicker haul videos I thought I did so
many things like I do I'm just like
talking really quick cuz I'm in a mood I
told you before okay this is a black
bralette and you could almost wear this
as a sports bra it feels like a sports
raw material kind of maybe the line is
so low another time but um it's just
like a black bra let I have like zero
Brawl that's like a little you know
Hannah I have literally one black bra
that I think right yeah I literally have
not remember the Abercrombie one the
really old old trusty yeah I needed a
bra like blow up so here we go this is
it it's just like a plain black bra year
I just made it before it okay I got
these James look you know cute these
jeans I'm gonna scream they're just like
medium wash I would say they're in a 2l
because I'm long no I just have like
long legs actually I think my legs
aren't that long
you say yeah I feel guy with a long
torso I have a long torso and long legs
because I'm tall okay so there we go
mystery stuff and the bottoms of these
jeans are like mad cute you don't even
saying they're like really cool they're
like all like distressed looking and I
love that vibe like Louie says jeans
like this and I'm always like dang girl
I'm gonna steal those jeans so now we
don't have to appease and there's like a
rim so down the front and I think they
might be like mid-rise oh my gosh it
says ankle legging legging these are
jeans well ankle legging mid-rise I knew
it I knew their mid-rise um so these are
them
and I really enjoyed them okay last but
not least we have this jacket that I
didn't know Hanna has the same exact one
don't you like the exact one she has
four colors of it so you heard it here
first ladies and gentlemen it's a good
jacket because it has it in four colors
so go get you one want to say hi oh no
you're naked again so I got this brown
camel color I would call it you think
this is camel I would definitely say
camel I just think of Quinta this is a
true camel color ladies and gents oh and
I got it in a medium I like I was
younger I thought I was smaller than I
was but now I think I think I'm bigger
than I am yeah and Hannah has an extra
small I need to go get it in a small
because I'm like I probably smell on
this just the sleeves are kind of long
and I wanted to be like smaller fitting
yeah she just says a leather jacket is
best and with the medium could be good
if you wanted like put like a sweatshirt
on her maybe I don't know but I just
want it to be like kinda small like
tighter so anyway today I think I'm
gonna go exchange it first mall but I
really really like this I think it's
really cute and I didn't have like a
black blouse a brown leather jacket I
just had like a black one alright you
know I have three black ones I bought
confirm gonna buy a black one from all
stains and then a black one from Zara
and I love all of them for different
reasons they're all very different you
could never go out and do a leather
jacket but this brown one I just needed
to incorporate in my life cuz I didn't
have a brown one hey my German couldn't
wear leather jackets like I feel like in
high school
I like what I got and made fun of
you know name like they were like too
cool and trying to like ever gonna be
like oh like who do you think you are
you know what I mean but then I came to
college and I was like screw everyone
I'm getting a leather jacket yeah cuz
you're like adult and mature like I feel
like leather jackets whenever I put on
the leather jacket I feel like badass
like I feel so mature you know anyway
