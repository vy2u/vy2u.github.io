where to begin
um I don't even know how I'm going to
title this video like how would you
title a video like this I just don't
know
I'm not even added this video that much
at all because I just want it to be like
me and like myself just talking to you
guys like you're my friends that's
really the only reason I'm making this
video it's because I consider so many of
you like honestly like close friends I
just care about you all so much so I
really felt like I just owed an
explanation to you all so today is
September 29th and I'm filling this
video right now like I said really gonna
edit and I'm just gonna throw it up
right after I finish explaining this
situation to you so I'm just gonna come
out and say it uh my boyfriend mm my boy
you guys know my boyfriend Justin we
dated for three years and we actually
decided to break up recently so wow I
never thought I would be ready to
actually say that it still feels weird
so the reason I'm just telling you in
the first place because I feel like some
people some people's opinions are kind
of like Gretchen you don't need to share
everything on YouTube which I understand
but at the same time it was my decision
to bring him onto my youtube channel so
much and make him so much in my social
media like make him present you know God
this is art okay yeah I just brought him
onto my butt yeah what am I even saying
I
not gonna cry hold on okay okay what was
I saying so basically my decision to
make this video is tempt from the fact
that I I'm the one who brought him on to
YouTube I'm the one who has put him up
in so many pictures of Instagram and
Twitter you know like I would talk about
I am like I just made my personal life
so open in public with you guys which is
fine because I love doing that I just
love being like relatable and like being
like a friend like I want to be as open
as possible but with certain situations
it gets tough like when you break up
with a boyfriend also another huge
reason I decided to film this video is
because I'm actually flying out to New
York tomorrow for beautycon New York
City and I'm gonna be meeting so many of
you wonderful human beings again I can't
wait like I just love meeting you guys
so much I would meet so many of you at
beautycon New York City like just warms
my heart essentially I didn't want to
make a video at all about this but like
I said I just really think I owe it to
guys like right after we decided to
break up I was like I'm never gonna be
ready to talk about this like ever on
YouTube but you know again I just really
feel like I owe you guys an explanation
and I know some of you probably think
like oh you don't need to tell us but
like no like I wanted to because I know
I made my personal life so open and I'm
gonna meet so many of you this weekend
and I knew that I wouldn't be able to
handle like face-to-face talking and
meeting with you guys you guys talking I
wouldn't be able to lie and pretend like
things are okay and be I didn't want to
just like spring it on you guys that we
broke up when you would have had like no
idea you know what I mean
and right now I'm in a lot better of a
spot that I was like about two weeks ago
and we decided to break it off so if
you're wondering Gretchen why did you
guys break up so Justin and I decided
that we should break up because we've
been dating almost three years and yeah
we started dating when we were 16 we've
been dating for a while it just kind of
wasn't working out you know with we go
to different colleges and I mean that
happens it's hard in college when you go
to different colleges they're still
friends like it's gonna be okay like
when you're in the middle of a breakup
it it's easy to think like oh this isn't
gonna be okay it's so different but like
you're just so used to each other and
you're so comfortable with each other
but sometimes sometimes you have to be
uncomfortable in life and you have to
push yourself to grow and just accept
being uncomfortable because that is
ultimately what's going to make you grow
I don't know if that's making any sense
I don't want any of you guys to worry or
feel bad or feel sad like we both just
ultimately decided that that was the
best decision for us and I I'm truly the
type of person that feels like God has a
plan for all of us
everyone has their purpose in life
everyone I don't mean to get too deep
but really I truly feel that like
everyone is meant to be with someone and
everyone's course through our life is
like planned out like everyone has a
plan so if we're not going to be
together right now I think that's okay
and I think that we're meant to end up
together that we will again if God wants
us to be together I think we will in the
future that's not like off the table
like I said we're still friends we're on
very good terms and if you're wondering
I actually asked if I can make this
video and he agreed because we're on
good terms I didn't want to make anyone
upset I know this maybe probably comes
as a shock to a lot of you and I know
probably a lot of our family and friends
will see this video and I just want to
say like we're okay don't worry about it
too much so I think that's it uh wow
this is so weird that I friendly
addressed we broke up it's okay I'm good
he's good we're all good like people
have to go through breakups in life
thank you guys for watching and I'll see
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
