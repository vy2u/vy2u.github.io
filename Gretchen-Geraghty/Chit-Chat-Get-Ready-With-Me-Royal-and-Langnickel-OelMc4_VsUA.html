chit chat get ready with me video and
I've never filmed one of these videos
before so bear with me I know I'm like a
newbie but they've always just seemed
like so much fun for me to like film one
and I've always wanted to so I'm really
happy I decided to do one today
and also I'm going to using all these
wonderful brushes they're from royal and
langnickel and these are just from two
different brush sets one is purple and
one is pink as you can see and they are
just from the Mota collection I believe
that's what they're called and like I
said they're all from royal and
langnickel so I'll have this test link
down below and you can use the code GG
20 for 20% off your purchase and you
want to see how I achieved this look
just keep on watching so I've never done
one of these types of videos before I
don't know if you guys have noticed that
I've never done one of these but I've
seen him a lot and they look really fun
so I just thought I would give it a go
and I guess the first thing I will be
doing is just kind of pushing my hair
back behind my ears I don't have a hair
tie with me so we're just gonna go like
that also right now my skin isn't like
amazing as you can see there's a lot of
like redness some blemishes and just
like acne scarring I have like a scab
right there I don't even know so yeah my
skin is ready moisturize I think I
should mention that first it is with the
Cetaphil cream I usually use the like
day moisturizer well you can see the
vein Domanick right now that's weird
usually I just use like the daily like
moisturizer during the day but my skin
has been feeling really dry recently so
I use the cream at night and I just use
the cream during the day today too so
ice creams feeling like pretty oily
right now but it'll be okay with makeup
and I'm actually gonna be using this lip
brush first for my concealer and it's
weird because obviously it's not for
concealer but I always like using little
brushes for concealer in the concealer
I'm gonna use and that I always use is
the bare minerals concealer in the shade
light too so we're just gonna go like
this and put it on my blemishes hey this
is working pretty well for not being a
concealer brush and it's weird having to
talk right now doing my makeup because
usually when I do my makeup
I'm just very focused and I don't talk
at all but if I try really hard I think
I can just kind of fun it's like having
a friend to talk to you while you do
your makeup and I kind of like go ham
with concealer if you can't tell like
I'm gonna be concealing for a while just
because then I don't have to wear
good foundation and sometimes I do wear
liquid foundation with BB cream you know
I'm just not feeling me today I'm like
pretty hot it's like really odd oh and
I'm just gonna be doing this also too I
think with like a high coverage
foundation powder you don't necessarily
need like a BB cream or foundation
unless you like really high coverage but
sometimes like I said I do do that
and right now Justin's downstairs
actually playing with Teddy and I'm
really excited because we Wow it's hard
to speak I'm really excited because
we're all filming a video together Lucy
me and Justin we're filming I don't even
know exactly what it's called it's like
boyfriend versus sister tag or something
like see who knows more about me
so that'll be really exciting I know he
hasn't been and like a sit down video my
channel in awhile but he actually found
this one and was like this would be so
fun if we did this with Lucy so we're
gonna do that and I wonder if it's gonna
be it before after this video probably
after so yeah get really excited because
I know it's just gonna be so fun pop
this little brush it's doing really well
for concealer I might just keep using
this because you know I figured like I
don't really use lip brushes I know some
people do but I'm not even really into
lips that much like it's hard enough for
me to just put on the gloss so I don't
really go all out and use like lip
brushes or whatever wow I actually
should have put on my BB cream or
foundation or something since really
filming a video after but you know it's
whatever I just like to keep it pretty
natural and I'm saying that although I
put in like the Urban Decay smoky
palette in my bag because I haven't
really used it much and I was like
getting mad at myself yesterday I'm like
GOC and like you literally have not used
this once and you got it like forever
ago so I decided I'm just gonna wing it
and try to do something fun with that
because I literally never wear eyeshadow
but I'm like okay I'm gonna wear
eyeshadow for this video like I'm gonna
make myself wear some eyeshadow in fact
I am glb and I barely ever make Beauty
videos so I'm just trying my best you
know I feel like I really am NOT like
that skilled with makeup when people are
like crunchy and shut up like obviously
you are like your crotch on my booty but
like no like I feel like most of my
videos have been like fashion and stuff
and I just like really am NOT that that
good at makeup I like
I am but like really I'm not you know
well now that I've been concealing for a
freaking year I don't know if you can
tell my concealer is actually a little
bit lighter than my skin right now
because I get pretty tan from
lifeguarding but I don't let that bother
me because then I just kind of blend it
all in with like bronzer and powder and
stuff so then the next step I do is my
under eye concealer and this is the
Garnier skin renew anti dark circle
roller and light/medium and I just go
like that and also to what I realized
recently that I like doing is I like
bringing it down like that and then I
have the really light like under eye
look and I just really like how that
looks so I just slap a lot of that on
there and then I just kind of blend it
in my finger this might be easier with a
brush I'm just gonna use a foundation
brush to blend in this concealer to make
it a little bit easier and yeah like I
said I'm really excited to like film
this video with Justin because I do
least Betty I'm like vlogs a bunch but I
think really the only like official
sit-down video he's been in on my
channel was the boyfriend tag which was
three years ago I feel like two and a
half three years ago it's been like a
really long time so what this has been
and long overdue wow that looks really
light in my nose looks really red I
literally got like summer yesterday and
probably cause splotchy for my concealer
but like I said I'll fix it all right so
then I'm gonna use this powder brush and
I'm just using this light mineralized
Mac skin finish natural look I'm running
out there's like the pan in the shade
light plus so I'm just gonna put this
under my eyes I keep forgetting to talk
sorry
also I just put it like in the middle of
my face like where I want it to be like
lighter and more highlighted you know
what I'm saying and I've realized
recently too that like I can just put
bronzer look towards like the outside of
my face to make it look kind of more
like contoured and stuff and then I
don't even need really like a strong
contour you know what I'm saying
and then of the same powder brush I'm
just gonna go in with NARS Laguna
bronzer which is just one of my favorite
dark ones and this one's really good
because you can use it for just like an
overall like bronzy look or you can use
it to like really contour too and I just
kind of do it for looking more like
bronzy look like I kind of concentrate
it right there you know I just do like
this
like guys I'm really not that skilled I
just do I feel like I just copy what
everyone else does and I just like put
it right there and then on this side I
don't like cover it with this mirror and
all right here I'm supposed to be
talking about other things I feel like
and not my makeup okay then I just
blended down my neck but in other news I
know one of you guys have commented like
on blogs and stuff that it's that
Justin's Bennet I feel like I just keep
talking out Justin but he's just what
I'm thinking about right now because
he's downstairs playing with Teddy and I
know a lot of you have been commenting
like Gretchen like he's not that nice to
you and blah blah blah like why does he
mean to you blah blah blah he really
doesn't like being on cameras hence like
why he hasn't been in a video in like
two years like actually like sitting
down or whatever wait really when was
that that was let me think we filmed it
January three months after we started
dating and we've been dating for three
years in October so that means that it's
been like two and a half years really
since we filmed a video like sitting
down so basically like if you guys are
thinking that he's being like mean on
vlogs and stuff it's just because like
he's really just like doesn't like being
in videos that much and it's usually
because I'm like please be in a video
and he's like okay so yeah he really
isn't that mean to be like you don't
need to worry about it in the same
powder brush is actually blue and just
got like pink the same powder brush is
actually pretty small too so I'm just
gonna use it for my blush as well which
I'm also just using a NARS line this is
just the shade orgasm and it has been
like my favorite of all time I put
everything I'm showing you stars well my
blush and my bronzer are just because
like they've been like my favorites for
like a really long time so I just
thought like why not stick to the
originals and it just is really pretty
like peachy pink like shimmery color I
don't know if you can tell it's just so
pretty I feel like I'm a culprit of
using like the same brush for everything
like when I do my makeup I use my big
fluffy powder brush for like everything
which is like what this is so it's
actually and I said it's kind of smaller
because then you can use it for bronzer
and blush like easier and also to you I
like a lot of blush because I feel like
I don't know until it kind of wears away
after a while and I just
look a blush and like a lot of it so I
usually wear a lot and I know this is
weird but I'm actually going to be using
this little shader brush right now to do
my highlight and I'm just using the
Becca highlighter in opal it's in the
shade opal and I just love using this
usually I use my fingers or I'll use
like a smaller brush I know this is like
really little but I just feel like it's
good or I just like dust it all along
there oh you know I like using this
little brush because I'm it's like right
in the spot that I wanted in you see
what I'm saying
I'm gonna use this from now on look at
that I'm already pretty dewy like on my
own so that's why I own these like a
little highlighter right there and now
we're gonna move on to eyes I feel like
this is such a throwback I'm gonna use
the Urban Decay eyeshadow primer potion
and just this little thing cause it's
like an old packaging I feel like it's
super super old like you probably you
guys are gonna be like oh my god that's
from four years ago or whatever honestly
it is cuz I really don't wanna show
doesn't much and when I first started
YouTube I was like everyone uses this
like I need it so naturally I got it and
like used it like twice because I really
don't want a shadow but like I said I'm
just gonna like go for it in this video
because I'm filming a video after it and
I like to wear like more makeup when I'm
filming and sometimes I just like try to
wear eyeshadow whoo I also like to put
the parameter potion like on our knees a
little bit because I like to put
eyeshadow like down there it feels now
I'm gonna be using this crease smudge
brush which is really cool because I
think this is like just smudge it out
and this is like for your crease but
since this is so dense as you can see
I'm gonna use it to like really pass the
eyeshadow like on my lids and if I
mentioned it before I'm gonna be using
the urban decay naked smoky palette and
what color should I use mmm oh my gosh
guys I hate myself I told you I've used
it like once I would literally used it
ones like look it I was like why does
the mirror look all blurry it's cuz I
still a it's like what's this called
like film on it wow I hate myself I need
to like use my things whoa look at that
this is like the clearest mirror ever
this is insane and also if you can't
tell I'm filming with my blog camera
right now I'm just gonna talk about this
for a little bit so basically I have my
like big DSLR camera in this little vlog
camera but I realized like this little
vlog camera literally
better quality than my big DSLR camera
and I talked out in a blog and I was
like why is this happening like my DSLR
when I feel like is what you're supposed
to use to like sit down and film a video
like I feel like it's supposed to be
better so like why isn't it good I mean
use the shade a more right now that
little guy I think I'm gonna use those
two yeah back to the camera so basically
someone told me like okay Gretchen like
you have the Canon Rebel t3i and like
the thing is the lens that it comes with
oh this is pretty
they're like the lens that it comes with
is like not good they're like you need
to like get like a better lens so I
realized I probably have to like buy
like a more expensive lens to go with my
DSLR or else my vlog camera is looking
at better quality I was like what is
going on
that's dark but you know it's coming
it's gonna end up loading good I swear
it's supposed to be smoky right see this
is why I don't wear eyeshadow cuz I'm
like not good at it and everyone thinks
I am but I'm not in whatever like my
friends will be like oh my gosh for prom
like do my makeup or like whatever and
I'm like okay you're literally gonna
come out looking like crazy pants but we
just we just try our best at all you can
do right oh yeah so if I just said
basically to conclude I need to get a
new lens for my DSLR if I feel like it
and also to what's annoying is like
they're just so expensive and I'm like
literally I already spent so much money
on my camera cuz I bought it like I
really bought the t3i like right as it
came out like so long ago but I've just
been filming with like I guess like the
bad like startup lens that it comes up
like it's not bad by any means but like
it could be better and so like I feel
like I spend so much money on that
camera that I like to win a violin whoo
and we already have a big puffy side on
the other end so I'm gonna use that with
but I wanted to use radar but now that I
just put that all over my lid I don't
think I can really use that anymore so I
might just use like these two colors
like the purple in the black to like
blend into my crease in like the outside
corner you know and also to eyes notice
like I have really really huge eyelids
like so big like when I got my makeup
done it Chanel she's like well you like
big eyelids like they're like perfect
for eyeshadow so that's why I feel like
I can't really do makeup on other people
too because I've so much room to work
with like a look at these puppies but
like other people have like smaller
eyelids like my twin sister so it's like
harder to work with you know
wait I just found this pretty dark color
it's called whiskey so I might use that
a bit let's see what happens
whoo that's nice
I literally don't know what I'm doing
like I really don't I'm just like
winging it but makeup should be fun when
I was in ninth grade my first start of
youtube like I started it I remember I
started my channel April 1st of freshman
year which was oh my gosh like a little
over four years ago I remember I just
had like so much fun with makeup and
like I really didn't start wearing
makeup yeah and if anything it watch my
first video ever like if any of you are
still here Congrats you like made it so
far but um if any of you are still here
like I literally I'm on my first video I
said I called it daily makeup routine at
that point I literally like did not wear
makeup to school and I like pretended
like I worth so much makeup so I could
show you guys like all this make it like
to put on but really I like did not wear
that much makeup and so it's like really
funny looking back because I like I
really went all out and you like a
shuttle like this with like this big
urban decay like I don't even know what
it was Book of Shadows that's what it
was so other than any of you remember
that and really I like never actually
did that so that's funny
I'm gonna use the other end again to
just smudge some of that brown and maybe
the shiny Brown called your braids are
down here because I just feel like that
looks good when you do that and up sorry
I really can't talk when I do eye makeup
I get to focus like when I do my
eyeliner and forget it I'm not gonna
really talk at all I'm gonna up like
insert some music and I know it supposed
to be like a chitchat video but like I
just get way too focused look I'm not
kidding when I do my own I really hold
my breath holy music you scared the crap
out of me Justin I was so scary
I'm talking to them when I doing makeup
do you wanna know what this video is
called
it's called to check it ready with me
liked it childlike you talk except I was
just telling them it's really hard to
talk and do you make about the same time
I made it really dark to like it doesn't
look funny no it really is okay now I'm
gonna use the angle I shadow brush
straight and I think this is like to do
like I showed on your crease but I'm
just gonna use it cuz it's big and puffy
you want me to use that one smolder okay
okay well wait now I have to go back to
my first brush though no no no it's
actually pretty that is purple pink
uh well smolders purpley so I'll put it
that that's not the English oh here oh
you're really confusing me Justin you're
like really confusing me okay I'm back
to using this brush and I put it more in
the outside corner this is I think this
is the crease and then okay so back to
now I'm gonna actually use an English
shadow and do a brow bone highlight with
the color thirteen it's just like the
lightest one and you go like that
Selleck alright what are you doing I was
talking about you like for the whole
beginning and my camera but on the video
I think this does not look okay does
that look low right it's kind of dark in
a lot and I really don't know what I'm
doing but whatever okay no would you say
what brush okay well I guess I'm just
mmm he peed on you okay I'm just gonna
use this like dense end of this brush
again and I'm gonna use a total focus
that's good I'm gonna use the color
called high and put it from the inside
corner as a little highlight Justin do
you want to talk to them wait you
actually have to talk to them when I'm
doing my eyeliner because like I won't
be able to speak now is it a good guy
okay oh now that do my eyebrows any
laughing
cuz I've never done my eyebrows oh sorry
I think you're confused I know I really
didn't used to do them but I tried out
this sample it's the benefit gimme brow
but this isn't the sample anymore you
wanted me to hold it up again it's not
focusing okay it looks like that and I
used to use like the little sample I'm
really sorry this videos gonna be so
freaking long if you're still here
comment your favorite favorite type of
plan comment your favorite type of plan
if you're still here I'll be really
proud but basically I use like a sample
of this a while ago when I got it like
Sephora I think it was like points or
whatever they just like give it to you
when you buy stuff and then I really
liked it so I'm gonna use it except I
kind of still don't really know what I'm
doing in a lot of you like to comment on
my videos a lot telling me how screwed
up my eyebrows are and like sorry like I
really like do nothing to them a guy
will remember to pluck them or like do
them like once a month if I'm lucky
because I just like forget you know but
I know they get like really sit on the
ends but that's just like how they are
and everyone's like let your eyebrows
grow back but like you know like that's
like how they are naturally so I go like
this to make it look like I have more
eyebrow there even though it's like very
sparse
so good Justin yeah yeah you're not
supposed to it just makes it a little
bit like darker like see okay that's
like looking like sparse right there and
then you go like that
what is it thank you for giving me my
gosh oh dang it you're making me nervous
no don't leave now okay see like that
looks better now I think it's like a
little different yes what's going on in
the front your to go babysit
okay see ya are you ready to fill my
excited so something else I actually
learned along the way is that if you do
eyeliner well at least for me if I would
do eyeliner and then what are you doing
stop it stop Justin stop he's moving the
chair doesn't really stop five two
eyeliner and then come on eyelashes what
would happen is like when I would curl
my eyelashes he would like take some of
the eyeliner off so I learned that after
doing my eye shadow accra my eyelashes
then I do eyeliner on top so that it
doesn't take off the eyeliner so I go
like this I really can't talk when I'm
doing this either okay and then I
usually like run my fingers to them I
don't know why I always do that I don't
know why it's like a habit cuz I think I
might get like stuck together something
I don't really know you guys anything
mad that I'm like looking in the
viewfinder I just want to like look at
myself and make sure that my makeups
looking okay cuz all I have is like
these little mirrors to work with sorry
if you can tell that I'm looking there
and I'll say don't get mad at me oh my
god you guys ain't mad at me to you for
doing that you're like why are you
looking like in the viewfinder or not
like stop looking at your sounds like
look at us but like okay that just this
videos hard I'm uncomfortable I'm
nervous from this type before don't get
back to me okay just don't get mad also
another thing is if you've been watching
my videos for a while you'll know my
favorite pen eyeliner is the Stila like
waters before and stay all day and
that's what it's called and I lost it I
don't know how recently I lost it so
I've just been using the tarte precision
long wear liner and it looks like is
that it's basically the same thing as
the steel one just by Tarte and I just
draw a line like this like I said this
is gonna be really hard to talk during
so I'm just gonna enjoy some music right
here I'm sorry I try my best
that came out ok also another thing I'm
bad at is like making it thin like it's
usually way too thick and also I don't
know if you're supposed to do this I
think this might be against the rules of
like beauty but I at least kind of
robbed some of my um liquid eyeliner
that's it cold down here like under my
eye just cuz I like the way that looks
like til it's a Friday night so I just
have crossed eyes just there that's
embarrassing and that was really harsh
but it'll do we'll work with it cuz I
like yeah like I said just like the
defined a little look now I gotta do
this sigh so let's see whoa it's hard to
see this one I don't know why also
another thing is guys that actually have
glasses I just never wear them because I
like I remember what happened was like
for certain things I like couldn't see
like after I did a video for a while
like I said my eyes well this is base
coat they told me at the eye doctor my
eyes would get locked into focus so if I
was like edit a video for a while or I
have my phone there like something like
right here you know it would be hard
like I remember like walking around
campus or like even in high school like
walking around the hallways and like
people's faces would just look blurry
because my eyes were stuck in focus here
so like looking at something far away
would be like hearts like get my eyes to
focus you know so I got these glasses
but literally when I wear them it's more
blurry like I'm not even kidding so I
just like don't wear them and that just
happened sometimes and things just get a
little blurry but I guess it's ok for
some things people are sometimes I just
like deal with it so I'm really proud of
myself because usually I go like this
when I do my makeup I like pull my hair
like that and people have commented that
and goodie videos I've done before or
like go like that but right now I just
like did it like that was out pulling my
eye so I am proud of myself
ooh that came out kind of messy
basically I just do the same thing and I
realized I've been something for a while
now so I have got to hurry this up
purely you can tell I'm new at this type
of video ha
now I have this comb wash tape brush
like there's like a comb on this one and
like I think these are for your lashes
on this side but I'm just gonna come on
my eyebrows because I know I just did
that thing with the what's it called
benefit gimme brow but like I said like
right here in the front looks funny and
this is good because I can brush for the
whole thing with like adding more color
so this is definitely handy-dandy and
I'm happy I got this thing I'm actually
have two of the same brushes in these
two different sets I got they're called
brow so what I'm gonna use for brows if
I wanted to use like a powder for my
brows but when I'm just gonna use for
eyeliner cuz it's like that angled
eyeliner brush type thing and I'm gonna
be using the Mac black track like gel
eyeliner and I haven't used this in so
long like it's probably too old for me
to use but back in the day when I was
really into gel eyeliner I would use it
and I'm gonna put this on my lower
waterline to make it like really defined
and I'm just gonna go for like a really
heavy eye look because like I said I'm
like filming after this with Justin Aunt
Lucy so I think it'll like look okay to
have like really defined under my eyes
you know that's a really embarrassing
face I think we can't talk when I'm
doing this so I'm just gonna have to cut
this and come back and you'll see okay I
just did it can you tell my waterline is
black and now I'm gonna finally do my
mascara I'm using a L'Oreal telescopic
carbon black would you guys have known
has been my favorite forever and also
something else that I've learned
recently which makes makeup girl like
way faster is if you go see mascara on
the top and not on the bottom because I
always used to do the bottom two which I
still think looks good but if you just
do it on the top and because you go away
quicker and I kind of like the way it
looks to just have it defined on the top
and also something else I should mention
is that like I know I'm vegan out I know
someone was telling you that like
L'Oreal tests not animals so like this
is probably the last one of this all by
sadly because it's like my favorite
mascara but I'll just have to find you
know
my scarab and that is like good to
animals but this one's like getting
pretty old anyway and I've had it for a
while like before I went vegan like it's
probably like three months old to be
honest and I've been vegan for like mmm
a month and a half now so yeah good
enough for me
wait Jake I didn't do my lips yet so now
I'm gonna use the fresh sugar lip balm
from Sephora and then I'm going to use
the Chanel mm gloss Amer in the shade
131 if you can see that and usually I
don't use stuff from Chanel really like
I just went got my makeup done there
recently focus with you look it's good I
got my makeup done there recently so I
just didn't using this it's just look at
a light pink shiny one oh my gosh should
be stuck to the end look I'm so sorry I
know this is like so long and you're
probably like shut up retching wrong
right so yeah that is the finished look
and don't forget my code is Gigi 22 get
20% off of your purchase on royal and
langnickel brushes so yeah thank you so
much for watching and I'll see my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
