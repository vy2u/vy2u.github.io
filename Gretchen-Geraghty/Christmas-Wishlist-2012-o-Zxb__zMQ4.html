Christmas wishlist video or like holiday
wish this video was really requested and
I remember in my video before I asked
you guys if you wanted a wish this video
just to LIKE the video and so I think a
lot of people want to see it and some
people message me so I'm just going to
be telling you everything that I have on
my list for Christmas and definitely you
don't think I'm like a spoiled brat or
anything because everything that I'm
telling you I'm not gonna get for
Christmas like I told my parents to I'm
not expecting to get everything that I
wrote on my list just whatever they want
to get me is perfectly okay so yeah here
we go um first on my list is me and my
twin sister Lucy we have like conjoining
bathrooms and they're kind of old and
disgusting
so um the first thing on my list is to
redo those bathrooms like renovate them
you know and I don't know if that's
gonna be that's I guess that's like a
part of our Christmas present because
we're gonna start for animating them
like right after Christmas I'm pretty
sure and then the next thing on here is
a jewelry like wall armoire um it's just
this white one and it like opens up like
a cupboard kind of thing and then
there's drawers that you can put your
jewelry and I really want one because my
jewelry box right now is like tiny and
doesn't fit a lot of jewelry in it so I
want any one and then I can just put it
on the wall so that'll be like easy and
then the next thing I want is misty
Madden stone leather trooper boots in an
eight-and-a-half oh okay well whatever
that's like my shoe size I don't care if
that you know that and um
there yeah just combat boots and if you
haven't noticed my outfit weeks I wear
combat boots like constantly so um yeah
I just really want those ones cuz I
think they're a cool color like there
cuz I have brown ones and I have black
ones but these ones are like a cool like
gray color Hannah you're totally
listening to every word I'm saying oh my
god this is so weird
company than my arm like why because I
know maybe yeah Hannah's right down
there so she can hear everything I'm
saying and I'm actually my sister's loft
right now so that's why I change my
where I am and like all my videos and
look at theirs like if you know like
holiday lighting no maybe they can see
your shadow on the wall or something
I'm like why high up here OPP you know
no that's Hannah she says hi oh my god
oh my god now we're tilted look at that
god she's just screws everything up okay
I was kidding um oh that brings me to my
next thing on my like Christmas thing is
a tripod I don't know if you guys have
noticed but in on my videos I've never
had a tripod just because I was like oh
look I don't need one are not a big deal
but they really are because um that I
can film like way more places like way
easier because now I just like stack
stuff up or like right now it's on it's
on my sister's bed in her loft so yeah
and I'm just by her railing with all the
holiday Christmas lights
sorry I'm getting distracted I'm always
distracted um okay the next thing is
nail polishes and Lucy and me Lucy and I
have a distinct like a list of nail
polishes we want and we actually want to
get them all off of this one website
it's called nail supplies us and they
have a bunch of nail polishes like OPI
Essie and China Glaze oh my god I'm like
sick do you hear my voice I sound
disgusting but and they're all they're
cheaper than that usually would be so I
think su ones are like $5.00 China Glaze
ones are like three and OPI ones are
like six something or like seven so yeah
so I'm gonna have like or like really
good and oh my gosh this video is so on
I'm like rambling on I just gotta say it
and like get it all out okay the next
thing is like a PJ set like a matching
tops and bottoms because I usually just
wear like a t-shirt and shorts really
cute pants and but even
I've had like matching sets in the past
I don't really typically wear them
because I just never end up doing
wearing them but um yeah I don't like
really fuzzy ones for the winter and
then so I have makeup then I was out
makeup and I think I've done some
specific stuff I wanted to Mac
eyeshadows and a the marelize skin
finish in soft and gentle for like a
highlight those really sparkly and then
I wanted I wanted the perfume well I
wanted that support they have these two
samplers that you can like they give you
a bunch more fumes and then you have a
certificate ticket a perfume that was in
there for free like a full sized one and
so I want the Dior Addict to life one
because that's my like favorite selling
perfume I don't even have it I had like
a sample once and I fell in love with it
and then the light blue by Dolce &amp;amp;
Gabbana my Hanna actually wears it all
the time and I love it so much like she
has it and then I really want the
Tiffany heart necklace it's just silver
and it's like a heart and it says please
return to Tiffany company or something I
don't know it's like the original one
and I know a lot of people my school
actually have like the really little one
like it's tiny my friend Kathleen if
you're watching this you have it and I
love it and I think it's like so cute
but yeah a lot of people have that
London like the medium sized one but I
was a large one like it's not like huge
like are it's like it's still pretty
little and you'd probably like that big
or like that big but it's not like
babies honey like the small one um so
yeah I want that one but I honestly
don't even think that I'm gonna be
getting that because like Tiffany
necklaces are expensive and yeah that
doesn't really need to happen it's just
something that's on my list and then I
have link chocolates because those are
like my favorite kinds of candy and um
but I wrote down a bunch of stuff like
on my phone like on the notes but I
actually wrote out a list that I gave to
my parents and like I think I wrote like
a Nalgene water bottle because on my
water bottles get melted in the
dishwasher because my family
melt them awesome and then like maybe
like a few other things here and there
but yeah I will be having a Christmas
haul so you can see like everything I
got and then this is just like a wish
list of stuff that I want and yeah I
didn't even mention begin this video
sorry I look like gross oh it keeps like
after school and I want to make up just
like worn off and I actually kind of
disgusting and I'm wearing like a hoodie
today this is gonna be in an outfit of
the week um oh my gosh this videos so on
I'm really sorry I'm probably pouring
all of you um and oh I came up with this
idea tell me what you would think I just
thought this would be the coolest video
ever if I did like a Christmas routine
because I've never done like a morning
routine or something but I was thinking
a Christmas routine I could like tape
from that tape you know like film myself
like getting up like Christmas Eve like
what I do Christmas Eve day during the
day of Christmas Eve and what would you
to get ready for Christmas and my
cookies in like and then like I can
maybe take like a little bit of like
opening presents and just like make it
all cool and edited and just like kind
of like a routine of like Christmas
because I thought that would just be
such a cool video to like film and to
watch so tell me what you think um like
this video if you want like a Christmas
routine video and if you want a
Christmas haul cuz I was planning on
doing one of those and sorry this is so
