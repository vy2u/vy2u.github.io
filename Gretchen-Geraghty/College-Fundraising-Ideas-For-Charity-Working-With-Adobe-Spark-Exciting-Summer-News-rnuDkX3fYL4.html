sleep for like a minute so it's like 8
a.m. right now and we have a big day
planned I'm so excited to tell you guys
what we're doing today so I just tried
calling Lucy and she's not answering my
calls right now I think she's just like
busy getting ready for the day but I'm
just gonna leave her a voice message
really quick I don't know if you guys
know that I do that I don't think you
would know I don't think I really talked
about it but I always have my friends
voice messages I think it's like really
fun and just I don't know like easier
than texting yeah okay I know you're not
answer my calls because you're probably
too busy and getting ready right now but
I'm gonna meet you in the lobby in like
25 minutes half an hour and then we're
gonna go meet up with Arlen and Jackson
and we're gonna spread all the posters
I'm about to print out I'm gonna print
about and then I'll meet you um and yeah
I think I already sent you the pictures
of like the graphics I made on Adobe
spark and then I'll just print them
we'll spread them around hand them out
to people so I think that's the plan
film a bit so yeah so pretty much the
plan for the day you could kind of tell
by what I just told Lucy is we're gonna
go meet up with Arlen and Jackson and
like I said and we're gonna go I think
we're gonna meet actually a pavement um
they won't like eat breakfast it's like
too early for me to be hungry so I don't
know if I could even eat right now but
they're gonna eat and then we're gonna
hand out these flyers that I made and I
like made the graphics for them
literally like last night I'll show you
guys everything like how I did it
because I was just playing around with
it and basically Adobe spark is like
this kind of new platform like app that
they have and you can use it on your
computer you can use on your phone I'll
show you way more in depth but literally
it's so fun to like play with and it's
called like spark post the one for like
photos and like graphics and yeah I'll
get into that later but basically I just
use that to help promote a fundraiser
that we're having and it's tomorrow
actually Thursday March 29th so it's
kind of like last-minute but honestly
like everything epi you hear is like
pretty last-minute like it'll be so easy
to just get out the word today so that
people know to go to tee Anthony's
tomorrow it's like a pizza restaurant
that we have here on campus in between 4
and 7 and basically they
fundraise money for childhood cancer
research they donate money and give
money to families with kids effects my
childhood cancer and I just think it's
so important and every single time I
talked to a girl Carly that works at the
people on foundation I literally cry
whenever she tells me stories I always
cry everyone does there's not like a dry
eye in the room and she talks about it
because obviously it's just so like
heart wrenching childhood cancer so
that's why I think it's so important to
fundraise money for it and I mean
there's all sorts of charities that are
obviously so worth fundraising for so
now I'm just gonna go into the app and
show you exactly what you're working
with so what I love it so much about
Adobe spark here I'll just turn this
around and talk to you guys since I'm
screen recording what I love so much
about it is like all of the different
templates that they have because it's
just really nice for like inspiration
obviously you can see there's like
seasonal collages different like
featured wines lifestyle business school
travel food crafts like so many so I
just love having that as a starting
point and I think the one that I started
with for our little fundraiser was it
food I just looked through like
literally all of them so then I landed
on here we go
I found the template I started with it
was hard for me to find it because I
changed it's so much for me to start
with so I started with this taco at
Tuesday one and I did like remix and
then obviously see here you can add text
photo logo you can change the design of
it here wait if I change the design see
it'll look completely different I love
who this one is so pretty I love those
um fonts and then you just click Save
palette you can change like the color
scheme of it done whoo I like that one
oh and then this is probably one of my
favorite things as well is how easy it
is just which like the type form
template of it whatever it may be so you
can change it so easily like there's an
Instagram post Instagram landscape if
you want it to be like a Facebook header
that would be that Twitter
Pinterest see like this is just so easy
to have like one theme of like a
fundraiser for example that you're
getting the word out about and you can
like post it on all different forums
that'll be a YouTube thumbnail Facebook
ad Instagram story ooh I phone that's
what the iPhone sighs Kendall here I'm
like really impressed by this okay and
then there's a different effect you can
do like fades and such like that okay
but now I'm gonna show you my post here
we go oh here it is okay so this is the
one that I made and this is what I'm
gonna be printing out it just says
Thursday March 29 47 p.m. that's the
fundraiser - Anthony's fundraiser for
titled cans Childhood Cancer Research
and I just wrote also you can present
the flyer I mentioned our cause to
participate and then I wrote down at the
bottom it's with the B+ foundation oh I
just hear when I made this before it was
actually centered but I was just moving
it around and then I just grabbed the
little be positive foundation logo
choose a challenge logo and then bu logo
up there and I just added those in there
because I thought that it looked really
nice so obviously you can see if I'm
like what I started with this changed a
bunch and the first thing I did is I
went in and I just like change the words
obviously that was super simple and then
I clicked that little thing and then I
could change the font you can change it
yep we can do the shape there's like so
many different things you can do guys
then then what I do
oh then I move down here change the font
to that and then I want to show you out
this picture back here about I did a
little effect on it but to actually
change the picture itself oh I just
click that little logo up there you can
do all these different options they give
you a solid color solid color pattern
photo library camera Adobe stock photos
free photos Lightroom Creative Cloud so
it literally is like so integrated with
everything that we're already used to
what else oh this white down here I
could change it to like any color I
wanted but I just made it white because
I thought that was the best-looking
obviously I chose like a picture of
pizza I actually went in and I used
search free photos and then there you
can still see I just said pizza and I
thought it was really nice to have all
those options Pizza to choose from to
put on my little fundraiser flyer and
then it really didn't take me all too
long it took me a while just because I
was like playing with it so much and
playing with like different options I
could do but once I finally landed on
this I just click share and then I can
share it to Facebook Twitter Instagram
message save image copy link mail more
so I think what I actually did was email
it to myself just because I'm on my
phone and then that way I was able to
print it like for my email here at the
print view so I actually just sent a
bajillion of these to the printers here
for you and then all I have to do is go
put them out and then we're going to be
spreading them around campus today
giving them out to people it's gonna be
really great so yeah overall if you
couldn't tell I'm like so obsessed with
this app Adobe spark um this is actually
the spark post one and then Lucy was
playing around with like the spark video
one and making some like cool fun videos
with her boyfriend actually who lives in
Amsterdam is coming to visit soon but
just like a memory video of like their
fun times together so there's like
literally an endless amount of
possibilities that you can do with it
and I think what I like the most is like
how easy it is to use for like
non-designers like I'm really not that
tech savvy and my friends had actually
been telling me that recently it's so
funny because obviously being here like
in the YouTube space people know so much
about cameras and editing and just tech
in general and I feel like I'm someone
that doesn't so the thought of like an
Adobe app first was kind of like scary
and daunting to me and then once I was
actually using it I was like okay if I
can figure this out anyone can so I
really enjoy like the ease of use I love
that you can switch the forms of
whatever you're making literally in one
click it'll be a facebook header or an
event bright header or an Instagram post
or a flyer like whatever it might be
obviously you can tell I'm like obsessed
with this this is gonna be so fun for
interim stories and just like for me to
use all in the future and I'm so happy I
heard of it so if you guys want to
download Adobe spark I will have it
linked down below and how definitely
recommend it so without further ado I
gotta go print out all these flyers and
me Lucy and Arlen and Jackson and we're
gonna spread the word about our
fundraiser so I sent my flyers for the
printer and look at how cute they came
out guys wow look at that
sorry still hanging up our little fliers
it's our big way
and we ran into Taylor yeah that's
really fine yeah really cool and we were
just in our schools like Student Union
which is like a really good spot it's
like spread the word about things and
now we're gonna head to our College
orson sciences because like that's where
the most students can be enrolled so we
can like hang out there and spread the
word and when we had an information
meeting before for the trip that we're
going on to fundraise money could be
positive foundation we actually had a
bunch of fires and me like thought no
one was gonna see them but then so many
people that came to the meeting we're
like yeah we saw your flyers yeah if you
really do work guys
so we just finished hanging up a bunch
of posters all around our Student Union
and our School of Arts and Sciences and
that's where most people were during the
day so I know I'll have like a good
turnout and a lot of people will come
hi so many people are gonna be seeing
them so yeah and we still have some
extra ones to like spread it unless you
can give like to our friends neighbors
and says we just finished our fundraiser
you know what really well it was super
successful there's so many people here
that we literally we're running around
like crazy just talking to people that
were here meeting some fans I showed up
which was so fun like I'm so happy to
everyone that came out and we were just
so busy like talking everyone that we
literally didn't have a chance to film
it likes to eat pizza and we also didn't
have like everyone else here like
consent to film or whatever so that's
why we just thought we would talk to you
guys afterwards those are some other
Flyers that are Lin printed out - you
can I know I showed you guys like my
version but those are like the ones that
used on the game stream stories - right
so I finally just got some pizza for
ourselves your connectr like mouth but
yeah I'm like super well thank you so
much obese Park for making this like
super simple to be able to help
fundraise for our cause you guys know
we're fundraising for the B+ on Dacian
and like choose a challenge is helping
us do this because they're the company
that helps us partner with you positive
because we're gonna hike Machu Picchu
and all guys like I've explained before
I feel like I just phrased that so weird
or whatever and I just wanted to do a
reader it again how important it is to
donate if you can and just if you can
because obviously it's so important to
me I've done it like 80 times in this
video and I told them before whenever
Carly talk there's gonna dry in the room
you'e cried too
you wouldn't be here Carly talk about
these kids like you're gonna write
everyone but yeah so it's basically very
much why I think it's so important to it
Johnny if you can and fundraise for
charity and I saw that like eighty times
this video but yeah you heard it here
first bad good here we go every all
blogging tax at the same time oh that's
gonna be so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
