Saturday I know right but I hope you
enjoyed my time in Vermont I was really
fun times 5 people to visit and I love
that like me and Hannah can still see
each other so much even though obviously
we go to college like five hours away or
how far away look for I think and yeah
for anyone in high school it's a senior
and I know you're like graduating early
like about to graduate and you probably
just care that you're like not gonna
miss your friends are friends of them
anymore and I'm gonna scared about that
too but just know that like you make
time and your life for people that
matter so when people say that they're
like really really busy all the time
like I know people are busy but I think
when we do is there an extent like you
make time for people you care about
that's just a big thing I've learned
about it I mean time for you you might
want to revalue
really Karen that's like specifically
like boys you know I'm playing ladies
but I'm trying to say getting deep is
that um don't be too worried and you can
make time for people that you care about
and even though meet Hannah go really
far away go to really far away schools
well I guess it's not that far it could
be like across the country it's the only
time it's each other like it's not like
it when out neighbors you know and
she'll probably come in the next week or
two I can't do is it Boston and not me
like move into my apartment go to summer
but anyway yeah thanks for watching as
