videos before I think a long time ago I
put up one of you it was like makeup for
middle school just like denied you your
makeup
yeah this is Mandy my cousin I've been
doing videos a decent stay when I
remember like two summers ago I was in I
filmed with my MacBook whoever remembers
that if any of you were even subscribed
to me then remember we've flown to my
macbook and we put up a video and I like
long brown hair oh man he was in the
brandy local chew at me she was so this
is the cousin Doug I don't know if the
cousin tag is look on around on YouTube
or anything like that but I just looked
up cousin tag on Google and I found
legalistic questions so I don't know if
this is like on you to or whatever but
um if you have any cousins that you're
close with you should definitely do it
so I'm tagging all of you right now to
go and do the cousin tag and you can
just do the questions that we're
answering because we're just gonna pick
some to answer yeah
question one how and when did you meet
oh yeah I can recall when you're really
really little I just remember you being
a tiny little baby like I remember when
you were like fresh out of the womb
she's three years old yeah Mandy's
figures younger than me because I'm 17
now I can't believe I'm 17 but yeah
she's 14
what's your favorite memory together my
dear memory has got to be either Montauk
or Block Island because it was just so
much fun we spent like a week with Mandy
and her family and they have a boat it
I'm talking about I didn't it was so
much fun
mine is that hangout Hope Lake Lodge and
Lucy was in the shower and we took my
dad's iPad everyone around us picture
we've been taking photo shoot since like
day one yeah like more miss Mandy we
like take photos you know that's like
what we do if you take photos you
describe each other in one word I don't
know what's your dream job I think I was
opposed to answered about her and she
supposed to answer
is an orthodontist oh I do want to be an
orthodontist yours is something of
animals you want to be a bed what's your
favorite makeup friend manually doesn't
wear makeup she's like to perfect our
makeup so here's his benefit to change
like money what is something that annoys
you about the other person I didn't
think of something in specific she used
to have this little baby model thing it
went surprises he's still having I whip
it out oh my god is this little bottle
thing called Baba every single night she
would suck on it she wouldn't be like
sucking on her Bob all right and it
would drive me absolutely insane because
we make this like disgusting little
stuffy noise making it fall asleep
houses really fine I do but there's four
beds questioning me and I would always
want the second bed the second my
biggest the second bed and so in
Gretchen's so we'd always fight about it
and also when were with each other for a
long period of time or like the most
alike so we fight wait am i eating each
other that piss me off so much and she
also says cool beans and beet and that
so much tell me how you really feel you
could go anywhere in the world together
where would it be and why but we have
with the lake house together and so we
always go there together and we can't
ignore and talking block island together
but we haven't gone anywhere like really
take enough sleep yeah we haven't gone
like on a tropical excursion like you I
hate when people say excursion I hate it
favorite inside joke brick wall pretty
cool that's just as a really nice thing
you know and dad knows so funny who
takes longer to get ready in the morning
No Mandy is me actually beautiful so she
just rolls out of bed it's like Hello Oh
God
favorite season summer cuz it we got to
film Elsa look books and member really
put all this that planning into it if
and then go for really wrote out all our
outfits we were gonna wear and we were
tan and thinner and prettier what is it
like being cousins with someone who is
obsessed with YouTube it's fun except
when she wanders like other people's
videos are like three oh my gosh but
other than that it's fun and just it go
to the boyfriend
it's also my way back yeah my boyfriend
likes Mandy a little bit more than me so
awkward heels or flats you'd rather wear
flats as the other me too and cuz I'm
like five eight so if I wear heels I'm
taller than pretty much everyone because
that would make me if I wear foreign
shields I'm six feet tall
pants or dresses you know I I you I
would say pants but we love dresses
dresses are fun cuz like you don't know
but now we wear dresses all the time
like we're both wearing a dress right
now favorite animal
she's a puppy dog this is Alvin Justin's
on pillow pet dog his name is actually
Mandy so that's quite acquainted in
if your house is burning down in your
entire family we should be okay
what would you save in wine Mandy would
save her camera and her Mac look you
would say your camera in my bag look
we're pretty silly with it so like
Shelley I would save my memories and my
photo album photo albums comedy whore or
chick flick you so you'd probably watch
like a comedy roast Blackberry or iPhone
what is something weird that you need oh
you eat Oh in my mind you guys eat like
those bagels with um salmon and like
capers capers all that's weird
you eat artichokes and uhm do you guys
have anything matching things we like
buy clothes purposely together that
strawberry scarf that we have strawberry
oh that's car oh gosh and we buy like
bring about the close together cuz you
know he goes that favor through that
phase with your friends where you buy
like matching clothes okay I wonder have
