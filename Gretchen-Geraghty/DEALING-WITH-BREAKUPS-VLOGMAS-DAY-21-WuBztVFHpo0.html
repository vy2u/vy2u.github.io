little morning workout and if you watch
my last vlog musi saw that I've been
going to a basketball game today and I'm
going it Justin I'm gonna update
we're get really quick come back get
ready
ms1 feels really good too
on your butt I know it's weird but it
makes your butt feel a lot better and
then your knot is tight the next day so
I think I'm gonna go look into some a 6
or something or just like talk to people
at maybe dicks or something cuz they'll
know it's better for running but yeah I
know these are like the like for a while
they worked a lot better for running but
when you're running like 11 miles I
think they still aren't really doing a
job because I'm getting shin splints
again and even though I'm running really
slow so everyone we got back from the
gym and I showered and got ready is the
lighting like really bright right now or
what oh my gosh it is no wonder it's
been so bright yeah
someone made it so bright I noticed that
the clips were looking really bright
anyways so I got ready went on to makeup
I fed my face it's funny since I named
my eye makeup I just say like my face
makeup so far and Lucy got his sallies
cutie loo look how yummy they look I got
oranges and herbs it's okay it's looks
so good
Lucy what did you get in yours cow and
strawberries and apples and pears
it looks so almonds and it was something
like literally I wish I got that one but
usually from this place I get um buffalo
chicken with like carrots and stuff it's
just like the buffalo chicken when they
make it in so justin.tv ready at 1:00
and now it's 1:30 any saws and responded
because I bet you he's still sleeping so
I don't really know when we're gonna go
to the basketball game I
like kind of in a rush but it's good
that I'm ready early cuz usually we're
late for things so yeah I'm gonna need
to bite it back alright everyone so I
don't really dress you don't know stop I
just wanted to address something kind of
more serious I'm like a serious know
well a lot of you have been asking about
Lucy in a relationship because I know
Dani has been in our videos our videos
my videos I guess more like our like
you've been doing this a lot which data
star channel no it's mine I 100% share
it with you and your channel everyone
would like that oh my god oh my gosh
it could be Gretchen Lucy Beauty Wow
that's weird
doesn't do anything okay I never even
thought about that but guys on a serious
note we started talking on it and then I
got distracted Lucy and Danny were
dating for over a year and then they
broke up I would say around 3 months ago
like the beginning of September um yeah
we just didn't really discuss it and a
lot of you a lot of you were asking
about it a lot of the comments were like
whereas Danny our Lucy and Daniel dating
like she have a boyfriend still no they
broke up but you know it's okay like
obviously a lot of you know that are in
college and I'm sure you can imagine
that like long-distance relationships
and college are not easy I lucked out in
Justin's only like a half an hour away
from me but it's still hard like not
being at college together and Lucy was
around like three hours away from Danny
so I mean you know I just relationships
change over time and it's okay you learn
and you grow from them and Lucy's happy
she's moving on and yeah it was just
good that you guys you guys needed to
believe that I think wasn't working I
wasn't working out but that's fine she
still has me and she's so cute there's a
million fish in the sea but B I just
wanted to address this because of a lot
of your questions are around that it
meet your do I look so tan right now
yeah I look worried
really though I think it's because I
found a shoe it's this Tarte foundation
and it's literally the shade medium like
it's ugly no it's in the shade medium
tan I'm pretty sure and like against
your this is Lucy's cream Patagonia that
I'm wearing today so they're not dating
and one of you even commented yesterday
on a picture of her and Danny and we're
like oh my god you guys are like couple
goals you're so cute they are not born
but yeah Danny if you're seeing this I
know used to my video sometimes no hard
feelings and yeah we're also gonna be
friends it'll be fine so yeah I think
that's the best way to go about it you
know we live and we learn update we're
about to polish off this bag of pretzel
crisps and also it seems as Justin just
had woken up because it seems as if
Justin had just woken up cuz he just
texted me back
