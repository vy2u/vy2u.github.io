Nike stuff up there they have North East
which is where we always get like our
winter jackets I'm looking for some new
running sneakers I want some Brooks
because how do you say saucony Sosthenes
I have those right now but I've been
wanting to try Brooks uh here they are
because a lot of people like these I
know those are the ones I think I either
want these ones or I want them in black
if they have black I literally can't
wait to have a little baby and get these
for them
how cute guys we need these for our
children they're so cute yes Belgian
bears yeah these are literally like four
bills in there but for kids so kinda
wait what are you doing your fingers oh
just peace I thought it was a good game
sigh okay guys I've been thinking about
making merch and we were thinking
Taylor's like the best character there
is in my vlog so would you guys buy
shirts a Taylor Gang or die tgd oh do i
well I think I might be copyright issue
yeah that's okay we'll think so
Bobby had my evil contact your gamble
don't worry about okay sounds good okay
Eason tennis I know you would buy one
for don't Adam a good severe talking do
[Laughter]
you see and me sky would like what
really he kind of looks like that man
Scott is this you Lucy mood always come
and get our swimsuits what are these
called don't tell me they're like uglies
or something because they have the black
and the way stripes we would always get
them during swim season oh my gosh I
remembered I knew it Jill these remind
me of Jill this is all we would lift
with and lift do they still have these
types of weights they're the best I
would have to shed them down all the way
to like five pounds you did boxing
really I really want to try boxing
really tough whatever loosen me to come
to dictionary little we would plan yeah
Taylor likes getting her medics in while
shopping guess what me and Lucy went to
the first Dick's ever created and Bing
him to New York that's where the first
one was ever made and it's still there
after I got my first pair of gold shoes
so well my parents made me and we'd have
to drive all the way back from the shore
so I'd have to wake up two hours before
8 o'clock tea time drag there and then
drive back in one day guys how cute is
this I wanted to get it with on black in
the middle and gray sleeves but I
couldn't find it so I got green in the
middle and gray sleeves and it's okay so
going on our little Dick's Sporting
Goods adventure and then to Wegmans
after was like so fun going with my
roommates Taylor and Megan because I was
like you know guys let's like get out of
here let's go like do something and it
was just so fun to like it away I
literally haven't been able to go to
Dick's Sporting Goods in so long and
there isn't one like technically right
in Boston but like Medford is literally
so close like they really go my gosh
she's at Medford so far and I'm like
it's actually three point nine miles
like let's all freaking run there cuz
it's like actually so close so we just
super there quick and over back it was
just so fun obviously you could probably
tell from like being there so I want to
see what I got well to see my little
holiday haul oh this is everything I got
I got these sneakers which I know I
showed in this door and I've
I've been wanting these books running
sneakers for so long because I have soft
guinea salsa knees I think from a while
ago they're just getting too old and
there's like all holes look in the back
you know when your sneakers get like
holes everywhere and so much so these
are gonna be perfect for running and
then I got this
Under Armour sweatshirt which looked so
comfy guys and I loved like the white
details I just thought it was like
different and cute I got a medium so
it'd be big and comfy that's like a pro
tip and then this I also got a medium
cuz you want like stuff like this to be
bigger income piece when you have this
North Face thing is so cute I love it
because it looks kind of like a vest but
then it has like fuzzy sleeves what you
need to see the inside guys right as I
tried it on I was like oh my gosh do you
see how fuzzy that is like it's so furry
and warm on the inside so I love
everything I go I know this is pretty
much all like women's stuff but
obviously they have like so much there
they have stuff that you need for like
your dad your mom your brother your
sister yeah uncle like everything so
that's just why I love dicks and I like
grew up going there for like all my
sporting needs when I was in elementary
school middle school high school because
I literally play like every sport you
guys know that I played basketball I
played volleyball I swam and I rode and
also Mia Dix there was literally no line
so that was really great I just got to
check out really quick lady was like
super nice and I believe online there's
also free shipping so that is definitely
a plus if there isn't a dick sporting
goods store near you
quality content over here make my wish
come true
[Laughter]
I really hope you enjoyed our evening
dance party I love my roommate so much
