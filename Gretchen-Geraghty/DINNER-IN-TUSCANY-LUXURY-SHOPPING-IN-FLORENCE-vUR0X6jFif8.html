just doing too much sightseeing without
gelato we just explored a San Gimignano
yeah I'm joining our way back towards
Florence we'll stop at a nice local farm

Italy for bickerson beer possum to get
cold and to wait for like other people
to eat it how good me Maggie on our
third plates of pesto pasta but it's so
good I'm not over it guys we just got
back from dinner look at how tall my bun
it's literally so tall one cotton candy
okay anyways so Maggie you just said
this in her vlog it is really funny the
way she phrased it but we got an
invitation to hang out with your Nicole
kids I don't you rip because they're all
going it to the bar here at the hotel I
know it's probably we haven't been yet
because we yes we don't know what it's
like but um they really calm and we're
like okay we'll go like bond and hang
out with everyone but yeah also look I
don't know if I blog that much at dinner
I think I just showed the pesto pasta
which was the best thing I've ever eaten
it was the best festivals I ever had it
was so good because everything's so
fresh and homemade here and I ain't like
three plates of it and then like
everything else came out like bruschetta
and just prosciutto and what else was
there Maggie there is so much hold on I
know it's I'm deaf I talk oh the cookies
cookies anyone we owe so much stuff but
um yeah but it's getting worse and worse
um oh I hope you can see Maggie's naked
buffet in that mirror I don't know my
good why is someone's always naked when
someone's walking but uh but um okay
yeah
Oh also like I posted a really long
Instagram Oh No
red and no one test mess with my friend
that means you're gonna message me yeah
for everyone I know I've changed and I
really hate when people call me
materialistic cause I feel like you're
so I don't care about that stuff don't
like it then don't watch your videos and
literally all they want is for you to
get bothered by it so okay
I know you're right okay and I know I
feel like this is like a common theme
with my channel like I'll be good and
I'll get a lot of heat and then I'll
like finally address it cuz I think I've
gone so much and then people are like
don't even address the haters and I'm
like okay and then I don't and then it's
like it's just always happens but
whatever just know that like yeah I'm
just just know that I'm just gonna keep
doing me and doing what's making me
happy and live in my life in the best
way I think yeah I think it's gonna be
like me being a good person and whatever
and yeah Maggie told me some that that's
our friends what was I saying
yeah and what Maggie told me and I think
it's so true she told me that like um
who is the girl that she follows see
vanilla
I shall not really know that is I think
I just fall down midstream though
because Maggie like loves her she's like
her favorite um and she was like yeah
she literally was like I'm like not
always politically correct and not
always like whatever but like I'm not
for everyone and I'm like wow I feel it
so important she just realized like
you're not for everyone like I can't
please everyone
so yeah that's gonna be just me forward
a lot I'm not for everyone and if I'm
not for you that's okay and you don't
need to watch um but anyway yeah so
that's all I was trying to get across
but I love you guys so much I really
hope you're enjoying the Italy vlogs we
did do a lot of like shopping today

way too much to show you that and I know
