to be a little DIY spa day for college
because you know I've been so stressed
recently there's finals coming up I just
thought this would be a great time tea
no distress relax normally I would lay
to Kindle to relax but chances are if
you're in college like me you're not
really loud and I've been breaking out
recently I think with all the new makeup
I've been trying out so it makes me feel
best is just hopping in the shower and
thank you so much Pantene for sponsoring
this video I know I've talked about this
in a vlog just how good my shampoo and
conditioner smells it's the Pantene
repair and protect shampoo and
conditioner and guys oh my gosh they
smell so good you guys know I get blonde
highlights in my hair so I really like
using it repairing and like kind of
protecting shampoo conditioner like this
because it just helps my hair be a lot
healthier and a lot stronger to repair
just like the damage that I haven't you
know getting highlights and strong is
beautiful guys something cool I've
noticed too you know in the winter when
it's really dry out and cold my hair
gets really a staticky and like friction
and stuff and I like the shampoo and
conditioner it's been helping a lot with
that and with less friction and tangles
I'm just way more confident with my hair
yeah it's just been great so now I'm
just lathering my hair in the
conditioner and I usually start halfway
down my head and I just work it all the
way through the bottom and then I put it
up in a bun so I can take the rest of my
shower and if you guys are interested I
will have the shampoo and conditioner
link down below so definitely go and
check that out lol if I mascara just
like dripping down my face but now I'm
just using my brother and we're showing
this brush to to recently in a vlog and
you guys know I change up my cleansers
all the time yeah so this is just the
daily cleansing brush head so it has the
ultra soft bristles so that you can use
it everyday and I just like how my skin
feels so clean after it my favorite part
about this brush is that you can use in
the shower I can just leave it in the
shower because they can get wet so that
is just the best thing about it and then
once I get out of the shower my favorite
thing I can do is just put on some comfy
clothes it is thrown at this jumper oh
my gosh my hair smells so good it just
says Hollywoodland
you just have a comfy black leggings and
really just wear whatever you are most
comfortable in because it's just time to
relax so now I'm just gonna using this
face mask that I got recently and it's
really hard writing a piled up for the
winter because like I said it gets so
cold my skin gets a super dry so like
you saw it to remind of fun here's my
twin sister Lucy hey Lucy and while you
let this sit for a couple minutes you
can just engage them some other
distressing activities like one of my
favorite is coloring in this like adult
coloring book I have I didn't even
that I also didn't even show I usually
just coat my body is like body butter
just like my arms and my legs you know
because then you smell really good and
you're hydrated feeling fresh and I'm
just showing this now you can do this at
the beginning of your spa process as
well and I'm just going up to relaxing
music this is just Lucy's at rain
playlist it's fire the song was playing
this video is on there and I just love
it let us off my DIY spot a in college
thank you so much for watching and I'll
see you my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
