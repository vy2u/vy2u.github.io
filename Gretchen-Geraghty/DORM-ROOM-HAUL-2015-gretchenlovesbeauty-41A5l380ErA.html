dorm-room haul as our state or tour will
be coming soon once I actually go to
college and I'm sure a lot of you know
but in case you don't know I'm going to
be a freshman at Boston University in
the fall I'm really excited but I'm also
kind of nervous like yesterday I cried a
little bit some kind of it said to leave
yesterday I went shopping and got a
whole bunch of stuff and I also got this
huge box from dorm it up I can't even
pick it up a little picture of me
holding it right here you can tell it's
literally huge it showed up on my front
doorstep and it's so big but I just
think it's such a good idea dorm it up
it's like this online website you can
get so much dorm stuff but like it ends
up being my cheaper because you get it
all together you can get like batting in
towels and storage and like all that and
if you use this link you can get $10 off
and free shipping on doormen Epps
website so first I'll just show you
everything I got from dormant up and the
first thing I got is this pillow and it
says the good life and actually didn't
even pick this out they just sent this
to me so thank you so much and I think
it's so cute I'm trying to go with like
white maybe cream some grey like maybe
blue will fit in there so I'm trying to
keep it pretty neutral I don't want to
get anything like too crazy for my dorm
room because I want to have it for like
all of my four years and I don't want to
get like sick of it so I really like
this pillow then I just got this white
sheet set which is perfect for college
because it comes in twin XL but they're
basically twin beds but a little bit
longer than normal so you have to make
sure you get twin XL bedding then like I
said I'm trying to go with like gray and
white maybe some other neutral ish
colors I don't even know what I want
really I just kind of went really Neely
and got random stuff but I just got this
a cry little through a blanket that I
can put at the end of my bed and I think
it'll be perfect
then the next thing I got is just is a
black little shower caddy which will be
perfect to bring all my essentials for
when I have to shower and then I got
this little bag and it says welcome to
college and there's like a bag of ramen
noodles in there and some Red Bull and
like a cute little note so I think
that's so cute if you definitely need
that stuff when you're a freshman in
college the next thing I got is just
this silver little mesh trashcan which I
think a lot of people would forget to
get but you actually do need to bring
one of those and the next thing I got
from growing up or just all these towels
I got some big towels for showering
like smaller ones that I think you like
step on you get out of the shower and
then these are just some hand towels all
white I like the white then this is just
like an under bed storage container
which is perfect because in college you
use a lot of like under bed storage to
put your clothes away and just other
stuff that you need and this is like a
cube little white storage thing that you
hang up in your closet that can hold
your shoes like other clothes and then
this is just a gray little hamper that
pops up and you put all your dirty
clothes in and the last thing I got from
garment up is actually this white like
chevron comforter and of course it's
twin XL it's white with just grey like
chevron stripes because like I said love
white and gray sorry it's all like
packed in there so you couldn't really
see it but I'm either going to use that
or I'm going to use I'm actually sitting
on it right now if you can tell I got
this white what's actually more like a
crea Sh white duvet cover from Urban
Outfitters and I pulled out the little
plastic slip that it came in to get see
it's by the brand plumbing bow and it
says duvet cover twin XL I wanted online
on their website and I think it's just
called like the waterfall duvet cover or
something my mind's a full bed but I
just decided to put it on my bed because
I wanted to see how it looked I was too
anxious I opened it up and like put it
on my do bag actually kind of works
among full-size bed it doesn't go over
the side like it should look it's a
little small but I don't know I just
like don't hate look so I actually put
this in my normal mode right now but I
probably had to bring it to college so I
don't know if I'm gonna use this or if I
wanted to use this comforter I think if
it's more like cold in my dorm room I'll
probably use my duvet and I do they
cover because that's like really warm
and it's a little bit warmer and then
I'll use my comforter but we'll see how
it goes I'll probably just bring both
and decide once I get there so like I
said this box is huge look now I can
finally lift it up because it was so big
like let me tell you like look at how
big this puppy is and then yesterday I
just went to like Target and Walmart and
home good so I will show you or anything
I got from there so the first thing I
got from Target is just this sign and I
think it's so cute wait one just says
love you to the moon and back I don't
know I really like the white in the
black how it's like simple looking I
like the different bonds and I know I
will hang that up in mind
room then I saw this belt and I thought
it just looked perfect with the whole
theme that I wanted going and it's like
white and gray kind of knit and the
reason I wanted it is because it's so
soft it feels like a soft little sweater
and I definitely want to get a bunch
more like decorative pillows but they
didn't have much more than that that I
liked and I also want to say that I did
get a bunch of stuff but there's also a
lot of more stuff that I will be
ordering online like I tried to get
Christmas lights but it's not Christmas
time so I'm gonna have to get some of
those online like uh Amazon houses stuff
to get like a tempurpedic mattress
topper because dorm room beds are like
really uncomfortable and yeah I have to
order one of those online because they
really don't have a twin XL ones in
stores anyways the next thing I got from
Target is just this Brita water filter
which I talk to my roommate about by the
way my roommate I met her at orientation
and she actually lives in California so
I'm so excited like how cool is that
like I'm from New York and she's from
California so it'll be definitely cool
to get to know her we decided we wanted
a water filter to put in our little
fridge so I got a Brita water filter the
next thing I got from Target I was
shopping with Justin and he's like
Gretchen you need one of these so I
guess it's by the brand quirky it's like
a divider organizer thing for the
headphones with chargers so give your
like charging stuff on your desk and
like you know like the cords always like
fall on the ground I don't know you can
just like stick them in here and just
like plug your phone in so it's like way
easier it's like weighted it says it
says it keeps the cables on the table so
this is really heavy event bluffing like
put it on my desk and then the last
thing I got from Target is just these
bed stands which are like bed lifts just
put these on like the bottom of your bed
and they rise it up higher so that you
can fit more under bed storage under
your bed because so many people that
I've talked to you said like under bed
storage is a way to go in college like
you can fit so many drawers and stuff
under there and you can have so many
clothes and like food and like other
stuff that you want to store away from
home goods I just got these two signs in
this first one Justin was like you
should not get it up it's ridiculous he
like did not like it but I saw and I
just fell in love and I was you know I
even if I don't bring it to college with
me if it's too weird I will like
literally hang up in my room I think
it's so cute I just love how it's all
glittery like literally all just silver
glitter like it's fabulous it's so
sparkly and I just love it
xoxo I think recently I whenever I talk
people always like xoxo so this just
spoke to me and I think it's like so
fabulous I don't know that's the only
word I can say to describe it I think
it's so adorable
imagine if I have these like hanging up
everywhere like there's are so cute and
I just got another one of those sign
things it says be happy and it's kind of
like a gray color on the back I just I
just think it's really cute I like this
because it'll remind me to stay positive
and be happy and a lot of you I notice a
comment on my videos and you're like I
just like watching your videos cuz you
put me like a positive attitude and
you're so happy and like that makes me
happy that I make you happy so yeah I'm
happy that I got this to be happy and
also from HomeGoods I wanted to get
black belt hangers because I was really
doing the hangers I have in my closet in
there but I knew I wanted more to bring
to college and they actually didn't even
have black they only a navy blue I was
so upset so I have to like order black
ones online or like check back another
time I don't know and then lastly I went
to was Walmart and the first thing I got
was just this calendar thing that I saw
out and it's just a whiteboard
and I thought this would be perfect to
put on like my wall I mean my desk or
something and I can just write out like
my classes or important things I need to
remember I can write out like YouTube
filming schedules and then I just got
these two like power strips because
everyone I talked to you said they're
really handy dandy in college and then
you can plug in a bunch of things
instead of just one thing so I got two
of these because one I will get to Lucy
sometimes I got to of just because our
new Lucy would need them too so that she
wouldn't have to get them herself when
she went shopping so I actually got two
of these Brita water filters so I could
give one to Lucy another thing I got two
or these two mesh laundry bags because
you can bring like dirty clothes or
clean clothes in them also if you have
like delicate things you need to wash I
know you can wash them like in the mesh
bag so it keeps them at sea but honestly
sense vu is only like three hours from
my house I'm hoping to like not have to
do laundry often and just like come home
and all my laundry gets dirty and then I
can just do it at home for free
so maybe I'll just do that and Nevermore
I just saw these command hooks and I
knew they would be
handy so I literally just grabbed like
all the ones they had like six packages
they're just the small little hooks and
I was thinking these would be good to
either hang up like Christmas lights
with pictures on the wall or like you
could put your keys here and then I can
give someone - Lucy - peace if you're
wondering Lucy and I aren't rooming
together like I mentioned my remains
from California we just decided would be
good to not room together freshman year
so that we could branch out and like
meet new friends since we are going to
the same College I've been kind of
nervous about it recently I was like
Lucy why aren't we rooming together like
I'm breaking out it'll be alright I'll
still make friends yeah and then these
are actually are my dorm room I just
pick them up cuz it's just a trigger
Gumm because I wanted that and I like
that flavor and then these are the
little strawberry car freshener thing so
I can put that in the car these are the
best smelling ones by the way and the
last things I got from Walmart goldfish
I think I'll probably just eat these
right now I don't I don't know I just
got kind of distracted you know if you
see somebody I mean you're like I want
that I guess if I don't eat them now I
could bring used to college they
probably would be a good college snack
but probably those before I go so you
guys still only July and I leave August
29th by the way then I just got these
wooden clothespins because my idea is
you've probably seen it all over like
Pinterest and Tumblr and Instagram and
Twitter and whatever but people in their
dorm rooms and in their normal rooms
always have like Christmas lights strung
across their walls and then they hang up
pictures with like clothespin I honestly
think it's just like the cutest idea
ever so I'm going to do that on my wall
definitely so I got a hundred
clothespins and I probably won't need a
hundred off Holi give Lizzie some if she
wants to do the same thing whoa there's
glitter on me from that glittery xoxo
sign oh sorry looking like sprinkle
glitter all over my dorm room and then
this I just pulled out to show you when
I was at my orientation a few weeks ago
I got this Boston University sweatshirt
and it's just this navy blue like corner
zip and it says Boston University so I
thought I would conclude my dorm hall
with this so yeah that is everything
that I got so far for my dorm room I
like I said I'm going to order bunch
stuff online and I definitely will do a
dorm room tour once I get there if that
is okay with my roommate I still have to
tell her room my youtube channel so I
don't know how that's gonna go over it
might feel a little weird but I'm hoping
that she'll like let me film videos and
like be okay with it before I'd love on
way too long I hope this video is too
long I hope it interest you in some sort
of way if you're going to be a college
freshman maybe I helped you out a little
bit I talked to a lot of my friends that
were like older and just asked them what
I needed and they said a lot of that
stuff so that was my dorm hall thank you
so much for watching and I will see you
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
