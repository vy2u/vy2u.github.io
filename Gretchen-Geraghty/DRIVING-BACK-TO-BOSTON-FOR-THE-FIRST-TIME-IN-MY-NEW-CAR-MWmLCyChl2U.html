time to vlog since we're standstill
traffic like legit bumper-to-bumper but
you know that's okay oh yeah my card is
this thing right like shuts like when
you stop it like shuts down the engine
then you start again they're like starts
back up so it's like a different feeling
to get used to you okay I'm gonna go
since we're like crawling slowly now and
I'm never going to vlog and drive ever
unless I have like a car mount or
something because well I remember when I
first did vlog and I felt like vlog and
drive because I didn't know it was bad
but people are like obviously you're
like me people like put it up on there
babe you look here someone's always oh
look at that like one day I could get a
corner but yeah this is better than
using a hand doing that because I'm just
like talking to them talking you know
we're gonna go this speed to Boston
we'll get there by next week pitches
later gosh golly gee whiz we're going
crazy we want snacks so bad we're stuck
on a bridge and it's bouncing snack with
some uses for those little like pizza

about to start playing like car song
games or something but I'm between gums
that I don't eat my are more so hungry I
never knew there was a friendly music
drive-thru i might look at actually food
places on my phone right now and so we
could find like a different place I
forgot what I was just saying did I say
I think we're like right by Abby right
now I'm gonna track her and see if or
anyone here - cuz we're in like western
US but we need to get to like Eastern
that's we're literally only halfway and
we've been driving for like two hours
and 15 minutes which is usually good see

got we got ya they're not in everyone
freaked out but mmm we just got chicken
and french fries okay so we're gonna
starve invite the friendlies drive
through that friendly Drive wait you're
so smart I'm sad come to me cuz I go I'm
a half an hour away oh thank you thank

at Tufts now because we're gonna scoop
Erin go to his house get what we need to
do and then go back to Boston University
which Hannah I'm not kidding you when
I'm not from bu to Tufts it has taken 45
minutes in 50 minutes but with like no
traffic it would take like maybe 20
but low-key we're far wait somewhere
around here when we're up more you can
see the Prudential in the distance and
you're gonna be like oh my god we're
legit far from Boston but yeah I'm
trying to like stretch my legs right now
