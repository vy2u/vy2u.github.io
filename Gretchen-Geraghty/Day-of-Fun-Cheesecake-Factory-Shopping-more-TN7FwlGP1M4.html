today because Justin I have a pretty fun
day planned out he's actually coming to
pick me up right now he texts me at 20
minutes ago that he's on his way so he
should be here any minute and by the way
that's actually how far we're going to
be away from each other when we're in
college so it's not gonna be too
different other than the fact that we'll
go to different schools and it probably
will still be harder to see each other
just because we'll be at different
schools but we'll only be like 20 to 25
minutes away so that's really good
anyways we are first going to lunch and
then later we're going to the mall
because we have stuff to get graduation
presents and we just like going to the
mall like yesterday I was like what do
you have planned for tomorrow and he was
like let's go to the mall and I was like
why and he was like cuz he left the mall
and I was like oh you know me so well oh
well so I just painted my nails in candy
apple we're gonna go shopping later at
the mall and then we're gonna go to
Cheesecake Factory for dinner which I'm
so excited for because he told me for a
while that you would take me because
that's literally my favorite restaurant

dinner to get Cheesecake Factory because

Justin opened the door for me when we
got out of the car and I wish I got it
because it would have been really cute
but you're always getting it how is it

symmetric and then it came with cookie
dough and caramel or butterscotch or
something come out and I put priorities
in there too

lot of it so that's exciting
like this everybody

ended up giving the aqua blueish green
short sleeve shirt because I really
liked it's like the creation mint color
