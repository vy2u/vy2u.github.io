today has been really weird if you guys
don't know Lucy and I practice like
every morning for crew from 7:00 tonight
and we have afternoons like every day
except for Thursday and today's Thursday
so I was planning on going dorm room
shopping today with Justin but then I
was like so so tired like last night I
stayed up really really like and
actually to be honest I started freaking
out a little bit because Lucy night
sorry look at my hand I got like the
worst blisters this morning okay sorry a
lot of your in comment like oh that's
disgusting there's nothing I can do
sorry yeah that's so gross okay but I
started freaking out last night because
Lucy and I decided we would get
different roommates freshman year which
is like okay fine
like I totally get that cuz we decided
we wanted to like branch out a little
bit and like make friends so like good
for us because if we remember each other
we probably just hang out with each
other but I started freaking out a
little bit because I'm like big changes
scare me and I was like I need listening
roommate I literally was looking up on
Boston University like roommate requests
change forms like I'm just so scared and
my roommate like don't get me wrong she
seems like a totally nice girl I'm
really excited to run with her I'm just
really scared to not be rooming with
Lucy if that makes sense okay so he's
need a Philly late last night and
practice the morning was really hard for
me because I literally have to like
maybe a little past two I figured at
6:30 for practice so I was like
exhausted when I got home from practice
I just laid her down and like fell
asleep and I probably slept in like
10:00 or 10:30 until 3:00 and the only
reason I woke up at 3:00 was because
Justin called me like 10 times my phone
is vibrating and finally it welcomed you
up and I was like oh my gosh I'm so
sorry so I'm still like gross all I
didn't I got home from practice was like
changing his t-shirt so that I wasn't
all sweaty but I'm still like rose from
practice you know I'm saying so I have
to go shower and get ready and then I
think we're still gonna go dorm shopping
even though it's like past eight o'clock
now it's like late and I'm starving cuz
I didn't eat anything today like I'm so
hungry so I have to figure that out I'm
gonna pass out Fun Pack did you guys
know that I used to pass out all the
time in middle school because I guess I
didn't like even uh food for our fest I
was going so I have to make sure I eat
enough so I'm gonna go shower now
and I thought I would just start today's
vlog here I was gonna start it this
morning but I was like no I'm so tired
but now I'm like totally out of whack
because it's like three o'clock
maybe we'll get food or something okay
and then I know I want to go to like
Target maybe home goods stuff like that
and I'm definitely gonna do a dorm room
my hand sorry I'm if I'm gonna do a dumb
haul maybe you don't or if that's okay
with my roomie and like also - I was
just freaking out cuz I was like you
know blue seen our rooming together we
could have like a joint like room tour
it would be awesome it would be so much
easier to film videos and I'm gonna have
to like tell my roomie about my youtube
channel and like that might be weird I
wonder if she'll even seen it someday
but whatever I don't know I'm scared of
what people are gonna think like I know
I know I have my youtube channel for so
long now and I'm usually okay with that
but like this girl's my roommate she's
me someone that I'm living with and like
I want her to like me so I'm scared
about telling about my youtube channel I
don't really know a good time to do that
sorry this is kind of getting into rant
but anyways my dorm room shop today I'm
really nervous I don't know guys like I
just started thinking about going to
college a lot recently and it scares me
I'm gonna miss my parents so so much
like I'm really close with them and I
don't know if I'm ready to be honest at
least my friend Taylor and loose you're
coming with me so I'll have them
literally right down the hall if I need
them sorry if you see my hand again like
this big one is so gross
and all those other ones along the top
are just like calluses and that's the
one in the middle is kind of like a cow
stew but that one's like a big like
blister sorry sorry sorry oh my gosh I
feel bad a lot of you were probably like
well like I am too okay so I'm finally
ready to go and I don't know I'm talking
hobby already I was just moving kind of
slow so it's almost like four o'clock
now and I just rate my hair I'm wearing

road no yeah I know that was really bad
at me I didn't realize it was like so
bad it cuz I thought I could just like

it kind of got to the eight o'clock
suddenly because we started shopping so
late so we got to start from like Target

I think it's cute just some things that
still I got all the stuff that I'm gonna
show my whole - and I was gonna film it
once I got home but now it's like late
and I'm tired and I cried on my own
because I'm scared to go to God so yeah
she's cried all day why
basically I've been bets which is
basically the best movie ever
I made just as much limitless sorry but
yeah I really love you of it let's go
watch some of this if you have it we've
just been watching that movie and I've
been crying cuz that yeah it just didn't
said you can't see it's black look look
it like you can't even see your face
it's black I know what you do know you
can see more but yeah I made my crop top
with sweatpants so gob would not approve
really
you can't even see me I have to go east
I lay down and stop crying cuz like
moves on everyone
oh I just got home from dropping Justin
off sorry today's vlog was like boring I
thought it'd be more like exciting and
like fun that it was I guess um oh my
gosh sorry this is topic okay look at
one of my hairs now right I was just
looking this picture from when Jess and
I went to Florida last spring break we
go short my hair why's his hair really
does grow sorry
that was way off topic so yeah we just
wouldn't like dorm shopping today and I
thought we could vlog more in the stores
but I was kind of like I was running
around like a chicken with my head cut
off cuz I was like lost and I shouldn't
know what I really needed or wanted and
I was just like wandering around and I
should have had like a better game plan
like I wrote stuff that I wanted but I
wasn't like totally sure honestly I
think I need to go with like my mommy
like I think my mom knows best I don't
know I just got like random stuff but I
just don't like so much money like and
then I was just gonna women like fill my
dorm haul video
but I don't know if I mentioned this
earlier in the vlog or not but I was
like really sad I would like cried the
whole way home because I was just
thinking out of college and then just
and I'm watching movie I just started
crying because I was just thinking on
college I was a cute together Gretchen
it's okay like sorry sorry if I'm like I
doing you're being I'm not just but it's
honestly it is a really big change like
living in a new place with new people
and like a new setting and like new
classes and it's just like a huge change
which it's really hard for me to deal
with and I'm sure it's so hard for like
everyone to deal with and I'm hoping
that like in the fall so built with home
videos all the time for you guys like I
might need a little bit of like
transition time till I take a break and
like settle in before I'm like filming
YouTube videos and like I said enough so
my roommate and everything so I was
gonna a lot of videos tonight but then I
was like Justin come over and hang out
with me cuz I'm sad we just kind of like
hung out and then yeah he just puts me
in a better mood cuz he'll like act like
a goofball or like make me laugh or
whatever and then yeah so he drove back
to his house but then i drove back from
his house cuz it was my car and he's
really good at singing and tomorrow
we're going to the track during the day
i'm
so excited we love the track and he said
he would blog tomorrow so that'll be fun
and he's excited to vlog tomorrow so he
should be like happy any good mood cuz
today he didn't really want to because
he's like we're vlogging tomorrow I
don't want to blog today but I got him
in there a little bit especially like
singing and stuff cuz he loves dancing
and singing in the car so like I said
earlier all my stuff's on the ground
right there I have no motivation or
energy to move it it's like 11:30 and I
have practice at 7:00 morning I have to
get up at 6:30 which is like seven hours
from now so I got a debate I'm gonna
sleepy even though I have a huge like
we're like four hour nap today my sleep
schedules way off now as clearly as you
can tell so I'm just gonna have off to
bed now and I hope you enjoyed somewhat
today a little bit and if any of you or
going off to college in the fall maybe

bit thank you so much for watching and I
