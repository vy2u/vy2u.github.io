such an exciting video for you guys and
I've been wanting to do a make a video
for so long now because I've really been
getting back more into beauty recently
so today is just going to be a little
effortless and get ready with me and I'm
just using some julep kits which I'm so
excited to talk to you guys about and
it's sort of like a first impressions
get ready with me all mixed into one
because as I'm filming it it's actually
my first time using it and I can tell
you right now I'm really really
impressed so the two sets I'm going to
be using are the get glowing set and
Vika lament upset and like I said these
sets are both from julep and they're
going to be available at Ulta and
starting in the beginning of August
jhope is actually coming out with these
at trend in 10 sets and I actually
noticed by just putting them on it
literally took like 10 minutes like not
kidding like usually my makeup takes
forever but this just made it so simple
and it also came with these little cards
like telling me what to do and honestly
I'm really into like beauty makeup but
these always like help me and I'm like
wow that's like so smart and I didn't
even think of to do it like in this
order you know what I'm saying and I use
like a combination of both of these sets
because I liked things about both of
them
okay this Mavi lip is what i'm wearing
right now it's my new favorite lip color
like I'm looking be wearing it everyday
and it's just like a liquid lipstick and
then this is just a cream brown eye
shadow which I'm wearing this is a smoky
plum island which almost looks black so
I wore and I really feel like it's like
bringing out my eyes even more and then
I was this length matters mascara and
this mascara is actually the other one
too so then this is the other one here
is the same mascara this is like a nude
lipstick and this is the cream blush and
this is the cream highlighter so yeah
definitely go check these out from Ulta
i'll have them linked down below and
also i'll have linked down below you
guys can get 20% off the valta
definitely just go check it out in the
description box and what I really like
about to glam it up one is that the
liquid lipstick is matte and I feel like
matte lipsticks are just so good at
staying on like this is gonna stay on
forever and like I just showed you this
is actually cold that it's whipped in
the shade voila
if you want to check it out you want to
see this little effortless look
yeah just keep on watching so I'm
actually starting off just BB cream and
powder already and I did my eyebrows as
well my hair is just natural to go with
the easy look and I'm just talking you
by my ears and the first thing I'm using
is this highlighter from the gate
clothing set and it's actually
this skip the brush cream to powder
blush stick and sheer glow and I'm just
highlighting my cheekbones highlighting
my nose having my forehead my eyes and
I'm just blending that Elaine
and I'm just going in with a skip the
brush screamed a powder blush stick in
it golden guava and I just make funny
little stripes off of my cheeks and then
I'm just blending it in with my fingers
and that blush was from the git clone
ahead and then from the glam it up set
I'm using this eyeliner and it's called
one pencil matte gel long-lasting gel
eye liner in smokey plum and no wonder
it works so well and stay down as well
because I think it's like a cross
between a normal pencil eyeliner and
like a gel eyeliner and since I put it
on pretty and messily I actually did
that on purpose because I like to just
smoke it out and smudge the lines in my
arm and eye with my fingers so it looks
a little smoky and more kind of natural
men from the climate okay I'm just using
the eyeshadow 101 cream to powder
eyeshadow stick in orchid shimmer it's
just like this really pretty brown kind
of rose like more warm toned eyeshadow
and it's just this really good cream
eyeshadow that stays on super long and I
just like to smudge it out with my
fingers and then next up I'm just using
this mascara that is actually in the
climate up kit and the kit glowing kit
and it's just called the link to matters
buildable lengthening mascara in jet
black it's really nice about this too is
I don't even need to use an eyelash
curler
I actually just use my fingers to push
up my lashes as you can see and it works
like literally just as well as an
eyelash curler because this mascaras
look really good at holding shape and
then next up is Joe's flips in Phillips
as I had mentioned in the beginning of
this video I'm just using me it's
whipped matte lip mousse in la la and
this is just from the glam up kit and
I'm super obsessed with this color it is
so pretty
seriously guys I can save her experience
now that it stays on so long and it just
keeps looking really good then I just
wanted to show you an outfit that would
look really put together but very
effortless and I'm just wearing this
tank top that a stripe is from the store
LF you guys might recognize this from a
recent outfit of the week video and
obviously I would normally wear a bra
with it and these jean shorts that are
just from one teaspoon my shoes ever
bhadori Burrage so thank you so much for
watching I'll see my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
