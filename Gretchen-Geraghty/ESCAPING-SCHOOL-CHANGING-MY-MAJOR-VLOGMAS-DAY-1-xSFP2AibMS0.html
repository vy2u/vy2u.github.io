literally can't believe it's vlogmas
already this is so insane I like
couldn't even sleep last night because I
was so excited for vlogmas
to be honest I just kept thinking yeah
how fun it was last year and just be
able to like look back at fun events and
stuff and sorry I'm like literally half
asleep right now it's insanely early but
I'm going to work out real quick and
then after going to bring you along with
some fun things I'm doing today so I'm
gonna shut up now because I don't even
know what I'm saying I'm so tired but
yeah December 1st whoo all bundled up so
I don't praise cuz it's so chilly out by
bu our card use beeping we don't know
why there's so much traffic so everyone
this little nugget okay basically right
now until it's okay Taylor and Lucy and
I we like all luckily don't have class
right now and Taylor has an appointment
we're going to Taylor's appointment with
her so she rented a Zipcar like I'm
probably some of you don't know that is
but it's basically can just like rent
these little cars for the day and Taylor
came in picked Lucy and I up we get in
the car and it keeps beeping and she's
like I don't know why it's beeping and
it had like a little brake light and I
was like it's gotta be the emergency
brake but we couldn't find like find out
where the emergency brake was because in
our cars back home the emergency brake
is like down on the side like by your
feet but in this car it's like right
there I I knew that it could have been
there like I should as well we're like
literally on the highway like in a
tunnel and I like call this a car people
and I was like it's an emergency so you
could like talk to someone and I'm like
yeah it keeps beeping there's like a
brake light like we heard advise to do
she's like you need to pull over the
cars gonna start smoking and we were
like damn and we were like well we're on
the highway there's like no safe spot to
pull over
Street so she had to like get off this
like random exit me it's like pull over
and we somehow ended up at Faneuil Hall
so I was kind of cool and she's like
okay not to hurt you yeah I don't even
know how you were driving with the on
like it must have felt so weird because
it's like a brake asar on while you're
driving but whatever we figured it out
and now we're back on the room to see to
our destination and I just feel really
cool that we're in a car right now
because this is really exciting
you guys will underestimate how fun
being in the car is if you would go to
college in the city but this didn't go
the very beginning like I wanted it to
however all the vlog misses after this
at the very beginning of it I'm going to
do a question of the day I don't know if
you guys remember I tried to do that for
most of my blog misses last year it
basically came for me a ball love you
darling with you and I know you're gonna
like pick some questions for me to ask
so basically I'm an asset question and
you're going to comment it down below
and then this I just decided like
yesterday but I'll pick like my favorite
answer like the most creative or
something and I'll like say it in the
next vlog miss so like you'll get a
little shout out if I like your answer
the best and today's question is what
should my like intro be for I guess like
any video just because I've noticed like
I always say like hey everyone and
that's kind of boring so I think I
should have like an intro like what's up
to you Peter is no I don't like I don't
know but you guys are created as
yeah they're watching me film and I go
what's up guys and I was like wait why'd
I even say that I never do that so yeah
I think is something cool Wow I've been
filming performance I really got to go
and another goal of these vlog misses is
to make them more like concise and so
that I don't have to edit it as much so
that it doesn't take me long to edit so
I can get them up on time because last
year I'd film for like 30 minutes all
day and have to cut it down so I'm going
to try to just film at like good moments
of the day
as much yeah we're gonna have a great
little morning
having fun and not being on campus
because yeah I know we gotta I like most
don't want to go to like our biology
lecture camp commune but I got a guys
this is good advice that I've heard from
upperclassmen the best way to fall
behind is to not go to class so go to
class if you're in college or if you're
going into all go to class just do it
sometimes it's hard sometimes you have
ATMs which are really freaking early but
just just though
you're gonna love this
I hate country makes my ears believe the
reason that's really funny to me is
because when people put music in YouTube
videos people always say like what did
someone says online people always coming
back I don't know why it's just a thing
to say like sandstorm like people always
say sandstorm and it's like really funny
and no it's never sandstorm but people
just always say that because I feel like
this song is like oh he's in a bunch of
videos or something I don't know it's
like a joke oh I forgot to show you guys
my breakfast coconut chocolate chip Clif
Bar and I found these like at the
beginning of the school year so this is
my secret and those he does it to wait
like half before workout and half after
to get perfect balance
use the whole thing yeah what it's good
because sometimes you don't eat too much
of it right before I'm single things
after so if you just eat half before and
after Choctaw community and these are
good because much like the normal
chocolate chip clip bar it's even better
because it's labored like coconut
sleigh-ride 60 something I can't believe
existed we go from in like 17 days I
think wow not today
don't sympathy I feel like my blood
quality the music my camera and I'm so
so like and all that auto focus is on
video like look at this it's gonna focus
on that I got like crazy wild whoa
I'm switching my major everyone Oh
actually want to talk about that later
it's a big topic and this is our new
favorite song right low Sun don't shine
well it's not that new but it's like new
to me
yeah it's jamming oh let's give your
Spotify a shadow even though we just
realized she has like thousands of
followers from you guys you're so
popular Lou her Spotify is Lucy Garrity
I'll write it on the screen so you can
see it right there and she just has
really killer playlists that's where I
get all my music from and I'm I'm in
Spotify which is Gretchen Garrity I
don't think I've ever even told you guys
but I only have like a hundred followers
it's not as cool I basically just copy
her music okay really
yeah I have a good fall playlist which
is pretty sick I made it on my own but
then um then I started my winter
playlist right now only has six songs so
you know going to get lunch I cheesecake
whoa we saw a cheesecake driving into
Taylor's doctor's claiming we really
wanted to go there but it's only 10:30
and we're like starving so you got us so
early so we're going back to the one at
Prudential Center in Boston
yeah I said there's parking there and I
feel like I can like say all this
because Boston's like a huge city so
it's like I mean a bunch of people that
watch my videos are promotion too
maybe I'll swing you guys I've been
meeting a lot of you you're silly it's
super fun we meet anywhere so are we
Taylor couldn't come because she had to
go drop off the car and she didn't want
to be late to buy a lecture but I'm
being bad and staying here even though
I'm still going to try to make it in
time but we're just really hungry and
I'm so happy we're here yes good - what
kind of bread you like the best brown or
white

the wrong tea station
Lucy and I are so dumb we never know
what right T to get on but now we know
it just just takes it'll take time you
know what's like your doubt we'll get to
class
somehow guys Lucy left me behind
Lucy come back so Lucy hold your
Facebook's red and chilli we're actually
going to class we might be a little eat
or lectures however they're very long so
I'm sure we won't miss too much crucial
information mommy and daddy are going to
kill us when they see this book there'd
be like you're wasting your money I'm
just tired and full and really want a
nap but I'd like advisor meetings with
the School of Business in the School of
Communications today and tomorrow can I
just explain that right now like what my
deal is
yeah all right guys so we're waiting for
the B train basically to get back to be
used campus and all these people on this
key right now that just got in are
watching me vlog but it's whatever
our friends are snap attending uh santa
lectures that we're missing going out
for so bad
we actually meant to get there on time
we were just busy eating cheesecake okay
enough with the your snapchat noob so
basically right now my major is biology
i thought i wanted to go to dental
school or like become an orthodontist or
something but then i decided like that
is just not for me
and what made me decide is actually my
meeting with my coach like at the end of
our season he was just like what are you
doing like majoring in biology and I was
like well actually I think I'm switching
the human physical and physiology those
are both really hard majors and I would
have to do like a lot of school and I
already have this like YouTube business
I really should just be like building
off of that and like this is what makes
me so so happy right Lou don't you think
that'll like be like continuing with
YouTube is what will make me ultimately
happy so basically I think I'm going to
go into are there like PR and
advertising or like marketing because
that will kind of help me like build
like off YouTube and like what I already
like in him good at lucey's undecided
and is living the life right now for you
guys that are wondering what her major
is and basically she
like doesn't have to go to that many
classes and just takes like fun intro
classes meanwhile right now like this is
when I coach is like what are you doing
like killing yourself with hard classes
because I'm in my old G and chemistry
right now as well as writing in Spanish
I really like Spanish I think I might
honor in Spanish best aside from the
fact that bio and chem are so hard like
chemistry eight hours a week by itself
in biology six in most four credit
classes are like three or four at BU so
I'm just in class all the time cuz bio
and chem each have three our labs like
it's so hard but I don't talking way too
much but basically I'm like switching my
career path and I'm going to into either
this world communications or the
question School of Business here at BU
so I'm going to be either in like
marketing in the business school or with
PR and advertising and communication
like I said I have advising meetings so
I'll like keep you guys updated on that
because I'm going to be deciding within
the next few days what school and
transferring into and what major I'm
transferring into and looking to you
know I flip switch on my classes I
registered for spring semester and I
might not even get it
oh you look so cute show them loose he
did like the upside our own like areally
over the other day our friend Christiana

back hurt too much
oh yeah guys did you eat I don't even
know if I even told you but I got
injured from rowing my back it's been
really hurting me so I haven't even been
like working out that much I'm not
really allowed to because I have like I
don't were used to injury in my back I
got x-rays the other day
kitty podsnap's out the other day I got
x-rays to see if my ribs had like a
stress fracture luckily they don't I
just have like an overuse injury my back
