be my everyday makeup routine and it's
kind of like a tutorial to I just show
you I get this look so if you're
interested keep on watching I just been
wanting to film this video for so long
like literally I've been doing this
exact makeup look for literally like a
couple months now and I've gotten
questions on it I'm really into just to
my makeup nice and I really like the way
this looks this is just been my like
everyday makeup look when I'm wearing
makeup like I don't wear this every day
sometimes I skip steps and I don't wear
foundation also man is secured down my
voice but anyway and if you guys like
makeup videos can you leave me a comment
down below and just let me know what
videos you guys like to see cuz I just
like filming videos that you guys like
to watch so yeah let's get on it to the
makeup as you can tell I'm wearing this
a kale shirt from Urban Outfitters it's
one my favorites all of it was done
below just like everything on this video
a link down below and I just used my
setup on moisturizer that I use like
every day here is this a benefit stay
flawless primer and a lot of people I
know actually don't like this it's very
thick but I actually like it for that
reason it's almost like a glue stick
that's like Lily's what to put it on
like rubbing it on your face
mine's running really low so I just
kinda like dig it out with my fingers
and rub it all over my face but it makes
your foundation is seriously like fall
and then I was showing you different
foundations that I use I've used like
the L'Oreal one in the dr. jart one but
the L'Oreal one's too dark for me now
and the dr. Darwin is too light so I'm
just using this covergirl three-in-one
one and I really really like it I've
used it for a while and I think it's
really good first came that times to get
oily because my definitely tends to get
oily throughout the day and this helps
keep my skin matte because there's so
many liquid foundations I just can't use
because my face literally looks like a
grease like so this has been really good
and I just rub it in with a flat top
like kabuki brush and I think it's from
the brand
Luxy brushes I just got it at with
Beauty Khan and then I'm just kind of
blending it in more into my skin
with a Beauty Blender and I'm just using
the age rewind concealer today I also
really like the Tarte one that I showed
you but just today I'm using this one I
like to show you guys just the different
products I use because I kind of switch
it up a lot and I really like the really
light under eye look like that I just
think it looks so good like with your
face really bright and look how cute
that little beauty blenders I'm
seriously obsessed it's just so mini and
adorable and I love it so yeah that's
just
Minnie Beautyblender it's supposed to be
why I'm green but mine is like a tan
color just say whose it to like blend in
my concealer every day and like I said I
really just like a really light look and
I think it gives your face like a nice
shape so that's what I do and then I'm
using this bareMinerals concealer with a
sigma concealer brush and pretty much
all of the brushes I use our Sigma
there's some other ones there's like my
blush one is from like Real Techniques
and like that one random like luck see
brush but most of them are from Sigma
and I've always had that linked in the
down bars you can like check that out
and then I'm using this Laura Mercier
translucent powder and I'm attempting to
bake my face guys I'm not a professional
at all like it kind of looks bad and I
don't really know what I'm doing but I
just think that it makes your under eye
concealer like set really nice and then
I'm using this Urban Decay primer potion
and I have a question for you guys
so the Urban Decay primer potion like go
bad because I seriously think I've had
it for four years but anyway I was just
using that to you at prime my eyes and
then I've just been using the urban
decay and Naked basics palette recently
this is just the first one I'm pretty
sure and I just like to keep it pretty
natural with um just like the brown
colors I'm showing you exactly which
colors I'm using and today it actually
turned out way darker than it normally
does because I don't know what I was
doing I was using a weird brush because
I don't normally use like eye you
normally use those two brushes but I
normally like blend it out more and use
like a blendy brush which I'll show you
in a second but I kept using my like
flat shader one so the colors were
coming out so dark so anyways I just
made it work yeah I just normally have
been doing this everyday because I've
been trying to get myself to our
eyeshadow because I didn't feel like so
long but I actually do think it looks
good if I do it okay
and it's not too dark and I just make it
look natural with browns like I said and
then I like to do the light like
highlight underneath the brow and yeah
it's a little wonky today but you know
that's okay it doesn't have to be
perfect guys it's alright and then I'm
just blending in the translucent powder
and yeah now I'm using the Maybelline
better skin powder I don't even know
fizzes out cuz I got this at beautycon
and I swear I haven't like seen it
anywhere maybe it's coming out soon I'm
not really sure but I really like this
powder and it's really good at like
setting my foundation
and it's a little bit darker than the
foundation itself which I like because I
like to look tan and I think it blends
in with the rest of my body because my
arms or my legs stay for detail like
throughout the year and I do everything
in a really weird order is what you will
notice because I just found chopstick
like randomly and then now I'm just
crying my eyelashes I always like to run
my fingers through them I don't know why
I always do that mascara they're gonna
get caught them together funny and those
are some other eyeliners that I like
using a lot like from Tarte and benefit
and Kat Von D but recently I've been
using this Milani one and I don't even
know what it's called but I just like
showed you it's a little shape and like
I said I can find the link to these
products I'm using I'll link them down
below but I just got this at beautycon
la over the summer when I went so yeah I
just thought I would try it out I've
really been liking I've been using it
for like the last month so highly
recommend and the other ones I think I
showed we're more like hot here and
they're more expensive so this one I'm
guessing you can just get at the
drugstore since it's Milani and that's
my eyeliner turned out it came out
pretty well today usually I don't like
it too too thick and I mean that's like
a little thick but I just have troubles
when I try to make it thin and then I'm
using this Tarte mascara oh my gosh I
literally messed up so bad but you know
it's okay you just gotta move forward
that's what q-tips are for I always have
to fix my mascara that gets all over my
face q-tips but it's hard me up eye
shadow some takes up your eye shadow you
know like this struggle is real I've
been using the Tarte mascara first and
then I do my you guys know my favorite
of all time is like the L'Oreal
telescopic carbon blocks and I do that
after this it lol me like attempting to
take it off right now I'm using this
little eyeliner brush from Sigma and the
Augusta's yeah I think it's what it's
called
I'm like brow what's it called I don't
know I'm in the shade soft brown though
and it's like a gel I think Jo I don't
really know but um it works really good
with my eyebrows I filled in one kind of
thick the one yeah that one but like you
know it's okay like
eyebrows our sisters not twins like it
is good so that's what it looks kind of
wonky and don't leave any comments down
below telling you that my eyebrows are
too far apart because I know they're
really far apart and I'm trying to let
them like grow out okay so just be nice
all right
then I'm just using this hoola bronzer
to contour my face hoola it's like the
best contouring bronzer of all time I
will always use hoola I love it
sometimes I use like Laguna if I'm like
a really really pale because Lagoon is a
little bit lighter oh yeah from NARS you
know I want to talk about but yeah
normally my go-to is Kula and then from
this NARS like flush palette i'm just
using the shade orgasm which is like the
best blush of all time it literally
looks so flattering at everyone it's
just so pretty in peachy and I have it
by itself to you but I just used the one
from the palette and then you just saw
me put on my mascara like I said it's a
glorious Copic carbon black and I love a
layering those two mascaras together and
then I just used my Becca highlighter in
an opal on my cheekbones it's such a
good highlighter and then for lips I've
really been doing one of two things I
either use via Kylie Jenner lip kit and
coke okay cuz it's just a really pretty
light pink or I use the urban decay and
they make it lip liner in the shade and
naked that's just what I'm doing it
today I just aligned my lips completely
and then fill them in and then on top of
that I just used this Chanel lip gloss
and everyone shade it in but it's just
like this a sparkly pink one that I just
put on top lightly and that is the
finished look guys so yeah thank you so
much for watching this video this is
just what I do
on a typical day when I like to wear all
this makeup and yeah I'll see you my
