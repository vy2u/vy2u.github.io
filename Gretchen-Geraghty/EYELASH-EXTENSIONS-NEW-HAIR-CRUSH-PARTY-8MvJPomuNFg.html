the second floor and literally you guys
have to see my hair I am so obsessed
I got Kyle come see Kyle if you're blond
especially like blue and I heard you're
not perfect either
so it says
I was like worried cuz like I obviously
was going to like someone new but he did
such an amazing job
and yeah it's like literally exactly
what I needed like roots no more and
there was also like olaplex in the
highlights like in the dye is betting my
hair it's my hair feels softer and like
stronger than ever and like normally
when I get my hair highlighted like it's
always like brittle and so dead after
and like literally I'm so I'm just so
happy to have like normal amazing
hearing it and he also like really
listened to me which was nice like I
didn't get it cut at all because I was
like listen buddy but since I'm in
Boston for so long I literally haven't
been home and like forever like I didn't
get my hair done seems like August so I
was like okay look I need to get it done
like it's driving me nuts I think it's
so perfect but yes when I wasn't saying
he was like oh like maybe going darker
so when they're like you don't want that
blonde and I'm like nobody I wanted that
one and you like really listened and
like it's so fun and it's really like
cool tone in persons like we like to
enjoy it a lot after put some treatments
and like probably like purple stuff
that's what I do at home anyway to keep
it really cool toned and like it's so
like white and cool toned and like I see
at the top which normally are get it
done I feel like it's a little brassy
and I have to like put purple shampoo in
to tone it but this is like perfect it's
like exactly what I needed what I wanted
it to be so good for our crush party
tonight so no come to Kyle me very a
code to code a salon I don't know how to
say it and it's a reasonable to like it
wasn't like way too expensive like I
don't know if you guys remember last
year at some point I went to a salon and
Newbery she barely dyed my hair like
literally barely touched my roots like
it like my words were still there and
what it was like 350 and like it was
nowhere near that so like yeah come here
