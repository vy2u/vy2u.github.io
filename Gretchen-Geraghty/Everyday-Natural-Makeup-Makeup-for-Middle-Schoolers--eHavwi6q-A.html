middle schoolers so right now I'm going
to be doing Andy's makeup and this is
just like a look for middle schoolers
and it's actually what I'm wearing right
now it's just really natural because I
know that's been requested a few times
for the camera girls if you don't know
what kind of makeup you wanna wear to
school it's really natural and light and
yeah it may be Mandy's in seventh grade
so she is at the privet page yeah that's
it so let's get started so Mandy already
has a pretty flawless face she's only 13
so I'm just putting some Maybelline fit
me concealer right under her eyes
because that's my favorite considered
but under my eyes as well and it just
covers up your dark circles and let's
now I'm taking my mac mineralize
skinfinish natural and medium plus with
a big fluffy brush and just putting that
all over her face to control shine and
it just looks really natural and really
nice so yeah you don't need to do all of
this if you don't want to but now I'm
taking NARS bronzer and lacunae with a
small contouring brush and I'm just
bronzing up her face you would
definitely can just pick and choose
steps here and there but now it's
coralista from benefit with an angled
brush and I'm just sweeping that across
your cheeks for a nice glow having your
eyes with Urban Decay primer potion
this is just a nice face to keep her
like natural shadows all day and now I'm
using the Urban Decay Naked basics
palette and I'm using 8 lights even
become skintone color all over her
eyelids and then I'm going to be putting
a light brown in the crease just for
some definition with a small brush and
then a little bit of a darker brown on
the outer corner just for more
definition yeah it looks really nice
natural and I like to Crane with now I'm
pulling some of the darker Brown on the
outer corner underneath of her eyes
because it looks so nice and it all
together now she's putting on some EOS
lip balm just to moisturize your lips
and now I'm curling my eyelashes sorry I
get in the way of the cream sometimes
now I'm flying my favorite mascara ever
it's still lengthening
it's the L'Oreal telescopic mascara and
carbon black and it makes your eyelashes
so long they're ready very long and this
is a nice alternative to eyeliner so it
just really makes your eyes pop now I'm
taking a matte cream Sheen lip gloss and
our Louie nice light pink new color
and that is the finished look you are
ready to go and it looks really natural
a nice
it's just enhancing your features your
eyes look fantastic and she looks so
pretty so thank you so much for watching

elevated does you always pick me up when
