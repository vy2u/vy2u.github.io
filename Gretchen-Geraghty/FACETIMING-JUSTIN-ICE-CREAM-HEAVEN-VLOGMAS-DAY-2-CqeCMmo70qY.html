river heaven stupid to me don't you know
each cloud contains man is from heaven
good morning blog mistake - this is so
weird filming in the dining hall okay -
bye now this is Anna say hi Anna look at
cute Christmas butter turn around so we
can see it yeah how many reindeer are
there - two that's nice
Gretchen how do you feel today about it
being gay - of Wagner more importantly
how's that pineapple
it feels very linear but also feels me
but it's December yep look at all the
people they want to be part of vlogmas -
just a snowman the cheese station is
Lucy and like literally getting on
routine I was so yeah well you win some
you lose some
say hi to the camera information
services and Technology it's very thing
so excited for chem lecture we walk in
in Taylor goes this is the dungeon want
to tell them how sad Cameron is here
like more than half of our lecture hall
was empty every day when it was full in
the beginning because everyone drops
yeah I guess I'm not taking it next
semester those I'm the part of them so
guys I'm done with my classes for today
and I just came back to my room really
quick well I actually had to get Lucy's
a laptop charger I'm bringing to her in
study hall if you want to know how I am
I have my macbook air laptop charger
here with me at BU I use my Mac Book Pro
to edit my YouTube videos and I left
that charger back at home so I've been
having to borrow Lucy's and she got old
man was like I'm gonna use my charger
and I was like sorry oh my gosh I just
realized I wear this vest yesterday -
wow I'm such a loser
if you wonder I haven't been doing
outfit of the weeks as much like I try
and I still will be doing them like as
much as I can so I keep looking up but I
realized yesterday when I was editing
the vlog footage that I keep like
missing the top of my head so anyway I
think of my friend Hanna that was
telling me that her secret is she like
wear athletic clothes when she wants to
be comfortable and now we're real close
because then people think that you are
like going to work out and you look
still like put together but when you
wear like sweatpants like people are
like oh there's like recipients like
when I don't wear nice clothes I don't
like filming my outfit of the weeks so
usually I'm just wearing like I've let
it close all day so I'm wearing some
like little lemons
and like a sweater underneath so yeah
and also another thing I just want to
mention is that I feel kind of
uncomfortable vlogging like on campus
just around so many people around I
don't know what's weird to me I never
usually feel weird vlogging like I
literally will be in the middle of
target be like blah blah blah or like
when I go out in public anywhere I don't
even
mind but I think the fact that it's a
camera is a little different than a
phone so I think that kind of makes me
act a little weird and plus just like I
have all my peers around me I know
that's a weird word but just like all
these people that I go to school with
and like I care about their opinion so I
don't want them to think I'm like really
weird but I mean I guess most people
know I have a youtube channel anyway
like literally everyone knows alright so
today's question of the day is how do
you like your bananas because I've heard
at many different opinions I don't know
this is weird but I like my bananas
really ripe so like this is like not
ripe enough for me like I needed to have
like all the brown spots and everything
because I'm expects wheat and yummy and
a lot of people do not agree with me
like Taylor and Lucy like them like this
like this might even be - I thought they
liked it very just like yellow my friend
Hannah won't only eat them if they're
like kind of green like she likes him
not even ripe but I like them like very
ripe and like brown so yeah
just comment down below how do you like
your bananas I'm curious to know the
consensus because I like them really
sweet and yummy like why wouldn't you
want it like that you know and also I
was thinking for like uploading
scheduling purposes for when I upload my
vlog misses I would put them up at 4:00
p.m. does that sound good to you guys
because then if I have other like normal
videos and I want to put up that day I
can put them up at like 7 or 8 because I
feel like usually I upload my videos
kind of later at night just because then
I can finish editing them during the day
and whatever so yeah what do you guys
think about if I try I try to upload my
vlog misses at 4:00 cuz I can't promise
it'll probably be some days when I
haven't had a day before footage edited
you know what I mean but if I do I'll
try to upload them at like 4:00 because
I think that would just make sense to go
with my other videos that I need to
upload and then something I just really
wanted to address is this comment that I
got that I literally won't started
crying the other day I could not believe
it you guys don't even know I read
literally all of your comments and they
mean so much to me when you guys think
oh she won't see this no I do trust me I
do I see every single comment and one
girl left this comment and I was like oh
my gosh Here I am filming this YouTube
video and I understand so many people
watch my videos and I have like a
certain are subscribers whatever
whatever but I just feel like since I
can't see you guys like it doesn't
really hit me and then they're all just
mean moment so I'm like it just hits me
when I meet people in person I'm like oh
my gosh and I get so excited and I got
this comment
I was like whoa you guys don't even know
so I'm not gonna say her name just in
case she doesn't want me to say her name
in my video but I'll just say the
comment she said Gretchen today I was
feeling pretty worthless and thought my
life had no meaning oh my god so like
and I that makes me so sad that people
would ever feel like that like there's
so much to live for so I told my
boyfriend and he couldn't cheer me up so
he was like go watch scratch and she
always makes you happy and puts you in
the best mood so I just wanted to thank
you you are literally one of my favorite
people and I value you so much thank you
for existing and please continue making
videos oh my gosh guys I couldn't
believe it so I said back I mean it when
I say this is the best comment I've ever
received
I truly cannot thank you so much for
supporting me in my youtube channel and
it makes me so happy that me and my
videos bring you joy you have no idea
how much this means to me I'll keep
making videos as long as you watch them
I love you literally like guys I love
all of you so much that are watching
this right now and like your support
means so much to me and like I wouldn't
be making these videos if I didn't have
your support because life gets rough and
people will always have like mean things
to say to me about my youtube channel I
don't know just sometimes good random
like a new person that I'm talking to or
like a new friend will just kind of
leave like a little comment that's not
so nice or someone will just say
something and it'll kind of hit me like
oh that wasn't very nice and then later
I just keep thinking about it and I'm
like oh god look I really do not like
that they said that about me or you know
everyone deals with that so basically
what I'm just trying to say is thank you
so much for watching my videos and like
supporting me and comments like that
really hit me like I can't believe how
much I impact some of your lives and I
don't want to get to like mushy gushy
but yeah basically I love you guys and
thanks for supporting my channel guys
I'm getting it so stressed right now so
I don't know why I like by accident
yesterday when I was putting together on
my blog news footage from vlogmas day
one I accidentally put it onto my
macbook air instead of my macbook pro
now I'm realizing that MacBook Airs
really do have way less storage and I
like went through and deleted like so
much stuff but it won't let me export
vlogmas day one out of iMovie because I
think just the fact that it's so long
like it's almost 17 minutes long so
vlogmas day one should already be up
right now because it's like 5 o'clock on
December 2nd like I said earlier I want
to start putting up on like 4 o'clock so
it's already likely
it's like stressing me out so I think I
have to like cut more of it out so that
it'll let me export it or something
because I don't know what else to do
I'm really hungry right now so I think
I'm going to get some Greek yogurt I
like this one because it tastes still
like sweet and yummy and it's light and
fit Danone because I like the Chobani
one would that taste like a lot more
better and I'm gonna put some
raspberries in it and I have some
criminal oh yeah
look there's the new very best I got in
my home I didn't have a place for it so
I hung it on her blind
can we just chef Gretchen right here
this vanilla yogurt literally tastes
like melted ice cream so yeah she's
recording or editing that was funny
I got that on video she's just like
spinning around hi mom
yeah Peter pick all right I always call
it Peter Pan it's not Peter Pan we do
have a Peter pit where you live probably
because of me because in Canada they had
they had a pita pit so I always call it
beautiful I always wanted to look like
that girl what's her name Jimmy was yes
Cindy Lou Who I don't know why I want to
look like her when I was younger
I thought she was like really pretty and
she kind looks funny though now that I
know her
there's are things being made
young I had that at the dining hall
today they actually had a really good
pineapple today really I was surprised
you never know it always depends
what was that puppy know I got a chicken
Caesar Peeta focus and it's really yummy
did you get it with bacon no Bo now the
viewers like your hair has this do you
have anything to say to my viewers look
they're twins both in black so nice
Carlito oh there's a February bear in my
foot and it wasn't named it County my
freckles wait what's the big one Frankie
guys this is like heaven
okay well it's right there I already
scouted it out later
I mean I American Dream is so good man
do I want to try one I haven't tried yet
I don't think I've ever had red velvet
and then what is this wine mumbles
I know
but if I have to do myself I'm very yeah
yeah don't worry about me I'm not
embarrassed at all
Biddy oh the dining hall or I'd be way
too embarrassed to come the sound of
happiness oh oh it is edible because at
the other place at City Co it's like
comes out like a raw
we're like ice cream usuals so we know
where to get our ice cream okay also
guys guess what
so I took like all the plastic spoons
they had because I refused to spend more
money on plastic spoons we're gonna end
up today's vlogmas
it's that way oh yeah distaff our
favorite RA ever I think it's nice to go
brush madam this is how you really eat
ice cream with a fork
that's nice puppy more nuts guys this
this carton this pint was literally full
seconds ago I already ate fish food
earlier and that one only in the cupcake
do you'll be exposed and I had a
it's swag miss say hi you're inviting us
