exciting home video for you all and I
just thought it would be a really good
idea to show you like what I actually
buy cuz I think all the time I'm just
showing like closes up
but in this hoping you two are on me
including some fun exciting and new
stuff and let me just warn you in
advance I have so much energy right now
I don't know why I think it's cuz I
slept for like literally so long last
night I'm going SoulCycle really soon so
I'm just AM there looking pumped so this
is gonna be really fun a haul video
first will just show you some shampoo
and conditioner and low today so I just
got a vibrant sexy hair shampoo and
conditioner day it smells so good ladies
and gents go to your store where you
live thanks Molly
they smell like lollipops in starburst I
don't know they smell so good
someone's gonna try this out cuz my hair
smell like candy and this my roommate
last year actually had it and she said
it smelled so good
it's called the Brazilian bum bum cream
which is a really funny name but it
smells super good I just have two little
travel-size one and I don't even know
how to describe how this smells and it
smells like cocoa butter a little bit is
that helps tighten in smooth like no
other fast absorbing body cream so maybe
my butt will be really tight and smooth
from using this I guess looks like a lot
you know I don't know I'm just gonna
shut up so I got this sports bra top
from my gym shark and I actually had the
matching like gym shark leggings this
when I was like a matching little set
and I just wanted to get this sports for
us to go with because something about
matching sets guys look even on days
when your underwear your bra that you're
just like wow it's gonna be a great day
you know so it's gonna be a great day so
it's my sports run my leggings match and
I actually have it and it's like really
pretty red color ideas that I showed
like a while ago are you sure it should
have been some blogs and stuff I was
more like every day when I was damaged
the sky wars movie every day when I
worked out which is gross because I'm
gross so up this one and then I just
bought this one as well it's just like a
dark gray version and I also have
matching buttons to go away so I really
flow matching set
I like granny grace blue blue set and
like
and I just mentioned this in the blog
that I'm filming today but I promise I'm
going to film a gym shark versus blue
linen video soon and just kind of
talking about the differences and
comparing and contrasting them because I
think that would be really helpful for a
lot of people and I know I would want to
see it if I was kind of between Jim
shark and Lululemon and I think there's
pros and cons to both so I want to talk
about that but I think it's like a
really good time to do that because I
used to be like sponsor pretend it was
gonna be their clothes all the time but
now I'm just not doing that anymore so I
actually just bought this top and this
top like with my own money so I feel
like it's good that I'm doing it now but
even before it would have been my 100%
honest opinion because I'm and just like
that and there's really real with you
guys
thank you guys know me in person you
know I'm just like very real and honest
and I don't know I
that's just how I am I'm very like open
so yeah I don't know what I'm saying is
basically I just think it's good time so
now because I've gotten stuff sent to me
from them and I'm also bought in Suffern
I'm so kind of like both sides of it so
I can talk very truthfully and honestly
about the whole experience a trip shark
anyway moving on so two weekends ago
actually visited my cousin at me Andy in
Long Island and she's coming today I'm
so excited
hooray Juliet are coming to visit me
right now I'm staying on my plate
mattress because I'm washing I'm betting
on just a few because I'm just so
excited
company is coming wait guys who does a
veneer this is from we can't let them
know we sit and then and then it goes we
have to make this place look like disney
on ice please comment down below you
know what you do but hear this from
please is Minnie's favorite video of all
time anyway so what I was gonna say so
when everyone was Mandy even go shopping
like something about being with Mandy
just like makes me decide that I can buy
everything like I'm just really in the
mood to shop I mean I shop with her
because I think she likes shopping so
whatever I just buy a lot of things with
her basically he's gonna try sick so we
went to her Outfitters and I got this
really really cute jumpsuit it's just
his black jumpsuit
it's like silky feeling and shorts Lee
it has a collar it ties in a bow and I
wore it for a business presentation the
other day I think it was business casual
I hope it was visit schedule doesn't
business of black dress I haven't read
and I have in white but they're my
favorite dresses ever
so then I was like okay I have to get
the black one as well and just as
t-shirt dress short sleeve from Urban
Outfitters ties middle
little nod like I said is a waiting to
read one art with my favorite so I just
really need my I knew it in black and
I'm this topic just see it on it just
like crosses and ties in the front and I
love that this leaves have a little like
flare out thingamabob er by your wrist
is be out from underlying which I
actually love from Urban Outfitters
because look really really soft stuff
I'm a bunch of the out from under tank
tops also when we were shopping in Long
Island what my favorite store is there I
feel like it's worth of all dimension is
Vanilla Sky and I loved it but it was
Yom Kippur so they were closed we went
to remain Jenna and they've really huge
stuff so I got this white sweater from
Ruby in China it's very look Thanks like
really nice quality material it's from
Olivier shoes is brand just flared out
on the sleeves and I thought it's just
like a cute little detail to please
these jeans I posted a picture like on
Instagram but everybody saying they are
so cute and I'm really happy to be
booking this cute because I'm obsessive
I don't if you can tell they've been
worn like a million times so far and I
just got them they're like over golden
yeah I just want them so much but the
reason they're so cool is because they
have this really cool dark blue detail
on the bottom of the leg right here and
in the bottom it's just like the raw cut
Jean look it's kind of like frayed edges
and I don't have any jeans like that so
I was really excited about these I
thought that it really cool oh and
they're flying monkey by the way and I
have a couple other jeans are flying
monkey and I really like their jeans
just like a brand jeans I think and I
just find them in like different like
boutique tight places I don't think it's
like a store I might even recommend
going a size down in these because I'm
know if you can tell they're kind of big
be like stretch out a little bit and I
was about to get it besides up but then
I was like you know why I like jeans
tonight so I'm gonna size down and
they're like falling off for like 10
time I've worn them without washing them
but when I wash them they'll probably be
thick but yeah they stretch out a little
bit so when you go down okay then this
top oh it's also from Alleviation is
that how I say it I think so okay roll
over it that's why I'm weird about black
clothes because I feel like my blonde
hair gets all over it and I just love
shedding dogs top is so soft it was the
only one left and I was like this is
Center
I need it and it just kind of has a
little crusty time looking thing I
really like to stuff that like ties
right there or has like a little like
detail I don't know
so kind of crosses right there super
cute and the reason I really so soft
when I looked at the tag on the inside
the other day some of it is cashmere
yeah there's a cashmere in here so no
wonder it's so soft I doubt I'll be able
to find links to those things because
it's just around ravine Jedi so it's
just like a boutique but everything that
I can't find one two and below so you
guys can find this one I'm obsessed with
maybe turn it on and then I was like I
don't you that but this is also from
Olivier ships I guess that's like their
brand I don't know I mean now just as a
gray again really a soft sweater and
this is made out of touch me too it
might be so it's soft guys and then the
back is open I also this is what I wear
with those jeans I post my Instagram
it's just all wide open and then I got
this little skort thing this is from
dress forum Los Angeles maybe actually
tried this on too and it's too big on
her she's so teeny and this is a small
but it was literally falling off her so
that won't fit me looking probably too
tight I tried on its perfect and I love
it it's at this beautiful olive green
color and I feel like these or short
things or the big thing probably a
couple of years ago but I've never
helped on the trend or they got them it
looks like a really nice one it's like a
sweet feeling material dang when we
amending it went to brunch in Long
Island we're ready for brunch and we
went to Monday's but like you go see
this on Instagram drinking toxic from
there every weekend of Monday so yeah I
meant to Monday's and then we were
waiting for table until we went next
door to this boutique called town and I
found this really cute black off the
shoulder top and it's just like this
smoosh the top I'm obsessed with the
smart things you guys know I have a
million likes a moment strapless dresses
are off-the-shoulder dresses but anyway
it just like a black smoke the crop tops
long sleeve like flowy sleeves I love
what this sleeve
and yeah I just thought it'd be a really
cute look like jeans I would say
anything really
before I forget I don't know if I ever
show these officially in a home video
I got SoulCycle shoes which are just
really I would recommend if you go to
looks like a lot because it kind of
racks up how much you pay for rental
shoes so I think it's like $3.00 every
class you go or you can just buy the
shoes which are pretty expensive they
are like they're expensive
but if you go and off you gotta save
money and it's worth it so I just got
this whole sagal shoes but when I
recommend by the way so I'm usually an
eight an eight and a half and these are
in a forty one so they learn really
small but whatever size you normally
wear in class like by those because at
first they were really tight because
they weren't like broken in and then the
ones that you write in class like are
broken and everyone wears em so I
remember like the first class I wore as
I'm I was like oh my God my feet are
numb this is horrible like I got you
small the sides but make stretch out
when you have a bunch and now they're
perfect and I'm about to use them and
like did it so yeah
oh and then also before I forget
remember I said this whole video is just
everything I've been buying okay do you
guys remember I had this cardigan from
Urban Outfitters I just think it's like
the most purchased cardigan
it's taupe and amazing and wonderful and
then this summer when I was in an Tucket
I lost it I think I was shopping I like
left it in a store like dressing room so
as literally snows that because they do
sell out of Urban Outfitters anymore but
I'm like this is like the cardigan of my
dreams and I wear actually every day I
found it on the Tosh mark and Poshmark
is just like the best thing ever because
this was like new with tags and just
like chillin on Poshmark it is small
like the exact one I had and then I
could just buy it and it was meant to be
really
but I got this again because I'm never
letting you go I live in where every day
Oh another thing that I just buy that I
just feel like I normally wouldn't show
but it's good to show is I keep getting
gel manicures but I believe me without
damaging my nails and people keep saying
that my blogs and stuff that the you be
like damages your nails I decided that I
want to start painting my nails again
and just like myself and then you like
save money in it whatever is then you
don't have easy on your nails so I got
this top coat that I remember I always
middle school it's called such a beat I
think I just got it from Walmart but I
know that it's a really good taco and I
remember at keeping my nail polish on
for like ever
so yeah I would recommend I haven't used
it yet again I used it like five years
ago
alright that's really important
so guys you guys know what my best
friend happy here at beat you she's
Alfie with me she's actually my cousin
fun bagged and healthy it's funny
because she reminds me so much of my
cousin Mandy's an actual cousin and then
she's my cousin alfy and we like the
same anyway Abby's mom came for a day on
the weekend and we using shopping a
little bit for Ivy's door so we went to
City Target and it was like packed full
of people whose we didn't mind so long
it was like a raptor on the store so
naturally I lost the time to look at
things that were around the line and I
saw this onesie everybody
it says Cooper onesie it was in the kids
section it's like a kid's large but it
fits perfect
I'm obsessed with it it just has like
the red Pooh Bear top and fuzzy yellow
everything and it's just like the best
thing to throw on and wicked out
happiest faces like I'm just obsessed of
it and I literally were just like
chillin it's like the most company thing
ever
and I wore it to the dining hall that
night and I got really embarrassed and
took it off but like I should I just
kept wearing it because it's the coolest
thing ever and everyone's like yeah boo
man
I've actually it's like a like if you
know me realize like oh but I've said
something so yeah
oh it's fun fact after I got it more it
and I found out that many actually has
the same line so yeah
Oh another thing that I actually just
saw so I'm gonna be Barbie for Holi with
my best friend Hannah those TV PM for
home weekend we're gonna be Barbie one
of the nights think about their night
we're gonna be like angels or something
so I just got this Barbie little one
piece from I think it's on Etsy or maybe
Poshmark something like that then stuff
from Toby before I forget this
definitely isn't all of it you guys know
I've got a white lace dress from and I
think it's so beautiful I worked like a
little event thing on a boat and yeah
she's like it's really pretty a white
lace dress from Toby I'll just insert
pictures on him and then I got this
white bodysuit which is so adorable
just times like that has one little
string across can't wait to wear this
and then I got this white simple t-shirt
but I'm really excited because it has a
joker detail at the top so I just
thought it was like really cool
different and I didn't have a white
plane you choke on the top t-shirt like
this but I've been a little down when I
wanted one and then I got this black
Robert which is a little wrinkly comes
back pull it in a little pile to show
and tell video for a while but it's so
beautiful guys I've wanted a black
strapless like fully romper at this
program because Mandy has one and I'm
obsessed with it also from Toby with the
stuff I just showed I know I got a pair
of nude heels there around the picture I
posted in the white dress I'm wearing
those heels so yeah is everything from
Toby there's a very last thing I'll show
you guys when I just went home this past
weekend I went to my needs to indigo and
in this past weekend at home I stopped
into Abercrombie &amp;amp; Fitch with my friend
Julia and I saw this shirt and I was
just like you know what I really like
this and I think I need it and I
literally got it on the floor
yeah I got a large because I wanted to
be like really big and comfy and loose
and I just love the way it fits
so yeah that is everything that I
actually buy because I feel like
sometimes I don't show like poohbear
onesies and like SoulCycle shoes and
shampoo and nail polish but I think that
that's equally as important so yeah
thank you guys so much for watching this
video and I'll see ya next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
