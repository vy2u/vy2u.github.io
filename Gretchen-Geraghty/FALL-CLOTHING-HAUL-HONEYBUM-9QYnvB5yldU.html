exciting comedy for you guys and
everything I'm going to be showing you
is from honey where I'm seriously
obsessed with her clothes like they just
have the cutest stuff and I don't know
how I forgot to mention this because
this is like the most important part but
you can use a code at Gretchen 20 if for
a 20% off of your entire honey bun order
and the first thing I might show you I
guess should just be at the top of that
I'm wearing it right now it's just as
long silly but black and white striped
top any kind of Criss crosses in the
front like this you can wear it like
this way too in the front so that the
criss cross is in the back and the
second thing I got something I'm
actually wearing as well and I just
these jeans are really cute I wonder if
I can show them to you right now yeah
this works so they're just these black
black what these are but they're just
these direct wash ripped jeans that I'm
seriously obsessed with they're so cute
guys look at them just look at them and
then my older if jeans like this I like
grew out of it so these are perfect I
love them so yeah these dark wash ripped
jeans really cute the next thing I'll
show you is just this honey bum jacket
it's like this cream white leather
jacket yeah you get to be cool I like
the zipper details at the bottom as well
I think it'll good pair with so many
outfit so I'm really excited about how
this because I did have like a white
cream leather jacket I would say this is
my close to cream or maybe it's why I
can't really tell honestly I don't know
then I've been I miss dress for so long
guys it's seriously it's so cute I like
freaked out and I got it in the mail the
reason I'm so obsessive it strikes two
which directions if that makes sense so
like they're up and down right there
ever the middle like side to side in the
middle and then I'm up and down at the
top again and they kind of just tie into
a knot right there and you guys know I
have so many those dresses that were
like t-shirt dresses that kind of like
tie in a knot in the middle so this is
just like that kind of ties manat even
the shirt kind of like ties it or not
right there so that's just like muffing
I guess I love the material too it's a
really lightweight and airy then I got
this cream cardigan it's a really good
quality there's really thick and warm
material that I love so it'll keep me
super more and they're really cool but
Boston fall in winter
except for right now for fall it's been
so warming to literally been like 80
degrees I've been wearing like stuff
like this like dresses and shorts and
stuff which is so insane because docked
over it's gonna be cold
real quick so this is going to be
perfect for that then this top I'm so
obsessed with guys it is so cute it's as
black long-sleeve a crop top and see how
it kind of like crosses right there in
the front I love that detail if you guys
have seen my holidays in the past you
know I'm gonna get assessed with
anything smocked I think it's just so
flattering and like hugs you really nice
and tight and is really cute this leaves
like this chiffon flowy material and
then they like hug at the wrist and then
I got this red jumpsuit it just
seriously it's so perfect look at it
it's like glowing it just kind of flows
out on the top like that and then goes
straight down into pants that are also
kind of like flowy and I like that it's
not like skin-tight hugging you know I'm
so happy I got this in so if my sorority
here is Alfea with a bunch of like red
dress apparel been so like this would
give me a broad dress brunch so this is
gonna be perfect and then I saw this
black sweater on honey mom and I was
like yes I will love this like kind of
hurt on the heel it goes up high and I
love like high neckline things I think
they just look like really elegant on
and there I love like the cold shoulder
details I think that's so cute
again it's just like this really it's
fake a nice quality soft sweater that's
gonna be perfect when it's chilly I love
like really basic stuff that has like
little details that makes it different
so like this top for example again like
it's just like a long-sleeved crop top
but then it kind of like twists my
friend so I love bill details look up
and make it really neat and fine and
then we've got this long sleeve mesh
crop top which of you guys know me I
think I posted a million pictures on
Instagram I have a black mesh bodysuit
and it's like my staple go to going out
kind of look so I thought this would be
really fun to switch it up and try out
look at Tan well it's kind of like a tan
blush pink almost so this will be so
cute layered with different bra that's
underneath I think I love wearing mesh
tops just because you can really play
around with what you wear underneath it
I think they're just like so fashionable
and cute house this is so beautiful guys
it's as black long jumps to and it's
seriously gorgeous I love that it kind
of forget I can show you it I love that
I had like a really deep neckline
just think jumpsuits are so classy
looking and I love that it kind of is
like halter at the top it goes up around
your neck I took this really soft
comfortable material so I love this I
know many it's so much wear out of it
since just a plain black jumpsuit and I
think the last thing I'd show you guys
today I just need that black pants I
picked out three singling it as I grow
up and this would make sense I have to
kind of wear this business casual or
even business form or whether it be like
school things or just inventing stuff I
just look appropriate to look nice for a
lot of occasions I don't know so I
thought these black pants would be
perfect if they go kind of high-waisted
then they flare out at the bottom I like
straight leg nicer pants but you didn't
have like Chloe lines honestly would be
really good paired with even more casual
tops like I've been doing that to class
a lot since I'm in the business school
and I kind of try to look nicer most
days because I feel like I'm more
productive me feeling more myself and I
don't know I get that question a lot
and after the weeks of like oh my god
everyone at my school just runs with
these t-shirts and shorts and like
people do wear that f bu but a lot of
people dress up as well and especially I
would say in classrooms so yeah I've
been liking wearing kind of nicer like
trousers and I have with more casual
tops cuz I feel like it really just I
don't know makes it put together and I
put on like a nice pair of flats or
booties or something so I love those and
I love everything else honey bum and
don't forget to check out the link down
below so you can be twinning with me and
yeah I guess that's everything I show
you guys thank you so much watching I'll
