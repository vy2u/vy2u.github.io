clothing haul for you guys and we can't
tell I like lots of my boys last night
was out of concert anyway I just have
been getting a bunch of stuff for all
that I wanted to show you and also put a
lot of thought and like energy into this
video so I really hope you like it
because it's different
my other help videos what I tried to do
is get pieces that would either go
together to make an outfit or get pieces
that I could match in my head job their
clothes that I already had to make an
outfit I thought it would be helpful to
show you guys like outfit ideas in
addition to the haul so I really hope
you enjoy and let's just gonna make
today the first thing I got for outfit
number 1 I tried to make this into like
five outfits I got it's David Yurman
necklace you guys are like where's that
necklace from and yeah I've just been
getting so many questions so it's just
like this clear I think it's like quartz
don't call me I don't think the middle
is like a diamond and then it just has
little diamonds like all around the
outside and I love it and it's been one
of my like everyday wear necklaces and
then I paired it to wrap it one with
this shirt that I just got from Urban
Outfitters and I thought you guys are
really gonna like this I really really
like this it just this Rose a colored
top it's short sleeve and at least up
the front and I don't know what it is
with me and sure it's at least up I just
love shirts that lace up so I think that
looks really good with this skirt that I
got from wrap this is actually on sale
so that's really cool and this is just a
black suede skirt it's like suede on the
outside and my gloves are down the
middle and this looks really good with
this in the David your Medicus and in
these foods that I already have these
but all those three things are new and
these are just the over the knee boots
that I showed in home video not too long
ago they're from Chinese Laundry and I
really like the way it all looks
together and those of you that know me
best know that it's not a glv haul video
without some Lululemon so of course I
did some lemon and then this a package I
didn't make it look a little more sporty
in case you guys are looking for like
athletic wear and this is just the free
to be wild sports bra from the lemon I
already have this in black in orange and
pink and cork anyway I'm just really
obsessed but this is just like this
bubblegum pink color it's so cute and
this is on sale so definitely go check
it out I'm going to talk about in like a
minute or two where you can like find
all this I just got this coral tank top
and because now I have this and like a
bunch of different colors I love this
style tank top because it's super
breathable and just like a Razorback
alright where those two with these new
shorts that I thought they're just piece
of black shorts they're good for like
running just working out
pair them with my white and Nikita row
she runs I've had these for a while but
they're super good or they said next
outfit I have two new things I recently
I just picked up this gold like layered
necklace and this is just Tokyo I've
been wearing this a bunch of actually
wore it in my moving it day following
the term Urban Outfitters and also from
Hermann Outfitters I got this black tank
top that just like buttons up that front
I also have this and weight and Carina
Randeep I just loved it so I had to get
it in black and this I know is on sale
to it so that's really great good to go
with hey I just picked up two things I
already have and one of them is just
this like grayish tan skirt I showed in
Albany recently as well and I love this
it were this Hillard a okay told you
guys I was gonna wear everyday look I'm
going to look so good with the black
tank tops from urban and then she go
with I just grabbed it these black
little booties that I showed him the
haul video recently and these are from a
Chinese Laundry so what I've been
waiting to show you in this whole video
is this app called Rocio and this kind
of inspired the idea of picking out
outfits instead of just specific things
I'm just going to tell you guys flat-out
I'm really really excited to be working
with Jo Bo and I want to be totally
transparent when I'm telling you guys
about like sponsored videos I'm just
like so excited to work with them okay
I'm gonna show you is the Epis so it
just looks like this you open it up and
then here's like your feed I'll just
like explain it really quick so
basically it Romeo is this app and it
kind of seems like wardrobe you know and
you know how when you go on Instagram
you look see people's really cute
clothes and you like wow I wish I have
that but you never know where it's from
that literally drives me crazy like
especially like celebrities that I love
like Kylie and Kendall so basically the
idea of this app which I just think it's
what genius I don't know how someone I
didn't come up with it sooner you share
photos like Instagram but then you tag
like where the clothes are from even
swipe right and click on it and it'll
take you to that website so this is my
profile and I just have like three
outfits already on here and my name is
Jessica retching Garrety my first and
last name and robia and if you click on
this like athletic outfit that I just
showed you it'll show up at the bottom
like all of the different pieces that
I'm wearing in it and you can just click
on like the sports bra you look find it
online and it'll take you to the website
which is so nice so you can find exactly
what I'm wearing and like you have your
own little profile and you can follow
people so it for me I follow six people
the people that I just like loved
looking at their fashion sense I felt
like
li cara delevingne gigi hadid hailey
Baldwin Kendall Jenner and Kylie Jenner
I just love looking at their photos on
their too because you can scroll through
it and you can click through and find
out where like their outfits are from
and also you can simpler just like a
little shortcut is you can just swipe
right and all the clothes will come up
too and like for this outfit I just
showed you can just add it so simple so
you just click Add photo and I'm gonna
click this one okay and then out of my
wardrobe I can choose the items that are
in this photo so I'm just clicking the
skirt the tank top and the necklace next
then here it is and again you can just
swipe right and see where you get all of
it guys now when I have Instagram photos
where I'm wearing an outfit guys can
tell where they're from I'll post them
on Rovio too so whenever you're like
wondering where my clothes are can
literally just go on Trofeo and it'll be
on there and then you can find the links
to the products at two more outfits to
show you in this haul video that I'm
gonna post I'm drove you you guys want
to win any outfit and it's all video new
and in your size all you have to do is
download the app follow me and then
comment on the photo on there which
outfit you want because I'm the five
different photos from all the different
outfits in this haul video and I'm
working together with dromio to pick one
of you guys to win and the links are in
the description box alright moving on in
the next step I have to show you is a
little more casual it is that this black
American Apparel top that I believe I
shouldn't know video recently as well
it's just tight and as a choker which i
think is so cute I just paired it with
these jeans that I have from Abercrombie
Fitch or they're high-waisted and these
have been my go-to recently and I think
they just look really good paired with
this black American Apparel top and yeah
I just paired out with these black
booties from a Chinese Laundry and the
last thing I have to show you that I got
is just as a dress from Urban Outfitters
which is so beautiful I've had my eye on
this for so long it's just as shipped
tank top dress but is marvelous print on
the front I just started with these Tory
Burch sandals so that is everything I
have to show you in this haul video I
really hope you guys liked my idea of
kind of changing it up and trying to
base the new items that I got with
pieces I already have you know and don't
forget to download Rovio and follow me
if you guys want to win one of these
outfits neuen in your size like I said
before my name is your scratching
Garrity and Rovio so you can follow me
on there thank you guys so much for
watching this video and I'll see you my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
