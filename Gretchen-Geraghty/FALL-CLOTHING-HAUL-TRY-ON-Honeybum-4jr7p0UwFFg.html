exciting haul video for you and I just
got a bunch of stuff from honey bomb and
I've seen their stuff for a while on
other people's instagrams my other stuff
was so cute so if you can hear my dog
anymore please eat good and then they
have this seriously the cutest clothes
so that for the dude let's get out of
its way home to forever expansion I got
20% off discount code for you guys so
you can use the code at fetching 20 off
the honeyBun website which I will have a
link down below in the description box
and also approaching 20 down there in
case you forget so the first thing I got
is just this jacket and I was so excited
for this when I saw this on their
website I was like oh my gosh this is
you feel beautiful my mom actually saw
this and thought it was like the cutest
thing ever she should at that look so
like one-of-a-kind yeah then I got this
honey bun set which you'll be able to
see it better on obviously but it's just
this beautiful peachy tan color with the
prettiest pattern I've made so adorable
and I cannot wait to wear it if you
can't - oh well I'll just put your magic
that have just been my thing recently I
think they're so adorable so I got this
red and a 401 and this one is so cute
guys but look at it and also this pants
I think what I like the most about
matching sets is that you can kind of
like break them apart as well and one of
them with different items and they're
usually look so flattering even can make
so many athletes so love this okay guys
hold up come up this is probably my
favorite thing I got if there is one
thing you need from this haul video if
this proper okay get it just get it
could be twins and it's so beautiful
it's like vertical blue and white
stripes and this is not a really dumb
but I've been wanting a vertical stripe
Robert you might actually tried on one
earlier in the summer and then tuck it a
lot of times
rompers or to shorten my torso because I
don't really bomb torso but this one
it's just so cute I love that a tie
neckties indeed so I'll get it classy
looking but also but you know it's
really long it's cuz I got yesterday
so no more yeah but that's why it's just
didn't what a surprise another matching
set I don't know that's really qualify
this one because it's just like a tank
top and pants and it's not like per did
it just like black silk in these pants I
just think are beautiful there was these
jogger style they kind of cinch at the
bottom I please did and I think these
are just so fun and can match with like
literally anything
maybe top to go with it's just as black
silk camisole this is black tank top and
obviously they match like perfect and I
just think with like some sneakers my
hair in a bun you can can really dress
it down or obviously could dress it up
to you look I feel like I could see
people wearing this with like heels and
like looking really shaky now so yeah
it's just really fun and definitely out
of my comfort zone so I recommend this
if you're trying to like expand your
fashion sense then I got this white body
too and I love that it's like off the
shoulder if not leave it kind of like
cinches up the front so I can have to do
a really pretty detail also I've been
wanting a tank top like this for so long
because I've seen people wear this style
a tank top you can probably get in a
bunch of places but I love this one
because it fits me perfectly
it's like a high-neck white rib crop
tank top but it has slow not like tie on
the bottom and I've seen so many people
rocking like this style of tank top so
you know I wanted one and this one is
perfect and it's a really affordable I
think it was like pretty cheap so check
this one out and it's like how cute is
this crossbow
it's so cute so you might actually
recognize it from one of my home because
previously I got a crop top it's just
like this from a view as awful but now
it actually does it fit me I learned the
hard way so a mix of these clothes are
like smalls and mediums because I've
kind of like in-between a small new
medium but on example I got this top in
a medium when I wore it the front just
kept like falling down because it was
too loose around on me and luckily I was
wearing a good baby - underneath of it
so you couldn't see like my boobs but
you just just being able to see that
different my baby because it kept like
drooping forward like that but I didn't
even speak with it so when I got this
one into small bits perfect love it then
I have these two bralette and I've
actually been wanting this style of bra
that for so long
it gives all of these stuff like I've
secretly been wondering for so on and I
just like you know get the room video
because they fit
honey bumpers a lot more affordable then
mother really marks like this drawers
like Free People and stuff so feed for
Less actually they have like ones that
looks just like my Free People
and that's where I initially saw them
but they're always like a little pricey
Rowlett but these are like perfect I
just saw that they're so dainty this
one's the white lace front is a really
soft lace too and then it just has a
simple like line up the back this is
what the black room looks like same
simple line at the back to my friend el
chavo I love you al when we were in
Zanzibar after we climbed up Kilimanjaro
she was wearing this in maroon it was
like just a simple line of the back bro
look it's open back tank top in it which
so cute and that's when I first started
flying it really portable if you've been
wanting this for people one two so check
it out then this top is so cute actually
we've seen tops like this I feel like
this is so unique
also I forget that story for every
little piece I showed you I'm sorry
about that just time to dive in since
excited about you as I have no clothes I
actually tried it on yesterday and I was
like oh my gosh this is going to be my
favorite top in the fall of you and I
snapped I'm my best friend and I was
like how do you this is our new favorite
Ella but what I think is so cool about
it is that it's really structured right
there so it's not going like why I've
been in like show yourself
it looks tiny right now as I'm holding
up right but it stretches so much so it
just looks so good on I actually always
missed this on the rustic but it didn't
sneak away from me glad I found this
little puppy it's just white long-sleeve
and I love how it has these what is the
size obviously Cole I'm going to no fell
asleep let me know leave a comment tell
me move it I don't know but I think
these sleeves are so cool and they just
make me think of like a really classy
girl with her like flowy sleeves I don't
know I think they're really cool I just
when I was younger and my shirts like
this and I thought it was like the
coolest person on earth so then like the
fright like
wraps all the way around the back and
ties in the front so again so they need
so cute throwing some black outfits
we're good djenka in mrs. Rosie off the
shoulder top I think is still cute I
actually have some off-the-shoulder
little rig tops that look like this but
this went so stop if you've been looking
for like a really soft material crop top
gets it it's white dress I thought I
love it's just a simple all white dress
like a tank top dress but in the back
its kind of open in the middle and ties
in a little bow so I think this is so
cute and this will bestow but for when I
have to dress up for a little like
sorority events I've had sometimes we
have to wear white dresses so this will
be perfecto
if you could even dress it down to like
go to class a lot of people have
commented in my outfit of the week's
review they're like wow like I were a
big t-shirt and shorts and sneakers to
class but I don't know what you guys
knew that people dressed up a lot more
especially like being in a business
school I thought people dress up a lot
so I thought this wouldn't be totally
weird to wear I can wear this just dress
it down this is my casual sandals expect
to see this is my up coming out through
the weeks so these two are actually the
same I got a black one and like a rose
nude colored one
you know it's me drew them toward me was
how they have like a plunging neckline
I'm just like really into that and I
think it can look like so good and I
don't have like double D's over here so
it's not my boobs are like flowing out
and then the pinky rose colored one same
thing super cute and I just got this
simple black chain top buttons up the
front it's in a little crowd but not too
crops you can kind of wear it as like a
longer crop top or it could just wear it
with jeans and maybe like this much of
your stomach will show so it's off
together it feels like butter if you
know the braiding on vocals that are
really soft this reminds me that really
like a classic black tank to go it's so
much stuff I don't reckon
it sounds like I mean I was at my new
food store because I'm like tell me guys
to get everything but this is so cool I
mean this is the first thing I saw the
website that I was like oh mama I need
that this is beautiful cold coffee
wrong should be okay how was that I'm
just one of those like multi-layered
dresses in my cousin and he actually has
one that was just like this and he had
so much fun just trying all the
different ways you can put it on you can
like twist the strap in the back or you
can cross them or you can wrap them like
around your stomach and tie it so this
is just so beautiful and I love that you
can wear it so many different ways
because then people want to think that
you have a bunch of different dresses
that look like this when it really it's
only one so you can do it right and then
the very last thing I just you guys from
honey bum you guessed it another
matching set so obviously it's all very
red it just feels like stretchy nice
long and actually love the style at the
top so again it's like high-necked I
really think that our high neck - I
think they just look really cool and
then you can like see your necklace
let's keep it over there or you don't
leave me tonight that's because it was
so nice it's so cute
so yeah that is everything I got my
honey mom you see me around it was
wearing lots of matching sets in case
you forgot you can use a code at
Gretchen 20 for 20 percent off of their
entire website it's making pictures of
you guys are 20 weeks so that's my
favorite thing ever it like makes my day
when I open my Twitter and people tweet
me and they're eating like peanut butter
banana toast or an acai bowl and I'm
thinking of you or like this damn close
I'm like yeah thank you guys so much for
