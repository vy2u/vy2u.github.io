whole body for you guys of a bunch of
stuff I have been buying recently
if you guys don't call me on my
Instagram I definitely go for my
Instagram you can put my Twitter you can
add me on snapchat to just keep up to
date I just love using those platforms
as well to be able to connect with you
guys more personally sorry this is like
weird lighting right now and the sun's
about to go down I'm like on my back
deck so morning you there's a lot of
stuff but yeah and I love everything
that I'm showing in this haul video
linked in below in case you guys are
wondering so the first place we're gonna
start off with is Reformation and I just
got this green jumpsuit which is so
beautiful you can see it better on
obviously I actually tried it on in the
store in red but they are sold out in
the green and I knew I wanted the green
so I ordered it on Joe and if you guys
don't know what Joe it is it's just like
computer never ever obviously since I my
internship with them this summer and if
you don't have it already
simply download it and you can use the
code Gretchen it for about dollars off
you free shipping
I'm all over stores I always say this
but I just want like reiterate to guys
like it's literally like a $5 gift card
and free shipping off of like any sort
that's on their like Urban Outfitters
Reformation forever 21 sephora so happy
shopping then I just got this white
button up top actually got this at the
Reformation in San Francisco I've been
wanting a white button-down shirt for a
while more like a linen like more casual
material so it's actually comfy and not
like really stiff feeling then I got a
package from a sauce today so I actually
haven't even tried on any of these yet I
actually ordered through dough from a
sauce again to like literally so much is
from dough I just love that the first
pair of shoes I got or just used up
black little booties and I have a bunch
of my booties but I wanted ones that
were looking a little bit taller and
like suede and these are perfect and I
love the heel of these I'm actually
wearing shoes that have like a similar
kind of heel to these right now like
they're kind of chunkier so then I got
these red shoes specifically to copy
Tasha I love you Tasha Zoe I totally got
you but she wore these to beautycon day
2 and I'm like oh my gosh they're
beautiful
they still have like the packing in them
cuz like I said I just like work the
DynaVox and you can't tell but like the
ties like tie up around your leg sort of
like the shoes I'm wearing right now
tie up like that Wow I copy a lot of
people and I know I've said that before
and people are like Gretchen like don't
copy other people like have your own
style but I just get so inspired by
other people about what they're wearing
and I think it's really cute and then
that and to be my style but I just kind
of be as solsa and I've never heard this
brand little what are these called like
Camille's I think they're just like
crochet kind of detail and these are
definitely pushing my comfort zone for
style like I don't really have any shoes
like this at all
Tosh and I work with a girl Leah DOE and
she's wearing these one day and I
actually popped him on and some photos
we were taking like wow these are like
comfy and cute and awesome I really
could just flip them right on like flip
flops but there's more put together so I
should get them I've been ordering from
so many places on taupe so then from
Sephora I think these four things are
pretty much it but I've been wanting
this Gucci Guilty black perfume for so
long now since my friends have you love
you happy Abi's like the best perfume
and I always buy the perfumes that she
has because they sound really good but
and they remind me of her when I'm not
with her I know that's so weird
but you guys know I was talking about
like certain scents remind you of like
people in memories new places and
whatever so I just love this I've loved
it for a while and finally I got it from
Sephora onion toast
I don't know if it's like older or
they're like discontinued or something
but I feel like in store I couldn't find
it a lot so yeah definitely smell this
if you haven't already because it smells
so good then if you guys have been
watching me from the beginning my day
one you know I think I want my first
couple YouTube videos I showed this to
Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer from like
the very beginning and it's just always
been one of my favorites
slowly because it smells so good it's
actually such an amazing bronzer too
it's like the perfect bronzer color I
feel like and they last a while so I got
my first one like freshman year of high
school I'm gonna be a junior in college
and my first one it's still going it's
just like hitting the pan a lot so I was
a guy might as well get a new one you
guys know I've been using the Anastasia
brow products I have like the dip brow
I'm gonna get thicker eyebrow pencil but
I liked it this one's so skinny this is
the brow is because it just lets you be
more like precise and I've gotten this
and soft brown a lot and then it's when
I got into
and tote mighty to life but if you like
soft brown is too dark I don't know I
just kind of used both those like here
and there and I think I showed it blog
this summer but I actually cracked my
Becca highlighter which was like the
saddest moment of my life I used to have
to Becca highlighter and opal but then
this one I got in Champagne pop and I
don't know this is like special limited
edition packaging or something but it's
like a different color my other one and
it's just like the perfect I got this
silky pajama set it's just like this
black lace top which is so cute and I
like that I can wear this with like
normal outfits to Alan about it doesn't
only have to be like for pajamas and
then I just got the black matching
bottoms to go with wow do I only have
two things from Urban Outfitters that's
crazy I'm probably forgetting stuff I
totally knew I forgot stuff I actually
got this red little knotted t-shirt
dress I think it's so cute I'm
absolutely obsessed with it so yeah
basically just buy it so we can be clean
I just got this schnapps top and I've
been so into smoke things like you will
see and what I'm about to show you this
one I saw for a while on do it and I
really wanted and then they're like out
of stock in my side I was like dang it
so I just ordered size up and I would
recommend going a size up in like smock
tops anyway because they run a pretty
small generally like everywhere because
I want to size up and it still fits
obviously it's super fun the only weird
thing Tosh and I were talking about
because she got it in the green color is
it kind of like folds over the top a lot
and it doesn't bother me too much but
Tasha said it was like bothering her and
if it bothers you just know that Oh like
obviously the top I'm wearing right now
is knocked also don't I look so weird I
feel so naked because I joined army
David you're my necklaces I took it off
the other day I think when I was working
out and I just don't know where to but
I'll find it so I just got this like
periwinkle blue smock top it's so cute I
went out to lunch today and my waitress
said she loved I got a compliment so Wow
I am totally mind blanking right now but
I'm pretty sure this is from either
bestie or white fox boutique or Selby
Leslie one of those actually got a bunch
of stuff from those online boutiques but
I just don't have time to show it in
this haul because I just want to be
showing you so definitely just check out
my Instagram and I'm posting so many
pictures on there then I just got this
black little small
to top from Urban Outfitters I actually
have it in the pink color I showed it on
in my most recent all videos with Urban
Outfitters but I just got it in the
black color - this jacket brings me so
much joy I've had my eye on like a
jacket this color for so long and then
when the Nordstrom anniversary sale
happened I was like ooh baby now is the
time so I was watching my friend Tasha
here on YouTube I was watching her
Nordstrom anniversary and fall video and
she actually got this jacket I'm a good
gray color and I saw they had it in his
color called spice and I was like oh my
gosh I've been wanting a jacket this
color there's so long so I like hopped
on that like he was like the day the
sales started there was like one jacket
left in my size so I was like oh my gosh
oh my always like getting jackets bigger
so you guys know it snowman is small but
this I got in a medium because I want it
to be like a bigger jacket you know I
don't like jackets that are like really
tight on me so this is like perfect the
medium and I know it's by Blink and icy
and I got it for like a good it
discounts and Sue's on the sale I think
I saw it at Nordstrom if you want to get
it but I'm not sure if it's on sale so
definitely just like check the
description box is linked to see if they
still fit then the one thing I ordered
from Lulu's is so cute you guys probably
recognize this dress from PETA cont'd a
one I got so many compliments on it and
I think it's just really unique wow I
got so much from forever 21 and I feel
get a tribal fighting shot there but
recently I guess they've been killing me
so the first thing I ordered is so funny
there's like me like I always lose phone
chargers and this one we who works that
dough I was like stalking her list and
it's so fun to go on toe and like look
at your friends lists and stock what
they favor didn't and you're like oh I
like that I want that or you can like
get some presents that way anyway so I
was looking through her less because she
was like the best style and that's why I
got those stole sana a sauce little
meals I saw that she had this forever 21
light up USB iPhone charger and I'm like
I need that and it's from forever 21 and
I loved it I just like plugging into my
computer in my room like I'm like that
and my phone's charging I can have like
my Christmas lights on in my room and
it's just like a chill nighttime charger
and it's so fun than these two dresses I
actually ordered as options for me
but I ended up learning with other
things so this one I just got smoked
again light blue like off-the-shoulder
flares out oh it's funny is I actually
got like this same dress in this marine
color but it's from this brand called
altered state and I don't even know if
they have like a store in real life or
it's just online but I just saw that
brand on doe and I saw that they had
basically the same dress but in purple
even though I didn't we do condom so I'm
gonna wear them like all the time to
class whatever I also does this yellow
dress from forever 21 June and a brain
speeding on but still super cute it's
obviously like very summery again
smocked off-the-shoulder droplets are
being surprised
I don't know why that's just fun like my
favorite go to trend recently smoke
things I actually didn't know that it
was maxi when I ordered online I thought
it was like MIDI but it is maxi so know
that as well and these t-shirts actually
came yesterday from forever 21 I ordered
this white top when I was scrolling
through dough basically I just throw
through there all the time sigh how they
said it with your shopping problem I saw
this like ruffled white top and this I
also just saw on the model scrolling
through forever 21 and I'm like this is
like different and cute and I love it
and it just has like darker navy blue
ties at the top and I don't know I just
thought it was like unique and really
cute and then last but not least she was
shark see if you guys don't know I've
been partnered with Jim shark for a
while now because I'm like obsessed with
her workout clothes and I still want to
do a Lululemon versus Jim shark athletic
clothes video just to compare the two to
give you like my thoughts but they're
actually ending there Ambassador Program
which is so sad that I understand like
they're growing like crazy like they
don't need influencers like me to help
them anymore just so you're aware of
that fossil of Doom shark link down
below so you can like signs at these
clothes I just like we'll be working
with him anymore so its first set it's
actually really funny I don't know why
when I was packing for San Francisco I
was there for a week
interning with DOE and I packed one
sports bra I don't know what was going
through my head but I was working out
like every day they're not every day
some consecutive days I tried okay but
definitely more than like three or four
times and I only brought this sports bra
because it's one of my favorite and I
love it but I don't know why I did bring
other ones so I went just so it's like a
like two or three days in a row and I
wore this every day and I was
oh my god Gretchen that's so girl it's
like I can't believe you did that but I
just had like no option so I should just
water SoulCycle sports rock basically I
love this because this is like the only
sports where I've been wearing it's
probably gotten wash like a million
times even though I got it like a couple
of weeks ago it's just like this
beautiful maroon color a nice little
cross a detail on the back and it's
really stretchy so it's like comfortable
because some sports bras aren't
stretching up and I don't like them
because they're not like comfortable
enough and it goes perfectly honest it's
like a matching set with these
high-waisted cropped leggings and I love
these these are like the seamless line
I'm pretty sure so cute together I went
this is a matching set to SoulCycle I
know kind of embarrassing but I think
it's so cute
and I feel really confident am i
comfortable in it so okay they recommend
these you guys show this in a vlog cuz
they let Mandy wear it one day when we
are going on a little run it's just like
this really cute coral kind of muscle
you take cut tank top and it's cropped
so love this I love like high next
things that I'm working out with in
these leggings I've really been a fan of
to you these are just cropped dragon
leggings and they have like some mesh
details along the side in the back i
really don't like cropped like because
this summer my bloomin wonder unders are
always gonna be like one of my staple
leggings if you think Lululemon leggings
are way too overpriced and like crazy
the answer is yes they are like I
totally agree with you but I just got
these from Jim sharp and they're the
dreamy leggings I'm telling you they are
just like the Lululemon wonder unders
they're like kind of I could do for them
but I like the material even more
because it doesn't pill these are like
amazing and I can assure they're like
half the price of the lemon ones so if
you don't want to buy the little lemon
ones because they're made too expensive
which they are and they actually do pale
a lot of mine or like really pale you
but I still like love that if you
they're a little bit more like an
athletic material which I really enjoy
like looking out and obviously so
definitely try these out the dreamy ones
and the very last thing I have to share
with you is this like very muscley it
came kind of aqua turquoise it just says
Jim shark across the top again love that
a tie next and this is just so
comfortable it's like the softest
material ever so yeah I think that is
pretty much everything I have to show
you guys in this haul video if you enjoy
trying to haul videos be sure to give
this video a big thumbs up so I know
that you like them
I'm having so many haul videos coming
because I'm just obsessed with all
videos that's why i like watching so i
assume it so you guys like watching too
