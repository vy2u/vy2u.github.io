favorites video to share with you guys
and I'm really sorry if my voice is kind
of gone and during this video because
the past four days have actually been
recruitment here at BU
I went through a rush tonight it's
actually big night I'm so nervous but I
feel like I'm gonna talk about that more
in another video so back to my February
favorites basically these are just ten
things that I've been loving this month
and I thought I would share them in you
guys you guys aren't subscribed already
don't forget to subscribe down below you
can follow me on my social media as
always and if you like this video be
sure to give it a thumbs up and can you
guys leave me a comment down below if
you even like favorites videos because I
personally really like them but I like
seeing what people are liking at the
moment so my first favorite I feel like
this is kind of weird or I don't know
because I feel like SoulCycle is such a
trendy thing but I honestly love it
SoulCycle is definitely my first
favorite for February just because it's
such an amazing environment to be in I
just love it like it's so addicting
$5,000,000 I literally would go every
morning I actually just went this
morning at 7 a.m. and it was just so
great like yeah I wasn't like jumping
out of bed at 6 a.m. but when you get
there you're so excited and to me it's
not even a workout it's just like a fun
time so that's why it makes working out
for me it's so much fun
I just love it I can't talk enough about
it it's such like an inspiring
environment and it's really really
really motivating like if you done it
before you know what I'm talking about
but if you haven't done it you literally
should try it out I'm linked down below
the page where you guys can go sign up
and like making a cow because it's
pretty simple and I know if it's your
first class you get it for like $20
instead of like 30 my second favorite
for February is actually right back here
he's name is chocolate if you guys don't
follow me on snapchat you really should
and you would have seen it already
because my best friend Taylor actually
got me chocolate for Valentine's Day and
we've been in love ever since he smells
like chocolate guys - any of you have
the Too Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer
because he smells just like that so
thank you so much Taylor for giving me
chocolate I'm literally obsessed it's
still love you - April oh my gosh my
bunny April from Build America smells
like cotton candy I don't know what is
up with me and yummy smelly
cameras my third favorite this month is
actually this teeth whitening kit and I
don't know if you can tell can you see
how I my teeth are now guys I'm like
obsessed with having my teeth like I
just always want white teeth and they
literally have gotten so white this
month from this pop smile kit I'm gonna
tell you a little bit about it so
basically the pop smile ultimate
whitening kit will just come in like a
little box like this and it comes in
this cute little pouch I think its own
of what it says smile you're awesome
this is literally my favorite new makeup
bag but it just comes with these
instructions that are super clear and
easy to figure out and what I really
like about this one is it's such a quick
treatment it's only five days long and
use it twice a day
and it just comes with like a three
whitening gel syringes like this but I
already threw two of them away and this
one's just an empty one that I saved to
show you what it looks like because I
did it already but I just saved all this
I could show you it comes with these a
plastic trays like this but you actually
put them in boiling water and then mold
them to your teeth so these are like
molded into my teeth and then you just
fill the trays with like the whitening
gel it's super easy I've done whitening
kits like this before but this one
literally worked so well so I knew I had
to tell you guys about it and while you
have the trays in your mouth with the
whitening gel on your teeth you just put
this LED light over them and also
another pro of this binding kit that I
really really like is you use it twice a
day but it's only ten minutes each was
super quick like literally I would do in
the morning before I would leave in the
morning because I would have 10 minutes
because it wasn't like a whitening kit
we're gonna have to be on for like half
an hour an hour and then at night ten
minutes like zips right by so super
convenient as well I know it can take
your teeth up to eight shades whiter and
only five days but seriously so amazing
and I actually know that I mentioned it
in the vlog on my blog channel when it
was the Superbowl that night that was
the first night I started using it so my
teeth were definitely less white back
then because now like look at these
puppies guys do you see how light they
are like literally my friends have been
thing like crushing your teeth look so I
and I'm like like I've like gotten all
my suitemates hooked they're like oh my
gosh we're getting pop smiles like look
it it comes with this teeth whitening
pen that you can just use for touch-ups
oh and that's nice
I'm super thankful I get to be working
with pop smile in this videos I truly
use these for five days and I really
loved it like look at my freaking teeth
I will have a link down below so you
guys can check it out if you're
interested and you guys already know my
policy on working with brands and videos
and just how open I am so I don't even
have to say this but like thank you so
much possible for sponsoring this video
because it really loved their brand and
their product and I wouldn't just be
saying that I can find the links to any
of these products I'm talking about or
mentioning in this video I've described
shemagh so it's easier for you guys to
find like this next product that I got
from Amazon I'll link down below it's
called wow butter it says it's just like
peanut butter but better and those of
you that know me know that I'm obsessed
with peanut butter and this actually has
no peanuts in it it's literally just
made out of toasted soy and when I
showed it in a vlog not too long ago
because I'm obsessed with it everyone's
like whoa why are you eating that like
you're not allergic to peanuts but I
actually found out about it because my
best friend Taylor younger brother
Zachary he's allergic to peanuts and so
their family gets whale butter for him
and I tried it once and I was like whoa
this is so good like it tastes like
normal peanut butter but like a little
bit sweeter and like it looks like
peanut butter it's crazy how much it
tastes like peanut butter but it's not
so I've been loving it I put it on like
rice cakes you can put an oatmeal you
can eat it with dates and I just wanted
to would tell you guys about this encase
you haven't heard of it because I know
someone even floral urge to be nuts and
if any of you are allergic to peanuts
you haven't try this I just wanted to
let you know about it I bet and I have
two other jars of Trader Joe's made of
butter I'm afraid and I don't know if
you guys have seen at my favorites
videos before but I like to do like all
different realms of my life in my
favorites video because I think it's the
most interesting like I like to do food
beauty songs so this next thing is a
song and if you guys don't follow Lucy
me on our Spotify so what are you doing
Lucy's just just Lucy Garrity and mine
is just scratching with five ends but
honestly if you're gonna follow one of
us probably because she has the best
playlist I don't even know you could
message people on Spotify but artists
were like reaching out to Lucy on
Spotify I mean like can you please
include our songs like in your playlist
because she's like Spotify famous like
everyone follows your playlist cuz
they're so good I don't really make
playlist that often and when I do
they're not that good because I just
follow with using players so one
playlist that I've been loving has been
killing it and that's actually just on
my Spotify and it's just a really good
like getting ready playlist I listen to
it getting ready this morning and I got
my sweet main was trying to sleep wait I
literally sing the song I'm about to
play for you is it even in that playlist
but I was just listening to it I
remember like a week or two ago and I've
been playing it like on repeat when I'm
like chilling or just doing homework I'm
right I listen to want to play in one
side I was like fall asleep to it cuz
it's just like really chilling awesome
and okay I'm just gonna tell you about
it now so it's called it welcome my son
by radical face and I'm pretty sure it's
like an older song like it probably
isn't anything new but just listen
you've probably heard it before
oh it makes me so happy
I'm like Tom defin can't sing so I just
listen I think I've done yoga should I
song too before so it just has really
good vibes and yeah highly recommend
Gretchen why do you always on forever
and make editing it so hard for yourself
okay my sixth favorite is the first day
beauty ultra Repair Cream and I just got
this massive one I just ordered it
online at Sephora because I've been
using this like little smaller one for
the past month and I just love it so
much and I actually wanted to do a
little comparison a little stand off I
hate my facial moisturizer this is like
so fun for me this is the Cetaphil
moisturizing lotion and I've been using
this for ever as long as I can remember
like years and I used this in the past
but it was never really a staple and
then I've been using it so much recently
and I would say out of the two if this
wins just because this is a little bit
thicker I would use a lotion sometimes
we set a pill but also the cream but the
cream is so thick and it leaves like a
really like oily like a residue on your
skin but this doesn't your skin just
like soaks it right up so I think this
is a really happy medium between at the
Cetaphil moisturizing lotion and cream
my seventh favorite is sweet green and
those of you that know me won't be some
president all because I've been going
there for years and I think no I know I
at least get two I would say two to five
salads from there a week like two is
really on the lower end actually this
past weekend I ate there six times
turning recruitment Widow to lunch and
dinner like every day basically I'm just
obsessed with it can't talk enough about
it and I'm so thankful that I've been
able to work with them I'm actually a
sweet great ambassador now stay tuned
for like fun events I'll have planned in
Boston with them and yeah that's just
like your little sneak preview but
literally I love to green so much oh
such an amazing company they're the best
house in the whole entire world to try
if you have it that's my favorite ever
made this was a fail high eighth
favorite was alternative music on
Spotify but I already talked about
Spotify and showed you my favorite song
recently but I feel like Lucy's music
tastes so my music taste is like
alternative I don't know
don't shoot me for those of you to
actually know about music so yeah that
was a fail I really talked about it my
ninth favorite is getting blowouts which
I feel like sounds so dumb but literally
the first time I got a blowout was over
winter break and I was like how have I
never done this before it was like the
best ever
and then two days ago I went to dry bar
and I've never been to drive hour before
and I was like this place is literally
me like how have I not been here before
I was like what back like it's so pretty
in there everyone's so nice and I'm like
I love it and your hair just feels so
amazing after you go there like they
clean it it smells so good and I just
like love it and yeah I went two days
ago and you just hit like loose curls I
mean it was so pretty and I wanted to
leave it for class today but I went to
SoulCycle this morning so my hair is
just like a sweaty wet mess so I had to
shower and blow-dry but I've been loving
getting blowouts I think I'm just gonna
turn into one of those girls that's a
obsessed with Drybar and goes like once
a week but hopefully not because it's
kind of expensive my 10th favorite is
actually this lifeproof case that is on
my new phone right now and I don't know
if you guys saw my blog but basically
last Monday I got the iPhone at 7 plus
like do you see how big this thing is
like I can't like when I text like my
favorite doesn't reach across and yeah
it's just massive but literally 19 hours
after I got it I dropped it
in Boston on the street and a guy picked
it up and luckily returned it to me like
thank God for Good Samaritans but anyway
it's out of my pocket and yeah I don't
you can see underneath the cover see
it's all cracked on there literally the
reason I got a new phone is cuz my old
one was so cracked so it's really
upsetting and also the day I got this
phone I ordered the lifeproof case
online but it came like the day after it
cracked so awesome but yeah it's just
been a favorite this month because it's
made it so that I don't crack my phone
anymore and don't mess it up any more
than it already is all right Pete it was
a literally record time for how quick I
cracked my phone it was like 19 20 hours
and normally it's like at least a month
but how do I just get this screen fix
that Apple seen and then it'll be safe
and I need my case and then I won't have
a cracked phone for a while ideally so
that was it for my February favorites
this month guys I really hope you
enjoyed thank you guys so much for
watching this video and I'll see you my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
