that sounds really extreme if you're not
wearing makeup you look like put
together like these they have like a
personality of their own happy retreat I
don't think have you reminded me
I haven't blogged in very long while
it's gonna be really fun I don't know if
I'm gonna be allowed to walk there I
mean I get with all that yeah yeah it'll
be fun and maybe some people yeah we're
wearing bathing suits underneath here
but I don't know if anyone even has
theirs but oh well at least it's not
like reading you know people that I was
gonna rain but we don't think it's gonna
rain it just gonna be all cold and we'll
cloudy
sneak peek of my room tour I had to film
one of those I should do it before it
gets like too dirty but
are waiting for anyway we made it
Oh baby it smells like the beach I
really just feel like we're in Miami
right now it looks identical to Miami
dear Kolby I love you know we're
Donovan's needed there's ice cream in my
hair and sand everywhere
good morning guys sorry I've been so bad
at vlogging as you can tell I feel it
pretty awful right now I throw it's
really bad and we can't retreat ever I
brought my vlog camera cuz I was like so
excited to blog there and I was like too
busy hanging up my friends all time and
like swimming in the ocean and like in
surround doing gymnastics on the beach
like whatever and this is really sad
right now I don't like cry like pee
motion or anything it's probably ready
cuz I like feel kind of sick whatever
and I just been thinking I like the
semester is really hard for me because
like not only it so serious she's like
part of like my daily support system but
also like being core is really roughen I
don't know if I've talked about it much
like other videos but it's just like
really intensive working with ten people
on a team and you're like always meeting
and then you have class for hours every
day but really it's like kind of
question like tend to like sex law dates
cuz we meet before and after because you
just like do things and meet
deliverables as a team and it's just
like air exhaust you can take what out
of you and then like with YouTube like
don't get me wrong like you makes me a
gap you thought about anything like it's
like my favorite thing ever but then I
almost feel like being behind on videos
continuously like makes me stressed I'm
like there's so much footage that's like
was hitting my computer but I just like
don't have time to edit cuz like I need
to sleep like doing it working better
and I'm and I'm trying to be better but
right just movies home are intent videos
and then I almost feel like if I have
time to do it I'm like so stressed I
feel so pressured they have to put it up
that I just like doesn't get done cuz I
like a freak out so much about it I
don't know that he can make sense I know
I'm like trying me about every time
management it's really hard especially
and I feel absolutely awkward now I
think I like or something yeah let me
say cool because I guess I enough made a
commitment let me go probably our best
time I feel like feels like but I don't
know I just think have to go hopefully I
like make there in one piece don't pass
out again
there's no way
probably
three weeks after filming yeah because
it's my fault I just yeah like I hope
you all so much in your support means
like everything to me and like I want to
go on tour soon and like you can tell
like I finally decorated but yeah just
note I'm trying my best to make bear
with me this semester because it's
really rough and like I don't mix in
YouTube is definitely take me to my
social life do you like to everything I
do yeah I hope you could understand what
I was saying hey guys so sorry no I like
freaked out that's whining I was just
feeling like really overwhelmed but
obviously voice still horrible but um I
actually feel like a lot better after
going to solos with James Oh obviously
guys that was like my day one oh gee
heart and soul love him and it's
actually soul survivor class which I
forgot that's what I booked us 4,000
hours at a 45 minutes but let me just
tell you guys life hack like honestly I
don't even notice the difference between
the 60 minutes in the 45 minutes but
it's all the same price so like if
you're one of those people I think soul
is like way too expensive which like it
is kind of pretty expensive you know
then maybe you'll feel like you're
getting your money's worth if you go to
them China for sole survivor yeah I
really like known as no difference
between 45 points in 60 minutes which is
what I just said but I just kept the
resistance like way down so that I could
like stand the beat in whenever and yeah
it was like really great and actually on
Friday I think I might just like push
myself to everybody because I was still
like feeling like this like sounding
like this and then after SoulCycle I was
also in the front row so I feel like
that pushes me harder and today I was
just in the second row so then I didn't
feel like the resistance had to be like
way up and like really like going after
you know it like set a good example
I don't know yeah like Friday I probably
pushed it was you hard and I also I
noticed I feel like in this 60-minute
classes
so I feel like don't even care about
this at all but in the 60 minute classes
I think there's a lot more like slower
cadence like songs like more like
climbing instead of a really fast pace
like right left right left right looking
you know I'm saying so I feel like the
45 minute classes are maybe more like
intensive this whiteboard five minutes
minute 60 minute classes are more like
chill cuz really good spaced out but I
knew yeah I'm finally like felt like
this after so like felt worse obviously
I couldn't like to speak at all and I
went to dinner with my friends and
they're like are you good I couldn't
speak at all but yeah I actually feel
really good that I went just drink a lot
of water I just went to the dining hall
with my sisters and that was really nice
to see them I was a di wonder supposed
to go with fatty and Natalie and at
least my big and then adding you guys
over this summer and I was gonna bring
my camera but then I was like freaking
out this morning and being like crazy so
I was like don't bring your camera just
so like live your life and yeah I love
like sharing my life with you guys but
if you haven't noticed I've been like
really more blogging and especially
bringing my blog my place is like mostly
me like standing here in my room like
telling you about things I didn't sort
of like showing you which is obviously
way more entertaining and I'm gonna get
better at doing that but I don't know
since I've been getting like so
overwhelmed and stuff like bring my blog
camera with me and like try need good
footage almost feels like a chore and
like I'm interrupting the moments I'm
having and like the memories and shared
with my friends to be like wait I need
to get my camera out and like film it if
that makes any sense
I don't know like it shouldn't be like
that and I don't want to be like that so
that's why I'm kind of trying to find
like a balance with everything but you
probably think I sound like second right
now I don't I don't even know that's
basically it it is now like 11 something
I'm gonna happen the shower 5:00 p.m. I
have eaten meeting with my team to get
some deliverables time for an Operations
presentation I forgot I'm presenting
tomorrow and hopefully my team is okay
with me is everything absolutely awful
maybe I should wait till my voice sounds
better but then I'll definitely film
like a room tour for you guys like it
totals me because you can't see at all
anyway and apartment tour soon because
last year I really really really really
wanted to do a sweet tour but it just
never happened because living with a
people it was so hard to coordinate and
make sure it all like looked nice and
like now just with four people so it's
like a lot easier so yeah sorry I never
do
maybe I can like show you guys like my
friends sweet so that you can see like
what it looks like you too if you're
interested because I know a lot of
people find me through like my room tour
videos and like the BU room tour videos
that I make are really helpful for
people going to be you because there
wasn't really other like bu room tours
or at least it's like help people some
nothing do that soon as a nap goodbye
you're just bending and doing like
homework old a mostly other than cuz it
takes me a while and I've been meaning
to show you guys so I'm buzzed like
throw on these puppies because it's
really bright out it's almost like 5:00
p.m. and like since they're polarized
they make like everything what kind of
different you know well they're Selleck
reflective too but yeah I just think
these are so fun and so big and like
obviously right now look like I just put
on eyebrows and I scared about Lee's
know like face makeup I like wearing
really big sunglasses they cover like so
much of your face so like I said if
you're not wearing makeup used to look
like put together so I like love big
sunglasses it makes me so happy that
these are so big oh and I didn't even
say they are from if I wear I just got
four pairs of sunglasses from them so I
just wanted to let you guys know about
them
agencies especially are so cool and I
made all my friends like try them on and
like because I haven't really big head
and they're still like big on me cuz I
look like big ones so then they like a
really big I'm like all my friends but
like I love the oversized look at them
you know I'll just show you two other
pairs like it's two really quick
actually one of the pink I got a pair of
pink like reflective radiator radiators
what are they called baby
yep struggle City up in here is that the
ones I wear to the beach all day
yesterday and also like so cute I'm
obsessed
love these ones and then these like
tortoiseshell blue or flicked how cute
are these oh and I'm gonna have to link
down below so you guys can find these
puppies and check them out yourself when
the last ones are also super vague so
obviously I love them
when they all come in cases up click
this by the way which is really nice so
you can tap protect each other just
throwing them and your
really many like me and then breaking
important nice sunglasses the means I
just thought were so fine in sassy and
different like look at these they have
like a personality of their own like so
yeah I just think these are all really
fun I'm going to be putting on my
original pair 20 meeting now in two
blocks all the haters so yeah tomorrow
so guys it is right around 6:30 p.m. now
and oh wait did I even I know last I
blogged was last night right before I
went to my team meeting which went past
8:00 I was so tired and I was like get
me out of here like I love my team but I
was like guys guys we've been meeting
for over two hours I feel like so we
think right now I gotta go I actually
just went to Urgent Care and that sounds
really extreme but like I love you bu
but Student Health here isn't like the
best in my opinion and it made me sound
like a brat but basically I went like
once we beginning in my freshman yet and
they wouldn't even let me see a doctor
and they were like oh yeah sounds like
you just have a cold like go buy some
cough drops and like a thermometer and I
was like wait like I can't see a doctor
and they were like no and I was like
okay great where I go in brookline it's
called partners urgent care and I get it
sounds like a treatment it's called the
urgent kept basically it's just like
seeing a doctor yeah I like going there
cuz you're like in and out really quick
and it's like really nice and the people
are really nice um I take you seriously
so then like last fall when I went like
fall of my sophomore year I was in and
out super quick they tested me for mono
and were like yo you're positive you
have mono and I was like oh my god are
you kidding me so then like if I went to
Student Health it would have taken me
longer they probably wouldn't be even
tested me for mono or it would have
taken longer to get an appointment or
hear back you know what I mean so anyway
that's just why I go there and I was
like pretty sure that I didn't have
strep cuz my tonsils aren't like huge or
like anything horrible like that but um
I just want to make sure because I
didn't have mono Westfall then I had
strep this summer and I'm like I just
don't play around with being sick
anymore and like obviously I'm sick
right now so no strep good news just
have a virus so like send strep is like
bacterial you take in a biotic so
remember but if you just have a virus
all you could really do is like take
ibuprofen and feel like your symptoms
and like oh my God my head hurts so bad
right now my just always hurts but it's
fine I'll get through it I have to go to
CVS because I have two prescriptions I
should pick up I'm getting like a nose
break because I'm just like extremely
congested and that's what
causing me to cough now I think I'm in
like a prescription like throat like I
don't know if you drink her if it's just
like a swishy thing so that kind of
numbers you're throwing a little bit in
case it really hurts because I was like
yeah it's a nice wallow cuz I like heard
seafood good my throat weren't so bad
but whatever just a virus
college kids get sick all the time I
know like everyone is sick right now I
like even some other kids my team are
sick let me show you but I just cooked
for dinner cuz I was like you know
Gretchen you're not letting sickness get
you down like I had to take a day off
from working out today because I was
like I just didn't take a break for the
last like a week or longer I don't even
know because I just like I'm so obsessed
with psycho that I can't like not go but
I was like a chicken tikka die off like
rest like you need it but I was like I'm
not gonna let this slow me down so it's
true Jo's got some groceries and made
teriyaki tofu which is like my favorite
