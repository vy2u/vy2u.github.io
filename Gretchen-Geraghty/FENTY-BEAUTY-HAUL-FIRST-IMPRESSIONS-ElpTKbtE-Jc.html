guys knew Maggie McDonald okay YouTube
is literally it perfect I was s other
vlogs you definitely go check it out
but yeah Maggie talked so much about 50
and I know her and her sister and I use
it so I just really have been wanting to
try it out for myself you don't
recognize me right now it's because I
really didn't know face makeup on and
then I just put on a mascara and I
rounds this morning I'm trying out the
middle part can you guys let me know
what you think because I feel like it's
really weird I don't like to recognize
myself because I always part on the side
first thing I'm going to the box for you
guys is the Fanta beauty by Rihanna Pro
filters soft matte Walmart Foundation oh
that was Mac fault I got the shade 150
something that I thought would be a fun
little twist on his haul video is if I
could like try it out first thing for
your daughters look right now Oh baby
and it's a little white woman that was
pretty mad she told me that it does
oxidize the FMT Beauty foundations are
really known for like 5-10 minutes just
getting a lot darker because of so I'm
back in crazily enough when I was just
putting it on you guys didn't look like
so light but I think like oxidizing like
look at it literally matches me it's
like perfect I don't even know if I need
to get a good darker shade or anything
before I show you my next product before
I forget to mention this video it's
actually sponsored by YouTube but thank
you so much you do but for sponsoring
this video because this is going to be a
part of their new unboxing channel and
this is going to be in like an unboxing
playlist that is just gonna show like a
whole bunch of fun new products for the
holiday season being on Bob's shows let
me go check that out so you guys can see
some fun new products coming you ready
for this holiday season yeah I just
thought this would be like perfect to
show you guys unboxing all of these fun
new affinity products that I've been
wanting to try out anyway so the next
thing I have to show you guys it says it
is the efendi beauty by Rihanna gloss
balm universal lip Luminizer and the
reason I actually got this shut up broke
Ameche oh hey Brooke when we were at
stock on this past weekend in LA I was
like what is on your lips it's literally
perfect her lips were like glowing and
like so glossy and beautiful and she's
like it's too funky like lip gloss I'm
like I need that so literally guys look
at this
baby
I smell so good I got the 50 beautyberry
on a matchstick trio conceal contour
highlight look they all come like oh my
gosh this is so cool I didn't know they
did this maybe the eye shadows be my
gosh who's with him oh look at this I
might as well just show you this right
now this is the galaxy eyeshadow palette
Baba with all of those shades but the
reason I got it is because they are all
just so shimmery and beautiful looking
perfect present here we I actually love
like the color of it though I love the
nose contour chip and you're done I
might as well to limit in which is the
concealer that's normally hard to get my
kid to are doing a bunch underneath my
eyes like that oh I know you've seen me
sitting here to add some definition do
you guys think I might have blended it
too much I think I sort of looked like I
looked away before it let's do some
starstruck highlighter I'm all about oh
it actually got highlighter too so you
will do this as a good base and then
we'll put the powder highlighter on top
so the highlight our guys 50 Beauty by
Rihanna kilowatt freestyle highlighter
duo illuminator Libre in the shade mean
money and hustle a baby
I enjoy the packaging as well okay so it
looks like there's like two shades or
both of eyeliners like I guess I like
this one more cuz it looks a little more
shiny and you know what I don't feel
like getting a brush so I think I just
can use my fingers because that's what
you can do with highlighter if you want
it to be really whole okay okay okay
yep I enjoy this and I just cracked my
third like like a highlighter so this is
what I'm gonna be using I guess we I
really enjoy that it's like not too much
it might even be more subtle than the
back of one which is good cause the back
of one
get like hola if you guys know what I'm
saying to deal with the end of my nose
as well as a middle okay so this is what
I've been using like the makeup mirror
the whole time and these shades I know I
showed you before but there's so much
shimmery and again I don't really get my
makeup brushes so can I just use my
fingers I'm sorry for all the real
makeup artists out there it's gonna
bother you but like I really just want
you about fingers right now so I need to
yep I'm showing them my new eyeshadow
palette muses brown color that's it oh
my god it was so yeah you can talk you
can tell them how your day went but I
really like this brown color it's like
really shimmery I think you're supposed
to do like a lighter color and then a
darker color but I'm just gonna do all
the dark color I really like it we'll
get out pull the packaging is to see
it's all like shiny without your
disguise yeah whoo this shiny like um
white silver color we actually love this
okay you want to do the outro with me
