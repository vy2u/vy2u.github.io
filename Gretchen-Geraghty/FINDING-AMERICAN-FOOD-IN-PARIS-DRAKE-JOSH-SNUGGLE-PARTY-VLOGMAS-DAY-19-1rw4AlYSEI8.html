man how do you loose down an hour metro
ride to a different post facility

Tasha and my mom have been like
exploring Paris and I'm so scared that
we're literally invisible to the road

course
so Lucy has been on a wild goose chase
all day for her phone and yesterday as

stuck in furnish customs like a
beautiful maiden joining today I think
it looks great
oh it's cousin it but yeah so Lucy is
searching for her phone cell but
frederique so I Cartier Metro back and
Rebecca's apartment
yes frederique explained to us that you
could attack survive because if you're
not a French citizen you don't have to
pay for his taxes and oh yeah another
thing is her it's all I got the cartier
jewelry
and it's a steal
it's literally a deal I was like I'm
saving money but oh yeah so we showed
the tour like weeks ago Express and then
it's been stuck in customs and then they
just stole our yesterday that she would
have to pay $175 euro tax on the phone
she's literally no friend she's just a
student so hopefully she can get it back
maybe if she has to pay it if she even
gets her phone that is because we're
leaving in two days but you know we'll
