Year's Eve I knew I knew him either so -
because I was there yep
with Abby you remember and when the city
that feels like yesterday
oh yeah
honestly don't like people that have
literally done nothing to you at all
like if you just see somebody like out
and you're like oh my god like she's so
ugly like why would you even ever think
of doing that like is it making you feel
that are like really what is it doing
for you to say something about somebody
else like it's just like I don't know
it's lately I've been feeling so guilty
about like ever doing that yes
and lately have known so wealthy for
like ever doing that to anybody like
that I just like don't even know where
like I'm not even close with and I'm
just like why is she doing this like
it's her life when it's nothing to do
with me and like it doesn't affect me at
all you just shouldn't talk bad about
people that have done nothing to you at
all like honestly and now we're gonna
plug Manny this is so oh we're splitting
when me and Julia got the cheesy Oh papi
eat spaghetti with you
is that how you eat it are you teaching
them this is really good by day we have
a question for you guys if anyone has a
question to defense is gonna say if oh
my god I literally have a confession let
us know below because it can be really
juicy but their names can be like
anonymous so I want to know because if
it's like vague and not like people's
names like then occasionally you should
get off your chest you can just yeah but
if you like if you feel like jamming you
like killing someone jealous please
don't don't tell us anything you don't
want to know if you like froze your cat
guys until miss before that when she was
videoing me that there was like a black
or about a black aura on like my present
