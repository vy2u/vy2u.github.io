sitting out at our kitchen table and I'm
eating some breakfast it's my favorite
breakfast I eat oatmeal and peanut
butter banana like every day say it
drizzled some honey on tops and that
cinnamon is good and I'm just editing
some videos I'm in core this semester in
the business web you question core is it
pretty rough so I'm a little nervous
forest so I'm going to ski of course we
have class 12 to 4 every day and then we
have team meetings for like two three or
four hours other parts of the day
depending on when our team decides to
get any group of probably seven or eight
people and the whole semester you just
make a business from start to finish
like the marketing operations finance
academic all around it yeah that should
be really interesting
hopefully my group get along super well
and it goes awesome so I'm like excited
it's using my class and everything
I actually think Sasha is in
all my classes but we probably won't be
here missing group since we know each
other may try to pair you as people that
you don't know to get experience of
people let you jump now breaking care

early because he was working but the app
I'm gonna shower super quick started
like from my camera to spit wreck or

first day class I don't even know what
my outfit is are now no one judge me
first day at school Bob yeah it's your
last verse as you last first day look
everyone
Sasha's outfit of the day so shirt
shorts and boots so stylish love so
Taylor how was your first day
yeah and you met with your advisor and
that was like 20 people just really and
so you might not live in you know I'm
officially sort of kind of comes to yay
my homie went from bio to health science
to IR to PR what you wanna know
something
I need switched colleges every single
time you switch major events trying to
think what I majored is inserted and it
wasn't coming from health science are
you sure yes cuz you move to I like how
I know and you know you unless you were
both just general health and you didn't
really know like I don't know what I
want to do but all I know is I will be
an orthopedic surgeon and I was like oh
yeah girl get it she's not gonna be a
surgeon no way it was a deferred my
first day of court was great it was a
bit intimidating my team seems awesome
are you taking a video or picture of me
vlogging and then no you only say that I
miss video I had to do my makeup in five
minutes because Sasha threatened to
leave without me and then we were like
an hour early but it's also good okay so
man oh yeah so my team seems really
promising one guy I know I feel like
this is real that I'm like talking about
them in my blog but yeah whatever
they'll probably end up seeing this cuz
we're gonna all end up being like best
friends like you would all become best
friend because you spend so much time
together but yeah one guy my team Aidan
felishj I say his name I don't know
one guy in my team is my friend's
boyfriend and he's like super smart and
help me study for an exam before so it's
really cool that I really kind of know
him and know that he is really smart and
then my buddy Evan he was in my team for
my intro business class and like
something about asked him 131 like that
team just has my heart because it was
like my first team and the business
school and you feel so like happy about
you like are finally is the business
school so you have like passes to get in
and we have like classes together and
stuff since then so then I walk into
class and I see you and I was like yeah
and then since we were put in the same
group like it was so great and then
Sasha and I are in the same section but
we weren't in the same group which
worked out well because we tend to fight
a lot it's about all in class because
people won't think I'm weirder than I
already a.m. and oh yeah we can we're
gonna make it a corn survive my dad goes
anything fun today I go bloody acorn
squash she's like that's what you call
fun oh and they talked a lot about like
obviously I could have integrity all the
scary stuff but then they were saying
how you want to like film a class or
something it's like a friend that's sick
or like record something whatever like
you have to ask us and saying how if you
would reproduce the material that you
get like online because websites won't
pay I probably didn't even say this in
the video because then people are gonna
like look into it like do it and I think
it's bad but websites
apparently there's websites out there
that'll pay students for the materials
they get in their classes that look at
university because like bu owns it all
and it's like obviously good stuff that
we're learning and like these questions
you can ask people so that they're
learning
so then websites will like buy it from
students who will sell it even though
it's not there so it's like yeah
actually really illegal and like bad and
I was like that's crazy
I remember my law teacher like saw that
her exams were posted online and she was
like who in the heck posted these like
it was one of my students you know she's
like I'm gonna find them because Matt
wouldn't you be so mad if you were a
teacher and that happened anyway so I
won't be filming any core classes
anytime soon but maybe I can like show
around question if you guys haven't seen
it before I think I've showed it in
other videos
two clips have closed right you know
being in college is so tired things so
you just take naps I like forth yeah I'm
kidding
Taylor hey snap she refuses to take naps
oh wait also I got my textbooks which I
didn't think we had any for some reason
but um I thought we just learned you
know there was just to talk to us I
don't know the four parts of core our
marketing operations stats finance and
so I had to get all those to remake it
acorn squash new and we're gonna make
some teriyaki tofu oh and my dress for
the first day was like a little
scandalous but um I broke my romper I
was gonna wear so yeah yeah mommy will
sew it home look where-where's I see a
lot of comments on my blogs already
being like oh I want other people in
your vlogs they seem like so unhappy
like I like like i annoy people</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
