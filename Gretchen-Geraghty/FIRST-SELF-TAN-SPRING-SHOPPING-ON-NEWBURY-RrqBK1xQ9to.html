you have like a car mount though people
will have a car mount and like the next
day I just need to talk to guys really
quick you guys know I've been like
traveling like crazy and just like

think just Coachella makes everyone so
sick and obviously you run your body
into the ground you don't sleep enough
and you're like running around in the
Sun all day and like super dehydrated

about this app called personal Beauty
wellness and basically it's just an app

convenient and whatever okay let's do
screen recording so you go into personal
Beauty wellness and then for your type
of service needed I'm gonna look at
massages because I'm just like dying

favorite I'm gonna use 60 minutes just
cuz that's what I like normally do and
then you type in where you are so
obviously I'm in Boston and then I'll
just come up with a good list of places
but what I like is you can see right
here it says service at your location or
service at the consult
