you can't tell from my voice it sounds
like I slept in today because yesterday
I finished my core business plan which
was just like the most unreal feeling
ever cuz it's all we've been working on
like oh so master and like we're not
done yet we still have to present it and
everything and we have final exams but
that's like we're like pretty much time
like that's like everything that we've
been working towards in last night I was
like I feel like I need to like be doing
work like they're like it doesn't feel
real real that I'm like dad I don't know
it was so weird but um I have to pack
for Paris because I'm going to Paris
today so guys I just made a nice table
literally turned out so good turned out
really like thank you Miyabi but I
always have to eat before I work out
girl cuz I'm really scared of passing
out so I'm gonna do this and then I'm
going to head to the chips so guys I
just got back from the gym not just like
a little while ago I've been like
sitting on my computer watching some
YouTube videos or downloading some
videos for my play later I just want to
talk to you guys really quick like I did
working out is just so important and
even if it's not like you don't need to
go to the gym for like two hours you
know I mean you don't be like crazy
person works out a million hours day
everyday I like what I was do you would
remember like freshman year like working
out three hours six days a week is just
like so much really intends you know cuz
I just like it makes your energy like so
much better you like feel better during
the day I actually feel like I've heard
to helps prevent you from getting sick
and I'm like always getting sick like
I'm literally bringing a z-pack to Paris
with me just in case I get to say cuz
every time I travel I get sick my doctor
was like just praying about it with you
in case you get sick but then obviously
if I don't get sick that I won't even
use them I gotta go
like wash my face and shower and stuff
and then actually start packing for
Paris because I don't really packed yet
I'm leaving in a couple hours
so I just got out of the shower I feel
so fresh and clean I love the feeling
right after you got the shower and you
like put on your moisturizer like brush
out your hair but one thing I want to
show you guys really quick I'm still
using this spin brush it's the vanity
planet spin for perfect skin skin just
like exfoliating brush sorry it's all
that right now cuz in the shower so I
know I've talked about this before I
actually saw the purple one if that was
at home I have the green one to guy this
is literally my skincare secret I would
say for the winter especially because my
skin gets like so dry and I need to make
sure I'm exfoliating it and this little
guy is so good at exfoliating then right
put my moisturizer on after I get a
shower it's like night and day like my
skin feels like butter it's so soft and
like it does not feel this soft if I
just wash it like normally you know I
just felt that it's like waterproof so
that's so nice cuz it's like way quicker
for me to just wash my face in the
shower than like doing outside of the
shower I know like exfoliating skin
brushes like this can use so expensive
like my roommates right here and this is
the Clarisonic yeah see like the
Clarisonic I know or like insanely
expensive in my opinion this is like the
exact same job or maybe even better does
what else could you ask for like look at
my skin it's like glowing and this I
think normally is pretty expensive but
I've used my code at Gretchen spins you
can actually get 70% off which is so
insane so we get this right now use my
code right now because I think you can
get it for like $30 which is like
actually insane comment down below so
you guys can check it out if you're
interested
oh wait so I don't think I want to show
you is I know I've talked about this guy
before
literally I use purity from philosophy
from Sephora for like years now we can
you guys comment down below do you
remember that haul video the first time
I ever spent purity it was like years
ago and I wasn't like that with the top
to try to smell it and it like went like
that on my nose do you guys remember
that haul video if any of you saw your
the real day one anyway I want to show
that because I want to give you guys
like a little update at my skincare so
obviously using the vanity planet like
spin brush doesn't make my skin like so
soft and clear and I think a lot of it
too is that just kind of like grown out
of my acne phase I'm now 20 years old
and you guys know that used to struggle
with acne so bad and I literally tried
everything I went to dermatologists I
was on a bunch of different medication I
might do my topical medicines I tried
like literally every skincare system and
like lotion to push
whatever I think would have come to
realize is your students kind of gonna
be how it's gonna be and at least that's
how mine is and then just like taking
care of it as best I can
and just like kind of letting it wade
out and letting like time take its
course and growing up and being an adult
it kind of like goes away I think that's
what I've learned the most literally
just using like a really nice and gentle
cleanser like that purity one has really
worked for me a moisturizer like a
really good moisturizer I'm almost out
of this puppy it's like very like hollow
and empty if you can see because I've
used like this whole tub so this is
getting so long but I know I used to
mention and one skincare video like I
used to be so scared of like really big
thick like moisturizing creams even
moisturizer in general because my skin
would be oily so I'm like why would I
use moisturizer but then my
dermatologist was actually like no like
if your skin's like visibly oily like
deep down it's so dry and it's producing
more oil so you need to make sure using
moisturizer like that's a really big tip
to use moisturizer even if you don't
want to like I use a day-night now I use
that really thick cream and it's made my
skin so much better like it makes it way
more like clear and soft and like
healthy especially after I exfoliate I
always follow up with like a really good
moisturizer so I pretty much just use
that purity face cleanser I'll use my
spin brush here and there and then like
a really thick and nice moisturizer
guys look at this new dress I got like
seriously how cool is it I'm just like
packing right now for Paris and I know
that I'm gonna wear this Friday night
we're going to London and I got a
servation at Nobu and I'm gonna be extra
AF and wear this like a really nice it's
like I don't know how to describe it
it's like velvet and sequins like can
you tell it's so neat anyway I'm gonna
keep packing it so I'm finally about to
leave now and I wanted to show you guys
I got this cup of fruit I just ran into
a star market right nearby really quick
because I wanted to get some snacks and
some traveling for so long so
strawberries blueberries Kiwis and then
I found this little bag of pretzel
crisps mini gluten free vanilla yogurt
and I thought that was legit I'm not
like gluten for anything but I just
thought it looks good so I'm actually
leaving I just have my backpack because
I'm only going for like 4 days so I'm
just packing really light and then
drinking some my healthy kombucha I got
the Pink Lady Apple flavor and I just
drank the pomegranate on the other day
and I
like only just started having the Health
Aide kombucha after I went to style con
la because I'd like a booth there and I
tried it and literally it's my favorite
kombucha like I'm so happy I tried it I
think I was just scared cuz there's in
this brown bottle so I get looked scary
to me but it's literally so good guys
it's definitely my favorite over the
other one - what's the other one
everyone drinks I've had it way more
before this one synergy is how it's
called I think the synergy one I don't
like as much as this one this one's just
so good
