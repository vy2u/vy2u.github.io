good it's like I feel like that tapes
been blessed when Gucci out of all the
time - Chuck yeah it's like sweet but
it's definitely just an acquired taste
in this one it's like different yeah you
do that one first because I think it's
Peter like this one ginger berries and
this was not even about it's not even
that gingery there's ones that are like
a more ginger but that's better I don't
really taste the ginger beverage peeling
becomes what really got her liver some

eggs this is really hard if I do would
look at the water I can do it but I
don't wanna like ruin a bunch of eggs
trying to do it you know but I really
okay we're gonna try it one more time
and if I do that again yeah guys I did
it it looks like a big blob like
mozzarella cheese okay and I know I
probably speed up something of water I
think my dad always did it didn't really
look like that but see I put it in the
middle and then you swirl yeah guys I
thought this one's better off look I
think it still yeah it's like soft on
the outside this one I feel like that's
like totally raw and this is like really
hard but you know what looks good to me
and we still have to keep watching 13
years and why well I'm a 2nd season and
it's just like making me like I just
want to like scream and like be there so
I can fix it you know you know what the
movies like that we're just like oh my
god can't you see you're like look I
just wanna be like to this school can't
you see that Tyler is like been bullied
for so long like we feel so bad for
Tyler I'm like no what happens to at the
end and I can't think about it I'm gonna
I know I'm gonna skip the episode I just
can't that's so scary
also I'm not scary the poster that's in
the apartment that were subletting from
I never really wanted to show it in a
video because we thought it was so scary
but you probably just noticed it in the
background does anyone know where this
is from or like what it is I think it
looks like art like famous or something
but it could just even like Target like
I don't know but it kind of scares us we
need to put something over it I don't
like that her nose is bleeding
why don't I hate well that's it kind of
cool but I just like gives me the
heebie-jeebies when people like on
Instagram will go like that and you like
pop the yolk another thing and it's just
like everywhere
yeah okay I'm gonna do it oh wait I did
it make the perfect consistency it said
like I said it shouldn't be too runny
but it should be like that yay guidance
comes er scares me understand he says
okay I'm on episode 10 and it goes to
episode thirteen and I want to watch so
bad but I have to go to my eyelashes
done in like an hour and I have to
shower before and louise has been
wanting to pluck my eyebrows for like a
week now they're so bad I do them
literally once a year I don't know if
y'all can tell oh yeah you can kind of
see they just like I don't know I just
like don't have it in me to pluck him
and they're not that good anyway like
you guys know I let them grow out but
then like this one so much better than I
something like what like let me know
like why is that the way it is I also
feel like I need to put like oils and my
eyebrows or something to make them grow
because they get so sparse balls they're
like growing up like ever since if you
like baby pictures my eyebrows right
there are just like non-existent
something they look all wonky like this
one's so messed up
coming so I'm sorry short please just
plucking my eyebrows okay yeah it's like
she literally fixed them it looks like I
just got them like wax look at how good
she did it okay bear with me I know my
eyebrows aren't great like that she
couldn't fix
but the underneath part is so good I
just can't see it like it looks so much
better
yeah because normally my eyebrows just
naturally have that weird likeness
easily and I hate it and I never nothing
never knew how to fix it but she figured
out how when you do you're gonna get the
excess out you know just when you get
your one year pierced and then you don't
want to get the other in pierced because
they're so bad I literally was gonna
leave with one ear pierced from Claire's
when I turn
sounds like crying yeah I think the big
ones aren't that bad I took the will one
after many trials and tribulations here
we are
and you okay I'll show you guys when I
put on like eyebrow I don't even use
eyebrow pencil anymore I used to use
eyebrow pencil now I just used the
anastagia powder because others little
eyebrow hairs all over the whole time so
guys friends playing friends is thing
but I just got my eyelashes done from
wing cat does such a good job and
Maggie's actually there right now so
it's funny because I'm going to Cape Cod
with her when she's done but I didn't
even see her there cuz I left before she
got there like oh and I just put on i'm
foundation i use the i was just sort of
david dr. jart CC cream or BB cream
where have i been i use that like
forever ago but actually i'm not right
you're just gonna be good right now okay
there we go but i just wanted to show
you i just put on I used the a cosmetic
CC cream and I'm I've been using the age
or Wynd
concealer but the reason I'm is showing
is right now my makeup is because I have
seen these brushes around YouTube and
just Instagram for so long but I never
tried him out but I had like a side of
them that I've always been mean to try
and they're from Danny bland it by the
way which I've been using their brushes
and like face like a scrubby brushes for
so long The Ultimates games 5 and using
lot recently I'm gonna show you a video
soon but this isn't supposed to read
numb or anything but I just thought it
was really cool when I put it on I
really like enjoyed myself but you just
feel like you're like brushing your face
oh actually in the set it comes a
smaller run so I should be using the
smaller ones through this book I don't
feel like getting it isn't as cool and
you ain't go like that when you like
blending your makeup it was like so fun
so I just thought I should show you back
to being myself
show them your eyelashes
yeah I put I put um I get this like
black eyelash serum so it just makes
them like can I go and say hi I was like
I caught everybody by they're like full
name yeah that's my hair has been
straight for three days and I've been
even curly I mean curly are we going

always see like there there's like
splashes of light on you I always try to
fire yeah we I feel like she's too much

of yeah whenever I go somewhere yes
that's better than I always try to look
for a good pictures Bach plays are so

metered parking but then behind the
metered parking there's just like open
road is it free because there's no signs

like you can tell that it's not on a
meter you know because look it's right
here and then those are the metered cars
what if there's a ticket oh we're doing

dark at really really dark it looks like
it's still day yeah yeah oh yeah and so
I don't know if you driven this type but
people always get confused about that
