not even 9:30 right now and I just
finished my first class it's like such a
great feeling the hardest part is
getting up and I'm like up and awake and
ready for the day so that's really why I
scheduled an 8 a.m. for the semester and
I'm like so sorry that I didn't though
I'm like dead tired right now but
luckily when my roommates left out Oreos
so I ate one before lecture and now I'm
gonna eat some after just the healthiest
of breakfast for 2018 right guys but I
wanted to show you guys I just got a
bunch of packages from my mail room and
I'm so excited about it and especially
this one from Smashbox because I love
them so much and I can't wait to open up
and see what's inside guys well look at
how cute this Smashbox packages I can't
get over it and it's like a little
camera lens one of the other packages I
got so this is something I've been
wanting it to talk to you guys for a
while now and lucinei mention it really
briefly in one vlog a while back in the
summer but now I can finally tell you
more about it specifically so if you saw
the vlog before Lucy and I mentioned it
briefly basically we are leading a trek
to machu picchu and mid-august i'll put
the dates exactly right here I forget
them off the top of my head if you guys
remember when I climbed Mount
Kilimanjaro I climbed with choose a
challenge which is basically like this
organization that's what we're doing it
with again and what's so great about
them I guess it's more of a good thing
and Europe like we didn't really know
about it and told my friend showed it to
me and then that's how I kind of met
Kilimanjaro but basically you fund
raised a bunch of money to go and half
the money that you fundraise goes to a
charity that you partner with and then
the other half goes to like trip costs
like flights whatever stuff like that so
the charity that we get to work with
again which I'm so excited about is
b-positive foundation because you guys
remember me talking about them I still
have my little pocket on the back of my
phone because I just love them so much I
love that they donate to research for
trehala cancer and I also like that they
can help really payments for families
affected by childhood cancer and what I
really like too is when I talked about
them before a bunch of you guys actually
commented saying that you knew Andrew
McDonough which his parents are the ones
that started the p+ foundation and I
just I love their charity I could talk
forever about it so anyway basically
we're partnering with the people hostage
foundation again to fundraise for them
which I'm so excited about so this trick
is actually the one at two at Machu
Picchu not Kilimanjaro
and it's a lot easier than Kilimanjaro
which I am excited for because
Kilimanjaro was the hardest thing I've
done in my entire life
by far and I wouldn't even say
physically like obviously physically it
was extremely challenging but mentally
was the hardest part so I learned a lot
and we looked super life-changing you
can go watch my Africa vlogs I think I
post them all on what used to be Lucy's
might well channel so now I need you but
just Co Lucia ready if you want to see
more about that but the reason I'm
talking about this so all those flowers
right there that I just got are for our
information meeting it is on January
25th it's at 7 p.m. in CIS here at
Boston University and I just wanna let
you guys know about it because I know
some of you that watched my blogs go to
Boston University and we're gonna lead a
team around like 20 kids to machu picchu
that are gonna fundraising everything
with us yeah basically Lucy me are just
gonna hold this information meeting with
choose a challenge and the B+ foundation
there's going to be people from Judah
Challenge and the positive and Asian so
we can tell you guys all about it answer
your questions and I just want to really
encourage you guys to come or if you
have any friends family that go to bu
and you think they would be interested
in this like please let them know
because I really want to get the word
out as much as we can it's just such a
special thing that you can like make
such a difference fundraising for
charity but also go on like a
once-in-a-lifetime trip how might join
me and Lucia Thursday at 7 p.m. it'll be
a great time after I cry Michael
manjaris he's like you know I'd really
like to do something like that like it
would be so fun and I'm like okay let's
go leave a trek to machu picchu okay
everyone misses you in the blog straight
saudis master friends we're going to the
gym I dragged him me I didn't even blog
at the gym I'm so I was just walking on
the treadmill and my thing when I try to
work on in 2018 is to like I think I'm
always trying to be ever since I quit
wrong I'm trying to be more like an
assistant am i working out because I do
work out a bunch but I would just say
not like consistently and what
consistent means to me like I would
rather look at like the same time every
day which probably isn't that realistic
for my like crazy hectic schedule or
whatever but at least like knowing like
what I'm gonna be doing working out
every day I don't know like a night in
here yeah
and Megan's here I get to catch up with
her and I was just about to tell them my
room is a total mess obviously because I
got back last night
but this is gonna be my project this
afternoon doing my laundry cleaning it
all up our favor
I think it's atrocious
I know it's pretty bad it's a V guys
look at her it's crunchy it's so cute
and funky okay we have to go teach Abby
how to do laundry in the laundry room
oh yeah that's what I was supposed to do
from the beginning hear how you're
making progress

we're raising haven't you like the smell
reminds lectured fall semester oh my the
back is so fun right guys look at Abby
oh my gosh where is it from yeah I think
it's from the same place I love and then
this is just like as what chop as I
imagined the bottoms I think oh I think

on today's episode of Gretchen and Abby
I try to narrow her how to do Lodge
the laundry room is here in studio on
the second floor I'm doing three loads
of laundry because I'm now on Janine
like 800 years
I think I'm dollars I three dollars and
89 cents let's see that have to wash
machine number six or human
I think one time I started the round
machine and I was like I love it and
that happens they split up between
dryers and washers they used to be both
that's so confusing
oh my god a dollar 75 good to go I think
really why is it a dollar 75 to wash
things here you think we don't pay
seventy thousand dollars a year for
tuition normal seven minutes your
bhajami complete on the clock really

oh let's just have a chat really quick
let's just be like really real and fun I
just I wanted to tell you guys is I've
noticed recently like ever since like
when I was in Laguna this is when I
really noticed I was like I'm not
wearing any makeup this whole trip
and I feel so like confident and stuff
cuz my skin is so good and I thought
I've talked about skincare so much in my
channel with you guys cuz you know back
in high school I struggled with acne so
bad as I should have I did like freshman
sophomore and junior year I would make
up like two hours before school I'm like
paint my face in makeup because I was so
just like self-conscious and
uncomfortable with my skin but if you
guys know Mandy she's my cousin she's my
channel a bunch her skin is like perfect
right and like Abby's is to every kind
of looks like her Abby just left like
just now my camera ran out of memory for
a quick sec but I think what I was
saying is the mini skinny is like so
perfect I'm like what the heck do you do
right and I've like so many people that
like a really great skin nook oh I like
don't wash my face I'm like what deck
are you talking about like how do you
not wash your face basically what she
does is when she's in the shower she'll
wash her face like sometimes like barely
then every time she or his makeup she
takes him on foot like a Neutrogena
makeup boy and I was like I literally
couldn't do that I feel like my skin
isn't clean enough at Mike if I'm just
using a makeup wife but literally ever
since I've done that like I just started
to wash my face less and I just like use
makeup wipes my skin is so much better
guys like basically what I'm saying is
like doing glasses better Taylor hey can

a little bit less than that and then a
tablespoon of olive oil some salt and
pepper some garlic except we don't have
