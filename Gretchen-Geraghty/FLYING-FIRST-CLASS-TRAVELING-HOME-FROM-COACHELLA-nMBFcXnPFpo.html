now or 7 8 12 a.m. me and Maggie got a
jet we got a really hurry right now
because we're going in a van with
Danielle Brooke and I think Chloe to you
to the airport and their flights leave
at like 11:30 so we're going a little
early with them cuz ours was supposed to
leave at 12:15 but now I just got a
notification that our flight leaves at
3:00 but we should just get there
because we got Delta one seats we
upgraded our seats I don't know if I
talked to you guys about that but I
hadn't be not that much more expensive
so we were like we have a six hour
flight let's just do it so then we can
go hang out and like this guy Delta Sky
Lounge before so I'm like let's just
like get there and chill but I was so
excited because I was just gonna bring
this little guy and like headphones and
stuff because I was like I'm just gonna
sleep on the plane and watch the movies
that are on the plane but then I'm like
now if we're like chilling in the lounge
from her before I'm like switching
everything over into this bag so I can
bring my computer about so it would be
like bored inside and then this way I
can like work on videos and stuff so
yeah that's what's going on I would have
told Maggie like we were just so
freaking tired like you know when you
fall asleep and you wake up in the exact
same position yours like well you okay
literally just like didn't dream didn't
do anything just like passed out and
like it felt like a second passing it
that I was like this and I woke up and I
was like morning trying to fit all our
Suki's is in like
nope oh dang it what do we do oh maybe
it can go in the back with us like on
the ground
I don't house love you I've got to
figure out this Sookie situation
we're at the Starbucks Nikes happy
please Matt you had your little Scorpio
necklace at the joke house I'm so more
sad but yeah we'll figure it out we'll
get it back fences are already there for
so long I bet we can just meet up with
her and get it when does your flight
leave do you know
yeah I'm so healthy so guys update it is
11 currently and we left with MB we
leave like 7:15 maybe 7:30 so we've been
in this car for like almost four hours
and it's crazy there's just so much
traffic going to LAX from Palm Springs
Coachella so Peter does drop out of
today's fit my crops with my t-shirt and
sweat pants okay we're going to check in
but basically what I want to tell you
that's really funny is that Maggie tried
to check in with that cuz we're all
playing Delta but you guys know me and
Maggie upgrades just down to one and
also I just want to do a quick
disclaimer me and Maggie are extremely
excited right now so I don't have any
comments being like we get it you're
playing does one because we're gonna
power say our biggest bash like whoreson
I'm more excited about this than I was
about Coachella
but so sorry we're gonna be annoying but
just like be happy for us okay and
basically we just tried to check in with
them at Delta but then now he was like
no I think it took a separate check-in
so she asked the girl and she's guys
dogs one time they're like to be
checking down there and she was like um
that's for like business in first class
and Maggie was like okay yeah that's
like what we have because you didn't
believe because of like a how we're
tranced what is okay okay so basically
we're really dumb and we were waiting in
sky priority out there for like ever and
then I guess equate what there's a sign
over there this is Delta one check in
and it's like this special little
check-in spot I don't know okay cool
beans
I'm gonna have the apples are wrapped up
in little things that's cute I want this
one this is my favorite oh I need water
to dink dink dink

airport so they're gonna bring us to
this special corridor okay cool we're
going into Super Corridor

something so bye okay so me and Maddie
