holiday for you and it's all from one
store and I just thought it would be fun
to try a small haul video and you guys
can leave your like responses down below
because I realized my videos are so long
and probably so hard to say it through
so I thought we went on one shopping
trip we went to one store we got a
couple things and be able just show it
all to you right now and I just wanted
to see what you guys thought of like
splitting up haul videos into shorter
shopping trips because usually I do like
collected ones over a long period of
time so Lucy and I the other day just
stopped by free people they've super
cute stuff and the only thing forever we
were literally there for probably an
hour and a half but their stuff is like
super pricey but we were just like you
know we're just you drink up self treat
yo'self you were like okay I went a
little wild but you know I was hung Lucy
like sometimes I feel like you just
gotta splurge honestly people say I'm
like crazy like crazy shop or like rap
like no really I'm pretty sensible it is
that I mean I shop a lot but usually I
feel like I pick items that aren't
individually that expensive or all like
fine big deals or like going the
clearance rack whatever you might see
something that's really cute that I love
like say in the front section of urban
are Free People which we all know the
style or like by the window it's so cute
but it's like 80 bucks and you're like I
do not got time for that an angel or
t-shirt but I was like you know if I was
really cute I would get it okay we said
this is me quick videos
first things first I found this dress
and I was like honey that is kayuu
this is just a beautiful like forest
green and those emerald e color I would
say I realized a lot of stuff I got is
like scandalous like cuts really low and
hey there's a theme here this one's cut
really long it's okay but it's like
those cupcakes pose
we don't have boobs we don't there's
like pretty lace details on the front it
like eyes and I love that the straps are
so thin like I think it just looks so
dainty and cute this next thing I'll
show you is the thing that Lucy has in a
matching color I made her get it it's
just this light pink dress it's so
beautiful honest I'm a beautiful piece
almost like a dusty dusty rose and it
goes like really low in the front or
this cut I just been noticing like a lot
I think on dresses and I just think it's
so pretty and the back it's all open it
just has like these two little strings
and it's just really flowy and just
gorgeous
two little strings and I notice that
they had it and a beautiful green color
and I said Lucy you gotta get it yes
Taylor go I knew it was you I got this
dress you wanna come in it's green and
Chinese Vidya you should think it's
really pretty and it has like the
details on the back too and I like how
it's like drapes and like falls it's
really pretty and Chloe it looks so good
on her and yeah a picture already here
when she was wearing it with her Apple
submarine it looked so pretty I caught
the Elsa braid because she does her hair
in this really pretty French braid and
it looks like Elsa that's all that Lucy
got because she wasn't really feeling it
I don't know I feel like it's like
harder for you to find stuff but you're
very like precise and what you like and
like more picky so that's all I got
ideas of what I want and then like so if
you don't find it exactly about me got
it and I'm more like it's pretty I'm on
it yeah this is beautiful good dark gray
tank top it's so different
I had nothing like it was exactly what
it's called it's charcoal it's soft its
ruched in the front I also love the back
because it's all open it just ties 10
out of 10 would recommend I feel like
you're never wear red I don't but it
takes up I'm going to wear it because
I'm used to branch out same type of cut
is this like pink dress it just goes
really low in the front right there it's
super cute and flowy just crosses in the
back and the last thing I have to show
you is just this beautiful dress and I
know this is not everyone's style some
people think it's weird but I just saw
it and thought it was so she and I had
to try
different than all the dresses I have it
has this almost like I would just like a
turtleneck but it's loose it's like a
cow like almost but it's like high up so
cute all right the aren't rules cut
really low so it's just really unique
looking and it's like this big sweater
material and yeah that's all we have to
show you
maybe if I 5 these things I'll try to
link them down below that'll be really
helpful for you guys if you're
interested in these and you're always
looking it up it'll like save you time
thank you guys so so much for watching
and I'll see you my next video bye
hey everyone so today Lucy and I have a
huge haul it's not huge like every night
we had to have a dance party oh okay
Lucy and I just decided as a bonus you
can do it too if you want that at the
very end of our bucket list with a
little asterisk a little star is gonna
be have nightly dance parties because
that just sounds like a great idea it
will make us in a good mood before we go
to bed make us happy get our blood
pumping so that's gonna be our bonus one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
