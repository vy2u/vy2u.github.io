guys friends mmm
No hey everyone so today I'm just going
to be filming a Q&amp;amp;A video for you guys I
posted a picture on Instagram asking you
guys to comment all your questions so if
you're not following me on Instagram I
definitely do that because I'm obsessed
with Instagram I post like every single
day my username is just scratching
Garrety also you can add me on snapchat
because I post something all the time
and I love just like interacting with
you guys outside of YouTube as you guys
to ask some fun interesting questions so
some of these are gonna get a little
juicy favorite song right now I don't
know about right now but my favorite
song of all time is home by Edward
Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros what's
your majors and it's funny that you
phrase like that cuz I kind of have to
its Business Administration since I'm in
the question school business but I'm
concentrating in marketing and Finance
just Sawyer you're not alone video I
loved it other than that quilt was your
favorite go-to quote so if you haven't
seen that video if you don't know she's
talking about I'll link it down below
definitely go watch it so the quote
she's talking about is we were designed
with a purpose of for a purpose and I'm
so obsessed with that but other than
that quotes my go-to quote I would say
is just everything happens for a reason
that's really what I fall back on I'm
like every situation and I just have so
much faith in that how do you do a
fuckboys at college Oh Laura if any of
you know let us know what a way to treat
yourself so this kind of reminded me of
my friend Maggie you guys know about you
know here on YouTube I feel like we both
have the same like ideal day waking up
not too late going to yoga or like some
sort of workout maybe SoulCycle and then
maybe going out to brunch getting acai
bowls or smoothies or juice or whatever
coming back home showering getting ready
and I'm just having a day like maybe
going shopping I got to lunch whatever
just like hanging out with your
girlfriends watch a movie is getting
like pedicures manicures like stuff like
that it's just so fun do you interests
never talk anymore I guys friends mmm no
I wish him the best of luck in life and
I don't think there's any like ill will
between us but actually Hannah showed me
this the other day and it was like a
quote or like a post on Instagram
it's so weird how in today's day and age
you're kind of forced like you know
what's going on in other people's lives
I think social media kind of forces you
to keep all these relationships when
sometimes you don't need to keep them in
that's okay so that's a very roundabout
way of saying like we don't want to talk
anymore we're not really friends but I
think that's okay how is it not having
your twin with you this past semester
horrible Ally so sad I missed what was
one quality Lucy has that you wish you
had focus I'm really bad at staying
focused
okay Samara kills Sasha Ireland kings oh
my god this is so funny okay I feel like
definitely Mary Kang's you just like
gives me a loyal vibe obviously kiss
Ireland like duh oh and I guess kill
Sasha's sorry this intense when you look
foreign guys what would your perfect
buoyant bait if anyone knows me you know
I'm like literally psycho okay so I like
a very very specific type I don't know
if I should even say I don't like offend
anyone that's probably a lot of people's
tastes I don't know we all know I'm like
five nine that's quite tall and I enjoy
wearing heels so that puts me at about
six foot okay so my ideal guy is
definitely like six to and above has to
have dark hair guys with blond hair kind
of together me like I know I have
everybody I know I baby face I'm like in
shape but not too muscular like a good
balance
see this is so specific and then their
personality is also very specific you
have to have goals you have to be driven
I don't care what they are I don't care
what it's about like you have to be
passionate person because if you're not
that just kind of drives me insane and
it's like what are you doing like have a
purpose work towards something you know
what I mean yeah so moving on the worst
type of story by the way your videos
give me like all of you sweet pea this
is so weird to talk about but I just
love being open with you guys and became
just like relate I'm like horrible
experience isn't life so this is one of
them basically the day we met he said I
love you Gretchen it was going on like
get out of here so yeah that was
definitely not even the war it's just
like the weirdest I was like do you know
what you're saying anyway mrs. after you
graduate do you plan on staying in
Boston
I can live in New York City I will one
of the two but New York is just like
where I feel like myself and I'm
thriving out of all of your videos which
one do you cherish the most
hello not a specific one but like a John
raah I would say videos I make I
probably only made a couple like this
but the one that I just posted you are
not alone and then I know I posted one
about breaking with my ex-boyfriend and
like moving on and I feel like those
videos are just my most favorite because
I think I can really connect with you
guys I just didn't realize how relatable
so many of our experiences are and I
always thought that like I was alone
when I was like feeling these things
after like going through a breakup or
whatever so I love posting videos even
though they're probably the hardest to
film because I get like so emotional
they end up being my favorite videos
because I get so many sweet messages in
comments I like bring tears to my eyes
that I've helped so many of you so those
are definitely my favorite types of
videos and if you guys have any my great
video ideas or any like deep questions
you have for me that you think I could
make a video on that you would love to
hear like my perspective on definitely
leave them in a comment down below
because I love you know having real
talks with you guys where are you going
to travel to next and actually two weeks

how do you stay motivated to eat healthy
and work out any tips and tricks I
really feel like it's a change in your
mindset since I was eight do you want to
athlete my first year in college I
really thought it working out it's like
a chore and just something that I had to
go do six days a week for like three
hours and it kind of made me despise
we're hanging out for a while but now I
see working out is something that like I
choose to do and it's like really fun
and I feel good about it and I can do
ever I want would you ever consider
moving to the west coast's probably not
I really like visiting LA San Francisco
like California but I don't really think
