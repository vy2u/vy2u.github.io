to be my everyday makeup routine and I
know this is not an everyday a type of
look for everyone and honestly when I go
back to school I probably won't be
wearing this every day because it is a
lot but on days that I want to look
really nice
or jeiza I'm just like feeling it like
some days when I really just sit at home
I just said it's on because I personally
just love doing makeup kuchen loves
beauty I feel like for a while I wasn't
that into makeup again I would just wear
like mascara and powder in class
everyday but recently I've just been
getting back into makeup again and I
just have it so much fun at putting it
on and one of you are asking what makeup
I had in my morning routine video so
this is that look because I started be
filming to make a video kind of tutorial
for you guys
PS if you are new to my channel
definitely do not forget to subscribe
it's down below so you can be notified
when I post me videos and here you can
follow me on my social media I've been
really getting into Twitter recently -
look I really don't take that much for
tweeting is so fun actually so be sure
to follow me on Twitter if you don't
already everything I'm going to be
putting on my face in this video I'll
have link down below so it's easy for
you guys to find it say guys though I'm
still literally my PJs right now just
getting ready like no bra yeah anyway if
you want to see how to get this look it
just keep on watching so I start off
completely with a bare face and my skin
wasn't doing amazing at this point in
time I felt this way back in January so
before I started ecology if my skin got
a lot better just moisturize my skin
with some Cetaphil moisturizing as
Porefessional primer from benefit and
then I'm just using this Tarte
Foundation which does look so dark but I
promise guys it matches my body just my
face my neck like don't get tan like the
rest of my body
and then I use two different be blenders
I use my penguin just to make my
foundation like blend in even more and
really like get it in my skin and then I
use my black one for powder you'll see
that and then I'm just using the tar
under-eye and
concealers that would it's called and I
just used a really really light color
because I'm obsessed with like the
really light under I look and I'm just
using my Laura Mercier a translucent
powder to bake my face I'm really not a
pro at this I don't know what I'm doing
I just thought as much as I can
yeah see I really don't know what I'm
doing and I've never actually baked like
your cheeks before um but I just tried
it out for this video and yeah I really
just don't know what to do with that but
it's fine and then now I'm just filling
in my eyebrows with the honest eyes yeah
brow Wiz pencil yes I'm a shade soft
brown and I know eyebrows in the front
or the ends of my IRA so I have to draw
those puppies on but you know it looks a
lot better after you do that and then I
just use a little spoolie brush to make
them look a little bit more natural and
like blend it out I think this is so
funny that I kept my powder on my face
was long while I was taking my eyeshadow
but you know that's I think what Vicky's
or also the order of the makeup in this
video is very weird like it's very just
out of order and random I think cuz I
was filming I was just getting like
flustered and just doing random things
and random times so I'm using my naked
smoky palette I'm just using a bunch of
different colors in there I do like a
kind of darker shimmery I look like dark
on the outside and more like light on
the inside and then with a more taupe
crease and then like the light under my
brow bone and also I don't know if I'm
supposed to blend out baking my face
before I do my contour or after let me
know guys but I'm just using this like
NARS palette that has a bunch of
different bronzers and blushes that's
what I do I really bronze look
I'm just called my eyelashes I'm putting
on some Milani I think that's a brandy
at with liquid eyeliner it's so dark I
love this eyeliner it's like g2 and then
I feel like I've been wanted to show
this a while how would you might pick
eyelashes and these are just the kiss
every Z 11 lashes and I'll use them like
two or three times so they already have
some mascara on them but it's fine and
then I just use the black to lash glue
and then I put some more eyeliner on top
just to make sure it's all blends in you
can't like see the glue or anything and
people get so mad at me that I put like
eyeliner on the bottom like that but I
just think that it looks good I know
that's weird but I just always do that
with my good eyeliner and then I'm just
using this covergirl a mascara just to
blend my eyelashes into my fake
eyelashes more and then on the bottom I
put on some chapstick I'm using a Kylie
lip kit in Koko K it is my favorite
color and I'm ever wearing anything my
lips it is this and I just love the way
how it lasts like forever
now I'm doing highlighter and you're
probably Gretchen where's your blush and
you'll see I've done later because I
forgot about it so I'm just using it
this Becca highlighter it pushes on my
favorite part guys and I just forgot to
cut off so I just mixed together two
different shades in the North pallet and
yeah that is it final look guys I know
I'd like a lot of steps but this is just
how I like to do my makeup
so that was my everyday makeup routine
or just the makeup I've been doing
recently I really hope you guys enjoyed
and if you did don't forget to give this
video a big thumbs up thank you so much
for watching I'll see my next video bye
PS if you don't like this video for any
other reason like this video for the
fact that I coffee lighting yeah I've
never had professional lighting I just
got a ring like so exciting and a lot of
you already have been commenting that my
editing has gotten better because I did
get Final Cut Pro and I'll probably talk
about it another video by finally got
Final Cut as you can probably tell by
the way this video is edited but super
exciting and I'm ready and knocking off
one of my new year's resolutions to
improve the quality of my videos so yeah
