soft of the logo word ah yummy so and it
says honey what I really like and I
think like sassy so I was very soft like
an egg right and it's like cropped and I
just think it's like body nation and
then this is a little set that we like
it's just like a very cute and like so
also this is really fitting to a be here
because whenever I get close I'm like oh
sorry favorite shirt can I have you

yes this is the top I really like the
material that's just cool like different
yeah it's like fun it is fun it's like
light you know like like I don't wait
I'm gonna go like this so you couldn't
see the material yeah it's like light
and like stretchy and like like cool
like Rim looking but like not like a
normal room I don't know you just gotta
get it marry yourself so you can try
like a little spring - I would wear it
yeah and this spring with sunglasses my
hand a bun and like maybe like sneakers
yeah go get a smoothie and you're like
running errands that's exactly what I
was very that's actually a really good
idea it's like a zippy upbeat I like it
short
thanks Lou or Bronwyn yes love and then
yeah that I got for Lucy and then this
ribbed penis net or just the top yeah it
goes with this skirt this is also baddie
nation I feel I'm gonna hold and Hannah
was like I want to borrow that toy the
pansy it's like this thing that they
have AVM and it's like this light pink
oh I like that there's like a stretchy
band to it so I don't like fit you and I
won't be like too tight or too loose
really really cute and it's like and
it's like thick so it's not gonna be
see-through because don't worry cuz it's
like a light color but it won't be
see-through and then the top just goes
with and then this is like really bad II

like sports bra thing goes with these
here's our fun little my game and this
just says I mean I always call it
honeybunch

honey bunch but its honey bum and it's
just black this is honey bottle on the
bottom oh sorry

Megan in there yeah so rude and then

flattering to like I wouldn't think that
this little stretchy vibe goes with this
top and we don't want to wear this
tonight
totally I'm gonna wear this to dinner
with my Oliver in this I'm gonna wear
this to Easter break but this is so fun
and this guys this is like I would say
this is a dupe for Lucy's I am gia said
that she got that she wore our 21st
birthday it looks exactly like this but
the bottoms are packed I said is that
the same thing she I have we even
confused the two so if you want to get
like a more affordable one you want a
big Lucy Garrity get that yeah of course
I'm saying your body just I didn't even
get one in this home but I love their
body suits and then we got this red
simple dress I'm gonna why is the camera
battery dying might so rude but it's
just as red Trat so like skinny strop
super stretchy and comfy and warm enough
because I'm hi Jalil took us a lot of
dresses don't cover my diet is out of
her pad

somewhat taller than her but I made it
work anyway guys if you wanted to wear
this without a bra I mean I just spit
again and I just broke up my now that
her so some fun having a guest star

saying if you really wanted to wear it
without a bra like you do you like where

paper so it may be stored under I
thought that was in my mind but um yeah
