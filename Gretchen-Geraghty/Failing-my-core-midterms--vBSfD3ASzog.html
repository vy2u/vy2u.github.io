know over at like 6:15 which is so
unlike me good morning guys so I just
ran some and I got some bagels because
my parents are having some like family
members over I don't even know describe
it it's like my mom's second cousins so
I don't know that makes them to me or is
it to her actual cousins
maybe it's my second cousins or first
cousins once removed I don't know how it
works I don't know I also got some ice
that was fun
so yeah happy Sunday everybody Teddy
wants bread so my mom and me it just
went to the post office Teddy it came to
join me but I'm about to go on a run
actually I actually bought new
headphones yesterday when I went into
the mall with Julia for a sec I got the
ones with like the lightning cable at
the end and can you guys comment down
below and let me know like oh yeah I put
on wanna make a brother too can you let
me know well looks like I'm wearing so
much blush why I swear it's not that
much of me why it's basically I lost
these headphones with like the lightning
cable to go with my iPhone 7 plus cuz I
can't use any my other normal headphones
like the normal Jack I looked on Amazon
immediately if there's any headphones
with like the lightning cable adapter
but there wasn't any and I'm like is
actually out is like I just have to go
buy the Apple one so I just bought these
at the Apple store there are 30 bucks so
much this is so dumb needle for a run
and then I'll come back to meet it with
my family and I told them my hospital
for a run we're also I will not be
hungry again for dinner because I'm so
full from like eating so much man okay
guys so back from my run it was really
good and while I was gone I had my dad
play with my new speaker so I want to
show you guys it's called fabric you
thought it was Fabrique
okay I wanted to come sit and chat with
you about it while Teddy balls me
because if you sit on the ground he gets
really excited runs and I'm just gonna
play the last time I was running to on
my speaker's called new rules by duo
Lipa have you heard this song before dad
so it turnings on it sounds like that
and then you click the little Bluetooth
button so then it connects to your phone
yeah it worked ok so now you just click
play on your phone I'm playing on
Spotify yay oh yeah my dad taught me
look at that you can't hear me if you
click this little button yeah the top
one it changes the colors of the lights
I think it goes with the beat of the
song don't go and then it's just blue
which is like normal over here sorry I'm
also D for my run but hey what I wanted
to tell you guys about this is I just
found mail and I'm super excited because
having like a Bluetooth speaker is
obviously really nice to just hook up
with your phone but also in college is
like so nice and then me put on my
roommates like oh you listen to music
together in the morning when we're all
getting ready so this is me it's so
awesome and I'm definitely gonna make
them get one of these too because these
fabrics speakers hook up with each other
they like all sync together so we can
put them like in our different rooms
around our apartment and then they'll
all sync up and play the same song which
is like super cool so I just got this
grey and yellow and white one cuz I was
like you so I'll have a fabric link down
below in case you guys are interested
