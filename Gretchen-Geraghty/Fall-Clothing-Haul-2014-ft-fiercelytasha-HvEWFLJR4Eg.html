video and you probably just watched part
one I miss hall which was on Tasha's
channel fiercely Tasha freak those of
you that don't know her and yeah this is
just part to my shopping that we did
today at the mall and for those of you
that we met at the meetup it was so much
fun like thank you for coming up to us
and Dean pictures you love meeting you
guys we just have some stuff from pax on
Francesca's and Urban Outfitters and
let's just get into it first I'll just
show you some stuff that I ordered from
Urban Outfitters and it like just came
recently got this layered necklace
because I like really wanted to layer
necklace there's a go little circle
that's like shorter and then like a long
one as well really simple I got all
these earrings that are just there's
like little silver ones turquoise ones
others like triangles cool little stuff
so cute I want that yeah I usually just
wear like studs okay don't worry look
big dangly ones although I do somebody
like imperfection so I'm not wearing
them now and it's really gross so then I
just had these little studs I got three
rappers because I've been going around
for crazy then one of them is what I'm
wearing right now I need it in my line
if I want Tasha to get sweet give me
twins
it's like cream and athletes right here
and took off the shoulder and I got two
other ones processed with them because
they like little pom-poms at the bottom
the first one is kind of I thought it
was like for scream but it's really more
of like a chain I don't even know what
color it is I still don't know what
color it is really it's like you mix the
teal and a florist be like kinda like
teal
it's like short sleeve and it has almost
at the bottom and I like fences they
like tie in the back at the top
obviously you need it in back too so we
just got the black one
I'll just start up a pack sign and I
just caught this long-sleeve black
t-shirt and it's not crops I've cropped
one but it's long and it has like this
scoop neckline and I like it because
it's like really low in the back and
like how do you mean is just really
tight and it's like a variance to
everything yeah it's a basic and then I
got the sweater that I've been seeing
like variations of it like everywhere
and I'm really happy I got it it's
another clean sweater surprise fries but
at least at the bottom which i think is
so you later I'm not what kind of lawyer
from forever 21 and I so I got this
shirt from packs item it's really Cobb
which is kind of sad like they don't
even make normal length shirts anymore
like they're always crap but it's a
really pretty like a floral pattern it's
off the shoulder and I don't know I feel
like maybe if I try to find high-waisted
pants I can do this so only those
planted jeans yours cut yeah I heard I
always wear jeans so I like figure
something out but this is so huge so and
like I've wanted a shirt from Mooga
it's like RVCA but you pronounce it
regretfully come on retirement yeah it's
ruga and like I've wanted one literally
it's like two years and I love maroon
it's kind of maybe not but I also love
faithful style like t-shirt and so this
one just has we've got it yeah and like
oh my god this is gonna be so great with
just like leggings and like converse or
like vans or something it's it's a great
thing so also when we were shopping in
town yesterday I got this from a little
boutique what was even called I don't
know but I really wanted like a crystal
statement necklace for a while and it's
just this thing that crystal one it's
kind of like fancy but I'll figure out
how to like dress it down maybe with
like a t-shirt dress or something and in
the last place II went to sprint
Cheska's not sure what the statement
necklace crazy yeah I'm I'm telling her
she has to wear them all oh yeah she I'm
gonna be weird if I don't even just to
check up make sure I'm wearing that I
told myself I really
state your necklaces made really rough
ease up Francesca's has really good
stamp necklaces except they're kind of
expensive so if you go there when they
like half off that's what yeah
buy one get one half off you got to do
that the first one I got is this patil
and like magenta like me yeah I will say
jente it is magenta it's like teal and
magenta and it's just this pretty like
kind of flower statement necklace we
can't even know if it's Robert yeah I
just got this statement necklace this is
the reason of my wanting necklaces from
there it's just this like hair even
called back periwinkle is a pretty high
color love pairing it's like this
periwinkle statement that good and
they're kind of like circling triangles
triangle set up that's how they go and
it's just very Winkle and I needed to go
so adorable if I saw this Jessi
Francesca's like back home and I needed
it in my life but there was only a long
edge and I am like a midget so that
wasn't gonna happen especially this
Francesca's dresses are so long okay so
I saw this one and then crunch it's like
oh my god get to clean and we don't go
to the same school so we can totally buy
the same sign now it's awesome perfect
33 count they're like Paisley right and
then they have like something dazzling
like I don't even know what are these
like beads like oh yeah like your jewels
on the side I'm not really chill with
they're like bees yeah and it's like a
shift dress so it's really comfortable
and it's a lot longer than means it is
I'm Gretchen yeah actually I both get
smalls and it's like wait if it's
