days in Boston so I guess I will just
show you some of the things I got so
with the first place I went to his
Lululemon and I'm literally obsessed
with Lululemon their workout stuff is
like literally so cute and I just love
it and also I don't know if you guys
want prices so I actually just tweeted
out do you guys look gonna include
prices or not so I might include prices
like down here and I also char it on a
bunch of the things so I hope you like
when I do that too so the first thing I
got is just this white tank top it's
just like a workout getting top it's
like kind of tight I like stretchy and
the back is just crossed like that it's
like I think it's called like the white
tank toppers and things that looks kind
of like a why and I just really pissed
too because it has like a built in bras
but you don't even have to worry about
that and it is really good for like yoga
because I'm obsessed with yoga and like
running and working out too got this
like maroon tank top weight I just
thought was so cute because it's maroon
and I love maroon it has like these long
tags that I just rip right off because
they're annoying get in the way and this
one's kinda like a racerback tank top
but it has like thin straps they're both
like really tight but I like
form-fitting stuff when I workout so
it's not like swishing around it just
kind of like stays weren't supposed to
you and I last thing I got from
Lululemon was just this headband and
it's like purple and white thin stripes
I don't know wait here alright so it's
just like kind of purple or red and
white really thin stripes I guess I was
like sticky stuff so it will like save
your hair you know what I mean when
you're like working out oh also I don't
know if you guys noticed I got this
little outfit necklace Justin got it for
me for our one-year anniversary and it
literally is good luck I kid you not
like it I think it's called like good
luck
I know they saw it like Nordstrom I like
a link that down below but just look how
freaking cute it is it is so cute it's a
little elephant I'm just obsessed
so yeah that's not really part of this
haul and kind of off topic but that's
that and then the next place I went to
is brandy melville surprise fries I'm
so weird I got like a sign a Boston
store had like a lot of signs so I just
got this sign it says brandy melville
that's where I'm gonna put it my room it
just goes like perfectly on top of my
like closet doors it's just gonna like
rest off along the top and I just
thought it was really cute so I got this
wooden brandy melville sign you know I
do not like they're bad they're just
like these big paper bags in which they
were like pretty ones that had like
pretty designs on them I don't know for
any mom we'll fix your bags
so the first clothing thing I got was
just this green sweater it's like dark
forest green and it's really big and
comfortable and like loose-fitting and
has like a little v-neck and I have to
like roll up the sleeves cuz it's really
long but yeah it's like so comfortable
and will go with so much like into the
winter with like scarves and believe it
or not I like don't have a plain white
v-neck and they had one so I just got
this white plain white v-neck and it's
like really soft and stretchy and I like
love too easily soft material clothes
buy them because they're like really
comfortable and the next thing I got is
actually this t-shirt that I'm wearing
right now is just like a blue and white
navy stripe t-shirt and I look obsessed
with stripes it's like a really bad like
habit of mine I will just always buy
striped things so just to add to the
stripe collection well I think I got
from brandy melville was just this
forest green like crop tank top and you
might you say Gretchen why are you
buying cropped clothing it's fall and
basically what you're seeing is it's
November I know but I actually going to
the Bahamas in like 11 days so I can
wear this there with some like nice
high-waisted shorts and stuff and if it
also work with like high-waisted pants
and like layer scarves and sweaters with
it like in the fall like I really have
been liking this color a lot last place
I went to is Urban Outfitters the first
necklace I got is just this really long
actually silver like pendant and it's
just like a circle like the little
designs I think it'll just go with a lot
you can just throw it on it'll make your
outfit look a little more fancy the next
necklace I got it's just like this short
little gold like rectangle bar necklace
and it'll look really good like layering
necklaces too last thing I got are just
these little gloves and they're like
gray knit gloves from Urban Outfitters
and they're literally the most
comfortable as soft things ever look at
the inside see they're all furry like
they keep hearing and so warm and I wore
them in the city when it was like really
cold so yeah these are gonna be really
good for the winter to like keep me nice
and warm so yeah that is everything I
got and I know it was like pretty short
