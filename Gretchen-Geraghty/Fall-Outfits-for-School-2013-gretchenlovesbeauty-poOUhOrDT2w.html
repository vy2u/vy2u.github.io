is I was talking over my friends because
that's what we do we just talk over each
other like and she took out the parts
where people are being like irrelevant
or swearing's yeah like some of the
stuff maybe like I'm sorry if I talk
over my friends about what makes you mad
but like we all talk over each other
like I doubt someone farts well but it's
like literally all five of us would be
talking at once and yeah like we'd be
like talking over each other that's just
how it is like I'm sorry it's just how I
am with my friends look I'm not trying
to be rude at all we just are like
obnoxious and stuff um but yeah this is
