februari favorites and I know I haven't
done a favorites video in a long time
but it was requested a few times that I
do favorites videos so I thought I would
just do on a favorites video for this
month and this is so weird like me
sitting here talking to the camera
because i feel like i haven't actually
like sat down to talk to the camera you
know what i mean like those kind of
videos for a really long time ah so yeah
that's just like kind of weird and the
cameras at a weird angle like it's like
looking down at me so sorry if that
bothers do um look a time where I wore
top eyeliner for the first time today
ever and it was literally so weird like
I feel weird like it doesn't go long
there we don't I look different can't
comment if you liked this island or not
cuz it's kind of driving me insane I
don't know like I can't tell if I like
it it just feels like too much for me
you know and I mean I don't know it's a
lot but anyway getting back on topic so
first I'll share with you just a brush
that I use every day if it's for
foundation BB cream whatever I always
use this brush and this is the Sigma
round kabuki brush and i love it so much
because it's really like um what's it
called dense and like soft and like if
you have these brushes you know what I
mean they're like oh I don't know really
nice and they put on your foundation or
BB cream really well and I like it a lot
and it like blends it into your skin
really nice so yeah I feel like everyone
talks about these so yeah I just really
like it so if I do wear a foundation
which I haven't really been wearing
foundation that much because um some of
you may know I went to Mexico the week
ago I miss it so much I was there for a
week and my skin got really tan so I'm
using the foundation that I got in the
summer tease in the summer and it
matches me perfectly and I am wearing it
today I just
you wearing it um because I just felt
like one foundation but my skin has
gotten somewhat wider like at the
beginning of the week I was a literally
just wearing max mineralize skinfinish
natural and I face looked fine because
they cleared up so much from the Sun
there and so yeah so I was really happy
about that but getting off track again
and this is just the foundation I use if
I do in wear foundation like a day like
today I just felt like it and it's I'm
pretty dark because my son foundation
and this is the Tarte Amazonian clay
12-hour full coverage foundation and I'm
sure some of you have heard of this um
yeah I just really like it a lot and I
like it because it's full coverage and I
wear foundation I'm not going to get
like a light or medium medium a B
coverage foundation oh because I just
feel like I want to our foundation when
I want my face to look all one color and
like flawless so I always go for like
the media more like I high coverage
foundation do you know what I'm saying
so yeah I really like this stuff and it
really nice and my skin gets really oily
I've noticed with different face
products and this doesn't make my skin
too oily so yeah this is good stuff I
really like it and then um this is new
you haven't heard me talk about it i'm
pretty sure but i've used this
throughout the whole month look I'm
obsessed with this stuff I really wanted
to try like BB cream for a long time
because I know it's like better for your
skin and there's like good stuff in it
to make your skin better but also I was
like some coverage and i was like i
really did my research on these BB
creams and i found the dr jart beauty
balm this is the one for like aging skin
I know that's kind of weird like you
wouldn't think I need that because I'm
only 15 but uh I don't know I just
really like this one I feel like it has
more brightening components for your
skin
I mean because it's like for aging skin
even skin tone and minimizes the
appearance of imperfections um infused
with a serum of advanced brightening and
anti-aging properties to firm and
hydrates oh yeah I don't know this one
just looks too out to me and I really
like to even though i don't really have
to worry about aging skin but i really
like this one a lot more than the
original one i'm pretty sure so yeah I
just recommend this one and its really
nice like it actually does have like a
fair amount of coverage like it's pretty
good like if your skin is pretty good on
its own with maybe like a few pimples or
something you can just get away with
this because I think it's really nice me
yeah and i think i just feel like when i
take it off my skin still feels really
nice not like i've been writing like a
full face of makeup like this feels good
on your skin so this next thing is the
two-faced bronzer and the original
chocolate soleil one and i talk about
this like ever since i started youtube
it was like one of the first bronzers i
ever got and i got it at sephora and i
like i love it so much I fool I was like
young back in the day I just wanted it
because it smells like chocolate you
know cuz there's cocoa in it ooh Samir
it's kind of like I don't know if anyone
else is like that but it kind of merely
flops around um but it smells so good
and i love it and i'm the reason I like
this a lot this month is because it's a
really really really dark bronzer and
I've had some people are scared of it
because it's so dark um but you really
can't like blend it out what guy i have
used to perform and i'm really light too
because i know you can blend it out but
I've really been using it a lot recently
because i got i dot so tan in Mexico so
I can use it more because it's drunker
so it's still like a bronzer
you know because some of my other later
bronzers are like not even bronzers on
me anymore because I'm so tan uh but
yeah I would like completely one hundred
percent recommend this bronzer because
it's so nice and I love it and it's not
like orange or anything it's like being
tabulous okay this next thing is the
Urban Decay all nighter long-lasting
makeup setting spray and I really like
this because I just use it like set on
my wake up and I feel like it keeps my
makeup on my girl again i noticed when i
use it that my makeup looks better at
the end of the day because sometimes
your foundation looks kind of like
splotchy like it kind of came off and
stuff but this keeps it on like today i
noticed my foundation is so pretty good
at the end of the day um so i really do
think it makes a difference and i have
like the xl1 so this is like bigger than
the normal one like isn't even that big
but um yeah i highly recommend this
stuff and yeah it's really nice to keeps
you make if I mother so it's good but I
mean it's not like a necessary if you
don't need to go buy cuz it's kind of
expensive but yeah it's been a favor I
really do like it and now this is
another brush for your face this is the
Sigma large powder f30 brush and it's
like really fluffy it's like just like
one of their biggest ones out and I was
just huge and I like this for um powder
obviously oh and i always use the
mineralized skin finish natural case you
were wondering but i really like this
for that and i use it sometimes for
bronzer too because if i'm lazy it like
like honestly most of the month I just
um take this and go like that and like
put out my face because i'm too lazy to
just get another Russian I don't know it
just kind of like blends it all that
nice and I like out so big so you don't
have to like take a little one and take
longer you literally just go like boom
done any makeup so um yeah I really like
this this month and its really soft and
nice and yeah and this I think is new to
i haven't mentioned this is the tarte
amazonian clay 12-hour blush wow I feel
good talk
a lot of torque things wait tell me to
you know what I mean um and this is just
the Amazonian clay 12-hour blush and I
like it a lot I warned a lot this month
it's kind of like a pinky it's showing
it really pink on camera but it's more
of like a coral color and this is just
like a mini one that I got an a set some
other ones but yeah it's not the full
size 10 but I really like it a lot and
I've noticed that it stays on all day
because blushy so hard like blush always
wears off but I'm wearing today and it
pretty look you can tell on camera
either but it stayed on like all day and
I really really like this color I like I
kind of I'm peachy Cora blushes on my
skin tone more than like hot pink ones
so yeah stuff is pretty great ok just a
few more things for my eyes I've used
this for such a long time actually not
such a long time what am I talking about
but you know like I like this for a
while and this is max black track fluids
align and pretty sure and it's just like
a black gel eyeliner I'll show you mine
it's kind of gross you know like just
eyeliner and then um the brush I use of
it well holding it and this is the Sigma
small angle e65 brush and it's just like
a little brush you know angle brush that
you put on your eyeliner with it's easy
it's kind of gross and dirty but what it
was and I've always used this to like
put blog eyeliner on my waterline cuz I
always used to tight line my eyes but
then today I just decided I would try a
letter on the top once again I really
don't know how I feel about it but um
yeah like if I ever wear eyeliner I
always use these two things so they're
definitely a favorite because I like to
wear eyeliner oh my other mascara that I
wanted to show you is in my sister's
backpack because you stole it oopsie but
um mascara been wearing every day I'm
like obsessed with how it looks now
because my eyelashes are
the short and stubby but I found two
mascaras that I think look good and work
good she's even though they're so short
and so first I use Oh buck Soames lash
mascara mascara i'm pretty sure it's
just the original one I don't really
know the name sorry to my sisters bag
but on it's black and it just his buxom
on the outside and I always put that on
first and I feel like that by itself
doesn't do that much it kind of just
separates my eyelashes and puts on some
mascara but it doesn't have any like
volume and um the L'Oreal telescopic
carbon black is what I'm holding and
this I always put on top of the buxom
mascara because here I'll show you the
brush it's like really thin and you
wouldn't think that it does that much
but it seriously is like this brush is
like fantastic I don't know it's really
good at like volumizing your lashes like
adding volume and it makes some longer
too um when I first got this it was
actually funny because I like started
wearing it and I hated it like on its
own I don't know about anyone else but
it calms my another ship together so bad
but then right as I realized I can work
with it by putting it on top of another
mascara I love it a lot and I know a lot
of other people like this like I got it
the idea from base Kelly Marie 16
because I love her videos and I saw that
she loved this so I tried it out and I
really do love it so i totally recommend
that mascara because you know it's just
awesome um and also because I was in
Mexico and because it's winter my lips
would just get really dry and I actually
stole this from my sisters but this is
the user and aqua for lip repair and I
don't know if that many people know
about this it's just like a I would say
like chapstick but obviously thought I'm
chapstick it comes out of a squeezy tube
but it's really like moisturizing like
it's almost like Vaseline that comes in
a tube you know like petroleum jelly but
if look at other stuff in it and this
really like heals your lips like this is
like a miracle like my lips will be dry
and discussing and then I put this on at
night I'm like I priority put pretty
much put this on every night and I wake
up and I lips are really nice so this
stuff does a great job at like um
nourishing your lips and making them
like not to try you know what I mean so
yeah I really like this stuff pinterest
so the last thing is only a little bit
beauty related but it is the such a beat
and dry fast top coat and I got this for
Christmas in our a little bit so much
it's just a top copra when you paint
your nails do you see how much I've use
like pretty much half way well me and my
sister is both like used it because I
pretty much beat my nails and like as
much as i canna believe probably like I
don't know how two or three times and of
course right now ironically my nails are
like disgusting and chipping but um yeah
I always put this on top of my nail
polish can you literally don't
understand how great this is like it
dries your nail polish in like 30
seconds like I put it on and then I go
till do something and my nails hit
something and they were like already dry
so this stuff is like great and it makes
him really shiny and nice um yeah it's
like fantastic the only thing I would
say is that I kind of burned through it
quickly and it kind of smells funny like
a dozen spine normal nail polish it
smells like look really chemically maybe
but this stuff is like fantastic and it
keeps your nail polish on for a while
this nail polish has been on for a week
and it's on pretty good like it's solely
kind of chipping gross but like it's
been on for a while um so yeah that
concludes my febuary favorites and um i
guess if you liked your thumbs up this
video and leave me a nice little comment

do more of the videos that you requested
