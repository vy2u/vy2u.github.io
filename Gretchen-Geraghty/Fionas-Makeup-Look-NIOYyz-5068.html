do a natural makeup look on Fiona just
taking black out from the Urban Decay
Naked 2 palette pretty subtle looking
and we're just gonna put that all over
our eyelids this is just gonna create
some definition while looking pretty
natural you probably wear at school out
anywhere like it's just black dark dark
black shade over for winter
now that we're looking nice and natural
beautified we're just going to find a
little bit more with flats underneath
now that you're looking nice and natural
ready for school we're gonna move on
with the rest of the makeup look
now do through your eyes look what do
you think good we're going for that
natural eye makeup don't forget natural
is the key word
all right now that you're clean nice and
beautified you got to add some more
makeup well just to warm up her face a
little bit ready for that whatever
school look we're gonna take this really
light brown Too Faced bronzer and dark
chocolate Soleil and it's just a really
nice light brown and I'm going to pull
all about our cheekbones and so you're
just going to take a brush like this see
only a little that is and make a fishy
face and then show me where to go dark
again just a little bit just like that
natural as ever
and if you want some on your cheek I
mean on your forehead that is
okay now she needs some blush but we're
not gonna go with some crazy hot pink
color we're just gonna go with this
light natural shade with Angelica from
NARS a slight pink color right there I'm
only going to use a little little bit Oh
again just a little not too much
yeah like that to finish off the look
what's next what do you think's next
good girl now for the lips we're not
just gonna go with that the usually the
like light pinks and stuff that's too
much for us so we're just gonna go with
this really nice natural-looking brown
color um it'll go I don't look at it
like matches her lips already so we're
just gonna use a little bit of that and
it'll go right with her lips blend right
in looks like she's not wearing any
makeup whatsoever he's gonna just make
her let's move that little shape may be
easy for application
I think she's just ready to go to school
like what do you think like everyday
love yeah totally I think she's ready to
go anywhere anytime doesn't even look
like she's wearing any makeup this is
perfect for just looking everyday
situation whatever as you can see what
do you think natural-looking yeah I say
yes til next time okay we're gonna have
to like take this off perfect</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
