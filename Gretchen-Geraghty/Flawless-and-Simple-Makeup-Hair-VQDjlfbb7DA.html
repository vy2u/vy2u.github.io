flawless and simple hair and makeup so
I'm going to be using the balletto
Studios airbrush system for makeup and
it comes with a whole bunch of different
foundation shades but i'm just using the
shade latte sorry there's like weird
light on my face right there from the
window but yeah i'm just using the shade
a latte and you just gotta be careful
with this because you don't want to hold
it too close to your face you want to
hold it like six inches away for
foundation and i just do like five or
six drops into the airbrush you can keep
using the airbrush to have as much
coverage or as little coverage as you
want you just want to go in even
circular motions I did like two
different applications at the foundation
to get the coverage that I wanted you
also want to make sure that you blend it
down your neck so you don't have a funny
mask and yeah you just got to stick with
it until the coverage you want and now
i'm using this light pink color for some
blush and you hold it a little bit
closer to your face to have it just a
little more concentrated on the one area
of your face to do a blush and now i'm
actually using a lighter shade of
foundation just to highlight and kind of
put under my eyes and i also put it down
on the middle of my forehead and on my
nose to highlight so i really like the
way that came out and you can get the
ultimate airbrush system for only at $59
if you use the code loves beauty on
paletas website i'll have it linked down
below now for I might go I'm just doing
some simple eyeliner with this black
eyeliner pen so too
bye
you guys know I love doing my eyeliner
like this I just make a thin line on the
top and drag it on the bottom and I'm
curling my eyelashes and I find that
crying my eyes she's like the most
helpful for me because I have really
short eyelashes and inner Tooting the
black mascara you can get all of this
off their website too i'll have it
linked down below I'm just shooting this
black mascara to it define my eyelashes
so curling them definitely helps a lot
and that is actually all for my makeup
look it's so simple but it's very
flawless looking I love the way the
airbrush system it makes my face look
now I'm just brushing at my hair because
I'm going to be curling it I'm using new
Lee's octa wand set it actually just
comes with eight different ones and
they're interchangeable barrels that you
can put in the curling iron and I like
it because you can have loose waves and
you can also have defined curls and it
actually heats up to 410 degrees
Fahrenheit which is so so hot so it
actually holds the curls which is so
nice and I find that my hair is hard to
hold a curl in but the nume wand always
works so well so i'm using the biggest
wand just to make these curls and i like
to do it big and loose i just take
really big sections and just wrap it
around like that so it's very loose
looking and I just like how simple it
looks so just go around my whole head
like this as you can see until all my
hair is curled and I'm using this new me
argan oil which makes it my hair really
soft and shiny and if you use the code
love Gretchen on newbies website link
down below it will give you one hundred
dollars off of all their sets so that's
it thanks for watching and I'll see my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
