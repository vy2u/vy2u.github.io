forever 21 and Hollister I wanted to
show you basically everything that I got
so here we go so first from forever 21 I
got this mint cardigan it's a small and
I believe it was it might have been like
13 $15 I already took the tag off
business I don't know and it's really
cute because it has cute little bows on
the pocket so that's why I really like
this and I really I'm not looking with
quarterman especially that spring you're
getting closer so I really like this
mint color so that's one and then this
is like almost the same it's another
minute sweater and it's also too small
but it's almost like 1980 I believe and
it's one of those ones like the high-low
um hemline so it's really like
fashionable and if it a pullover sweater
and it's long sleeves and it's just
another mid sweater and it's really nice
I really like these and then next one
forever 21 I really like this blue dress
it's just small and I think it was like
20 to 80 and it's like just like a royal
blue it's really really pretty handsome
ruffles it has a zipper down the side
and then from forever 21 I got this
peach shirt it was 11 18 but it was 50%
off they're running a sale so it's just
like a peach shirt and I got it I got
any small and it was so as one man like
five or six months cuz there's one sale
and it just looks like that it's a
really pretty peachy orange color and
I'm really gonna like that for spring so
I also got the taupe colored shirt I'm
actually right now it's one of them it
goes to like your elbow and it's just
like this baggy sure it's really loose I
like it a lot I wanted to make taupe
colored and I really lose on that 880 so
I took a really good deals really cheap
next week over 21 I got another main
thing it is a mint
dress and it's like a body con a really
tight one it looks like this it's really
tight and it has legs look over it
he's really pretty and this woman was
1382 small and rather than looking miss
so then also from over 21 I got this
it's like a light brown it says it's
like a crop tank topping and it's all
ladies
this was 880 I just like I don't really
know
oh I'm my friend Patong he was ugly and
they did like it but anyways I just I
mean it's different I can work it look
good okay and then so when we got into
Hollister I my friend actually wanted
this but I thought it was really cute
it's just this white bathing suit top
with like ruffles down the front and
yeah oh this one it's usually 2480
but they had a sale where the whole
soros at 40% off so I think I got it I
got it from 1450 because of the sale and
it was clean right it'll go with a lot
of on different colored bottom so it's I
like that and then also from Hofstra I
got this navy blue sweater which was
marked down if 3990 and it's a small but
they also had the 40% off so it wasn't
thirty nine ninety it was cheaper it was
whatever for yourself or that is not
latina and it's just this knit sweater
it's like pretty loose and it may be
blue and I don't have any blue sweater
with this so I just have to get that
then well you can never have too many
jeggings so I got these jeggings like
this they may be blue they're actually
just like ones I'm wearing right now
from Abercrombie and they're just
showing our gosh on James even going a
lot of different color tops so so I got
that and then I got two dresses I just
fell in love with this style
this one's navy blue on top with navy
blue and white stripes with a bow and
it's an extra small and it's 5950 we
just like 60 bucks that's pretty
expensive
but again I got this on sale so it
wasn't 5952 is cheaper and then I got it
took a pinkish reddish and white striped
seam on style addressed it like this
like tire on it for a bow and this one's
also mm extra small and it was also 5950
so I mean I feel it I my temperature
none of these because there was this
young child address but I really like
both of them so comment down below which
one you like better which or anything
looks better on me because I'm gonna put
in pictures of me wearing them at the
end of this video so that's it for my
haul and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
