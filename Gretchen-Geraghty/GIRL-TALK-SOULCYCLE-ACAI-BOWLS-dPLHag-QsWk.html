SoulCycle right now I'm so excited I
cannot wait to go
it's feeling kind of like sick this
morning my stomach hurt but just staying
active like really helps me feel better
when I don't feel that good and I got my
period I know that's where you say yeah
I just feel better if I like get me
sweat in my arm steaming up the windows
I'm so hard sorry
have you ever been this whole cycle
before no that's where I just came from
it's like a workout spin class it's so
fun no I'm just making my AuSable
sometimes I'll go to like juice press
after Seoul but I like making them the
best because then I just feel like
frozen banana frozen fruit like granola
peanut butter coconut on top and it's
just like so good look at my final
product acai bowl I'm playing walking on
sunshine because that's just that's also
gets me in so then so guys as you can
tell it's a little bit while later I
just don't really exciting a package in
the mail guys look at how big it is
always love it stretching once I get
back from soul cycle or like any workout
look at the gym because usually I'll
stretch a bit at the gym and look at
soul cycle they have the stretch at the
end of the class you know but I like
stretching a lot more I'm like quite
flexible and I like staying that way
whenever I have a spare second I like
stretch in my apartment okay
oh we see my videos we're all friends
here and I know I mentioned earlier
actually when I was on my way to
SoulCycle like I usually feel pretty
like groggy when I have my period
probably you guys do too when you're on
your period and I mean I know 90% of you
watching this video probably more or
girls anyway so yeah these puppies apply
it to all of you and I don't know what
tampons you guys use but I've always
just used the Tampax pearl tampon and
literally it's so funny because I was
getting so many emails from like
different tampon companies that I was
like you know it doesn't really make
sense for me to do the video on them
talk about them because I don't use
those ones but I've always wanted to
talk about periods with you guys because
I remember when I / started my period
like I would have loved to have a big
sister to look up to and get some advice
and I know I have some younger viewers
out there so I hope that this is helpful
for you guys
as we shout to me thank you so much
Tampax for sponsoring this video I was
so excited because I was like those are
literally the tampons I've always used
since like day one you know I mean and
yeah they're just the Tampax pearl
active ones and I think the boxes took a
fun new a design growing up you guys
know I played like a million different
sports I did basketball I swam
volleyball rowing and you guys know my
freshman year at bu - I was on the
women's team on lightweight rowing team
at bu and I've just never strayed from
these puppies I think just the fit of
Tampax has always worked for me and
there's other types of tampons that I've
tried they kind of like hurt me just
don't kind of work as well with my body
and like these I'm so active in them and
you don't even notice they're there
they're just like the best workout ready
tampons in my opinion I know they're
made for like motion they like motion
fit protection because they know that
you're gonna be working out when you
wear these ones I also know that these
are available and a bunch of different
like absorbency levels like a bunch of
different types is that what their cost
it's like towards the end my period
sometimes I'll just grab the light ones
because I won't even need regular
because the skinnier light ones will be
enough to keep me covered
they have like regular super super plus
and ultra so yeah that's just my quick
talk about tampons and if you guys want
me to talk about it in like another
video I'm so open to doing that like I
don't even really mind y'all because
like I say all the time we're all
friends here like it literally affects
half of the population they pick we're
all sisters all buddies here just
talking hang it out and I mean I talk
about periods of my friends like all the
time you know it's just like a part of
life and yeah I would just recommend
these ones because they've always been
my favorite I also got this little water
bottle it's so what pretty it's this
really pretty blue color and it feels
like it's those one of those metal like
insulated one so this will be so good
when I'm working out I love bringing
these when I work out so that your water
stays nice and cold and then I got this
women's hair band I especially love
wearing headbands when i'm running or
when i'm biking because that's when i
find i sweat the most especially if i go
on long runs like there's like sweat
dripping down my face and prevents hair
from like flying in your face when
you're running outside it's windy and
yours like you know what i mean one of
you lucky ladies will get headphones and
everything else i just showed in a
little fun fitness sweat it out type of
package I know Tampax is just partnering
with Hannah Bronfman at the founder of
HB fit to help you stay fit this winter
and beyond
yeah I'm just giving away some of Hannah
Browne pins at favorite workout gear
super excited about its you can comment
down below or tag me in a post i'm
social media to show me how you get in
motion and can also attack Tampax and i
know you can use the hashtag it sweat it
out swag for your chance to win
yeah i know this has been a long girl
talk but i could talk so long about
feeling comfortable in your own skin and
just like defying the norms a society
has like put in place for us like why
should we feel weird about tampons and
our periods and that's just a part of
being a girl you know what I mean and
who said when you're on your period that
you can't work out and you have to like
lay in your couch and be sad all day
need chocolate you definitely don't have
to do that anyway definitely ends with
us you can it win some fun little items
and yeah I have some study tubers and
titles tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
