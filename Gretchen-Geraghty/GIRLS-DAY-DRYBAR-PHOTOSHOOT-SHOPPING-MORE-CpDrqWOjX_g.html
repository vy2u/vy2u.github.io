pampered a routine or I guess just being
extra and being really girly basically
don't should I just thought it would be
a really fun day to get our makeup done
get some blowouts which has never been
to drive our before so is it super fun
I'm so my new camera right now by the
way I'm gonna tell and I'm still
experimenting like I don't really know
how to use it but let me know if you
think the quality isn't really said it
or anything so we went to mak around
10:00 and we got really good makeup done
it was really fun we actually weren't
allowed to film in there because Mac is
just really strict on that when I filmed
a little bit sneakily in the bathroom
anyway cuz I think as long as we're not
filming like been doing our makeup it's
okay actually before that we went to the
pantry tone and have a cute little
breakfast so that was so nice and as you
can tell the clips to it was very much
there was Tasha me and Lindsey and
Lindsey's just another intern with us
here at doe after the highway spend
shopping a little bit went to Zara
didn't film at too much in there then we
went into Sephora and the nose hanford
Drybar it was so fun when you drive art
we love drive our we were alive
there it was so nice I just love going
this is such a fun environment and
everyone's just so welcoming and I kind
of know it just like a happy time and it
was really fun to go with Tasha and
Lindsay since it was their first time
and I just got so excited for them so I
just got like the straight-up flow out
which is just when they like round brush
your hair out because I just like
something that might be simple to then
to keep on the extra bushi miss beam
Tasha I'm like hey we can use ik
manicure so you went and just got
manicures right now I've just got a
French a little gel manicure I love that
this DSLR auto focuses on video that's
so nice we just found a little place in
the air hotel it's Claire and they all
said right now we're actually getting
ready a super quick because they're
going to take photos with Alex who is
actually photographer that reached out
to us we just knew that like getting
already inside today it would have a
purpose so that we would take a lot of
pictures and a lot of content to be
running joke shopping in social media
Instagram their Twitter that's why we
thought this would be a really good day
to get like blog content and it also
thought it could be a cool name channel
video just to show you guys a fun day in
York City and obviously this isn't like
they think I brought drinks like I don't
know I don't want this to be taken our
land all I just wanted you guys to see a
fun little day because it was just
really a finding special sharing pasta
and Lindsay and yeah I got a chat right
now I gotta put on some clothes I think
I want to get out three different
outfits to wear for a little photo shoot
cause I'm definitely not gonna wear this
little dress I'm just gonna this is just
my life going around getting manicures
love dress you know but I'm gonna find
cute outfits later hopefully take some
little cute pictures and then I think
tonight Tasha matters
where maybe meet up with my friends
later so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed
this video thank you so much for
watching I'll see my next one bye PS I'm
really sorry if I kept looking in the
viewfinder I just like don't know how
this camera works or like where I am on
the screen or anything and this is
probably tilted I don't have a tripod
I'm sitting whether we've been still in
this hotel so yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
