you guys know my best friend Hannah but
I'm high school it's so weird because I
think when you go to college I just
don't like to think of myself as like
being young okay and everything but it's
like oh my friend Hannah from like way
back in high school I just think of like
my friend and I said into my high school
it used to looking best friend do you
know what I mean like I felt it was
yesterday but I'm in my second semester
junior year of college which really
really weird anyway I just made some
toast

butter banana honey this is my go-to so
guys I'm just sitting down really quick
to show you some new it clothes that I
got they're all from Cheyenne and
they're like super super affordable what
I realized is my friend Daniela Karolina
you guys down here here on YouTube she
actually was the one that told me about
this like she pretty much just gets a
lot of her clothes from like her 21 she
and ROM I like websites like that and
then just gets like expensive
accessories to dress it up because I
just like you look still put together
that way so I would really recommend
like more affordable clothing and I
think I've just been kind of going in
that direction because when I buy like
really basic really expensive clothes
it's like what's even the point you
don't I mean anyway oh also I was gonna
like get really cute so I could show you
my clothes right now but I'm about to go
to the gym and I'm wearing a rowing
sweatshirt and I just like don't really
makeup on but that's okay so we're just
gonna be really real today first thing I
just try to Cheyenne

of a lot I just want you know I'll have
a link down below so you have the links
to it posted a picture with it on
Instagram it's just as gray cropped
hoodie and everyone was asking where
it's from and I actually had a Greg
crops hoodie that looks literally
exactly like this from brandy melville
but I lost it and I'm still sad about it
but this is exactly the same and it's so
cute and so cozy and it's my picture my
Instagram with Ireland you guys the
other one so I love it so I recommend it
go buy it we can be twins
and this next top I got is just really
hard to show up so I'll just show you on
it's just like one of those wraparound
tiny tops really cute and black then I
got this red sweatshirt I like that it's
like kind of like thinner so you just
like throw it on when you're like be an
athleisure like athleisure is my new
thing like all I wear is like leggings
and my like Brookes running sneakers
which are lime green and blue but it's
okay sometimes you're just not that
fashionable it's fine but yeah now I'm
just like I feel like being second
semester junior and college
I've just been overlooking cute I just
like look like athleisure if that's what
I look like this is just this really
pretty like heathered like red color I
really like this color red so I'm about
this then I got this t-shirt which I
thought was so cute it's like this light
gray t-shirt with a cute little cactus
how cute and it just ties at the bottom
and a little knot and this white top at
Taylor was like oh my god I'm gonna
steal it she thought it was so cute and
I agree it's like this white little
blouse short sleeve flows out at the
bottom and a little peplum ties in the
back and it's also open in the back I
love how she and has like literally so
many clothes in there so like there's
gonna be something for you they have so
much stuff then I got this grey
off-the-shoulder
shirt and it's like roughly and cinchy
and cropped obviously and like ties in a
little bow and this would be really cute

great weekend anyway this is a white
off-the-shoulder kind of long sleeve or
3/4 sleeve shirt it's like a little
ribbed and roughly and cute and this
shirt actually looks exactly like one
that Lucy has from Urban Outfitters
that's like off-the-shoulder she has it
in white and then like kind of flares at
the sleeve this is just like a maroon
color then I got this white shirt it's
just long-sleeve again flow that the
sleeves kind of crosses in the front I
think it's adorable I with the detail of
it then I got this white short sleeve
kind of cropped shirt and obviously
looks funny right there but because you
tie it a little not like this is a
perfect example of like basic and cheap
and like if that was a hundred dollars
from like All Saints you wouldn't know
the difference you know what I mean then
I got another black this one's really
stretchy and like comfy feeling and like
ties in the front shirt this I just
thought was like really cool and I feel
like what cool of Instagram on the 4th
of July this is this gray cropped
t-shirt that says USA with little
American flag oh then I got this like
ribbed long-sleeve a black shirt and it
kind of goes up a little bit higher like
a turtleneck and I wanted a shirt with
this kind of neck I don't know what you
call this like a half turtleneck for a
while and I saw this on there and I was
like yup I'm getting

it kind of has a little V look a little
baby one right there in the front just a
little t-shirt super cute I got this
gray t-shirt it's like this charcoal
color has a little lightning bolt I just
thought it was like cute and trendy and

roughly cinchy top I like the cut of
this and it's just like the cut of it
the type type that it's just like
triangle top you know and then some
white bottoms to go with I'm going to
the beach so much in the next
approaching month so I gotta have some
