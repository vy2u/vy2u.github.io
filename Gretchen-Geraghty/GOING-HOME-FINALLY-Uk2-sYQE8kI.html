weekend
business casual please let me know I do
yeah oh my god just so tingly hey I just
hope Mike a million nurses good morning
today and you guys running late to
class my horse on its way so I have to
freakin go because it takes like 10
hours to get down from the floor that
we're on a shall not be named because
it's really high up but yeah this is my
outfit because today we're presenting my
team and it is business casual please
let me know it's like a black jumpsuit
what I figured
I guess business casual I don't know but
I got a jet also going home tonight
yay Eddie whoa so guys I just got back
from court and we got out a little bit
early today which is really good because
our presentations just went by quick and
that way I could come back here for just
grab my bag to go home so I didn't have
to bring two bags to cross it that makes
sense
umm so yeah that just like worked out
well I was kind of digging him the hope
that we'd get out early and I did and
thank you so much Ivan by the way
everyone's my buddy in class and he just
helped me carry my packages they were
really heavy and yeah I really
appreciated it because I always with
Miller Malone and like I can't carry one
package that so I got a package from
honey bun which you guys know is like my
favorite clothes like maybe they restore
so expect a new haul video then coming
soon and then I'm so excited because I
actually got this makeup mirror and I've
been needing a mirror I can put on my
desk to human makeup for like so long
this is the one I had last year I don't
know if he would like remember it at all
but I had like a little magnifying
light-up mirror that I had in my desk
last year show me makeup I left it in my
room when I moved out so I said it's not
a makeup mirror and I've been having too
many makeup and the bathroom which is
fine I actually like to make up like a
big mirror but there's four of us and
when they are trying to like brush their
teeth and get ready and like dry their
hair and straighten their hair and go to
the bathroom and stuff I'm just like in
the way and like I like being able to
like sit down and chill and do my makeup
for a while because I can get fun and I
like
so like yeah anyway I'm very short I'm
really happy I got a makeup man and I
feel like I'm talking mile minute so I'm
like freaking out that I have to like go
catch my bus because I just want to be
late and even though it's not even 4:00
yet and my bus leaves at like 5:00 or
need to go home
Boston during rush hour is like the
worst thing ever and I just now realized
I think I can take the T to the bus
station instead of having to over there
because I always over at little Jake's
an hour because of traffic but I think
if I take the teeth and just like
underground a lot of the way it'll be
quicker if that make sense oh no I'm
gonna try and see how it goes I don't
think it gets me exactly there but I
think it gets me it's like the Boylston
stop which is like a half a mile away I
did some research we'll try it out we'll
see how it goes a presentation went
super well our professors asked some
really good constructive questions and
we were able to answer them explain them
and yeah so far carpaccio is going
really well it's just like stressful and
a lot of time so there's not a lot of
time for a lot of other things but um
making time for my family this weekend
and free teddy and my mom my dad and
Lucas obviously mirrors but yeah I'm
gonna have to make myself study for
midterms this weekend because midterms
for core are next week Tuesday Thursday
5 p.m. to 9 p.m.
I just love nighttime exams I'm being so
cash I got hate nighttime exams loading
my brain shuts off after like 8:00 so
that's gonna be really hard for me but I
hope power through a nap during the day
or something I don't know I just find
I'm like way more put up to the game way
more stuff done in the morning wait guys

packages and I'm actually being a Barbie
