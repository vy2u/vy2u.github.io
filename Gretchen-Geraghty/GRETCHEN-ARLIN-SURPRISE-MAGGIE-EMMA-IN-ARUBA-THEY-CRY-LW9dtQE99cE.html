going to meet with Kevin who is really
nice and letting us rent parking from
him for the summer and super close to
our apartment so we're gonna go meet up
with him and we're excited to meet him
in real life because we have heard him
on the phone
a bunch it means like a really thick
Boston accent so that'll be fun and then
we're gonna go to our friend
Hannah's graduation she is graduating
from the school hospitality and that's
at like ten inches to be our roommate
for the summer too so yeah it's plan it
then the rest of the day I have to move
the rest of my stuff in because I only
got like my bed and a couple other
things like all my clothes and shoes and
stuff are still in studi and then I got
a pack and get ready for actually this
is gonna go up after so now I can tell
you oh yeah this is definitely going up
after we surprised them this is a weird
I can talk about it in the video now but
me and arlynn are actually flying to
Aruba tomorrow morning so we're gonna
surprise Maggie and Emma which is so
insane and still feel surreal I guys
texting this morning I was like do like
I just checked us in for our flight and
like like this doesn't feel real that
we're going yet so I got a pack for that
and you got to leave it like 6:15 in the
morning to make our flight that's at
like 8:00 um so yeah that's the plan oh
and then we're gonna have time cuz
meeting with Kevin is gonna be quick so
they're making a coffee after well I'm
having a Bobbi Avenue coffee and yeah
whoa how was your first sleep in our
permits good yeah I think the blinds are
only do anything minutes yeah okay so
once we got here these two blinds worked
but they are really loud and like
squeaky that one is broken so I was
scared that this was gonna be really
bright and make us up but it's like
pretty cloudy anyway I could have slept
all day and the air conditioner is like
so loud like a loud fans make me sleep
so well so yeah we gotta figure out a
Wi-Fi situation like utilities
well I guess utilities are on cuz like
the lights and like like electric and
stuff is on Wow know about Wi-Fi we've
never asked we gotta figure that out
we're back from our meeting with keV
they went up we paid and I hate too much
of my favorite stupid it was
well actually we can just tell them
because I think it's a great deal you
guys know parking about
so hard and since we're both doing it
150 a month but he was like oh you guys
can just you 125 a month like 125 a
month that's I don't think that's bad
and so then we just paid it all up front
and don't worry like we know Kevin he's
good like yeah Mike yeah thank you so
her parents really you're gonna pay and
he's gonna like disappear and you're not
real talk but like we found him on the
internet but oh yes we just handed him
like 375 each in cash but I gave him 385
because I counted wrong and I'm just
dumb but it's fine I was like you know I
can go buy yourself a coffee you have
yourself a morning away I wanted to show
them this mirror is gonna be so good to
show like my outfits I like how big it
is because you can really get the whole
picture it's like you think I know but I
think maybe it is
yeah it's definitely better than yours
you're the one in your room is so awful
every would look so bad in it and but
this is me and Abby's favorite table
it's from I think I got another ball no
ain't no or shop up booming notes if I
forget what brand it is is it is it
lovers and friends I don't think it is I
can't see my hands in the way but I've
shown it before I keep having oh I
forget and then these black jeans are
Abby's because I don't know how to make
outfits and the jeans that I have looks
bad and there are urban ones but I have
them too and then you guys know my new
shoes they're just so comfy because then
my heels don't get hurt from the shoes
and way and then this bag I got from
Burlington wait people were asking me
the brand I literally don't know I just
thought it was cute it says it somewhere
in here
Oh des and mood have you ever heard of
that even though me neither
I can't even see it there it is that is
that it was cute oh and we still don't
know our Wi-Fi situation so I have to go
upload a video on campus we are gonna
text Chloe we'll figure it out okay
let's hit the road
whoa
again
every business was taken to be you in
two years
who's going my graduation me we are at a
wedding
first and they are the chairs
okay
so yeah
I've never been so happy in the Bakken I
was in a fog when we got the car oh my
gosh it's so rainy and so sweaty and
well were so sweaty and we just moved
all of my stuff for my single inch TV -
to our new apartment me and Abby have
you had to wait like a million hours for
me to get all my stuff and literally
guys it's so much like I don't
understand how I had all of this in my
room
and I have no idea how it's gonna fit in
this room and Louie this is Louisa stuff
right here but she hasn't even moved her
stuff in yet so there's just piles and
piles of clothes under my blankets right
there oh my god that's my bed frame
which I had to have a bed frame because
you put in there but they already have
beds and bed frames and luckily like I
told you we could put the Lisa mattress
on Hannah's bed but um I don't know what
you do about the bed frame itself
because they're like cars and you're not
gonna like stick it in our family room
Alexa help no I'm just sweaty okay I'm
gonna be so stressed this afternoon
trying to go through all my stuff while
packing for a rowboat which is still
rare that I can tell you that but I had
a LexA play me some music and guys I'm a
handyman look at this so I show you
yesterday we got here and that had
fallen the Curan rod with a shower
curtain on the ground and everything and
I just put it back up I just had to
balance on this while trying to fix this
and there we go
I don't think it's like even her
straight or even high up enough but
it'll work for me to shower at least oh
and yesterday was so funny Abbey was
like Gretchen there's literally no light
in the bathroom like look there's no
light switch like choose brush your seed
in the dark and I come in I'm like happy
you have to pull this string and she's
like what like she like never saw lights
like that and I'm like silly pads Louis
dragging the light turns on oh my gosh
I've never been so
gross and sweating my whole life but
yeah I'm just happy while my son is here
and I got a move in as quick as I can
I'll give you guys an update soon
because I'm gonna go help Taylor move
her stuff into her apartment later

I'm starving
um um I know this doesn't seem like a
lot but I think just left is like
dresses and like my blanket but she has
real ingots here so that's what we used
last night
I just got the sheets those are the tan
sheets and then I have from Macy's in
that blog um but yeah I'm God it'll
build a clothing rack right now because
I planned on bringing it it's my single
wear this past year in juvie just for my
junior year in college I mean then my
room is so small that it wouldn't have
fit anywhere so I sent it home and I was
like I'll use it again some other day

gotta go attempt to build that I really
hope I don't need a screwdriver anything
and this is a progress that man again I
know I doesn't seem like a lot but I
hung up like a bunch of my clothes and
I'm gonna move whatever I put there
already over there because I was thieves
