getting ready with me for my first day
of college and the first thing I'm doing
is just tucking my hair back behind my
ear so it's not in my face I probably
should have tightened up but whatever
and then I'm using my favorite
moisturizer which is just the Cetaphil
moisturizing eye
just to get my face all ready for makeup
and then I'm going to be using my bare
minerals concealer with this concealer
brush which is from royal and langnickel
brushes and these are all the brushes
that I'm going to be using today right
now I'm using these foundation ones I
use just the foundation one to actually
apply my foundation which is the
covergirl three-in-one foundation and
the shade is from summertime so that's
why it's like a little bit darker but
it's alright and then I use the
synthetic bronzer brush to buff it all
in and I know it's for bronzer but I
just like the way it makes my foundation
look really flawless and then I'm using
this concealer from Maybelline I believe
just to pop and I need my eyes to kind
of brighten them up in it cover like the
purpleness and then I'm using this
powder from covergirl is well I really
really like this powder it's one my
favorites and I'm using it with the
royal brush it's just the powder one and
then this is also one of my favorite
bronzers it's just Hula's bronzer by
benefit it's a really good contour color
and I just use the bronzer brush from
that kit and that kit I'll have linked
all down below I really love these
brushes they're like really really great
quality so yeah they're super also and I
definitely would recommend them and then
for blush I'm using this blush brush
that came with the kit and I'm using
another benefit blush and then it was
Dallas by the way and then I'm using
this highlighter which is from Becca
actually god I like over the summer and
I really really love it it's like so
shiny and I just used it with a little
fan brush and then I'm using benefit
eyebrow to highlight under my eyebrows
and true story guys I've never felt in
my eyebrows before but after watching
this little clip I feel like I should so
if you have any like good eyebrow filler
things just comment down below so that I
can know how to fill in my eyebrows and
then I am yeah I just fill in my eyes
with some nude eyeliner and I curled my
eyelashes cuz I have to cut my shoes
they're like so short otherwise and then
you guys know this deal
eyeliner like stay all day eyeliner is
my favorite eyeliner I wear all the time
so that's just what I use to line my
eyes and then I'm using L'Oreal's
telescopic mascara because you guys know
that's also my favorite mascara so it's
seriously the best and I love it the way
that looks and then using this perfume
from said bird it's actually in the
scent Chloe it's by the brand Chloe it
smells so good and I love Sam bird it's

perfume every month so it's seriously so
awesome and you guys should definitely
check it out I will have it linked it
down below but yeah I just love it and
it's also in this portable little
perfume container so that's really
awesome now I'm just straightening my
hair which is like super boring and I
think I always do that but I just like
the way it looks it looks really like
you sleek and pulled together I guess
and I'm actually using my friend
Taylor's chiere to do it because I left
mine at home

just has like the blue one it makes my
hair super straight and sleek so I love
that straightener then I'm wearing this
necklace from Happiness boutique and my
