it's kind of light for me too but like
I'm gonna light mine's dark
mine's look yeah mine's light so more
the opposite but it's like because I put
self tanner on and then I'm gonna use
bronzer like bronze up my face a lot
just because oh my god my mirror
literally scre yeah I actually think
that it's better it's better if you
later find anything because you can like
prompt it up
yeah foundation simply try to make it
wider and I like to just sometimes give
if I go a little bit lighter just use a
lot of it
I thought you were about to be like I

the Beauty Blender I use it is the real
tech really use the real technique yeah
bigger and it's fluffy you're looking
yeah is yours Beauty Blender yeah those
are awesome they're five bucks

my under eye concealer um it's the 50
beauty one and I'm climbing with my
finger and it's in the shade bamboo I'm
using anymore I need your mind to using
my Beauty Blender on my nose forehead
Cupid's bow chin
I'm so not like you look cute makeup ask
me I don't know I'm like not look at how
light mine is this is how I make my
foundation later you're cute with like
white concealer I have this shade fair
I'm pretty sure oh no light when you
like blend it up it looks really good on
you
I like it because I never really put it
here but I think that maybe it will look
cool for today

of makeup it's a full sensor Gretchen's
full send ya questions big bender okay
we said a really funny one last time
would you say I don't remember but Kitty

mm-hmm okay so that's all blended out oh
wait guys I don't know when we're gonna
have to do it when we're in a mood but
I've been excited for this for so long
I've been keeping track on my phone and
a note and writing down all of our
sayings which is really like and I want
to make the video like explaining our
language but really it's like Maggie and
Emma's language I'd say that you guys
like no legit it's not Emma
it's legit needed you and I do say it
because I'm with her so much that like I
don't know and it's like really funny
and it's like phrases that like I've
definitely caught on like you guys know
he's a baby not even us
and Mike knows why I don't know why like
a random job that means like I just
don't say it being seriously but it's
just like that comes out of my mouth
that I'm like we would give me a job to
say everyone and people have no idea
what's going on so I really want to make
a funny video just saying like all of
the things we say cuz you guys are gonna
little bit you're crazy like what are
you talking about
so yeah it'll be funny look out for that
and we should we should try to explain
their meaning oh my god
to do so much hippie is when you have a
person an item a place that's a Jimmy
but Jackson is bad yes a Jackson isn't
as good as a Jimmy okay that's just a
preview nation this mirrors so little
I'm using my hula when I like in I
thought you were looking in the hole in
the pan as your mayor and imagine I'm
using Mac Studio Fix I'm pretty sure
this is like eight years old okay Mac
Studio Fix is like the og of makeup
that's all I used on you and I thought
it broke me out but then Here I am using
it again and it's actually fine I'm
gonna like bronze up my face like crazy
have you guys known as my skin's gotten
better like Ivan I know is that your
skin just looks so like glowy and really
radiant yeah and I feel like it's all
one color like it's super oily like like
its own even that like knocking on it so
I was looking at this morning at
Starbucks I noticed that you look she's
so like Eden that's really nice because
I feel like that's the man I'm insecure
about my skin tone me uneven
okay so I get a lot of redness with my
khakis going down there and I just have
someone with my forehead and stuff but
with like that CC cream it's like really
full coverage like don't want to even
though it's CC cream it's like beautiful
coverage my at my face it's all like it
matches my body but I swear hey well um
and so then my face looks more even like
all this in a slick full coverage powder
wait there's me really good sorry to cut
you off but oh I'm gonna look in my Kat
Von D shade and light palette I'm
obsessed with is this pretty good I got
this for Christmas when it was like sold
out I guess Katie was like how did you
get that it sold out I put on a lot of
bronzer and oh me too and I'm gonna just
mix these two at the bottom we can just
flip it over the ocean what type I use
chocolate chocolate
this is what I fight against to the you
I have in seventh grade yeah and then I
just got a new one and I fell in love
with it again cuz it's so dark I haven't
used that since I discovered whoo
mm-hmm I go back and forth between
listen to him I like hallways and lagoon
at mine ours I've never used that cavies
obsessive ed you would like it and she
likes that bronzer blush duo yes I got
my little that for big little week did
you really yeah I got her like all my
favorite makeup and I think I said in a
little note like you have to let me get
this like your mom's favorite and she's
like wait Gretchen and everyone was like
obviously grass is your bag who else
would give you like nice before makeup
that's so you I know okay
okay I'm gonna do my under eyes with
this like little banana shade in the
middle banana powder and Ana I always
hear people talk about that stuff yeah I
like it with me I don't know why I just
like brightens up mm-hmm
they're nice cuz they're so like a
little so where's remember I tell you my
new favorite trick cards with my nose
yeah people okay okay look at my nose
now I get out a little bit too much and
then look at it after I go like this
this is hard cuz the lighting like isn't
even like it's like over here not like
so I don't really know how this is gonna
turn out but we'll see you go like that
and then you might blend it out and your
nose just looks like it hmm
swim bandage in Zulu me Jim I'm using
blush in the shade party and it's the
Tarte Amazonian clay blush my absolute
favorite feeling okay I don't wear
makeup and whenever I see myself with
makeup on and I'm like whoa people on my
channel are a big Maggie you look so
different
wait I did put on my eyes don't cry her
yet okay now look at my nose see it's
like skinnier with the bronzer

we're leaving banged up because we're
sitting on the floor but I'm going to
use this two-faced highlighter in the
shade ray of light and I'm just using a
little fan brush bye I love those two
okay no one hate me I literally just put
a shadow primer on over bronzer that I
put my crease I'm sorry I forgot I had
to do that I know that's probably like
the worst right eye shadow primer from
pepper doesn't he stop don't shock the
urban decay like comments I don't hear
because I know everything big question
ha like funny but seriously get a new
one that's dangerous and you're gonna
infect your eyes you're ten years old

if you do the cup scene 5 okay it was
like oh my god this one's my favorite
I'm like I haven't seen that container
