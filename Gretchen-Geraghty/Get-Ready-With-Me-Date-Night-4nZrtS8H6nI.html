I'm going to be showing you how I got
ready for a my date night so you really
can use this look if you're getting
ready to go out to dinner or whatever
you want so the first thing I'm doing is
my makeup and I actually already did my
foundation you can look it back at my
foundation routine because it really
hasn't changed so I thought I would just
leave that out just be this up a bit and
so first thing I'm doing is just
contouring my face and I've been loving
this
Anastasia like contour kit recently and
I use the brown color in the middle at
the bottom like ro and I really just
like this contour color it like works so
perfect and I've been using it so much
because I love the way it comes out and
I just blend it down to my neck to so
that it all blends together and you
don't want with a really light neck then
I'm using benefits Dallas blush and I've
been using this a lot recently - it's
been like a recent favorite and it's
just like a really pretty blush it's
kind of like darker than usual and then
I'm using Mac's mineralize skinfinish
natural and soft and gentle as just a
little highlighter on my cheeks it makes
it look nice and sparkly
then I'm using Urban Decay's primer
potion on my eyelids just to get the
money for eyeshadow now I'm feeling my
lashes and I like to kind of run my
fingers through them after so they're
not all like messed up I don't know then
I'm using Maybelline's I think it's my
Maybelline it's just like an eyeshadow
base and it's in the color of breath bad
to the bronze and it just looks really
pretty on your eyes and it's like good
to go under other kind of bronzy colors
and I'm just using these three and Sigma
brushes there's like a fluffy one in the
mango blood and just like a flat one and
then I'm using those two colors of my
eyelids and then those darker ones and
just like blend it out and make it
darker I'm like the outside corner so
I'm using the lightest one on my lid and
I'm using a little bit darker one I'm
like the outer half of my lid and then
I'm gonna take my angled brush and I'm
going to start blending like the darker
color up into my crease a little more
and as you saw I just kind of dragged it
below my lash line too because I like
the way that looks and then I'm taking
my just big fluffy
brush and I'm blending it all out then
I'm using this nude eyeliner I want to
say it's from Rimmel and I really like
the way this looks just on the waterline
and I really think it like opens your
eyes it makes you look more like awake
and now I'm doing my eyeliner that I do
like every single day this is just the
Stila like waterproof stay all day
eyeliner and yeah I'm not really pulling
my eyelids and I know people have
commented about that in videos past and
I'm really sorry I don't know how I do
that I know it's like bad to like pull
out your eyes a lot but I don't know why
I just always do that so yeah it was
kind of hard to get on camera but I just
tried to do like a really easy viewing
like straight line and I just really
like follow the shape of my eyes and
then now I'm tight lining my eyes with
just an urban decay like black eyeliner
pencil and I like where this looks
because it just kind of looks more dark
and it blends like the liquid eyeliner
better and then I'm doing my mascara
which is clearly L'Oreal telescopic and
I showed a million times so yeah that's
just that now I'm using some lip gloss
it's by buxom and it's in the color
mudslide it's like a funny name for a
color but it is really pretty kind of
darker like berry color I would say and
that is all I did it for my makeup so
now we're moving on to hair and I'm
actually using new Me's curl Jemma set
which comes with a straightener I'm like
three different barrels today I'm going
to be using the biggest one because I
like to do really big ways and so my
hair has just dried all the way from my
shower I just took like right before
this video and so it just dries kind of
like naturally a little straight and I'm
just spraying in some heat protectant
before I curl my hair now I'm brushing
it out with actually a brush from nume
and it's just really big like paddle
brush and I like those a lot because
they're like way easier to use like
smaller ones and they make your hair
really like soft and brushed out now I'm
using the biggest barrel like I said
before and I'm just wrapping around the
hair I take pretty big sections because
I like it to be like big and loose a
lady and I'm going slow and beginning
just to show you exactly what I'm doing
I only hold it for a few seconds I hold
it in my hand
and then I let it go so I actually have
some discount codes for you guys whoaaah
if you use the code golden tan you'll
get 40% off any curling set and free
shipping to the US and another one you
can use is the code sparkly water which
will get you $100 off of any movie set
and I've really been obsessed with all I
knew me like hair styling products
recently especially these curling wands
because curling my hair is usually look
pretty hard and I find that a lot of
curls won't like to stay in my hair
after I've curled that and I have to use
like hairspray but I don't know why I
like these new ones just works so well
and I actually don't even use hairspray
in my hair you can see just like I'm not
even holding my hair on the curling on
that long I just like stays the curls
just I don't know the curling wands work
really well and the curls stay in my
hair for a really long time if I just
want to leave them for like second day
curls the next day they work so well and
so like I said before I make the curls
really loose and I take my big sections
so we really just go back through the
one side of my hair and I will take like
smaller sections and just kind of curl
those like blend it all out and yeah so
as you can see I really don't even hold
my hair that long on the barrel and then
afterwards I like to hold it in my hand
just kind of like all bunched together
to like let those curl actually form so
I'm going quicker on this side just
because I showed you the other side and
I curled them all away from my face and
I really like the way it turns out and
Here I am
just going back through and taking some
smaller sections and yeah I just really
like the way it turns out and I just
kind of run my fingers through it at the
end and it falls out a little bit later
in the day and it just looks nice and
loose and wavy and I love the way the
new me spilling on to make my hair look
so now I'm using this argan oil that's
also actually from Mimi and you can find
out our website and I love it because it
smells super good and it makes my hair
really soft and shiny
I've just been rubbing it in my hair
after I this been styling it recently
and it just makes it so it's soft and
shiny
yeah I really like that too all right so
now that my hair is done for my outfit
I'm actually putting on this statement
necklace that's from New York and
company so it's really pretty like mint
green necklace it is kind of darker at
the top and like later at the bottom and
I just love the way it looks so yeah
that is like how my hair looks and I
really love the way that comes out I'm
like obsessed I've been doing lots of
like loose curls recently and don't
forget I have all those discount code
link down below for you me so definitely
go check those out because they're
literally my favorite hair styling
products so that is the way my makeup
turned out and I'm using this nail
polish from OPI called you don't know
Jacques and it's this really pretty
taupe color and for my outfit I'll it a
little bit more casual for this date
night I'm not wearing like a big fancy
dress or anything but I'm lining this
tight black top from PacSun and it just
scoops really low in the back I really
like that do you I think it's really
cute and I'm wearing these a trip jeans
from American Eagle that I literally
wear all the time you guys definitely
have seen them before but just like
these skinny jeggings I think they're
like jeggings and I went in grab my
booties at from Steve Madden they were
just these hand cutout booties that I
wear all the time that you guys also
like too so yeah that is the finished
look and thank you so much for watching
