to Dallas Auggie coats and breathe blow
so right now I'm just applying my Sarah
be moisturizer all over my face before I
my foundation to make that concoction
foundation I just mix two shades of
Revlon Colorstay which are listed down
below you are interested if any of you
saw my foundation routine that was on me
to field two days really recently I
deleted it because it was awful and that
HD foundation from make up forever just
didn't match me and I end up returning
it so this is new and improved and yeah
and now I'm just blending my foundation
with my Beauty Blender and our first I
thought I didn't really like the Revlon
Colorstay foundation but I realized I
just wasn't applying it in the way that
was best for me so I really like
applying it with the Beauty Blender
because it makes it look nice in bundy
and it doesn't feel like all caked onto
my face so yeah that is just what i'm
doing right now and the blunt look crazy
so that's why this party so wat social
so the time I saw get close and breeze
blow she's morphine queen of my back
soon my love my own and now I'm just
concealing any blemishes or anything
like that
now I'm concealing under my eyes because
I really really dark under eye circles
and this is a concealer made especially
for underneath your eyes so it's really
burning and awesome and I love it and
then i blend it even more with a
synthetic brush which is also a simple
then i like to set my under eye
concealer separately than everything
else just so that it stays really long
time and now i'm setting my whole face
of foundation with um just some powder
just one side the same model my mom
instead of contouring with bronzer I
just like to have like an overall bronze
to look so I take my really big on
fluffy brush and I put it um pretty much
all over my face as you just saw and
and I'm doing some blush just on my
cheeks with a smile blush brush to put
on chapstick narrow just said it's a
nice moisturize and I'm having my late
please don't know
so I did you
this is pretty much what i've been doing
every day so just go for like a light
shimmery colors on your eyelids and then
a slightly darker brown color
I let you fall
and then I'm taking a darker color and
putting that in my I also bring
so don't forget to blend blend blend and
highlight is well I'm violating my inner
corners and she spoke words out worth
melt in your hands and she spa for now
i'm doing my top eyeliner it's just a
black gel eyeliner and yeah sorry zoomed
out i couldn't really get close because
i go kind of crazy when i do my eyeliner
I'm not really good at it at all and i'm
just trying to do like a pretty thin
line and actually came out really thin
today so that was good is usually its
way to check but yeah
it's really important to curl those
eyelashes especially if you have really
short eyelashes like me it just makes
your mascara it looks so much better and
you're going to notice that I put on a
lot of mascara not gonna lie i always
put on one layer one mascara and then
like another light of like a volumizing
mascara just take my eyelashes look even
more amazing Hinda stop the way some
people to base man many surprises away
in the race man
you know
she's coming
No
seek a shine
yes i am still putting on mascara gosh i
well until undress kara but like i said
before i really like to put on a lot
because I thin short eyelashes so this
just makes them stand out more and I let
them dry in between each application
we're like maximum benefits so yeah now
I'm wipe away any mascara that might
have gotten onto my eyelid because you
know I'm make mistakes whatever and then
I'm going to be taking this light ibrary
pencil to look open up my eyes now I'm
coming out my brows I usually don't fill
them in because my eyebrows are pretty
thick but yeah I just kind of hung them
through now I'm setting my face with my
Urban Decay all nighter spray this just
makes my makeup Stan and i'm using a
sugar lip balm and berry and I'm hiding
my face with a nice little it cream
highlighter
my hair is still kind of damp and I
didn't cook doing anything so I'm just
putting it up in a bun and as you can
see i just kind of twisted around and
that is it so thank you so much for
