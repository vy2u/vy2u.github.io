ready with me video and this is actually
a couple days after my high school
graduation but I'm just going to be
showing you exactly what I did to get
ready for my high school graduation
because I had to get up early early in
the morning to do it and I have family
here so I couldn't really film but now I
have some time to show you exactly what
I did and I really like the way my
makeup came out and my hair and
everything
so I'm just going to be showing you
everything that I did and I also decided
I would talk through this video because
I've never done like a chit chat kind of
get ready with me where I'm like talking
through as I'm doing their makeup so I
thought that would be really interesting
and yeah let's just get right into it so
I showered in my hair is just wet and I
think I'm gonna do my hair last just add
some more time to dry while I'm doing my
makeup so moisturizing your face is a
very key when you're putting on
foundation I'm going to be using this
foundation today and I already put on my
setup on moisturizer but you guys know I
use and the first thing I'm doing is
priming my face with this beautybay
foundation primer and beautybay is just
like his online seller of makeup and
they have some like affordable brands
like their online is actually pretty
affordable but they also have other like
high-end brands that you find out like
Sephora so it's really good for that and
it's really convenient because there's
free shipping I think if you spend over
like 16 dollars so most likely okay free
shipping if you order from there and
yeah it's just really convenient to go
on there save a whole bunch of stuff and
I'm going to be showing you some other
stuff from the Beauty Bay line that they
have and it's like really affordable and
really nice like I love this primer and
like this little sponge which actually
works just like my Beauty Blender and
also I believe I'm in beauty day there's
some brands that they don't have that
other places so they're like exclusive
just to maybe BAE's website and
everything I ever beautybay will be a
linked down below and you can use the
promo code beautiful for 10% off of
Beauty BAE's website first thing I'm
doing is just using this foundation
I think I'm gonna have trouble talking
through this because I don't know if I
can multi-task I do have some breakouts
right now as you can see along my
forehead but we will do our best to
cover those puppies up sorry I'm like
gross the making against video don't
worry we'll get some makeup on soon I'm
just going to be taking a pump of my
covergirl outlast stay fabulous 3 and 1
foundation in the shade 875 it's pretty
dark and I know it's gonna be a little
bit darker for me right now because I
got really tan at the beginning of the
summer and I think it's hard to fade a
little bit because it's been a little
cold and rainy here so this might look a
little dark but I like blended into my
neck and everything so it'll be okay
I'm here like right over here that I'm
okay too so it might look like a little
darker but I will blend it I'm just
taking this damp sponge from PD Bay and
it's just a pink sponge that you can do
your foundation with and it's actually
just like my Beauty Blender because I
have the Beauty Blender too and I really
don't notice much of a difference it's a
little bit stiffer but other than that
it works pretty much the same
Lendl is in le to bring it over to
islands to because I don't want my
shadow usually and I did enjoy
graduation because I just wasn't feeling
it and then I'm gonna take a little bit
more and just going to dump my neck to
blend it all in because no one likes a
terrible foundation line sorry my voice
is kind of gone right now to be I
honestly can't believe I graduated high
school it's still like surreal to me
like I can't even believe it so I'm just
using this so I'm just using this
Maybelline instant age rewind under-eye
concealer and it's a little bit lighter
than my skin tone which I like because
it's like highlighting you know and then
I'm just going to blend it in with this
pink little makeup sponge again from
Beauty Buffet and I'm going to be taking
my bare minerals concealer did you guys
know I use this like forever I just take
this little concealer brush from Sigma
and I am just concealing several little
images I have and it's a little bit
later than my foundation so it's kind of
scary
you'll probably able to see like where I
put my concealer but it's okay because
once I put on my powder over top of my
foundation it kind of evens out the
concealer so you can't tell but it's too
late
I just have lots of like discolorations
and like a scarring because I used to
have really bad acne probably through
like freshman year top ring of high
school so my skin really isn't an Isis
it's a little uneven and I still freaked
out a lot so that's not fun
okay I'll concealed and now I'm just
going to set everything with my
covergirl powder it is the clean powder
and 535 and medium light and I've
actually been using this because um for
a while I've used my Mac powder but it's
a little bit too light for me I couldn't
moment in this one pretty dark 535 so I
just take my big fluffy Sigma brush and
just put it all over my face just today
guys I miss doing makeup videos usually
it's like I just you like fashion videos
or like talking videos but I really do
enjoy doing a makeup if I have the time
for it and I also just cuz you don't
want that variable little mask that
foundation can make sometimes so I got
this little brush set from Beauty Bay
which is like so cute it's like really
easy to bring places you just like zip
it up and look at there's a little
mirror in there that you can pull out
but I'm just taking this little fluffy
brush which is really for eyeshadow but
I'm going to take my powder and just use
this just to set my under eye concealer
cuz I under eye concealer crease is it's
okay now we're gonna move on to bronzer
and I'm using my hoola bronzer from
benefit to use it for a while that I did
in and I started using it again recently
and you know why it's probably my
favorite bronzer of all time to be
honest because it makes like a really
good contour and I'm just using this
beautybay little kabuki brush because
it's like dense but like a little bit
smaller so it's really good for
contouring and I just called this and
work this into my cheeks look at how
good that came out see that nice little
contour it makes your face really define
the looking bronzer is honestly my
favorite part of doing my makeup because
I just like the way like it sculpture
piece it just looks good and I also like
to bring this down my neck of it just to
let you know this is kind of cool to
that I'm doing the whole graduation
getting ready with me after graduation
so I can tell you guys so like how it
was now I'm just taking this big fluffy
brush from Beauty Bay and I'm going to
be using it for my blush which is
coralista from benefit I'm just going to
swirl this around coralista isn't my
favorite blush ever and a little style
right on um but yeah so anyways
graduation was like really fun it was
nice to like have some closure with high
school you know not to get all deep but
it was also sad and I predicted in my
vlog which will be coming soon for
graduation I knew that I was gonna cry
and I actually didn't cry
I think it's cuz I was very well
prepared you know like thought about it
for awhile I collected myself so yeah
sorry my roots actually look extra bad
right now because my hair is like damp
but they don't look this bad when my
hair is dry you'll see and I'm actually
just going to use this big fluffy brush
from Beauty bag and to put on my
highlighter which is from Mac it's in
the shade soft and gentle sometimes use
my fingers but I don't know
you like using this brush today and you
can see it puts a nice little shimmer
right there you can also bring it down
your nose a little bit you can also put
it on your inner corner of your face
just too perfect and then we move on to
eyes which really has not changed at all
guys whatever I've done for eyes and
other like foundation routines recently
and stuff like that is like what I'm
going to do right now but it's just
because I don't like to like change it
up that much um I really I don't know I
like eye shadow sometimes but I like
struggle with it and I feel like I just
look better with just the eyeliner
mascara pretty much so I just cut my
eyelashes in now surprise surprise you
can guess it I'm going to be using my
Stila stay all day waterproof liquid
eyeliner in black and it's just a thin
little marker and liquid eyeliner thingy
that I apply my eyelids with and I know
this is gonna be hard to talk through
just like that and I do a thin line on
the top of both and I drag it underneath
too and yeah
I feel like I feel usually my eyeliner
comes out worse when I'm filming it just
because I'm like nervous and not really
focus completely man and I'm kind of
worried about filming too if any of your
youtubers were to be like that like your
makeup comes out worse when you film it
just because you're not really focus is
much my job and also I can't really do a
win because that's too difficult for me
so I just drag it out like and I've
gotten better at this um it's taken me a
while to be able to do eyeliner this
well and I'm also not even that good at
it but yeah honestly guys practice makes
perfect because it takes a while
eyeliner is difficult now I'm going to
using my telescopic carbon black mascara
once again are we surprised kids I've
used this puppy a few longest time it
will always be my favorite mascara I am
convinced like pretty much always
getting it all under my eyes don't worry
- I'm very messy when I do my mascara
but you can always go in and clean it up
with a q-tip so that is what I usually
have to do because I get it all over my
eyelids and like underneath - actually a
retic okay I'm gonna let my name is
hairlike dry a little bit before I try
to wipe it off with a q-tip but
meanwhile I can't eyes on my eyes and
I've been doing black on the top and
this nude on the bottom because black on
the top makes it look more like dramatic
I feel like I'm like filled in with your
eyeliner so I'm just taking my
smolder ichael and I go like this don't
don't worry about when I scared guys
I promise I'll get it off and I just
line the top so it's like this and I do
the bottom with this nude rim oh one
because I like the way nude opens your
eyes now it's time for that q-tip you
just go like this and depending on my
scary you use it'll come up easily or
not so easily
usually telescopic comes up pretty easy
see you all better
I wonder how straight it out hard as it
is to talk about your doing your makeup
now I'm just going it to be using Baby
Lips and this matte lip gloss and I
really don't wear lip gloss that much
but for graduation I did because it was
high school graduation and I just go
like this with my baby lips to
moisturize my lips first and then this
matte lip gloss is in the shade petite
indulgence I want to say it was a
limited edition I got it with like other
ones or something because it's mini yeah
I definitely got it with other ones I
remember I don't know it's a pretty much
the only one I like every year it's a
pretty cute little pink color Andy yeah
that is it for my makeup let's move on
to my hate her
I'm gonna be using this detangling brush
from Beauty Bay it's just the brush like
this with like rubber bristles and it's
really good if you like damp hair or wet
hair cuz then it doesn't tear through
your hair I'm just brushing on my hair
with all this
and see my hairs has been trying a lot
while I've been filming this video and
I'm just using the bumble and bumble
hairdressers invisible oil primer I
showed it in a haul video but I got this
because my hairdresser used it and I
love the way it smells
I'm weird I don't know why I don't just
spray them on here but I would spread it
my hand I do a couple pumps of that and
then I just rub it through my hair and I
usually will use it before I use heat or
if I just get out of shower it's kind of
like a conditioner - I don't know it
does like a lot of things I think it
protects against heat and like
conditions and whatnot so that's always
good
then I'm going to be using my cutie
performance hair styling hair blow dryer
just to blow dry my hair before I use a
straightener and this works really well
electrons my hair really well and I'll
have this linked all down below and
everything you should go check it out
it's firm Flatiron experts and you
should definitely check that down below
they have a bunch of good stuff
especially their cutie performance hair
styling line so I'm just going to use
this to blow-dry my hair super quick I
will speed this part up
also I put on this little thing which is
black because I don't know I really
don't know what I'm talking about
I feel like the flat part in the front
helps your hair blow-dry a little bit
straighter or correct me if I'm wrong so
my hair doesn't take that long to dry
because it's pretty thin and then I'm
going to be using this purple hair
straightener so I actually use this to
do loose waves in my hair as you can see
in pictures the wedges don't work too
graduation are from Steve Madden and the
charset Awards from Urban Outfitters and
you will see all those pictures of me
wearing them at the end of this and you
can also see that my hair is curled I
just use this which is verbally
restrained every tribe will have a link
down below eats up from 140 degrees to
450 degrees
it has ceramic plates and it's really
really lightweight and also if you use
the code Gretchen that will give you 80%
off so it literally is only like 40
dollars I believe and I really like the
way it works really well you can use a
table used to straighten your hair or
you can turn it as I'll show you and
it'll make big wigs so I will just show
you how I do waves with this curling
iron you turn it all the way like this
and it makes big waves just like that so
I just go through my whole hair and do
it like that and that'll give you the
waves like you can see in the pictures
and following this twirl and pull and
you can just twirl it like this with
your finger and that helps warm the curl
so that is everything I did to get ready
and sorry I don't really have time to
finish cutting my hair right now but
that's what I did and I hope you enjoy
all the pictures of me graduation at the
end and I'm so excited to go to college
and any of you that graduated good luck
in your future endeavors and I hope you
enjoyed this little makeup look in my
hair and I will see you in my next video
