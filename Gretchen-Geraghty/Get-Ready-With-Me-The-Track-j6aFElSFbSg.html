really super quick that I think is
totally beneficial for you guys this
video is getting ready with me for the
racetrack at the racetrack you've been
spending a whole lot of money on food
and just fun like t-shirts and I know
even betting so you might be wanting
some money and your parents aren't gonna
always want to just hand over a bunch of
money so I just wanted to talk about
this website called Opinion Outpost
really quick and basically it's just a
research company that like rewards you
guys for filling out surveys you just
get free cash just for having your
opinion you can get cash you can get
Amazon gift cards you can get iTunes
gift cards really cool stuff it is 100%
free to join and all you do is check
your promotions tab and your gmail
account to see emails from Opinion
Outpost and the reason you get paid for
this is because research companies want
your opinion on new products TV food
stuff like that also is super super cool
is that there is a ten thousand dollar
quarterly prize drawing for active
members I will have it linked down below
in the downbar in case you are
interested I think it's just a really
cool way to earn some money and so you
can get some nice back-to-school clothes
so without further ado we will get into
me getting ready for the race track I
put on probably a little bit more makeup
than usual just because it's for the
race track I put on eyeshadow and yeah I
hope you enjoy so I'm starting off
absolutely no makeup and my skin isn't
perfect as you can see I have some acne
and some acne scarring but that's just
the way it goes
the first thing I'm doing is pulling
back my hair into a bun so that it
doesn't get in the way or get my face
when I'm doing my makeup then I'm
putting on some strawberry lip balm from
Sephora and now I'm using an under-eye
concealer eye roller from Garnier and
then I am using some bare minerals
concealer on my face it's my favorite
one it's just really thick and creamy
and covers up the scars and the pimples
that I have at the time then I'm using
bare minerals and it's a pretty dark
shade it's medium tan it's pretty dark
and then I'm using my favorite bronzers
which is by toothpaste it's chocolate so
I
is also pretty dark I'm pretty much the
tannest I get all summer right now just
from lifeguarding all summer long I'm
using bail Obama from benefit which is
one of my favorite blushes it's just
really pink then I'm priming my eyes
with Urban Decay's eyeshadow primer I'm
using kitten by Stila on my lid because
it's a really pretty champagne then I'm
using a medium brown color from The
Naked basics palette in my crease just
for some definition then I'm using a
more shimmery brown color just to spice
things up you know you know then I'm
using one of my favorite eyeliners of
all time which is just Stila stay all
day waterproof eyeliner it's just a
black liquid eyeliner then I'm using one
of my favorite mascaras which is
telescopic by L'Oreal and I think it's
one of the fancy kinds it's like L'Oreal
telescopic extended or something it's
like a cool brush but yeah it's just my
my favorite mascaras and then I'm using
some nude eyeliner on my what's it
called waterline just to brighten my
eyes and I really like the way this
looks a lot it really like opens up your
eyes that's from Rimmel and then this
lipgloss is from Sephora it's by soaping
Glory and it's like one thing it's what
it's called so kind of like burns your
lips little then I'm using one my
favorite highlighters from Mac and it's
in soft and gentle then I'm using some
makeup finishing spray it's called all
nighter from Urban Decay i almost said
urban outfitters with that Gretchen now
I'm just brushing my hair and I'm using
some feet protectant
I think it's just from like Paul
Mitchell or something and I keep
brushing my hair out and you saw me curl
my hair in one of my last few videos
curl not curl straighten gosh it's late
okay I'm straightening my hair and I
really do not do this in any specific
way I just kind of straighten pieces
here and there my hair is naturally not
too too curly so I just do it until it
is very straight just like this just how
I want it and yeah that's pretty much it
it's not too hard to straighten your
hair it's pretty basic and my tank top
and sweat pants aren't really gonna cut
it for the track so I picked up my
favorite Brown sandals from Target and
my maxi dress believe it or not
from Abercrombie I couldn't believe it
when I found it I feel like they usually
don't really sell dresses like that is
that just thinking that I don't know but
it's just this really pretty white with
lace maxi dress and as as you can see
some cool like lace details and I really
really love it and that is my makeup
it's a little bit more than I usually
wear then I'm grabbing my Dolce and
Gabanna light blue perfume and it's also
one of my favorites with my Tiffany
charm necklace and I gotta put on all my
Alex and Aziz I just throw on a bunch
then my bag is from brandy melville it's
just a fringy bag and I am all set and
ready to go for the track I had so much
fun and thank you so much brought you I
will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
