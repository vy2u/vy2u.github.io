confident with my skin I've always liked
to take on makeup and try to cover up
but recently I've been going for more
natural look and I realized it's okay to
have flaws and let them show through
because they make you unique so as you
can see I'm not wearing too much makeup
nowadays but I still like to have a
routine to take it all off so here it is
first I'm just putting my hair up in a
bun to make sure if my hair is out of
the way for when I wash my face and
brush my teeth in recently I've been
trying out the claritin a three-step
acne treatment it's sold online as for
I'll have it linked down below so you
can check it out and right now I'm just
using the foaming facial cleanser and
I've been liking this a lot
and now I'm just using the clarifying
toner and I've really been liking this a
lot a lot because I've been looking for
a really good toner for a while and this
one I noticed is really good it actually
helps to clean my skin out really well
even after the cleanser because you can
always tell this um makeup is left over
but this really makes sure your skin is
squeaky clean and ready for some
moisturizer so I'm going to be using the
acne lotion but they also have a
separate lotion you can get for
sensitive skin it's more like sulfur
based and it's gonna be a lot more
gentle on your skin when my skin isn't
really that sensitive so I just use the
more intense one and then now I'm just
brushing my teeth I just showed you my
toothbrush and toothpaste in case you're
interested I use crest 3d white
toothpaste and just I think it's just
like an oral-b toothbrush nothing too
fancy
this is kind of like two girls to show
what I like to floss my teeth a lot
because I just think of that
we're in so I'm using one of those
little flaw specs and now I'm just using
this little mini sample I have of an
Estee Lauder kind of under eye
moisturizer it's a clock oh yeah I cream
now I'm just using this fresh sugar lip
balm that I got at Sephora and I just
have the normal Brown like plain kind so
that is all I do
to kids unready and I just take my hair
out of my fun kind of let it loose so I
can go to bed I put on some comfy
clothes and don't forget I'll have all
the products that I use in today's video
links down below so you can check them
out if interested in that it's all
thanks so much for watching and I'll see
my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
