my alarm rudely awakened it is so so
early 5:15 is like so early for school
but that is when I get up so I'm usually
pretty sleepy and kind of play around
before I actually make my way to my
bathroom but the first thing I'm doing
is just brushing my hair out of my face
or when I brush my teeth and is it just
me or is it kind of weird to like film
yourself brushing your teeth I don't
know why I just like feel really weird
about it but there's me just brushing my
teeth and I like don't wash my face in
the morning I just rinse it off with
water so I just realized that what works
best for my skin then I am moisturizing
my skin before I start straightening my
hair I'm just brushing it out using some
heat protectant and I think I've shown
myself like straighten my hair so much
recently like in all my videos but um
here's me just straightening my hair
again and I actually decided to be fancy
and like section it off for the first
day so I could get it really really
straight but I usually just don't
section it off but I decided to for this
first day just to get it really straight
and yeah that's just me straightening my
hair I like what I do stuff to my hair I
just think it looks better so usually I
will curl it or straighten it and I've
been straining it a lot recently and
also do you guys think my hair's got any
longer key like comment down below I
feel like it's gone a little bit longer
and if you tell me it looks longer I'll
be happy because I want it to be long
again um yeah I was so long hair but now
I'm just putting some Moroccan oil in
the ends of my hair to make it a little
bit softer because it gets kind of dry
from using heat on it then I'm just
pulling it back and here's like an
overview of my makeup so if I miss any
product I will link them down below but
now I'm using benefits Porefessional on
my face just prime my face for some
foundation and this is just some random
foundation that I found in my vanity
I believe it's covergirl it was just one
that I noticed would match me because
I'm pretty dark right now from the
summer so I just found like the darkest
foundation I could I usually don't wear
liquid foundation I just wanted to for
the first day now I'm using some
under-eye concealer
garnier I believe it's like an eye
roller it's good for like correcting
dark circles I decided to wear eye
shadow so I'm using some Maybelline
cream eye shadows just as like a base
and like bringing it down below the eye
lash line yep and then I'm using Urban
Decay's Naked palette on my lid I'm
using sin and smog which is the like
light color in the dark color then I'm
just curling my eyelashes and using the
liquid eyeliner that I use like every
single day if the Stila black like
waterproof stay all day you know
you know I say it all the time and I
don't know if you're like a lot to do
that but I kind of dragged it down below
because I like the way it looks when
there's like some eyeliner on the bottom
too
then I'm just doing my mascara which you
guys should know it is L'Oreal
telescopic which is like my favorite
favorite favorite it's the only one I'll
use and I'm using some like nude
eyeliner just to line my waterline just
kind of like brighten up and open my
eyes a little bit more then I'm using
some bare minerals on top which is
really really dark it's actually in the
shade medium tan it's pretty dark and
but yeah that's just what matches me now
and I'm using some eye concealer which
is benefits fake up concealer just to
conceal those under-eye circles and now
I'm putting on some lip balm which was
just some Vaseline I think in the cocoa
butter flavor because it smells so good
and it works really good then I'm using
Too Faced uhm some bronzer on my
cheekbones and my forehead just in the
global three then I use NARS orgasm on
my cheeks because I one of my favorite
blushes and this is just an overview of
my makeup um it's like pretty much what
I normally do except for you a little
bit more foundation than normal and some
eye shadow so that is that and a
spiritual swept hands is not really good
for the first day of school not what I'm
going for
so I decided to go with this romper from
Urban Outfitters that's cream-colored oh
and then I put on my favorite perfume
which is Dolce and Gabbana's like blue
and then my outside Anees and my
necklace is from American Apparel Justin
just got for me recently this is really
pretty just like turquoise little circle
and I love that romper because it's like
cold-shoulder so yeah that is what I
will
mmm God if I honestly can't believe I'm
a senior I literally remember filming
this like last year on the first day of
junior year I was like can't believe I'm
a junior for anyone that's like in high
school or echoing in high school
whatever I would say juniors like by far
the hardest like senior year isn't gonna
be easy like I'm taking like ap bio and
like ap economics like all that I got my
thing Junior's the hardest and yeah I
just come home from my first day of
senior year and it just feels so weird
to be a senior and to be like the oldest
one in the building like it honestly
doesn't feel real I don't know but yeah
I'm just gonna throw this in here at the
end of my getting ready video I hope you
enjoyed it's pretty much like what I
normally do except for I like put on eye
shadow because I was like it's first-day
brush any better wear slash shadow now
at home and I'm just gonna get ready for
crew practice so yeah I hope you enjoyed
my video and I will see you in my next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
