video that I'm actually really excited
to film I was like going to sleep last
night and I was just thinking about it
because if any of you have boyfriends or
just got friends brothers uncles fathers
I feel like for girls to get guys
presents it's always just like harder
they're kind of harder to shop for them
like girls I don't know if that's just
me so I thought I would show you some
gift ideas for boys because I always
have trouble with that I'm just going to
show you some gift ideas that you can
get for your boyfriend got a friend
brother whatever and excuse me I just
came from practice so that's why I have
absolutely no makeup on my hands in
ponytail wearing a tank top today is
actually Valentine's Day I know it's too
late to like get presents for
Valentine's Day for like your boyfriend
or whatever but maybe for their birthday
but yeah let's just get into it
so the first idea I have is this little
tumblr mug thing I would call and Lucy
and I just thought of this idea and
we've seen like pictures on tumblr and
Pinterest and stuff like inspirations
and you can basically get like any kind
of draw or maybe like a water bottle if
they like water bottles and you can just
fill it up with whatever you want we did
it peanut M&amp;amp;Ms some greasy hearts some
peanut butter M&amp;amp;Ms and there's also some
yogurt covered pretzels of yogurt
Wednesday's so good and I know Justin
likes those a lot and then you can just
act like whatever you are on the front
if you want like a little card or
something
I just wrote two jaybo from GLB happy
Valentine's Day because I call him J Bo
and I'm Jo B and then we just did some
pink like tissue paper on the top and a
bow so yeah I think this one's like
really cute and they can use this after
for like or any drinks they want and
they can just eat the candy if they like
candy Justin loves candy so this is like
perfect for him if they have a sweet
tooth I just thought this idea was like
really creative and it looks really cute
too this is actually what I meant
getting Justin for Valentine's Day it's
on a Lululemon bag it's kind
like an inside joke we always like say
Lululemon I don't know why it's weird
you can also get them at stuffed animals
if they're like younger or if they still
like stuffed animals like obviously just
in 17 but he like stuffed animals so I
got him this cute little monkey because
he loves monkeys and it says be mine but
like obviously if it's not Valentine's
Day you can get like any of their
favorite animals like your stuffed
animal
because who at heart doesn't really love
a good stuffed animal and I know like a
lot of guys do even if they don't say
they do they probably do it especially
if it's coming from their girlfriend and
then I just snuck a little gift card in
there so that's my next idea is you can
give them gift cards which I know isn't
as like heartfelt but who doesn't love a
good gift card especially if it's for a
place that you guys go together like
this is for Chipotle no soon I will go
to Chipotle sometimes so it's kind of a
present for yourself too because then
they can spend it on you no just kidding
but yeah gift cards are always good
because you know they'll use them and I
feel like another good one is just food
like you can never go wrong with food
and Justin loves candy so I just got him
a bunch of his favorite candy these are
like sour patch extremes and sour patch
watermelons these are sour patch Dom
which if you haven't tried these like
they're so good try those and that's
look another idea you can get gum like
everyone loves gum yeah like getting
practical gifts that people will use
because you don't want to get them
random stuff that they're like not gonna
use you know I have to get this little
box of cheese it's like look it's so
mini and so cute so if there's like
certain foods or like snacks they like
you can just like throw it in there cuz
I think that's like a good idea and then
more candy because well you really don't
have to get your guy this much candy but
just another like skinny so these are
some sweet tarts and skittles and some
nerds too because he really likes candy
so there's that and then more like
normal gifts is you can get them like
athletic apparel which I find is good
because I'm not I feel like it's hard to
get them like normal clothes you don't
know if they'll like it or if they'll
wear it but if your guy looks like dress
up a lot or something you could probably
get him like really nice clothes I just
stuck with this Lululemon shirt because
like again like I said we kind of I
don't know we always talked about
women so it's kind of like an inside
joke so I just got him this gray shirt
from Lululemon and you can never go
wrong because a lot of guys are athletic
games will wear this you know and then
these I just thought were cute because
it's Valentine's Day so I got in boxers
with a bunch of hearts on it I think
boxers are a really good idea too or I
didn't get him socks but a lot of times
for like holidays and softball game
socks because guys always wear socks and
especially fun fuzzy ones or whatever
like they like them just like girls data
so you can definitely get socks I always
think is a good idea and like boxers to
you because guys wear boxers obviously
and then in my last idea I actually left
upstairs but it's a hat it knits like a
monkey because he likes monkeys so
another idea I have is if you give them
a hat especially if it's like wintertime
because I like what your hats like I
think accessories are always a good way
to go like every guy is different so
it's kind of hard but those are just
some ones I have for like maybe like
younger guys like teenage guys you can't
really get them like more manly stuff
you know like you're not gonna get your
17 year old boyfriend Hardware tools
like my mom will get my dad saw as a
golf clubs you know what I mean DIY
anything like that little tumblr mother
I had fill it with candy I don't like
effort anyway like care and I think it's
like cute looking you can never go wrong
with food don't forget that you can get
a bunch of candy and they're like
favorite food also you can like take
them out to dinner if you want to it's
always fun who doesn't go out to dinner
I would be careful with clothes you
think they'll wear because they might
not like it but you can definitely go
with let it close or anything gift cards
are definitely the way to go to because
they will definitely use them and
stuffed animals
everyone's a child at heart and who
doesn't love a good stuffed animal well
I just thought this would be a good idea
because I feel like girls always
struggle with what to get their guys and
I just thought I would share with you
some ideas yeah that's basically all my
ideas and if you have any video requests
that you want you can leave them down
below and is so much
like I didn't make a tumblr Gretchen
loves beauty with two eyes that
tumblr.com
so definitely follow me yeah thank you
so much for watching and I will see you
next video happy Valentine's Day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
