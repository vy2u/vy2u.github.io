on this episode of girlcode' get your
hands at 10 and 2 we're talking about
driving then it happens to all of us
we're talking about feeling fat but
first it's time to Bob and leave and
we're not talking about hair girl fights
can be anything from a screaming match
to a fist fight to mental warfare or
it's all in our heads
it's a lot of bickering bickering
bickering bickerings and someone gets
really hurt and it becomes really
dramatic and then all over flock of just
come and throw like parties and girls
fights because we all just want a little
drama we want our lives to emulate
movies or I do you know a girl is pissed
off angry when she's doing this when she
talks like she's not carrying the booth
like you don't even know like this is
your fault you aren't to blame I'm not
to blame this is you everybody's mama is
off-limits
girl fight through a lot like this like
puppy dog slapping or some hair pulling
or you go for the earring it's pretty
effective I'm used to the windmill it's
like a windmill thing protect your face
you gotta learn how to duck bottom me if
you don't know how to do a lot of this
you got to know how to do a lot of this
you can go for the punch just know that
you're gonna feel it back ow
Newton's third law states that every
action has an equal and opposite
reaction so when I hit Gretchen the same
force with which I hit her arm her arm
also hit me which is why I heard both of
us when I punched her
sometimes when I ask a question fyssas
class I tear up a little is that weird
and now it's a topic that makes you want
to lose it
we're talking about weight girls are
completely and utterly obsessed with
weight gaining it losing it everything
about it there's this perception that if
we put a person into size eight from
America that the whole country's gonna
projectile vomit we live in a fudged up
society it's so fun stuff the pressure
we put on appearance there's this whole
thing where like you want to be thin you
want to be pretty but for me my weight
goes straight to my thighs what when I
was born I was so small do you know what
I mean I would like 8 pounds 8 pounds
and ever since then I have to get back
to that way it's been nothing but
waiting if you're gaining weight and you
want to stop girls try dieting I had a
client so total clients doesn't sound
like a cleanse it sounds like you're
starving yourself I'm like when am I
gonna get a cheeseburger I want that
cheeseburger I only have 500 calories
that cheeseburgers 700 calories I can
eat that cheeseburger most people don't
want to hear about your diet just shut
up and eat your lettuce and be sad if
you're like me and you actually food try
it in the gym you want to get some booty
at the gym like walk through I stopped
going to the gym when I almost fall off
the treadmill twice first I kind of
almost fell off in the second time I
just wiped out and a very cute guy came
to help me up and I like don't know shut
it down shut it down shut it down I
don't go to the gym anymore so when I
feel fat I just decreased my normal
force
Gretchen I feel so bad how I'm sure it's
not that bad
does this look not that bad to you oh
well Ellen let's just take a ride down
on the elevator you can step on the
scale and you'll feel much better are
you sure yeah trust me hey go win down
this is an elevator problem first I'll
start off by drawing a Freebody diagram
they start representing the mass of the
person this downward arrow showing mass
times gravity mg and the force of
tension upwards the net force equals
mass times acceleration which is the
force of tension minus the force of
gravity which is really just the weight
in the elevator
Amelia initially accelerates downwards
until returning to a constant velocity
this causes her weight to register less
from 148 to 137 in a moment as seen here
then returning to her constant negative
velocity this scale reads 148 pounds
because she is affected only by the
negative 98 m/s squared acceleration of
gravity when the elevator stops at the
bottom amelia is momentarily being
pushed into the scale causing the scale
to shut up 160 pounds instead of 148
when we get even numbers for homework I
can't and now we're breaking down
driving to be a good driver you have to
be focused and you have to know all the
signs which they
I just hit so much like doof doof doof
and
off-budget guys have created the myth
that girls are bad drivers but we can
track just as well and we can multi-task
we can do our makeup text drink our
coffee and drive all at the same time
what should you keep in your car well
every girl should have at least an
outfit in your car
toothbrush regular brush lipgloss
textbooks water bottles a little bit of
everything
pick your closet when you were running
late never underestimate what you can
get done in the car I do my makeup in
the car
I brush my teeth in the car I brushed my
hair in the car I practice in the car I
can get dressed in the car I can even
touch up my roots in the car and be fine
with it
to bring it to you cabbages
Newton's first law states that an object
in motion tends to stay in motion while
an object at rest tends to stay at rest
unless acted upon by an outside force
yeah so when we were in the car get the
car all right we're in the car the car
is going at a constant velocity and we
independently inside the car are also
going at that velocity when the car
stops however we keep going because of
inertia and that's why I'm Caroline
that's stuff for me and that's it for
this episode of girlcode' thanks for
watching
partner the reason girls fight is
because this is all natural could be I
think 2013 we can do our make up text I
was messing circuit drive
excuse me ma'am how much time do I have
left
doc how much time - I uh - two one two
weeks two hours two days two months two
years process get me the ice chips</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
