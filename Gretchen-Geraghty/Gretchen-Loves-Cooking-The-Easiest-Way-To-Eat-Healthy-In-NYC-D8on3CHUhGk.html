we have a really fun night plan I'm so
excited
Caroline so we are having a really fun
nice cooking experience and I just
thought I would share with you guys but
I mean I just got back from Seoul's like
always explains my new shirt and we're
just not really fun with this video so
don't take anything too seriously
because we're just having a good time
money money basically this video is
gonna be me Addie turning things off
them actually good all right
first we beans broccoli sugar we boil
potatoes first
yes begin with the broccoli all right
now we are putting broth lambs pan and
the potatoes really tighten they're
going to go in there so we have like
only two burners and then the chicken is
going to go there so we can all cook at
one and it's like a toaster oven so it's
like an oven so you can roast your
broccoli and we should move this out of
the mouth here you need the fatty
potatoes are boiling Momo specific oil
is there yes
trouble it's great yeah it's great right
yeah okay close your eye shape oh it's
yellow hurt can we try at home good run
it's red wait what I am a super taster
you know the guards the rain song come
clean yeah yeah back to the beginning
you really mapped out there go let the
rain fall down and print my dreams let
it wash yeah I make it my best side I'll
paint it I can get up oh this is going
to be swimmin to help us look at this
format oven is the pattern what I'm
gonna do
oh yeah yeah yeah push up Boyardee it in
the house she's Leo to be matzah stuff
you're scared of a husband want me to
talk no no pop it back here for the one
we know I wanted with the dirty skittles
goodbye goodbye jalapeno is okay
are we sure yes I don't trust trust no
skittle trust no scandals is it Peter
Chao will do the cowbell yeah how about
this box we're watching yeah look
watching those are just the worst
dancers I've ever seen my whole life in
this video we're using all food from
hellofresh which is so exciting because
I think it's such a good idea
for kids like us that are in college and
just really busy and have a hard time
like shopping especially like in New
York City so it's so convenient and nice
just to get food sent to you that's
what's really healthy and obviously
fresh that you can just click yourself
and it's less than ten dollars a meal so
for $30 off your first week of
deliveries visit hellofresh comm and
enter Gretchen loves beauty 30 when you
subscribe thank you so much hello fresh
for sponsoring this video I think it's
such an amazing company that can send
like fresh ingredients that are actually
measured to be exact quantities you'll
need so that there's no food leads to
people that maybe don't have time such
as healthy and I think it's so important
that people are focusing on eating
healthy in today's day and age so
basically I'm really excited to try it
because hellofresh just makes it so fun
that you can like focus on the
experience feel like obviously we're
having so much fun filming and just
cooking together and it's so nice as
obviously as you can tell there's like
step by step instructions so that we
know we're doing because we're all
really bad at cooking and it only takes
like 30 minutes so it's like so
convenient living in the city or
shopping is honestly like the hardest
thing here that's what I've learned so
we're doing the pan seared garlic
chicken which I picked out because I
just like ash Tibbals and chicken and
stuff like experience plain in normal
and Larry's potatoes there's like all
the ingredients that come with it
good oh how do you even do that
open it on the first feeling sorry sir
you are the stewards I get it took you
oh look at those oh this is a good one
drop it potatoes are darling
chickens going curves go pick a good
distance hey guys look
kill myself here I'll burn it is right
there it's probably fun we all fire love

quickly into Sam cooking in us I gotta
be make it move metal sometimes I'm
gonna have you lose younger dude you put
your hands like a bridge and then you
