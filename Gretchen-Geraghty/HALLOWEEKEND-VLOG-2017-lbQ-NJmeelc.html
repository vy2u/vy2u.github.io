totally honest I literally did not work
out last week once the case I was just
so busy and sometimes you just have
those weeks where each 711 point things
which I don't like because I like
prioritizing working out but everybody's
team in it so I just want to tell you
guys that I feel like II think I'm like
a superhuman if you want common space in
Gretchen's lives for the two hours and
then goes to Seoul which I do sometimes
but sometimes you need weeks till I
could catch up and recuperate so we're
going to a gym I'm sorry I was really
bad at blogging this weekend and UVM I
just like kind of wasn't really focused
on vlogging it was just like hanging out
Janna and Ho another thing I want to
mention is I keep getting emails where
people won't take my survey for my
business core group and I appreciate it
so much we actually finished doing our
surveys because we got so many emails
and people that were willing to take our
survey so thank you so much I really
appreciate so much you guys are the best
because we would have been able to do
without you but if no one applies to
your emails like if you're setting them

surveys but nonetheless like we
appreciate your time and your efforts so
much because it's like so so helpful for
us there's heart of it thank you for
that
