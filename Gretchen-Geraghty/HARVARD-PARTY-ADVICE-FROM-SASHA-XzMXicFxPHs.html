still morning and that weird
11:43 tailor minute my resume for
internships okay I forget what it's
called but it's like oh she said it was
like um fashion something and they like
a look where the Victoria's Secret
Fashion Show and I'm like gold that's
only the coolest thing ever
so you guys yeah games on me no days off
I can tell them that me and that went to
discussion and we got there like three
minutes before the class ended so that
was funny as I tell them the Barney's
week and there's a lot to do today so a
little time I have three classes I'm
gonna go back in forth between question
West Campus like four times today but
that's okay
I'm gonna come back because my oh my god
I can tell that I think I know that we
can't walk there but I can tell them
that um the same me you're meeting Mila
Kunis tomorrow which is gonna be the
coolest thing ever
Harvard and I'll talk more later
oh yeah so my nails are gross I should
get them done yours look so that is I am
see I peeled off my auntie because they
settle bothering me I know it cut
through my nails of ruin or now because
it hurts so bad but we will see we love
waiting I literally know the people here
so well they like know our names I think
Sasha was just telling me how he doesn't
care about anyone or what they think
anyone good life lesson is it's 2018 but
no people are you notice that you if you
take a step back come people are very
rude in song don't be rude to people and
if people are being rude don't take any
more 2018 it's too much fake in this
world and in the truth either life we
also put that yeah do you want to tell
them what you're getting me when I get a
four oh no you know not until you figure
out what you're getting me so that's all
you have to pick it I pick mine we'll
figure it out see a piece to our own
okay bye
guessing my talking squashes marry me I
just got back from class and it is
actually already 6:40 because my
Wednesday's are just so hectic here at
BU well I mean it could be a lot worse
that my friends are pre-med I feel you
but I know I showed a new vlog recently
guys look what we got me and my
roommate's get so excited when our hello
fresh stuff comes in and we're actually
making two tonight instead of just one
because we're like that hungry and it's
gonna be me and a game
and then Lucy's coming those are the
chips that I was cheating and eating but
I don't even have to eat anymore because
what I like so much about these guys is
that they take so quick to make like
literally this will take us like 30
minutes and if you guys want to get a
Hello fresh like me and my roommates in
college because it's really fun and just
super convenient you can use Gretchen
loves at beauty 30 for 30 dollars off
your first week of deliveries did you
tell them until you use hellofresh
Meghan yes it is so good ten out of ten
would recommend and out of ten another
thing what me and my roommates like so
much about Halle fresh is that we can
pick our delivery day for when food gets
delivered because we're like so busy and
we were just thinking how we like really
conflicting schedules like when some of
us get home the other ones are leaving
and we're always just like willy-nilly
like you know like even Taylor and Amy
can't even eat with those right now
because they have to go do homework
whatever basically our lives are very
hectic so it's really nice but hella
fresh that you can choose your delivery
date so that it gets delivered when
you're there and able to get your box
another thing that mean Megan love so
much about hellofresh is I mean
obviously with her being on crutches she
just got her labrum repaired her second
one so it's when I said we don't have to
worry about meal planning or the grocery
shopping for the week because it just
got that much easier and we really look
forward it to and getting our hella
fresh box so that we can be excited to
cook on there okay in here like it's
always so much fun we make them you know
yeah whenever we make dinner together
it's always like it's so much better
yeah and I can make it together it's
like so sad when you're like oh I know
we're like okay where's that dinner time
alone and you sit at the table and it's
quiet and you're like okay well I know
it's gonna be so fun wait this is
cooking with Abby and Gretchen they have
classic family and they have veggie and
we always get veggie cuz we just like
you to like plant base you know
hard-looking oh goodness loves when then
we have these crispy little tops which
we thought we burned but they're
actually like the main things ever is
there oh my god
no we literally should just make crispy
what's your they're just actually
avocado tips I was Miss America's tips
we have our little pitas with our little
sauce we made they Megan actually had
this one before and it I would say it's
probably one of our favorites me and
Megan and Taylor it
so good VP I know the elevator took
forever when you're on the oh we don't
even I don't say what Foreman but when
you're on that what takes forever Thank
You Lucy your boob just looked so big
just now I know what the heck oh my god
what are those it's so earlier in the
over I briefly mentioned that we had
like exciting news for smarter you like
my pants yes I love them they're like so
cloudy music from brandy guys they look
good on everyone get them except they're
too short of me but I with blue sky
tonight pull them down like when I'm
with your feet yeah I missed you so I
came to Melissa York cause she's trying
on those dresses but the reason she's
trying on those dresses because Lucy me
we're not allowed to film or take photos
in Harvard video I appreciate criticism
I took it down because I didn't want
people to have the wrong idea about me
the tour guide that was in the video
that everyone says I was really rude to
actually emailed me a week after I
posted the video when he was still on
the internet and said hey my friends
just showed me this video at first I
thought you were like a complete loser
and just rude whatever because that's
how the video kind of betrayed me but
then he was like me and all my friends
like heavens watch like all of your
videos and we love them and we're like
your biggest fans and I was like okay
that was like a big turn he's in the
Hasty Pudding theatricals
I heard very much I didn't know about
like I haven't heard of before I've
heard it's like oh my god that's so cool
like they like know about it like I
guess it's like well-known and it's like
one of the oldest like theatrical groups

guess tomorrow's Thursday and he invited
us to this event with Mila Kunis guys I
was freaking out when he told me I was
