these they're good for like stacking and
then I got this gold bracelet and it's
like multi-coloured and I really thought
I had the wanted this at first like it
was all like trendy but now it kind of
looks like a child's bracelet almost
like rainbow curse crafts you haven't

will try to work that out
after the exciting part brandy melville

brandy melville because I've never had a
good one in my channel and I know this
is really little but I'm sorry like all
the money that I had I just spent on
this camera but we did get you guys one
thing that we'll show at the end so the
first thing is this black muscle tank
and it has a ribcage how long have I
wanted this I seriously every time I see
something I'm something like let's see I
need it and it's always out of stock and
I saw it and I was like I gotta get it
quick before it's gone and I think it's
called like the K tank and it just has a
ribcage and so it's horrible
oh yeah the ribcage has like floral in
it too which is like really cool and I
just love it so much and the next shirt
I got is this long-sleeve shirt and it's
just black and white stripes and it's
really slouchy and almost looks like
grey just from up here but if you exhume
it in closer it's like black and white
stripes and it's really flowy and
comfortable and like stretchy and soft
like that's like all their shirts are
like this and it's really key we'll see
me got these shirts I got them furlings
both of us so we can be little twins cuz
for twins
they say stay weird and they're like
this oh oh obviously they take my side
on - I like didn't say that but they're
like really cool it's like something
different they're just like the croft
stretchy shirt yeah oh and that'll bring
me into my next shirt that I got I got
this and this I wanted for the longest
time - I saw it the first time it came
out on brandy melville website like
maybe like a month ago and I saw like on
the website and I was like I need this
in my life
and it's like um it's just like that
same kind of cut it's called like the
Carolina I think it's like a white crop
shirt and it has donuts on it and I
wanted this for so long I think it's
adorable and especially with like
high-waisted stuff like this yeah I just
love this to bits and it's so cute it
may look like really doughnut to make me
hungry yeah I just like this a lot
the next thing I got is this little crop
shirt it's gray and it's called the
Gisele top I know if you look on there
and it's just gray and it has a little
cap sleeves and it kind of like scoops
down in the back and it's at the perfect
little cop shirt and I actually got it
because we were named the white one and
don't be like fight for it all the time
like you wear it every day yeah that's
pretty and like a plain imagine this
