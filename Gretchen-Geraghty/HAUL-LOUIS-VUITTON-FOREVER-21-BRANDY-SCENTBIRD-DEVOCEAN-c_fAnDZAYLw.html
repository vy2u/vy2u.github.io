you stuff from is this place devoted to
the ocean and I'm gonna do a little like
unboxing segment because I still have
been taking it out of its package it's
been so hard for me not to open it yet
so I actually found devoted to the ocean
through their Instagram page which is
just devoted to the ocean I'm pretty
sure I'll have it right here they just
have such a cool Instagram so what I
found out is what I really loved about
their company which is that they donate
20% of their net profits to sea turtle
rescue and conservation which makes me
so happy cuz like I just love a cute
little sea turtles I just love these
like socially responsible brands that
donate and give back it just makes me so
happy
I literally can't wait to open this
package okay okay let's go do it and in
case I forget to say later on everything
I show from devoted to the ocean and
pretty much like everywhere else in this
whole video - I'll have it linked down

seriously so cute I can't so the first
thing I got is just this green tank top
that says devotion with a green little
turtle in the middle and I'm really
happy that it's green because turtles
are green enough and it says devote it
to the ocean it just keeps getting
better and better I love how they're
like wrapped up like this this is
seriously so adorable can you see I hope
it's not too bright then I just got this
light blue t-shirt with a white little
turtle right there so that way turtles

little turtle in the middle kind of it's
too bright like me holding it up this is

friends I'm a small on everything yeah
I could not wait for this this is just

hood and then it's just as beautiful
green like teal color with a little
turtle symbol right there all about
comfortable hoodies you guys who I like
pink this is just a pink tank top that
has like the same print on the front it
just says devotion with devoted to the
ocean and a little turtle and on the
back has a little turtle print in the
middle this is so cute I got a bunch of
jewelry which is wrapped like in plastic
in there and then these are like the
bags that just go with them you know I

bracelet and white turtle stone bracelet
and these I know from the morning tide
collection and it's just a ping bracelet
a blue bracelet and a green blaze
bracelet a pink blue oh my can I say
that's right it's just a pink bracelet a
blue bracelet and a green bracelet is
this video like too bright I'm like
feeling like I'm like very washed out I
don't know what's wrong with the
exposure right now wondering these cream
bracelets are like those these are from
the devoted to the sea turtles
collection and they're just all these
different shades of green and I just got
this white adjustable starfish bracelet
with a silver starfish term right there
this is just a blue adjustable turtle
bracelet with a silver turtle charm
this is just a hand-carved hibiscus
flower necklace so it's just like this
white little flower with like this yarn
right here so it goes like that Miss
bracelet is just an adjustable devotion
logo bracelet and it's just like this
coral band and in the last bracelets I
have to show you is just this a blue set
which is by far my favorite because I
just love blue and these are the devoted
to the ocean collection I really like
the way these could look like layered
with like even the bracelets I'm wearing
now like I said I just love everything I
got from it devotion I love their
company and the idea behind it so you
like this stuff I got from there
definitely it check it out down below
like I said it will be listed in the
description box alright then the next
thing I have to show you is just this
perfume and this is oh my gosh it smells
so good oh my gosh I can I'm wearing it
right now so basically what happened was
the other day Hannah you guys know like
my best friend Hannah she was over at my
house and I was like you smell so good
like what are you wearing and then she
had she actually had the whole perfume
bottle with her like in her bag
it from a dolce gabbana it's late in
pictures oh my gosh sorry if I just like
butchered that name like that's really
embarrassing that I even try to say it
but I will have it linked down below
because yeah I don't even know what to
say hey but it smells so good and like I
said it's from Dolce and Gabbana
and from Dolce Gabanna one of my
favorite perfumes ever is light blue so
I was like oh my gosh like it's soul
jinghuan it's even better and I just got
it from scent bird which is this
subscription service for perfume you can
get like a new perfume every month so
it's like so convenient and they just
send it to you and it's really nice as
it comes in this little portable
container but yeah so you just twist it
up and spray I'm gonna literally gonna
spray more myself right now look ah oh
my gosh look at the very least if you
don't get it just go and smell it like I
don't even know how to describe it it
just smells seriously so good and I
definitely recommend tempered because
like for me like I like changing my
perfumes like all the time and I always
find new favorites and stuff so it's
like so convenient to like just have
like little portable ones that I can
just start my bag and you can find so
many different ones on their website so
yeah I will have this link down below
definitely go check it out ok then I'm
kind of nervous to show you guys because
I feel like people are very opinionated
every which way I just went to New York
City with my cousin Mandy and it was so
fun and we went shopping and I just got
to things while we were there so the
first thing I have to show you is just
this white shirt from brandy melville
but this isn't what I was going to show
you I'm gonna show that in a bit um and
it just ties in the fact like that and
it's just really cute
cuz it's just like this simple white
color but it's just so pretty that it
like ties in the back like that so I'm
really into this tank top and then the
other thing I got from New York which
I'm scared to show you is just as I
wanted this Louie Vuitton bag I think
from the womb I'm not kidding ok maybe
not that one but I seriously wanted it
forever what I really really started
wanting it was when I went to Aruba
this past December so that was 7 months
ago like I've been thinking oh this bag
forever like even before that it's just
so pretty at this tan in gray like
checkered print and it's just beautiful
and my baby and what's funny is I always
thought that the one that I wanted was
the never full GM but then when I went
in the store and I like I told her I was
like I want the never full GM she took
it out and it was like massive and I was
like wait wait no
what I want so what I actually end up
getting was the mmm and it's just
beautiful just look at it just look at
my baby
basically the mm is just like the
perfect little tote bag size like that
it's just little bit on its the never
pull mm and it's just beautiful and I
love it and the insides like that I
still have closing in because I was just
using it yesterday and yeah it's just
beautiful the inside is beige and what's
funny is when I went to the Louboutin
store when I was in New York City I
didn't know if I was gonna get it and
then I was there and I was like okay
Gretchen look if you leave here without
it you're gonna be so sad so I got it
I'm just so happy and they actually this
limited-edition like light pink like
inside I'll insert a picture of it right
here cuz I took a picture cuz they
almost sold me on it like I was like wow
like I really like pink and then I was
like okay Gretchen like this is like
impulsive just to get the light pink
like you've always wanted the beige I
know it's the inside of the bag but you
still might be able to see the inside of
the bag like for it with like some
outfits you know and I'm like I don't
want the light pink to like clash
anything so I just like that it's like
very neutral and I think we'll go with
like every type of outfit and it
literally fits everything like it's
called the Never full but it really is
never full because I just feel like a
whole weekend of stuff in here the other
day and yeah I just love it and I think
I can find a link to it and link it down
below and don't judge me I know it's
expensive but I've been saving forever
it wasn't my parents money it's my own
money like yeah that's all I have to say
about it okay okay oh and then actually
these are from brandy melville to which
I didn't actually buy my friend Hannah
and gave them to me because I always
like to give her little presents cuz
like Hannah is just my best friend and a
lot of things like remind me of her so
like when I see stuff that's like oh my
god I like that Anna and I have to get
it for her and she's known that I wanted
these black Bodie shorts from pretty
mellow forever and I just keep like not
buying them and Lucy has them and Mandy
has them and I'm like I need them
they're so comfortable and cute and
she's a question I don't really mind
that much and she gave them to me so I'm
like oh my god yes Hannah thank you so
I'm actually buy these but she just got
me these at black booty shorts from
Randy Melville and they're so stretchy
and cute and comfy and I've always worn
Lucy's so I'm happy I have a pair of my
own and to pay her back I got her
another present which I'm so excited I
was able to do so I don't know if you
guys have heard of the website called
Lauren James and Hannah's the one that
actually told me about it because she
told me a while ago that she's been like
dying for this I think it's called a
peach comer or spirit jersey or no it's
called a Beachcomber but it reminds me
of like spirit jersey type shirts and
running this for everyone for so long
and it's always out of stock and then
the other day I went on there and I saw
that it wasn't so I snagged it for her
and she doesn't you know I got it from
yet so I'm so excited to surprise her
but yeah I just got Hannah this red
long-sleeve peach comer I think it's so
cute
and then just has this red and white
like stripe detail on the back at the
top so that's why it kind of reminds me
of a spirit jersey now because usually
spiritual Z's have like words up there
but that just has like a design and then
right there just says Lauren James with
a pocket so this is so cute and I really
like it and I'm really gonna surprise
her with it and then I got myself the
same one but in a different color and
this is just a gray one and I'm pretty
sure as I'm sail to like this one normal
price was like normally yeah they're
like 54 but them and when I got myself I
swear online it was like 30 something
like I think it's on sale so like so I'm
gonna go check it out it still is but
and if you like it of course and it's
just all grey and it says Lauren James
and has like blue detailing and it's so
comfy and cute and then I feel like
people will be very convenient about
this like some people will love it and
some people hate it look I know some of
my friends are just like very not preppy
people and they hate like preppy things
and some people aren't very preppy
obviously so anyway I just got this
white t-shirt and it says Lauren James
and pink and the back is so cute it just
looks like this and that's always signed
this has sweet tea bowties cotton
football pearls seersucker Derby so I
just thought that was like really cute
and it's just like this big comfy white
t-shirt I think Lauren James is like
really cool like it's really good for
people that are really preppy I wouldn't
consider myself like really preppy or
really not preppy I feel like I like
prepping things once in a while like for
people that have asked me my style like
fashion sense before like it's literally
like I just say like it's what I like
like I always change like I have some
sort of that's really preppy like I know
I look it's like Vineyard Vines like
ship dress that I love and like this is
obviously very preppy and then sometimes
I don't repeat stuff that much so it
literally just depends but that was in
this long rant but anyway I really like
those and the last place type to show
you stuff from is all from forever 21
but it's actually from the DOE app which
I literally talked about in so many haul
videos before but basically if you don't
know if you've been living under a rock
and haven't watched my other videos
dough is just this shopping app this
isn't sponsored right now it's like I
was about to say that because I'm like
it's just this app but like it really is
just this like shopping app and it's so
good because it's so convenient I get
like all my clothes
there now because you can like order
from all these different stores like all
the stores I shop at but like at once
because it's like oh one little app you
know so it's like so nice and if you use
the code Gretchen I'll put it right here
if you use the code question you will
get it basically like a five dollar gift
card to like any store on there like
there's like forever21 brandy melville
eight saw us Urban Outfitters Victoria's
Secret like literally everything and
also if it's like the first time you're
signing up and like ordering something I
get free shipping too so like if there's
something that you've been wanting from
those stores like you get five dollars
off and free shipping so like you're
welcome go ahead I just saved you money
yeah I just ordered from forever 21 and
actually I just remember the first thing
I got it's just this yellow shirt and
it's just this yellow crop top looks
like this and it's funny about this
shirt is I actually were a part of a
style whole photo shoot I was a part of
and I like loved it on set and then
afterwards those like posting photos
from there people were like where is it
prom and I like didn't know when I was
like meeh peels from forever 21 but I
think didn't really remember and I found
it on their website so I was like yes oh
my gosh and I just loved it and it's
really cheap too I'm pretty sure it
wasn't more than like fourteen or
fifteen bucks so definitely go check it
out I like I said I love it listed them
alone and then I also found it it's
literally the same cut but I just feel
like this type of crop top is so
flattering since it just like Criss
crosses like that in the front and I
just like that it's tan cuz it's neutral
and will go with a bunch and then I just
got this coral dress which is so funny
because if you guys like watch all my
videos or like watched all videos of
mine in the past you know that I hauled
this before and this is just this
beautiful coral dress with this
detailing right there and yeah I just
love it and I got this literally this
exact dress like a couple months ago in
the spring in the hall and I'm literally
gonna put in the Tryon of me wearing it
then so you can like see that it was
like back in my vu dorm like you see
like I got it like a while ago but I
actually had to buy in a size up because
when I bought that one they like fit me
but like barely like it was like really
tighter in my waist and I was like okay
I can like squish into this but I was
like and I was like not that comfortable
so I just figured like I'll just buy
another one and it size up and then I
gave that one to my friend Hanna
because she has like a skinnier race to
me she's literally so skinny
obviously I had to buy it again because
I think it's really cute and I like it
and I'm probably gonna wear to the track
tomorrow TBH oh my gosh I feel like this
whole videos been so long just because
I'm so chatty but yeah basically the
last thing I have to show you is your
sis the black long-sleeved bodycon dress
and it just has his rib detailing
like laces up in the front and I think
it looks so cute on and yeah I just
really like this Italy good for like
going out you know no I'm like kidding I
literally just like hang out with my dog
my twin sister every night but also I
realized this was only 59 me like is it
me or is that like so cheap especially
for like a full dress so yeah I
definitely go check those out down below
in definitely use my code crush into
like sign up for dough because like
literally I'm like saving you money girl

got in this haul video don't forget to
