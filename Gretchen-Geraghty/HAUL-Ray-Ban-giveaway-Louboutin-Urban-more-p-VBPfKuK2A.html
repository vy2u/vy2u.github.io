haul video for you guys I'm just been
getting the stuff over like the past
month and I'm just been waiting to show
it all to you guys so let's get on into
it and I'll just address the obvious as
you can tell by the title of the video
there is going to be a raving and
giveaway so just stay tuned till the end
of this video so I can tell you guys
about it so the first place I have to
show you guys that close from is a
necessary clothing it's also Stein it's
kind of out of my comfort zone and I was
like you know what catching you got a
branch oh you gotta try new clothes so
yeah I just picked up with some really
like trendy stuff or at least in my
opinion I didn't even know I'm talking
about they love necessary clothing like
every time I go to New York City and I'm
like you so how I go shopping there do
they have them anywhere but in your city
I don't know so I actually just ordered
all these online because I don't think
we have a store here your stuff I have
to show you is just this long-sleeve
like heathered gray one that has this
like white chiffon at the bottom like my
friend Taylor would really like this I
feel like I could just see her in it and
the next thing I got from a necessary
clothing is seriously so cute and I got
this oh my god I'm such a copier I saw
this on Instagram and a photo with like
a white short sleeve shirt under it's
just like very trendy I feel like again
like I don't really know what I'm
talking about I just like to see stuff
on Instagram and I'm like hey I should
do that that's cool the next shirt I got
is just so cool it is black short sleeve
shirt has all this like just stress
details on the front they're like little
holes and like laces up in the front as
you can tell okay than this I'm
literally such a copier like I said
before I got this specifically because
you guys know Jojo Fletcher like the
Bachelorette look you know she was I'm
been season and now she's like engaged
to Jordan anyway I like love her and I
think she's so cute I follow her on
Instagram and there's this one picture I
like sitting right here she's wearing a
long tan dress that's like spaghetti
strap and it's like neh and I just
always thought he was so cute look I
love that picture and I actually got the
shoes that she has in the picture like I
already have them so I was like retching
you have to get the dress too so you
could really copier and obviously I
don't know this is like the same one but
I thought it just looked just like it so
I literally got this just because of her
this is honestly my most favorite thing
in this haul video because you guys know
I have a bit dress it looks and just
like this button gray and I love it and
I wear all the time so this is just like
black and white stripes and it just ties
in the front like that and she's like a
teaser dress and he's your dresses are
my favorite thing to wear ever guys
because you don't have to measure it
with anything you just throw it on and
you were like good to go oh my gosh this
next thing I'm so excited for my friend
Noelle she has a
mash like long-sleeve a body suit like
this and I was obsessed with this so I'm
really happy I got this and you probably
put that Gretchen what are you gonna
wear that you can wear like cute like
bra let's underneath it that are
obviously like not see-through you know
so you don't have to see your boobs
anyway I just think it'll be so cute and
like you'd have to find the right time
and enjoy this I'm not gonna be going to
class miss no I just think it's really
cool and really exited like I said how
many times am I gonna say yeah in this
video oh this is really cool too I'm
just so excited about everything I got
because it's just so different than what
I already have and this is just a black
shirt sleeve shirt and it says like army
and then it's like cut out so it's like
a little like choker detail on the top
and the last thing I wasn't necessary
clothing is really funny they're just
some to keep in pads because you can
never have enough of those especially if
you're like me and you like wearing like
really revealing I'm just kidding but
just like plunging neckline tops and
like open back stuff like a lot of open
back stuff so I always have to wear like
sticky boob pads so yeah oh the next
thing I got I got this that I'm wearing
right now it's on from Brooks Brothers I
got it at a head of the Charles a
weekend or two ago and just hoc r4 head
of the Charles ricado
yep and I just like it it's just a
complete red sweatshirt but honestly way
over price the Brooks Brothers tent is
like so crazy like t-shirts are like 60
bucks and it's like I don't even want to
know how much it was I think it's like
80 or 90 oh it's so bad but you know
it's really cute and I don't have like
that many red things so anyway okay so
all the next up I'm going to show you is
from Urban Outfitters in Sephora and I
got it all through the apt oh and I know
I've talked about Jo a million times I
feel like I talked about it on my haul
videos I just have like share the word
with you guys because I love it so much
I always have to saying this but it's
not sponsored by doubt at all in this
video is literally not sponsored but I
just love the DOE shopping app it's so
amazing because you can get like all
your stuff from like urban and Sephora
it's on there and it's just so
convenient cuz you can like online shop
from all these different stores in one
app and just check out so we even like
remembers your credit card and
everything interesting purchase and it's
so quick and yeah I just love it it's so
convenient so I'll have it linked down
below and if you use my code it Gretchen
you can get five dollars off your first
order and free shipping so that's just
really amazing so I got three things
from Urban Outfitters and the first
thing is just this black tie and
necklace makes like suede as you can see
it on it like it's really cute and I
didn't really know how to wear it at
first you have to mess around with it
and it's all like versatile you can wear
it so many different ways guys if
you see my hell videos before like any
other the weeks I feel like I've talked
about this skirt so much I have this
exact skirt and like the taupe version
and I wear it constantly it's like my
go-to like fall outfit just with like a
cream sweater cuz I'm so basic but
basically I wear this her all the time
and I loved it and then of course this
always happens to me this is heaven do
you guys whenever I buy stuff from like
specifically Urban Outfitters but other
stores too like if there's like a new
arrival and I'm like oh my god it's so
cute and I buy even though it's way too
expensive because I'm like you deserve a
question like it's really cute and then
it goes on sale so this skirt I bought
the taupe one for like a ridiculous
amount like when I first came out
because I loved it and then make freakin
one on sale I was like kidding me the
good news is this I found on sale oh my
gosh I might still be on sale for you
guys you can get it and also like in
this haul video everything that I'm
showing you all have link down below if
I can find the links to it cuz I know
that's really helpful for you guys but I
just got it in like to the orange color
and it's like so fall in so cute and I
love it with the taupe skirt that I just
got in orange I would always wear with
this one cream sweater from Urban
Outfitters so I thought it was fitting
to just get the cream sweater in the
taupe color I'm like actually crazy you
guys do this like if you love like one
item you get it in like multiple colors
because that is just me okay I always
have to do that just a quality sweater
you know Charles what I have bourbon
Outfitters but like through dough like I
said you know and I from Sephora I just
got purity from philosophy this is like
one of my favorite face washes of all
time it's just like a really good
cleanser it smells so good it smells
like lemons like it's just amazing and
oh my gosh you guys remember I remember
getting this in the haul video like two
years ago and I went like this and it
like I just got scared literally sprayed
like the face washed like on vine nosed
you guys remember that video if any of
you watch that video you're like a true
subscriber like I remember you like day
one yes can't talk enough about it and
my favorite reason it's one of my
favorites
yes is that it takes off my makeup too I
mean I do change my cleansers a lot like
I have a bunch from Neutrogena this is
always a go-to and I will always find my
landing
community all right moving on just some
of the miscellaneous things I just
thought I would show you everything I
got in last month so I got these socks
basically long story short it's not even
one story me and my friend Noel were
going into its soul cycle and we were on
our way and I was like oh my gosh I
don't have socks what am I getting - she
was like you can probably buy them there
but they'll be really expensive and I'm
like yeah you're right I could probably
have some that are like a million
dollars on the way to SoulCycle we were
walking down Newberry and we were like
duh like there's socks on Newbery
there's like all these stores sweet ran
into Nike and I'm like I only need one
pair like I'll just buy one pair so I
just picked out it's just a pair it's
like running no show nike elite
cushioned that's where we went wrong I
don't even think the price tag was on
here oh it is I just didn't see it guys
they were 16 freakin dollars I'm like
why is one pair of ankle socks 16
dollars like maybe because they're cool
and they have this little thing on the
heel I don't even know which actually
okay honestly is helpful don't like when
I was running like it makes it so you
don't get like blisters on your nails
because the back of the sock light goes
up higher but these were sixteen dollars
and honestly it was crazy there they are
like really nice socks though so I mean
I guess I would recommend them if you
want to go spend $16 on socks I think of
my mom and dad see this picnic crunching
where did we go wrong and raising you
why did you buy $16 socks mom and dad I
love you I'm sorry I don't know kind of
them and then I ran into Sephora the
other day and I got this Kat Von D
lock-it foundation and I'm in the shade
light 45 and neutral in case you're
wondering have you just for like the
past weekend out and I just put it back
into packaging so I could show you it
but I've been loving this it's like
really good coverage and when I went
into the Sephora store I wasn't even
planning on getting it I just wanted to
get matched because I was gonna get it
on don't you know because they like
Sephora and they have like this on the
dope app and I just buy like everything
through dough cuz it's so great but I
got matched to it I was gonna leave and
then I saw the price and I was like oh
my gosh I was like wait this is only $35
and she was like yeah and I was like
what like I always assumed that it was
like 60 or something cuz it's like such
a good foundation and so full coverage
I've heard such good things about it and
I was like it's only 35 I'm just gonna
get it right now like heck so I just got
it and I've been loving it it's really
great so I would recommend and kind of
putting off filming this haul video
because I've been very and nervous to
show you one thing like
I don't know but okay the first thing I
got is just this shirt from brandy
melville and I got movies when I was in
New York City for beautycon so that was
like you know the weekend of like
October 1st I just got this really comfy
gray and navy blue with stripes like a
thermal type material I think it is just
so stretchy and comfy the last thing I
got is very much a splurge and a lot of
you probably want to Korea with it I
don't know I've just been scared to like
show you because I feel like I'm gonna
get a lot of like a negative feedback
and I've just been scared but okay I
wanted to use for someone these are
Louboutins and I know it's kind of crazy
it wasn't spur-of-the-moment like I've
been thinking about them for a while and
then I was like you know I'm in New York
City there's a Louboutin store here at
dawn fit bag like I just have to go I
just have to get them and it comes with
like this little red bag - oh I'm so
excited I was very specific and what I
wanted because I knew they had to be
ones that I would want to wear that I
really liked so that I would actually
wear them you know anything I knew I
wanted it black patent heels I knew I
wanted them to be rounded toe and I knew
I didn't want them to be one of the
crazy 4 inch 5 inch heels because
they're known for their like crazy like
stiletto like really really tall ones
you know but I knew I wanted them to be
like a little bit more practical so I
can wear them for like business about
wanted to and actually walk and I'm 95 9
so I didn't to be like 6 - you know what
I mean like I'm already so tall when I
wear heels so I didn't want to be like
crazy tall I know I wanted ones that
were between maybe two and a half in
like three and a half inches and these I
believe are right about three three and
a half inches and they're just the black
patent ones rounded toe and what are
they called so I can tell you new simple
pump bears like the name right there and
okay I'm a size 39 and a half so it's
really weird
usually I'm an eight or nine and a half
I think Louboutins just like run really
small actually think some Styles run
smaller than others I don't know but
these ones just in my case I felt
ran very small so I had to go a full
size up to thirty nine and a half and
seven thirty eight and a half and these
fit perfect and actually I wasn't
planning on getting these ones exactly I
was actually going to get the ones
without the little platform that were a
little bit cheaper they're actually Co
hundred dollars cheaper without the
platform but then the guy there was like
crotch in like if you want to be
comfortable when you're wearing these
like you need to get the ones at the
platform like it actually makes such a
difference which makes sense because
then like
the what is this called the pitch I
don't even know what I'm saying then
like the angle that your foot is like it
goes from like up more to like this so
it's like a lot more comfortable to walk
in when there's like a
form if it's like the same he'll hug you
don't I mean I was gonna get the one
without the platform but then he talked
me in to getting the one with the
platform and I haven't really worn them
like out yet but I like walked around in
them and try them on and stuff and
they're comfortable if I just things a
classic like a red bottom is just so
cool they just make me so happy you know
I bought them all with my own money like
I saved up so yeah I just really love
them and I don't want any mean comments
about them okay okay I just everybody's
in love now is what I'm gonna talk about
this sunglass issue I have issues with
the sunglasses whenever I go into
sunglass hut guys I think I've said this
in a blog before
I don't know what it is about sunglass
hut like whenever I step in there I
leave with a pair of sunglasses like I
physically will make myself not go or
like not walk by because I know if I go
away like draws me in and I was leave
with sunglasses this always happens so I
was on during the other day with my
friend
micaiah and I friend Anna and they're
like let's go to something I thought I
was the guys I can't go in there I'm
gonna leave with Mara sunglasses then I
come on guard like it's fine
and I leave with two pairs of Ravens
like what is it one of the people that
work there just really good in sales
like I don't know
so in last time if you're watching this
like your employees are really good
because they told me till there's a
Ravens like I know Mimi's but basically
the issue was and the reason I left with
two was that if some of you know these
little black aviators that I got before
they're just all black and these are
just like the classic 55 millimeter I
think in these aren't polarized because
when I got them back at home a year ago
would they didn't have the polarized
ones in the store they just had the
Doppler ease once I was like okay and I
got these and I liked them but then I
realized I have a really big head and I
didn't know that they came in like a
bigger size so then I've been wanting
like the bigger ones so then when I was
on Newbery out if you can like see the
difference but these are the 58 and
these I got polarized to sound like you
know what you're ready spinning like so
much money on them like might as well
get polarized ones so that it like helps
your eyes and the Sun you know and you
can like see better and it's like
doesn't make your eyes just tired I
don't know so then I just got these ones
but then I was like Gretchen like I
already had the all-black ones like and
I was looking at the black ones with
like the gold frames and the people they
were like you know what like the black
ones with the gold frames are like a
really different look like you could
even get both and I was like
hey I could so then I did so I got these
and I got these and they both came like
in the black cases so these are the to
it that I got a sunglass hut recently
but then she became your Gretchen you
literally have the same pair just not
full rides like in like the smaller
version you know I don't know if you can
tell they're like a little bit smaller
so I was like what am I gonna do with
these and then I was like I'll give them
away to you guys cuz I love you guys I
almost had two hundred thousand
subscribers you guys really cuz my
subscribers ever like I can't even tell
you you make my day I'm like BFFs with
all of you look I love you guys so not
that they're little I keep saying like
the little ones they're just like the
classic 55 millimeter ones they're good
on like everyone's head they're evenly
good on me you know like they sold okay
but I just like the way that your
sunglasses look and I have a very large
head fun fact when I was like 2 my head
was in the 95th percentile for like head
size and my doctor was worried about me
