little older drivers she was like ah my
heart I think you're so hyper right now
so that mean she's a golden retriever

college and I miss the most
lucy has been Bachmann's I was like the
mission of the day was what do you miss

comment because I told you my middle
name the other day you were like what's
Lucy's middle name I'm so curious to
know so what's your middle name Lou
Margaret so cute
tell them the story about our middle
names like Margaret is our dads mom's
name so that's that it's Lucy's no name
and my mom's mom's name is actually an
so so my middle name I think my middle
name was going to be and then my mom was
like that's like everyone's middle name
like my mom's middle name is Anne so
then there we have to give Gretchen like
a special one so then that's why my
middle name is Inga because that's my
problem over a chicken's name I'm pretty
sure and then what else was I gonna take
Oh one of you I'm running through my
comments right now and Hannah says my
best friend and I started calling each
other puppy because of you and Taylor

yeah we actually ate a lot for like
breakfast brunch but Lucy's always
hungry so my though

realized that cinnamon raisin and peanut
butter is related together which the
main reason is peanut butter

points for the semester because I used
all mine her anyway she still has lunch

I did some bicycling and didn't I feel
like I've mentioned that I like hate
bicycling a lot and I don't want to say

we're going to call my on impact at all
I have to go back to my room right now
and pack like crazy and they basically
her and David just taught me like a
whole unit of chemistry in a couple
hours I'm like I really did not pay as
much attention as I should have for
tomorrow's exam but I always pull it out
somehow I mentioned this in a vlog or
two ago I said that I was a good test
taker and someone like comment do
something really mean and they why don't
you brag a little more something I'm
like I just I mean it in the harmless
ways possible that I just I don't know I
just I'm a good test taker like
naturally I guess we're going home
tomorrow
I can't believe a crank arm still dances
it's gonna be great can i blog me
someone commented I was just naturally
so funny they're like it's just her
personality I'm like I know she's good
to have around so you naturally came out
of the womb yeah I came out looking like
a goodra
you are a hood rat good night miss so
was your mom
it's literally my memory
hey now we can talk in here because it's
the bathroom al-qaeda cells tonight -
these face and ask you I'm super excited
like I'm serious it makes you think your
face like feels so nice I was telling
Taylor okay so see you know see all
those little like black dots
that's like impurities that it like
pulls from your skin I don't that's at
least with the lady I support told me
and but like the big chunks of black are
just like pieces of charcoal that are
like kind of like exfoliating you know
and it starts off as like a black like
dark dark gray I guess so
I'm telling you it's your skin so nice
it's red because it's like exfoliator
but like no I think it's just because
like it like exfoliates your skin and I
pulls out the impurities but I swear it
no mine is actually very good but um can
any emergency I swear my pores by my
nose are smaller because I'm always
stressed that I like big pores my skin
looks actually very hurt right now but
yeah it's just like nice perfect you
wake up and like your skin it's like
sometimes like it feels really soft I
hope so
did you hear me did I say before no I
but but I gotta have a good one if
Sephora the lady put it on and I was
like not convinced and then I was like
better get it cuz my skin was so nice
after baby's bottom okay so we're
actually gonna another office right here
I just went over the fact that I deleted
the first clip today I'm really upset it
was will see laying in her bed and she
was like laughing and being cue and I
think this is rarely like she's really
outgoing and show emotion and blackness
but Lucy is intact a very
she just like you just have to like open
up her show yeah like how you around her
a lot so that's our camera she's kind of
like shy okay good night bug much day 16</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
