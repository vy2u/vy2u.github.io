be showing you at some home coming or
like date night dress ideas and all
these dresses are going to be from
Windsor I'm obsessed with them pretty
much all of these looks I just have my
straight long sleek hair because that's
just kind of like my go-to and then the
same jewelry because really I think the
jewelry that you're like most
comfortable and you should just continue
to wear and then this first dress is
this beautiful for a screen
fit-and-flare dress and I'm obsessed
with it I love the mesh on the back and
I love the shoes I paired with it it's
just these black tie up kind of strappy
heels and I wear them with all of the
dresses I've shown in this video since I
think they're so versatile they
literally go with everything obsessed
and then this black kind of quilted bag
with the change strap is so perfect for
like a date night or homecoming because
it's just small enough to fit your
essentials but not too big so you can
still dance the night away so then the
second outfit again same makeup is just
kind of like a bronzy eye and just kind
of like really flawless face with a
strong eyebrow that's what I would
recommend that's my favorite go to like
going out look and then this dress is so
beautiful guys it's just beautiful kind
of shiny silver sparkly dress a little
bit more fancy than the first one
depending on what homecoming date night
whatever event you may be going to this
might be a little more fancy attire and
then same bag so beautiful also from
winter and then my third dress is this
beautiful kind of crochet and mesh top
fit-and-flare little swing dress and I
love that it's so flowy on the bottom
because it just hugs you nice and tight
and snug on the top and then flows out
so it's so flattering in the back of the
Crossy strappy detail so people same
shoes same bag and then my fourth dress
is so beautiful it's kind of like a
two-piece dress I guess to bezel-set and
the long sleeve crochet lace top is so
beautiful I love that it's so sparkly
and glittery in the same bag and the
flowy out skirt just obviously is it the
same color beautiful blushed hand color
that goes with and then the same shoot
alright and then my last option
I think I actually will wear to my date
night or maybe even formal for a low fee
I think it's so beautiful so flattering
it's just beautiful like royal blue
shiny color comes between
maybe it's just this beautiful blue and
I again wear the same heels with it
because I just think they go with like
every dress are so strappy and beautiful
like look at how cute they are guys
