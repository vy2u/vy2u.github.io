because it's legal here so we went to
this place called Queen yeah it was when
the shomsul is it did I say that right
this is it and it was so cool like when
we were walking there is this Rama Tsui
there the name of the street and we were
walking down the street and I was like
yawn the Arctic Triomphe and it was so
pretty eyelid was like losing a minute
Carmen cry I thought he was like tearing
up when I was looking at it cuz it's
just like oh yeah I just saw the top of
the Eiffel Tower
I remember you saying member we wanted
to go I remember we walked by the Eiffel
Tower at 12:40 when we are going to
clean and you're like oh we have to wait
till one till you can see it sparkle
because he says every hour on the hour
for like 1000 at night for 10 minutes
for like 1 to 110 it sparkles and guys
guess where we're going right now
somewhere sad tell them what happened
so at Queen there was just ball pit and
it's really fun and I had snapshots of
it when I got my head hurts
um I knew brought her but Lucy may or
may not I guess I pushed her she pushed
me I guess I don't remember him
obviously when you're falling you catch
your fall and like my head like she said
she fell so deep through the ball pit
that her wrist hit the bottom of the
ball pit like the ground like I just
landed look at it
it's really swollen and she thinks it
might be broken so we're going not but
all right now hydrate hydrate fellas can
I show them your view or will everyone
come find you no one will find me Lulu
you're safe here
we actually have guards and stuff it's
so pretty guys I'm like obsessed with
what is it called the metro the tram I'm
obsessed with it because it's like the
tea but quicker and cleaner and nicer
and not dirty and so fun so Boston take
a hint
do this it was yeah it looks like your
skin is too small for the insides and
then this one has like a bone and like a
vein and like you can go like that than
that it's like where's your bone it's
hidden by all this moaning well isn't it
no is nobody spree no it's really swing
break it not that small you know my
fingertips are tingling
okay well that happens windows you know
because oh these are to entertain your
kids when you break your own or me
so guys the results are in and he just
goes I think it's broken
he pushes too hard and she was like how
he does up here much like up here but he
said that because of the x-ray we should
you like here and I was like gonna
scream I told you yesterday was freaking
you knew and but then I kept having to
do things like it got caught in my
sweatshirt when I was trying to achieve
all my blanket I want to see what you
have to look like I think you like know
things when things happen like Lucy
didn't knew that was broken she just
knew it you know I have a pen a high
pain tolerance and I was like for me to
feel pain right now
is like like I wasn't crying or anything
like it didn't like it just like oh gosh
I like literally this is as far back as
I can bend my hand like look it's
shaking I told Lucy that it'll be a
really cute accessory to have a cast
with her fancy after that no bleach I
was like doing why I'm trying to this is
like I'm trying to like that right now
do you what like big mirrors to like
that
oh you can't like move it are you she
kept saying you're young my fingers are
all tingly and that's what happens when
you break it because it messes up the
nerves okay um I was telling them that
your cast is gonna be a really cute
addition to your fancy outfit at Nobu
tomorrow you know take these shoes with
you and stand on your right side and put
my arm behind your belly that's oh
that's so smart you're so smart
now I broke with his rest everyone on my
phone sorry boo-boo because I just
realized Lucy keep it right it's my
right hand kitchen I made you write down
my addressing my phone number like what
did you think I had to write down the
answer right down here just like a
Monday night to write it down before it
I was like I feel so bad wait so did you
tell them exactly what happened
basically we're in the ball pit we're
just horsing around having fun the ball
is not that deep yes we were I was not
that deep because it's normally just
like a circular booth and they just fill
it with balls and I'm right thought is
really like I jumped into my feet at the
bottom and I just like fell so I
personally seen I guess I bet she said
why would she like filter the complete
ball pit in her hands like went to the
bottom to kind of like a cure and so now
her sister didn't really have you can't
like drink with that squeeze anything
heavy it's so pretty
wait what's the hurry on
we're lost we're trying to sign the
orthopedic surgeon you're going hey
don't swear and it doesn't work right
now I don't have a side because in case
you don't know I think I said yesterday
but in case you forgot Lucy Stone got
stolen so we only have mine but mine
doesn't have a pair of SIM card so I
don't have service so it only works on
my thigh so we're stuck in time the
orthopedic surgeon Lucy's ribs so she
can get the cat and we'll see if she
needs like surgery or anything
hopefully not hi booboo we just got
blumenbach X and I got one too and what
else we get oh I got a gingerbread guy
yesterday they yelled at me for filming
but we are at a different fall
and he's really nice cool baguette make
you feel better
yep
some oh my god their bodies filled up
everyone coming appalled when you come
to Paris
guys it's orthopedic orthopedic right
doctor place is so cool look at look at
how cool this is
it's like Lizzie McGuire okay yeah we
got to go oh it's like a little you can
not be more than two people with your
daddy cat yeah and she doesn't have
enhance the bread just have to say she's
a mess right now okay but I just want to
show you guys there's all this like
shopping and stuff around here and then
just randomly this is what are this
guy's doctors offices it's like so grand
and pretty look at how pretty it is guys
like white and like this is where your
doctor's office is like are you for real
and there was like a regal staircase in
there with like oriental rugs everywhere
like Paris is sick and like these doors
are so unnecessary like look at them
they're huge
what this is demo I just do more I guess
for me
so you're just on the tram as it's
called there ain't much oh wait it's
different tremors the 101
oh there's a difference between metro
and tram they look the same but we got
off early because I everyone had to get
off I don't know why but we got off like
two stops early from where we wanted to
you but there's a silver lining because
we just had this little crepe stand and
I've been wanting a French crepe so yay
I don't want to
little baby Alex when he took the
bananas
warm so yummy looking guys look at oh my
gosh coming but hey when I was in a boot
last fall and now I have a cast where
are you you were you're always in your
girlfriend
what's that Lu
do people rub on this end is there a
crew here there's no there's a bunch of
cruise boats oh oh
we are how do people like work out down
there yeah you can run by the Sun that's
what I always want to do but I can't go
this is so pretty
they run with the cats on do you think
yeah people always said you all the time
little is your arm
because I can't get over how pretty this
is
wait Lucy what is that big building that
isn't no true DOM
it's so pretty Parliament is that in
London I get so confused between Paris
and London tell the same team what's the
blue white and red flag France Alou oh
that would make sense
senator I know what a Madeleine was like
so they just copy France
I'm stopped you were exploring at night
by the way we didn't even tell them
Happy Thanksgiving doesn't really feel
like it or not like doesn't really feel
like Thanksgiving because it's so cute
Lou because we're not like with our
family like eating okay well guys look
at this is about to be me in like point
two seconds whoa what's that
that is so cool look how many people are
taking pictures huh that's so funny
okay I miss it it was just ringing
because it's it is 6:30 we have to hurry
because we're trying to go to Tiffany's
where before closes it's so neat Oh
Hotel Divi so jet-lagged I have no sense
of time okay oh oh yeah I was logged
this time the Metro so they can see it
it's like I'm sure some of you are maybe
French or have been here before but I
know not an opportunity guys don't watch
my videos anyway heard from America so I
feel like it's just cool to show
everything
so it's kind of like a subway in New
York but cleaner and nicer oh yeah
easier to navigate if to get more what's
recharge might mean
kyoool
this is the Metro because it's
Underground in tram is above ground but
they're the same things what if it goes
underground and above ground then what
is it
the stops and suffer
oh the other one coming
was just felt so crowded well oh look at
the trees I didn't vlog last night
tonight yeah I didn't have my blog
camera but we were right here near here
last night cuz clean is right here here
but look at the Tiffany's we're here
guys it's like all lit up the tiffany
blue it's so pretty
well I'm so excited I have this idea
that listen me get matching jewelry so I
guess we'll see what we pick out
I hope play something cute like those
come here and get like engaged here oh I
bet future husband I want my ring yeah
cuz it's so dirty it's literally gross
I'm like you need to get that clean it
looks like light gray I know they got to
see it we're in the washroom guys it's
so cute hopefully we don't get yelled at
for filming there's people that work
here over there so I had to be careful
look this Sephora has like Helvete Norka
oh and we just got stuff at Tiffany's
except she was like you have to put it
in this white bag because of security
reasons are just so smart because if you
had a blue bag someone probably would
just run by or they could and just like
grab it you know guys look the ferris
wheel the ferris wheel is all it up oh
this is too damaged but we just did a
Tiffany this is the ring I got guys it
is
q and Lucy was gonna get it too but then
she was like I don't know if I like it
that much she wasn't sure so she's gonna
wait and see they look so cute together
I had to put it back in that way back so
that people don't grab it out of my
hands because Lucy for sure has gotten
so many things stolen in Paris Bucky the
Arctic Tramp is up there it's so pretty
and all the store
and all the Christmas lights are just
making me so festive
we don't know who it is but they're
probably cool
they're probably important
so he's important guys we got
eat up arguably tied with the hummus
kitchen in New York cause that's my
favorite they're both so good I like
this impermissible Manhunter to the Dena
she assaulted me like I love like Cedars
and Sabra but it's too salty to me but
this you can just look at you with a
spoon like by itself like whenever you
go to a restaurant in the Met Back Bay
house it really good wait how much do
you can still eat probably weird with
your left hand
dude it feels so awkward good probably
get so used to it after oh my god you're
welcome now you're gonna be like
ambidextrous you should like girls love
you you should commit few outcomes to
goodbye to the falafel but I picked out
the egg quick because I'm scared about
