more than anyone especially if you've
been watching my videos for a while now
just how much I struggled with my skin
in the past and how much it makes me
just so insecure and I hate it as you
can tell by the title this video is just
going to be how I fixed my acne and I'm
so excited to share this with you guys
so starting way back in the day like the
beginning of my freshman year of high
school really that's when I really first
started getting acne and I was just like
whoa like so overwhelmed like didn't
really know how to handle it and then I
can honestly say I've tried out so many
acne products like every single face
wash acne cream whatever that you can
think of that you can buy at the
drugstore try to all of those went to a
dermatologist for a little while found
some stuff that maybe you worked for
like a little while in high school but
then it just started flaring up again in
college and I'm like okay I need to like
seriously figure out what is going on
and what is gonna work for me so I don't
I talked about this in a blog not too
long ago I was thinking about trying out
cure ology just because I saw asked and
talked about it in one of her blogs and
I was researching it like crazy it
literally came up on my facebook like
timeline you know and it was just all
these people talking about their really
good experience with neurology so I'm
just going to be talking about serology
in this video and basically the product
that saved my life I'm not even kidding
my mom was just saying how my skin looks
better that was like gonna mean so much
to me it's just like a cream that you
put on your face at night it's only once
a day so I really like that it was super
easy because some stuff I've tried in
the past I would have to do like twice a
day or three times a day don't forget to
bring it down your neck or like pills
and stuff and I think oncology you may
be prescribed pills depending on like
what your dermatologist things so
basically through cure ology you have a
dermatologist and like a person that is
monitoring your progress your first
thing that you try isn't working for you
they can try something else
all our skin is different so like your
treatment will be different than my
treating but I'll just tell you it says
Gretchen Garrity and mine's 4% Alec
to say that 1% clindamycin and 4%
niacinamide you do like a questionnaire
I'm pretty sure I took in the beginning
of just like your skin type a medical
industry enough like that and they
formulate what they think will be best
for you and your skin like moving
forward if you can't even tell I'm not
even wearing a makeup right now it's oh
that's so exciting like literally the
past two days right mom I haven't even
been wearing makeup I haven't done that
in so long like I always feel so
uncomfortable not wearing makeup all
these past two days I haven't been
wearing any makeup
oh wait correction there is no makeup on
my skin whatsoever like look at like I
would not be able to like do that if
there was like foundation or anything in
my skin but I did put eyeshadow in my
eyebrows this morning because they are
so sparse as you can see right here in
these before photos that I took before
cure ology these are ones I uploaded
when I was June like the questionnaire
just so that my skin care provider could
like see the before photos and make some
decisions based on those too so as you
can tell I have lots of acne going on
and I was so uncomfortable with it and
it's sort of embarrassing that I have to
put it in this video but I really want
you guys to just see like how much curl
do you really work for me and I guess I
can't even show you in the video this
will probably be even better than my
after pictures that I took also to put
on ecology as you can see I still have
some like acne scarring and I've had
that like forever it may be like a
couple breakouts but so much better than
where I started I've just honestly seen
such an improvement like I said the
results speak for themselves like me
talking about how great it is I mean you
could actually see how great this oh
yeah and even says your provider and
then their name so you know someone's
like checking in with you you'll get
emails from them oh and another thing I
wanted to mention sorry this is like all
over the place but in the beginning I
was sort of freaking out I was like okay
I don't think this is working for me
because I was actually breaking out more
if you can even imagine than that
picture and the very beginning i was
like 'man on her and I was like I think
my skin is breaking out more like maybe
it's like purging like I don't know and
they say that's totally normal for your
skin's like purge at the beginning
because it's helping get like everything
out of your system but then after that
once all of that acne goes away it
should be better and as you can
tell it's been a lot better I'm really
happy that I went through that because
literally anything else would I don't
know if I should do it anymore but wha
but just know that it's totally normal I
got so many calls from people being like
urology saved my skin it was my last
resort and it helped so much so just
hearing less other people's feedback
really helped me to stay positive about
it all and have faith that it would work
and it did and I think it's so special
that it's unique for you
so as I've already mentioned it is a
prescription medication customized just
for your skin and actually your first
month will be like a free trial so
that's really awesome and then after
that it's only 1995 a month so you guys
should check out the description box in
the very top line I'll have a link so
that you guys can try out ecology for
the first month for free all you have to
do is pay for shipping and shipping is
only 495 so that is so awesome and
opportunity - I should totally take
advantage of and I just want to address
it quickly I feel like I always have to
say this at my sponsored videos now but
I'm just gonna straight-up tell you guys
thank you so much ecology for sponsoring
this video because I'm so happy that we
got in contact because I really truly
enjoyed it I feel like just my viewers
that have struggled with their acne in
the past that this can help you guys so
much this is really awesome that I can
be in a video it with no makeup because
that never happens ever hope you guys
try it out I hope it works for you too
thank you guys so much for watching this
video and I'll see you my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
