video where I get to show you how I get
my blonde hair because I'm naturally
like medium I have a pretty medium brown
hair if you can tell by my atrocious
roots I think they look kind of dark cuz
they're games like blonde but my hair
naturally isn't that dark I even had
kind of natural like blonde highlights
when I was brunette but yeah it's just
like this medium brown color in kind of
a backstory I've actually been getting
highlights since I was 9 years old and I
know that sounds crazy hold on basically
I like on my parents into thinking that
the other one thought that they said yes
do you know I'm saying like my dad was
like no my mom said no and I was like
mom but daddy said yes and she was like
really and I was like yeah so then she
let me get highlights my dad was like
Heidi why did you let her get highlights
and she was like dan I didn't you did
and then I got in trouble but since then
I've had blonde hair except for my
freshman year I dyed it brown but I just
feel like I belong like being a blonde
like everyone's like Gretchen like I
couldn't imagine you'd brunette or like
Gretchen like I feel like you just are
supposed to be blind like blonde looks
better on you anyway which is funny
because I'm like naturally brunette but
I just love having blonde hair and I'm
actually going to get highlights in a
couple minutes with my favorite
hairdresser ever I'm obsessed with Jo I
love her so much
she is so nice and it is just great and
I guess it'll just you know I'm just
gonna tell you like where she works
because if you were from my era you need
to get your hair done by her like she's
literally amazing like I love her she
saved my hair in the past she's done
like the best highlights and lowlights
I've ever had she's always done my hair
for prom she's amazing
her name is Jill she works at ambience
salon I believe it is in Albany OR
Latham maybe Latham yeah so check her
out
amazing tell her I sent you I love her
to bits but yeah I'm going in like a
couple minutes okay so what I wanted to
tell you is it basically I just gave
blonde highlights all over my head you
know I'll get a full set or a partial
and a partial just means I think they
focus on like the top and like the front
and like it's just like less highlights
you know but full set is just like
everywhere and also what you can tell
your hairdresser if you want the same
hair with me
numbers kidding but um what I like is I
like having the darkness underneath so I
leave the very back on the bottom just
out of the highlights completely because
I like having that darkness under I
think it just helps balance like all the
blonde you know and I don't like getting
to blonde so also sometimes if I'm
saying like my hair is getting really
blonde or - like bleach blonde or
something I
we're throwing some lowlights and I just
get some brown like lowlights in my hair
and I feel like people don't understand
the concept of lowlights basically if
you don't know lowlights are it's just
like highlights is getting blonde
streaks in your hair and Lilith is just
getting brown streaks in your hair so
sometimes I'll get some of that and you
can tell rich are pretty bad right now
they're probably like an inch out I
don't even know I usually I will
honestly I just don't even care that
much like I will wait two to three
months even between getting my how it's
done
I remember I was younger I was crazy and
I like hated having her out go every
single month and like kill my hair but
now I pretty much go like every three
months and it's harder since I go to
college Emmaus and so I'm not home to go
to jail because I will not want anyone
other than Jill touch my hair I have to
wait till I come home to have an
appointment you know what I'm saying so
I'm going my hair down I might get a
little trim I really don't want to get a
trim but it's kind of gross at the ends
so I'm just gonna get I think a tiny
trim and I'll show you what it looks
like after so we won't have any of that
going on anymore and also when I'm done
I'll show you kind of hair care and what
I do to maintain my blonde
because if you get blonde highlights it
can tend to get a little bit brassy and
not as bright so I have ways of like
coping with that which I will show you
when I get back
so yeah wish me luck I hope it goes well
I know it will and I'll see you I get
back hey guys so I'm back looking no
more roots yay it's seriously so blonde
I love it I'm liking Lola's next time I
go like I was saying earlier because
it's getting like very very blonde and I
don't like to be like bullhead blonde I
like to have some with darkness which I
have underneath but I like to have some
dark music threaded through you know but
look it's a lot you know I'm not switch
where I'm sitting because it's lighting
isn't good anymore since it's like dusk
it's getting dark out so hang on all
right I hope this lighting is better but
as you can see like I was saying my hair
is very very blonde and I'm very happy I
don't efforts oh and also if you can't
tell I didn't end up getting a trim
because I was like Jill what do you
think like tiny the trim and she was
like now I don't think that we can wait
till next time and I was like yes cuz
like I don't like getting my hair cut
like I want to be long again so I didn't
get a trim but I'm happy she said I
didn't think I needed to I mean I think
I sort of do like it's a little string
at the ends probably some of you were
like it's thrown at you tonight so ah
but like I don't care I just don't my
hair be long and I just wanted to get on
into the section where I'm going to show
you basically what I've been doing with
my hair and how I keep up with the
maintenance of cubing blonde hair
because it can be pretty tricky
missing me
on you what I've been using the most
recently and what I've been loving and
how I get my hair to look like this so
I've been using this shampoo and
conditioner from a salon and I love the
shampoo and conditioner if you guys
watch my blogs my blog Channel Gretchen
and Lucy go check it out if you don't
subscribe already we make vlogs like
every day I know I talk about this in
there because I've been loving it I've
been using it for the past month or so
and it smells so good like I can't even
describe the scent to you like poison
smells really good so I definitely like
that and what I like the most is that
these are specifically for color-treated
hair because I don't really use a color
treated specific like shampoos and
conditioners before this and I truly
think it's such a good idea because
these don't have sulfates and they don't
have really harsh chemicals that will
fade your colored hair because that's
definitely like a concern like blonde
hair is pretty hard to maintain those
are also both gentle and like daily
shampoos and conditioners which is
really good because they're specifically
like formulated to be gentle so that it
doesn't like strip your hair color you
know and then also what I've been using
is the perfect ending leaving it
conditioner and guys I cannot even talk
enough about just leaving conditioners
ok so my philosophy behind this is like
I've always used leave-in conditioners
because I just think they help so much
and for me my hair gets pretty dry
normally since I do like bleach it a
bunch so I definitely always use a
leaving conditioner once I go to the
shower especially this one I really like
because I've used ones in the past that
are really heavy and they like weigh
your hair down and you can feel like a
backup like residue in it but this I
don't at all i really like this bit it's
like lightweight enough that it doesn't
weigh down your hair but it's still like
conditions your hair and I like it too
when I get out the shower my hair's wet
because it's usually like all in knots
my hair gets really naughty but when I
use this helps me like comb out my hair
too and also I think I noticed with
using this leaving conditioner that
makes your hair less frizzy and you
don't have like flyaways which is like
seriously most like I usually appear I
get pretty like fluffy like flyaways and
stuff I pretty straight hair naturally
it's like kind of wavy if you saw in the
first clip before I got my hair done
that was my natural hair it's like
almost like this it's fairly straight I
had some waves and this is strained a
little bit it's gotten with a little
wavy right here in the front since it's
been you know Chuck behind my ear for a
while so my hair naturally I would say
is like Fairley's training with a little
wave but pretty much it's straight so I
think this would be got on straight hair
it'll be done really curly hair you get
are just like wavy hair because I think
any hair could use a good like leaving
conditioner you know protip my number
one thing is if you are going blonde and
you have brown hair
you girl you need like a purple shampoo
or purple treatment or purple toner
something like that like purple shampoo
purple tone or purple treatment it will
save your life I'm not kidding I've
tried like various purple shampoos in
the past and those are always good and
this specifically I've been using
recently and this is like literally
lifesaver so I think I touched on it
earlier but basically if you're going
blonde from having brown hair your hair
has to live to a certain level till I
get that blonde that you want so it
starts off like this brown color and
then it gets like a light brown and then
I turn this kind of brassy like orange
which you don't want to I mean maybe if
you do want like orange hair like that's
good on you like go for it but like I
personally don't orange hair and really
warm toned blonde just does not look
good on me I think it's just something
with my skin tone or my eyes I don't
know I just don't like the way it looks
and I've made that mistake so many times
or either like the dye wasn't left in
long enough or it wasn't like the strong
enough kind or like the high enough
level of bleach to turn I'm saying so
literally purple shampoo will change
your life my try to explain to you like
the way my hairdresser did I hope I
don't screw anything up but so if you
think about it say your hair has been
bleached and you're trying to get it
like really want like this or maybe even
a little bit blonder and it's looking
orangie brassy and you don't want it
like that the reason is is because it's
not like toning oXXO toner will save
your life like it will completely
transform the color of your hair
especially if you use it like after you
diet so if you think about it like the
orange color on like the color wheel is
completely opposite like the purpley
blue you actually want to use this
really dark purple e a blue color for
like a treatment or a shampoo and it
will lift your hair to this nice like
bleach blond like white color because
that's what I'm looking for and I know a
lot of people especially people that
want to go with the silvery more like
gray route like really cool toned blond
basically the way they do it is just a
heck of a lot of toner so I've been
using this tinted love once in a while
for the past like month you definitely
don't want to use like a treatment like
this every single day maybe once a week
up or whenever you're noticing your hair
is getting kinda brassy and literally
for my vlogs out there that don't know
what I'm talking about like literally if
I can recommend one thing it would be to
get like a purple shampoo or a purple
treatment like this because it will like
transform your hair when you're noticing
your hair is giving cammi's dull and
like orange and I know some people just
get highlights all the time because I
want that like nice bright blond but
literally you don't need to all you need
to do is use like a nice purple
treatment like this purple shampoo I
feel like I've been talking so much
about this but literally like this is
gold like I'm not kidding guys
everybody's hair color chart for all you
like yes basically just like intensifies
like the toning your hair and like
refreshes your hair color and also I
know on their website they have like 20
different shades of this so whatever
hair color you are like it'll help like
intensify your hair and like refresh it
so you don't have to get it looked at as
much but I haven't talked enough about
it I'm trying to like think of it like
basically like it's basically like
neutralizing like the orange in your
hair you even care what I'm talking
about
and also you just leave it on for the
two or three minutes like between when
you shampoo and condition your hair
that's at least how I do it and what
I've noticed and I made this mistake
before but some people do it like on
purpose where if you leave this in too
long it will start turning your hair
like that nice silvery even light purple
color so if you want to go for like a
silver or like light purple hair color
just leave this in for a while and your
hair will like literally turn silver
because I've done that before and I'm
like mmm and I just wait for it's like
fade out cuz I just like this nice
bright like bleach blonde highlights I
don't want like purpley silver hair but
some people do so keep that in mind and
also I haven't had a chance to try these
out yet but I'm really excited to this
is just the shining armor renewing
treatment oil and this is the without a
trace at dry shampoo and I use dry
shampoo all the time especially well
right now I don't have roots but
especially when I do have roots I like
using dry shampoo I notice it helps like
neutralize and like fade like the brown
in the top look into my blonde you know
so I like using like the white like dry
shampoos and like help with blending it
in like that so I know I'm gonna like
this and also the renewing treatment oil
I like to use on my hair but especially
like now I would use it because it's a
kind of jar like I just got it
highlighted so I just take a tiny amount
and just like go like that through my
hair so I'm excited to try these two in
literally these four things I just
talked about are like gold so if you go
to a salon calm and slash Gretchen you
can actually get three products for $15
which I think it's such a good deal or
you can check out the link in my
description box and if you just want 50%
off any of these products if someone
names showing you and again it just
check out the description box link down
below so yeah I think that is pretty
much it when it comes to my blonde hair
definitely just using products that are
tailored to colored hair and my car
lighter hair specifically like shampoo
and conditioner for color-treated hair
and using a toner like oh my gosh I
don't talk about so much but using to
tone our purple shampoo or a purple
treatment like this like you need it so

video and I'll see you my next one bye
