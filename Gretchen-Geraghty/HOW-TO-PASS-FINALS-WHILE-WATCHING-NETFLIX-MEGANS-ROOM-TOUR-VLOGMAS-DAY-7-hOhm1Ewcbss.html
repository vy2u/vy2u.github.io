day I was gonna say 8:00 it's 7:00 and
Megan's give you take over today yeah
cuz I yeah like Taylor took over the
other day Megan's taking over today cuz
I have my marketing and operations exam
that I just like really need to study
for it's like 8 a.m. right now and I'll
probably be done in like 13 hours
totally done please she was really
exciting beyond what I can be studying
all day so I just can't really deal with
it so Becca is gonna yeah hi everyone
says Gretchen said I'll be taking over
the vlog today not much of the schedule
I have two classes both in questrom and
I usually get coffee with my friend Matt
in the morning and then we want to brush
them together so we're definitely gonna
do that and then hopefully you can get a
room tour in later today and maybe make
some dinner see what's up I don't know
I'll think of something
so as I said every Tuesday Thursday my
friend Mack at coffee shop so we're just
gonna go get coffee and even though it's
breathing out we always get iced coffee
cuts were not crazy
so don't know how to zoom on this thing
but we made it
what are you gonna get you might smell a
black
I always say I'm gonna change my mind
and then I always get black iced coffee
one pump pumpkin soil so listen what
happens today you guys don't know
sprinkle munchkins look so good I want
them so bad a lot of you may be
wondering like why my voice sounds like
this day but I've been like having a
cold of all week and Gretchen I were
supposed to go to Urgent Care yesterday
and then we did it because I got too
busy and I keep putting it off and I
probably will put it off until I get
home but that's why I sound super raspy
smile
then I would walk 500 more just to be
the man down
but maybe that guy's time for my classes
you're actually the worst I can hear the
volume it's black you're the worst
I did my marketing practice exam did
quite well and I realized I have four
hours to my exam start so I can do my
operations in later and watch no ok good
luck with that
bye Gretchen so I just got back from all
of my classes and I made lunch I had
Brussels sprouts and some fish and some
grapes on the side and I just thought
it'd be a good time to kind of give you
guys a room tour so my room is
definitely set up a little different
than Taylor and Gretchen's mines on the
other side of where the common room is I
like it though I like the setup
I like changed around my room like a
million times when I got back because I
couldn't really figure out like where I
wanted my bed and where I wanted my desk
so I think this is the final combination
that works best for me so on my desk I
pretty much just like have all of my
books my laptop and I kind of keep it
clear because I sort of like a lot of
space to like work like usually when I'm
doing homework I have a textbook out and
a notebook out and maybe my laptop too
so there's not much space for anything
else I used to have this orchid but over
Thanksgiving break it died alrighty my
orchid very sad I sort of have like a
collage a few pictures of like my sister
and me and my mother me and my dad and
then some friends from high school and
you know just like some really cute
pictures that I loved because like I
don't know when you're studying you kind
of want to like something that makes me
happy so I love having those pictures
there and then on top I just have like
nice smelling candle and then a little
sign this is the best is yet to come I
like really like those little signs
because I don't know they just like make
me super happy you know my vitamins and
medicine I think like probiotics
everyday fish oil and some like iron
pills because I don't know if you guys
but earlier in August I had a surgery so
I take some like joint health medicine
also because I had hip surgery he's just
trying to say you know healthy happy and
then I have a few books over here just
have like the winter stream which is by
Bill McDermott who was the CEO of like
the company I work for and just like I'm
reading this book we all look up now and
then like a book of poems cuz I don't
know it's nice to have something fun to
read and then on the back of my wall I
have all those like fairy lights I
really like about night when like I
don't want my lights fully on because
they just like kind of give like a nice
glow to the room I think and it's really
nice if like I'm trying to read a book
before I go to bed to have like dim
lighting like above my bed I have like
that little light up dream sign which I
really love it like also gives off like
really nice lighting and it's really
just like a soft lighting I like like
I'm laying in bed I don't want like the
fluorescent lights on and then on my
other wall I actually have my initials
spelled out in floral letters so my name
is Megan Rose good itis so I just have
Mr GE I actually made them myself and
it's just like cardboard letters I
painted gold and I bought like a ton of
fake flowers from Michael's and I sort
of just like cut them off the stands
that hot glue them onto the letters and
I think it's like really nice because
like I don't know flowers just like kind
of make you happy so I think it makes
the room like really warm and light and
I'm like under my initials I just have
like three pictures that I really love
like it's full of like all of my friends
and then like me my cousin and like
another photo of my high school friends
and this summer like took all the photos
and then actually matted them and put
them in the frames myself so I could see
pretty easy to do if you like go to a
craft store and buy madding stuff and
buy like really cheap frames it's like a
really easy way to make your room look
really nice so then on this wall I sort
of have a gallery wall that I kind of
created myself I was actually inspired
by Gretchen last year just sort of
create this wall I don't know if you
guys can see very well but I like have
like some pictures I drew myself and
then I also have like some cool quotes
like this quote from my Beyonce and then
like I don't know pictures I've taken
myself and also like pictures of my
family
and me and my dog and you know just like
things that like really make me happy
because I think it's really nice and
like to have a specific space that like
makes you happy
some of the other things I have are like
these cool quotes like good things come
to those who hustles and like I would
stop drinking coffee but Mohamed didn't
raise a quitter
my little sister actually do that she's
like super good at like art and
calligraphy and all those things and I
just think it's funny to like have nice
little like quotes around I have a
drawing of like Philadelphia cuz that's
where I'm from and then just like some
more pictures of friends and like family
and like the zip code of a blonde New
Jersey that's like where I spend my
summers and like finally this really
cute mirror that says happy looks good
on you so yeah this is like my bedding
and I actually got the comforter and
some of the pillowcases from TJ Maxx and
I actually got the sheets also from TJ
Maxx I like love TJ Maxx because you can
kind of find like a bunch of different
items that you want in like the one
store and like I don't know I wasn't
even thinking of getting a bedding like
with this tribal print on it I kind of
just wanted a plain white one but when I
saw it I thought it was like really cute
and kind of went with my whole room and
then I also got this pillow I think I
got it from red bubble if you guys don't
know they sell like a lot of laptop
stickers and like shower curtains
they're kind of like society6 in a way
and I just love it because like I love
otters they're like my favorite animal
and they're so cute and I think it goes
with the bedding so well and at the
bottom I bet I always have at least like
one or two fluffy blankets I know like
the winters at bossing get like super
cold and like having a nice comfy
blanket at the bottom of your bed is
like a must here the next thing I have
in my room is like this laundry basket
and it's sort of like a brassy gold
finish wiring basket with this cute like
laundry bag inside but I will say and
it's like a super heavy laundry basket
so dragging it all the way to the
laundry room can like sometimes be such
a hassle so the next area in my room is
sort of like it's helped made vanity
it's just above my dresser I like to
keep all my moisturizers serums and like
makeup in this area because I kind of
like to do it in my room instead of in
the bathroom I mean when you're living
with like three other girls there's like
a whole lot of makeup and hair products
kind of flying around so this kind of
gives me my own space kind of like
get ready in the morning or get ready
for bed recently I realized how
important it is to moisturize your skin
especially in the winter it's gonna get
so dry so I definitely like having that
nearby and then secondly I have like
this desk organizer and it's usually
used for like envelopes and notes on a
desk but it actually fits eyeshadows and
like foundations perfectly so it was a
really nice way to kind of like organize
all my eyeshadow palettes and like my
foundations I use these like cute little
mason jars I think I kind of meant like
Target cuz like you get all the best
stuff at Target so in the mason jars I
kind of just have like all my makeup
brushes and then mascara and eye liners
so anything I couldn't really fit in the
mason jars or the envelope desk I got
this like container it has all these
little cute drawers so I could just like
fit little things that just wouldn't
really fit in there and then the last
thing is like above my vanity I have
those inhale-exhale science which you
saw in Gretchen's room also I like love
them so much and it's such a good daily
reminder to like take a deep breath that
like I had to put them in my room as
well because you know sometimes you just
have to like slow down and take a deep
breath so like I was saying earlier my
closet I sort of just he's like black
velvet hangers and then I have these
like brass baskets that kind of match my
laundry basket as well for like sweaters
and sweatshirts and I keep my hats up
there and I would show you the bottom of
my closet but my shoes are everywhere
the head is really it I kind of that's
like the other part of my room you can
see my crutches are still there and I
got rid of them yet hopefully soon and
then yeah I just hang up coats on the
back of my door and that is really all I
have to show you in my room Gretchen is
taking it a break from studying each
other in a different handwriting did you
know yeah
whoa I think I see stars so many boxes
departments wrapped up I think it's star
earrings you yeah these are so fun oh
it's like I'm trying to see if they
weigh like this they go like that
they're like that I don't fit in the
shape of the star I are on the move
she's gonna take her exams is she
prepared now you will find out so I am
walking home now with Wu and we are
gonna meet up with Taylor and then go to
Trader Joe's cuz we have a little bit
choppy interview and today I realize how
hard it is to vlog and it is really hard
to talk in front of a camera all day
long so yeah that's a little rant
because I just dip like three videos and
they're all Noom dude on my face
horrible angles and then they all ended
with me going now and then deleting them
so Gretchen I am giving you a little
shout-out you work really hard and you
make this vlogging thing look easy by
Francis I had to take a video right now
so I feel like this city looks so pretty
and the river looks so pretty you're not
just gonna

Amazon okay what I just thought it was
on as I got 12 canvases and an acrylic
paint set on a whim

photogenic city so you want to show the
people a little parkour so Dylan I just
got a little tag but chicken parm and
yeah we're just gonna jam a little yeah

are big plans for the night for vegan
