off like that I never do that what's up
guys what hey everyone today I have my
Black Friday over you I'm seriously so
excited to show you everything that I
got and yeah let's just get right into
it so the first place I have to show you
stuff from is actually PacSun I'm about
to tell you the coolest thing ever okay
so there's a sub site called card pool
and it's where I got a gift card to get
stuff from packs on it but it's
basically awesome because you like get a
discount on clothes that you want for
free so and you don't know carpool is
just basically this website where you
can buy gift cards for cheaper like you
buy like they have more money on them
than what you buy them for it you can
also sell gift cards if you don't use
them especially during the holidays
you're gonna be getting gift cards from
like your friends and your family and if
you're not gonna use them and you don't
like them you can just sell them on
carpool which is so awesome because then
you can just get like actual money back
from it and also for me it's so awesome
because they have like blue lemon on
there and they have like abercrombie and
fitch they have packs on so you can
literally just buy gift cards if you
know you're going to buy clothes from
there and then it's like getting the
clothes for cheaper so it seriously it's
so awesome and yeah if you haven't heard
about it like I just gave you the best
gift of all so basically I only spent
like I don't even remember was probably
round like 30 something dollars for like
a $50 gift card to packs on so that I
could get all these clothes and it was
way cheaper so like just some
money-saving ideas guys first thing I
just got from PacSun is like this medium
blue short sleeve shirt and it's really
soft and stretchy it's kind of like
those soft stretchy t-shirts from
Brittany Melville you know it feels like
that and I know I'm gonna wear it a
bunch like I just can't see myself
wearing this a lot and the next thing I
got from PacSun is just this long sleeve
like beige tan shirt and it has all
these ribbed details and this is
seriously so cute like I have some long
like tight cropped shirts like this like
a white one and a black one and I wear
those a bunch so I know where they salon
and then I just got this skirt it's like
suede and like kind of like a dark green
color and I like do not have enough
skirts so I definitely will wear this
with the holiday time thumbs up this
video if you like tryout hauls because I
know I do and you guys seem to
appreciate them they take like a lot
longer to film and edit and everything
but I
it's worth it could you guys like them
and yeah yeah I'm gonna try these online
Mandy it was here watching you filming
right now wait okay I'll just explain
this really quick so basically our mall
was open yesterday which was
Thanksgiving from 8 p.m. to 1 a.m. and
then the mall opened back up at 7 a.m.
today it's like Black Friday this year
so weird today is Black Friday it
doesn't feel like it but it is it's the
Friday after Thanksgiving which was
yesterday ok and Mandy and Lucy and I
are gonna go back to the mall later and
like do some more shopping so that's
also part of my Black Friday haul but
I'm going to film that later because I
just want to show this stuff now Jo yeah
this is all the stuff that I got like
the first part of my Friday which was
actually Thanksgiving and I'll show you
the other stuff I got later so then the
next thing I got on Black Friday I'm
actually filming this right now it's my
new vlogging camera and the reason I'm
filming with my blog camera and not my
normal like DSLR camera is because that
cameras back up you in my dorm I forgot
it there so this is nice that I bought
this here because then I can film with
it it's just the canon powershot g7x if
you guys are wondering and yeah it's
really good quality of you notice a
difference let me know I've seen like
other people's videos that they film
with it so yeah I'm also walking today
by the way so you guys will see that in
the upcoming future so that's the next
thing I got I just got it from like Best
Buy
through that I went to Lord and Taylor
and I actually got this shirt and this
is from Free People but you know they
have like a section like a mourning
Taylor it's just like this forest green
color I guess maybe a little bit lighter
and it just has these cuffs and I have
this in tan and like the cuffs are like
red and I actually got it as Mandy had
it shut out Randy I copied her but I
just think these shirts are so cute and
so unique was like the little cups like
that they're like really adorable so I'm
really happy I got this shirt you know
and then I went to Abercrombie and I
just got this puffer vest it's just
black and it has like fur on the inside
too so it's super nice I know I'll wear
it a bunch
especially when it gets colder out then
I got some undies and I'm just gonna
show you guys she does that weird -
weird no okay here I'll just I'll just
like give you a quick overview I got a
bunch of underwear from airing because
there's a big sale
okay that's my mare can you go I got
this furry vest and quick story real
quick I digress
I'd like a teacher don't your teachers
always say that like I digress Scott I
was in Faneuil Hall the other day like
in Boston and we were just walking
around and I saw like in this like hair
salon place a woman was wearing a white
fluffy vest like this we were just
walking by and I was like oh my god I
love it and I need it so I really just
walked in there I was like excuse me
ma'am I was like where did you get your
best interests like I got it from the
park it was only like 30 bucks follow-up
but I never sought to target so I was
like okay whatever we went to American
Eagle and I saw this big furry like
creamish white fluffy vest and I was
like oh my god I need it it's really
something fluffy I just hope it doesn't
shed too much that's like one concern I
have about it because it looks like it's
shutting a bit I just love it it's so
fluffy and then keeping with like the
soft and fluffy trend from American
Eagle
I got a scarf maybe I get fuzzies on
yeah Oh PS I'm about to leave for my
hair appointment like right now like I
know my hair is so gross but it'll be
better
oh my gosh in it in the next part of
this haul video guys it's gonna be
better because I'm gonna film it later
after I get my hair done yes Neagle is
justice fluffy black and white like
plaid like checkered scarf
guys seriously like go feel these
scarves I know they have a bunch of
different colors man
go to your merican Eagle and feel this
scarf because it's seriously like so
soft it's like open etiquette and I just
really like it and I'm gonna wear a
bunch and then I got some presents in
here but I can't tell you because one of
the recipients is sitting right there
and she knows but it's okay so there's
just two different presents in here that
is all I will say Oakley had a good sale
on Black Friday and then an American
Eagle if you spent I think it was $75 or
more you got this big blanket and the
girl was like Gretchen well she didn't
know my name so she didn't say that but
she was like girl friend you're only
like five dollars a night like you need
to spend more money so you get this big
blanket which I haven't even really
looked at yet but I guess it's just red
white and blue it just has this big
white eagle on there so that's
maybe I'll bring this back to college
with me I don't know I don't know we'll
see it to get that I had you spend more
money
I was with Hannah and she was like just
get Justin boxers and I was like okay so
Justin when you watch this you usually
watch my videos surprise yeah they're
just Nutcracker boxers so you're welcome
oh my gosh I seriously love this camera
it's like auto focus is on video this is
so great oh when you guys are commenting
on my like Sephora haul video and my
hair looks long and I was like oh my
gosh I literally have to learn my hair
flip right now so the last two things I
got yesterday but there will be more
right after this that you'll see that
when I go to like Lululemon and such I
really want to be a bradley makeup
organizer too so I'll probably get that
but the last thing I got yesterday Black
Friday shopping but it was really I
think I got these two things of socks I
just went to Dick's and they didn't like
my favorite socks or just like the Under
Armour I think our boy one they're just
like black and gray ones and I have a
kabillion it is but you know you always
seem to lose your socks they like just
go away I don't know where they go so I
got to introduce and then I think it was
like buy one get one 50% off and I was
like dang good deals so I got some more
Under Armour socks he's actually women's
oh so that's nice and they just have all
these different colors and I really just
wanted them for this pair like isn't
that just cute I don't know they're like
purple and like heathered like yeah so I
just got bunch of socks because you need
lots of socks people especially in
college I just feel like they disappear
when you do your laundry yep so that is
all for the beginning of this Black
Friday haul but like there will probably
be like 10 minutes after this where I go
blah blah blah and I show you everything
else I got so stay tuned not just you
guys know what I've been dealing with
this the whole time hi little nugs so
guys it's later if you can't tell and
yes I got my hair done you probably
can't even tell like I feel like it's
not that different but I did get low
lights like I said if you can see the
darker pieces and I really really like
it I wanted a but I never meet up after
this so I got something get down below
once I put it up in case you're watching
this later on if you feel me but yeah no
more roots so that's exciting
I caught it all Jill shells my
hairdresser and she's like you want to
get a cut and I was like no I wanted to
be long steel so she totally understands
me and probably half of you like don't
even care so I'm sorry I'll just finish
showing you the stuff that I got for
Black Friday because we went back to the
mall like I said but I actually didn't
get that much whoo I do a couple stores
but I just like wasn't feeling it so I
really just got stuff from Lululemon
like that's I just got everything from
the lemon so this shouldn't be too much
longer and I'll just show you what I got
so in the first shirt I got it just this
purple short sleeve shirt and I'm so
happy I got this I was like eyeing it
online I like spotted it the other day
it's like a new arrival when I saw it I
was like that needs to be in my life and
I love these kind of shirts to workout
in because I have this in like one or
two other colors I like love it and I
always have wanted to get more and guys
I feel really bad I actually meant to
like have prices for this Black Friday
haul because a lot of you have been
tweeting me and just like commenting on
other videos and saying that you want me
to include prices in my whole videos but
I just totally forgot was beginning this
video so I guess I'll just do it for
these last three items if that like
makes up at all sorry this one is just
$58 and yeah I'm really happy I got it
and then this thing Lucy found and it
was on sale like you see this purple tag
this is like tears of joy so it was only
$34 and normally it was 58 so this is so
awesome it's called the end to the
street tank it's just like ribbed and
like stretchy and it goes like that in
the back panel it's like the power why I
wanted you guys know those ones cuz I
have some of those like super good to
work out in so I love that and then this
first thing I just showed you is called
the swiftly tech SS crew and then the
last thing I got from Lululemon are
these pants and I'm so happy I got these
guys they are just the speed tight IV
ode that means for those are Roman
numerals
oopsie yeah okay so there's like speed
tight for and they're just just like
it's like houndstooth print I believe
can you guys tell me I think that sounds
tooth right it's just like the it's kind
of like a dark grey and white like Zig
zaggy pattern I would say I love it
because it has pockets right there and I
have these in black and like they're
seriously the best kids ever guys
because of the pockets like how many
times you wearing leggings and your
tanga niya she's had pockets well these
ones do so they're really awesome and
they look a little zipper in the back if
you were like working out or running and
you want to put your ID or your key in
there which I never really appreciated
until now since I'm in college like when
I've been running it's so nice to have
these pants that have the little zipper
at the back to put my ID in I really
love these they're like kind of
expensive like these ones oh now I feel
bad I'm seeing the prices they were $108
which I know is like ridiculous for
pants but I'm gonna wear them so much
when I workout and I'll just wear them
like with no clothes so it's totally
worth it for me and this is ridiculous
it just took me four minutes to talk
about like three things but I just like
them a lot and you guys know I love Lulu
and in one of my last haul videos you
guys were like I can't believe you
didn't show any little lemon in this so
here's a little lemon to like fulfill
your little lemon needs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
