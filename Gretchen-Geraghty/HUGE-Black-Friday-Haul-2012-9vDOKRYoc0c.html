Black Friday haul and this is really
exciting because we were so excited to
go to Black Friday right
like come on we were oh my gosh we're so
excited we went Lucy and me Lucy and I
we went with two of our friends and we
went at like 4:30 4 5 o'clock in the
morning and woke up at like 4:00 and it
was just so exciting and we love for
Black Friday shopping and we saved up
our money for a while so this is gonna
be a really big exciting haul for us and
we're really excited to show you what we
got and yeah it's just getting to it how
would you start cuz you know sir
go ahead so right when we got to the
mall with my hollister because they had
a sale 50% off until 6 o'clock so we ran
there and I got the room is short on me
because I don't know cuz you have long
legs yeah all the color in the pants but
I don't care I got this shirt it's like
really soft it's kind of a royal blue
but it's faded I don't know it's baggy
it's okay yeah it's lighter than the
Hollister I got this shirt I just felt
like sitting by itself all the lonely
and crinkled up so I grabbed it and I
turned it on and yeah it's just like
it's really flowy baggy it's like a kind
of a cupboard out blue-gray material you
know what I mean like burn out that
whole thing going on and it's really
comfy it's probably like my favorite
thing that I got you know it was so
cheap and it was on super sale just so
you know and
I got this sweater I didn't even try it
on yet gotta get right on my friend
Kathleen actually bought it Kathleen if
you're watching this love you mom
this this - which hair I think I have a
lot of their sweaters - so this matter
it's like stretchy is it high-low kind
of a little maybe slouchy
and yeah it's really bad oh my like a
trend for today's shopping trip was like
loose and baggy and Laurel from neutral
yeah so this is just gonna be really
comfy and nice for layering and whatnot
with like scars yeah infinity scarves
I've gotten so many other do something
so that is all we got it Hollister that
then we went oh this be new in the order
that we went shopping so yeah we ran to
a hosta and every time in case you
didn't know oh yeah you don't know um
because their store was 50% off till 6
a.m. and then after 6 a.m. till 11 a.m.
it was 40% off so yeah we like rain they
raise we gets them up and the only thing
I don't ever convey I really really love
because it's pretty unique and I look
nothing like it it's a tank top but it
it's a kind of a higher neck and it
looks really cute on and it's like lace
so it's really pretty and it's just
flowy and it had to get it in a large
because it was the only one left which
is annoying but it's okay cuz I can just
wear it with leggings in my weight class
or boots yeah and the lace has like
little sequins and sparkles and I I
guess maybe you can see I don't really
know oh my gosh the battery's dying oh
I'm gonna cry I'm gonna have to charge
it and so I'm just really happy that I
got this cute little tank top and I love
everywhere meat smells so good so that's
all I got Abercrombie and that was on
super sale teen
Lucy I got a pair of pants I've been
eyeing for a long time and they're like
floral jeans they're like those are
floor it's a floral that's like damask
print well I don't know what you there
in damask the Lighting's yeah that's it
I've been eyeing them for everything
they're like skinny jeans or denim but
they have like a really and if you if
you look at the quickly you wouldn't see
it but it's um kind of like they have a
design obviously but it's more subtle so
that I really like about I'm like
wearable laughing because they're still
jeans but I've been eyeing them for a
while and they were they were 50% off
with that they're still not okay next to
garage I've got I got this sweater and
it's actually cardigan and it's just
dark grey and I really like it I have I
actually don't the shop at garage Allah
but so next up let's really keep
something veal chop there more often and
yeah as I said it's just like a dark
grey sorry I'm like bad about you but um
it's kind of like thin and look pretty
open it as you can see and I just got it
a really big and baggy was like things
worth like it comes in my combat boots
or riding boot sir yeah so that I don't
infinity scarf it has like no it's
different textures it's kind of strange
almost yeah where is a nice car yeah
next you had two packs on and I I've
been eyeing these let's just super cross
business very quickly yeah we're very
tired you see that way too late um but
so okay I've been running black heart
and took a long time on that habit of
the week videos around learning about
combat boots they're hers that she has
and um I was really like I was like this
close to Barney to Steve Madden triple
ones because I just wanted like a plain
black pair of car boots
and it's really hard to like find I just
plain black pair and I don't with
honestly I don't really care like it's
good to have any quality stuff but I
don't care if I could find it for
cheaper why not I mean as long as they
don't look to that cloudy and I think
this was a really nice I've been like
eyeing them for a while and I saw that
my packs in a few weeks ago and I know I
run into them and they're just plain
black combat these as you could guess
and yeah I'm really happy I got these
yeah I just really like them so now I
might have to tweak some I'm wearing
black I would still be mine not my
sisters so but they're like the same so
I I was bad I thought she's driven
asunder yeah she's like you're swearing
which is like I thought you'd be happy
because then I wouldn't have to steal
your soul well I where you're gonna go
by and munch me hair so I'm so happy
because I really love combat boots and
really black ivory looks like what can't
you wear these with so I wear them all
the time and yeah that's all Oh Lucy you
get anything in excess so then I'm gonna
- hmm all right
just got it's just this big baggy
sweater cuz oliveira militares like big
baggy sweaters I know
typical typical everyone because ever
nice big baggy sweaters but and I didn't
even try it on yet God I didn't turn it
anything and it was only well we're not
saying phrases because they're just
gonna be up here or up here as you've
noticed but there's like a huge $10
sticker on it so you'll see it and it's
like tag $10 tag thank you and it's just
maybe blue with kind of like darkness of
like red and white was like blue in the
middle uh my god I'm so you would see
it's like a print kind of but yeah I
like it it's oh my god it's kind of
itchy don't feel that no itchy itchy but
whatever and then what did you get a
chance I got other stuff so inside there
it's just like so cute and like has a
pocket folds over its like forest green
I don't know he's kind of like Hanna
knows her hi there oatmeal color in the
middle look it's like an off-white yeah
and then it's like it's boring oh my
gosh it's so soft it feels like you know
if you got it from brandy melville
that's what it feels like that's what
the material I got really bad use of
that yeah then I got this where it is
buttoned um I got this blazer it's like
tan and then black at the bottom it has
one button and I don't know I wanted
employees or in it I'd probably cup over
this and I was happy because I wanted a
blazer this was totally unplanned to buy
this but when I went to at Sephora I got
this pink sugar perfume and if you guys
have ever smelled this you know you know
who does the headache yeah it kind of
gives you anything but this stuff is so
sugary sweet it's seriously like pure
sugar and uh it's I love it though it
smells like you just made like brownies
and cupcakes and cookies and like sugary
and I love it mmm it smells so sugary
and it doesn't yeah yeah gives me a
headache
let's spray it yay okay I love this and
I feel like I feel like it'll be good
quality so it'll expand today next we'll
see went to American Eagle so yeah and I
got this pair I guess they're black like
they they have like stripes that go down
them like that they're like it's like
tired X I don't know there's soku and
they carry on to the back too so I don't
really know they were just sort of
hanging out by themselves and back like
I don't know sale section they're kind
of a purpley blackish gray that's why my
god I'm so jealous she finds the best
pants like those Abercrombie ones you
got and those American Eagle ones look
like these were just in the back and
they're like to exile like there was no
other ones I don't think extra-long hats
without like vacay it's usually just
long but you see me oh well yeah Lucy me
you're so tall she is five five eight
and I'm like five eight five nine like
I'm like a tiny toy better she's like an
inch no quarters I don't know so we are
both not extremely tall but like fairly
tall so in our legs are really long so
we always have issues finding pants that
are long enough and so even even an
Abercrombie like if you get well I have
a comment really upset because I don't
make as your lungs but it's just a
million so I'm thinking too Long's and
then they're bragging on you look stupid
but yeah I she's fighting Hansen over
long enough so even when we get like a
to long it's not long enough and she
found these I'm going to show you the
tag actually cuz that's pretty dang
insane that's like it's a weird this is
I don't know this is 2x Wong so like
extra long like you were made from her
see it says like X Wong these were made
for you live they're perfect when I was
asking
there wasn't even a tag on it like a
price tag yeah it was ripped off she's
sketched I'm gonna definitely put them
there okay
the last place I will be showing you is
that from bodywork oh just randomly
throwing this in here you can sure
whatever my forever21 isn't in here and
because I've ordered off of their
website like a lot recently and so I
like I went in there really briefly and
I was like and nothing special so I
didn't even get anything in there um but
yeah and I just I haven't been showing
what I've been getting up every 21 days
all right no I don't know I only do like
big hauls like if you noticed on my haul
videos are like with other people like
the last summers with Marissa and Hannah
and where usually I know cuz I usually
feel like in the mood for filming cause
if I were like went shopping all day
with my friends but when I order stuff
online or if I'm left by myself I don't
really do hauls but can you comment down
below if you want to see more hauls
because I do shopping around
I just don't haul all the stuff I get
cuz I said it'd be annoying if I did
like weekly hauls like no shut up I
don't care what you want what you buy
giving back on track back to body works
they had buy three get three free and I
just decided to go all out and go for it
because um for Christmas I got the dark
kitchen and I just ran out of it and it
seriously if you don't have anything
darkest that smells like dark history
man go buy something because it smells
so good so as you can imagine the first
thing that I got was a smelly thing I
got was the dark kiss lotion um this is
just like the body lotion I got mostly
in these because it was like any of
their body things but I just like the
real ocean for this so I got the dark a
solution and I got another darkness
solution because for reasons unexplained
okay another dark is list and
more of my area I guess yeah the more
the merrier
then I got the darkest intense moisture
body butter and I really like these well
I feel like I've had one of these like
once but I really don't remember
cuz I usually just get the normal like
body lotions but my friend Hannah was
like I love these like to get them
because they were like I think they're
thicker than the normal lotions and yeah
they're a bit more expensive
um but yeah and she's like she's like
you put this on your legs after you get
in the shower and it's just some stuff
so yeah three dark kiss things hello
because that's the best time ever go by
it reminds me of nighttime because she's
always like darkness if my friends in
the morning thing will be like you smell
entire kiss like they just know that's
me okay then the next thing I got was
this carried away body wonder cuz Hannah
this is Hannah's favorite and she like
told me to get it it really smells like
jello yeah you can't but she's like get
it it smells so good it sounds like
jello so does yeah I got that someone's
like jello and it's like like pretty
excited oh no clean jello no it's a
little dirty jealous okay so the last
see that I got yeah I got a coupon vial
and going free what what what yeah right
okay okay whatever
okay I got the twisted peppermint um
body lotion oh my gosh surprising and I
yeah and oh my god this haul is getting
