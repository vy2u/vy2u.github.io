video for you and I so I just have to
show you so let's just get right into it
I'm really excited to show you
everything that I've got so the first
thing I have to show you are actually
from this website called adore me and I
just got a bunch of bathing suits it's
actually gonna online lingerie like
subscription website but they have
paintings with on there too and they
have since sleep layer and I know if you
sign up for their subscription you get
like your first month free so it's like
a really good idea I'll have all these
bathing suits at link down below and for
me I don't really mind if I've like
fancy lingerie so I was just looking at
their bathing suits but they literally
have the cutest bathing suits and I
actually did get a pair of undies too so
the first skating so I got is this way
in teal woman it's like kinda like a
greenish aqua blue color and why it's
like this pattern and it's crochet which
I love I love crochet veins it's like
this and I like this because it's like a
banjo but it also has like the tie
around the top so you can write both
ways and I probably thinking Gretchen
and why do you need a bathing suit but
I'm actually going to a root but with
just an over the winter so I will need
bathing suits there so I know I'm gonna
wear all of these in a row book and the
bottoms that just match they look just
like this crochet kind of just green and
white pattern bottoms and in the next
video I got it's just this hot pink kind
of Coraline and it just is really
strappy bathing suit top it has this
really cool design in the back with all
those strings which I love I think it's
so is so adorable and then I just got
the bottom steel with it that just put
this there like hot pink and have a
bunch of strappy detail on the side and
in the last bathing suit I got from
adore me is just this black bathing suit
top and I love it so so much because
it's so unique
illus crosses on the bottom like that I
think it's so cute but like also simple
because it's just black and just ties
around the top in the back and then I
just got the bottoms that go with it and
they're just playing a black bottoms but
you can never have too many playing luck
because your bottoms because they go
with like all bathing suits and they're
just kind of strapping on the sides and
that leads to little strings so I love
all these being seen so much and I'm
really
quality and I'm like I said I just got
one pair of undies from adore me and
it's just this pink lacy thumb I think
it's so cute I had some really cute at
least some details on the top and I
don't know this is weird but I usually
like wearing thongs too because then you
don't have underwear lines which is
always nice like I said I will have all
of these that link down below go check
them out and if you get me missing
something you definitely tweet them at
me because then we can be twins I think
I say that in every video but literally
you guys have like the same stuff as me
just tweet pictures at me because I love
seeing the same stuff that we have and
I'm like oh like me that and I want to
show you these bracelets that I got
which I think are so cute they're just
all gold bracelets now your subreddits
silver jewelry look right now my my
Tiffany necklace and some silver
lookouts nominees like a bunch of them
and then my silver Michael Kors watch
but I've actually gotten it's like gold
jewelry too recently but I really don't
have like any cold related wear so I
found like these gold bracelets which
are so so cute and from this website
called Helen's jewels and I'll have
these linked down below too so you can
definitely go check them out but they
have a bunch of cute jewelry on there so
I just got like four different and gold
bracelets and here's a picture of me
wearing all of them together because I
think they look so cute and the first
one I got is just this more like gold
one with all these like bars can I just
got this one myself twisty and like
wraps around it has like diamonds kind
of balls on the end of it and then I got
another one in that same style that just
wraps around but it's just plain gold
these are like you know just like those
cuff bracelets and this one's like that
- except for one end has like a
turquoise stone and then the other one
has like diamonds so I really like the
way all of these look together you can
definitely go check them out on Hellas
jewels like I said I'm going to show you
guys stuff that I got from this website
called Anne kit and these accessories
are actually the accessories that you
find at like forever 21 in fact son they
have them like when you check out you
know they have like just cool little
phone cases and chargers and stuff so
the first thing I just got is this phone
power bank which is actually gonna come
in so handy like when I have classes all
day and then go to practice and you just
plug your normal charger into this and
plug your phone into it and it'll charge
your phone so it's so nice because you
don't need to be like near an outlet and
I'm so excited to use this and I just
got a cute little like cactus print on
it so I really like that and then I just
got this phone case for an iPhone 6 this
is what my phone case is right now it's
just like the way it's like one but I
just got this one because I think it's
so cute it just has this nice little
floral print on it and then I just got
some plain black earphones because I was
actually needing two new earphones I
have two ones that actually broke them
so I just got these planes black new
ones and like these two I'll have all of
these linked down below as well and then
you just have these two necklaces to
show you it from that happiness boutique
and I know I've talked about them before
they just have really cute necklaces so
the first one I got is just as plain
crystal II like jewels on and I wear
this one all the time you guys always
ask me like where it's from and from
happiness boutique and it's just like a
plain crystal statement necklace and
that's my favorite statement necklace
ever look it's just so adorable on and
in the next necklace I got is kind of a
more intense one it's like silver and it
just has all these dangly like turquoise
beads on it and I think it's so adorable
though and it'll definitely dress up
like any plane after you wear it with
like I could see myself wearing this
with like a t-shirt dress or whatever
like it will just dress up your outfit
is silly I'll have both of these that
link down below as well and then I used
some clothes to show you from this
website called Jane calm and it
basically just has a bunch different
clothes from like other websites but you
can my five and through Jane and they
also have some other stuff on there too
which is also really cool so the first
thing I got is actually this pillow
cover it is just like a gray and white
chevron pillow cover i'ma say I was like
so cheap to this pillow cover was six or
seven dollars so it's so worth it and it
looks so good on my bed those was my
whole kind of grand white theme so I
love that I'm totally friend getting
that if they still have it because also
to you some other stuff comes and goes
pretty quickly so you just that's like
careful with that and then I got this
white shirt from like Jane calm this is
literally so adorable it's like me and
the shirt guy so many white tops but it
just has like lace sleeves and has
cutout shoulder which I think you're so
cute and it just has these like kind of
Crotty detail
down the front then the next thing I got
is just this white on sleeve shirt and
it says GLB right there it's kind of
like a monogram design and it's in this
purple color and I think it's so so
pretty you can dress it up or like dress
it down and yeah I forgot to like show
it so this is just me wearing it and I
love it so so much and then I just got
this v-neck which is seriously so soft
and comfortable I just love it it's like
really stretchy it feels like those
shirts might brandy melville if you know
what I mean and it's just kind of like
acid-wash like just stress looking like
black t-shirt enjoys slouching and has a
pocket right there like even this
necklace I just showed you could go with
this and look dress it up I really like
that look when you wear like more fancy
stuff with less fancy stuff I don't know
how to explain it I got this gray white
sweater and I really like this because I
think it's so unique like the top is all
grey but then there's some grey and
white stripes in the middle and the
bottoms cream and I really like the fit
of this because it's just really flowy
and the last thing I got from Jane comm
it's just this coral cardigan it has
some pockets in the front and it's just
long and very simple and can go with a
whole lot of outfits just to dress it up
or if you're cold because it's just like
a plain color I really go back that I
got from Jane up calm and I don't have
it linked all down below I guess I'm
just winging everything down below today
because that's what I said about
everything and then as you guys know I'm
in Boston now so Newbury Street is
dangerously close to me like I go there
all the time
and there's way too many good shopping
places on Newberry so of course I had to
pop by brandy melville and I found this
shirt and these shorts that are actually
the same print so I can wear them as
like a little outfit if I wanted to this
shirt I wanted a shirt like this fit for
a while it's just like really stretchy
and I think it's so cute on it goes like
lower on your shoulders like that and
it's just really stretchy so it's like
tight but it's silly comfortable and I
really like the print in this - it's
like black with some little flowers I
hope you guys like try at halls like I
just think they're so much better so you
can see how it all looks on and yeah I
hope it's like helpful and in the shorts
I got to go with our dress he's kind of
high waisted fabric flowy shorts and I
have so many of these types of shorts
from brandy melville just like different
colors because they're so comfortable
I thought I just grabbed these to show
you guys I just got these from the
Barnes &amp;amp; Noble like the bookstore Boston
University since I go to school here I
just thought I would get these PJ's
shorts and they just say Boston
University right there and they're just
seriously so comfortable that was
interesting to show you guys I don't
know and I know the whole reason you're
watching this video is because you want
to check into your Lululemon obsession
just like me and I so much to show you
guys I actually have it for a sports for
us to show you I know it's ridiculous
and three of them I got like a couple
weeks ago but I've been waiting to show
you guys the first time I got is just
this light like pale orange one which I
thought was so cute when I saw and I
don't have an orange sports bra so I
thought I really needed this and I love
it because it's like the free to be wild
type if you guys know that kind and it
just crosses in the back like that and I
had some white and kind of dark grey
like spots I don't even know what Prince
that is but I think it's so cute and
like these are all twos but then this
one that I got yesterday was a floor so
I'm kind of like either for reference
and the next fourth row I got just kind
of reminds me of like sunset colors
almost there's like some purple at the
top and like orange and white and I love
it this style type of sport it's just
like the wide sports bra oh my gosh I
got three in this why type wow I guess I
really really do like it like I said and
then I got a gray one which this one is
seriously so adorable it's like dark
grey on the little band around the
bottom and then it's light gray in the
middle and then it has line at green
straps and then okay guys this is so bad
then like two days ago
I feel like emails from alone when they
get new stuff and I got an email that
they got like a royal blue sports bra
and I was like oh because I like
mourning the royal blue like shirt or
sports bra from there for a while but
they don't have big early any other
group the cluttered stuff but as you
guys know the obsession with royal blue
is unreal lately
like I'm just obsessed with royal blue
so I got an email and I like ranch me
marry yesterday so I could get this
fourth row and they had it I'm so happy
it's just like a why royal blue sports
bra and it's so cute I know I'm gonna
wear it so much when I work out and to
crew practice and these have like mesh
in the middle of them back to for when
you're all sweaty so these are sometimes
I just have two more things from lemon
to show you before the end of this whole
video Wow
I just got this tight pink tank top and
seriously it's so tight I got it too and
usually I'm a four in ten cups so this
seriously is like like it's like so
tight on me but it just has like thin
straps and I love the back how it's like
Criss crosses like that I actually have
one like this in black I just really
like this one because I didn't have like
a pinky tank top remove it and then
yesterday when I got this blue sports
bra actually got these black kind of
spandex shorts from the lemon - they're
called the what the sport shorts they're
just like black shorts and I really
really like these because if you guys
know I have like this speed tights which
are my just long black leggings full
women with their pockets on the side so
there was my favorite leggings ever
because they had pockets in them and
these remind me of them because they
have pockets in the side too but they're
like shorts these are the perfect length
because they're not too long but I'm not
too short and they just look like this
are you perfect for growing in so I just
love these puppies and yeah that was
