exciting video to share with you and I
just have a really big collective hole
of some stuff that I've been getting
over the past few weeks I've been doing
lots of shopping and yeah I'm just
really going to show you everything that
I got for the fall maybe even winter
because it's almost like winter no to
since it's like November already
I really have like a million things like
scattered around me on my bed right now
I have so much to show you I don't even
know where to begin but I guess I'll
just start with this massive box you
know what this means
so the first thing I have to show you
are just these black hunter rain boots
and these are just the tall black matte
one decided I really really needed these
like a couple weeks ago when it started
raining really hard and maybe now it's
even gonna snow I don't even want to say
I'm literally jinxing us but in Boston
it gets really cold and I can also wear
them in the snow too if I want I think I
got them like Neiman Marcus but I know
they have them I like a bunch of
different department stores and they
like the more up and then on my friend
Amelia visited a couple weekends ago we
went shopping with her so one place we
went to is Free People because she loves
Free People so I just got two shirts
about this red crop top and it just has
these lace crochet detail any astrocyte
crops you can wear it with like skirts
or high-waisted jeans or whatever and
then in the back it like dips pretty low
like that so I mean this is really cute
I don't have any shirts like this and
then extra I got a free people is just
as long sleeve shirt and that is buttons
right there and it has some tie-dye
details it's just like light purple and
navy blue and then I use some stuff to
show you from brandy melville and the
first thing I have to show you is
actually this dress that I'm wearing
right now it's like short sleeve like
that you can see what it looks like on
right now it's just black it's short
sleeved and it kind of has these ripped
details and try comfortable and you can
like layer it with so many things even
when it gets colder out I feel like I
always do this but what I like something
I usually get it in more than one color
because I know I'll wear it a lot and so
I got the same dress it's just as green
color and yeah I think it's so cute it's
definitely good for the fall in the
winter too I just not don't wear these
so much in the next thing I got from
brandy melville I'm so happy that I got
like you guys I've had this sweater
before it's called Caroline's what
I believe justice cream like really cozy
comfy cardigans and I sweat like every
day it goes with everything but I lost
it recently I can't even remember when
but the couple months ago I was like
where is my cream Caroline's butter I
couldn't find it anywhere so I've been
live on the hunt and I saw this fair the
other day and I was like well I'm just
gonna buy it again because I miss it and
I loved wearing this thing so I got a
new one yay I got a shirt in this style
and it's just like kind of rouged and
like stretchy like this I just got the
rouged white version of it and I really
liked it like goes off the shoulders
super cute last thing I got from rainy
Melville is just this great t-shirt it
says New York 32 and yeah I just think
it's like basic cute little graphic tee
and then I actually got two more things
from write a novel but they're not for
me and I know by the time I put this up
like Hannah Emilia already have them so
that's how I can show you guys let me
know what the meal is you really like
this sign and this is plants or friends
and it just has all these cute little
plans and thing design is so cute and
really like loved it so I'm actually
going to ship it to her like right now
like right after I film this video I
have to go ship these out to my friends
because I miss them being in college so
Amelia if you're seeing this I hope you
like your sign reminds me of you too
like this is just an Amelia sign and
we'll see got it too guys by the way
it's in her dorm room and they she was
just reminded me of Hannah I just miss
my best friend Hannah so much I saw this
and I thought of her so I'm gonna go
ship it out to her and hopefully she
likes it if she like skills to so many
good or some skills but yeah and I hope
you like the shirt I think it's really
cute too and I have it in white so we're
basically 20 I'm seriously so hyper
right now like I've just been eating so
much Halloween candy and literally this
is my last piece and I'm about to eat it
chocolate makes me happy all right
I've been getting a lot of stuff from
Patagonia like randomly recently I guess
I just really like the stuff that
they've had and the first thing I have
to show you from Patagonia is just this
long-sleeve gray t-shirt just says
Patagonia and little black letters right
there
and then on the back it looks like that
it's just like their little Mountain
logo and this is like so comfy and cute
and I literally like wear to class I
just wear it all the time because it's
super cozy and I think this is men's but
I don't care because I like it and then
I got the same one but in short sleeve
and it's green it's just Patagonia and
it has the same logo on the back and I
literally wear these all the time I
don't know why I just like them I think
they're cool and then I have to
Patagonia like sweater type thingies to
show you and the first one is just as
black pullover one and I actually got
this a while ago I just never showed you
guys so I thought I would show you and I
think these are called the better
sweater is Moroni it's like zips all the
way up but then this black one is just
like the normal like corners it buckets
you'd call it and yeah it's just like a
pullover and warm and I like it good
thing I like it because I bought it I
like never saw this one before but
apparently it's like a newer color the
guy was like yeah it's called oxblood
and I was like I love it's just like
this maroon oxblood color I guess and
zips like all the way up I love this
color I think it's me my new favorite
color is ours now how I've been obsessed
like we're all blue lately I think
maroon is gonna be my new favorite color
and then I knew I was forgetting to show
you guys something and I actually got
another Patagonia it just says pullover
white fluffy one and I love it it's just
seriously so soft and so uncomfortable
so yeah it's just his white puffy one
and I like it a lot and the last thing
from Patagonia I have to show you is
just as black picot it's actually the
same material as these better sweaters
but it's like a black pea coat and it
has like buttons all the way down in a
cute little collar at the top it's like
more like a casual pea coat since it's
like that sweater type material and then
the other day I was visiting at Justin
at his school
for our two year anniversary can you
guys believe it I can't believe we've
been together for two years it's so
crazy and we actually just went shopping
all day and I'll show you the presents
he got me so the first thing you got me
is this little infinity
it's just silver and I seriously think
it's so cute look I just love it I
didn't have any little silver infinity
necklace like this and you guys know I
love just like little silver like dating
two necklaces I wear them like all the
time like I one that says gee I'm mad at
Tiffany R and I have my little elephant
that you guys know I wear all the time
too so I really like this and I've been
wearing it ever since I haven't taken it
off
and the next thing he got me is
seriously so exciting oh my gosh I just
got so excited it's the Navy like ivory
Ellis shirt you guys know I love
elephant I love ivory a lot so this is
seriously the best present ever I'm so
excited
it just has the little white elephant
right there with a pocket and then that
looks like that it's just that white
little print since I really love this
thanks Justin and then like I said we
just went shopping around the mall there
and don't worry guys he's like not too
far away from me like all of you guys
are worried and are like have you broken
up like do you go to same school no you
don't go to the same College but we
haven't broken up and we still get to
see each other a lot so I'm very
thankful for that and I'm going shopping
we passed by garage and I saw this scarf
look in the window and I was like oh my
gosh I need it and it has red and blue
and green and you can see I don't know I
just think it's really pretty I guess
it's like a plaid pattern I realized
this style of it like the cut of it like
it's really big and it's super super
soft too and wander of something bad so
there was only one left on that
mannequin that I saw and I was like I
really want it I just like pulled it off
the mannequin like I don't know if that
was bad but I just knew I really wanted
it so yeah then the next thing I got I
don't even want to talk about makes me
so sad so you guys know I wear like
pearl earrings like every day I just
never take them out and I've always just
gotten like really cheap fake pearls
from like forever 21 or you know places
like that but then I was like you know I
wear them every day and also do they
started to kind of hurt my ears like the
fake ones because I think like the cheap
like metal was like irritating my ears
so I was like okay I'm just gonna like
invest in real pearls and just go for it
and buy some so to Macy's and I was like
I'm going to get some real like
freshwater pearls and I did
and literally oh I'm so dumb so my
favorite ones are the big ones and
there's only one
hmm well stupid Gretchen wore the big
ones and one of them fell out and I
searched and searched and I couldn't
find it and I'm really upset and Justin
told me he knew that would happen and it
did so you were right and yeah it's just
really upsetting so right now I have
with the medium-sized ones and and I
don't get me wrong I still really like
them I just like the way the bigger ones
look so it's really sad that that one's
gone but in hopes that I find it someday
I'm keeping the other one and also came
with these really little pair and I like
little ones - I just like the way bigger
ones look better and these are just like
medium ones like I said so yeah that's
really sad the big ones gone but I
definitely think it's like a good
purchase if you can keep track of them
and if you were pearls a lot because
then I think it's like worthwhile so I
am happy that I got them and I really
hope that I find the other big pearl the
last few places we went to a Rhetor
secret pink
American Eagle in Northeast at Northeast
I knew I wanted this black hat for a
while I actually used to have this black
hat and it's just like a knit hat that
has these strings in the pom-poms any
big pom-pom at the top I love it cuz
it's so fuzzy on the inside I seriously
love it and like I said I had it before
but one of these pom-poms actually fell
off so I was really sad and I know I
need to get a new one and yeah I just
love it I'm super happy that I got it
here's what it looks like on so yeah I
love this hat you know I'm just gonna
keep it on for us - this whole video it
was hat is making me in the Christmas
mood a little chain
all right focus crocheting here almost
done we just ran in slick Victoria's
Secret and I was like I should get some
Phoenix and I got this plain white
v-neck and you know it's just basics and
then I got it in for a screen too and I
like this for screen color too
I'm get really pretty so you can never
have it too many basic shirts and in the
very last thing I have to show you is
just this dress from American Eagle just
this cream dress it has some like
crochet detail right there and has all
these layers and I seriously think this
is just so cute
