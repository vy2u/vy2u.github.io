little sentence at the beginning of
every haul video with that but I really
do have an exciting comedy for you guys
because I've been wanting to show you
guys all of this stuff from Jim shark
for so long it's literally overflowing
in this bag right now yes you're not
subscribed already make sure your
subscribe down below so that you're
notified when I post new videos I'll
look at this video a thumbs up if you
like whole videos especially for Jim
shark I mean come on guys come on it's
Jim's right we all know I'm obsessed
with their clothes the first thing I got
is just this red tank top and this color
is literally beautiful guys I'm so
obsessed this is probably my actually
definitely my favorite color just of
clothes that Jim shark has released it's
just as beautiful like heathered red and
I love this style of tank top for
working out but my favorite style of
shirts to work out in has to be this
little short sleeve version of the shirt
just because I talked about this when I
showed Jem shark clothes affordable
video but I like working out in short
sleeve shirts just because when I bite
my ponytail doesn't get sweaty on my
back it would with the tank top so I
like these short sleeve shirts but again
I still like wearing ten cups especially
if I know I'm gonna be really hot if I'm
running outside or something but yeah
this is definitely my favorite style of
shirt to work out in this exact one in
this color I'm going to work out in this
afternoon I can't wait and before I
forget to mention I will have it Jim
shark link down below guys obviously
everything in this videos from Jim
sharks we're not like paying me to make
this video like I'm making it solely
because I want to you guys know I just
love Jim shark and I am so funny I'm
making my Jim shark vs. little lemon
video because I know a bunch of you
requested that and now that I have so
much apparel from both lines I think I
can really like compare and contrast I
mean like let you guys know what I think
like I said I definitely check out Jim
shark link down below you can find all
these products and because it helped
support me I love being able to be an
affiliate with Jim shark because I'm so
obsessed with their products and I feel
so lucky and blessed that I'm able to
you so if you guys use my link it just
helped support me then this tank top I
got is it definitely my next favorite
thing I showed this in the vlog I posted
recently when I was going to SoulCycle
but this is just a gray you're like
muscley style tank top and I love the
detail in the front with that little
opening but by far my favorite is the
back now it just says Jim shark down the
back then for more tank tops I got this
blue tank top it's just like this really
pretty aqua blue it's all like open in
the back I
design and I got the same one in this
beautiful like light purple color I love
light purple like recently I've been
noticing everything like purple and I
think it's so pretty and in the same
light purple color I got a different
style tank top this one's so cool I love
the material because it's really thin
and like breathable but this one's super
unique because the sides are all open
same style of that purple tank top I
also got in what the really thin
breathable one it's just open on the
sides and then this style tank top I've
been trying to get my hands on it's like
they're always sold out on Jim shark
it's just this like medium royal blue
TBT and you guys remember when I was
obsessed with royal blue like literally
everything I got had to be royal blue I
still love royal blue but this is so
unique cuz it's like the ribbon tank top
so it like ties up underneath I think
this is so cool I just got a short
sleeve v-neck like this it's like
tighter like form-fitting and it's
actually been black and I love about I
just got it in gray it's like this
cropped little tight tank top almost
right doing like a sports bra but it's
like longer obviously you can wear with
like high waisted leggings I got a cute
little matching set of like sweatpants
and sweatshirt and they're both
obviously like really athletic so you
can like wear them to work out and still
and these are just gray ones
with pink details I actually have this
in gray and black already and I love
them I wear them as like a little set
the other day I never in my series like
you're so cute you're like matching and
they're just like mesh on the back of
the knees pink on the bottom like that
and a sweater is just this little
quarter zip zip up then I got two pairs
of sweatpants and I haven't had any Jim
shark sweatpants before you want to try
them out I'll let guys know what I think
I just got these at grey ones or just
like this jogger style thing a little
bit tighter at the bottom and they're
super soft and fuzzy on the inside I can
little again put these on like right now
and then I also got them in just the
black color full weight they're a little
bit different to the grey ones have to
Jim shark logo right there but then the
black ones say like Jim shark with a
little logo so they're a little bit
different but you know what these are
different because these are like
straight-up sweatpants the gray ones and
these are more like workout jogger II
type ones only
the inside isn't even really fuzzy it's
just more like joggers I don't know
they're just different styles and these
have zippers on the bottom and pockets
in the back and the other ones don't
so just kidding they were different I
thought they were the same than this I'm
so obsessed with definitely another one
my favorites over to class Co day and I
actually had a bunch of confidence on it
people said they really liked the color
and again it's beautiful like aqua blue
color the exposure isn't even up right
now I just turned it down but can you
see on the front it just has a little
gym short Glo go in the same color is
the sweatshirt and what I love about it
is that it's cropped because I just
think it makes it really unique and
different and I wore it with
high-waisted cool women leggings and it
was just perfect then I got this black
zip-up hoodie and I actually this
ingrained little ready I would always
wear this to and from the gym in the
mornings when I go work out hey Tay I'm
actually filming in Taylor's room right
now thanks Taylor if you're watching
this for letting me film in your room
and it just says Jim shark right there I
like their stuff because oh by the way I
get a small on everything and I like
that it's like tighter fitting on me
because are there working out like
tighter form-fitting stuff that makes
sense I know people are like different
so depending on that you might want like
size up or size down you have some
bottoms the first bones I got are just
these at purple leggings I never got
purple leggings from them of course this
is really exciting
and what I love about this style is that
they have pockets in the side can I ran
outside in these and I could put my
phone like in the side so I love that
and I go a little bit higher up then I
just got these navy blue leggings which
at first might look a little funny at
first I was like oh I don't know how I
feel about the top like looking like
that like they look like little kids
pants I don't know but these were again
it's so good for running in and they
have a little Jim shark logo at the
bottom they kind of remind me of the fit
like things you guys know those are my
favorite ones from Jim sharp the fit
ones are just so amazing because on the
inside of the band they have like this
sticky thing that helps like keep them
up when you're running and I also just
feel like they really like suck in your
legs and they make it someone around my
thighs don't hit which I like it sounds
like so weird but I like that because
it's just like easier to run but these
really reminded me of the fit like they
just fit like really form-fitting
super-good workout out highly recommend
then I just got these blue shorts these
are different is lounging around them I
guess you can work out on them too but I
kind of considered them more as like
lemon shorts and I believe I've is in
black or like gray already so I know I
like these I really just like wear them
to sleep then I got these like spandex
shorts and this is really exciting I
haven't been able to wear them yet
obviously the tag is still on but I'm
really excited to try these out for
running or yoga or biking whatever the
movies will be good for biking because
I've never tried it like gym charcoal
short like spandex but these look just
like the fit legging except for in
spandex form that's the sticky band on
the inside that I love guys oh I'm so
excited to wear these now see I have
these lugging form but you just look
like you cut off the legs and they're
like short forms and in the last pants I
got are just these really cool printed
leggings I don't even know what I would
call this it's definitely not like
tie-dye you can just see the print for
yourself I thought I saw some in my soul
cycle class wearing pants like these the
other day I thought they were cool so
excited to wear those me I forgot to
show you guys sure it was hiding I got
this black long-sleeve shirt from gym
jerk which I'm really excited about too
because I have long sleeves from gym
shark but they're all this sort of like
breathable like dry fit materially now
and this one's more of like normal shirt
cottony materials and then the very last
thing I got from gym shark is just this
bag which I'm already obsessed with just
a really nice a black double bag again
with my favorite to aqua blue like mint
detailing on the inside is just mint and
there's like a big strap so that instead
of using this you could have like a big
one to go like over your shoulder you
know that is everything I got from Jim
shark I really hope you guys enjoyed
because I'm obsessed with literally
everything I wear them every day when I
go to the J I'm going to go to yoga and
I go to SoulCycle
