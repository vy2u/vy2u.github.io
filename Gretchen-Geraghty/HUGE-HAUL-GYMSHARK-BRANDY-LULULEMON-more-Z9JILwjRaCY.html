whole video for you guys and the first
things I'm going to be showing you are
some athletic wear which is really
exciting to talk about because you guys
know I'm so into working out I love when
to the gym I go every morning actually
wore these learnings to the gym this
morning
I picked these out of the hamper but
anyway all the first clothes I'm going
to be showing you are from my gym shark
and if you guys have been following
along on my blog channel which by the
way if you haven't you should totally go
subscribe
it's got fan Lucy and Josh you're not
just kind of - at this channel you
always show as you can see this
wonderful face nook anyway
sanrak Gretchen I should have - all of
my gym chuckles I have sugar
does that look formerly hold any of the
items raving about them on my blog
channel for so long so I just want to
like show them in this video so the
first things I'm going to be showing you
around my gym shark are the Flex
leggings because I know these are like
the most coveted and like saw out
leggings and these are the leggings that
are always about I always get tweed
presages and comments and people being
like where the flood clogging we really
want them lucky for you early viewers
there's a resaw of the Flex leggings
tomorrow so keep your eye out so you can
get those if you've been wearing them
cuz I know so many people have been
wanting them and I know there's some
color that I didn't want to I have that
it's like light purple and then it has a
pink and purple waistband I'm actually
obsessed with these leggings from Jim
shark because I just love the shaping
that goes on the side are such good
quality so that guys Lululemon and watch
out like literally dudes are so amazing
and it's are so affordable like these
are way cheaper than the lemon and other
brands up and actually comment on my
must receive vlogs like Gretchen you
should do a little lemon bridges at Jim
shark video just comparing them so if
you guys want that video please thumbs
up this video so I know that you want
that because I think that would be
really interesting to make and my Hubble
for you guys guys have them in all black
and these I literally wear all the time
actually got two more pairs of plugins
right after I filmed this holidays I
wanted to include down these gray ones
with the blue top and then I got darker
blue or gray pair with like a light gray
top and I love them
alright then the next one bad to show
you guys are the fit leggings and I feel
like these don't get as much love on
like social media just like everyone
likes the flex ones but I truly love
these I will need to a colored one yet
because I like just got them in the mail
but they're just this all teal color
which like the main screen
AQUATOP you know I think a lot of these
two souls into action but to go to
SoulCycle onto this my favorite thing
about these guys is the fit of them and
where these it to the gym this morning
dude it's all black ones with the black
intended tub and I actually think these
are like sample ones and I don't know if
you can read them yet because they have
like the logo on the front and I know
they're like trying that out to see how
people like that personally I really
like the logo on the front of the reason
I love this it is these so much is
Arnold you can tell does that one look
tighter fitting than the Flex legging so
these fit leggings I would keep getting
in a size small all the flesh ones I
might go down to an every small just cuz
like I said I like them really tight
they tight around my thighs which I
don't know if this is going to sound
weird but when I run it either of my
thighs aren't like hitting each other
because I feel like I can go faster and
it's just less annoying if that makes
sense really relating is you don't have
talking about so specifically these fit
leggings I noted kind of stuck in my
thighs and when I run a size don't hit
so really like running in these webs and
I also just have them in the all black
with the purple top and see I think
these are the ones that are on their
website with like the logo right there
and these ones I just got are like newer
and they have the logos down on the shin
by the way I will say before I get
through on my gym shark stuffs but it's
linked down below it is always linked
down below I just left it there because
they're like my favorite workout clothes
and I do work with gym sharks all these
clothes are sent to me which is so nice
I'm so thankful because I love them so
much as a brand I love being able to
work with them and show you guys my
favorite workout clothes because truly I
workout in them all the time and I would
say they are acid or better than lemon
oh and also I got a question on all of
these leggings I just showed you I was
getting tweets of people asking if they
are see-through I've never had an issue
with those being see-through I would
have noticed if they are and they're not
so that's really great too and sadly I
don't like a coupon code for you guys to
use but what should help is that gym
shark is generally really not that
expensive at all their clothes are very
affordable but if you use my link it
just helped me out and helps me be able
to keep working with them and it helps
for me so yeah thank you guys so much
for using my link and then for long
sleeve shirts I just have this one long
sleeve look heathered blue on love
working out and I not supposed to
picture my Instagram and then again like
with the shaping on this I don't know it
just like sucks you in all the right
places and I love also is that it has
like the whole and arm screen put your
thumb through Neron for short-sleeved
shirts I just had a couple I have two in
this type the first one is
same color that long-sleeve on it just
like the heathered blue short sleeve you
guys know i don't know if you know
specifically these short sleeve shirts
are my favorite types to work out in by
far I like working out and hangs up I
don't like when I bike and I can feel my
ponytail kidding so gross hitting my
back when I'm biking and my back is all
sweaty in my hair like fixed my back
because weather just wear like a short
sleeve shirt like this these are by far
my favorite shirts to work out in I also
just have it in the pink color this is
so cute let's have two of these cotton
ones I've actually worked out in this
blue one before it just says Jim shark
such a super stretchy and comfy this is
a black v-neck with the gym Trek logo
they just have it one sports bra it just
says heather gray one really lived in
this I'm going to break it home look I
didn't take it off the whole month and
that's the only sports row but this is
almost like the sports for a little bit
it's like this cropped tank top I would
say that you honestly cuz we're in the
fourth row it's just all black and says
that Jim shark on the bottom and I love
the back you just all open and mesh that
anaphoras tank tops I just have three
this one I love working out and I will
run it as a bunch not bike anymore
because I realized what I'd like in tank
tops my hair gets just my sweaty back so
isn't this what is really unique and
different I've just worn it like
casually because it's more of this like
thin it's like really lightweight and
it's all open on the side so that is
like really cool and you could wear like
a cool bro let with it and it's purple
and I haven't even worn it I would pull
in the back again it's news which
haven't had a chance to wear yet alright
nearing the end of a gym sharks tub I
just have it some sweatshirts and one
pair of sweatpants to show you so this
one I know I also wore in vlogmas it's
just a zip up Hoodie blue and gray this
is more tight-fitting and people have
asked me a lot about sizing currently I
have a small in all of these things and
for the future I might go size down and
the flood flooding just because I feel
like I could date an extra small to fit
ones I'll probably keep getting a small
bar sweatshirts and sweatpants I feel
like they're a little bit more tight
like form-fitting which makes sense
look if you want to work out in them
what about one with and casually I might
want them to be a little more oversized
in baggies I might go sign ups like a
medium oh also for reference I'm 5 9 I
don't know
how soon anyway a girl was asking me on
Twitter I remember - I'm five-eleven do
you think these lessons will be long
enough on me and yeah I think they will
because even a small like I'm five nine
and they're long enough and I know
they'd be long enough unfilled honest
5:11 well I just have it visit quarters
it which is black and I actually did
work out in this once before so it's
good that it's like tight-fitting
because working out more tight stuff
it's not like moving all over the place
it's comfy hoodie it's like very sick in
material
it says Jim shark right up here passing
out to show you guys drama Jim shark or
sees a black jogger sweatpants and then
in the back there Grand in the bottom
and have like the mesh behind the knees
so it's perfect with that quarter zip
and I've actually worn them together
before and I feel like so cool in my
little outfit as you can tell I'm
obsessed with Jim shark I can't talk
about them enough I'd love to do more
videos just talking about them and like
comparing the quality to lemon for
example so again some census videos you
want that and don't forget I will have a
jig charcoal to sit down below so you
can check out all these things and
anything else you might want and don't
forget that tomorrow they will have a
retox of the Flex legging so literally
keep your eyes out then the next step I
have to show you I'm also so excited out
I really love everything I'm showing in
this holiday today stuff from ivory Ella
you guys know I'm a longtime fan of
ivory Ella I still got this horn stuff
from them for like years now it is like
the first video of mine you're watching
you're off the hook but the rest of you
should know dive obsessive elephant
Charlie my elephant coloca is back there
they just make me so happy and a vlog
recently I was like flipping out I was
so excited that I got this Ramana
Briella and again I'm so grateful that
they were able to send it to me but
they're not only paying me to say this
or anything I just really want to show
you guys what I got so therefore that
they donate money to elephants
so yes the first thing I got are just
these elephant earrings which are so
cute and I can't wait to put them in I'm
literally ready to put them in right now
so i just got this white ivory ella hat
and has a light green Elson right there
this isn't me perfect to run in because
I actually love running in baseball caps
outside so I got to walk is from ivory
Ella and I've never tried out their
watches so this is like so fun so I got
this white one and I got this brown one
they just have like a little elephant at
the top may say I reel it in the middle
then for surance I got two short sleeve
shirts I got this orange one and I love
the back of this one I just think it's
so pretty it has like the open in the
middle and some chevron detail
I also thought this is like a dark red
which I think I lost somewhere because I
wore it so much so I really hope I find
it it has got it short sleeve light blue
one
again the LFA and CJ on the front is a
little pocket it's all been so cute on
the back the print is so beautiful will
be perfect to wear around you can
sleeping on you can work out now you can
wear them to class like leggings I don't
even know how to describe this green
color but it's more of like a dark pale
grayish cream and again it has its back
that I really love and this one features
I got is so fine that this pink tie-dye
one and it just has the black elephant
on the back and then last year I got my
real long sleeve a purple one in the
back is so beautiful on this one look
it's a design oh and then I forgot to
show it just this necklace the little
elephant at the bottom so cute so I
definitely recommend everything from
ivory Ella or it folks we're nearing Mia
and thanks for sticking with me so when
I went to New York City recently I just
got a couple things from brandy melville
and actually the first thing I got I'm
wearing right now it's just this grey
long-sleeve thermal shirt is that what
this material is called stretchy and so
comfortable I love this if you guys have
seen looking my out for the week so
maybe even another haul video too
I actually have this and it gray and it
may be blue stripes and if you know me
you know that when I love something and
I get it I get it in like every color
because because I just love it and
always want to wear it and then I found
that they have it in white too so
obviously have to get the white one
going with the theme of comfort I got
this pur outfit okay if you're a near
brandy melville I challenge you to go to
their store and see all this material it
is so soft first I found this
long-sleeve v-neck oversized sweater
that was just the softest most comfiest
material ever and then I saw that they
had it in the sweatpants version and
honestly if you're doing you could wear
about and the very last thing I just
show you guys it wouldn't be a GLD whole
video without some Lululemon we stopped
by the women and I found these black
leggings on sale and I was like ol girl
they were only like 79 on sale which I
know I was like still way too much me
guys know not only their leggings are
forgetting hundreds on the dollars
who else has notice they're steady a
price increases I'm like I'm not a
Lululemon I forget to style of what
these are called but honestly you
probably answer them anyway because I
got them on like sale you know they just
look like this and I can't have the mesh
like crossing behind your cast in the
back also it's a cut the bottom isn't
like straight across it's kind of like
diagonals I think it's like really
different whoa wow that took me a while
to get through at all hope you guys
enjoyed the good lighting - because my
studio lights really have made it such a
difference I can film like wherever I
want whenever I want 5:00 p.m. it's
getting dark but you can't even tell
maybe you can know yeah that is
everything I just show you guys it was
home video I really hope you enjoyed
again you can find the links to
everything to list them below thank you
so much for watching I'll see my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
