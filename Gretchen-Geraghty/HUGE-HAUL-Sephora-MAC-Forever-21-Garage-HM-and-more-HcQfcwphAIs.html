be a haul video some of this stuff that
I've recently got from like the mall and
I did order off of Sephora after my
birthday because I got a bunch of gift
cards and stuff like that
first I'll just show you some of the
makeup that I got from Sephora first I
got this like glam glow mass and I
actually had it put on me before at
Sephora and I know that I love it I'll
just open it up so you can see it smells
really good and it's um I don't know I
just loved it the way it makes your skin
it makes it really pretty and like glowy
and it with pulls the bad things out of
your skin like when it dries it's kind
of light grey in color and then there's
like black spots on your face and that's
like where it pulls all the bad things
out of your skin so I like love that
next I got some stuff from NARS and I
got the the NARS Laguna bronzer and yeah
I just really like this it's just like a
nice brown bronzer I don't know it's not
shiny so I like that and then I got the
NARS blush in orgasm and Angelica like
Angelica's like hot pink and then orgasm
is like a light peachy pink so I really
like those and then also from Sephora I
got this face wash from on philosophy
it's called purity and I really really
love this face wash face wash face wash
it smells so good and it smells like
lemons and my kind of herbal and it
takes off all your makeup I really
really love that and then from Sephora I
also got the coralista blush brown what
benefit and I don't know it's just a
really pretty like coral color and
everyone says it smells like
strawberries and it kind of does so
that's really cool also from Sephora I
got the Make Up For Ever HD foundation
I'm in the shade 120 so umm 120 is kind
of dark um I don't know if you can tell
but she matched it to me and I guess I
am
funny so I don't know if yeah but yeah I
just I really like this I mean it's nice
good foundation and as I kind of
mentioned before my birthday was March
11th so I got the birthday little set
from Sephora and this year or yeah this
year it's with their real and what's up
from benefit so I got the mini like
they're real mascara which I'm wearing
today and I actually really like it and
I got the what's up highlighter it's so
little but um I really really like this
- it's kind of like shimmery and I'm
wearing it so when I run out of those I
might have to like repurchase them also
from Sephora I got the Dior Addict lip
glow and it's like a mirror package that
you can see it let me it looks like that
and it's really I don't know packaging
schools it's like light pink and it
makes your lips look pretty like to
think so yeah yeah I really like this
and then the last thing I got from
Sephora was the Beauty Blender and I
really really really like this it's dry
right now and when it's dry it's kind of
like it's small but then right as you
get it with water it gets like really
big and you just like a bringing out you
put on your foundation and I really like
using this with this so if you want to
see like a foundation routine with these
two just let me know and I can probably
do that
so yeah I really like that - okay also I
went to Mac right in the bags really
loud and I got just two eyeshadows I got
the eye shadow
all that glitters yeah sorry it's up
through the packaging but it's kind of
like a gold shimmery color and then I
got the eyeshadow in Naked Lunch and I
get it kinda reminds me of like sin from
Urban Decay so I really like that
they're both just kind of like light
shimmery like lid colors though I
thought and then it from hmm I got this
black circle skirt that I love love love
it looks oh there's a buzz Eastern uh
yeah okay it looks like that it's just a
black circle skirt and I'm excited to
wear this not only like in the spring in
summer but still right now it's still
kind of winter here I can write with
like tights and flats and like stuff
like that and then I'm also preaching
them I just got these like cool little
sunglasses because you know like I feel
like I've been looking for these
sunglasses for awhile because I'm too
cheap to buy the ray-bans ones um and
yeah I like these
so yeah next from River 21 I got this
dress I love it's just light blue and
white like stripes I feel like this is
not from perversion like it doesn't even
look like you get this there do you know
what I mean like it doesn't look like
it's from there um but I just really
really really like this it's kind of
like fancy but I can also wear it to
school and there's like a zipper right
there
and there's like a little cutout in the
back and I just think it's so adorable
so I'm really happy I got that and then
okay big pants and I just tell you a
little sort of really quick they were um
they're like light pink and white some
jeans you know like just any jeans and
they're like a little bit high C but not
really like I don't know just like a
little and um I have I have shorts from
there and they're like too small so I
knew I knew I was a size like 26 but
they didn't have any 26 as then we had
25 and I knew that thought was like too
tight for me there on a mannequin so I
asked him to take it off the mannequin
and the guy was literally struggling
with the mannequin for like 10 minutes
trying to get them off and he ended up
breaking the mannequin to get these
pants from me so you know why I like had
to buy that because and what there's so
much to get that so I really like those
pants and I'm gonna wear them all and
like this bringing stuff okay then from
Abercrombie I got this really big look
oversized sweater and it's a bunch of
different colors as you can see in blue
and stuff and it smells so good I just
love it and I know it's kind of um like
getting to be spring and stuff but it's
a really cool here so I can definitely
wear them and yeah so I really like this
oh my gosh it smells so good the last
thing I got was from garage and I'm so
happy I got this
if this are navy blue military jacket
and I love it so much and I'm gonna wear
a lot like transitioning in just brings
some so say that I got this and yeah so
