video and it's actually another back to
school haul I have like a lot of stuff
to show you I have some stuff from like
the outlets when I went my Vineyard
Vines Banana Republic j.crew I except
from Lululemon of course
probies surprise ever come me I also
have some ivory Ella to share with you
which is really exciting because I've
been wanting to show you guys what I got
from there for a while now but the first
thing I have to talk about is actually
just this app that I've been using it so
much recently and it's called cinch it
like cinch poles I've literally been
using it all the time like especially
for Instagram that's when I use a lot
because I always can never decide what
Instagram picture to put up when I try
to make an Instagram post so app itself
just looks like that it's just that
green little app and so what cinches is
basically like a one voting app for all
your like image based questions and it's
perfect when you want the opinions of
your friends for like your best
hairstyle or Instagram filter or outfit
to wear so like it's just like this you
can just click like one side so like I
chose that outfit is an example also
it's just a really easy way to get a
bunch of pictures together to get a
quick vote from your friends on which
picture they like the best
also it's free which is really nice and
it's available in the App Store so I'll
have that link down below if you're
interested and how's that you guys can
go I might make sure that I just posted
my account is that Gretchen Garrity and
you can tell me which Instagram stuff
that you like better because I'm still
trying to decide what picture I like
better to put up and I've been doing so
many halls but I've been getting so many
closures from back-to-school since it's
going to be a freshman in college and
there's actually giving me a haul posted
the day after you're seeing this so
sorry there's gonna be like two in a row
like literally the day after one another
this is gonna be the first one and I
want to show you so I'm really just
gonna get into it now when I went to the
outlet so one place I went to has been
yard vines and the first thing I have to
show you is actually on this hanger
because it's this fancy dress and it's
been hanging up because I actually
didn't realize but it's 100% silk it
shows this pink shift dress and I really
like it is it so different and unique
from all the other dresses I have
because it's like more loose fitting and
like a little bit longer I'm really just
obsessed with this dress there have to
be really careful with it - because silk
you have to dryclean I just have to be
careful with it look now so honey you
know there's a little bow on the back so
I love this
the other thing I got from Vineyard
Vines is just this lanyard it's navy
blue it says Vineyard Vines and it has
cute pink little wheels on it oh and
then interpreting the stuff that I got
from the outlets I'm actually gonna show
you the two trips I got for my reality
because I'm seriously obsessed with em
and money talking about them forever
I've been waiting to show them in this
whole video and what the things were
actually said to me thank you so so much
I really you don't know how happy I am
like I was going to buy them anyway so
I'm so happy that you like found my
channel and liked me enough to send them
to me because I'm literally obsessed
with elephants all of you know that if
you've watched my videos for a while so
the first time I got is just this yellow
whole long-sleeve line and it has a cute
little elephant on the pocket in the
front and then it has a blue little
design on the back and the next one I
got it's like the same long-sleeve style
it's just teal with the white little
outfit on the front and then it has
orange tribal pink elephant on the back
and seriously guys I'm obsessed with me
he's like I wanna buy every single color
you don't even know what there is so
cute
coming to j.crew and I got this bracelet
which i think is so cute and I don't
have any jewelry like this it's just
like a goal like shaking and it has some
cool diamonds on it might be like sorry
for my appearance in this video my hair
is just like salty pool hair I was
lifeguarding all day and this is how it
turned out the next thing I got from
j.crew is actually this fence it's
really really cold at Boston University
where I'm going to school in the fall
thing this one's it's so cute I've
actually wanted like I threw a print
this is cold I forget I've always
thought that print a vest was really
cute and I've only ever seen it in black
actually but this is actually a good
dark gray so I thought that was a
different and unique and also another
thing to be wary when you're buying
these is I heard they weren't really big
the distance actually a extra small or
is it an extra extra small I don't know
one of the two like they weren't really
big so just be careful of that in the
last place I'm not too at the outlets
was actually Banana Republic and the
first thing I got are these elephant
boxers because look I said I'm obsessive
elevate you guys already know but
they're just navy blue with some grey
elephants and I think they're really
cute and I'm gonna wear a lot to sleep
and the next thing I got banana republic
is just this scarf and it's so cute it
kind of purple you're in our camera
but it's more like a periwinkle bluish
purple in person and it kinda like fades
in different spots and is like lighter
and darker wow it looks helper flirt now
but I swear it's a purpley blue and then
the next things I got from Banana
Republic are actually just these
earrings they're like square diamonds
they're just like crystals and they're
seriously so if you like I've been
wearing them like crazy and I think they
instantly make you look fabulous is that
just me I don't know I think I got from
Banana Republic
I actually was leaving and I looked back
and I was like I need that it's just as
gray and black long sleeve sweatshirt
hoodie type thing it's just like right
on the top like that and the bottom is
all black and I'm really sorry I think I
forgot to try this on so I'm really
sorry about that I'm going to jump into
American Eagle because I just have two
things to show you ever say I'm to show
you is actually this royal blue dress
every way right now and it's actually
like a t-shirt type dress I don't even
know if it's supposed to be a t-shirt
but I wear it as a dress because it's
like big and long and I just think it's
really cute and I love everything that's
royal blue so okay I have to get this so
you came back from American Eagle is
actually these are dark wash jeggings
with a bunch of riffs and I wanted these
for so long I can't even tell you but I
just never got them sounds like Oh kinda
expensive really need them but I've
always wanted I mean you're so cute and
I actually got them from Lucifer and I
hit a hundred thousand subscribers so
thank you so much let's say you're the
best and you know me so well I need
another one of these Wow I think this
hall is jumping all over the place sorry
I just have stuff from like everywhere
so yeah oh let's just show you this
stuff I got from Nike
so the first thing I got are just these
white shorts which I know my feeling
crazy and like so many people were like
rushing those are gonna get so dirty but
like I don't even care I think they're
so cute like I just wanted of hair of
white ones I saw that at the Nike store
when I was in Boston for Marathon Monday
during Boston Marathon sorry that's not
topic but anyway I saw them and I just
thought they were so cute and I wanted
them ever since and so I decided to
order them online and I couldn't be
happier because these are my favorite
type of shorts workout and I think
they're called
tiempo or tempo or something keeps your
wondering I think that's a good call are
they I don't know but basically I just
love that I'm and I don't care if
they're gonna get dirty because I I just
love them
so I guess knowing with that theme is
these white Roshi's I thought and I
actually I saw these white crochets on
like some Fitness Instagram girls
and I was like I need that and I just
order them right away because I just
thought they were adorable but basically
they're just plain white roshi run
sneakers and I've never tried running in
the row shoes they're working out and
then and I have to say I'm a fan I
really like it because they're only
pretty free runs I actually a bunch of
those they're really pretty and they
look really nice but they really don't
have that much support if you're doing
exercises that have like strain on your
knees or your joints with your legs you
know like if you run for me there just
aren't really good to run in because
they're just so thin so I like ones of
them are support so these are the
perfect for me to run in and I actually
really enjoy running in these but I just
have to be careful with them because
they're all white so so far my fan of
these puppies thumbs up this video if
you're an eight and a half like me whoo
n even if you're not still thumbs up the
video but I got a bunch of stuff in a
little lemon guys it's an obsession like
it literally has to stop like my bank
account is empty because of Lululemon if
someone from Lululemon is seeing this
all my money goes to you I'm not kidding
so the first thing I got from the lemon
are just these black leggings and I have
wanted this exact pair of leggings for
so long I kid you not
I'm like seven pictures to Lucy and be
like our eyes I need these for the past
like months but so they're basically
just the long black like wonder owners
but they're special because they have
like this floral kind of design at the
top and I just thought they were like so
unique in different and I just always
saw them online and I finally came in
purchased them and are also reversible
so you can run like this if you want and
just have that would be like black you
know just like non black ones I'm so
happy I got those honestly that's
precious
ever then I ordered a two-block tank top
side the first one is just is playing
black when it has like skinny straps and
then the back is so cool I'd like the
prettiest cool like cross he designed in
the back hanging so cute I were at
Canadian Henley when I was practicing
one name so that's fun and the other
black teamed up i got looks like this
the straps are like a tiny bit thicker
but they're still like pretty thin i
mean and then the back has a really cool
design and there's like some mesh and it
kind of like crosses and whatnot and
yeah more black tank tops boohoo but
like obviously they'll be so good to
work out in
and I have any excuse I do work out a
lot like I'll be rolling for the next
four years at you so it's good that I
have a bunch we're getting close then I
got two more pairs of pins Hulu women
the first one is just these black ones
and I'm actual and these black ones for
a while too and I bought these like a
couple months ago but I forgot to show
them in a hall so I'm showing them now
and I actually don't even think they're
on your website anymore it summarizes
are about that I want to say they're
called like skinny wills skinny grooves
something like that but they're just
black like straight pants they were like
a little bit more Flair II than my
name's I would say but there's still
like pretty tight fitting like just they
just going straight down so they kind of
like punch at the bottom like I like
that look that's why I wanted them and
these ones actually go with a little bit
high waisted so sometimes I kind of roll
them over even though I don't think
you're supposed to but I like the way
that looks too and I really have any
about those because I don't have ones
like that I pretty much just have
leggings from there so these will be
good I can probably work out in them or
just buy them like casually then I got
these little cropped leggings cuz
actually now I have any cropped leggings
from the lemon until now and they're
just like the dark green ones and lucy
has these and like the full-length pants
and I've always thought they were so
cute when I saw them in cropped I was
like yes and then I have some swimsuits
from it tonight for swimwear the first
one I have to show you is just all black
it's just the all black neoprene line
and the top just looks like this very
basic just all black and it's like
really thick neoprene it's like really
good material just like the triangle
style bottom just look like this again
all black like really thick neoprene and
I really haven't ties like that I like
the thin straps on the side I think I've
said that before in videos because I
like not having bad like Tama and so
really like this next one I got from my
deck for swimmer is this white and pink
one I kind of like it mixed and matched
the top is just like this it's white it
has some lace and I think it's really
cute
since the bottoms or just these basic
pink ones and I actually think I forgot
to fill in these too Wow sorry guys I
meant to show everything on but I
thought they didn't show these yeah
like the basic pink ones but a little
bit cheeky in the back and it was really
good with that way top and then pretty
much everything else I have to show you
is from Abercrombie except for this
actually which I'll just show you right
now it's from Urban Outfitters it's just
like the Calvin Klein basic gray sports
bra I actually ordered this forever ago
from Urban Outfitters but it just came
because it was like backward so I think
this is really cute I honestly not gonna
lie some pictures are all really Twitter
and Instagram I think that's a fad now
to show pictures of yourself in my
Calvin Klein underwear I promise you can
help me to this I'm not going to be
posting pictures like look at me in my
Calvin's like no I'm not gonna do that
actually so comfortable but yeah I
ordered underwear this too and it still
didn't come it said it's gonna shave
like September 10th
I literally ordered it like July so
still waiting on my underwear that's
okay I'll just show you what I have
remember coming down so the first thing
I have is just this navy blue and white
striped dress and actually show this in
my walk with mercy Gabby when Lucy and I
went shopping with them like I said it's
just a navy blue and white striped dress
but it's actually from Abercrombie kids
so that's really fun I don't really know
how to feel about that I can still
pinned ever coming kids and I'm 19 but
you know super like soft like
comfortable material too so that's
always nice and then this I like
literally so happy that I got like I
wanted a really nice like dark green
military jacket for a while now and just
have like some pockets and there's like
long I don't know it's like exactly what
I was looking for kind of like ties at
the waist and it's like not too heavy
but not too light it's like the perfect
weight of material I would say I
actually just realized I show these
jeans that I got in the haul video with
Tasha and Lucy but I threw them in this
pile because I thought I didn't show you
yet so I guess I'll just talk about them
again I got these highly cities like
medium ish dark wash jeans remember
coming in bitch when I was visiting
Tasha and there's like some rips on them
if you already saw that video here you
could just see them again into the light
and get weird in this or is it just me I
feel like it turned like yellowish okay
I'm really sorry but I actually grabbed
two more things to show you if you're
interested I don't know like I said I'm
Canadian Henley my twin sister Lucia
and illegal so like Congrats Lucy it was
amazing she won in the woman's u19 quad
I got two shirts that kind like I got
this yellow t-shirt that says Empire you
