super exciting haul video for you and
I'm seriously so excited right now
because I think there's just been stuff
like from Sephora that I've wanted for
such a long time that I just haven't
gotten so I was like you know what
cartoons like treat yourself because you
deserve makeup if you want it just
kidding but seriously like I'm so
excited to show you all the stuff that I
got and this big huge box that's right
here came yesterday oh by the way I know
this is going up by Thanksgiving today
is actually Thanksgiving I'm going to
attempt to edit and upload it today like
Gretchen I'm gonna do it I know I am
this time so happy Thanksgiving all of
you that are watching this it's probably
like later at night because this is
already the afternoon but anyway let's
just get on into it okay so the first
thing I'll show you I'm seriously so
excited about and look at how big this
puppy is purity is one of my favorite
face washes from Sephora it's by the
brand philosophy and I seriously love it
so I decided to just go big or go home
and get this huge thing and it's like a
really really good face wash I think
I've talked about this before I actually
remember a haul video back in the days
of glv I remember I got this smaller
thing at purity and I opened it and it
like hit my nose I remember that being
in the haul video and like everyone
thought I was funny since then I've used
like all of that and probably like
another two or three of them I just use
it a lot I've been using a lot of
different face washes but this is just
one of my faves so I decided to just get
this big one and I've been talking about
this for like ten minutes
so moving on it smells really good and
it takes off your makeup cuz I don't
like using makeup remover I just use
that any kind of smells like lemon so
basically I'm obsessed and the next
thing I got is just this little set it's
just like the glam glow set and I'm used
to glam glow a face mask
for a while it was like my favorite but
it's like really little and you kind of
like run out of it quick and it's super
expensive so I decided I would get this
set this time and like try a new one so
it came with like a mini of my favorite
one which is just the super mud clearing
treatment it's like the one that comes
in the white bottle and it seriously
smells so good it's just like the black
to toxifying
mask it also came with this thirsty
cleanse daily hydrating cleanser can I
look at brush too I guess and then let's
a big one it came with is like this is
like the full-size of them and this is
just the blue one
it's the hydrating one so I'm super
excited to use these they seriously make
your skin like so nice
I said she wants to use this right now
so I'll show it to you guys so I just
got this NARS like blush palette I know
they always come out with cool blush
palettes and I'm actually like always
wanted one so I just think they're
really cool then I onto all these colors
so yeah I'm super excited I got this
guy's it has like a bunch of blushes
along the bottom in some bronzers along
the top and I'm actually running the
second one right now on my face I used
to I was getting ready it's called the
blasphemy I think the bronzer on the top
is Laguna which is like one of my
favorite bronzer it's the whole time so
super excited to use this and it's
called NARS Steven Klein I thought this
whole time I thought it was seven kind
I'm so dumb okay yep yeah then the next
thing I got is just this little set of
like Beauty blenders I got like a lot of
sets online because they just seemed
like good deals to me so you know I've
actually had this pink one for a while
now mine was getting kind of old so I
was like I better get a new one but it
also came with a black one which I know
is like the Beauty Blender Pro I don't
know if there's really any difference
other than the color it's so cute so I'm
super excited to use this and I think
you can use it like under your eyes I
think that's what its first since it's
so little and I think this is like a
little cleanser thing that came with it
too so you guys know if you bought it on
Sephora before if you order online you
get like a bunch of free little mini
samples so I just got a bunch of them I
got the benefit gimme brow and I've
actually been using this like I put it
on my dress today
and I seriously love it because it's
like a tinted brow gel and I feel like
in a video recently I asked you guys
like can you like comment down below
good stuff to use for your brows because
I've never filled in my brows and I
noticed so kind of like not that good
they're like some sparse and some areas
that I just never really cared and I was
like maybe I should like try to do some
eyebrow so I really really like this and
I think I'm gonna get the full size
maybe I'll get it tomorrow on Black
Friday it's probably what I'll do I got
the Daisy Dream by Marc Jacobs I
actually used it a couple of times
and it smells really good by lifting
foam cool cool I got ultra Repair Cream
by first a beauty and I've actually had
this like moisturizer before and I
seriously love this it's like a really
really good moisturizer because my skin
gets really dry in colder weather and
then I got the honest - yeah
a powder duo in taupe oh this is what
you guys were telling me to get so if I
like it maybe I'll get like a bigger
thing of it I still have to try this out
though I got the Clinique
takes a day off cleansing balm so that's
cool samples are always trying to try
out because then if you like them you
can get the full thing and don't worry
like I know I got a lot of stuff but
some stuff I got for other people too I
got two of these steal of eyeliners and
you guys know these are like my favorite
eyeliners ever
it's the 24/7 day all day waterproof
liquid eyeliner I just get the black one
and it's seriously the best it's just
like the easiest for me to do my
eyeliner with and I got two of them
because I got one here on it but these
are seriously the best and then for my
friend Hannah I got the bare minerals
just like top ready powder thing let's
open it I actually want to see it just
looks like powder foundation or
something so this is for Hannah oh and
then also bare minerals guys I got the
bare minerals correct and concealer in
light - and I've been needing to get
this for so long because it's like my
favorite concealer ever and I actually
grabbed my old one to show you guys -
how sad is this like it's seriously like
empty I was like scraping it out sounds
like okay like I have to get a new one
look how nice that looks so much better
but yeah it's your slicker this
concealer ever I just like the creamy
like pop concealers because I feel like
they give you the best coverage and I
just use it was like a little concealer
brush and the next thing I got is this
Sephora favorites draw the line
eyeliners sampler because like I said
this is like my favorite eyeliner but I
decided I should try some other ones and
it came with a bunch just looks like
that it came with the Kat Von D one it
came with it's a 4-1 I think an urban
decay one Stila like eyeliner pencil one
a Tarte one in a Smashbox one and then I
don't know if I've talked about this
before I feel like a long time ago maybe
but the dr. jar beauty balm the premium
like plus 1 as Sephora comes in with the
gold package was like my favorite ever I
always used to use it but then I used it
all up and I've been meaning to get a
new one for a while but then I saw this
little set that comes with like four of
the different kinds and I just decided
to get this one so I could try out the
other ones because I've always used this
one which is like really real
good I think this is what the original
and then there's like maybe a hydrating
one and a poor one so yeah and this
thing I'm seriously so excited I got
because I the naked one two and three
pilot and so this one came out like I
think actually maybe a little while ago
and I just didn't like catch up with the
trend until now but I got the naked
smoky palette and I actually did my eyes
with the smoky palette today you guys
liked it let me know maybe I'll do
tutorials something I think I'd never do
PD videos anymore
but for those of you that don't know it
just looks like that it's super pretty
and there's just like yeah a lot of
darker like smokey shades and then I got
this other standby I forgot to show you
it's Texas dry bar shampoo and
conditioner volumizing oh oh I forgot to
show you guys too
I left it in my dorm room I'm like Homer
and everything's giving but I got and
Make Up For Ever HD like finishing
powder it seriously is so soft and like
fine like it makes your skin feel so
soft but yeah I don't have it with me
but I know I love that so yeah and I
just got this Norah's concealer I've
been wanting to try this for a while
because I think I've heard people say
it's good I got it in the shade custard
and I used it under my eyes today and it
has like really good coverage so I'll
probably go gets a full one of this I
just got like the littler size to try it
out and it's so far so good
I just got these hair ties because I've
actually bought these before but you
know you like always lose your hair ties
like if you're like me like they just
disappear so I decided I should get some
more and I think because they don't
leave lines in your hair look especially
I look really thin hair so I feel like
if I put my hair up in a ponytail like I
just get lines in it but these don't
leave a crease so those are awesome and
the last thing I got is just as little
Urban Decay palette and I got it as like
a point reward thing it has like a
little primer potion and I always use
the Urban Decay primer potion like
whenever I do my eyeshadow I've always
done that whole is just cute and it just
has all these little eye shadows so this
will be really nice to travel it's the
urban advices it's just like a little
mini one so yeah that was my whole
Sephora makeup haul and I'm really happy
that I got to show you guys with it guy
and I'm just so excited like try
everything out because I just haven't
bought in makeup in such a long time and
like I used to be really into makeup and
I think I just fried clothes more often
