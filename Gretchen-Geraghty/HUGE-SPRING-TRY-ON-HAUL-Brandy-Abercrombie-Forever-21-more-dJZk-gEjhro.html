spring haul video and I'm so excited to
show you what I got because I've been
shopping a quite a bit in the last few
weeks preparing for the spring in summer
and if you don't recognize where I'm
sitting I'm actually sitting in my like
front little foyer area of my house
because I realized there's some pretty
good lighting up here so that's why it
looks different and yeah without further
ado a weird as what you do it jump right
into everything the first thing I'll
show you are just these shirts that I
customized with this website called qt
they have a bunch of different shirts
like literally so many I looked for
hours on there about like different
shirts even customized there's like
shirts new ones as long-sleeve one
sweatshirt even different styles of tank
tops like crop tops everything like that
and you can also get them in like
different colors and there's so many
prints to choose from and then within
those prints you can change those colors
too and the first thing I got it's just
just like muscley tank top and it has
the little Hamza design it's like a
printed hand looking thing and this
actually reminded me of Tasha my friend
fiercly Tasha if you're watching this
because I know you have stuff that is
like the humza design and then this tank
top I think it's so so cute because I
love the strappy detail in the back how
it looks like a little why like that but
it's just this flowy like taking top
that says eat sleep yoga and I love the
color because it's like this periwinkle
color so I actually customized this
color all by itself you get different
colors on each different word if you
want but I just decided to make a bowl
with this periwinkle color how probably
like where this looking yoga class
because I think it's so cute
and then the last thing I actually got
her underpants which I know is like
weird to show in a haul video
it says sleeping late and pink and then
like darker pink and then purple like
that and all these shirts and everything
are going to be linked down below so you
can definitely go check that out and the
next thing I have to show you are
actually these really really cute
necklace it are perfect for spring and
summer and they will be linked all down
below so you can go check them out for
this first necklace I'm literally
obsessed with its like white and silver
and just like crystal a statement
necklace I actually wore it the other
day so I'm really since with that one
and then this one I haven't worn yet but
I'm super excited to wear it for the
spring
still has a little tag on it this is
happiness boutiques but I literally
think this one is so cute for the spring
just all these like pretty pastel colors
and there's like some royal blue in
there I know in haul videos in the past
I talked a lot about loon cat so you
guys aren't literally obsessed with
their scarves let's calculate how does
it say literally in this video actually
got this cashmere scarf and it's just
this light gray cashmere scarf and I
know you must be thinking like Roisin
why are you getting a scarf for names
like almost May but I actually wanted to
get a cashmere scarf because it's so
kind of chilly in the mornings it's like
one out of this six of the cashmere
scarves and they sell and it's like 100%
cashmere check that out it's linked down
below and I know if you use the code
that Gretchen loves beauty 20 off it'll
give you 20% off of their website so
that's really cool and then I'll just
show you everything I got from brandy
melville view as we all know I'm
obsessed with brandy melville and I had
to order some stuff from there for the
spring I actually got a lot so surprise
surprise I got more voting shorts I have
them in literally every color I'm not
kidding but the first ones I got are
just these dark grey ones and if you
don't know these are the most
comfortable shorts ever they're so soft
and stretchy and comfortable and I also
got them in light blue because I just
think they're really cute and I didn't
have the light blue ones I got this
shirt which I didn't even know is this
material and I bought it but it's
actually this really thick like ribbed
like sweatery material it's just kind of
a like I went to say crops more like a
mid-length like it's not long but it's
not cropped a t-shirt but it's like
tight and maroon and I think it's so
adorable it's just like a basic t-shirt
and it looks really good alright and
this I'm so bad for buying I have so
many white shirts I used to always find
myself morning when tops so I always buy
that probably most of my wardrobe
consists of white tops but I got another
one a long sleeve shirt and I'm pretty
charity of three of these but this one
looked really comfortable and so I
wanted another white long-sleeve shirt
and it actually is really comfortable
and stretchy they like the best basic
tops ever so if you're looking for like
basics go to brandy Melville and they're
pretty inexpensive to you so that is
cool and they sure I'm so excited about
I saw it on their website and I was like
I have to have it it's really wrinkly it
came all wrinkly in the package
is really cool design on the back with
like the strings and I love it because
it's like crap so it'll look really good
with skirts and shorts and such and it
has this little Crossy detail on the
front as well and it's another white top
surprise surprise I love it and this
last thing I'm kind of upset about
because I actually ordered it and like
the tank top form but it's just this
black bra let that has like crossies on
the front and i've seen this like all of
our branding levels instagram and such
but yeah i actually ordered the long
really tank top version of it it's
supposed to go to like there and this
one is obviously onna cabral at but i
mean it's okay i can make it work I'll
just wear under other like tank tops B I
actually did order the long one they
just messed up and sent me the brother
silly brandy melville so I'll show you
what I got from American Eagle and I
actually only got one thing it's this
blue sweatshirt II thing and the reason
I got it is because Lucy has it in red
and it's like the most comfortable
switcher thing ever and believe it or
not this is an extra small and like look
at how massive it is like a Coast - not
kidding like my knees it's so big but
it's like super comfy that way and baggy
and it's like really washed out looking
and I couldn't resist
I love comfortable clothing speaking of
blue sweatshirt I'll show you the only
thing I got from Nike which is actually
another blue sweatshirt lol it's
different than that one because this
one's more like medium like bright blue
and the reason I wanted it so bad is
because I've been obsessed with those
sweatshirts you know that have with the
cowl neck hoods like this like don't
really the hoodie but it just kind of
like punches right there and I was like
searching online for them and I like
order this one like all by itself so it
came the other day and I'm super happy I
love it and it's just really cozy it's
kind of on the more expensive side but I
know it's good quality because it's Nike
and it will like last a while I'm just a
four and I've actually been wanting to
try like a new foundation because a lot
of times I'll just wear like concealer
and powder on my face and my skin isn't
too bad or if you guys have watched
foundation routine or seen me do my
foundation honestly for probably the
last a year or two I really just been
using the covergirl like three in one
foundation which I still love that is
like my favorite decided I would try
these new Bobby Brown skips back on like
this I actually wanted to get two
because I wanted one that like matched
my skin tone and then one that I could
use for like contouring you know to like
blend it out is kind of like a cream
bronzer so I got one in natural tan and
I also got one in the shade golden
because natural tan is like my skin
color and then golden is like my contour
color and it just looks like this when
you open it this is the one that's my
skin color and I'll just like put this
all like along my face like there in the
middle and then with golden like see how
darker it is I'll usually just put it
like in the three where I would normally
contour thumbs up this video if you guys
want a new foundation routine with these
Bobby Brown sticks because I have been a
fan so far alright then from forever 21
everything I got I am very very happy I
got like I love so much and the first
thing I got is just this black skirt
it's really comfortable and flowy and
the reason I love it is because it has
all these buttons down the front so I
think it's super cute and different than
any other normal black circle skirt then
I got these shorts they're just like
lounging shorts but I couldn't not buy
them because they're so comfortable I'm
definitely gonna wear these to sleep
like every single night you know maybe I
live where I'm to school who knows then
I got this dress that I'm so excited for
because it's like a unique printed dress
like I don't have anything like this and
it has this lighter blue print right
there and then it's like maybe with
these other white designs all over it
and I really like the fit of it it's
kind of like loose and flowy in the back
I really really like it's like open with
just a little stripe of lighter blue and
print in the middle and yeah this dress
is just so adorable and I'm so excited
to wear it in the spring and summer then
I just got this plain black tank top and
I love buying basic tops because you can
like dress on operators and down so yeah
this is just like another basic black
tank top but I really like the fit of
this one because it's nice and tight on
the top and then it just flows out at
the bottom and there's those really
skinny straps then the last thing I got
from
21 I'm so excited it's this black
bathing suit top and I am obsessed with
the back of it it's like this netted
detailed design and it's just so
adorable
I'm not kidding when I was at purgatory
on it was calling my name it's so cute
so I actually just got these white
commerce and Lucy already has these and
I've just been obsessed with Hertz for a
while because whenever she wears them
they're really cute so I just got these
plain white ones and the last things I
have to show you are from Africa me and
honestly I will never get sick of going
to Abercrombie the first thing is just
this green pair of pants and they're
like loose joggers and they like grab at
the bottom right there and they grab at
the top too and they just tie in a
little bow at the top and I just think
they're so adorable and I wanted a pair
of like green flowy joggers like this
and they smell really good because
they're from a tur economy and I think
they look perfect with the very last
thing I have to show you in this haul
video which are just these leather
sandals that I got from Abercrombie
finished these dark brown leather
sandals and they're gonna look so good
with those green jogger pants and other
dresses and shorts and such in the
summer guys actually fried to show you
these silver bangle that my cousins got
me as an elite birthday present and it's
just so cute it's from Kate Spade and
it's just this plain silver bangle that
has like jewels all down the middle of
it it's totally me because I wear silver
jewelry all the time if you guys liked
