haul video for you guys and I have
clothes from Urban Outfitters for loving
lemons Windsor store like all these
different places I've just been like
really into shopping recently like when
am I not into shopping but I'm just
really excited to show you everything
that I got some stuff is for like
specific occasions like Pippi con I'm
going to be the con this is kind of
going to be all over the place because
all the first stuff I'm showing you is
it from one brand or store it's from an
app that I used to purchase all the
stuff from and I'll just tell you right
now this isn't even sponsored by doe or
anything like that but I know I talked
about it in a summer haul like a couple
of weeks ago I'll have that link down
below because I talked about dope like
more in detail though basically it's
just a shopping app that has like all
the stores that I love and that you guys
like to drop it to probably like Urban
Outfitters for love and lemons
Victoria's Secret pink Bath and Body
Works and it's just so convenient to get
it on one spot like that's why I use it
and it's really cool too like I
mentioned before is you get free
shipping off your first order and if you
use my code Gretchen you get a $5 off
coupon so it's essentially a $5 gift
card to like any store you want and I'll
have do't linked down below so you can
go check it out if you're interested so
like I said all the first stuff I'm
going to be showing you is from there
and as if it wasn't confusing enough the
first dress I'm going to be showing you
is seriously beautiful guys I had my eye
on this for seriously so long it's
definitely like a splurge like
investment item like don't get mad at me
I've been wanting for a while I've been
saving my money and the reason I wanted
it so bad since I'm going to beautycon I
wanted a really nice dress to wear it
for it and the reason this is confusing
is because it's from the brand 411
lemons but it's sold at Urban Outfitters
so I ordered it from Urban Outfitters
even though it's 411 lemons but they do
actually sell for home for love and
lemons website on the dough app as well
okay are you with me it's just this
beautiful white dress I didn't even
realize when I bought it to that it's
like tan right there with crochet on top
but I just thought it was like playing
crochet but it's so nice because not
gonna lie like I don't wear a bra with
it like you don't have to it's not even
powdered or thick it's just like the
sense it's crochet and there's like
already like 10-meter right there you're
going to beauty kondal and you'll see me
wearing this whoo and I know I mentioned
in a blog recently that I'm obsessed
with Candace you know the Victoria's
Secret Angel are like love her and I
follow her on Instagram and
a picture in a maxi dress that is this
print and it was so beautiful and I
wanted it but it was sold out like
everywhere probably because she posted a
picture on Instagram in it but I found
it in a two piece little set which I was
kind of iffy about if I liked it at
first but now I realized I actually
think it's cute I like her on me and I
think I'm going to not wear it to
beautycon but I'll wear to a style haul
party when I'm there because if you guys
didn't know I'm with stylehaul the
network or this is from the brand called
gems pirate booty which I never heard of
until Candice his picture and looked at
all the tags and found that that was the
brand and this is just the top was like
I said I order this within the dough app
who's actually from this website called
revolve and I've never heard of that
before either but I guess it's just this
online website that has this brand and
you're probably Gretchen where's the
bottom two this two-piece set well that
got tricky I will show them in a bit I
couldn't actually get those from the
dough app because they were sold out at
the time I wanted to buy them from
revolve on the dough tap but I ended up
getting them later and I couldn't decide
if I wanted it in a two piece set or in
pain I'm literally ridiculous like a
long-sleeve dress so this is just a
long-sleeved dress that is also the
brand gents pirate booty but it has this
really pretty print I don't even know
how to describe it but you can see it
and it's just like a babydoll dress I
showed this in the blog and a lot of you
were saying that it was too short it was
kind of like unflattering which I agree
with so I don't even know if I'm gonna
keep it I might maybe a little bit to
Lucy she thought it was cute I don't
know we'll see what I do with this I
think this ended up being pure sold out
though but I'm gonna have all of the
clothes that I show her haul video
listed down below in the description box
it takes me so long to get all the links
to the clothes so definitely check it
out if you're interested because I put
them all down there and I know they have
it's not other websites so I'll just
find the link for so you guys can find
it and buy it if you want to and the
last thing I got within the dough
shopping app is from Urban Outfitters
and just as great t-shirt dress but I
just think it's so beautiful because it
ties in the knot in the middle it makes
it like unique is just kind of like a
different spin on like a basic item
alright so here are the shorts that go
with the top that I just showed and
these puppies I did track down except I
tried to order them within like the
dough app but from the revolve website
they're out of stock and I was like no
but there was like a spot where you
could put your email in and it
email you once it came back in stock so
I was like oh my gosh sure they'll do
that and they emailed me like the next
day I ordered it right away I swear I
got the last pair cuz it said like hurry
like one left in stock and I was like oh
like hurrying like trying to check out
so I did end up getting them like thank
God because it would stink to just have
the top or just the bottoms when I want
it as like a cheapy side you know and I
just checked before this when I was
getting all the links for these clothes
and I think they're still outed them
again but like I said you can just enter
your email and they can like notify you
if you like want the same two-piece side
of me because they emailed any day
laters so the most beginning like new
shipments of these all the time and all
these next few things I'm going to be
showing you our from Urban Outfitters I
just like crazy recently and the first
thing I just got is this cream tank top
I think it's so cute that it likes
inches right there and flows out and I
checked online it's on sale it's only
like 20 bucks now and those of you that
know me best know that when I like
something I have to get it in more than
one color so I got it and this like
blue-gray color and I decided I would
give it to Lucy because then she can
like have it and keep her in her closet
and like wear it more but I can also
like borrow too and obviously as you can
tell some of these things are on hangers
because I've been like wearing them
already look this is obviously a good
collective haul so then I just got this
long-sleeve Greg ribbed sure that laces
all the way up the front and if you guys
know I have this in cream already and I
just love to in was so obsessed that I
knew I knew that in a different color
and then I just got this beautiful way
to crochet crop tank top and the reason
I got this is because my friend Tasha
fiercely Tasha here on YouTube
she's coming to be to come with me she
has this tank top in maroon and I was
like okay I literally need it it's
beautiful and I love that it's like open
in the back and if you guys now I wore
it to the Montford intense concert and
then I grabbed two more things to show
you that Lucy actually got because I
just think they're really cute and I
want to show you so she just got this
gray ribbed kind of t-shirt dress but
it's like a little more form-fitting and
it flares out and then she got this
beautiful black long maxi dress it's
seriously so cute and has some crochet
detailing like on the top on the sides
right there and I figured I was on sale
to this thing I think is also $20 so
like I said it'll be listing down below
literally it's 20 bucks and all the
things from Urban Outfitters all of
those things I found links online so you
guys can find them but this I couldn't
so if you
find where this is on Urban Outfitters
website definitely like let me know but
I couldn't find it his last thing I just
got is this black tank top knit dress I
feel like I keep saying this but if you
guys know I have this in cream I'm not
pissing back one but one just like this
from Free People and I wear it a bunch
it's like so unique and just chic and I
just relate the way it looks it's funny
cuz it's like a sweater II like knit
material but it's a kitang top dress
super comfortable - I'm all about
comfort maybe this will help you it's
from the brand Native youth if you want
to know then I'm gonna show you some
jewelry that I got recently and I know I
haven't talked about this company before
they're just from this website called
happiness boutique I just have really
cute jewelry and so the first thing are
just these earrings that I'm actually
wearing right now and they're just these
beautiful kind of crystal II like Daisy
earrings and I just think they're so
cute if you guys know me you know it
takes a lot to take out my pearl
earrings so the fact that I'm wearing
these right now must means they're
pretty special and I just have these
mint green studs - with jewels around
the side and then I just have all these
gold layered necklaces they look so cute
together and in art send this stuff I
have to show you it's from Windsor store
and you guys know I'm obsessed with ones
restore I've talked about them a bunch
before - and the first thing I'm just
going to show you is this top I'm
actually wearing right now it's just
this beautiful white crochet top just
looks like this it's kind of like
scalloped along the bottom I just think
that makes it look really unique the
curl at the bagel shop complimented me
on it this morning and I got this a blue
and white striped top that's also very
like unique and different I actually
work yesterday it was really comfortable
I'm just cute and I just love how the
sleeves flare out like that at the
bottom it's just nice and off the
shoulder and then I got this great crop
top and like I said I just like basic
things I have like a little spin on them
you know because then you can wear it
with a bunch of stuff and it just Criss
crosses in the bottom like that I just
love the little cutouts you could even
wear it with this skirt the other day
and Instagram I saw a picture of a girl
on the popular page and she was wearing
a denim ripped skirt and I was like hey
I remember when those were in when I was
like in middle school but I feel like
nobody really wears them anymore and I
was like I'm gonna like help bring the
trend back or maybe is back in turn and
I just don't know I'm talking about I
just thought the picture is so cute and
she's wearing me with like a cute little
problem or like crop top or something
and I'm like I really want a ripped
denim skirt cuz I don't have any anymore
and I found this one on Windsor and it's
seriously so adorable it's like media
wash
all these rips love it then I just got
this white lace two-piece set that I
talked about in a vlog and I wore it
Tamara and Julia's high school
graduation and it's just white lace it
smells like my perfume still and
actually has all these sparkles on it
which I didn't know when I bought it at
first I was like I don't know how I feel
but you had it being so cute and I think
it just makes the evening that more fab
it has all these like scallops along the
bottom and the skirt is just as white
tight skirt with again scallops all on
the bottom side note though kind of
sprinkles glitter home for you but it's
kind of cool I like glittery arms and
glittery legs and I just got this black
lace bra I love how it has like the two
lines right there it just makes it look
so cool undershirts
and I wore this under a 3 people dress
in that same blog that I showed that
white two-piece set so you might have
seen this before but yeah I just love it
the very last thing I got from Windsor
is just this Sun hat which I'm so
excited about because I've been on the
lookout for the perfect beige like Sun
Hat like this and usually I'd find one
that's like the brims to shore or like
it's too small on my head I have a huge
ad or it's not the right color or you
know but this is seriously I'm so
excited that I got it because of you
guys so now I live near traffic horse
racing truck and I go like all the time
in July and August but I can't wait to
wear this there because people wear like
their big floppy hats and I'm just so
excited that I got it cuz I know I'm
going to get a lots of use out of it
they'll be styling and protected from
the Sun win-win oh wait I forgot I put
this out here this is just from American
Eagle I don't even remember if I showed
in a home video yet did I it's really
embarrassing if I did but I got it at
the outlets when I was in South Carolina
like a month ago I guess I put it in the
pile show you this all video it's just
floral lace is up I really like it
