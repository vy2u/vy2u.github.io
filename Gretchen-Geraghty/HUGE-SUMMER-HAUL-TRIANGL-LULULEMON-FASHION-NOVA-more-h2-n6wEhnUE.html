in my heart
being my Vietnam
hey everyone so today I am filming a
huge summer haul video I've just been
doing lots of shopping in the past
couple weeks and I went to New York City
and a lot of you were saying after you
saw my New York City vlog I'll have it
linked down below that you wanted to see
what I got in New York City so this is
what I got there and also I have some
triangle swimwear which I've been
wanting to buy for so long and I finally
just got a couple bathing suits so I'm
really excited to show you that and I
have stuff from like Oakley Lululemon
forever 21
Hollister packs on Mac and yeah so I'm
not too sure everything I got and let's
just get rid of everything so the first
thing I have to show you is this scarf
which I know you might think like
Gretchen this is our haul video what are
you talking about but I'm the kind of
person where I'm always cold I don't
know what it is like it's literally 70
something degrees out right now and I
have this huge sweater that I wore to
school today and I'm wearing leggings so
I actually do our scarves in this summer
especially like for dinner time I'll
wear just like light scarves like these
and this one I think is like so
versatile it's in the color mocha
it's from the website called moon cats
and I showed like a lot of their stars
before because I always get their
scarves because I love that they just
have the best cars ever and this is just
the 100% cashmere mocha scarf and I wish
you could feel this through this YouTube
video right now because it is so soft
and you can use the code Gretchen 20 off
and that will get you 20% off your order
so that's awesome so that will be linked
all down below then I'll show you when
I'm most excited for which is my
triangle bathing suits because like I
said I've literally wanted them for so
long and all the ones I got came with
these little try bags I think all their
bathing suits do they're just like these
drawstring bags that they came in you
know what you could probably even use
these like you could keep using them for
other stuff if you want to I don't even
think about that but they're probably
like reusable little like drawstring
bags so that's cool and the first one I
got is just this pink one I got classic
ones I don't know the name of them but I
will have them linked all down below so
you can see exactly which ones I got the
first one I got is just this pink
triangle one and this one's just like
the light pink and they're made out of
like neoprene so they're different than
other bathing suits they're really thick
and like good material and my cousin had
one when we were in the Bahamas she had
like a turquoise one and so I knew I
wanted them ever since then and just for
reference I got a small in the top and
the bottom
I really don't have a chest so a small
is good for me I probably could have
even gotten an extra small and a small
and deep bottom and then the same style
is the pink one is this blue one which I
knew I wanted because it's royal blue
and I just think royal blue looks so
good especially like with blond hair I
don't know I just think royal blue looks
really good the same style is that one
but just royal blue and these are what
the tags look like they're just these
black like triangle
it's tags and the last one I got is this
one and this one honestly is my favorite
I didn't think it would be at all but it
really has become my favorite I actually
wear this to a pool party and it was
really nice this one is different it
kind of has like this black mesh across
like a white background that's what the
top looks like and the bottom is just as
hot neon coral like orange color and
it's like so so pretty I'm like it makes
you look really tan and also I want to
say look this isn't sponsored by
triangle or anything I just bought those
with my own money and they're pretty
pricy like gotta say especially living
in the US and you have to pay for
shipping and they're already expensive
as it is but I knew I wanted them for
awhile I always would see pictures like
all over Instagram of like triangle
bathing suits and I'm like I have to
have them this job has a buckle like
this and these ones have these ties and
but yeah they're just like really good
quality and then I got some clothes from
this online website called fashion Nova
I'll have all the links down below of
all the clothes that I got and they just
have really cute stuff like they have
some stuff that you could wear like
concerts and they have a lot of good
like summer clothes and this house
really excited for it because I don't
have any body suits but this is just a
black bodysuit and it dips really low in
the back and I've always wanted a
bodysuit just because they're really
really snug and they look really good
under like high-waisted shorts and
skirts and this is just a black like
ribbed one it has a little like ribs in
it now I just got this white long-sleeve
dress and it's just flowy and really
like bohemian looking to me and it has
lace on the sleeves right there and it
has like flowy sleeves there's like a
little cutout in the back and it ties
it's by the brands double zero I guess
they have like different brands on
fashion Nova it's all from fashion Nova
but it's like different brands on their
website but this first black tank top is
from the brand rehab these last few
things I'm so excited for there's this
shirt which is just like tribal prints
but my favorite is like the cut of this
obviously because
so different it's like off the shoulders
it just goes across like this and then
it's like long sleeves that are like
flowy and then they grab at the bottom
and it's just really like bohemian
looking this and that other white dress
or both really like boho looking they go
with these white shorts that I also got
from fashion OVA they're just these
white ripped high-waisted shorts that
look like this and I like these because
they're super high waisted and I'm
really tall I'm 5 AI actually I've
measured the other day I went over to
the doctor's I was 5 8 and a half so I'm
like 5 8 5 and 1/2 and whatever
somewhere in there basically a lot of
high-waisted shorts don't go high up
enough on me because I have such a long
torso so they only go like halfway up to
my belly button in there like that I
said enough but these are totally
high-waisted enough which is like really
good for me and like I said they just
have lots of rips and distressing down
the front I wanted white high-waisted
shorts for a while and this is by the
brand signature 8 just for reference and
I forgot to mention for 15% off of
fashion ovas website use the code EXO
Gigi then we're gonna move on to
Lululemon because you guys know I'm
obsessed with the lemon like the
obsession with Lululemon is unreal so
much stuff I got while I was in New York
City some of the stuff I actually
ordered online after I went to New York
City because I want it so bad and some
of the stuff I got when I went to
regatta recently I found a little lemon
nearby and I was like I got it go so I
got a lot of stuff from Lululemon
so the first thing I got actually forgot
that I got it and I didn't even wear yet
but it's just this white long-sleeved
jacket and I honestly wanted this for so
long like I always saw it online and I
just wanted it and it's really good for
like working out and even if you don't
want to work out you can just wear this
like around the house or you can wear at
school or whatever it's just a really
good check it to throw over anything and
I got 4 different sports bras because
I'm obsessed with their sports bras the
first two I got are actually the same
style the different colors because I
just could not decide between these two
colors so this is what the coral one
looks like and then it crosses in the
back like that and I literally just I'm
obsessed with the way the back close
with all the crosses and I think it's so
cute and then it has a little Lululemon
sign right there and this one's in a
size nice size too but then this one's
in a size 4 so I don't really know and
this one I think is such a pretty color
too it's more of like a medium
washed out looking ping again Criss
crossing the back with the Little Lulu I
mean circle right there one day a girl
at my school is like Christians you look
at sticker on your pants and I was like
what are you talking about
and it was really just these right here
I was like no it's just a little I mean
little circles and these are called the
free to be wild bras in case you're
wondering and I usually just get a two
or a four because if you flap like me
you can get a two or a four I really
like the free to be wild ones because
they have all the cool like crosses in
the back like such then I got two green
ones this one I literally wanted for so
long and I like saw on their website too
and it's just like lime green and this
one just has like one big cross in the
back it has like to it thick straps and
I really like the way it looks and this
one is mint green and I just love it for
the color I think it's so adorable I
love love love like compliment green
then he just has like thin straps like
that in the back which form a little why
it has like mesh right there in the back
so that's cool too then I just got this
headband because they have really good
headbands with really cute colors and
this one's just like a periwinkle color
I would call it and I have little
grippers on the inside to grab on to
your hair so it doesn't slip off and
then the last thing I got is so near and
dear to my heart I'm so excited you guys
saw in my summer morning routine video
if you didn't see that I will also have
that link down below these are just the
royal blue em to the streets that's what
they're called I looked it up leggings
from Lululemon and I've gone in that
brew so long cuz I sell them on their
website and I was like who doesn't need
a pair of royal blue leggings am i right
so they're just these really thick nice
ones that was like I had these in darks
purpley maroon color and I love them
because they're like really sick like
good material oh my gosh then I have to
show you I went to the mall yesterday
just so that I could get these and if
you guys don't remember I just had these
black Oakley's before before I just has
these black lenses on them and I just
thought I want to get a new pair of
lenses just to like shake it up so I got
these purple ones which are so awesome
when I went to this store
the girls like showing all the different
lenses I
get to put in them and shoes if we just
got this new color called sapphire and
they're like this blue purple color and
I'm so obsessed with them like they just
literally look so fresh so yeah that's
awesome
and they're polarized so they'll like
protect my eyes while I'm rowing on the
water and I just literally love them is
while I was there I saw this other pair
that I really wanted and so I had to get
them to buy just these white ones with
like red rubber grippy sides and they've
really cool lenses they're like
yellowish reddish orangish and these are
also really fresh and they're Boston
University colors which is so cool
because I will be attending at Boston
University in the fall and then the
other day I caved in I know that I saw
my tweet but I tweeted that since I took
like all ip's this year like senior year
after ApS has been so boring look I
literally just have nothing to do at
school because all our teachers give us
preps because we don't have any material
to cover anymore
so I've been so bored at school if I
literally do nothing so it's been really
bad I started like online shopping
during my classes and I was scrolling
through free people because their stuff
is like perfect I don't know if you guys
remember but I have this tan long-sleeve
Henle from there and it has sleeves like
this but they're red and I'm like
obsessed with it and I actually didn't
give away with it so I saw this black
one and I was like I know I already have
it in a different color but I still
really want it it's just a long-sleeve
black Henley and it has these little
cuffs because I think the cuffs are just
so cute and like so unique like no other
stores really have clothes that look
like this so I really haven't shopped at
Hollister and forever but then yesterday
when I was at the mall to get my
oakley's I walked by Hollister and I was
like whoa because at our mall Lucy and I
were so surprised they like redid the
whole front of Hollister it's all like
glass looking it was so cool so we're
like we have to go in and then I saw
these white high-waisted shorts with
ribs and like I said I wanted wait how
you see charged with drips for a while
and I kind of forgot that I got the
other ones from
fashion Nova so I bought these and I
thought they were so so cute but then I
just tried them on before this haul
video over the first time and they're
way too big as you can see like they're
like falling off of me and kind of baggy
and like not cute looking so actually
think I might have to return those and
that's okay because I have the other
white ones from fashion OVA but I did
buy those yesterday oh wow it looks like
everything I have left to show you is
actually from the city which I got
before I got like everything else I
probably shoulda showed you first this
is a funny story when I was in New York
City I had to pee so bad and I was in
Topshop and I was like do you have a
bathroom and they were like no but like
across the street if you go into this
Asian market they have a bathroom in the
basement and I was like okay like I'm
gonna go so I went into this Asian
market it had to go in this sketchy
little bathroom but on my way I saw this
little NIT bag and I thought it was so
cute so I had to buy it and honestly I
will make him use of this I know I will
I will probably put like my towel in it
and like food and stuff and bring it to
the pool and I'm lifeguarding so this
little baby will come in handy I'm
pretty sure it was like four dollars so
can't beat that then from any Melville
on my way out I grabbed a bunch of these
little stickers of losing some stickers
there's California there's Donuts
there's gnarly this like Broadway wine
first thing I got it's just this gray
long-sleeve beat and it's so cozy and
soft and comfy and warm and it's just
long-sleeve like this and I have little
draw strings right there and it's like a
zip up and it has a hood like so and I'm
happy I got that because I don't have
another zip up Hoodie like that just for
like being casual and lazy and when you
want to look homeless at school like me
and I got two more things from brandy
melville this one I'm really excited for
cuz I don't have a tank top that is like
this color and it's just they're really
soft stretchy material that I love it
every little cells and it's like a tank
top with thin little spaghetti straps
like that I would say it's between like
cropped and normal length it's just
really pretty like dark red color and
then this there is no excuse I'm
obsessed with white tops and I always
buy them I'm bad I got another white top
this one is also kind of in between the
cropped in normal length I would say
like little ribs on its
like ribbed material if you know what
I'm saying it's like a little scoop neck
so I thought it was so cute
and I don't have a shirt that's white
and tight and I'll button down the front
so I justified it for myself and this I
actually got yesterday at the mall - I
got it from PacSun my pack son at my
mall sells some stuff from brandy
melville and I walked in and I saw this
it's just like their white tank top with
the little crisscross he's right there
and if you guys know I have it in black
to actually work to New York City and I
just really like the detail of it so I
had to get it in white from forever 21 I
saw these blue shorts I've been like
obsessed with the world blue lately so I
really wanted to get these and right as
I saw them and they're just high waisted
and distressed and these little puppies
were like a shot in the dark because I
had no idea what size i was because
forever21 does sizing like 24 25 26 27
like that instead of double 0 0 to 4 so
I just had to kind of guess and they fit
me perfect so that's good this shirt was
just staring into my soul I think it's
so cute it's like navy blue but it's
like light blue at the top and I have
little stripes on the sleeve and I just
think it's really really cute and I just
couldn't not buy it and then it looks
like the very last thing I have to show
you is just for Mac there's one little
eyeliner because I want it for a while
it's just their eye Kohl in smolder it
just looks like this and I just wanted
it for when I tight line my eyes because
it's like this really black eyeliner for
these like jingling the whole time I'm
so sorry if they were it's like I'm
really hyper today and I feel like this
whole video is way too long I'm really
sorry if you just had through all of my
blabbering through this entire whole
video comment your favorite comment your
