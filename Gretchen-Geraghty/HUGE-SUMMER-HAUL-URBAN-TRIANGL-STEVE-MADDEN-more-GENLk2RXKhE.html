another summer haul video and I'm so so
excited because I've been saving this
stuff for a while to show you guys
because I wanted to wait till it was a
lot of things that I could show you
because I knew I had stuff like coming
in the mail and stuff that I would be
buying so it's been like a full month of
just like collected things that I have
saved up to show you and I'm really
excited to show you everything that I
have so let's just get right into it so
the first thing I want to share with you
is actually this app called snupps and
it's really really cool because you can
organize the stuff that you already have
in your closet like you take pictures of
stuff that you have and you can upload
it onto your snupps profile so this is
mine and it's so easy to like organize
all your stuff so you like take pictures
and you like I have two different shelf
so like one is shoes in one is fashion
and I'm I choose one I just have like
different pairs of shoes so that I don't
accidentally like buy the same ones and
like fashion I have just a bunch of
different like maybe bathing suits and
like outfits and stuff and like also
sometimes if I'm trying to plan out an
outfit event or like what I'm
gonna wear the next day I'll just look
on here I'm like just the different
stuff that I have uploaded and that's
like pictures you're uploading it's
almost like a mix between Instagram and
Pinterest but it's like photos of your
stuff that you're uploading and it's
also free to download so that's really
cool and like I use it for the beauty
and like fashion and stuff which I know
a lot of people do you can also use it
for like other things if you want to
keep track of them and you can just like
upload photos on your like I think it's
a really good idea so you don't like
lose track of your stuff and you guys
should totally make one and follow me on
here my username is just Gretchen loves
beauty because I'm Gretchen loves beauty
you can see the stuff I have uploaded
and it'll be a great time so I'll have
this linked all down below so you can go
download it and check out snupps so then
the first thing I got is actually
perfume and it came in this handy dandy
little travel case I would say it's pink
and you just like roll it up like this
and then it comes out usually push it
down um but this is actually the Michael
by Michael Kors scent and this is from
scent bird it's just this website and it
has all these like designer perfumes and
it's actually a monthly subscription
service for perfume and I believe it's
like $15 no it's 14
five I want to say exactly per month but
they send you a new one of these puppies
every month this is like a special
edition penguin and I know I've actually
posted about set bird on Instagram
before I have a black one too which is
like people ahjussi so like obviously
fave ones from Juicy Couture and like
Michael Kors so they have like all these
designer ones and I actually know they
have over 350 different designers so
there's like so much sludge and for you
guys to choose from and I think it's
just a really cool idea to change up
your scent once in a while have that
link down below - and I think it's a
great idea
and you can just throw it in your bag
and it's like super super convenient and
before the juicy has been a favorite for
like a really long time but this one
Michael by Michael Kors is like a new
favorite like guys if you haven't
smelled this go out and smell it at
least like it seriously I don't know it
just smells so good
into the coat gob 25 you will get 25%
off your first month subscription to
Sanford ok I literally have so much to
show you first I guess I'll just show
you my triangle swimsuits in my last
haul video I showed three different ones
that I got and I actually bought two
more because I'm seriously obsessed and
I just love them so much and I'm like
the day I posted that haul video we're
like the day after I posted a picture of
these swimsuits so you might have seen
them on my Instagram if you don't know
my interims at Coachella speedy go ahead
and follow me South plays promo whatever
seriously love these are like the same
style and I got this blue one with white
highlighter yellow yeah that's yellow
and the bottoms look like this they're
like blue with white on the sides and
then the top just looks like this
actually you should recognize or this my
summer lookbook and someone commented
and said like that style is not for you
because you don't have any boobs and
they're not big enough to fill it out
but guys I got an extra small on the top
if you're in case you're wondering like
I try my best okay I literally got like
a smaller size they have because I have
no chest
so whatever the bottom is I just get a
small and the top again extra small
because I don't have any boobs so
anyways the next one is this pink and
yellow and white one this one's actually
like perforated the other ones just like
normal neoprene I just love the colors
of this one like it seriously so cute
well the bottoms are actually cool
or pink on the inside like that but then
they're just yellow on the front and
white perforated on the sides nicely I'm
just like obsessed with triangles emcees
I feel like someone's head on my last
haul video - like why is everyone so
obsessed with those and honestly I just
like to see them on my Instagram feed
and stuff and I just think they're so
pretty like the colors they have like
those are such bright colors and I just
think they're so pretty for the
summertime and also I feel like some of
you said today extend those to you or
whatever like no I bought all five with
my own money I know they're really
expensive but I just think they're so
cute and I really wanted to invest in
them good quality so yeah they don't
sponsor me or send me anything anyway
okay I'll show you these bracelets I'm
wearing this blue one is clearly a lokai
bracelet and I actually have gone
through two different of the clear lokai
ones the first one I cut open to see if
there's stuff inside and it's true there
really is there was like mud in the
black one and water and the white one so
that's really cool and then a second one
I had actually I took it off and I would
stretch it all the time and play with it
so I broke a sad piece but so I really
wanted this blue one for the longest
time and I always told Justin so he got
me this blue one and I love it it's a
special edition blue one and there's a
white feed there and a black beat there
and those of you that don't know about
loci it supposed to be like I don't know
it's like balance or something from like
the top of the world and the bottom like
this is from snow for Mount Everest and
there's like mud from the Dead Sea in
there I think correct me if I'm wrong
it's something like that and this little
bracelet is an elven bracelet and it's
new Lucina I actually just got our
wisdom teeth out last week and we both
got really really sick from it
so Justin savant asked these little
elephant bracelets because she knows we
love elephants
and I'm obsessed I think it's so cool oh
my gosh
and by the way see this one that is I've
shown it so many times it's from
Nordstrom Tristan got it for me like
forever ago
but um I actually lost it recently and I
was like so so upset and I found it
today it was my pool bag because I like
took it off tanning I think and I'm so
happy I found it so yeah just had to
mention that I'm really happy oh and
then I'll show you these bracelets
they're literally so cute they're from
this place called pura vida and that
like literally struck home for me
because me and my
Hannah we went on a Costa Rican like
exchange trip at my school and we stayed
with a Costa Rican family and we'd
always say peer reviewed it to each
other like if any of you live in Costa
Rica or like familiar with it it's like
a thing they have there like they would
say pho which is like Pure Life and it's
just like a saying they have in Costa
Rica so this bracelet company is called
pure Vida and it's so cool like I love
the idea behind pura vida because they
like donate money to like charity
honestly it's just awesome I love it
feels like link down below you can
totally read about their company and all
the good things that it does so I guess
I'll just show you the bracelets I got
so these are all the different ones I
got and this one is definitely my
favorite it's like mint green and it has
these silver like bars and it's just
like so so cute I like to wear em all
stacked together like this then this
one's just a black one with like silver
circle beads right there and this one's
so cool it has like grey and blue and
white it's just like pieces of like
string it's example and then this one's
like bright blue like braided with white
and I think it's so cute I just think
they look all so cute together
like I literally love them they're so
adorable and this one I feel like I
remember it don't eat it - like dolphins
or like a dolphin charity or something
and I thought it was like awesome so
yeah I love these puppies and like I
said four of them went all down below so
you can check the exact ones that I got
if you are interested I'd like this all
videos gonna be so long I seriously
apologize in advance I just have a lot
to show you and I get really excited I'd
like to talk about everything like a
million hours so we're so sure you start
from this online boutique called Long
Island fashion and I believe they're
from Australia they literally have the
cutest clothes ever I am not kidding you
I'm gonna order like everything from
their website like so adorable first I
got this sweater it's white and it has
just like black stripy detail like that
and it's honestly just so cute and
comfortable and I really like the deep
well V right there and I got this white
crop top from there and it's kind of
hard to tell as I'm holding it up but
now you can see yeah it just has like
the cage detail at the bottom it's like
really cute with high-waisted shorts and
I actually also showed this in my summer
like fashion lookbook video so you
probably recognize it from there
but it's literally so durable I also
posted about on my Instagram
basically I'm just obsessed with this
top
you can tell okay and this romper is so
cute like I literally love it it's white
and it just has like lace right there
like it flows out and also along the
bottom and it like cinches up at the top
but I actually let my friend borrow it
before I showed it in this video and she
washed it and she shrunk it so as you
can tell as I'm trying it on it's like
way too small on me now but luckily I'm
just gonna get a new one so that's okay
it's so basic like you can wear it with
anything you can just like throw it on
instant cute outfit and then from all
and I just got this black long-sleeve
shirt and I love the details on it it
like laces up in the front and ties and
there's some tassels and like lace on
the front too and then right here see
there's all those little like lisi
details on the sleeves and it like grabs
at the end and at the bottom too and
then the last year from holland is just
this black and white short sleeve
striped shirt and I think this is so
cute and I love the detail on the back
how it just kind of twist like that so
it's more like open back then I'll show
you I got two sports bras it from value

cute and so unique it's like this blue
tie dye and in the back is so adorable

wear these puppies I'm literally over
six feet tall but it's okay I wore these

they're so basic because I knew I'd be
able to wear them for a long time after
graduation I'll be able to wear them

so excited when I got it cuz I wanted it
for a while and some of you left me in
comments like you're spoiled or like
something mean like that but literally
guys like all this stuff I bought the
only thing I got was this it's because I
graduated high school like pretty sure
I'm allowed to get like one present for
graduating high school so anyways I pay
for my clothes and my shoes and the
stuff that I buy and like all my
triangle bathing suits but they did get
me a present for graduation so I want to
share it with you it just also everyone
and it has these little like crystals
around the side I finally am able to
wear it now because I finally got it
fitted so yeah look this I want to see
the type of it is called Blair in case
you're wondering I think that's the like
style name and then I wanted to show you
these necklaces Justin got me for
graduation okay so it's like two silver
ones I don't have you guys have noticed
but I like silver jewelry the best
silver watch for necklaces but so
there's just two of them one of them has
just a G little charm and then the other
one has two little charms and I actually
took a picture of all three of them so
here it is you can see all three of them
together and I will just usually wear
both necklaces together and Z says G and
then the heart says all this stuff like
love and a so it's like Gretchen loves
and then beauty so it's like good luck
CD cuz I'm GLB so I just love them and I
think they're like so cute all together
because they just like laid next to each
other and they're all like dangly and
yeah I just love these necklaces and I
thought it was so sweet says GOP that's
me guys
oh now to show you these because these
were the only thing that I got from
American Eagle but I just got these like
washed shorts that have some rips and
then I love them because they have like
lace pockets right there that poked out
the front that's literally the only
reason I'm on them is good yeah cool
little pockets at hang out the front and
then the back just looks like that as
normal
like it is little saline hi thumbs up if
you remember the puzzle tag it's a
member of my hair was really short and
I'm here ugly your hair

so then I'll show you guys what I got
from Lulu Lemon I'll go through the rest
of this they're waiting for me to go to
Chipotle we're starving but this little
sweatshirt I got is removable lemon and
I so cute and comfortable it's just like
a hoodie and then it's like dark gray on
the bottom right there and on sleeves I
don't just love this I think it's
adorable Ike you're an accent at the end
of that I just have four more things to
show I got this purple tank top and this
is like my favorite fit of tank top that
they have I don't know it's like tight
but it's kind of like this breathing
breathable material yep just like that
in the back and then I got this aqua
blue mint green t-shirt I really fit
fitted this too I have this in red and
it's stretchy and just comfortable
I love it then I got this sports bra
which I already have in pink and coral
but I really wanted the all-black one
and it just has all those crosses in the
back like that so it's like so cute on
and if you can see it like underneath a
tank top it's like so adorable and then
I got these grey leggings because I
actually went a little lemon with Justin
and he picked out that purple tank-top I
just showed in these gray leggings he
really wanted me to get them and I don't
really know how I feel about grey
leggings like I don't know how much they
match and whatever anyways he wanted me
to get these light grey leggings so I
got these like a leggings and I think
they're just like wonder unders like the
black ones I have but they're gray so
they're cool I wore them taught you good
this morning actually and yeah don't
I'll show you everything I have from
Urban Outfitters I got so much stuff
from there and actually just came in the
mail like yesterday and today like five
minutes before I film this video this
shirt came so this is just a gray like
plain looking t-shirt but it's special
because there's like a little peplum at
the bottom I thought I was so cute
because I need more like basic stuff
that I can just wear everywhere a lot if
I'm Andy and I then I got this sweater
whoo this long-sleeve gray sweater that
has lace at the bottom like that so
again it's like a basic kind
top but it has lace at the bottom so it
makes it different and I just think this
is so Cuban this is actually a white
dress I got from Urban Outfitters and
this is a dress that I wore to my high
school graduation and it just has a
really deep like V there and there's
like some cutouts on the side and I like
the back to how it's just like the two
little thin straps I can keep wearing
this and like years to come as well I
got a lot of good like basic things that
I can like bring to college with me then
from Urban I actually have seen this for
a while knew that I had wanted it and
it's just this long sleeve top it's like
a sweater at the top but then it's more
like flowy like light like t-shirt
material at the bottom and I like the
contrast to textures and I think it was
really different I just love this light
blue color and then these two things I
got from Urban Outfitters I'm seriously
obsessed with I saw this blue romper on
the website I was just poking around and
I don't know what it is but like me and
blue recently I'm just obsessed with
anything blue and especially like royal
blue like this royal blue color I don't
know what it is I'm just like absolutely
obsessed so he's got this royal blue
romper and it's so cute on to like it
looks so good and then the back details
out like crisscross it's like that I
just think it's so so cute and all wear
this like all summer long
then this dress also I've actually seen
on their website for a really long time
I just always thought it was like show
so adorable cuz I love like the polka
dotted kind of print on it it's just
black with like cream white polka dots
but the back is the reason I love it so
much there's kind of like cutouts on the
side and then the back just has all
these like crisscross like straps again
and I just think it's so so cute like I
already know I want to wear this on the
opening day of the track this year and
this little guy actually lists he
ordered off from Urban Outfitters too
and she got me this royal blue elephant
candle because she knows that I love
elephants and I definitely like bringing
this to college with me I think it's so
cute I don't even know if I'll light it
maybe I'll just leave it there was like
a decoration because also she knows I
don't know what it is I just everything
we're all blue recently I'm like I want
it I saw this royal blue Jeep driving
around the other day and I took a
picture of it because I'm out
so cute so yeah basically I love this
guy oh my gosh
can we name him right now what can his
name be Hank Hank to the elephant
Oh Hank you're so cute do you want to
know I thought about that actually
because I'm watching Royal Pains on
Netflix right now and his name's Hank so
Hank oh good god dude then I'll show you
these t-shirts I got from enjoy
essential it's just like this online
store that has these cool like graphic
printed shirts so I got this one that
says I woke up like this I love it cuz
they're versatile like you could use
this as like a lamb tree look I could
like sleeping this but I also could like
dress it up with like high-waisted
shorts and like a sweater and wear now
is what I just thought was so cute it
says on Wednesdays we wear pink because
if you guys know Mean Girls you
obviously know this shirt and I just
thought it was really cute and I really
liked it okay these are like one of my
favorite things that I got and I can't
believe it's the last thing that I'm
showing you but I finally arrived at the
end of my haul video so these are just
new to sandals that have little crystal
gems all down the front right here
they're from Nordstrom and they're so
cute they're Christine cava Lori in case
you're wondering and honestly I just
wanted these from Nordstrom I've been
eyeing them for such a long time because
wait let me just show you I have nude
sandals with like circle gems on the
front but like all the circles fell out
wait I'm gonna be right back I gotta
show you okay I just grabbed these
puppies so these are the ones I was
talking out I've had these literally for
two or three years probably from
Nordstrom and I just love them but I
don't know if you can tell five out of
the ten little gems have fallen out like
I still wear them anyway and just
pretend like people can't tell and like
as you can tell they're kind of old and
beaten up and like dirty so I saw these
on there and these are like basically
the same except like square crystals so
I've had to get these and I thought
they're so cute and I just love them
also I feel like these are kind of
thicker as you can tell them these like
these are like better quality anyway so
I'm really happy I got these I'm gonna
put them on right now so we can go to
Chipotle yes thank you so much for a
i'll see you next video i decide to be
4head you don't</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
