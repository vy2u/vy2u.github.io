start off my videos like that hey
everyone so today I have a huge summer
haul for you guys and if you can tell
I've been sitting outside I'm actually
home for the summer I'm so so so happy
to be home for the summer like I could
not wait to get home and just be in the
warm weather and I'm just so happy I'm
in a great mood and I have been buying
so many clothes like it's literally an
addiction I just thought I would share
with you guys it's a bunch of stuff that
I got for the summertime and yeah what a
perfect day to film outside I was
actually gonna film on my back deck to
what the lighting was like kind of weird
and I thought this would be better so
I'm like in this like awkward shady spot
of my front lawn morning you right now I
have a lot to show so first I have stuff
to show you from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works and
Brandi Melo and I haven't bought stuff
from Bath and Body Works in a while but
they have this kind of lotion that is my
favorite ever so I went to the store and
leaving Tomatoes discontinued I was so
upset so basically I had to order online
and I got two of them in case I run out
I got dark kiss lotion if you guys have
never smelled this it literally smells
so good I don't even know how to
describe it but it used to be like my
favorite and I was missing it and then I
also got the Georgia Peach candle smells
like the best sweetest peaches ever and
then the stuff I got from brandy
melville is first I just got these a
pair of socks that are actually a
surprise present for my friend Taylor so
if you're watching this Taylor they say
something special on them but I'm not
gonna say it in case she watches this
video then I just got this Kayla tank
and Lucy my friend Hannah had this tank
top and I always loved it they were like
really soft and the fit of them are
really really cute really hope your
neighbors don't see me I always feel
awkward
I'm Jenna I just got this forest green
romper this is super cute it's like a
halter goes really low in the front then
I just got this white short-sleeved
t-shirt but it's different cuz it has a
bunch of holes in it just kind of like
this gray Holi shirt I'm wearing right
now then this year looks really cute
online I don't know how I feel about it
now that I've actually bought it this
leaves look kind of funny but like I
don't know it's still really cute it's
just as blue and white really thin
stripe kind of crop it's kind of like
loose-fitting you know and it bunches at
the top in the bottom and this top is so
cute Lucy as I Gretchen you have to get
it and it's just black and it has kind
of scallops at the top and it has just
all these pretty kind of details along
the front buttons up the front it's like
a short little cropped black bra laptop
I don't know
like this and then also from brandy I
don't really know why but all of these
like pictures came in my package like
little I counted 25 25 pictures and
they're all just like different pictures
you would see in brandy melville so I
actually think they're really cool
usually if you've been to a Bernie
Melville's store they have a bunch of
these like all over the walls so maybe
I'll make a cool little collage in my
room who knows and also a bunch of
stickers so Justin loves the brandy
bubble stickers Alex give them to him so
all of those pieces from brandy melville
in Bath and Body Works I actually got on
this app on my phone and it's called
dough and guys dough is literally I'm
not kidding like the coolest shopping
app ever because okay this is what it
looks like this blue one right there and
you open it up it has all these stores
like it literally has every store that
you probably shop at as all the stores
that I shop at and the reason it's so
cool like I was thinking like okay why
do I need to like use an app to buy
stuff online from these stores like I
can just go online and just order normal
but I know like your first order you get
free shipping and also I ordered stuff
from like Bath &amp;amp; Body Works brandy
Melville I was about to order this hat
off of Zara and you can like order it
all in one spot so it's like so
convenient rather than ordering it on
all these different places Bailey of
every store that you could shop at and
also what's really cool is you can like
save it if you want to go back to it
later that's what I did with like all my
brandy clothes and then I like wet and
checked out later and I have a little
code for you guys if you guys type in
Gretchen at checkout you'll get five
dollars off of your order which is so
nice so it's literally like a $5 coupon
to get like money off of clothes that
you want to get like anywhere and also
like I said on your first or you get
free shipping so that is like so sick so
I will have that link down below you
guys can go check it out it's a
literally like my new favorite shopping
app and I'm not even like saying that
like it's literally so sick like I love
it and the next thing I have to show you
is this swimsuit from triangle and also
undo I think they have yeah I know they
have triangle Ando too so lik like I
said they have so many clothes down
there but this I just got sent to me
from triangle thank you so so much
triangle for this bathing suit it's like
my new favorite I just love it
they've these new like cheeky type of
bottoms or not like too too cheeky but
just enough cheeky you know what I'm
saying
there are these hot pink neoprene
bottoms and then it's just this black
strapless OOP doesn't it then it just is
a black strapless top that zips up and I
really like this style of top I have it
in a couple different colors okay this
is really funny I don't even know where
I saw I think I saw on Instagram
I saw a picture of a girl wearing this
shirt and I said quinoa and kale and I
was like oh my god
that is me like I need that shirt so I
literally was searching on the internet
forever for somewhere to find this like
they used to sell it at Urban Outfitters
and it was sold out and like all these
places like used to sell it didn't
anymore like Nordstrom and I finally
found it there was one left in my size
on this website called dulls kill I
think I think it's called tall scale
which is an online website and I found
it and I was like yes so I ordered it
like right away and then I'm literally
such a sucker I saw that they had wild
Fox sweatshirts and I've wanted a wild
Fox watcher forever like literally I
remember when I first started YouTube
like in like ninth grade wild Fox
metrics were like all the rage like
they're baggy Beach jumpers that's like
the style it's called and it's like the
softest material ever like in so
stretchy so I was like okay I need one
so just got this long-sleeve dark gray
one and it says Hollywoodland I just
thought that was really cute and I also
got one for Lucy it just is dark green
one that has a mistletoe on the front I
think that graphic is so cute and I got
it for Lucy because I thought why not
I'm gonna try to have everything that I
mentioned in Sawle video link down below
so you guys can check it out if you're
interested because I know I did that my
last haul video I found all the stuff
that I got from Free People and I live
down below and you guys went this is so
helpful thank you so much so I'm gonna
try to do that on this one if I can find
all this stuff it kinda takes me a while
it's like search for everything but I'm
gonna do it for you guys and in the next
place I got stuff from is Windsor store
and Windsor stores like the cutest
clothes ever I know I've talked about
them in my haul videos before and the
first thing I got is just this gray
v-neck t-shirt that has all these little
rips on it that I am wearing currently
it's really cute
I even like tide it's kind of like
punchy and short then I just got these
white high-waisted shorts with a bunch
of rips down the front and I love
high-waisted shorts especially for the
summertime a cute little crop top I got
the same high-waisted shorts but in this
dark wash colors I have all the rips oh
my goodness gracious
look at all these strings Wow I might
have to cut some of that off that is
extreme these are very distressed
regardless I think they're so adorable
new people the other day I tried on this
denim dress I thought it was so cute
I'll insert a picture of it right here
try my said I'm dressed thought it was
so cute
however it was so so so short on me like
literally so short I was like Gretchen
you care like you could like see my body
so on Windsor I found one kind of like
it it's just this denim
short sleeve dressed as a pocket and
some buttons on the top and I thought
this is like a clothes substitute and
this one isn't as short as that one and
when there's like really
- so like that was like way cheaper than
three people what and longer and
actually fit me and like really close to
it so you know what I'm saying and the
last thing I got from Windsor are just
these black skinny jeans I'm literally
obsessed they're so cute they've these
huge holes in the knees I just love the
look of these and I also love to how the
bottom has these zippers you see just a
really cute detail and then the bottom
is kind of like frayed this is so random
but I brought this down here to show you
I got this two days ago this is just a
Kate Spade backup battery bank charger
has black and white stripes and I got it
at the AT&amp;amp;T store when I got my new
phone two days ago so I guess this can
be in the haul video - I got new the new
pink with - called rose gold 6s phone
because my old one literally like was
not working it's nice to have a working
phone and the guy told me that he had
these Kate Spade like battery charger
things and I'm like okay I need one you
sold me buddy I went psycho the other
night I ordered so much on forever 21
and I ran like online those are the last
two places I have to show you stuff from
but I don't even know where to begin
because I literally just went crazy in
order to it's so much stuff let's just
start with urban I'll try to make this
the first thing I got is just this flowy
really cute dainty flowery crop top tank
top and then I got this forest green
cardigan from Urban Outfitters and I
thought I can just wear it like out to
dinner over a dress whatever whatever
okay this also isn't very summer related
however I know I can wear this with a
dress - this is just an army green long
vest and I have an army green vest just
like this from Urban Outfitters that
asked them like black like leather
detailing on it but it's short and I
knew I wanted a long one so I get a lot
of one and the next thing from Urban is
just this dress it's like a flowy dress
with all these stripes on it I thought I
thought it was so cute and it has just
kind of used like little details at the
top I love the back of it how it's just
open right there it's like very flowy
it's like more flowy than I thought I
thought it would be like a little bit
tighter so it's almost a little like
frumpy but whatever I'll make it work
you know it's the next thing I got is
just this brown like skinny belt from
urban and maybe I can even throw this on
with this to make it look a little less
frumpy you know the next thing I got
from Urban is like kind of weird I don't
know
how I feel about it it's just this
jumpsuit it goes like this it has these
two really big flowy legs that are like
they're like maybe with like flower
prints I think I was like it better if
it was like a dress like if somehow I
could like get rid of the pans and just
make it into like a maxi dress still
cute I just I think it's kind of weird
that it's so flowy and then it's a
jumpsuit look I'd rather eat just a maxi
dress opposed flowy do you know I'm
saying and the last thing I got from
Urban is just this flowy gray shirt it's
like a peplum shirt kind of like flows
out at the bottom and the last stuff I
have to show you is just stuff I ordered
from forever 21 online the first thing I
got are just a bunch of these pearl
earrings I'm wearing a pair of pearl
earrings from forever 21 right now I
always wear pearls so I thought I can
never have enough I think I should these
one of my last fall's - I got another
pack because I lose them all the time
then I just got this white flowy tank
top just has all this like lace detail
at the bottom that was a little
different twist on a basic item and then
from forever21 just this gray kind of
cropped tight shirt the back is so cute
because it like laces up and kind of
like ties around your stomach like that
and last two things I got our just
dresses and when I was in the store I
was trying to find it but of course
whenever you find anything cute on
forever 21 online you can't find it in
that store it's like impossible is it
just me because I never can but it's
just this really really pretty blue
dress I like love this blue color as
this beautiful pattern on it and the
reason I love it so much is because of
the bottom it seriously so pretty like
look at that print and in this last
dress I have to show you is seriously
adorable it's like this beautiful kind
of pinkish reddish coral ish color I
don't even know what color this is this
is seriously beautiful I don't know
where to the track a bunch so yeah I
think that is everything I have to show
you guys for this video like I said I'll
have everything listed down below in
case you're interested in checking it
