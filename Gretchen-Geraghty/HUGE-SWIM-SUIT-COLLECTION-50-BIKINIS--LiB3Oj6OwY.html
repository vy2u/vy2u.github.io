hey everyone so today I am finally
filling my updated swimsuit collection
video for you guys and I haven't done a
full swimsuit collection since two
summers ago this has been so so
requested and before I start I just want
to say I'm really not trying to brag
whatsoever like I have a lot of
swimsuits I'm just gonna throw that out
there I always have had a use for them
because I've always been a lifeguard
until recently I just stopped
lifeguarding because I just couldn't
handle it with everything else I wanted
to do over the summer like work out
focus on YouTube you know a week or two
ago just stopped lifeguarding but when I
was like groaning I would wear all of
these lifeguarding because the apartment
complex fools I worked at allowed us to
wear bikinis all the ones I'm going to
show you our bikinis is from like so
many different brands and like I said
this is your spend show requesting
honestly the other day I tried on all
them so it could be a trial and they
took like three hours yeah that just
gives you an idea of how many there are
when you're probably gonna want to grab
some like popcorn and a drink for this
video because it's gonna be long so like
get coffee the first place that I'm
going to show you some suits from is
from this online website called Rella
sigue and I just got a couple from there
and I actually showed them in a haul
video not too long ago the first one is
just this red lace with a blue and white
print top and then just the blue and
white print with the reddish pinkish
leastwise these really cool string
details these are just the bottoms to
match and the next one is this all-black
top and I love how it has the crisscross
details in between it's a little bit
push up and then I just have the black
bottoms to match and then the last one
from real estiga is just this yellow
floral print talk and I love have as the
roughly details around the side and then
just the bottoms to match like I said I
show those in a haul video not too long
though but the majority of the comments
a lot of you guys are upset because
they're so pretty and I felt really bad
since they are really pricey bikinis do
you guys know like I love bathing suits
so for me like it was worth it
especially I would wear them like
lifeguarding 4 I stopped lifeguarding
like I said however I'm actually having
a relative giveaway on my
Instagram but it's just for my Instagram
followers my Instagram is that Gretchen
loves PD go ahead and follow if you
don't already so all of the details
everything like that is going to be on
my Instagram so go check it out you'll
be able to tell clearly which picture it
is because it'll be a picture of bathing
suits I thought that would make up for
how expensive they are me doing a little
giveaway for you guys so yeah and also
I'm gonna have those bikinis linked down
below as well as some other ones in this
haul not every single one because that
would take me forever and it would be
impossible to find some links to bathing
suits that are really old I would say a
majority of my bathing suits are on
Victoria Secret which I will get into
but some of them are really old like I
said my swimsuit collection that I
posted two summers ago all the ones I
showed in there are in this one too
because I haven't gotten rid of like any
honest there's you like clean them out
so I don't have links to those but some
of the newer ones and stuff I will have
the links to so to having to check out
the description box because it takes me
a while to get all those links together
one also in case you're wondering this
yellow top I'm wearing this is so random
but this is just from forever 21
I just got it cuz I was dressed in it
for a photo shoot like a part of the
wardrobe and I just thought it was so
pretty even though it's just like a
plain yellow top out crisscross is and I
found it on forever 21 so if you're
interested in this top I'll have it
linked down below too because it
seriously so cutely only order that I'm
really gonna go in is by brand so other
than that sign really any order there's
like a huge pile right here's the next
I'll just show you my bathing suits from
Abercrombie oh and also I didn't even
mention ok I flick there's so much to
say in this video especially this is
like the first video of mine that you
guys are watching I between sister named
Lucy and we share pretty much all these
bathing suits so if you also think like
you have so many like also just think
that they're like split between two
people also before I forget if you guys
know me you know that I love triangle
bathing suits like the triangle swimwear
bathing suits but I'm actually not
showing any of those in this collection
because these are all my bathing suits -
the triangle ones because I really like
the triangle ones and I honestly
probably have like between 15 and like
20 of them so I'm going to show those in
a separate triangle swimwear collection
and if you guys are interested in seeing
that definitely give this video a thumbs
up so that I know you are interested and
maybe leave me a comment because I'm
pretty sure I'm gonna make one of those
but I wanna make sure you guys want to
see it you know so the first half I have
from Abercrombie is just this black
bandeau top which has this really cool
details right here and I just have the
bottoms to match and I next ensue
have is just this light blue floral
twisty wine it's a bandeau and I just
have the floral bottoms to match and
then I feel like it's almost met same
print I just have a yellow band Oh top
that is floral and I don't have the
bottoms just the top and then I just
have these hot pink lace I tie little
bottoms from Abercrombie these don't
have a top I can feel like I'm
forgetting to say things in all these
bathing suit I'm usually an extra small
or small adjust for like size of our
friends and then I just have this white
ruffle eat up from Abercrombie I don't
have the bottoms to go with that I
literally mix and match like every
single one of these bikinis so that's
why sometimes I just have tops and just
bottoms not matching ones some sets I'm
matching them and in the most recent one
I have from Abercrombie my twin sister
Lucy got for me at so cute it's just
this white halter top that's the most
beautiful like detailing right there and
she just got me these blue bottoms to go
with it which I'm seriously so obsessed
with because they're just royal blue and
they like these scalloped edges so those
are all the bathing suits I have from
Abercrombie and now I'm going to show
you the bathing suits ayah from Savile
and they're like really really cheap
they're between I would say all of them
between like 10 and 20 bucks like for
the full set like they're honestly so
cheap and I know recently I did a haul
video specifically with these because
I've so many of them been waiting to
address the comments on that video like
until now there was so many comments
saying that likes Awful's a scam like
they stole your credit card of
information like all the stuff which I
had no idea about like clearly mine
turned out okay like they didn't take my
money or anything so it's just be
careful but I also saw a lot of comments
being like I don't know why everyone
saying this is such a sketchy website
like I order 9 that came within two
weeks they're totally fine and I know
some people are saying it takes like a
while so maybe just be wary that I don't
know how many people actually trust this
website I personally do I know a lot of
people do but I heard that some people
don't so I guess just keep that in mind
but all the bathing suits I have to show
you from sample or like so nice really
good quality I really like them in their
chief so I think it's like a win-win-win
you know and I will link all these down
below since I got them recently I've got
this Daisy print one is just like a blue
top with some pretty yellow detailing
and I just have the bottoms to match and
I just have this white and black top
with just the matching white and black
bottoms and I realized it detail right
there I just have this red roughly top
it's just like a little simple triangle
one I really
this bathing suit sorry if you can hear
people talking in Sears Lucy and Taylor
downstairs and then I just have the red
roughly bottoms to match I have this
pink paisley print one I just have the
pink Paisley bottoms to match I just
have this all orange top some cool
colored crochet detailing in just the
bottoms to match attax babies ones fit
there a little more cheeky then I just
have this halter top but just seriously
one of my favorite bathing suits because
it's just so pretty you can just these
black bottoms to match I like how these
have a little slits on the side to you
then I just have it's dark leaf print
top which crisscross is in the back just
the green leafy bottoms to match I've
this light pink kind of strappy top with
these high-waisted really really strappy
black bottoms hi this orange crochet
bikini with just the matching orange
crochet bottoms also just have it in way
I think this sounds really pretty with
all the different colors with the white
matching bottoms I miss crochet one
looks a little bit different than though
I love how it's just like mint blue
green color and then just the crochet
matching bottoms then I have this other
leaf print one different than the other
one I showed you because it's just like
a white background and these bottoms are
really cute they're just the bottoms to
match this is probably my favorite
bathing suit from here because it's just
so cute it's just white floral top and
the back is really pretty and then just
the white floral bottoms to match then I
have this blue and white tie-dye top
with a strappy back and again just the
bottoms to manage all of these ones from
is awful or like matching sets in case
you haven't noticed then I just have
this maroon one which is seriously so
cute it's just all maroon has a little
braid in the back and then just the
matching bottoms okay this is really
hard
hold up you can just see on it's just
this crisscross see black top and just
the matching black bottoms and finally
the last one I have from is awful is
just this blue and white striped top
with some red detailing and again the
bottoms to match that is all the basics
aside from sample and like I said they
will all be listed down below so now I'm
going to show you all the ones I from
Victoria's Secret and like I said I
think I had the most from Victoria's
Secret and like guys also keep this in
mind like I've been buying like these
bathing suits since like 6 or 7th grade
like I've had them for so long some of
them and I'm about to be a sophomore at
bu so like obviously it's been a long
time and that's why I have so many but I
actually still wear them to like even
the old ones like this is probably the
first one I got like 7th grade from
Target I'll show later but you
I still wear so I have a bunch of these
tops that are all the same style which I
know is crazy but I just love wearing
bando tops because then you don't have
tan lines like bando tops are like
probably my favorite to wear so these
are literally my favorite style ever
from Victoria's Secret I don't know what
they're called but they just look like
this and they're like bruised in the
middle so the first one is just this
really pretty paisley printed want to
actually just for this and like George
the other day and I also have the
Paisley printed bottoms to match these
so just like the Rouge side ones I want
also all of these ones I'm showing you
have a look a little bit of push up in
the bottom which is good and I think
they just look good on I'm like very
flat you can tell the Triad section of
this like I really have no boobs so
those help me like a little bit I guess
not even really but yeah and I just have
the same top in this baby pink color
gonna just have the baby pink matching
bottoms I have this teal top and these
teal bottoms to match and in the next
one I have to show you looks very
similar to that one but I swear they're
a little bit different that was teal and
it's what I'm showing you now is like
more of a mint green it's like a tiny
bit lighter so I just have the mint
green top and then made green bottom I
know I know I'm ridiculous I know now I
just have this coral top I don't know I
keep flipping it this way like okay
that's the inside whatever these are the
matching bottoms I like these ones cuz
they're really skinny on the side
because it's just like a single tie so
these are good for tanning and I just
have this dark purple top which is so
why don't keep living around and keep
doing that this one's black on the
inside whoo but yeah I just have this
dark purple top with you guessed it the
matching dark purple bottoms then I have
this royal blue top which I seriously
love like I just love forever matching
royal blue bottoms and last but
certainly not least I hope that was all
of them I honestly might have missed a
few but yeah I just have it in plain
white and I can wear it with like any
bottoms alright then I'm going to show
you I would say Lucy's my favorite cup
bottoms from Victoria's Secret because I
like that they're cheeky so that you
have less tan lines is anyone else like
that I don't know I just realized the
way these fit I think they're really
flattering and all these is called the
it sea bottoms furniture secret I'm like
throwing them in the air like whoo
the first ones are just these really
really pretty like purpley pink color
love them and as you can tell they're
very cheeky in the back and hey I also
have the top to match and I love this
top this is the only style top I have
like this so it's okay that we're
interrupting the other it sea bottoms
I have this more colors I don't know
what it's called it's just so pretty I
just have these hot pink it sea-bottoms
is really spicy then I just have them in
this white lace color and last - I just
have our all black and this pretty mint
green like teal color my next favourite
top from Victoria's Secret which
actually matched these who like perfect
matches to go with those black kitty
bottoms and really any other bottoms I
just have this black chef's top which is
roughly in the front and I also have it
in this mint green color these are also
very flattering 10 out of 10 would
recommend tonight just have these
push-up tops and like TVT does anyone
remember these I feel like people don't
really wear them as much anymore but I
still have them I just have this Korean
one with blue detailing these are
supposed to be like really push up but
like I'm not kidding guys on me they
like barely do anything so I like don't
have boobs but I feel like in the try
and it looks like a little deceiving but
I swear I really don't have boobs count
how many times I can say I don't have
boobs in this video and I just have it
in this coral and pink color and I swear
it the matching bottoms to these but I
don't know where they are oh this is the
first Victoria Secret bathing's who I
ever got ever and I still wear to this
day like I literally wore it the other
day because it's so good for tanning
it's just this white one with all these
multicolored stripes it reminded cotton
candy in the matching bottom I'm having
way too much fun with this like I just
love you because they just make me so
happy and in that same style I just have
this hot pink one and I just have these
matching bottoms I feel like a lot of
the ones I have from Victoria's Secret
are like the double tie ones or like
itse or like the side ruched ones you
know and this top is also really good
for tanning I know I keep saying that
but this one actually is and it's really
similar to those ones except instead of
twisting in the middle it has like this
little like connector dude and I just
have these all-black bottoms to match
these are just like the side little
rouged ones then I have another favorite
type of bottom from Victoria's Secret
they're just these really roughly rouged
ones because they you just look again
really flattering on I think and they're
just really roughly as you can tell have
them in all black
they reached on the but feel like they
make you about look bigger so that's
always a plus
then I just have it in this white floral
print and then I just have these cheetah
print roughly bottoms which are
seriously so fun and then I just have
this white top from Victoria Secret
which didn't really fit into any of
those categories but it's just all
fringing I don't know fringe abating
suits are still I came by
when they really go huge like trend and
I had to get it I'm starting to realize
I think I might have forgotten to try
and literally like one or two bathing
suits and I don't know if I tried this
on but it's just all black it has like
multi-coloured different strings this
actually might be from Victoria Secret
pink I think yeah most of the ones I
showed you're all from a Tracy group a
couple of these might be from pink so
there's that and then I just have these
coral bottoms to match I think it looks
really good together yeah these are from
pink too and I have to show you from
Victoria's Secret or pink pink whatever
we're all bottoms actually and like I
said I really like the Rouge bottom
cheeky ones I just have these royal blue
ones and then surprise surprise another
royal blue bottom these are really
pretty braided details on the side guys
like come on
you could not pass this up then I just
have these yellow crochet bottoms which
literally I remember used to be my
favorite and I'll wear them like every
single day I still love them I just have
this all white lace bottom okay in this
last bottom I'm really actually
embarrassed to show you guys because the
tag is still on it cuz it hasn't been
worn so that's really embarrassing
because I know I got this like legit two
summers ago but I just found it my
bathing suit drawer and I guess I forgot
to wear it but it is really cute and
it's just like this beautiful mint green
color with all this black outlines and
I've literally just forgotten to wear it
so maybe I'll wear it soon
whew so those were all the bathing suits
I had from Victoria Secret and we just
have a couple more places I just have
one bathing suit from Lululemon
which is just this black one and then I
just have this black and white kind of
like leaf print bottoms to go with that
I'll show you the bathing suits I have
from adore me I think they mostly have
like lingerie but they also have some
bathing suits so I just have this hot
pink top and then just the matching hot
pink bottoms then I just have this white
and mink rain bandeau top which is
crochet have the matching bottoms
Dinah's have this black crisscross top
which I'm sort of realizing is like that
one I showed you from is awful but this
one did crisscross is like not as crazy
as the other one you know if you even
know the waiting suit that I'm referring
to and then just the black matching
bottoms my last one I have to show you
from my dorm use again just another
plain of black wine it's like altered as
this like sign in the middle and again
just the black matching bottoms and I'm
just going to show you the one waiting
to air from Target and this one I like
to kind of showed earlier but yeah it's
just this floral print one which I
seriously got forever ago I think
their mother had this bathing suit I
just have the matching floral bottoms
and then I have one bathing suit from
Midori bikinis I just had this mint
green top I love it and look at the
inside it's pineapple these bottoms
don't really match but I thought them to
go with and they're just these navy
bottoms with this white print and these
are the most cheeky bottoms I have okay
I would not wear these in front of most
people because they're so cheeky but
they are really good for tanning if
you're like by yourself and I feel like
in LA I look on the west coast everyone
just wears like really cheeky bottoms
like to the beach anyway and that's what
everyone does and it's like cool but
like I feel like in the Northeast you I
can't really do that so yeah then I just
have this one being super impacts on
it's just all black this is like the
most simple bikini I have and then just
the black matching bottoms then I have
like one and a half from preffered Tony
one I guess I just have this way really
simple top and all white bottoms to
match I don't really wear this one that
much because I'm kind of scared Smith
see-through and B it's kind of
Warrington's it's just all white but it
probably makes you look really tan so
and then this black top I seriously love
the back is really pretty with all this
like crochet like detailing oh we are
nearing the end my friends

of you like so proud and to prove to me

waterfall the other day if you like
Scott Instagram and it's just as black
and white top it's just a triangle these
have no padding but like whatever the
net by my right and it just has this one
line in the back it looks so cool like

one's also really simple in the back
because it's just so skinny you know the
last and final place I have to show you
bathing suits from are from to die for
