real with you really quick before this
video starts basically I've been putting
off filming this video for a while just
because I haven't been too comfortable
with my body and not even that
comfortable with my body just like
comfortable with having other people see
how it looks and getting their reactions
that that makes sense but as you'll see
in this video I have gained some weight
in the past year it's been gradual not
anything like crazy but I just think I
should address it because I want you
guys to be really mindful of the
comments that you leave on this video
just know that I read them all I've kind
of just accepted and starting to love my
body for how it is and I'm not perfect
I'm still working at it I feel like
everyone can work out loving themselves
more each and every day but I just feel
like a lot of people maybe can compare
my body and how it looks to I go look
right now if you look at my old bathing
suit collection videos and like there
was like a triangle collection I did my
body looked a lot different in those two
videos the first one I was a senior in
high school I had no fat on my body it
looks like I had an outie belly button
because there was physically no fat on
my stomach which is fine I just your
body changes as you grow up and then the
triangle try and when I had a lot more
abs and I still had abs but they're just
under some more fat which is fine and I
really didn't gain weight freshman year
because you guys know I was on the
lightweight rowing team over the summer
and then throughout my sophomore year I
have gained weight but it sort of has
been the best thing that's happened to
me and for those of you that know me you
know why and it's honestly really good
for me and it's making you a healthier
and I'm just learning to love my new
body the way it is just strong and being
healthy but that being said my body does
look different as change I'm not saying
that I'm fat basically I just want you
guys to be mindful to compensate leave
I'm sorry this is getting rambley I
think I want to make a whole other video
about I don't even know exactly what
about but I think there's so much I have
to say I'm like body image and just like
loving yourself and I don't really know
because I'm still on that journey as
well but I just wanted to throw this in
here really quick at the end of this
video because it is a video that is very
personal it's me trying on bathing suits
and a lot of them was me trying on
bathing suits at the end of a vacation
in Miami and obviously on vacation I
don't you guys I always gained my on
vacation cuz I'm like woohoo party and I
just like eat so much food and I'm not
thinking about healthy eating when I'm
on vacation I'm saying so anyway I
haven't even actually looked at the
clips of me trying on bathing suits yet
but I just I mean I can feel that my
body has changed I have gained weight
and it's laughs II would say my body
looks like I just want to throw this in
you're really quick just be mindful of
the comment that you're leaving just
know that I read them all and yeah I
hope you guys enjoy this video hey
everyone so today I have a video that
I've been wanting to film awhile for you
guys and I just have a bunch of eating
suits from Savile which if you haven't
heard of it it's this swimwear website
but I'm pretty sure it's like Chinese so
honestly I got minutes just can you
really real with you guys when I did a
video with them before showing you guys
bathing suits that I got from there a
lot of comments were negative of people
saying that like they didn't have a
really good experience getting bathing
suits from there but I honestly love
their bathing suits I always love them
and then you guys know when I was just
in Miami with my cousin Mandy like all
of our pictures on Instagram were
wearing bathing suits from his awful and
I got so many questions of people asking
like where we got them from Mandy and
her friends always order bathing suit
turns awful and they have like no
problems with them so I really don't
think that you guys should and if you do
just obviously like reach out to them if
like your bathing suit you're taking a
while to calm or anything but like my
enemies come super quick where we get
started I guess I'll tell you I get a
small and everything in some of their
bathing suits a small is like perfect
for me sometimes a small is too big like
the red one and sometimes a small is too
small
so I'll talk to you guys about that
they're sizing is a little hard they do
have sizing charts that you can like
look off of so first off I'm going to
start with my favorite ones this is just
as purple like braided top it's super
cute and then I have the matching
bottoms I just braided and another thing
I'll say about their bottoms is I would
say yeah they're all like pretty cheeky
so if you're not into that
just know that but I like cheeky bottoms
cuz I like my butt to be damp so yeah I
don't want
up and then my next favorite one is just
this royal blue top and a super cute
it's like like this net material in the
back it scoops like really low which I
also like and then I just have the
matching bottoms which again cut quite
cheeky but it's fine and then they're
like kind of braided inside my nest
everyone is probably this red one that I
just got and it like crosses in between
like that and then I got these matching
floral bottoms which we got these look
really small link them up and some are
like this isn't that stretchy material
but then like other ones are so I guess
just be wary that like the first two I
showed you they have really good like
stretchy bottoms he's really kind of
like not that much I really like this
white one has off the shoulder I thought
I didn't at first but it's like really
cute honest so you could wear it as like
a top and I just comes with a matching
white bottoms and then I just got this
navy blue top that's halter with like
white around the sides and I feel like
I've seen this one experience I feel
like you and then I just has the
matching bottoms so they just go with
that top just to explain with me at
remaining on all these bathing suits
some of the try and I did in Miami so I
was like very very dark it was like the
last day I was there and then some of
the trends I did when I came back so my
back was like really peeling just like
explain that because it's like that's
confusing that I trust one excuse every
time I'm oh yeah I really like this
white one that I got it all just bunchy
in the front and the back is really cool
I like the details on the back of this
and I really like like the bando type
ones or panning and then the bottoms are
just plain white again and they let go
with the top it's like these cool
details okay I really like this cool
seashell top it's just white and they
look like seashells and preacher that's
what is going for it comes with these
navy blue bottoms which the front looks
like the back which looks like front so
I got this one one piece in five
different colors because I thought it
was really cute and like so this style
of the one piece is like perfect like it
fits so well it's a good quality and I
honestly love them y'all just say if
lost please return to my squad so I'm in
red on the back it was really low they'd
be really cool for some insta-fix got it
in black got it in what this looks like
- yeah I got it from me in my squad but
sadly they came the day after marathon
so dead so he couldn't even wear them at
a time and then I got it and it's a
copper blue color seems really pretty oh
my god then then I got it into the white
color oh and this one is black letters
then oh we actually I really love these
one pieces I got to this white one I
think I was wearing an Instagram did I
post here's a picture of me wearing this
one with Mandy and it's just white as if
birthdays fly because when I just think
it's so cute and it fits like exactly
the same as those other ones and then
this black windows as well it says Rose
a all day and I just thought these are
really fun but then these two are a
little bit different this red one I'm
like not a huge fan to be honest just
because very very wide and like loose
like you can tell like these ones are
not the same fit as the other ones and
this one's padded but the other ones
aren't so that's kind of different as
well and yeah it's just like really
loose but I still think it's really cute
because it says daywatch but just know
that like this does not fit like the
other ones and then I just got this one
piece which I thought was really cute
online and I really took Laurel print of
it and I like that it laces up so the
only thing is is you can see when I'm
drying on I felt like it was very
revealing because the Lisa part goes
like really really low like all the way
down past your bellybutton but it's so
really cute and then I goes like really
low in the bag so I like this just know
that it's a little risque I have this
top which is floral and actually so cute
I really like this one it's not padded
it's like printed so it's like fine it's
really cute and then it comes with these
like aqua blue bottoms okay I like this
grey one as well it's just like plain
and yeah I just go playing skinny little
bikini and then add these or matching
little bottoms and then this I feel like
okay either the three of them like it'd
be about because this white top I feel
like it's supposed to be like the other
seashell one but as you can tell like
you can even see it's like flat so it
looks kind of funny on but maybe if you
maybe you can try to like bend it
really no to like fit your boots floral
bottoms I actually really love these
like I love this tile them and I think
they're so cute but the only thing is on
me like I don't know if it's just this
pay or whatever but I felt like the
front kept falling open and that you
don't want to show like the whole front
of your bottom area you know I'm saying
this one I thought was really cute
online I like that it has these like
strappy details but then there's these
weird little rings which I feel like I
don't know maybe you guys are into them
I don't know I'm kind of scared of them
you like to print of it though like
snakeskin great I thought was cool and
the bottoms are honestly where I have
like the biggest problem they're just
like very revealing because there's only
like a tiny bit of cloth in between and
then all the cutouts go really really
opening wide on the side you can see a
lot of your body which again if you're
into that cool but I don't know and then
this one I really think is cute and me
and Mandy really really love this one
because it's just like plain black with
cool seashell details but the bottoms
like these are not stretchy and they're
like very very small and tight but these
are better than the top because the top
is just like I think guys can tell like
this is like very very small I feel like
it would fit like an eight-year-old but
if you're like really really little like
smaller than an extra small maybe this
fit you it's cute yeah just the sizing I
feel like it's messed up on that all
those meetings foods are pros awful I
will have the links down below to them
so you guys can check them out I don't
want you guys to like be mad at me for
making this video because I love the
bathing suit so for a while like I know
some of them my problems with but there
is some like really really good ones on
there and I hope that's watching this
video helps you find they're really good
lines season ones I love because
honestly the first two that I showed you
the purple and the blue one are like my
favorite because I have so I really
would recommend them and oh they're so
good just because they're so affordable
like you're way better than going to
like triangle and 7 spending like $90 on
a meeting - you know what I mean so I
feel I could help you guys out
especially since it's almost summer
thank you guys so much for watching this
video and I'll see you next
boy okay ready guys ready you know I
always say hey everyone like three times
