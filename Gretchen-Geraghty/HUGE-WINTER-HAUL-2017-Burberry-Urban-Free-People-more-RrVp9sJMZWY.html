haul video preside I've been meaning to
show you guys this stuff for a while
sometimes stuff I actually forgot to
show you that I got from Christmas I
just forgot to show it in my Christmas
haul video and some other stuff I've
been getting just shopping after
Christmas I some exciting stuff too
because not all of it is closed some is
like a yoga mat makeup candles stuff
like that
but first things first I want to make
you guys aware of an app called Poshmark
and probably all of you are like what's
an aggression we know what Poshmark is
we'll probably want to know that I had
some clothes that maybe I don't wear
anymore or clothes I don't fit me a lot
of them don't fit me Freshman Fifteen am
i right so a lot of them are still
really cute like literally they just
don't fit me so I just want to show you
guys at my profile my username is just a
Gretchen with five ends and here is what
my closet looks like I have all these
things it's still available for sale
today and tomorrow I'm going to be
posting like 100 things cuz I so much
stuff back at home that don't fit me
anymore that I don't really wear
definitely always keep your eyes out
because throughout the rest of the
spring semester I'll also be posting
stuff to buy didn't even say yet
Poshmark
obviously just like a community where
people can sell buy clothes and what's
nice it's really discounted for example
I brought in two things off there
recently one of which are these
Lululemon couplings that people always
ask me where I get them and I'm like I'm
really sorry like you can't even get
them anymore
I just found them on Poshmark and I love
them as I found them on Poshmark I was
just like oh I love binding stuff on
there that like used to be toilet little
lemon or SoulCycle or American Eagle
urban outfitter you don't I mean that
people have that the stores don't sell
anymore and I'm like yes I wanted that
and also I got this grey SoulCycle tank
top not only used stuff people sell new
stuff to attach so for example for some
of the things I'm going to be posting
for the next couple days I just grabbed
this shirt which I love so much I'll
wear this shirt literally every day from
brandy melville so first what you want
to do is just click on the Sola and then
you can take a picture of it and I like
taking pictures just against my bed so
there's like a nice like white
background behind the scene next what
are you selling brandy melville moon
shirt for the description I just wrote
great condition one size category
women short sleeve shirt so I think the
original price was probably around 20 so
I will list it out in 13 lists so there
it is as you can tell I use Poshmark
literally all the time whether
it's like buying and selling - I should
buy and sell items - like it's so fun I
mean you probably already are and you
guys should definitely sign up with my
code because you will get five dollars
off of your first order after you sign
up and you can use the code msg su if a
hundred of you use my codes then I'm
going to do a giveaway because I haven't
done a giveaway and so on I'll let you
guys know how many people use my code
literally just like leave offers on
stuff on there if you're interested in
it you literally just offer like ten
dollars melded okay sounds good to me
and obviously I don't know if it's not
obvious you can download the app for
free I'll have it linked down below keys
guys are interested so the first stuff I
want to show you guys I actually don't
have all of it with me because some of
it is back in my dorm at BU and some of
it is here so the first two things I'll
show you are these big white fluffy
pillows in the background of my video
and you what two of them would look so
great on my bed back home I will link
everything that I show in this haul
video by leg down below you can check it
out the next two things that I got that
are actually on my bed right now a PU
while we're speaking I just got this
gray do they cover it's for the twin XL
but you know the standard size of it at
dorms I've been wanting a great duvet
cover just to switch up my room because
before I just had a plain white one I
also got the sheet set that's like
printed and I just got this hello
beautiful pillow that goes with the more
neutral like theme of my room at school
because it's just black and white
and I've been getting so many questions
about these bowls I've been chilling my
snapchat stories and on Instagram and
such I just got these four white bowls
in a set from Norma Phi they just say
YUM enjoy eat and TC or the perfect size
for acai bowls and Louie Bowls guys so
obviously that was like perfect for me
and it's so good to have them at school
because I love like cooking vegan and
just simple foods in my room so I just
got this little jewelry racket just is
like white simple command
rack with some pegs so that's perfect
for necklaces and such then I just got
this faux fur blanket so soft and so
fluffy and I would highly recommend it's
so warm Lucy and I will cuddle up with
it at school and just watch some Netflix
this is all my most favorite things that
I got from Dhirubhai and they're just
these Kate Spade and nesting boxes which
are like the prettiest print so useful
guys I love them I just have them
stacked up in my dorm it just gives you
way more organized so I'm in love with
these boxes the last three things that I
got from dorm of I up kind of not
applicable because after the holidays
but I got them like at the beginning of
December so I did yeah okay so they're
all so cute and they all go together so
I just got this
and Golda strike one like how to you I
literally have these hanging up at
garages realize they still have the tags
on them look I'm so dumb I never took
them off good Gretchen's good but I have
like all three of these hanging up in a
row so they look super cute and trendy
and they semi says naughty on one side
and then just nice on the other and it's
like a black and gold again and it just
has the pink and gold stripes again you
just look just so cute together and I
would highly recommend for maybe next
Christmas you know and Eli sees the code
aggression loves Norma Phi for 20% off
your purchase so go wild next up I just
have to show you guys stuff that I
forgot to show on my Christmas haul
video my mom was like Gretchen you
didn't even show what I got you those
like mama love me in Safari so the first
thing my mommy got me it's just this
certificate to get a massage which I
actually just made the appointment today
so I can get a deep-tissue one hour
massage thanks mommy love you and then
this was my stocking and I was like what
the heck mom why did you get me like an
ice pack but she was like they just gave
it to me when I got your massage
certificate and it's a comfort to gel
pack oh you can freeze it or microwave
it so that would be good for my back
since I have back pain a lot of times I
also got to show you guys what Lucy got
me which is like so sad because these
are just the cutest things ever so the
first thing she got me is this pumpkin
and spice a candle I think it's from
Urban Outfitters oh yeah there's a big
Urban Outfitters guys this smells so
good is it me or he like see the vein
like popping out my neck oh my god about
to like possibly die so what am i doing
anyway this candle seriously smells so
good oh no they still fellow there they
still have what if they do go smell it
or if you have it you know what I mean
this loan so good oh my gosh I'm still
gonna lie to even those after like fall
who cares
that means Soph she got me I really hope
I can find the link to these like I hope
they're not like sold out or I hope I
mean still like sell them I opened them
up and I was like Lucy what the heck I
was laughing so hard
so that first glance you probably just
think right after these you know nice
blue socks some birds in flowers
but no on both of them on the outside
they say pimpin ain't easy I was like
what the heck I just think they're so
funny in so cute and I've already worn
them a bunch so thank you so much Lucy I
love these oh also this is like a big
one that I forgot to show my Christmas
haul I got this new
from a lemon I think it's a
five-millimeter one because I wanted to
really stick Kempelen it's just for
screen and I've already used this a
bunch at yoga and I loved it guys I
would highly recommend this one this is
a Christmas present from me to myself by
the way I like research because I wanted
a good one because you guys know I'm
considering becoming a yoga instructor
that would be really fun a lot of the
reviews for the yoga mats were kind of
questionable and some people again we
don't like them they are like not that
good I don't know but I was like you
know what I'm just going to try this one
out and I really really like it and I
actually got this through the DOE app
which I'm going to talk about all the
time you guys know it's just a shopping
app this isn't sponsored by them by the
way I think I always have to say that
but I know if you use the code
aggression you'll get five dollars off
and free shipping off your first order
so it's like essentially a $5 gift card
to like any of the stores on man urban
Lululemon Zara Sephora American Apparel
like they literally have everything in
every store that I ever shop at they
actually had this on there which I
thought was so interesting because I
thought it was like just clothes but I
guess they had any of them back to so I
got this through jokes and oh yeah I use
my collection
you're welcome free five dollars in free
shipping so I think these are the last
things that to show you it from a
Christmas and I'm just going to take
these puppies off right now so I can
show you my aunt Chris actually the
other pair I don't have with me right
now but she got me two pairs of fuzzy
socks the first pair but if he's fuzzy
solid like purple ones but then these
ones are my favorite these little guinea
pigs all over them so I love these thank
you so much and Chris and she also got
me guys this choker like she's so cute
it's so trendy and was just this silver
choker with like little silver like stud
and it's really cute as a choker but
also what I realize is if you just wrap
it twice around your arm it's a bracelet
which I love and I was like aunt Chris
you know me so well with are literally
like always only wear silver jewelry
glitzy where she got it from it says
Toba designed in Montreal so the next
two things I got I feel really weird so
that I can like show you guys because
last year when I actually did bro I
couldn't talk about it at all but now
after the fact I can say that I did row
and whatever so you guys I think it can
get these but I just got these two
shirts for supporting be 130 rolling
because you guys know I wrote on women's
lightweight rowing team
geraldine university but i saw this year
in the fall because i just wanted to
focus on youtube in school and growing
was just kind of too much for me to
handle in college so I just did it
freshman year but I still love my team
I'm still best friends was like so many
of the girls and I'm so happy that
everyone was like so accepting in my
decision and they totally supported me
anyway I just got two shirts this is
just the view 1:30 rolling shorts red
t-shirt yeah I'm just going to support
my cows even though I'm not running
anymore
and obviously Lucy still Rose so yeah
and this is just a buing long-sleeve at
dry fit shirt and it says box on the
back and to advert comedy I just got
this black romper
I showed this in the blog as well it
goes like the right there in those front
II see it's like shorts on the bottom
but it's long-sleeve I thought it was
really simple and like very wearable and
I can wear this a bunch in Boston I can
even dress it up or dress it down to
this like more of this what's it called
chiffon material literally I haven't
bought pants in like two years because
like I mentioned earlier okay this is
going to sound so bad we say this all of
you are going to be the catch in job I
don't think I've gone pants in like two
years I'm not kidding because obviously
as you grow up you get bigger not
everyone but I mean most people as you
age you maybe gained some weight so all
the pants I currently have are like very
tight fitting on me but I don't like
buying new ones and admitting that I
have to like go size up you know but
finally I was like okay Gershon it's
timeless you literally don't have any
pants so I did get two pairs of jeans or
Abercrombie I just got these highly
suits sort of medium wash ones I don't
know if you can tell see how high up
they go B smells so good too and I
really like the way Abercrombie jeans
fit all my jeans I currently have are
from Abercrombie - they're just like
smaller but you know it's okay we move
on I have these unless the darker wash
as well I wanted plain black jeans for
so long
with like simple rips in the knees just
like one rip on each side so I like love
love love these and these ones are weird
like I don't know if you can tell they
don't have sizes like the other ones
they say ever coming to Signature
Collection so I don't know that like
changes anything
but they aren't like 0 to 4 like that
like these I think say I don't know
where it says it oh yes it is
waist 26 so they're size like guys
almost like aren't guys
like that but anyway I really like these
as well and finally I got my clean black
jeans with it rips and the knees so whoo
one day me and Mandy once them all
quickly we had to just run in to go to
American Apparel which I will show you
right after this and then when we were
leaving she had to go to the bathroom in
Nordstrom and she left me alone for too
long and I got to looking and I was
looking at the Burberry coats and I was
like oh my gosh I need a new winter coat
I'm going to get a Burberry coat and I
just decided to get this red one and
like holding it up in person right now
it looks like this bright red but
brilliant person is more like a dark red
I love that it has a plaid on the inside
and the main reason I got it because it
has a hood and I was going to get in
black but then I was like you know what
Gretchen branch out of your comfort zone
2017 is a time for change in the time of
growth if I can find a link to this I
will link it down below because I know a
lot of their codes look alike and I
would probably have a hard time finding
this if it was me trying to find it all
right back to this stuff from American
Apparel those coming out this is like
the whole reason we drove to go to that
model is because we wanted some Bolly
suits and good thing we did because I
got three of them and they were having
like a 40% off sale so I was like heck
yeah I got this maroon bodysuit that
just like the you know classic halter
one that I feel like everyone gets at
American Apparel I wore this to a white
gana concert in the city and I looked
really fierce I wear this with the black
ever combi jeans then I just got these
at two body suits that are the same this
is the whole reason literally I wanted
to go to American Apparel was to get
this black body suit and I wore this on
New Year's and it just goes like really
deep V in the front long sleeve and it
almost looks like a leotard and I also
got it in white because I was like why
not this thing is like so cute to eat
just like crosses like that on the front
but it goes really deep with the other
body to end up wearing with sticky buns
and also the black one I did as well
just because you don't know like a nip
slip like literally if you're as small
as me you really don't even need to key
boobs
maybe if you're bigger to I don't know a
lot of people do like sticky boobs and I
actually showed this exact pair pair of
sticky boobs that what it's called
this is the exact one that I showed in
my why wear under my clothes video which
surprisingly got lots of views it was
just a video all about bras because
people ask me all the time because I
wear like open back stuff all the time
and like deep plunging stuff and people
are always like do you not wear a bra
with what bras do you
so basically I got a new pair of these
puppies because my other ones are really
old and lost a lot of their stickiness
so these ones are like super sticky
because they're like brand-new oh I mean
it's like ours these are from Airy
because I just think Ariel is the best
one and you guys know of any other
stores have really good stick-on bra
leave a comment down below so I'd love
to know of some other ones too a tryout
and I'll go can you give me an A and
she's like yeah hold oh I'm going to get
it on the back and she's like oh no like
sorry we actually have bees and bigger
and I was like but but like literally
I'm a good double-a like what am I
supposed to do and maybe he's like it's
okay I could be will fit you and I
looked at it and I was like hopefully
it'll fit
Loki if you're an air you can fit into a
because it's really not that much bigger
is so proud of me like moving up in the
world yeah we went to free people that I
just saw these green pants they were on
sale in the back there all by themselves
and alone and I was like this is time
from God
Gretchen they're your size you need to
get them and like I think Cassie you
some socket size like this let's see
this is 26 so I don't know maybe that
should have some storage size or clothes
I don't know but like I said they're
just these green pants there's Cole with
designs on the knees and then they just
have one zippers on the ankle I wear
them out to dinner the other night with
this coat and I was like hey I look like
Christmas
nearing yet I three more things to show
you guys one of the things I got
recently I had to order online and
advance the international model because
here in the US this camera is sold out
completely everywhere what I got is the
canon g7x mark ii and if you guys
subscribe to my vlog channel you
probably already know that because I've
been vlogging with it for a while I'm
something with it right now because
honestly I the Canon Rebel t3i and
literally filming with it is not as good
as filming with this so like why
wouldn't I somewhat this am I feel
really funny filming with it because
it's got a little plate and shield and
it's not even like a DSLR the canon g7x
mark - I'll have it linked down below I
just ordered this on Amazon and I've had
no problems with it it's amazing by
canon g7x the first version is sitting
over there and that poor poor thing has
been through the wringer I dropped it a
million times the screen is crack it was
a sonic last one I think it's really
going to best meant my friend Brooke
actually told me that she could like
notice the difference in my videos so
yeah and it's basically the same as the
first one but better Oh Anna has a
little grip thing on the side which is
really good for me so I don't drop it if
you guys have any recommendations of
good DSLRs for filming or good lenses
that I could get please let me know in
the comments down below as well because
I gothy I forget what lens model it is
but I'll insert it right here I got this
type of lens for my DSLR and I film
tomorrow what I got for Christmas haul
video in it and I hated the lens I
couldn't assume in in it so I returned
that puppies to Best Buy you have any
other lens recommendations comment down
below maybe I just need to get a new
DSLR I don't know with the t3 I was kind
of old oh no has there been this weird
shadow from my camera this whole time
and the next thing I was going to tell
you guys that I got I got from Amazon
again and it's just this ring light that
is right over there I'm really dumb and
I didn't realize when I ordered it
online that it didn't come with an
attachment to my tripod so most people
look how you're supposed to film with a
ring light I think it's like around your
camera on your tripod and mine is
literally like hanging up on a hook on
my wall right there but it's still like
doing the job and if you guys know I'm
like obsessed with a spinning Parker and
the whole reason I got this ring light
is because it's one that values my
talked about in the video and they had
it like linked in their description box
I was like oh I'm going to get the one
that they get so go to the page for this
ring light look at it and if you guys
are like tech savvy let me know what
attachment I need to get for it for my
tripod and this is a little case that
came in by the way it's a brand new ER
the last thing I'd to show you last but
not least I went to Sephora I was like I
gotta get this palette that this girl
was talking about Kristin Maria I think
she's engaged to that guy used to be a
Viner
and Lucy my friend Julia were showing me
their really cute couple videos I think
I was look at new year's look and she
was showing what she was using the power
glass ambient palette she decided to
look the best thing ever and like the
colors look so pretty it was really
going her so I was like I need it so if
you made it to the end of this video
Wow like literally Congrats I'm so proud
of you this video was so long we made it
to the very end
go comment doughnut just the word
doughnut on my latest Instagram picture
and it can be our inside joke and no one
else will know what it means it's gonna
be really funny okay thank you guys so
much for watching this video don't
forget it
I started bajillion times before but
everything that I showed will be linked
down below so it can be very helpful
through the edge thank guys so much for
watching this video and I'll see you my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
