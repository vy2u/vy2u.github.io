hey everyone today I am so excited for
today's video and when I say excited I
mean sunsetted because it's a huge haul
video there's like so many clothes and
shoes and jewelry and it's collected
because some of the stuff you've seen
but I haven't really talked about it so
I'm going to talk about it right now and
I'm so excited so let's just jump into
it the first thing I actually want to
talk about before we get into haul video
is this app called style kick and it's
so cool it's like this app where you can
see a bunch of different outfit ideas
and I literally get addicted and I just
scroll through it like all day but
what's really cool about it is you can
like double click it and you can like
like it to look at it later or you can
even click on this little thing right
here and it'll show you where the
clothes are actually from and you can
buy them which is like so cool because I
always wonder like where people get
stuff and you want to buy you know but
you never know so that's what this stuff
is like so cool for and it's actually
links to my Twitter so you might see me
if I post some pictures on here I might
share them on my Twitter so you can
definitely see the pictures that I put
on there - I think it's like super cool
and I have it all linked down below for
you to see yeah without further ado
let's just get into the haul video so
the first thing I will show you is this
scarf you guys have definitely seen me
wear this a lot
and I'm literally obsessed I'm already
wearing another scarf but let's just
double scarf it and it's literally so
fuzzy and more I'm wearing in a bunch of
my Instagram pictures new guys look it's
definitely from Burberry like no it's
not those scarves are actually so cute
but they're like really expensive like
infinity scarf which is what I love
about it and I still haven't even said
where it's from its from this website
called moon cats and I kept forgetting
so that's why I kept like not being able
to tell you ever on because I forgot the
name of the website but it's called moon
cats and actually if you want 30% off of
all their scarves you can type in the
code Kirsten loves beauty 30 and that's
linked down below too so you can go
check it out because this scarf is
literally life and it's like so adorable
and not like a million dollars like the
Burberry one it looks a lot like it so I
don't forget to check that out and use
the code Gretchen loves beauty 30 if you
want to get 30% off of this beauteous
scarf so the next things I'll show you
is actually a pair of sneakers and you
probably saw this picture on my
Instagram and that's what these are
right here so I have a little confession
they're actually boy sneakers but I saw
them and I had to have them there the
Flyknit Free Runs I'm just seriously
obsessed with these and I needed a new
pair of free ones because mine are
getting really worn out and I see you
working like blisters and I was running
TMI but yeah they're like darker grey on
the outside and like lighter right there
and they're seriously perfect and I just
love them so much and I read that decree
practice and I can run in them and just
workout in them and the cross train in
them and I just think they're beautiful
and obviously I didn't care that they're
boys that's how beautiful I thought they
were but if you decide to be weird like
me and want to order them in boys make
sure you go to sizes down because
they're boys so girls you feel me no I'm
saying the rest I have stuff from
Victoria Secret pink Lululemon a lot
from a little lemon oh my gosh
I literally have donated my entire life
savings like Lululemon like shout out
Lululemon you have all of my money
currently I have stuff from brandy
melville I have some from Topshop and I
have stuff from Toby and black 5 so
let's just get into the rest with his
haul video so a lot of this time is like
post Christmas shopping and Lucy and
Mandy actually went into the city and I
actually met a bunch of you guys I'll
put in pictures right here oh my gosh
you're amazing
I'm at like nine subscribers in the city
which was like crazy because I do not
think I would run into so many of you
but yeah I was awesome meeting you and I
love meeting you guys here seriously the
best it was like the day after New
Year's we went into the city and I got
way too much clothes so that's what I'm
gonna be showing you here the first
thing is from Victoria Secret pink and
it's just this teal zip up sweatshirt
and thumbs up this video if you liked
Ryan Hall is because I tried all this on
and takes me forever to edit it so
thumbs up this video if you liked Ryan
hauls it's just this teal sweatshirt
that says pink and black across the
front and it zip up and I just have
really been wanting a teal sweatshirt
really bad because this is funny but
justin has a teal sweatshirt and I think
his is from like Nike though but I
really wanted a teal sweatshirt so I got
this one from pink because I liked his
Joe sweater so I had to buy a tail
sweater if you then I guess we'll just
get on to the stuff from a Lululemon
because we all know I have an obsession
there and this shows you how much I'm
obsessed I have two different bags oh
yeah so the first thing I will show you
is just this scarf I got it's like
purpley periwinkle and then white and
purple Eve periwinkle stripes and I also
have this in grey and like black already
but I seriously just love these scars
they're called like the vinyasa scarfs I
think they're like the ones you can wear
like ten different ways and they're
seriously awesome and I was buttons and
like stretchy and that comfortable and I
just love this like periwinkle color so
I had to have it then I found some stuff
on sale like tell me how good this is
I found Lululemon cropped pants for $29
like do you see this oh my gosh I
literally was like jumping up and down
they're awesome someone told me they
look kind of purple there like greyish
purple I guess crop leggings which I can
wear to work out in so it's like perfect
and I know it looks funny as I'm holding
them up but it's because they're like
rused right here at the bottom when
they're on you obviously they lay like
flat on your legs and these are just so
awesome for like working out and they're
really thick I don't know why they're on
sale but I'm so happy they were because
usually Lululemon is like a million
dollars so this is so good that I found
these for $29 like what a steal am i
right then I got this yellow tank top
because I didn't have a new yellow tank
tops and I saw they
I was like I should have yellow tank top
to work out and you know and it's just
this like high-necked yellowy lime tank
top and Lucy actually has this in red
which made me want it because at first I
thought it was kind of weird having like
high-necked stuff to work out in but I
just really liked her red one so I
decided to get this lemony lime color
and it's like so good for working out I
love their tank tops for working out
then I got this like magenta purple tank
top which also is like high-necked and
like that in the back it's kind of funny
you're looking in the back but I just
think it's really unique and this one
was also on sale guys $19 look can you
believe it like I literally am such a
bargain hunter I can't believe I found
both of those for so cheap like I'm so
proud of myself and this one's really
thick too and then they sign is eyes go
a little bit crazy I just saw this and I
was like I had to have it it's this
black puffer vest from a little lemon
and there's actually this like little
reflective thing right here and it's
kind of like a slimmer fit you're
supposed to wear it running so that's
why it's tighter so if you were running
you can like see at night and I just
think this is literally perfect and I've
already worn it to school it was a
little bit of a splurge but I think it's
totally worth it and I'm stuff is like
really good quality I really love this
because I've been wanting a black vest
so bad then the last thing I got from
Lululemon is seriously my favorite thing
ever I am obsessed look at this color
it's like pinkish purple like orchid I
don't even know what to call but it's
literally beautiful and I saw it and I
was like I need to have it and I
actually have it in gray I know because
I really like the fit of this one moving
on to a brandy melville loop I was so
happy that we were able to go to one in
the city because we don't have one where
I live which is like pretty obvious
there's like five and like the whole
world I'm pretty sure but the first
thing I got is this grey sweatshirt and
it's like super soft like literally so
soft it's like a blanket it's actually
cropped and just like long-sleeve gray
sweatshirt and it's so comfortable and I
just like snuggle in it look it's the
softest thing ever like you know the
inside of sweatshirts it's like that on
the outside and the inside so it's just
like so snuggly warm and the next thing
I got is this sweater which is just this
gray long sweater and it's like cable
knit and like show thick and warm this
is just gonna be awesome for the next
few winter months
because it gets so cold Mary live and in
school too like during the day I like
actually freeze obviously Bernini malval
I had to get some of these stickers
because who doesn't get like a million
of these stickers when they go am i
right then I got these like boyfriend
jeans which I don't really know how I
feel about them or boyfriend jeans in
general because I always think they're a
good idea but then I really don't like
the way my legs looking them they look
kind of like frumpy and funny-looking
you know but I mean it Lucy try them on
and I really liked the way they looked
on her but they look better on her than
me but that's beside the point so I got
these I bought boyfriend jeans and I
just think they're so adorable look at
how many rips they have and I saw them
and I was like they're so distressed and
like really cute and you know if you
like cuff the bottoms with like some
booties like those Steve Madden booties
I have I don't know I guess it's kind of
out of my comfort zone just because
they're so like this dressed and like
loose-fitting and usually I wear like
really tight like skinny jeans or
leggings and stuff but I do like these
and making myself wear them will make me
grow as a person and try new styles you
know oh and then the next thing I got I
actually can't like show you in my hand
because it's in my room above my door
and it's another one of those signs if
you saw a haul previously I got a sign
from brandy melville and it just says
brandy Melville with like a heart and
that's look above my closet and I
actually got another sign and it says
locals-only and it's like above my door
that goes into my bathroom I'll insert a
picture right here it's just kind of
different and honestly I got it because
I just wanted another sign and like all
the other signs we're like swearing they
said like f you and like New York City
biatch like I didn't want a sign that
swore in my room you feel so I just got
the one that says vocals only but I
thought that it was kind of cute did you
just see how many tries it took me to
get that Wow
okay and then the last few things I have
to show you that are from the city are
jewelry pieces and this one I put a
picture on Twitter because it's
literally beautiful and gorgeous and I'm
obsessed with it it's this necklace from
j.crew and I just think it's so cute it
was like on sale too and it's like gold
and purple and like periwinkle love
periwinkle
and I just think it's so pretty like
tell me that isn't the prettiest
necklace you've ever seen
I love it I've been like obsessed with
statement necklaces
like that's from j.crew and then these
last two things are from Topshop and
Topshop had like a really big sale and
like their jewelry like everything was
like 75% off so I just got this dainty
like silver necklace and I think it's so
adorable it just has these like little
beads and it's so like simple and like
perfect and a little good with like all
my jewelry see love silver are we
surprised no more silver just like the
jeweler of mine right now I just got
these like stackable rings and there's
like some mini ones that are smaller and
some bigger ones and yeah I just think
these will look so super cute with like
land with other rings and other jewelry
and now I will show you everything that
I got from Toby which I will have linked
all down below you should definitely go
check it out because I'm obsessed with
everything that I got from Toby of all
the pieces linked down below you should
definitely check out their website
because I'm seriously obsessed with
everything on that store like I
literally would buy everything am I good
the first thing I got from Toby is just
this pink dress and it's so adorable and
like flowy at the bottom and I love like
the fit of it on the top how it's like
tighter and then it just flows out and
it's like super cute like transitioning
into spring can I even mention spring I
know you could even write in the winter
to it like tights like a sweater then
this dress I actually got purposely
because my school has a winter ball
dance and I don't know if they're gonna
have it this year but hopefully they do
because I got this to wear to it and
it's this black flowy dress with black
sequins at the top and I love like the
cut of it how it goes like deep right
there and it just flows out it's like
strapless I like getting these like
black simple dresses because this I can
keep forever and like wear when I'm
older too you know that's like a staple
piece I feel like in your wardrobe the
next thing I got from Toby I'm so happy
about because I think I've mentioned it
to you guys before that I really just
have wanted a dark green army like
anorak jacket I haven't been able to
find one that I'm like completely
obsessed with but I'm completely
obsessed with this one so you'll
probably see me wearing this like
literally every day and it's just this
long like an Iraq military jacket and
it's like zip up and has some buttons in
a hood cuz that was a big thing for me I
really want to do it online and a lot
that I were finding didn't have hoods
but this does and it's the perfect shade
of like dark green
I love it the next thing I got is just
this maroon anorak jacket and it's kind
of like that one but it's like thinner
it was like suede and soft and so good
for layering as you see this is also
like link down below and this is like
seriously so unique I think cuz like not
that many people have maroon and rock
jacket then I just got this gray sweater
that is like really simple and just knit
and it has kind of like speckles in it
it's like making like something simple a
little bit different perfect for
layering with scarves and jewelry and
it's super thick and cozy warm too and
then the next thing from Tobi are these
jeans I will show you they're just these
black high waisted skinny jeans and they
have little holes in the knees and I've
actually been looking for jeans that
just have like holes in the knees like
that for a while so I'm so happy I came
across these and I just think they have
really cute like sweaters and foody's
the last thing I got from Tobi is this
sweater that is so snuggly soft and warm
I feel like a lot of stuff I got in this
haul video was like really snuggly warm
it's just this sweater and it's kind of
like ombre effect a little bit I don't
know if I would even call this ombre but
it's like tin at the top like speckled
in the middle and then gets black at the
bottom and it's so soft and literally
will look perfect with like leggings I'm
seriously obsessed with it and I just
think it's so so cute
finally the last place I have to share
with you guys is called black 5 it's
this like online website and they have
lots of cute clothes that will also be
linked down below you should definitely
go check it out the first thing I got is
just this tan jacket and it's really
like thick like wool material it's like
an outdoor like winter coat you know and
I was like fur on the hood so this is
gonna be so good for wearing into the
winter because it gets like really cold
here in upstate New York and then I got
this sweater and it's like this mustardy
yellow color because I have like nothing
that's like mustard colored and I really
just like dressing up like basic things
you know and then this next winner I got
from black 5 is also the same like
mustard a yellow color it's basically
like the last thing but it's like a
cardigan like that has sleeves it's kind
of like halfway sleeves and I got this
red sweater from black 5 which wow I got
a lot of sweaters in this haul video
it's this red sweater it's like pullover
and cable knit and like really warm and
thick like all the sweaters I got are
like so thick and warm and then the last
thing I got is actually this sweater

so going to be perfect for like layering
I just know I can wear it in the winter
too with like tights in Boots and
sweaters it'll be so cute it's just this
