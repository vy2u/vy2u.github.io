I've worn them before things are just a
few more jewelry pieces from forever 21
this is just this like pack of earrings
and a bunch are out because like I'm
wearing something right now and yeah
it's just a bunch of earrings like
pearls and diamonds and stuff these are
little bow earrings I think they're so
adorable and then I got this I got two
gold necklaces that aren't that
different this is just a gold necklace
with like a sparkly ball really cute
and then this is a gold necklace with
like a gold just like little heart and I
realize these like little necklaces I
think they're adorable I got this blue
like periwinkle blue bird color sweater
and it's just so pretty and cozy most of
the sort of I'll be showing you or just
lip pull rooms like this like really
cozy and warm and thick and awesome so
yeah I really like wearing this and this
is my last offer to keep you so bad next
from forever 21 is just another pullover
colored sweater that's really cozy and
soft and I love it and it's just this
peach color and once again interesting
it and really pretty and warm and cozy
and this is like all I wear in there
like wintertime so yeah I realize that
and then another sweater from forever 21
is this black pullover just pick knit
sweater and it's really
yeah so those are all pretty similar and
then also from forever 21 this blue and
white stripe infinity scarf yep and
that's just like knit I've got a lot of
infinity scarves recently and then also
from forever 21 this light pink infinity
scarf with like silver kind of metallic
like strands in it so yeah okay one more
for this forever 21 this is just cream
like a short sleeve shirt and it says
love and I really like it and it was
pretty cheap I think too so yeah that's
nice and it'll be good for laying
underneath like a black cardigan you
know and then okay last forever 21 which
I just ordered and it just came in I'm
really happy it's this white coat with a
pea coat with like black details on it
and I absolutely love it this isn't me
so cute because right now I have a black
pea coat but it's getting pretty small
on me so yeah I wanted a white one I
think this is so adorable
so yeah I really like that and then oh
the only thing from hmm I'll just show
you I got so they still oh stuff in the
last month like excluding Black Friday
if you haven't noticed so this is just
hope with some again some like metallic
II kind of like threads in it and so
yeah it's like that and then you doing
random places this is from American
Apparel and I actually ordered this on
my because I don't have one in our store
and this is maybe blue it's called the
circle scarf so you can see if this
thing is huge because she it's so
freaking big and yeah so it's like
really figure it'll keep you warm and it
can go around once or twice so I really
like that and then so I'll show you from
UM Urban Outfitters I got a bunch of
stuff today I got this silver like
pyramid bracelet I really like that and
then harder you know I'll show you these
I'll take this
the next thing I got from so those are
two things that I got from Urban
Outfitters then the next thing was just
this other sweater of course it's like
cream was kind of like brown and pink
and I don't know it's just like a bunch
different color so I really like that
and I think it's super cute and then I
was done I promise and some stuff I just
couldn't find so I can I show you I'm
super sorry but yeah that's just how it
worked out so I got some more stuff from
forever21 that I just couldn't even find
show you and then I had my brain email
little stuff came yesterday first I got
this white giselle top and this will
look so cute with like a high-low skirt
or high-waisted jeans or shorts and yeah
the reason I bought these high-waisted
jeans from Urban Outfitters it's to go
with this tank top actually this is also
came yesterday from brandy melville and
it's just this white um elephant tank
top and I've really been liking it but I
have a really long torso so this doesn't
even go out with this is my belly button
this doesn't even go to my belly button
so I knew I would need to wear like
high-waisted something with it because I
don't want a whole stomach hanging up
you know so I got these high-waisted
pants and it goes perfectly and so yeah
and this was just the white inches on
top it's actually pretty small but yeah
it fits so and then I got this tan
sweater from brandy melville and it's
called the Stephanie knit sweater and
it's really really big oh my gosh this
thing is huge it goes way past my buck
and it's kind of like a little bit
hi-low if you can see and yeah just
another thick really stretchy or size
sweater so I like that and then this is
the last thing I almost done in Paris
yeah so yeah this is the last thing it's
just this black kind of bralette thing
and honestly I got this is something so
bad I got this because I wanted to buy
more stuff there because so much stuff
that was in my bag was out of stock
so upset like the sage sweater if you
know that so I'm like there's like this
teams I was like like a rib cage iPhone
ones and that was out of stock so yeah I
just got this black little bra what and
then it has cutouts in the back it's
called with the geo top if you're
looking online so yeah and that's pretty
much everything I had to show you um
that's everything like a name like in
the package is yesterday so I wanted to
put that mixture on Instagram like whole
question marks that is what I was
meaning and yeah sorry so so much stuff
