haul from New York City I went to New
York City IMATS if you didn't know I
posted like two videos already about
that and I went shopping afterwards in
New York City okay if you saw on my last
haul video there is a giveaway for IKEA
house today was the day that I picked
the winner and I used random Network so
it would be completely fair I don't know
how to say their name so it's just gonna
be right here so you want my giveaway
thank you so much
I've already messaged you so yeah that's
you mean you and me but for everyone
that ensure the giveaway like thank you
for entering I got a lot of enters and
if you didn't win definitely just enter
the next giveaway I have and I know I
didn't have like an official video for
the winner but I figured that if you
enter my giveaway you watch my videos
anyway so you'll see right here and so
so I didn't make it a separate video but
I'm mentioning it right now and you're
the winner and congratulations so right
now in my basement because there's
really like no good lighting like and
you are in my house so that's really
weird that I'm sitting in my basement
I'm always like somewhere new
but yeah so if you wondered where was
that service but okay you got some cool
things that I wanted to share with you
actually I might only got five things
and pour them we're nail polish so it's
not even hurt that big of a deal
first I'll show you the lip products I
got from OCC and it's in this little bag
actually it's exactly like the brand
name a little bit but that's beside the
point
I got me obsessive compulsive cosmetics
lip tar and the color hush and um it's
like a pinky new like lip tar I like it
a lot I'm not worried right now if
you're wondering I'm wearing like a MAC
lipstick and lip gloss but whatever um
but I really like this a lot and I will
definitely be wearing it and it stays on
like forever with my friend head went on
and I really would not come on for her
lips so this is gonna be really cool and
this was $12 I believe and usually it's
like more than twelve cuz I'm a stuff is
like discounted and then a really great
deal was I don't know if you know but
China Glaze nail polishes are usually
like I would say between like seven and
nine dollars from where you are oh look
it's my cat he wants to get out okay um
third-years like between like seven and
nine dollar
depending where you are and I'm actually
had a deal for five for 15 which is
obviously amazing because it's a minute
four dollars nail polish and you get
them in this big huge tote bag and it
says China Glaze living color and it has
all these polka dots oh yeah this is
cool and I'll definitely keep that bag
maybe for like the beach or whatever but
my friend actually bought one of them so
I only have four to show you and I don't
know what I was thinking like we're kind
of in a hurry and I was kind of
distracted like meeting people but we
got three blue nail polishes and they
all are very very similar but one of
them is the color kinetic candy I don't
know it's really pretty it's light blue
and I like a lot I've so many light
blues like that
and this one looks just like it this is
the color bohemian escape I was just
like a medium blue it's really pretty
and then this one is Sunday Funday and
my sister wanted this one because of the
name it's like a darker blue like
they're all very similar like light
medium dark is so we probably have like
way too much w damn flash like we be of
all blue nail polishes it's crazy um and
then this one's called pinky promise and
I saw my sister run it this one too
because of the name it's like a light
pinky purple and yeah they look really
cool and we love nail polish we have
like a problem we get so money
my favorite store ever is brandy
melville and we don't have one where I
live here in New York but they do have
one in New York City and so I got a lot
of stuff from brandy melville and I also
ordered already mobile so getting
started um first from brandy melville I
got this like sweatshirt thing I feel
like everyone has this and they come in
like a jillion colors and this when I
order it online it's like a blue gray
color and I like it a lot and it's
really stretchy and comfortable so I'm
just wearing it right now this ring and
I don't know if you noticed but I
literally I have like no jewelry like an
average of the weeks I'd never wear
jewelry and even if I do have jewelry
I'm I too lazy to put it on so um I've
made myself buy jewelry and this was
just
sitting on the counter like randomly and
I just picked it up and I was like Oh
miss Purcell but yeah I really like it I
don't know it's just like blue and like
silver this ring was $7.00 and then from
brandy melville I got this um moon
t-shirts I think it's called the Chloe
mm shirt I don't know if you're like
looking online it's like a black t-shirt
with a bunch of moons and I know they
have this like the tank top too but I
wanted the t-shirt one um just because I
like the cut of it and I have a bunch of
tank tops but I don't have a lot of luck
t-shirts and I already wore this I like
it a lot and uh I'm in the last haul I
did people are asking for prices so I
believe this was like $30 or maybe the
29 something like that and this one was
20 that like stickers that say them yeah
then I got this tan um long-sleeve shirt
and it has buttons right there and it's
flowy and really comfortable and I like
it a lot and all their stuff is really
soft like oh this is like so like
stretchy and soft and I want to say this
was like around $20 I'm sorry I wore a
lot of this stuff already and I so I
took off the tags
um but yeah you'll see in my next outfit
of the week it's like all brandy
melville week because that's I wore like
all my new clothes
um but yeah it's like really stretchy
and nice and I want to say it was a
little over $20 like something like that
okay next I got this tank top and it's a
tie-dye um like cut tank top I don't
know if you can tell what I mean I cut
like it's like stretchy and like it
doesn't have like you're not I mean like
that like thin like end it's just like
cut off looking like slouchy and cool
and stuff and I really like it I look at
like things like that for like the
summer in spring this tank top was $17
and this I didn't get this time I
burning my bell but it's also from
brandy melville that I've had in the
past and I just wanted to show you like
this is what I would wear it's like a
band oh I think they still sell it and
it has like slits in the back sorry I'm
trying like show you um and I would wear
that with it so if you're wondering what
I would wear yeah then next for any Malu
I got this dress and I'm obsessed with
this dress
I've never seen it online but I got it
in the store and um I know it's I want
to see like a light purpley gray with
these like black detail prints and it
flares out right there and it's
short-sleeved and in the back it has a
little hole and it crisscrosses and yeah
I had liked it a lot
this dress was $30 kind of short because
dresses that Brittany will usually run
pretty short on me um I don't I think
that's just like the way they're made
and i'm 5-8 if you didn't know him I'm
sure a lot of you know cuz I feel like I
say that a lot but so yeah it is kind of
short on me okay sorry my cat's right
there and he's outside and he wants to
come in hold on George feel like kitty
he always wants to go outside and then
I've let him back in but that's what
sighs point okay
next from brandy melville I got this
honestly like grayish Brown is shirt I
would say and it's really stretchy and
comfortable that's like what I was going
for and that's like all of their stuff
basically um and yeah I wore it also
this week and it was $21 okay next I got
this online sorry this is like all mixed
up like some of this was in the store
some of this was online but um the stuff
that I ordered online came the day after
I got back so it's I got it like all at
the same time this is gonna be really
hard to show you on camera and my friend
called it a blanket but kind of is um
it's really big my voice tracks it's a
really big tan like chunky long sleeve
sweater and it's so long it went down to
my knees people at school were like what
you wear um cuz I wear this to speak as
well and it has a hood and I love it so
much that when it's really comfortable
and soft and this was $60 and I know
it's pretty expensive but I mean I've
seen that on their website for a while
and I wanted it so I decided to go ahead
and buy it then lastly from rainy
Melville I got this white tank top and
it says Los Angeles Angela
Los Angeles I'm pretty sure that's how
you say um love child tank top
California um and yeah it looks like
that and the hands go like in LA you
know and then it says love trial right
there uh whatever that means but I mean
it's pretty cool again pretty hipster
he's kind of tank tops almost oh the
cuts called Sadie if you look at like
their different tank tops um
Sadie tank tops are supposed to go like
I'm pretty sure past your bellybutton
like almost too like if you're wearing
jeans at your belt you know like if it's
supposed to be like a full tank top but
on me it's cropped like it goes right
above my belly button and I have so many
of like this kind of tank top and I wear
them to school on people like I can see
your stomach and I'm like I'm really
like I'm not trying to sell my stomach I
just it's hard for me to find team cups
that go all the weights like my jeans
because I have a really long torso
um but yeah that's just something
something else and it's so it's really
not supposed to be a crop top I'm not
really sure but it is on me um but my
it'll thank you different obviously so
yeah I really like that and I think it's
cool and it was $20 so that is all I got
in New York City and that is it for my
home thank you so much for watching and
I'll see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
