exciting to share with you I received
something that I was really excited to
get because it helps your skin and I'm
really into like things that are helping
like prevent bad skin instead of
covering it up so recently I've been
spending more money on things that are
like promoting healthier skin instead of
covering up bad skin do you know what i
mean so instead of opting for like
expensive makeup I've been acting for
more expensive usual treatments and
cleansers toners things like that so
today I'm going to be showing you the
PMD or the personal microderm and it
just looks like this right off the bat
like it's really nice packaging and
everything just video at the back of the
box says it says powerful convenient
immediate results promotes cell renewal
and rejuvenation using the combination
of exfoliation plus suction professional
microdermabrasion has been around for
decades and has been clinically proven
to give you younger more vibrant glowing
skin this personal microderm unit uses
the same aluminum oxide crystals
embedded in the top that are used in ten
thousand dollar machines found at your
doctor's office which I totally agree
with about the cell renewal and
rejuvenation um combination of
exfoliation plus suction so we'll just
open it up and when you first open it up
it comes with this nice little disc that
I've already watched um and it orally
explains like how to use it cuz when i
first got it I was scared I was gonna
like messed up or something but it
totally is like in-depth like what to do
so you can't mess up and then you have
this nice little instruction booklet um
just to read through as well that was
nice and then you have the actual PMD
which is just the whoo the tool that you
use um it might look a little scary but
I promise it's not and what it does is
it like when I first got it to I was
kind of like confused but on basically
it like takes the top layer of your skin
off like it exfoliates it so that your
skin produces like new skin cells so you
have like nice like younger skin and
I've already seen results I've used it
for like the last two weeks my skin feel
softer and like my moisturizer
I feel like is more like effective and
it's like sinking in my skin and my
pores have gotten smaller which is so
big for me because I've really big pores
so if this is like minimizing my pores
like I'm sold like this is awesome
because um that's something that I
really struggle with it comes with this
little cord thing that you plug into the
wall and then this and plugs into the
PMD and it's like it's plugged into all
as you're using it and then and then it
comes with like different heads and see
that's how you do it to you hold it
right up against your face and you have
to it explains in the video you hold
your skin taut so that that's the way
its most like effective okay so
basically when you use it it's just
plugged into the wall and you turn it ah
and you might be scared because it makes
a little noise but that just means it's
working and you hold your skin like this
and you move in upward motions just like
that and your skin will get red because
that means it's working it's taking the
top layer off of your skin to produce
that new soft skin that you're looking
for so I really think this has been
helping my skin so so so much I've
definitely seen the results my makeup
goes on smoother my moisturizer goes
down better my toner my acne products I
think are working better because my skin
can really suck in all the things that
I'm putting on it and I don't know if
you noticed but my skin is really
looking a lot better than it has been in
the past I struggle with acne and this
is just really been helping me so yeah
it comes with a blue disk a green disk
in a red disk and the blue disk is what
i've been using it's for sensitive skin
and then the green disk is the medium
strength one and then the red disk is
the maximum one um I don't have very
sensitive skin but I just started using
it so that's what you're supposed to do
any first get it anyway so your skin is
more used to it the grants for medium
strength abrasion and the red is for
maximum strength abrasion so abrasion is
just the actual like taking off of the
top layer of skin she's also really neat
because you're small this for like your
face obviously and there's larger ones
that you can use on your body so say you
have like problem skin anywhere else or
you just one like exfoliate somewhere
you can do that so you take this and
you're holding your skin taut and you
move it in upward directions and you
don't pass over one section more than
twice because that um that's like too
much for your skin do you know what I
mean like you just do it once and then
replacing the head look in there is
really simple you just like twist this
out and you you just pull that out and
also there's like a black filter in
there you can see and you just pull that
out and it gets dirty and then you just
clean that with like rubbing alcohol or
so you ate six or seven days between
treatment so I just use mine once a week
and I really really have been seeing the
results the PMD is really great for me
because it has better results than a
professional microdermabrasion treatment
plus it's a lot cheaper so that's
awesome and also it helps reduce arms
it's an acne which is so awesome because
I've acne prone skin so this is really
really great for me and anyone else out
