exciting video for you and today I'm
going to be talking about tea
specifically I know you guys like when I
do kind of like fitness and like healthy
eating videos they're like always super
requested and I actually just put a
picture on Instagram of what I'm going
to be talking about which is a company
called your tea and specifically the tea
called tiny T and it's actually like a
tea detox cleanse i would say which is
like if you haven't heard of it before
I've actually been wanting to try a TD
talks for a long time and it's just
those to help with your like digestive
system and help like basically clean all
the bad stuff that's in you out and it
just kind of detoxifies your system
while this video is totally dedicated to
this tea I want you guys know that I
will always be giving you my like one
hundred percent honest opinion and I'm
going to be showing two different teas
that I tried out this first one is
called on the your teeth the tiny t like
28 detox and I actually went through one
box already this is my second one and I
already started to make it done on my
second box um this is what I that I
mainly tried it really liked a lot and
this one I've just tried a few times
it's like the energy tea because I
always wish that I had like more energy
and so yeah I think both of these have
helped a lot with like my energy levels
which is like one thing that they're
good for they make you feel like more
awake and other thing that was like a
big seller for me on this is that it
helps with your skin and I actually
didn't notice but the first week I
started trying it my skin did improve
and I think it helps to with like
hydration just because obviously it's
like water that you're putting the tea
bags with since you're putting in water
so you're drinking more water and like
for me that's good because I feel like
it it's like hydrating you but you like
forget that you're drinking water
because it's like tea so it tastes good
um so i think that helped my skin in
that aspect to which is like really big
for me because you guys know that I
struggled with acne along I don't even
know if it's supposed to do this but I
also feel like I kind of like regulated
my metabolism a little bit like it kind
of made my metabolism speed up and I was
like more hungry often but I was eating
like really healthy with it and I want
to let you know too that it is supposed
to be a good detox like it's supposed to
help kind of like clean your out and
cleanse your system it helped me a lot
like after Christmas and Thanksgiving
cuz I ate so much junk you have to make
sure that you're eating healthy with
to look you can't just expect to eat a
bunch of junk food and eat this and feel
like refreshed and look more healthy
because it's supposed to be in
combination with good food it's supposed
to help aid with weight loss which is
really like Matt what I'm going for a
tall guy really don't need to or want to
lose any weight like I'm fine the way I
am but I know it can help with weight
loss so that's that's another reason you
might want to try it but you also have
to know again that you can't just eat a
bunch of junk and expect like lose
weight on this also you can drink it too
if you're like me and you're not trying
to lose weight and you just kinda want I
like regulate your metabolism and
digestive system I'm not gonna lie I was
kind of bad with the whole extinct on
schedule you're supposed to drink like
two or three bags a day and it's
supposed to be like half an hour before
you eat a meal and I kind of drink it
like willy nilly like I would drink it
in the mornings before school if you
guys watch my vlogmas you know that I
was drinking this all the time um in the
mornings before school like every
morning out drinking like when I got
home from school a lot of drinking so I
would drink it like two times a day a
lot and I drink it like a lot of
December so that's like all the tea I
was drinking during that a lot of you
guys were asking what tea are you
drinking and i just didn't really
address it because i knew i would
address it in this if you were wondering
what ti was drinking during my progress
it was usually this and i guess i'll
just open it up and show you because
i'll go and make a cup after this anyway
and to me it smells really good it's
like really herbal it smells and tastes
like herbs just so you know like it's
not gonna taste really fruity or
anything so some of you might not like
it some of you might not and it's just
your basic like tea bag and yeah it's
just like really Irby and i remember in
the beginning to when i started drinking
it I always had like load it with like
sugar and honey and stuff which probably
isn't good because you're trying to use
it like cleansers is to not drink a
bunch of sugar with it but then as I
went on I just drink it like straight by
itself cuz I I don't mind the taste I
think it tastes good but you might not
like it so it's just different depending
on the person remember it's made with
like Chinese medicine herbs so it's
actually is really healthy and like
clean for your body so it's not one of
those things that's like oh this is like
healthy but has much like junk in it
that's like secretly you don't really
know look it actually is really clean
for you it's like clean for your body
also I know there's like a gluten-free
version for people
our gluten-free which i think is really
nice to have that option I think it
worked for me also because i work out
constantly like I really work out all
the time um right now I'm in the middle
of my crew training and we work out
literally all the time with constantly
like I could not gain weight if I tried
yeah I really did like this and I like
the energy 12 sometimes I'll just drink
this during the day I don't have as much
to say about this though because I
didn't drink it as much as this look I
told you I finished like seriously whole
box it's kind of like an added thing
like you can't really just do it on your
own and expect to lose weight you're
like be really healthy and skinny all of
a sudden like it's kind of on top of
like eating healthy and exercising
because i did it with both of those two
things and that's our notice a
difference but so you can't just like
drink a bunch of these tea every day and
be like why am I not getting skinny and
also don't expect to just drop weight
because I don't really think I lost
weight on it like I didn't want to I was
eating and working out just normal like
IE so much you probably noticed my blog
misses 2 and also i know that a 28-day
box can be pretty expensive in price and
their cheese aren't cheap like I'm not
gonna lie so I know for some of you that
might not be like ideal but um i just
thought i would share this with you guys
because some of you are wondering what
ti was drinking so i want like share
with you yeah i know there's like
alternatives that might be cheaper you
could do that but it does have like a
good like cleansing effect and I really
did like this if you guys wanted to try
it out another thing I will say to be
completely honest i know t is supposed
to help you with floating but this I
really didn't like notice that much at
all like my stomach sometimes will get
bloated but I don't feel like it really
helped that much it just kind of didn't
do anything teen generals you're
supposed to help with like bloating but
sometimes I'll feel bloated and like I
don't know t is just never helped me so
this might not be even like relevant
because I feel like he never really
makes me feel and uploaded ice didn't
really do that for me but I know that's
something that I can do so it might do
that for you and I know if you look skip
a day or two or if you forget to drink
it that's fine I just don't think you're
supposed to drink like 10 glasses in one
day but if you just drink like one one
day or like two or three that's okay but
just don't go like crazy I guess cuz
that might mess you up I don't know i
think i will continue to drink it
whenever I'm just in the mood sometimes
I'll do it like before I eat
after i work out i'll just drink a glass
because i like the way to taste too so
yeah but i'm like warning you if you
don't want the way to taste this might
not be for you because it is very like
herbal tasting it tastes like herbs like
the chinese herbs that it's made out of
it even says you can add like honey and
lemon and stuff and it'll still be good
if you don't want the way taste normally
on its own and that's all i wanted to
say on this i really did just like it i
think it's a cool idea i like the idea
behind it like giving your system a nice
little cleanse and detoxifying toxins
and it supposed to like let out the bad
