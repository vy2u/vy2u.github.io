and snack idea video um I just wanted to
do this because I've done some more like
nutritious snack videos before and I
thought I would do another one I know
you guys really like that this one's
going to include a little lunch idea and
some snacks and before I get into it I'd
like to mention a subscription you guys
can become involved in it's called grace
calm and it's a subscription snack
service for snacks that can get
delivered right to your door or to your
office wherever you work they're just
better snacks more nutritious than like
ice cream in cupcakes and cookies that
kind of thing so it just comes in this
nice little box it was actually founded
by a group of friends that got sick of
the same old junk food like chips and
cookies and they wanted a more
nutritious little snack idea they
actually just came to the u.s. in
January
it already has hundreds and thousands of
subscribers across America that get
their nice little crazy box there's also
an extensive range of like the varieties
as I said go in here I believe there's
over like 90 different snacks that they
put in this box so it's always telling
me you never get sick of it snack thing
you guess and actually every step in
here comes with a little nutrition badge
so you can feel totally comfortable
eating everything in here knowing that
it's way better than for you that other
bad snacks and every box actually
contains four different snacks perfect
snack in size I think it's a really
really great idea if you're at work or
and you're busy you don't really have
time to like pack up your healthy little
snacks then this is awesome for you and
I forgot to mention before but down in
the description I have listed the link
that you can use to get your first box
free with the code summer snack 11 and
that is listed all down below so go
check it out
so let's open my box and see what I got
so first it looks like it comes with a
paper that explains everything
then a jalapeno Fiesta nut mix which is
spicy and really good and those
pistachios are so good I love pistachios
then some dried fruit and popping corn
so as you can see everything I got was
really really tasty
with some popcorn and not in berries and
stuff like that and actually that part
looks so good to me there's black pepper
night and I'm obsessed anything with
pepper these perfect like furniture
school or into work its litter to your
work that's so awesome I think it's such
a great idea for those of you that are
like on the go have like an active
lifestyle you just don't have to worry
about having your own little nutritious
snack and you can just get that
delivered right to you but without
further ado let's get into my other
snack in the lunch idea and these aren't
crazy healthy options but they're better
free even like a peanut butter and jelly
and chips
it's nice alternative with some veggies
and Turkey in a wrap and also some like
low-fat cheese and like pretzel crisps
which are a lot better for you than
other kinds of things so I know these
aren't like amazing and like they're not
only fruits and vegetables but you can't
when they live on for your vegetables
anyway so please don't comment down
below saying they're not healthy because
there's still a better alternative that
lots of other foods so yeah let's just
get ready so first I just have your
basic turkey lettuce wrap and first
thing I'm using a whole-wheat wrap which
is better than you better for you than
like the really white like flowery ones
and then I'm doing a thin layer of
hummus and my favorite turkey ever which
is peppercorn turkey you have to try it
then I'm just breaking up the lettuce on
top because it didn't fit it was too big
like long weighs in just its own little
like romaine leaves but yeah I'm just
breaking up with my hands and then I put
onion on it because I really like onion
I'm struggling to close it because I
always over stuff it but I somehow
manage to just roll it up and then I cut
it in half so that it will fit
conveniently in this little container
that was literally made just for it I
swear like it's perfectly but yeah I
just put it in there and I can throw it
in my lunchbox for school look like an
ice pack and it stays cold and brush all
that until at lunchtime and then for you
snack was just so basic and so easy and
you can use Ritz crackers if you want to
would I help you out alternative is the
pretzel crisps butter right there and
that is it you laughing cow cheese which
is like like low-fat like it's like not
that bad for you and it's like the
garlic and herb kind which is my
favorite it taste so so good until
creamy and you can dip the pretzel crisp
in it and yeah it's just my favorite
good and those are all my stacks thanks
