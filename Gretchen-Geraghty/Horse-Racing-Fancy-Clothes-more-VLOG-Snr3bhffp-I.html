Justin and me and his mom and his dad
are going into the track today and his
older sister Jacqueline and her
boyfriend Aiden or actually in Cape Cod
so they're not coming with us I don't
know why I'm telling you that I just
just so you know that's why the whole
fam isn't there I'm really excited that
we're all going and it's currently like
9:40 9:45 I try really quick because I
want to film my dorm hall video didn't
have time to do it yesterday and I was
kind of not in like a good mood to film
cuz I got him kind of Lee and it was
there anything dark out and I was like
really sad and I cried the whole way
home cuz I don't want to go to college
like I'm engineer my other blog and I
got so much stuff to show so I hope I've
enough time to get ready film and go to
Justin's on time to go to the track when
it opens today is opening day so excited
yeah I figured talked about the track
for those of you that don't know it's
just horse racing with if you know I
live in New York and you know the track
you know exactly where I'm going yeah
there's probably other horse racing
tracks well I know there's other horse
racing tracks that you guys might go to
but if any of you are from like upstate
New York you know exactly I'm talking
about like everyone goes there
and even if you're not from New York a
lot of people come and go anyway it's
not that close to where I live it's a
little far away but anyway I think my my
new dress from Urban Outfitters so
that's exciting
it's like a maxi dress and Justin's
family his uncle actually owns horses
and sometimes always at Saratoga so they
always have like box seats so we're
gonna sit in the box we have to dress up
really fancy and I hope my maxi dress is
like fancy enough when I saw horses -
it's really cool because before the race
we can go and like this little like
gated area with all these flowers and
like see the horses and there's like a
bunch of pictures you take and I don't
know it's really cool you get to me like
all the owners of the horses and stuff
I'm super excited today so excited so I
finished getting ready and filming my
dorm room Hall look at all this junk and
I still have it so much more stuff that
I need to get like moving into college
you're so stressful you what I mean
but yes oh I've been is getting
I'm wearing this necklace that I just
got in the mail from happiness boutique
I was showing a hobby soon and then I'm
wearing this dress from Urban Outfitters
that I showed in a recent home video and
I'm so obsessed with it just look at the
back of this how cute is it it's all
like crisscross II I gotta go I'm
leaving like right now to go meet Justin
at his house to go to the track so yeah
and like I remember to my new watch and
all my little silver bracelets outside

I'm wearing my new nude sandals with
those little gems that I showed my home
video to love those guys Lucy just got
me and dropping me a bunch of sins and
guess what she went to the mall and
she's known I want I wanted these like
dark-wash ripped jeggings from American
Eagle forever except a lot of times they
don't have my size and they're kind of
like expensive and I never just bought
them but I always wanted them and
they're just like dark wash jeggings
with rips all down them
I was like reaching for that guy was
like would you get she's like no and I
was like what you get and I just grabbed
it she's like no and she's like screw
you I got you
they probably better on her because
she's gotten so much thinner than big
you remember you see pants in like such
big sizes
Lucy we get such big sizes and they
first of all she always would get them
loose so they didn't really fit her
anyway I don't know she would just
always get paying so big so you were
never the same size but now we like all

not in the same room except we got our
room assignments and we're three doors
