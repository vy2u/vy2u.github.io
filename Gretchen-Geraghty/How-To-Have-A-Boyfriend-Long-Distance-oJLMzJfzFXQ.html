title of this video I was just going to
be about relationships and just some
advice on how to deal with long distance
relationships especially during college
because I just finished my freshman year
at Boston University and I'm going back
in the fall
my boyfriend his name is Justin in it
you have probably seen videos with him
too I know my most popular video here on
YouTube is the boyfriend tag and I took
right it'll be three years so it's crazy
that we've almost been dating three
years I never thought I would have had a
boyfriend
junior senior and like all the freshman
year of college but yeah that's just how
things worked out and I feel like I'm in
a spot where I can give some advice and
I just posted a picture on Instagram and
I said comment your questions about
long-distance relationships it's
actually really early at night right now
as I remember like not making sense if I
sound like really tired if you don't
follow my Instagram you don't play
it's that Gretchen loves fede
go follow me but I'm just going to be
answering as many questions as I can for
you guys the first question is a good
one it says how do you ingest and make
time for each other and seeing each
other on top of schoolwork and other
things yeah so basically with academics
athletics social life like everything it
is tough especially being at different
colleges when you're gonna be making
obviously like new friends but you want
to spend time with them too and
academics I feel like for me we're just
really rough especially in the fall so I
guess you really have to prioritize
what's most important which is obviously
like academics or at least they should
be academics you know like if you're
paying money to go to a university you
should prioritize your education and
then move your boyfriend or girlfriend
but I would just say yeah if they mean
enough to you and if you really want to
see them you do make time for it if
someone wants to see you they make time
for you if someone says they care what
they never made time to see you think
about if they really do care because
they probably do how often do you
address in tech slash call like all day
every day we're just the type of couple
that text like constantly all through
the day which i think is good cuz I like
communicating a lot and I like being in
touch with them and knowing what's going
on I know some couples aren't like that
I have some friends ab boyfriends or
girlfriends that they don't text all day
every day they just don't like doing
that so I feel like it's personal
preference and we probably talk on the
phone
almost every day if not every day when
we don't see each other what is the
hardest part of being distant from each
other so I feel like for me it's just
physically not being with him which is
like obvious
but I think you kind of take for granted
when you go to the same school with
someone or you live in the same town as
them and you're dating them because you
see them so much in person like
physically that you obviously just get
used to that but when you're away from
them for a while I feel like a lot of
the times long-distance relationships
struggle solely because you're just
physically not with them not physically
being with them I feel like a
detrimental to your relationship and
just like being able to like see them
and like touch them I know that sounds
weird but I feel like that's just
healthy for a relationship and you're
gonna kind of forget what it's like
being with them I think that's a lot of
the reason longest relationships don't
work how do you deal with missing them
and not being able to see them as much
as you would like I think I definitely
struggled with this in the fall because
it still was like a big change from
going to the same high school and seeing
each other like every day so I feel like
I would get sad a lot which I guess is
just normal and you can't let yourself
get too sad it's like that's a lot of
the reason to people break up like at
the end of the senior year but I think
we just both mutually decided to like
we're in a point where like we both
still really loved each other and we
want to try to make it work and we did
and I'm so happy we did because now it's
summer and we get to see each other all
the time again this question says do you
feel like you always have to know what
the other person is doing and then the
next one says how do you keep the trust
so I think those kind of go together
no I think I'm kind of like a clingy
like crazy girlfriend but I know there's
people like way worse than me like I'm
really not that crazy and like yeah I'd
always love to know what Justin's doing
I'm like very like interested in like
obviously why don't I keep up to date
like what he's doing but it says how do
you keep the trust and like literally I
feel like you just have to decide that
you're gonna trust them like I trust
Justin so much like you just have that
trust with him another like that's
something that you like build when
you're together and you talk about when
you have a long-distance relationship
obviously you have to trust the other
one because you're not gonna be with
them all the time do you believe that
distance makes the heart grow stronger
and I feel like it can in some cases and
maybe not in others I think for us we
have times where I remember I would just
get so sad I'm like Justin like it's
killing me like I just want to see you
like if we'd have to go for like a month
without seeing each other but I don't
want to sound like insensitive cuz I
know some people like among distant
relationships like literally can't see
their boyfriend or girlfriend for like
five six months at a time you know so
for me I guess I was just really used to
seeing them like every day so yeah I
would get sad and if you're like really
sad all the time maybe doesn't make the
heart grow stronger
in distance but I only would see each
other again like when I would finally
get to go visit him or something like
we'd be so excited to see each other it
just makes you like appreciate the
person way more and like makes you
realize how important it is that you
guys did say together because you did
have such a good connection and it would
really sting to just throw that all away
because you're gonna go to college
partway this one says if y'all have an
argument how do you solve them all not
being together I feel like in person
it's just way easier but if you're like
fighting over text you can't really like
feel their emotions you just like see
words or if you're like on the phone or
something
I'm like having all that distance you
feel like you don't really know how they
feel so I guess topping them you just
wanted us like be the bigger person you
make okay like let's stop fighting like
you love each other like what are we
doing how do you manage not seeing them
for so long
facetiming I feel like would always make
me feel better and like thank God we're
in a day and age where our technology is
so great that we can FaceTime each other
cuz gosh and back in the day when all
you could do is like call each other
sometimes like it must have been so much
harder oh this one says how do you
balance not feeling clingy while I'm not
growing distant from each other okay I
feel like I am like a clingy person like
I am just so emotional and like lovey so
for me I never want to be like
overbearing and over the top you know
like stop smothering me in love but you
definitely don't want to take your girl
yes and from each other so I think
there's a happy medium in between and
you can kind of feel how your partner's
like reacting to when you're like
speaking to them how they feel and the
last question I'm going to be answering
says do you feel like it has changed
your relationship at all and yeah
definitely I feel like your relationship
your boyfriend or girlfriend is like oh
he's gonna change through time sorry if
you can't tell right now I'm on my phone
because my camera battery just died and
I don't even know where the charger is I
just want to finish filming because it's
really late but yeah like I was saying
it definitely has changed our
relationship being away at college
because I feel like we've changed a lot
for my freshman year like experienced a
lot more and met so many new people you
know hopefully this video like made
sense because it's like I said before
literally so late I didn't even like
scratch the surface of all the
long-distance relationship questions so
I definitely probably missed some big
ones and if I left out any questions you
guys are like trying to no definitely
leave them in the comments below and
yeah thanks so much for watching I'll
see my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
