video about how youtubers make money
through YouTube and I'm running said to
them s video for you guys just because
it's been asked so much I thought I
would get some insight I've been on
YouTube for over three years now so I
think I have some good tips and tricks
for you guys and I'll just give you all
the down-low on the details of YouTube I
wrote down some bullet points just so I
don't forget to talk about anything so
basically you can make money through
YouTube through two different ways that
I know of at least the first way is by
being like a YouTube partner and the
second way is by like direct
sponsorships in sponsorships is
basically when companies will contact
you or I think you can kind of companies
I don't even know that till recently but
like if you're youtuber you can contact
companies too and like tell them why you
should be able to show their product on
your channel and they should pay you or
send you a product but a lot of times
companies will contact you if you have
like a certain amount of subscribers I
guess I would say companies started
contacting me maybe after a couple
thousand subscribers and I'll just email
you and say hey like we've found your
channel and we really think our company
kind of goes like what kind of content
you have like we'd love to send you them
things you can show on your channel if
you like so that would be like an
example if they didn't pay you and you
they could just send you stuff and you
could show if you wanted to sometimes
companies will say you should talk about
our app and we'll pay you money like
that so that's how you get money through
sponsorships through YouTube you can I
guess you can either contact companies
and they can like approve it or
companies will contact you and then you
can talk about their products like that
so another way you can do sponsorships
is if you use websites that will link
you with companies and one of them
specifically it's called famous famous
is just one of those websites that will
connect you with other companies and it
easily connects youtubers with all types
of brands like beauty and gaming and
tech like if there's a bunch of brands
on there and you can just like send in
your proposals to the brands and then if
they think that you're a good fit for
their brand they'll email you back
and you only need a thousand subscribers
to sign up for fame bit and start
setting proposals so that's good because
you can start even if you're kind of
just
and a thousand subscribers and it's
really nice to be able to use a platform
to talk to your companies because then
everything goes really smoothly and you
can like email back and forth and then
it make sure that you get feed when
you're supposed to that you uploaded
you're supposed to because if you just
email them like directly sometimes that
stuff can get kind of sketchy if they're
like not responding or you're not
responding like that so it's nice to
have like a website to do that through
but if I have is really just stick with
sponsorships and companies that fall in
line with what kind of content you want
and you already have on your channel I'm
not gonna promote something that I don't
think would be beneficial for you guys
or would relate to you at all and also I
want to talk about things I don't
personally like so if a company will
send me something and I'm like I would
never actually use this I'm not gonna
show it to you guys or even take that
sponsorship because I wouldn't recommend
things that I wouldn't want myself sorry
if you can hear and all these outside
there's like girls lacrosse I think
lying on the field right there but yeah
just be really honest and really careful
about sponsorships if you're using
partner you don't want like every video
to be sponsored nothing like that
because that can be really annoying you
want to be like true like yourself if
you're a YouTube partner you're just
basically getting paid for like views on
your videos I'm pretty sure that what
it's based off of I know it takes a new
account like a lot of things I'm pretty
sure like how many subscribers you have
like how many views you get maybe even
like your demographics like I'm not too
too sure about that but I know if you're
a YouTube partner you just get paid with
from your videos like putting up content
and usually you can start becoming a
partner once you have like a couple
thousand subscribers I would say I think
I became a YouTube partner I've applied
into the partnership program or maybe I
had like 3,000 subscribers and I got in
I'm like sometimes do I think they might
contact you so if you're a YouTube
partner you can be partnered like with
YouTube like through Google and that's
if you're not like a link to another
network on youtube so you can just be on
a Google Adsense kind of partner where
Google will pay you through Adsense
know what that is it's just like the way
they pay you but that's if you're not
with another YouTube channel so if you
are like a gamer or like a beauty guru
like me I guess I'm a beauty guru even
though I don't do that much Beauty I do
kind of more like fashion it's like
let's tile guys sometimes I have since
videos I'm gonna getting ready with me
video soon anyways so if you're a gamer
like a beauty guru or like different
like a different type of youtuber like
that all the times you can be partnered
with specific networks on YouTube and
network so I should be the one to pay
you look it'll go through YouTube
through them and then they pay you and
the reason you would be with the network
is kind of just like benefits from a
network like you might get invited to
parties like I'm personally part of with
stylehaul InStyle Hall is just like a
big beauty fashion network on YouTube
sometimes they have like parties and
like little events that you can go to if
you're invited which you would be if
you're a partner through their network
and you also might get some perks and
benefits like they might send you some
gifts or whatever if your partner
InStyle hall and I'm pretty sure that's
how all the other networks are - like if
you're partnered with them the reason
you do that is because they give you
some sort of benefit so yeah you can
either just be partnered with YouTube or
you can be partnered like through a
network on YouTube so that's basically
how youtubers make money through YouTube
I hope this is helpful thanks brah James</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
