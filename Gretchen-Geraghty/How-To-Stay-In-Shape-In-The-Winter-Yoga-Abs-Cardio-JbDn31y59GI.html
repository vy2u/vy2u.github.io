going to be how to stay in shape during
like the holiday season because I know
it can get really hard with all those
tempting tasty treats that like your
family will mate I know my mom makes
them killer like toffee fudge and pie
and all of that the Christmas of your
happy mashed potatoes and in general I
know it's really hard to stay in shape
maybe keep from gaining weight which I
know happens to everyone pretty much in
the winter being included it's hard to
when it's like raining and snowing
outside because you're not really
motivated and you can't workout outside
so you have to find other ways to stay
in shape inside unless you're one of
those people that loves running when
it's freezing cold not me I just thought
I would have some helpful tips and
tricks and show you just what I do I'm
just going to show you some course some
short little workouts some yoga that I
like doing because I like doing yoga a
lot and stay tuned for the end of this
video I will show you a nice little
healthy treat also I suggest getting in
as much cardio as you can here and there
just a little bit each day can be really
beneficial if it's running if it's
walking I know it's kind of cool in
Chile but maybe some people have
treadmills or you can just go on walks
that's good too I'm gonna show you
rowing on a rowing machine they're
actually really good you can burn a lot
of calories if you wrote properly for
like a long amount of time I'll do that
sometimes just to get some cardio in
some extra minutes I hope this video is
helpful and I really hope you enjoy so
first I'm just laying out my yoga mat to
work out on and if you're wondering all
my clothes are from this website called
electric yoga and I actually have a
discount code link down below in case
you're interested and I'll talk more
about my outfit later in this video
now I'm just stretching out and I think
stretching is so so so important that's
one of my favorite ones to stretch my
back my arms my legs and you'll see
throughout this video sometimes I'll
just stop what I'm doing just to stretch
out now most of the yoga moves I'm
showing you our based off of yoga moves
I've learned from the classes I take
mostly I will go to like hot yoga
classes and I'm like obsessed with them
so this one is just I'm kind of slowing
down to show you this one little AB kind
of workout you can do it's based off of
like downward dog and you can just have
one leg in the air and you kind of curve
your back and tuck your knee up to your
chin and it does look a really good job
at working your abs so that's just one
little thing I would show you and a lot
of times we'll just stop to stretch and
kind of like go into ragdoll and just
stretch out a little
this is pidgin which has got to be one
of my favorite yoga poses and different
people can go different like Jeff's and
how deep they can go with their arms
their legs and as you can see my left
leg is a lot more tight than my right
one and this is a pathetic attempt at me
doing my straight leg like standing
splits and once again my love leg is
like stronger than my others I'm just
like not as evenly flexible I guess and
this is really funny I'm like hitting my
head on the plan because I have enough
room but I'm just doing a bunch of like
downward dog and I do go into Cobra a
lot and you want to make sure that
you're having your feet on the mat and
not your knees and your thighs so you're
just kind of resting on your feet and
then going into Cobra help stretch out
your abs a lot and you can float back
it's like chaturanga arms if you want to
some more Cobra here I'm just stretching
at my sides and chair pose which is also
one of my favorites and then if you want
to be fancy you can bend down you're
gonna put your hands on the mat and then
you're gonna shatter onto your arms and
balance join these on top and if you're
really fancy you can like scissor them
out but I'm not that advanced then I did
some scholars another ab workout and I'm
again stretching out my abs with like a
bridge and then now I'm showing you some
bicycles which I heard are really good
at giving you six packs
tip tip and tip tip what am I even
saying okay now I'm doing some leg lifts
which are also like one of my favorite
ab workouts I love them and then those
are called penguins I think I don't know
you guys call them that - what we call
them penguins where you just reach for
your ankles those look like the sides
your abs really well
and I took some crunches and I perhaps
again and I went into Child's Pose which
is also one of my favorite so yeah and
now we'll just get into me showing you
smoking
so for all of you rowers out there
you've probably already know how to urgh
but for beginners I would just say make
sure that your arms are reaching all the
way out from the finish like over your
knees straight so that you don't hit
your knees with your arms once you're
hopping on a rowing machine
and I'll just take it nice and steady
for like some steady-state that's
probably the best way to get a nice long
cardio workout in so this is one healthy
treat which I know I showed him probably
three or four videos now but it's a
piece of like whole wheat like Trader
Joe's like bread so that's pretty good
it's toasted with some like all natural
peanut butter and some bananas it's
literally so good I can't get enough
like super feeling and really yummy but
it's a lot better than eating like
brownies and toffee and fudge so you can
just grab one of these when your family
is eating all those fattening things
it's so good guys oh and I feel like
I've talked about it in other kind of
like healthy food and fitness idea
videos before but Lucy and I like to eat
there's a lot of times when we come home
from school after a practice it's like
really filling but doesn't have like way
too many calories and it won't make you
feel like bad about yourself later it's
just some Greek yogurt and then some
honey bunches of oats with almonds and
it's like super filling and really yummy
and Lucy is just going to eat some right
now for her after school snack and yeah
what do you have to say about Italy oh
yeah this Greek yogurt literally tastes
so good look it doesn't even taste like
real Greek yogurt
it tastes like super yummy so when other
people are eating like pecan pie and
like toffee and stuff just whip out your
Greek yogurt and cereal and it will
taste just as good and also it's so
quick like literally you just put the
yogurt in the bowl and sprinkle some
cereal on top and I know it's more of
like a breakfast food but we eat it all
the time like it is three o'clock right
now and Lucy's eating her cereal and
yogurt you can also eat it like at night
sometimes we'll eat it as like a dessert
just like a little snack so yeah that's
my little healthy snack idea and I'm
sorry I know I might have showed it in
other videos before but I really want to
like stressed you how much we love it
and we just need it all the time and
is actually from this website called
electric yoga it's really cool they have
lots of yoga clothes that you can wear
to yoga class or you can just wear to
work out I do both whole outfits from
electric yoga so you should totally
check it out I'll have it linked all
down below and also there's a promo code
link down below that you can get 15% off
of everything off their website
yeah they've some really cool working
out stuff including these pants and this
is a Razorback shirt it's like dry fit
and it keeps you nice and dry when
you're working out as well if it's this
royal blue sports bra so if you're
interested in that yeah that was it for
my how to stay in shape during the
holiday month and I am looking at some
snow right now just remember to that
bikini season is always around the
corner and you can always beginning in
better shape just some motivation for
the day but thank you so much for
watching I hope you enjoyed and I will
see you in my next video
