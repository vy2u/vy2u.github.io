I'm so tired but it is like 9:30 right
now it is our last day here which is so
weird cuz we just got here like two
nights ago and yesterday was really the
car only like first of all day but we
were really here for like two up full
days you know just chillin and look at
the video look at that oh and I really
didn't film that much last night because
we were just had dinner at Rosemont
Stata blah blah whatever but now we're
about to go take some pictures and
videos on the beach in some bathing
suits like how cute is this one um so
I'm gonna do my makeup and I'm going to
show you guys how to look cute how to
look hot for spring break because I know
for a lot of you you saw bears from
bricks coming up or maybe some of you
already had them already but you just
want to show you because I know I've
gotten like for spring break sits here
she's outside but don't worry I'm like
literally not missing school like for
this I didn't miss school because I only
have class twice a week Monday Wednesday
and then I came here like Wednesday
through Saturday you know what I'm
saying like yeah I just wanted to show
you like how you could do your makeup if
you're gonna be like at the pool all day
with your friends but um you still want
to wear like some makeup so that used to
look like cute you know Thursday boys
are out whatever doesn't that matter
whose girls boys or whatever but you
just you know what I'm saying if you
just want to look like more than this
like more than just like no makeup you
don't mean
okay alrighty so luckily and I hotel
here we're staying at the Eden Roc by
the way it's like hotel no but it's like
okay next to oh yeah I mean if people
don't you make ones you know Rick in
Miami and it's me and Lucy and Mikey and
Emma and Maggie and I'm already went out
to the pool but since we're gonna take
pictures and stuff today I just thought
I'd put on so make it because I haven't
been wearing makeup and like the
pictures I've been taking before so okay
I'm back so you guys have seen I've used
these cutie little makeup sponges before
these are the blend baby maker sponges
are so cute from Daily Planet
I know Gigi baby you look at 25% off but
these little makeup sponges I'll have
down below therefore Fanny planets are
super great and yeah I know I've showed
them to you guys before the bill is
cruelty free and what I love the most
about them is that has like this
silicone applicator on this side and
then like this sponge on this side so
you put your makeup on on this side I'm
just using the CC cream I love it you
guys might always use that and then you
can like apply it like this and it
applies like really evenly like spread
it out okay and then what you do is you
wet all of this here things right here
to give them that just makes it more
like flawless coverage moving thing and
it kind of like expands a little Beauty
Blender and just like smoky makeup so
now that it's all wet and I actually
used to use the Beauty Blender makeup
sponge and then I realized it's like
literally the same as this like actually
the same in that one I noticed chokes up
so much of your makeup but I think
that's one more just like bucks out of
me whatever your reason doesn't really
like take it off so yeah I really enjoy
this I know this is like cheaper than
the Beauty Blender as well so yeah this
is gonna be really good for you know my
flawless finish as I'm taking pics on
the beach or the pool and normally
wouldn't wear makeup but okay there's
like it's like a spring break trip with
like your college or something so maybe
you want to wear makeup for pictures and
just being around your peers you know
then this is like what I would do um
especially because I was just in PV and
weird with a bunch of people that um
more on college ships like I know
there's much people from Rutgers there's
a bunch of people from NYU and they
would wear you know like makeup during
the day just because they be around
people with thinking all day like
whatever got this it matters that much
like you shouldn't care that much about
what other good thing about you you know
if you just look okay then I mean
under-eye concealer I wake you mind
really
like because I really like the bright
under eye look and I'm really freaking
tired right now also trying to make
probably me really tired staying pretty
late not gonna get skinny up at the top
because it's not really dead you're
putting on your a concealer if it's
right oh I'll find I like swiping I feel
like you're supposed to do more like
dabbing okie dokie so that's that I like
a little of you fluff ball my hair looks
like this after it goes in salt water
like in the ocean so it's just me really
fluffy today that's okay
spring break ladies okay so then I'm
just using this is a pretty much amazing
everyday basis except I'm not gonna
really do like I makeup since I'm going
to be at the pool the beach you know
just go down um made you some bronzer
and only wedding because I'm already
like the very bronze as you can tell but
since I just felt like makeup like
cheesy creamy to eyes I feel like it
took a little bit later than my body
right now so just kind of rolled it back
up you know I mean when I always wanted
a lot of a lot of wrong turns and I feel
like Lucy's like you cook you look brown
chunks on your skin but it's just how I
like it
ding-ding-ding-ding-ding okay actually
just started playing them in a little
bit the great is over this morning on
the indistinct so I felt like the ends
of them were the front too like very as
far as well not the best eyebrows they
just like don't really like the crevices
Lucy is the best eyebrows
I know there's no good I thought I
showed a picture of you get into someone
and they go she's the best night my
friend live okay okay so I know that
those are kind of like sick and crazy
guy like brush through them and then one
more make it'll be good well you know
what I just said I wasn't gonna die
makeup because you like be down my face
it's really I'd like to left me Jack
because I couldn't get them built filled
for like a month so they're just like
wasn't any all that so normally I would
just have eyelash extensions but
literally I don't have any left
so maybe I'll just put on mascara which
is so weird because I have more mascara
and forever but I just feel like my face
looks naked now yeah okay so I just what
I was tiny bit am i scary it's not that
much of a difference
and now I'm going to use some
highlighter it's correct
I'm just a little bit whoa it's like a
lot no no it's really good right and
then I do a little bit on
this is how you look hot for spring
break peep
that's so cute thank you
you just made me feel really confident
about saying my makeup looks good but
just a reminder that you don't need
make-up to make you beautiful ladies all
that matters food confidence on the
inside so you feel confident with no
makeup at all you do you girl you just
reminder you can use a cheesy baby for
25% off Ibiza link down below okay as
that lets me just took pictures out on
the balcony cuz it's so cute I just
wanted to show you like a spring break
outfit ideas so some things I want to
show you were like bathing suits because
I know some people go on spring breaks
where there's literally just look at the
polar beach all day with like all their
friends in their college and like a big
group and like literally the only thing
you where they hit entire to having
bathing suits so I think those are some
good outfits to show and then later on
for like dinner I'll show you other
outfit ideas like clothes that I brought
that you can wear in spring break so
this is the first bathing suit I have
and I think if you have high-waisted
bottoms it's really good because it's
especially if you're like you know
eating a lot during the day and you're
like gonna make me sit all day maybe
you'll feel more comfortable in like
highways the bottoms just because they
kind of like suck you in you know what
I'm saying and then this white top and
then this is just awful
but yeah it's awful is like my favorite
little bikinis they would probably be
good for spring break to you because
like a lot cheaper than nice like and
like really nice expensive one so yeah I
think it might be better to just go like
more affordable route because you're
just gonna be wearing them on spring
break and you're gonna need like a lot
for all the different days are there and
any who in case you like spill or mess
them up or whatever they're not like
expensive buttons so that's my you know
advice for bathing suits I'll show you
more em on magazines here actually all
wearing offi once thank you so I can
show you the ones that I put on them cuz
I brought so many of my favorite one so
they're little using my bathing suits
but yeah
no master oh wait just white underneath
like right underneath okay we're gonna
stop pointing that hard and let's walk
let's roll okay so I just took some
b-roll for them and I'd hope it came out
good hi yeah you can totally you some
