video that's actually been pretty highly
requested people are asking me how they
should start their YouTube channel or
just tips on like what you should know
before you start a YouTube channel and I
definitely wish I had watched one of
these videos before I started on YouTube
because there's a lot of things I feel
like I would have done differently if I
had known about I just thought this
video would be really helpful for you
guys and it's been requests a lot so I
hope you enjoy first off is make sure
that making a YouTube channel is what
you really want to do and it's for the
right reason so I just made it purely
because it was just fun for me and I
never even knew stuff that come for it
so that's what you want to do you want
to be making YouTube channel because
it's something that you want to do don't
make it because you're like oh I want to
get free clothes or I want to get paid
like don't do it for the wrong reasons
people can tell - if you're not like
truly invested in what you're talking
about and if you're not like energetic
also you have to make sure that you're
really committed you can't just put up a
video and expect to gain a following
you have to stay committed and just keep
going with it I remember when I first
started I would put up a video like
twice a week and I just kept putting up
videos so that's another thing you have
to be really consistent I would say and
definitely gets hard for people during
school so just make sure that you know
your schedule and what you can handle
another thing I want to talk about is
sponsorships I just want to say be very
careful of what you are putting on your
channel and what you're putting out to
your subscribers because you don't want
to take every sponsorship you get and I
wanna like make that very clear
especially in the beginning if you first
start getting emails from companies
you're like oh yeah I want to do this
but it's very obvious when youtubers
will make videos with sponsorships that
they really aren't that into or
sponsorships that don't even like go
with their channel you don't want to do
that because you just want to do ones
that you think your subscribers will be
interested in and ones that you truly
are interested in I just do sponsorships
that I'm like hey I really really like
this I think my subscribers are like
this too or things that I think that you
guys would be interested in I honestly
take one twentieth of all the
opportunities I'm offered because I only
want to do the ones that are really
suited for you guys and ones that I
truly like because if companies are
asking me to review products for them
that I know I'm not interested in you
guys won't like them either and there's
just no point and I'm gonna
I try to promote products that I don't
like so definitely be very honest with
what sponsorships you take and I always
am also with sponsorships there's
different companies that will like link
you with different products so I've
worked with like several different ones
one of them I want to mention to you
guys is actually called grapevine and if
you actively make youtube videos you can
click the link down below to sign up to
be a part of grapevine and it's
basically just a company that will link
you with different companies that you
can work with for a YouTube channel so
you can work with different brands and
stuff and they like help you out just
communicating and they're the ones that
will pay you for your sponsorships for
example I'm like working with them right
now for this one project that I don't
want to talk about yet until it's coming
out but I'm like super super super
excited about so there's different
projects and opportunities that can come
so I think grapevine is definitely one
of the good companies that I've worked
with I have like lots of good experience
with them
and they've helped connect new friends
that really work with my channel and
stuff that I'm really interested in and
like communicating with their team
members is always really easy and
everyone's so respectful and helps me
out with content that I want to put out
and also really timely it was like
getting you paid and everything like
that you just get paid through PayPal
usually for YouTube if you're getting
paid for things
PayPal is like the way to go it's just
super safe and easy that way another
thing with grapevine that's good is
there's no like strings attached no like
contract anything so that's good when
you're making YouTube channel you want
to be careful with what contracts you're
signing because they will have like a
handle on your YouTube channel
essentially so you really want to be
careful with that
so the good thing about grapevine is
it's just kind of like a company that
will help you work with different brands
but there's no extremes attached but
contract you're signing great by neurons
to see that you have a study audience so
make sure that you're posting like
consistently so I chose to work with
grapevine just because I looked into
what they had to offer and definitely
make sure you research up on things that
you're going to be a part of for your
YouTube channel because you want to make
sure you know what you're getting
yourself into so I definitely knew
our company cannot my YouTube channel
and the way that I wanted it to go and
yeah if you guys are making YouTube
videos and you want help like
sponsorships and stuff I think it's
definitely a good thing that can help
connect you with different brands so
it's called grapevine it's actually
grapevine logic calm and like I said
I'll have it linked down below so you
can just check that out that's just one
of the companies I've worked with that
I've had lots of good experience with so
I think it'd be helpful for you guys
that actually have YouTube channels and
I've been making youtube videos make
sure you have a good editing software
because you don't want a lot of ohms and
likes and butts like that's what I have
a lot of trouble with I'm always like um
like so I try to edit all those out for
you guys for me I just use iMovie still
and I know you can get better ones like
Final Cut Pro which I might actually
like invest in sometime soon but like
starting off iMovies probably perfectly
fine and I know there's like Windows
ones too if you have like a PC if you
have a MacBook I think they all come
with iMovie I think minded so that's
just what I used when you're starting a
YouTube channel you want to be really
comfortable with the fact that you have
one and I start believe this for a
little while I'm so nervous that I had
on the emember when I first started I
started my freshman year and I just told
my closest friends and I was like don't
tell anyone I seriously would die if
anyone found out that I was making
videos of myself on the internet but now
it's like I don't care at all and now
everyone knows my whole town knows the
whole school knows would just get
accustomed to the fact that if you're
making YouTube channel and you want to
keep making your videos then everyone's
gonna know about them everyone's gonna
find out and that was really scary for
me like oh my gosh like my whole school
could find out like what are they gonna
think of me and I was just so nervous
but now everyone calls me glv everyone
said Christian loves Beauty like hey
that's the girl that makes YouTube
videos which I guess is fine like that's
how people know me and I guess you just
have to be okay with that I'm okay with
it like I'm proud of the fact that I
make my youtube videos I just like
making them for fun and now it's grown
into like a job and a hobby and I'm so
thankful for that you're not gonna get a
million views on your first video unless
some people do which if you do it's
great for you on my first video I
remember I got the 10 views and I was so
happy I was like jumping up and down
because I made it to like the double
digits like I'm not even kidding you
guys and then
slowly but surely I guess more and more
people found my videos and I guess if
you're starting you could start off by
making videos that you know like people
look up so people can find your channel
start with a maybe room tour or
something I know a lot of people watch
those I think my first one was like uh
everyday makeup routine which was really
embarrassing
it's private now sorry you can't go
watch it um another tape I would suggest
is do not comment on other people's
videos saying like please subscribe to
me because that gets like really
annoying people that make the videos
might get upset and not like you if you
do that I mean I get a lot of those
comments on my videos like subscribe to
my channel check out my channel mostly I
just ignore them and I mean it doesn't
bother me too much but it is kind of
annoying people that are just like self
promoting them on your videos like
instead of commenting comments that they
should be commenting you know so I guess
it gets kind of annoying so I wouldn't
recommend doing that I would just
recommend putting up videos that you
think people will search up or just
uploading frequently people will find
your videos like it'll happen slowly but
surely that's what happened with me I
wouldn't worry too much about a number
of subscribers you have because it's
just about making videos and you being
happy you know what I mean another tip I
would suggest is I didn't know this and
you get around the number of subscribers
that you need to start being partnered
with like certain networks or I think
you can just be a YouTube partner
through a Google Adsense and you can do
that I've never done that I've just been
with different networks so definitely
know what you're getting yourself into
if you're signing a contract look I
didn't know this so my first two years
of YouTube I was actually stuck with his
company that really didn't do too much
for me I'm not gonna like say the name
but I was stuck with his network that I
really shouldn't have signed with and I
was with their network for two years and
it wasn't really worth it for me and it
was kind of a bad decision because right
as I hit like a thousand subscribers or
something else like oh I should be
partnered to them so I can start like
getting paid for my videos but it wasn't
really the best decision for me so
definitely know what you're getting
yourself into
and let's talk with your parents oh
that's something I didn't mention being
this if you want to make youtube videos
definitely talk to your parents about it
because that's something I did not do
for that something I definitely regret
so I started making YouTube videos
freshman year I made them into the
summertime and then it was just one
summer day and I walked up to my parents
and I was like I made a YouTube channel
I have a youtube channel
and I have a few hundred subscribers and
I didn't even tell you guys and they
were like what
you talking about Gretchen so definitely
tell your parents that you want to make
one and I would say ask permission like
my parents are pretty cool and they were
just kind of like why don't you tell us
but your parents might get mad if you
don't tell them that you're putting
yourself on the internet so definitely
ask your parents permission I would say
and like tell all your friends be really
open about it but this is just something
I want to do for fun and I like it
because the more okay you are with
people knowing like about your YouTube
channel that'll be okay with it too and
it's not that big a deal if I remember
being so scared and one day someone just
came by come you know right Gretchen
everyone knows that you had me too but
it was like everyone knows about your
channel and I was like are you kidding
me well I was like how do people know
but everyone knows so too it's actually
kind of annoying is people always ask me
how much money do get paid and I
couldn't even tell you exactly it's
really like complicated I don't even
know how you get paid I think it's just
based on like how many views you get but
I can't tell you like oh it's like $1
per every view I really don't know what
it's based on so I couldn't tell you
that and it's like a decent amount once
you start getting a bigger following and
everything and you get paid for your
videos every month it becomes sort of a
job which is really nice to have a job
that you love and I just love it so much
but I just like love you guys so much
like I love my subscribers and I love
meeting you and like interacting with
you on Twitter and Instagram and it's
the best thing ever I just came back
from Hilton Head South Carolina
yesterday and I actually met a girl
there and I couldn't believe it I met
her in restaurant her name is Corinne if
you're watching this right now create oh
my gosh but I just like love meeting you
guys so much actually met a subscriber
in the Bahamas too which was the best
Ryan I still remember you guys I
remember most of you that meet me
because you just all have seriously a
special spot in my heart and I just like
love reading the comics you guys leave
me I always tried like reply to them
because you're seriously the best and
you're the reason I love making my
YouTube videos so much I wouldn't do it
without such like a wonderful audience
and the things that you guys will it
message me and tweet at me and stuff I
just love putting up videos that you
guys like and that's why I'm putting it
this one because it's been asked so many
times if you're gonna make a youtube
channel be ready to interact with your
subscribers and just love it now for me
like my youtube life and my social life
are so intermixed YouTube becomes your
life like if you start making youtube
videos all the time it
your slaves your life there's not a day
that goes by that I don't talk about my
youtube-channel
you start this video I spend a lot of
just like blah blah blah I kind of have
lots of ideas that I'd like to share
with you so I guess the best advice I
can give you is number one is just be
yourself and have fun making YouTube
videos because at the end of the day it
matters what you think about your
YouTube videos you want people to see
you as your true self like you don't
wanna just be acting like someone else
definitely I always just act myself I'm
not gonna say anything that I don't
believe and I'm always really honest
with you guys I try to just always act
like myself like I'm not gonna act like
anyone else or endure something that I
don't believe in more than nitty gritty
make sure when you're making a youtube
channel this stuff is like obvious I
feel like you could find this in any
other how to start a YouTube channel
video obviously you want to have good
quality and good lighting
I know for me lighting is sometimes like
a hard thing because I don't have like
basic studio lights which I know other
youtubers have for me right now there's
a big window right there so what natural
lighting always works pretty well so I
like to use natural lighting whenever I
can you want to make sure you have a
good quality I use the Canon Rebel t3i I
know people have asked me before that's
like a pretty good camera but I didn't
have it for a while in the beginning I
did use my macbook I would say if you
could use a better camera than a macbook
you're probably good to go because I as
my macbook in the beginning and they're
like okay but you definitely want to use
like a better than that
the iPhone 6 actually I think takes
really good videos so if you could
figure out how to make videos with like
an iPhone 6 or an iPhone 5 that probably
would work out well oh and this case is
from Amazon you guys I know I've asked
me a lot but getting sidetracked did so
you definitely want to have good quality
after I use my macbook i use a sony
handycam those are pretty good and then
I finally invested in the Canon Rebel
t3i which I love it's my baby so
definitely if you are really serious
about making YouTube videos you want to
invest in a really good camera so I love
this one don't get caught up on the
number of subscribers that you see on
the screen like don't worry about it if
you're having fun making your YouTube
videos it doesn't matter wait I didn't
even mention this this is the last thing
I'll mention if you start making youtube
videos there's always gonna be people
that don't like your videos or people
who don't mean I have dealt with this a
lot like people will say mean things and
not even to me for me it's not really
problem if people won't come up to me
like you're weird make youtube videos
it's all behind your back
people can get like really catty and you
just hear rumors about what people say
or look you'll see text messages blah
blah blah people can get really mean
because people that don't watch or make
youtube videos don't really get it don't
really understand what it is and people
will always jump at the chance to make
fun of you to make themselves feel
better so if people are making fun of
you for making your YouTube videos try
not to let it get to you I really have a
problem with this and when I know people
don't like me I struggle with that a lot
and I try to do anything I can to make
them like me so that's something I
personally even struggle with but try to
let it bother you I know it's hard
when people are mean to you it makes you
sad and it makes you not want to do your
YouTube videos because people are making
fun of you but you just kind of gotta
push through it and be like it doesn't
matter other people think it makes me
happy and I'm gonna do it anyway I have
to remind myself that every day
don't worry about what other people
think it doesn't matter you're doing
YouTube for you and yourself and your
wonderful subscribers that is that and
YouTube will make you have like a
thicker skin if now what people say it
really doesn't bother me too much I've
gained way more confidence because when
people like say mean things I'm just
like you know what whatever don't want
to eat away at you it's not the end of
the world I used to get really sad I
would like cry at mean comments so be
nice if you're gonna comment on this
video because I'll read it and I'll be
sad if it's a mean comment but yeah just
try not to let it get to you too much
because there are people out there that
do love your videos and that want to see
the videos that you're making so people
that don't really just don't need to
watch you can focus their negative
attention elsewhere this is sounding
really cheesy but definitely just stick
with it and be yourself and if you are
liking the YouTube videos you're putting
out people will like them too sorry this
video has literally been so long and I
just can't shut up I just have lots of
words in my mouth and I wouldn't tell
you guys and if you have any questions
comments or concerns you can leave them
below and I'll answer because I don't
know if I addressed everything that I
wanted to and I know there's a lot of
things that you're kind of wondering
about when you first start a YouTube
channel but thank you so much for
watching and I will see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
