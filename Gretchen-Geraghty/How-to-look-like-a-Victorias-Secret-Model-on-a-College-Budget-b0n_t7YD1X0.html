look whenever I'm walking you're doing
that like I do this all the time
look at how foggy is about it's like the
worst mother ever today
Abby's menorah is still there that's so
cute we're in the library I feel like a
turtle you all right oh just having
finance it was really great let's show

where do you believe okay a student
information partner magical yeah yeah
you could look better let me get my
daily will out like you we want to come
loose Amir going Thursday well but Lucy
and I are hanging out it later called it
okay
so guys I'm about to show you something
that I've been wanting to do for song
I've had this like video idea for a
while I feel like it's kind of my
inspiration pretty much for like
whenever I put on makeup and try to get
ready because yeah Victoria's Secret
models they're not human they're like
mystical creatures that are like
beautiful my friend Alexis has this
beautiful light pink silk robe I'm
obsessed with this and now I want to get
this one too because silk robes are just
like my new favorite thing for when
you're getting ready you just feel like
literally Victoria Secret Angels let's
just go one step further let's say like
on a college budget because you
definitely can on a college budget like
I've just realized the margins on makeup
are just so high like these companies
with like luxury makeup or whatever
makes so much money and I feel like it's
it's not all the same but like makeup
from Sephora Mac whatever like maybe a
little bit nicer than the drugstore but
not that much better and like literally
I notice no difference when people are
using drugstore makeup or like really
expensive makeup so you can look like a
Victoria's Secret Angel on a college
budget let's get on to how I try to live
a Victoria's Secret Angel even though
I'm not a chef would put on it so grow
because you're just gonna feel instantly
like a Victoria's Secret model and you
don't need actually one from Victoria
Secret I saw a bunch of really cheap
ones on Amazon any silk robe will do
actually any row probably step two I'm
taking you over here to my favorite
mirror ever guys this is actually from
vanity planet
it's the gleam vanity mirror from vanity
planet if you can't tell this one is
seven times magnification which is so
good when I gotta pluck my eyebrows so I
always forget to do and then like a
month later I'm like why do you wanna
have a unibrow now I didn't know and
tell me but I love this because it's
just like the most perfect magnifying
mirror and I can have it like normal
like just to do my makeup or I can have
it like this like I said til I plug my
eyebrows they're like oh I really needed
a like light up mirror like this in my
dorm room to do my makeup because it
would get like so so crowded in my
bathroom with me and my three roommates
all doing our makeup at the same time in
the morning and I like to sit anyway and
like chill like listen to music while
I'm doing my makeup so I'm like I need a
good like lady up mirror so I was like
searching for one and I found this gleam
mirror from vanity planet it's literally
perfect guys and what I what I really
love is that there's like three
different light settings so you can have
like cool natural or
warm lighting and I think right now I
have it unworn just because that how I
like it and I know if you use the code
GG gleam you will get 50% off of this
gleam ear from Bannock planet which is
so awesome I also happen to know that it
is cruelty free which I know is
important to a lot of you and oh
actually another one my favorite parts
is that there's no cord you just put
your blade batteries in the bottom of
this puppy and it weights up and that
was just really important to me because
there's not that many bugs around here
so this is now this mirror link down
below don't forget to use GG gleam 50%
off that is all you will thank me later
when your makeup is looking bomb so now
since I'm feeling like Victoria Secret
Angel already I may take off my existing
makeup with some makeup like these like
mirrors are like to clear with the light
because you just see like every pore on
your face and you're like but I'm just
gonna be taking off everything I have on
gonna has been like super clear recently
so I literally haven't I've been wearing
much makeup look on a day-to-day basis
like I haven't been wearing much face
makeup but I'm like bronzer and whatever
and then I have like my eyelash
extensions is it okay with everyone if I
leave my eyebrows on though like that's
just how I do them anyway I just like
the ends of them are just like a little
sparse so I just fill them in and then
in the front so those are just gonna
stay how they are got to get my hair out
of the way okay so this is just kind of
the picture I am going for that I looked
up obviously Ken this is like a really a
flawless face she looks very bronze
goddess looking which kind of has like a
sparkly shimmery brown eye her lips just
look pretty nude and glossy so this is
going to be the inspiration I'm
literally using airbrush foundation
right now so hopefully that makes me
look like an angel that is the goal Pete
and like normally what I was saying I
got a day-to-day basis since my skin has
cleared up a lot and I don't really get
acne anymore I don't really wear a
foundation I just kind of really bronze
or powder or whatever I still have like
acne scarring and like discoloration
whatever that I'm just gonna try to be
covering up right now and I don't they
I'm gonna say the names of the products
I'm using just because I want this to be
really like general and just show you
like what I'm doing more than like what
I'm
if that makes sense because literally
like any foundation you can sign that's
like more medium to full coverage will
be perfect you know what I mean like it
doesn't mean could be the one that I
have and the one that I have actually
isn't drugstore so I don't to show that
because I'm trying to make this like
affordable for college whatever but I
just don't have any drugstore foundation
with me right now but some good ones I
can tell you really like that I used to
use that we're so good oh my god I
actually need to get it again the
covergirl three in one day all day one
that one was like amazing like whenever
I wear in high school people get what
are you wearing and then the Revlon
Colorstay is like really full coverage
like that is so flawless and I'm using a
really light like brightening concealer
right now like look at how light that is
on me which is definitely my preference
like some people don't like this light
of an under-eye but I just really do
what I'm gonna be doing lots of bronze
real later just like bronze up my face
like an angel so I am choosing to this
really light one and I really like the
look of just light under eyes I know
it's not for everyone I just really like
how it brightens up my face I'm doing
some foundation powder to look even more
flawless right now now that my new
bronzer I just want to say I recently
got into like contouring my nose which I
always kind of went like this with my
big bronzer brush I started using like a
smaller brush to like really sculpt out
my nose and I think it literally changes
the shape of it who's gonna be a
bronzing at my face right now to look
nice and glowy like an angel oh there we
go we can put you there at there the
Lighting's way better now I love bronzer
yes I do I love doing my forehead as
well I feel like you just look really
sunkissed and glowy and bronzed how many
times am I saying angel in this video
please let me know I start like here and
then I just like bring it down the side
of my nose see like that you know it's
kind of dramatic in a lot at first but
then you blend it down and it's like
totally fine and then I'm just gonna
kind of use this like rosy blush just
like lightly it's like shimmery and they
are literally so glowy probably should
have used a like liquid illuminizer but
I'm just gonna be using this powder one
and I go right along my cheekbones look
at that guy's oh yes and then on this
side I didn't learn until recently to
highlight
my nose but I just do the bottom right
there and I feel like it makes it look
so just cute and like a braid okay now
for eyeshadow I think it was just very
bronzy and shimmery and shiny I'm just
gonna go in with this like really
sparkly that was like just like the
color and canvas his eyes like come on
that was like the same I'm actually can
use my finger cuz I feel like that way
it's a lot more like pigmented oh yeah
look at that I'm like using a brush this
does like my new favorite trick just
using your finger to get the color on
the lid and then I just use like a
blending brush to do like my crease and
the action I think specifically I notice
heads fall out but I think if your eye
shadows follow it's actually okay and I
kind of like it when it falls down on my
cheeks because then I just look even
more shiny and shimmery you know now
that our eyelids are looking nice and
shiny I'm gonna use kind of this darker
shimmery color to darken it up and make
it look a little more smoky this opening
of the faces you make when you're doing
makeup now I just feel like my eyes are
very like bronzy and shimmery just like
how Victoria Secret Angels are I'm
actually notice they don't have to a
thick of eyeliner if any at all I think
they might have a very thin line but
since I have a eyelash extensions on
right now I think by my lash lines
already very dark and defined I don't
really need eyeliner with eyelash
extensions so I'm just gonna be using
this eyelash extension special mascara
that I got I got a weak lash by the way
emboss me if you guys have been or
haven't bending so get out so recommend
I give them to my Katherine she is such
a good job and all this does pretty much
it's like darkens up your eyelash
extensions and it has like serum in it
too that's good for them because you
can't really put normal mascara on your
eyes extensions or it can like ruin them
but this is actually good for them and
just makes them look a little bit darker
it's like chill mascara but for your
eyelash extensions we have just
relocated it to my bathroom and I am
heating up my curling wand right now
this is a thicker barrel because they
usually have a big bouncy like bombshell
loose curls so that's why I'm using this
this is just from nume I actually don't
think I would recommend it because this
is getting well maybe it's cuz it's so
old but um it's not working that well
anymore I'm gonna have to hold my hair
longer on the wand for to work because
it's getting so old and I think it
didn't used to be that way but anyway I
really can use any like big barrel wand
and if you
guys have any recommendations of good
big barrels it you have especially I
know Remington is actually so good those
are my first curling ones that I had and
they're super cheap from Target so they
definitely fit a college budget I use my
friends Remington one it's like pink I
would recommend that one because I use
that one one time and I need to go get
that right now because it's really good
put it anyway wait you guys are so low
down let me get you higher there we go
perfect so I feel like your hair I
didn't really notice apart it was just
kind of like free-flowing you know you
just kind of like flip it however you
want so I'm just going to start going
around my hair and doing like really big
curls well then it's exactly what I want
sometimes altogether it's gonna be nice
and loose I'm kind of like focusing on
the ends as well so what my hair looks
really long and it's just not like too
tight you know see I'm just going
through the rest of my hair wrapping it
around the barrel and then I hold the
curl at the end to kind of set it hold
it in place and I do all my curls away
from my face and shake it out and it
looks so good and loose now I'm just
getting my lip stuff I'm using this
Kylie lip kit in coke okay it's my
favorite and then I'm just using some
glossy a lip gloss on top to get super
glossy and I think it's like the perfect
Victoria's Secret so now I'm going to be
Lucy downstairs because we are going
into one of our like favorite people
ever milky chance they're so obsessed
with their music probably like a semi to
ago and I still love their music like a
cool down by the river
like look good stop you guys doing I'm
just my little outfit yeah
hi it's fine we're back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
