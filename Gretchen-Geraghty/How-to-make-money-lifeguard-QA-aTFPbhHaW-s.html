title of the video this video is just
all about how I make money and I'm just
going to be answering some of your
questions as well that I've gotten about
lifeguarding because a lot of the way I
do make money is through lifeguarding so
you guys just twitted me your questions
you don't follow me on twitter you
definitely should it's at GL v YT go
follow me so basically the reason I'm
filming this video is because I posted a
haul video recently and literally all
the cons were like how do you make so
much money like the top comment was like
this whole video was so expensive like
how do you afford all this Papapa and I
get money from like a lot of different
ways and I feel like I've mentioned it
in videos in the past but I thought I
would just mention them more in this
video it also includes some answers
about my job lifeguarding because I've
been like guarding for this is my fourth
summer now I really like it and I think
it's a really good job to have so first
I just want to mention if you guys don't
have a job there's actually some ways
you can get money that's really easy
like without actually having a job for
example I just wanted to tell you about
this site it's called opinion apples and
I've talked about them before but
basically you just take surveys and you
can get iTunes gift cards you can get
Amazon gift cards you can get cash just
by sharing your opinion and you can
click the link in the description box to
start earning money Thank You opinion
apples for sponsoring this video I
definitely would recommend something
like that if you don't have time for a
full on job but if you do have time for
a full job I guess I would consider
myself employed in like two different
respects so one of the ways I get money
is YouTube and I know I've talked about
making money on YouTube before if I find
that video I will have that link down
below as well because I think I have a
whole video explaining about how you
make money on YouTube with like
advertising and sponsorships and
everything so that goes a lot more
in-depth basically you can just make
money every month off your YouTube
videos if you get enough use on your
videos and I've been making videos for
over 4 years now that's just one of the
ways I'm able to afford all my clothing
because my parents don't buy for me I
buy it for myself and some of the
clothing I don't buy for myself because
I many guys were interested in haul
videos like how do you afford this like
I said before but so when the clothing
is sent to me from brand so that's
another reason to definitely over the
summer like a big part of the money that
I make comes from lifeguarding and like
I said this is my fourth summer
lifeguarding and just some background
before getting to guys's questions
I like guard
two different private pools which are
right down the street from my house they
are at an apartment complex and when I
say two different pools it's really just
one like apartment complex but there's
just one on one side of the street and
one on the other buzzers like so many
apartments so there's like two different
pools you know but I'm like employed by
the same people it's just some days you
work at one some days you work at the
other like I said I just have all your
questions so let's get on into them so
the first one is do you have to do
training and yes you do
I was actually fortunate enough that the
first time I was trained to be a
lifeguard was during my sophomore year
of high school and my high school
luckily offered lifeguarding as a gym
class so what's crazy is like we did the
entire lifeguarding course stretched
over my entire sophomore year for like
PE class so it's actually really good
because it was like really in-depth and
we would do practice saves like every
day you like swim under water with the
brick like everything we do everything
we practice it so much so I've got like
really comfortable with the idea like
CPR and saving someone and I think
that's really great if your high school
offers that as a gym class definitely do
that but if not I know there's like Red
Cross certification classes that we even
have to do like every two years anyway
to stay lifeguarding so I've done those
and the reason I said it's so crazy that
it stretched out over my full school
year is because when you get recertified
you can do it either and sometimes
there's like a full day like really long
one or you do it over the course of like
three days you can do it like really
quickly but you just have to know your
stuff so yes you do need training the
next question is what is training like
so I'm not trying to be mean if some of
you like aren't good at swimming but you
do have to be a consumer I think that's
pretty obvious if you want a lifeguard
for me that wasn't a problem I was on
the swim team in the past I swim
competitively so I was fully ready they
make you some I think it's about five
hundred yards and that's not too bad I
mean you can go like as slower as fast
as you want I mean probably not like
crawling but if you're not going really
fast they're not gonna get mad at you I
know you have to swim underwater and get
a brick that one's not too bad for me
honestly the hardest was deep water
Saves and deep water back boarding
that's just really tough and even the
most like experienced lifeguards have
trouble with deep water bag boarding
because that's just the most tricky and
usually if you're in a situation where
you would be doing deep water back
boarding unless you really have to do
deep water back boarding you and move
the victim to like shallow water because
that's a lot easier so you
like stand-up instead of trying to
struggle like staying afloat while
getting someone on a backboard other
than that the training isn't you rough
for me I would get really stressed when
we had to do like the time to say he's
good to do the deep water passive victim
and get them out and look at certain
amount of seconds but it's really not
that bad the next question is how old
were you when you started lifeguarding I
was 16 years old how long is the
training so like I said the first time I
got certified
it took me how long is a school year
like nine months but when you get
recertified you can do it in like a day
or a couple of days it's not bad does
training cost money or do you get it for
free yes it does cost money so through
the Red Cross I want to say it's between
like three hundred four hundred dollars
which I know sounds kind of like a lot
of money but I know for a lot of people
that makes sense because the job that
you'll have a lifeguarding will pay more
than minimum wage so you'll end up
making it all back anyway and what's
really nice is when Lucy and I worked
for the YMCA she actually still works
there right now - she works her butt off
she works a lot because she wants to
have spending money I don't work there
anymore but was really nice is that a
pool like that our aquatics director was
actually someone that could research
fire you through the Red Cross so they
would recertify us for free since for
your employees but now I have to pay to
get recertified do you ever get nervous
but a lot of people are swimming at once
yes I do
but I'm confident in that I know what I
would do if something went wrong you
know what I'm saying so I think it comes
with time - I remember night four
started lifeguard I was nervous like all
the time but I think you get more
comfortable with the idea like you have
Authority like it's going to be okay and
you know what to do if something goes
wrong so I think the best thing you can
do is just be confident and to have a
game plan because you really do know
what to do if you took the training so
be confident and I question is have you
ever had to save someone and I've
actually been it so lucky I've never had
to save someone and I'm lifeguarded for
like 40 years like I said I've like
guarded over the summer and I've like
guarded like here and there at the YMCA
and there's a lot more people that go to
the YMCA so I know people have to get
saved they're a lot more but at the
private pools that we work at over the
summer you know I've just saved people
that much because like if kids come they
come with their parents that watch them
like a hawk or people are just a lot
more careful and a lot less people come
so people don't need to get saved that
much except the other day my friend
Ethan just saved two people like right
as I left
it's crazy you never know but luckily I
am NOT the most I've had to do is like
just some first aid stuff you know like
bandages band-aids bee stings
stuff like that how did you get into
lifeguarding I remember my dad was
always a lifeguard when he was in high
school in college and he always told
Lucy me like guys it's a really good job
to have and it's a good feeling when you
know you're protecting people's lives so
he kind of got us into it and I really
do enjoy it have you ever had to perform
CPR on someone and no I have not luckily
have you ever jumped in thinking the kid
was drowning but it turns out they were
okay like I said no I've never had to
save someone but I feel like I'm
horrible like preventive lifeguard like
every lifeguard should do this but for
me like I think I know the signs if like
a little kid really shouldn't be in the
deep end so if they start making the
right of the deep end I like hey like
stay in the shallow end or if someone's
trying to like swim across the pool
really quick and barely makes it to the
other side and like listen buddy just
stay on the shell end of the rope I want
you to be safe and kids will listen so
also if kids are running I'm like don't
run like I hate when kids run because
I'm so scared that they're just gonna
fall and trip and skin their knees or
their toes or fall in their phaser so I
think a lot of the reason I haven't had
to do CPR saves or a lot of first date
is because if I see like the signs of
something bad about to happen like I
know and I will stop it right in its
tracks you know I feel like that just
comes with experience too you can like
see the signs of bad things starting to
happen
can you lifeguard even if you're tiny
and well I mean I guess it depends like
how tiny were talking but I'm not like
huge I remember in my life guarding
class in high school when we had to do
practices on like ever in our classic
everyday there was some bigger kids in
our class just some you know bigger guys
and I would have to save them and it
would take me a lot longer than it would
take like an average-sized human or like
a smaller like girl but I could still do
it so I would say yeah you can just make
sure you like a good swimmer also like
you have the tube and everything to help
you support people when you're saving
them so I guess it depends how a tiny
we're talking and during your training
in your practicing you'll be able to
tell the next question is what
qualifications do you have to meet and I
think at most places to be hired as a
lifeguard at least this is how it is
where I work you have to have your
lifeguarding certificate for the Red
Cross you also have to have your CPR AED
certificate
your CPR AED you have to get recertified
every single year because the Red Cross
likes to change the rules that they have
for CPR and 80 a lot and lifeguarding is
every two years you have to get
recertified
a lot of you guys have asked to I am
allowed to wear a bikini at the private
pools we work out because like I said
they're just like a private pool so our
bosses just make up the rules and they
do allow us to wear bikinis which i
think is really nice and I actually saw
a question in here that I don't know
where when I remembered someone said how
do people like tell you apart from other
people since you're wearing bikinis but
we have like a special lifeguard table
that all the tenants will check into
every day like they'll sign it they'll
show us our pool pad so we pretty much
know like everyone that comes now anyway
so they know us as lifeguards and we
like talk to people and we'll yell at
people for doing stuff wrong so we're
kind of like in a position of authority
and yeah everyone just knows really
cards have you ever had to clean up any
accident has there been any yep I had to
clean up threw up last summer and that's
that we're not talking about it anymore
but yeah that's it for this video if it
was helpful in some sort of way I know
people have been tweeting at me for a
while like make a lifeguard Q&amp;amp;A so yeah
I hope this gave you guys some ideas on
how you can make money if you are
looking for that and yeah thank you so
much for watching and I'll see my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
