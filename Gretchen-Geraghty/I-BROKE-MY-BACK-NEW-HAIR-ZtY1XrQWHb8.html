now
what's up guys so I decided I would vlog
today because today is week today's
Black Friday I keep it looking Saturday
since doing traffic look on Thanksgiving
but I got this at Black Friday yesterday
even though it was like late
Thanksgiving night because our mall was
open from school this vlogging camera I
got this a blogging camera it's so weird
it's cool to have one now though at Best
Buy
oh yeah saying our mall is open from 8
p.m. to 1 a.m. so we just went like late
Thanksgiving night and we might actually
go back today so I thought it would be
fun to bring you guys along and I'm also
getting my hair done so maybe that would
be cool to show to my dad and I are on
our way back home because we just went
to the doctor's and got x-rays because
my back is been hurting me from our
lighting and such and yeah c3 doctor
yeah we did this is so funny the only
thing I don't like about having the
Balkan camera now as I know this has
better quality than my phone so you can
see all my pimples on my face
oh my full of shoes everyone likes my
dad in vlogs and stuff from the wisdom
teeth video everyone's like your dad's
the best dad ever
yes he is really
I tried my new makeup guys with all the
makeup I showed you in the Sephora haul
video so what do you think what else
want to show them next yeah probably
getting my hair did
oh yeah okay before see how brown it is
at the top everyone Joe Brown cuz that's
my normal hair color yeah it's gonna be
blonde at the top but I actually am
planning on getting some lowlights too
because if you can tell it's like pretty
blonde but there is some around in there
but I just want it to be like a little
bit more Brown so it's not as blond and
also - dad did you know this if you get
more Brown in your hair when it grows in
I'm like when your roots are growing in
brown it's like less noticeable because
since your hair is more Brown
it kind of like blends oh you're getting
a bigger band
yep but also like I'm gonna get
highlights and lowlights so it'll be
like both it'll be a good mix hopefully
yeah hi pumpkin
morning princess we've said a million
biscuit and eggs and I think I might go
film like part one in my Black Friday
whole but I think we're actually gonna
stop by the mall later after get my hair
done so then I'll make more stuff so
then all the film that part later but I
just wanna like show the stuff that I
already got you know so I can like put
it away what are you guys up to today
when I pick my head I'm you gonna do
look at mania autofocus is like look
watch it'll focus on you isn't it crazy
the other DSLR camera doesn't even want
to focus on video this thing is wild I
love it
because these are now well the reason I
got this camera guys is because of Aspen
overed like turn Parker's walk they're
so cute
and she uses in camera I found out so
that's why I got this but this still
life right now no this is gonna just be
a vlog of like day after black well we
know it still is Black Friday Oh keep
going Nick it's not like Friday because
we went shopping ahead and actually
Thanksgiving but um I don't know this
would just be titled smells like getting
my new hair done I don't know new hair
new hair new phone who dis what are you
doing look at that my novel this is our
kitchen everyone a house tour just
kidding
guys want to see these cute posters that
are in a club to be back home made since
we're seniors aren't thank you they have
all these baby pictures of this my
parents hung them up in our kitchen
shoutout crystianna you're the best oh
oh I knew I wanted to ask you guys
something
wait actually if I ask you it'll be too
late by the time it goes up but
something I've been contemplating is you
guys know I cracked my phone screen if
you watch like a haul video where I
showed it in tweeted about it
so this I'm trying to figure out brand
new like success like rose gold foam
like that'd be really cute and like fun
in whatever that's to 60-ish like for me
it would be like 260 but then if I just
get my phone screen replaced at the
Apple store it's like 110 so I think at
that point it might be worth it to just
get success but I don't know what do you
think just get this really there's not
even
yeah I know just my phone replace
because the screen replace yeah and that
would be nice too because then I
wouldn't have like set up any phone and
all that like it we just open my phone
and I would just get the screen in place
you know and it's like makes like one
hundred and fifty dollars cheaper yeah I
just feel like if I'm spending so much
money it's like when I'm just get a new
phone but like I like can wait to like
decide or something yeah okay he's
covering her face okay see you later
xoxo look what I find why are you dying
Lucy that's the worst like to roll out
your butt
guys look what poor Lucy has to deal
with see this mark in the floor it's
because I moved her chair because I was
filming in her room this is actually
Lucy's room the old setup is what
everyone said in the video cuz like that
is all its setup I used to film like
christmas halls there yeah I did
yesterday from the Sephora haul anyone
up yesterday are you so proud of me you
zoom on this oh sweet
look at the camera it's like zooming
down your face cutie lewd fine oh yeah
tell them how much you ran yesterday
this girl's wild she ran for two hours
she almost did half a marathon she did
12 miles 12 and a half or but what even
you're crazy
Oh guys people have asked me in my vlogs
who Taylor is and Taylor's just like
ever yeah it's like a tribute oh there's
just like our best friend that goes to
be you with us and yeah she should be
more videos actually she'll probably
beat a poop turn of vlog miss this year
yeah she'll be with me vlogging I'm
gonna feel so uncomfortable vlogging at
BU but whatever yo I just filmed part 1
of my Black Friday haul and I'll film
the rest of it later after we go
shopping after my hair appointment and
that is the damage done and Lucy and
Manny were just chillin and watching me
film so that's cool
and yeah my hair right now even though I
kept saying that earlier but I'm
actually going okay why I love this new
camera this is so exciting like look
it's just gonna focus on my face how do
they know how to do that all right here
goes nothing guys I'm kind of excited
but also nervous I really hope she
doesn't want to cut my hair because I
don't want to cut it here your witness
this is how long it was before it's
literally almost to its old length like
before it went to my bellybutton and now
it's like a little past boob length and
it just really needs to be like
highlighted and maybe some lights too
but I really just don't want to get it
caught because yeah maybe she'll do like
a tiny trim but I'll be like Joe like
please don't cut it so yeah see after so
guys this is so exciting I literally
just love getting my hair done to like
hang out with gel like she stuff I'm in
so nice and I love her mmm but anyways I
love it I told everyone to go darker
with some boys I don't know if you can
tell but there's like it definitely some
more lights in there and I like it dark
underneath I don't know if you guys know
