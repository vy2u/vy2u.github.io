the ones I used to know good morning
everyone happy a vlogmas day oh my god
wait I can't believe it's vlogmas day
eight I was about to say seven but then
I was like wait wasn't seven yesterday
oh my goodness gracious
I can't believe it's vlogmas day eight
already Wow
okay we're almost done but just kidding
it goes till 25 so we're really not but
I just can't believe it look I feel like
I just started blogging yesterday look
at I remember vlogmas day one like it
was yesterday and this morning is a
great morning because I already worked
out and showered and I just got to study
all morning for my bio exam later it's
like our last exam for biology and like
I mentioned previously I'm not taking
biology next semester I'm gonna try to
go into business so I'm basically like
done with bio and chem after this
semester so my academic advisor is just
like you got to finish with a bang like
try your best so I gotta study all
morning for that I'm wearing makai
sweater right now I'm in such a good
mood because it just looked really comfy
and it was like on the ground and I was
like I just met cheddar I was like can I
please wear it and she's like go for it
and I was like yes so that's a good
roommates are for so you can wear each
others clothes I know she doesn't
usually watch my videos so hopefully
that she doesn't see this but I'm
planning on getting us like matching
scarves today for Christmas wouldn't
that just be so cute like roommate goals
so yeah I'm gonna try to pick us out
some cute scarves maybe I'll get like
flannel ones or something not flannel
like I'm what's called a plaid I just
had play-doh because a lot of times
swindles are plaid you feel um I feel
like there was just some questions I was
going to like address today that seemed
like they were like frequently mentioned
Oh
people were like can you please do like
a life update like first you're saying
you had to take down the video for a
personal reasons and then you're saying
you're like sad all day basically I'm
like don't worry about it it just has to
do with college like it's not me
interested in all of you really are you
and Justin broken up no we're not we're
still together I love him very much
yeah basically college just gets hard
sometimes so like that's that and
you know life moves on we're all good
there was like some different boys in my
last vlog mess or to vlog missus ago and
goes vlogmas day six yeah I showed some
of my guy friends and Walkmans day six
and everyone was like freaking out and
was like you and Justin broke up like no
you can have friends that are boys that
aren't your boyfriend so making that
clear I'm really excited right now
because I'm meeting like one of my
favorite breakfast ever and I feel like
half the time I just like eat in my room
even though the dining halls like right
there I still use my Dining Plan just
sometimes it's convenient or to eat here
post they don't have the same type of
yogurt and they don't have honey bunches
so when I want this yogurt honey bunches
cuz it's like the best ever I just make
it myself
I better go start studying for bio now
life talk in high school I really
enjoyed biology and I took it like my
freshman year and then I took ap biology
my senior year and I really enjoyed it I
thought it's so interesting and then now
here I'm realizing like taking it for
like the third time I just fit I'm
winning like the same stuff which like I
mean that makes sense because I took ap
bio last year but like it's just not
interesting to me anymore like I used to
think is really cool and now I'm like I
don't think I could handle this for the
next four years like my major previously
was biology and I thought that's what I
wanted to do and I thought I wanted to
go to dental school and it like hit me
like no I don't I don't want to do that
anymore it's like that's fine like
everyone changes her mind in college I
feel like so yeah we're gonna see how
business works out I'm gonna try that
next semester and yeah I'll keep you
guys updated with how my academics are
going and my little Mia from home loves
sending me questions for question of the
day the question of the day is what is
your favorite vacation spot and my
favorite vacation spot thus far is
probably Cancun Mexico I've been like to
Cancun Mexico I've been to like Bahamas
but I just like to Cancun like the best
I've been to like west palm beach and
stuff which I also love
but yeah Cancun Mexico is probably my
favorite just because I don't know I
just love it though the beaches are so
nice um the people are so nice like I
just love it however I'm leaving for a
rubra in 19 days with Justin in his
family and I can't wait I know that's me
so fun too so maybe that would be my new
favorite vacations
I guess we'll see because I'll be there
from December 27th to January 9th um I
plan on vlogging some days on there but
not like every day obviously because I'm
gonna like enjoy memories you know on
vacation without having to worry about
vlogging so leave me a comment down
below what is your favorite vacation
spot because I know some people don't
like the beach I'd rather go to like
Paris and go shopping or you know I'm
saying so yeah leave me comment down
below where is your favorite place for
vacation so everyone just finish getting
ready look at it's peanut I'm so upset
it says we had like a mountain of cereal
right there with the paper towels on top
and I picked up the paper towels and in
all this year I thought I left open my
honey bunches so they all fell out on
the ground and now I'm really upset and
yeah I will pull me and Taylor Taylor
Taylor bio exam where they killing that
was the hardest honestly out of all four
that was really the hardest but you know
what it's over but I is done class done
like literally everything about bio is
done Taylor no more homework assignments
or more labs
nothing I don't know what I'm gonna do
with all my time and we're second about

Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday
that oh wait it's like six days we have
six days to like study and explore
that'll be fun
the cupcake shop how about you I mean oh
you're asking me yeah I'm not gonna do
some I don't know I would have to like I
don't know what I don't know you know
that's I got that five exam was I don't
know what I don't know we could I feel
like go to the north end one day for
lunch yeah
I feel like I know Newberry like the
back of my hand at this point look I
need to stop going to Newberry because
that's all I do
I know when to explore we plan on going
to the Nutcracker that'll be a fun vlog
oh we should go to all those places on
my sign oh yeah actually and now I'm off
to a back dr. appointment throws my
chocolate milk oh wait is it literally
frozen probably why not just oh it'll
probably be nice and cold yeah
my favorite nice Taylor loves chocolate
milk that actually is probably so only
these little boxes I put another one in
there for you
in the freezer yeah oh my gosh I was
just gonna say like I think I normally
don't drink it but I would drink it
right now wow this is great guys these
chocolate milks are so good wait and
says it's really cool
I'm not weird about drinks like I
usually will only drink like water and
stuff when it's like really cold but
Gatorade I can only drink if it's like
really cold so this is gonna be tasty it
shall be
and I got it's like half frozen is it is
it good and also guys if you remember my
mishap from this morning when I spilled
my cereal all over the ground I don't
know did I explain it before I think so
but we have all these cereals here and
these paper towels rug up on top and I
was like reaching for a paper towel and
like the Cascade of cereal fell and look
at the ground I picked up as much as I
could but I gotta like get a vacuum and
vacuum it all up because there's still
like a mess on the ground and also I
wanted to mention earlier I tried out
this new eyeliner that I got I showed in
like my Sephora haul video and believe
it or not it's actually pencil eyeliner
and it's brown it's by Tarte I believe
and because usually I just use like the
Stila black um like stay all day like
liquid eyeliner or the Tarte one or the
Kat Von D one but today I was like I'm
gonna try this brown like pencil
eyeliner and see if I can make a line
like I do with a liquid eyeliner and it
actually works so well like I'm very
surprised so I liked it and I heard that
brown is supposed to look like more
natural but to me it almost looks the
same as black like I feel like it also
just looks very like dark I don't know
can you like tell a difference and I
just noticed my hair dried pretty
straight today like this is just it
natural and usually I guess I like sleep
on it um after I shower so that's why it
gets like bumpy but like okay I tried
like pretty straight and it's been
getting longer so yeah last time I got a
Donna we I saw this in like 4 million
different videos but I like would not
let my hairdresser cut it I was like it
needs to be long especially for when I
go to Aruba I don't know how to be short
and yeah I don't be late to my
appointment so I'm gonna go I'll see you
guys later today is been a good day I
feel like earlier we were in a bad mood
you're in such bad because of frickin
that bio exam but you know what
in the past moving on whoa and after
that I just found out some good news
vlog miss day 4 will be going back up
people they do I know everyone was like
where's blog miss a 4 I just had stuff
in there that shouldn't have been in
there I'll take it out and we'll go back
up yeah also in the past
and cute little tailor had cortisone
shots in her hip for all of you that are
curious do I wonder if they know your
story I don't know if we mentioned it
I'll give you a quick summary in 30
seconds
tailors for ACL when she went skiing on
December 26 last year and and then so
she got surgery on it she had to get
surgery twice on her ACL and then um she
was recovering it was Emil better in
likea Piaf good good and she was gonna
be able to like do our physical activity
again but then her hip started hurting
and she was like oh no and it turned out
that her frickin labrum had been torn
this whole time when she tore a CL but
she never knew because she just thought
that her hip hurt when her knee hurt can
you talk about unfortunate yeah but good
news is her labrum isn't torn that bad
and they're hoping like it's a slight
tear they're hoping that she can do it
PT in cortisone shot
hence cortisone shot sergers make it
better instead of surgery so yeah she
just has to rest because it hurts when
you first get them done but then it
feels better after we here so ya know
it's try to have a heaven you had
cortisone shots or like know about them
that would be interesting if any of you
guys have gotten this organ raised they
go through an ultrasound first so I
think I really don't see what Holly will
like John you and then it comes up on
the screen so they know where they want
to put it so you don't have any arteries
or anything uh yeah I wondered about I
wasn't I was crying and then I just like
stab you within you because I feel like
you're getting a shot in your arm look
at the doctor no because it's stronger
because it's like the dry needed like
hold it in there yeah it was in there
for probably like 45 seconds or
something and isolate that iana that's
gonna get your blood dried and you don't
just like sit in your arm and you like
take it out once they start to inject
more fluid into you it like worsens IVs
and you feel it going in I just felt the
pain I didn't feel like like we're so
angry I just felt the pain I'd be weird
if you could feel like spreading into
you or something and then at first you
like can't move really well they freeze
you first so they like put freeze spray
on you so you're no really so oh so you
can't feel the it going in it's like
novocaine except yeah holding
essentially and you're wide awake and
and afterwards you like sit up and let
the numbness wear off and you get up in
like on high here Lulu yeah Jesus no no
no I was a mile under at Taylor we
didn't Lucy everyone was like holy crap
how did you guys run ten eleven like
twelve miles whatever on my video really
couldn't believe it why and I will give
you guys a secret you just have to run
it like a comfortable pace where your
heart rates like you know like one 40s
one 50s because if you're like dying at
like a seven-minute mile pace for like
12 miles clearly that's why you're
hurting but you just gotta you know nice
and easy
