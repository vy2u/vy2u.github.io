since she's gone forever so I already
ate my own meal and now we have like two
hours till our next class and I'm just
gonna do some online chemistry because
who doesn't love that
am i right Alex yeah well no yeah
there's a stupid knowledge to finish
that yesterday really and then this
morning I met with my academic advisor
and which we call it
switched into the question business

little decorations guys look they
decorated just for you for vlogmas

silver and red I'm like there's a little
presents over there by the pizza oven

might get a piece of pizza because
that's just really cool we're in the
pretty dining hall up you guys this is
why I wanted to come here a member
because of all those cool like bubbles I
was like I want to go there because
that's cool yeah
this is about starting all if you guys
would it be or have been here I don't
feel as weird filming if it's like
filming you but if it's like holding it
to like myself free then I feel weird
and I should film you know
it's okay they can see day-in-the-life
but I get to look at all the time this
pretty face
Ketchum's going to get fresh cheese
pizza
how nice I got he's a big one oh what a
friend well that is so like yeah we wake
up Lions tomorrow morn it'll one but we
figure if we eat now then don't eat
later we'll be ok stretch that's the
question of the day

is what is your favorite material this
isn't even mine mine's probably cinnamon
toast crunch so now you like those very
thing I want Oh oops
all berries like the Cap'n Crunch ones
but all berries and I just wanted many
makes my own I guess my own hat many
weeds but then I put what's it all we're
witnessing the cutest thing ever right
now I'm just gonna leave that there
Oh
there's a poll on the way
Oh
kids can
that's so cute
oh I'm dying that was so cute Barbie
gun-woo here we are
so Taylor and I just got back from our
classes at 4:00 today and I'm actually
pretty happy right now because we got
our chemistry discussion and we got our
last exams back which is our last exam
before our final exam and I actually did
like way better than I thought I would
do and it's still like not really good
just because everyone here does really
bad in general chemistry third freshman
year but it was still like above the
average so I'm proud of myself the log
miss day too is uploading right now so
that's exciting I'm really gonna try to
get them up by 4 p.m. every day no
promises though like I said yesterday
it's going to be really hard and not
gonna lie I see it up to like 1:45
editing the vlog miss that's going up
right now last night so I'm really tired
and I think I'm going to take a nap
before I have my chemistry tutor later
PS I'm sorry I feel like I've looked so
rough in these first three vlog misses I
like I haven't been wearing any makeup
look I think I put on my scare today
good for you Gretchen and I'm wearing
like literally like I wear like leggings
every day and like a t-shirt in like ugg
boots and yeah I'm really sorry it's
just been like rough mornings and I'm
tired and I just put on comfy clothes so
probably not the me that you're used to
like seeing as much in like normal
videos and like after the week videos
and stuff but I'm going to try to start
wearing like normal human being clothes
in the few days again I just get into
these like ruts where I just wear like
workout clothes everyday I'm sure we all
get like that sometimes it's not just me
so I feel like last thing I said that I
was going to take a nap however I
showered and I didn't map and I've just
been doing homework and editing and
stuff there's a video I'm working on
right now this will go up maybe the same
days as vlog tomorrow I think this is
gonna go up tomorrow I'm Friday I'm also
doing some biology homework yay it's
weird to be like feel like I'm done with
biology and chemistry after like two
weeks when our finals are over since I'm
going into business now if you guys
watch my other blog missus you know I'm
talking about and I got myself a little
snack
you guys have watched my videos forever
you know thanks but guy over letting me
borrow your peanut butter you're the
best
I've never gets old guys never actually
it's funny I say that I feel like one
time I was eating man and peanut butter
and I had it for literally two week
straight and I was like you know what if
I didn't eat this fall I wouldn't be
that angry so one time I was feeling
little iffy but pretty much I'm obsessed
mmm here's my chem test that I got back
today and there is my grade right there
and I know it doesn't look too good a 65
really doesn't sound too good out of 100
but honestly in Gen chem 'days let me
see that 55 right there that's the
average so it's gonna be curved
who did you better than Gretchen most
people how many people today I got my
chem test back and I was so happy but my
65 and high school I probably wouldn't
ride but ivu it's really good that's why
I didn't tell my god I don't that snot
going in now what was in there me that's
not going in there you tooth oh no staff
goes did you get the average oh honey

audience not using you to better than 40
45 I did not do better than 40 oh boy oh
