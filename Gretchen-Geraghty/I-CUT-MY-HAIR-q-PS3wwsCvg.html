notice I cut my hair this is just gonna
be a really quick video and I just want
to tell you that I cut my hair and you
probably already know if you um
Paul me on Instagram or Twitter which
you totally should my Instagram is
Gretchen loves beauty and my Twitter is
at GLB YT and yeah so surprise surprise
I chopped up on my hair and I'm really
happy I did it because if you guys have
seen my videos before I'll put in some
pictures right here my hair was really
really long and it has been like my
whole life like literally since I was in
like second grade and I just like needed
a change it was really dead to look a
lot of you were like question your head
it's so damaged and it was like I'm not
gonna like the ends of it were really
dead but I cut off 13 inches so yeah if
you follow me on Instagram you would
have known that cuz I said bye-bye 13
inches like the caption so yeah it kind
of 13 inches in my hair and I can't
believe I did it like I've been thinking
about it for a while and then I just
went ahead and did it and right now my
hair is like natural so it's kind of
like straight but as you can see there's
like some like wave in it like a little
bit it's like it's kind of a little wavy
um when I completely straighten it like
in this picture right here it took a
little bit it's like a little bit longer
it's like what pins treat you know and
it's really weird like getting used to
it because I've just my hair was down to
my bellybutton before like I don't know
if you knew but here as you can see my
hair was down to my bellybutton
it's been like that for a really long
time I did it because I really just
wanted a change and I needed to get rid
of all the dead hair that was like
growing out way too long look he got
really thin like stringing at the end
cuz it was all dead um so now it is
pretty short I told her I wanted it like
here and she went a little bit shorter
but it's okay
and but if you can see the ends they're
really like soft now my hair is so soft
and like nice it just like ends it
doesn't get tapered down to nothing like
it did before
so yeah this video doesn't have really a
big point other than just to tell you
that I cut my hair so if you're
wondering why in those pictures and some
of you were like no like she's kidding
like no I actually did cut it and I know
there was some like negative comments on
Instagram like some of you were like wow
you do that like why did you ruin your
life perfectly long beautiful hair but
um I don't think I ruined it I just like
it needed to be cut and I just went for
it and got it all chopped off and I mean
sometimes like you kind of sad now like
regret it like the other day I cried
because I was like what is it why did I
do that like why did I cut off all my
hair but I really needed to do it and
there's really no going back now so
being sad about now isn't gonna do
anything like obviously my hair will
grow and it'll probably grow way faster
now that it's all cut um so yeah if you
have anything mean today please don't
comment it or just keep it to yourself
because I already get a little upset
because it is a very big change and I've
had long hair my entire life
so if you have any negative comments
please just keep it to yourself because
it makes it me kind of sad um but I mean
if you want to tell me that you like it
or if you have any thing nice to say go
ahead and say that but yeah so I'll just
putting in some pictures right here I
mean I like it and sometimes I get sad
sometimes I'm happy it's an emotional
thing like if you're a girl you know
your hair is like a big deal um yeah so
before my hair was like literally like
down here like it was 13 inches like a
full 13 inches yeah so I chopped up all
the hair and I think if you were
thinking about cutting your hair like
wanting to go shorter you should totally
just go for it because I did it and I'm
happy I did it now and if you watch my
Q&amp;amp;A you heard me saying that I was
thinking about it so a surprise surprise
I actually did it and I know I've been
bad with videos but I filmed my outfit
of the week this week so that will be
coming up in the next few days so I have
an alpha to be coming up and I also have
some other exciting videos I really want
to film for you guys and then this one
is just a throw in here really quick
like update update I chopped up all my
hair um but yeah so thank you so much
for watching and I will see you in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
