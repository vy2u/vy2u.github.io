compiler actually got ready this morning
I was very proud of myself I'm wearing
this animal can we name my best it looks
like a llama Lawrence Lawrence Lawrence
is a better name Lawrence the llama okay
I'm in order to actually made out of my
number even check the tag would be nice
it was like a pack or something yeah it
probably is I use slow Cesar meets
printer and I used like all the paper
and she got really mad at me I had a lab
there was nothing I could do no one can
even tell him falling except I'm talking
to myself
dan don't want me in their blog black
yellow Jeep mas blog with the B oh yeah
one do i BL Oh G happy bug at these look
yeah
I remember I drove by you at home I look
over in the car and you're like okay
everyone ready we need someone really
special very great yeah literally my
blog this is just showing like all these
people at BU okay what do you have to
say to my viewers smegging something
really inspirational oh my god there's
so many people what else can we tell
them I got some killer footage of Dan
Dale guys look you can go like this I
like how he wears this a hundred and
it's like a sylvie camera I'm isn't that
great
maybe you should just not go to my class
I'll just come with you guys great news
that is very true
Oh Taylor and I have both changed our
majors first after a first semester
freshman year I think it's the right
thing to do because they always need
actors totally I agree who doesn't eat
back you always eat him
just like you always need people in
business you always need a youtuber
thinking you always need me just kidding
can we look at how pretty this view is
right now like can we just I know I
showed it a million times and you can
see yet Taylor snow fit flakes and I
don't know if you can tell that says
Merry Christmas
yeah didn't you show cute work wait if
we go this right oh there you can
actually see it we're not supposed to
have them but Ari loves us so it's all
good you guys have seen stuff like a
million times now she's had a quite a
big feature on this channel have a
national cookie day it's a national
cookie day yeah that's my piece of
advice for today we better go get some
insomnia cookies then okay that's a good
one so guys a question of the day is I
said I wasn't putting them in the
beginning of vlogmas now this is
probably two or three minutes in but
whatever question of the day is what is
your favorite type of cookie and I
really like cookies and you guys know I
make those like peanut butter ones with
Hershey kisses all the freaking time but
my actual favorite is probably just a
plain ol chocolate chip cookie just the
original when they're warm and gooey and
they come out of the oven and they're
really warm I'll eat like ten of them
and you can like put them in milk yes
they're so good
like the peanut butter the peanut butter
with chocolate kisses are so good I feel
like I've eaten them so much and I'm
like sick of them now I'm not even
kidding meeting them so much oh okay
this is what I wanted to address I know
I talked two million times about my
phone and I cracked it and how sad I was
and I couldn't decide if I was just
going to get a 6s like the pink one or
not pink I keep saying pink and you guys
are yelling at me rose gold the rose
gold one eyebrows eating ice cream in
place but getting the screen replace it
was a lot cheaper and I only got this
like less than a year ago so I decided
to just get my screen replaced at Apple
and it was like maybe like $115 or
something and yeah I'm just happy and I
really appreciate the fact that there's
not big cracks in my screen now and I'm
wearing this zest today which was quite
the controversy when I was buying it
because I think my friends like Lucy and
Justin were like you're never gonna wear
that it's not that pretty it's kind of
weird it looks like an animal and I
don't know I just have been seeing
people wearing these furry vest and I
thought I was so cute so I got it at
American Eagle and I wore today and I
kind of felt a little weird in it like a
snowman but Taylor you've sawn me she
likes it so I like it oh my gosh I look
like you're wrong Taylor I look like
you're freaking wrong look I just blend
in oh my gosh today I'm gonna run so
I've been doing like running and
swimming and other types of workouts and
stuff also if you guys haven't noticed I
always like to just throw in a bunch of
my friends and people at bu in my vlogs
because like why not and you know it'll
be good that I did because I make you
like watch them next year and I look
back on it and be like oh I'm in mine we
had like camera Anderson yeah so yeah
I'm really happy I've been like putting
friends and stuff in here and you guys
know I'm making friends and aren't
worried that I'm just friends with
Taylor and Lucy so I just got back oh my
god - are you can fo I see the sweaty I
am I've just been running and I probably
honestly overdid it today I only did 120
minutes but like that was clearly so hot
I just feel like dead my legs feel like
jello like it's spaghetti you know what
I mean I tracked it on my what's it
called um a little polar watch Lucy and
I got these not too long ago and so it
tracks with your heartrate and stuff and
I did like some
harder runs within my run you know so I
did four by eight minutes at like heart
rate 180 plus and when your heart rate
is like 185 which I would get mine up to
like around like it was like 183 185
during those eight minutes I'd be
running so fast and I'd be like pouring
sweat like oh my gosh guys like 180 is a
lot okay
I'm gonna check I just forget how to do
this but I just want to see because it
tells you like how many calories you're
burned and like your heart rate like
during your workout so it's really cool
it says I went for two hours and 13
minutes Oh cuz I like probably walked
ready to look cool down after I burn 900
calories exactly nine zero zero so whew
and now I'm just gonna lay on the ground
no I'm gonna go shower oh and guess why
I think we're gonna go to a hockey game
tonight which is so exciting like you
guys know anything about bu my Boston
like hockey is so big here because we
don't even have a fall which is like
weird and I like realized when I was
coming here I was like wait there's not
even a football team but it's just
because hockey is like the big dealio
here and I've only been to like one game
I feel like so many people are like oh
my god like I can't believe you're not
going like all the hockey games and like
as a student if you have this sports
past thing you get like free tickets so
I really should have been going to more
but they're super fun and like the
student section is just crazy like
people have so much like energy and
support for our school so that'll be
really fun I look like a gross
disgusting mess so I'm going to go
shower now and I just I was following
the camera like this and reminds me of a
clip when Mandy was holding the camera
like this and all of you guys were like
oh my gosh what I scare does she use
like her eyelashes look so good and I
actually did her makeup for her that day
and so I just used the same mascara that
I use in myself
which is the L'Oreal telescopic in guys
seriously like I like don't have
eyelashes they're like non-existent but
they make my um
eyelashes a little more existent like
they like as you can see they're like
not long but this mascara makes them
like way longer than they normally are
so I am a fan oh my gosh wait I just
notice from looking in this can you see
right there my eye it's like all red I
think I like got a popped blood vessel
on my eye
something it's really scary I just
noticed it one morning like can one of
you tell me like what does that mean
like is that thingy gonna go away wait
let's see it'll if it'll focus again do
you see it and like the bottom right
there like what is that redness mean I
just wanted to go away kind of scares me
it's not very noticeable I don't think
but it's just a little scary okay I
gotta go shower because I always do this
are you guys like me to you where you
like I need a shower but you just like
sit around and find other things to do
and it's like three hours later and
you're all sweaty still and you're like
do I have to get in the shower and then
sometimes or even too lazy and you don't
even get in the shower you fall asleep
and then you just feel gross so I really
have to shower we just realized friends
that have the same sports bras together
stay together oh I forgot I had those
two white things I was like confused oh
and two black ones too hmm doesn't mind
like a cow Shepherd leopard a cheetah
and I'm prepared and Shepherd I'm gonna
show Taylors oh I love that one
okay guys these are seriously the
yummiest snacks ever inner Peas I like
love them so much they're just so yummy

crunchy and salty and delicious so these
are my new Lululemon leggings I thought
they were houndstooth you guys corrected
me they're herringbone and I love them I
thought I left them at home but then I
just checked my duffel bag I was like I
know they're not in here but I'll just
check just in case and I was really
upset that I left my home and I checked
my duffel bag and there they were in my
duffel bag oh I'm getting a pimple no

into things you can use in place of
