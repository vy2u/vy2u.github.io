look guys whatever really oh my god so
Gretchen actually has a crush on I got
no youtuber I'm really scared to show
you guys
okay we'll cut that out
good morning that's illegal
good morning I do not block last week
because I just bought my first day of
school and there's my toast burning away
Taylor minutes cry over this morning on
your ride oh that's okay sometimes you
just get caught up in the moment and you
just Rick you test my me gonna be a
great day my voice has always gone in
the morning but don't worry that it'll
come back and then we got do it - chia
seeds there oh that's not cute
no still not cute no no I'm leaving it
to go to class now where I actually have
a team meeting at 10:30 to 12:30 when
class starts and I don't even think I
want to bring my camera today I really
can't film and question that much anyway
and especially in class they even talked
about the first day we're like obviously
not allowed to film professor is talking
and classwork and stuff okay I'm gonna
see what Gretchen's reaction is when she
sees that I blogged but the camera is
sitting there and I thought this was a
prime opportunity hey I wonder what
Gretchen's are actually when he's an
iPod without telling her but I thought
this was the perfect opportunity to lie
because Gretchen loves just stupid
little strainer thing and she always
tells everyone how much she loves it but
it's most impractical thing that I've
ever seen in my entire life
so never you put anything it collapses
so it like isn't even I can't even show
you it's not even sturdy but I lost a
whole crate of peas to this stupid thing
and now they're all down the drain
because this isn't even I told scratch a
negative 3 out of 10 would recommend
that strainer anyway also Thomas rats
new album came out on Friday and if you
haven't listened to it I would highly
recommend it because it's so good hold
on I'll play you guys a good song
it's dope even if you don't like country
you can like this to look like something
also it's so nice out because practice
today and it's gonna be sick right long
Dave class just picked up some laundry
that I forgot to pick up yesterday no
laundry room got some packages stopped
by CVS got some iron pills cuz I'm kind
of anemic now been pretty productive and
I got so many compliments on this cute
little new romper from honey bun you'll
see in and out for the week and now I'm
just gonna do some homework and make
some food so I just cooked myself
something lunch dinner winner over here
because it's like 5:15 p.m. right now
and I have class around like 12 to 4
every day it's just like I don't really
have lunch all that much because you
can't eat in the classroom and I bring
like a little snack sometimes well I
don't know I really should start eating
like a meal or something at like 11:30
right before I go like kind of lunch
whenever get home I'm always like so
hungry so then I guess at you like
dinner like 5:15 which is so early but I
just made the yummiest thing ever let me
show you suppose it's kind of this
little like quinoa Bowl I heated up some
quinoa we already had made
I took some kale that Mayra mainly
actually got from the conformers market
I think and I cut it up and I put some
teriyaki sauce on it and I like steamed
it and then the peppers cut up steam
teriyaki sauce tofu sauteed teriyaki
sauce teriyaki sauce is the best stuff
ever and so it makes it all like taste
so good
and then I just had half of spectator in
the fridge as well so just heat it all
that up and look so that and then I just
grab some humus in case I want to eat
some of that with that so nice about
today but yeah as you guys know I
no longer vegan but I do try to stay
like plant-based so that is that for
that and oh I got to take my iron pills
now I just wanted to up to you guys I
just filmed a video that I was not
planning to film but I just thought I
got to get stuff off my chest
I don't know I just love being able to
share like all my thoughts and opinions
and things that I think are important on
my channel and I like it just to be my
platform where I can be really open with
you guys so that's what that was all
about so I just for that chapter now
it's like 10 Taylor's blow drying her
hair and we are going to be up late
tonight doing my part I'm already
falling behind which I cannot do in corn
so catching up hopefully I can drag
myself out of bed early enough to go to
yoga I'm sorry I didn't even bring this
with me like Udinese yeah oh now I get
it
not about how great it was the entire
time all right well it's stupid it's
like not practical so I'm not gonna use
it again I showed my friend Evan today
in class and we were laughing at what he
texted me about how does it look she
made corn yeah cuz all the P is fell
down the drain so I had to resort to my
next let's do this
Pease went down the drain and then the
corn and then the cord spilled over and
I look at ah so you have to fold the
strain in henan Duchin that doesn't make
sense you would take a pot and you go
like that yeah but what do you do with
the corn one that's in its trainer it
doesn't hold you go like this many
portable don't like the strain to go to
buddy you keep in the back thing in your

like I showed you guys when I was in in
New York City this summer it's just like
super nice to be able to have everything
like a man without looks super healthy
and obviously good for you then you're
like cooking real wholesome foods
instead of just like grabbing cereal or
cookies out of the cabinets because I
know when I'm hungry and I don't feel
like doing anything I will grab like the
most unhealthy like convenient things
yeah this is just me so nice and usually
they take so quick like 30 minutes and
everything's like prepared so that you
can just cook it up really quick so I'm
really excited and we got the vegetarian

a felony probably not so what else what
else isn't it
the bus is here we just made it which is
good good pasta yeah I have foot surgery
you guys want to donate to the
charitable cause gob trying to get on a
bus this is like the actual real me but
like normally I can't film that's key
what
I like saving other
vanalai sorry I'm so weird about like
vlogging in questrom it's just like I
feel super weird cuz obviously nobody
else is vlogging the only time I would
is if I'm like walking up to the third
floor to my class or like leaving like I
was with Sasha so maybe if I'm like with
Sasha all vlog because I feel more
comfortable if I'm with like somebody
else because they're with me I don't
know I'm just like that
but yeah what you didn't see my outfit
of the week if you watch it is that is
brown kind of spice colored jacket it's
blank and I see by the way I love it I'm
obsessed with it you know I'll just let
me down below case you're wondering I
think it so cute and actually Michael my
team was like I really liked your jacket
and I was like me so much because it's
like the first time I'm worn it like in
class and like I was just so excited for
it I think it's really Paul thank you so
yeah anyway oh yeah I didn't show my off
of the week because I wasn't wearing it
this morning but like our room for court
always is freezing cold like it's always
like a blizzard in there like it
everyone wears like long sleeves and are
so like I'm breathing so I wear long
sleeves and jackets or sweater or
something even if it's like really hot
outside because it's just super cold
narrowly but yeah I think I'm gonna like
make food because I don't really eat
much anymore because I just like bring
snacks to eat drink or since we have
like 12 to 4 classes you know and this
morning we had team meetings from like
10 so I just ate breakfast after Seoul
oh yeah the acai bowl before Evans class
by now it's at 4:47 but like getting
hungry again so oh my gosh I think I
still have a hello fresh I'm so exciting
I definitely do I know I made one
earlier in this vlog but I'm just gonna
make another one because it comes with
like three for me like cooking is like
kind of therapeutic like I'm just really
excited for it because I'm gonna like
turn on some music and just enjoy it you
know after like 4 hours of class and my
brain feels like fried you know so I'm
going to be making the sweet potato
steaks and these look so good I'm like
obsessed with sweet potatoes I got like
the veggie box which is awesome because
obviously if you're like vegetarian or
whatever you can still get hella fresh
and then this comes with feta cheese by
personal you just don't like buttah
cheese so then I just won't put it on
there
which is really nice because it just has
like all the ingredients and everything
here so whatever you do and don't want
you can use accordingly and what's cool
is like even though I got it delivered
like a couple days ago since it comes
like in the insulated box like for free
it can just go in the fridge after that
and then you can still use it over the
next couple of days so I know I've been
cooking dinner but I know they just
introduce breakfast options as well so
that's really cool you can go to hell
afresh calm and you can actually get $30
off of your first wake-up deliveries if
you use the code at Gretchen loves
beauty 30 when you sign up and subscribe
so yeah definitely check that out if
you're interested and let's get it on to
cookin and before we get started I had
to start playing some jams on my speaker
highly recommend self promo go check out
my fall 2017 a playlist on Spotify my
username is I'm gonna try scratching my
five ends I love putting together
playlist because I just put some my
favorite songs for the fall so if you're
interested in music I like check it out
but now we're gonna cook and I'm
actually take off this jacket because
I'm getting hot in here
all right so I just cut all this food
potatoes those are just the little ends
I cut off put them on this pan I just
put some olive oil over top I got to do
the seasoning preheating my oven things
are going great seasoning it done and
they are going in the oven
whew
silence that's playing right now is
really good but I'm about to toast my
hazelnuts in this pan whoa we just got
really steamy and the kale is now
toasting down there I didn't show you
now I'm going to be a slicing up the
mint while my hazelnuts are toasting oh
and I didn't even show you guys before I
marinated some raisins and shallots and
vinegar and I think some sugar to go on
top and then my bread crumbs were
toasting really quick so I just took
them off the heat cuz I think they're
pretty much done and now I just add the
hazelnuts to this with some salt and
pepper now it looks like the sweet
potatoes are done and the kale oh I'm so
excited
oh my gosh guys young you have to make
kale the way I made it because I was
just eating it playing with my fingers
because it was so good oh and don't
worry it can feel like way more than one
person so I'm leaving all the leftovers
for my roommates when they come home
who's gonna put some of this on top I
don't know if I chopped the hazelnuts
enough but you know what that's alright
okay let's be real so it looks so good I
threw some mint there can't forget just
sprinkle some mint on top and the stuff
I have to put on top too it's like the
reason shallot like kind of dressing you
know oatmeal and peanut butter and
banana and acai bowls are great but
something about like a real meal that
like your parents would cook on your
home feel like it's just really
important in college and people just
don't realize that I feel for you like I
understand most days I'm eatin like
carrots and hummus and butter and jelly
isn't just like oatmeal cereal stuff
that's like quick and easy but like if
you have the time so I cook like a real
meal like so worth it don't you just
feel better in full in the cooking's fun
and you feel like accomplished and I
don't know how fresh is just so awesome
because you can like focus on the
experience of cook even just like food
does that make sense
anyway I'm really excited to eat this
I'm excited for my roommates come home
and try it yeah and about how a freshman
or about how good this kale is why does
it taste so good
look I don't even know it's just really
really good who wouldn't make sure like
go to the tail did I even vlog yesterday
I've been so bad at this this week like
usually I'm not that bad at vlogging but
especially I guess just in this semester
being in core and like this sounds like
an excuse or like I'm complaining but I
don't mean like that at all but like
we're always working and I'm just really
busy just working on deliverables and
stuff David percentage of those was
really great I don't know if you can
tell I'm super tired I just remember to
vlog because I'm laying in bed I can
barely keep my eyes open my home editing
I might just take a nap oh yeah it's
Friday it's about 6 p.m. and it's so
pretty out because it just kind of like
led up on raining and luck I love when
this sunlight comes through the clouds
like that remember when I was little I
always would say it was God because just
like the beams of light I think it looks
so cool and then in my room and I was
just editing right here I look out the
window and there is a rainbow oh my god
can't even see it
well insert a picture that I just took
in me my story on my phone it's kind of
going away I don't know if you can see
but it's like right there you can like
barely see on camera but I swear in
person you can see it and it's so neat
feel bad that I've been so bad at
vlogging this week because like
yesterday I filmed with Arlen and that
would've been cool to get like a little
clip from but we filmed a Q&amp;amp;A that I
just don't like hanging out with Louise
in a be a bunch but I just forget to
like bring my camera with me and stuff
so I think I'm gonna try to keep up with
these like weekly vlogs but um hopefully
I'll like get better with them wait now
you can see it better again look you see
it now right
hey there is it focusing I think it's
focusing in the window I try to change
the exposure so you can see it I don't
know whatever it's really neat that hey
I read to mention ok editing my haul
video so yesterday before I filmed my
Q&amp;amp;A with Arlen I did something I made a
very big purchase and I wanted to bring
my blog camera with me but then I really
went running out the door I like 5:20
because I didn't realize that this store
closed at 6:00 on Newberry so I
literally was like rushing there and
like rush hour traffic and I got there
at 5:57 so thank God because I was so
scared that I wasn't gonna make it I'm
really scared to show you guys I got the
rainbow is so bright right now I haven t
on camera so I've been wanting both of
these rings for like a really long time
so I finally got them I just got the
Platinum that's on the bottom and the
gold on the top and they're just like
the skinny ones cuz I really like the
way they just look stacked like that and
then I have like a bunch of silver
jewelry on this hand and then like my
gold bracelet over there and then that's
a silver ring and so now I just really
like mixing up my different colors of
jewelry and different metals so I really
like the way that they look together
right there and I was like so scared to
show it in a youtube video but I didn't
want to like not address it you guys
just see em and like after the weeks or
like pictures or anything and be like
what the heck like since when did you
even have those and then like not talk
about it at all I don't know I just feel
like there's no good way to bring it up
but basically I just don't want people
to hate me and that's like why I don't
want to show them but I just figured I
just have to show them because or else
people are gonna be like what the heck
why didn't you tell us that you got them
early you know what I mean I don't know
so that's what I'm showing them but
you're weird about it because I know
because people can be really judgmental
about my videos and know it's like blah
blah question like don't care what
people think and I try not to care
people think but I also would never want
to do something I would intentionally
like I know makes you guys upset do you
know what I'm saying and like I know a
lot of times if I show stuff that's like
really expensive or like crazy or just
being like ridiculous like people get
like offended by that so I don't want
anyone to be offended about the same
time just know it's my money that I'm
spending and not yours not anyone else's
so don't let it thank to you and don't
worry about it but yeah I'm just really
excited though the steamy love rings
case you're wondering because I know a
lot of people have the thicker ones but
I knew I wanted two skinny ones stacked
like that so yeah
I just call it over to class because I'm
running late and yeah this is how I make
the beat it's gonna be a half of the
week toast
I'm mark and Megan Megan is playing a
game slash homework slash recruiting
coach we don't really know I gotta get a
job and it's based on this yum yum yum
