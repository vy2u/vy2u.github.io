gosh just four days till Christmas is
that real it is actually to 20 right now
me my mom and Tasha just ordered food on
overeats where Tasha and I went to that
American diner the other day we just
ordered like eggs and toast and potatoes
so good
was he just woke up so she's gonna
change right now so I won't right now me
so now we are finally starting our day
and leaving it is like 4:15 which is so
crazy but sometimes you just got it
somewhere else we've been sleeping in so
much here because we're so like jetlag
didn't throw it off by the time two
prints but whatever um it's right now
we're gonna go to this cool like a
lookout spot this shirt is soap and it's
real honey but by the way how cute I'm
so obsessive so we see starving so he
found a bruger's which is so random
because we have a burgers in our town
and I thought it was just like a New
York thing yeah my last day in Paris I'm
getting this with it they give you
bagels different here that's so funny
it's like well they always come cut in
half but like all wrapped up like here
they come in like a little tray mm-hmm
we went to wait Lulu what was it called
can you say it one more time because I
always say it wrong and I forget what
was a building we went to look at the
view but we didn't go
Montana's pretty nice mantra nice tower
and he didn't end up going because it's
like so cloudy and ready I don't know if
you can tell us we wouldn't see anything
anyway
so we just like explore down there a
little bit got bagels as you saw and now
we're coming back so the car because oh
hey guys here's my bag because I have to
put it in a white bag when you're on
this shop sleazy but I'll show you guys
later it's on my wrist right now but
it's like under my coat so I can't let
you what what Oh leans right down there
yeah we're the Halos many I got this
tearing last time I was here in
Thanksgiving and they didn't give me
like a tax refund form and that's like
a tax refund duplicate and obviously
this party runs like huge oh yeah so
that's basically the reason that I like
body here is because it ends up being
heck of a lot cheaper than in America
cause if you're not French citizen built
different taxes so then once I go to
airport tomorrow morning I get a big
huge tax refund we're just cool if you
like dahling attacks that means I'm
going to me right now oh I see it double
lights so we're sitting out front of
five guys right now actually eating some
french fries that we see god I know I
did enjoy my birthday forgot my coat oh
there we go
it wouldn't focus on it before but
here's the gold one it's just it's a
plain gold one with no diamonds or
anything and I also got it in a size 18
because I want it to be loose and could
likely move around you know because
there was I tried in the 17 at first but
like fit my arm perfectly and I feel
like you want it to be able to like move
and stuff I just think it's so cute and
she was saying also that you can like
sweating it showering substance just
like real gold that's like fine use like
maybe in the ocean don't go with it in
the ocean again this game is up cuz the
salt can like mess up thank you I just
think it's so cute and now it matches
these two little
card earrings I have the white gold and
the gold fragments on this and I hands
with soap Reggie my nails need to be
done horribly and then just the bracelet
on here I don't know I might move around
my jewelry because of this guy I'm not
sure in normally I wear my hair but his
bracelet on the same so I thought this
would go and my Tiffany one on this head
but I don't know I just thought it was
so cute and so Freddie Rick thank you so
much
it was so great chatting with you and we
love him guys right isn't he so nice he
gave us some champagne so he is so nice
it was like whenever you come back to
pay her come and I'll polish it for you
for like free it was just the best I
love him I don't know what meat to my
friend tries no Lucy we were just saying
it's funny were filming at this angle so
basically we just had dinner with her
mom and she was sitting there and with
you sitting here but my mom just left
her on it - yeah where's Leslie she's
linked to the grocery because our flight
leaves pretty early so she's gonna get
us some snacks I think so that we don't
start in the morning and we just ate
dinner of course and yeah there's
something really good a marine anything
I'm excited oh wait this would be really
cute okay so Lizzy was telling us during
dinner what she learned being abroad and
like one of her favorite parts and stuff
and I think you should tell them because
I think it's really interesting and you
said you were independent not like
reliable and things yeah yeah I mean
yeah so because you guys know like all
the trouble she went through with like
getting her things - yeah nephew murder
we just got a marina which they actually
have in Boston but it's really good here
- it's like a French thing they think
they're all over the place
and there's like one in Boston I got
vanilla I know Connell and I got
chocolate what'd you get strawberry
strawberry here
so I think the best way to conclude the
Paris logs is to say our favorite part
and those think I didn't sound like her
favorite part of being abroad was like
meeting so many people like learning
about the French culture and she's
changed so much as a person - you're so
different now you're so much more like
happy and fun my favorite part of being
here was just seeing all these things
I've like heard about so much
finally in real life like the museum's
were just awesome like home I'm not
really a museum person and I feel like a
lot of people aren't they're just kind
of whatever you know my stuff that's
like so famous and so like cool and
beautiful real life is just like I'm
saying like the Eiffel Tower we would
see like everyday you know walking
around going places but like something
about it just so I don't know cuz you
like to learn about it so much growing
up but then like actually seeing in
person you're just like what like that
was like the Mona Lisa yesterday we went
to the Louvre and then my favorite part
though that was a roundabout way to get
this answer was probably Pompidou that
Museum because there's just so much like
famous artwork and like it was just so
cool seeing a person like pictures
literally don't do anything here at
justice like seeing it in person is just
so different and like I didn't even
explain like the value of this
experience I don't know it was just
really awesome so yeah I was pretty much
with me like shopping and everything was
fun but I mean yeah oh my god everything
here is beautiful yeah you're so right
like way prettier than Boston or New
York I think and let me just like say
this is not true at all I heard a lot
before came here that people said Paris
was like dirty and people weren't nice
some people are really so much more rude
but it is clean it is not dirty
Amsterdam I really couldn't wash off the
streets every day oh and then cuz they
just wash it right in our town oh I'd be
like people I mean it's just it just
kind of depends early mean people that
would be nice people that's how it is
everywhere you know I think generally
people are kind of more like to
themselves like quiet but like yeah
whatever is open my buddies like New
York vibes like
kind of the same except things are a lot
more slow here I said when I got here
they're like what's the difference for
you and I was like Oh things are a lot
slower here and it was like and like I
don't know it was in like a class with
like everyone in my program they were
all like quiet like it's not slow here
and I was like yeah this is like faucet
in New York or like a rotten egg
probably feel like New York today and
they're like oh well I'm never like yeah
there was but no it's so fast-paced cuz
like I had like pre didn't professors
that were like no everything here so
fast I couldn't no yeah okay New York
Boston is quicker than Paris anyway oh
my arse my arms getting tired
thank you guys so much for watching
today's vlog I hope experiencing Paris
well this was really fun and we'll see
you tomorrow traveling home that'll be
quite an experience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
