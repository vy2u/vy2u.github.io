know what video I'm filming right now
but basically I just wanted to sit down
and chat with you guys for a little bit
I just got back from my day of classes
and maybe spent having a really good day
I just kind of wanted to share with you
guys my ideas and my thoughts and just
like update you on life so I know a lot
of you have been kind of worried about
me and I appreciate that so much and you
guys care so much about me and I just
feel so loved and especially after I put
in my video that I broke up with my
boyfriend Jeff saying after three years
because that was definitely really hard
but I basically just want to make this
video to be like I'm doing really good
I'm actually really okay and also I love
you guys so much that watch my videos I
can't even tell you and the reason I
just came and sat down right now and I'm
telling you is because I actually just
met a girl on IB if you're watching this
hey and yeah she goes to be you too
she's a freshman and I can't even tell
you guys how many people I've met that
go to beat you to whether the freshman
er they transferred like I'm just saying
that I'd like help them when they can
see me move in and they know to expect
and stuff like that makes me feel so
good and they love watching my videos
and it's so interesting since I got to
be you to like I just love you guys so
much and even if you don't go to BU but
literally I love you I just wanna let
you know right now like if you're
watching this I love you like let's be
best friends like I'm not kidding like I
was like I feel like working out we'll
be best friends now like me your
roommate her roommate is like from New
York I'm from I'm like this world is so
small like let's just all be friends
Ain truly if you're watching this here
subscribe to my channel you should be
the scribe no kidding but like literally
my subscribers like we're all just best
friends and also I was on helping this
girl she was interviewing me today for
her project her name is Gabby hey Cathy
if you're watching this let's move she's
from like where I'm from to whatever the
world is small like I said but we were
just talking on my youtube channel and
she was asking me questions about that
and I was like just talking about it
made me realize like just how close I
really feel with all of you and how I
feel like I don't really know if this is
true or not but maybe what sets me apart
from other youtubers in your head is
just that I try to be so open and so a
person with you guys cuz I feel just
like we're friends and I wanted to be
your friend or your bigger sister or
your your mom and sometimes is you know
what I mean like I just want to be like
there for you guys so like literally

much and literally like you're there for
me when I need you and like and I'm
there for you to like always tweet me
like message me here on YouTube like
it's hard for me to get back to all of
you but literally I will
I go through them like every day and I'm
gonna try my best to get back to you
guys so literally just know that I love
you and I'm doing really good right now
in my life like I'm very happy with
where I'm at and jerem sad over my
breakup and sure there's things that
aren't going right like I'm doing really
bad at my accounting class but like I
just want to say like life is okay and I
know I said this before but like
everything happens for a reason and I
get a lot of comments to you I should
just mention this now people say like
how do you say so positive and like
happy and stuff and like I don't know I
think a part of it is just like how I am
like I just generally make a pretty
happy like positive person but I just
try to live that way because it makes me
feel better and I think it makes people
around me feel better too instead of me
being negative and like all the time I
don't know if that helps but just know
that there's like so many reasons to be
happy and especially for me I just feel
so blessed and so lucky that I have so
many of you like I just feel so happy
so basically life update I'm doing good
I love you guys if you go to PU if
you're on campus and you see me you
better freaking say hi
cuz I've had people tweet me saying like
okay so huge in the dining hall but I
was too scared to say hi or see you
around a river literally I love you just
know that I love you and if I see you I
want to say hi and I want you best
friends so literally yes okay I know I'm
gonna keep meeting you guys I literally
meet you guys like every day and it
