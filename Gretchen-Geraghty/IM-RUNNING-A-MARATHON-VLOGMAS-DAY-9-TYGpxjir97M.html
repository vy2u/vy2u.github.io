just one thing is - its vv9 happy
vlogmas day 9 everyone and I can't
believe it's day 9 and today I'm
starting off the day strong with a mint
chocolate cookie mkhaya
gave me something for cookies and
they're so good and their mates give you
cookies guys I'm Taylor just made me
maple brown sugar oatmeal which is like
my favorite ever so yeah it's a good
morning and we barely ever make it to
the dining hall we don't give ourselves
enough time I knew it when you'd wake up
it would feel so much better right
oh my gosh yeah the court is entrusted
working what do you guys talk
yesterday's vlog myths we're talking
about it in so far I just did my face
makeup I don't even know if I have time
for my I mean cuz we gotta go catch the
bus guys today is Wednesday the 9th it's
my last day of college classes before my
finals start next week like I said I
only one final chemistry on Wednesday
so and have a lot of free time and maybe
I won't be as stressed like staying up
really late at night putting up blog -
cuz I can like sleep in later or
whatever I left my camera in my room of
course so this isn't my phone Judy Lu
eating her bagel like sister like sister
look how much meat butter I got woah
look how big this banana looks everyone
oh actually next to my head it doesn't
look that big but it did this big
and yeah
Simon reason of peanut butter they were
out of spoon and raisin bagels and I was
like excuse me
Shivam or cinnamon raisin bagels I think
it came from Tana
I think that's why I tried it likes
cinnamon raisin and peanut butter
because I never thought it would be good
together guys it's so good let me tell
you probably everyone already knows that
- us but today was my last day of
classes I'm done loom really easy
breakfast I must be starving this is
like my second lunch
it's 1204 things on my second lunch
all right so guys I just gave you
surprise Taylor I knew she'd be changing
and I kind of film but don't worry it
explains it so it won't go in here okay
do I wear cropped leggings of this or do
I wear running hmm I'm hoping my running
shorts okay yeah I'm going but what was
I gonna say oh yeah I thought this was a
cowl-neck but it's really more like a
turtleneck so I can't breathe but I
definitely won't put it in here cuz I'd
probably get into yeah don't worry guys
it's too explicit for your eyes I didn't
even vlog today really because I didn't
even bring my camera with me because
whenever I bring it with me I don't end
up fogging because I get tumors to
actually vlog but I always have been at
lunch I lunch with Lucy
I had to vlog with my phone but you know
whatever we're gonna be late I have to
actually get changed and go yep okay dog
miss um I don't know I have to shower
first
I'm not hungry my stomach hurts I know
I'm so tired I didn't belong that much
today everyone I apologized
um that me make sense I apologized I
sighs but I didn't vlog that bye guys
you so tired and I didn't work out
Sunday or Monday and I was just gonna
save my minutes you know and then today
I was like I'm gonna go for it and I did
a hundred and twenty minutes of running
and my thanks hurt so bad
that's really not smart don't do that
I've learned now I'm going to pace
myself and split up minutes instead of
doing them all in one day
cuz now I feel like dead however I do
want to do like a half marathon some day
and maybe even a full marathon like as I
get older if I keep training I know
26.2 is like a really really long way
however I feel like if I just keep
running as I go through my college life
and then after I think if I just like
keep training and training like you can
do it you can train for a marathon in
like six months real key here you know
so I guess that's the ultimate goal one
day I do want to do that probably in my
20s I would say I think that's probably
my peak of athleticism honestly I feel
like I could do a half marathon now
probably like today my goal was to get
to 12 miles I was sad I only got to like
eleven and a half but yeah like no
wonder my legs feel like jello because I
don't feel I could not working out for
two days like eleven half miles all at
once are you talk about your favorite no
finals I was like that's another thing I
knew vlogmas would go right through our
finals period which is not very ideal
however it's alright
I actually I feel like I said this so
many times but I only have a chem final
next week cuz all my other finals or
this week already
and so I'm basically almost done I just
really have to study for chem and finish
up some like rating portfolio type stuff
and yeah but what was even saying before
oh yeah definitely want to run a
marathon someday probably not very soon
probably like 20s oh yeah I'm okay I
just think about it like imagine when
we're like 25 and like probably do you
think you'll stay in California like you
think you'll move back to California and
like work there
or like be on the East Coast I know me
neither I have no idea okay let's just
say you're in California and I'm like in
New York or maybe we're both on the East
Coast and then you look look on
Instagram and it's like me running a
marathon and I'm like 25 or something
wouldn't that be crazy I think I want
like the justification of like I ran a
marathon but definitely I should do some
half marathons before that and see how
those go before I just jump into the
pool one maybe you're in the Boston
Marathon Monday except you need to be so
fast yeah I don't know if I'd be able to
handle that just because you have to be
so fast or you or you can donate like
large sums of money and then they'll let
you run it if you don't need a lot of
money yeah or if you're like I think if
you're like a part of a group or an
organization that's like a charity that
will like donate a lot of money then you
can like run for them so maybe but yeah
then I'd have to run more than one no no
that's gonna happen I'm probably gonna
finish up my homework and go to bed soon
and shower of course I'm so itchy
hydration is key everyone it's so good
it's called stay by go and my new
playlist is fire it's on my way to 2015
one and my user name is Gretchen Garrity
not very interesting I only have wait
let's check guys please just pick and
say I have more than Lucy but like
honest to god she does have a better
like what they called like taste of
songs
oh my god her playlists are actually
fire cuz Lucy just has a really good
like taste in music and
I don't know how to Tommy I just got
Spotify Premium again yesterday or today
or something oh there I am
who cares like literally thousands of
followers hers is Lucy Garrity in case
you're wondering probably all of you
like already know me at 553 come on
people help a girl out I just want to
say I have more than Lucy and my okay I
try my best
they're really not as good as Lucy's but
you know but stay is a good song I just
found it on Spotify the other day
because it was like a new release or
something so yeah at least that's a good
song in there my other ones and not so
much on Spotify don't you forget how
good carrots and hummus are like when
you don't eat them for a while like for
me at least I just like I don't know but
I don't eat them for a while I like
forgetting any they are but they're so
good this one got exiled so I um I put
this one on Exile Island over here
because maybe there's a pristine
survivor when I was younger watching my
family if they got like in trouble or
like lost a challenge they go on Exile
Island big carrots on Exile Island
because I don't know if you can tell
it's a kind of whitish so yeah yeah it
was like white so it was scaring me
because I think that means they're old
comment down below is that what that
means does that mean they're all know
carrots that I just made out dehydrated
or something aged ah no actually someone
told me someone told me it's better to
buy full like organic ones and cut them
up because I meant only baby carrots are
like actually people in like my videos
are like baby characters so bad for you
like their process and like cut up and
like really bad guys don't get too mad
like baby carrots are just easily
accessible at college so like don't get
mad and comment that those are all over
you cuz like there still cares okay you
guys just ruined my life yeah I don't
really remember my life last night Makai
I was telling all these famous people
names like their name change like Blake
Lively's name it wasn't actually Glick
Lively her last name was like something
else that was weird and changed it too
lively I didn't know this oh no you know
I Audrey Hepburn's last name was not
Hepburn
all right do you think Beyonce's name is
really Beyonce yes yeah she was just
telling me all these people who like
it's different oh this is manual focus
why does it do that and then it doesn't
autofocus is Beyonce's named Beyonce I
don't think so
it's Beyonce Knowles yeah that's her
first name like Rihanna's name Rihanna
is just her middle name is my crazy
Justin Bieber's Justin Bieber yeah
Taylor Swift is just T Swift oh oh I
thought you meant her first name was T
that's top secret
I don't think you guys know my middle
name or say she told me yeah she's a
different one or something none of you
will ever know my middle name now
they're gonna go crazy in the comment
section is it what is it you know what
if this video gets enough thumbs up then
I'll say it in the next one how many do
you think is reasonable 10,000 not that
I need people even watch vlogmas
thousand subscribers I don't think I get
10,000 I think the max I get is like one
or two thousand so I would say if this
gets to five thousand thumbs ups
mark my words guys in my next video I'll
say my middle name I almost just said it
just now but like literally it's a
mystery and I don't like telling people
like I'm fine with it like I'm proud of
it I like it it's like in my family but
it's just very different so I'd rather
not just deal with people being like oh
my gosh I'm so near an endeavor and well
you know but five thousand thumbs up and
I'll say it in vlogmas day whatever a
thumbs up multiple times no no so get
your friends to thumbs it up if you want
to know my middle name
someone commented that it soul says
November I know I've just given up on
the calendar I thought it was a great
idea but I just can't be bothered to
keep up with it so thought is that oh my
