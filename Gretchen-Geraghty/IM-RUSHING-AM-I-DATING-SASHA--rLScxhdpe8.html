then my Twitter is just at GL DYP and
I've been getting really into recently I
just been having lots of fun tweeting
away I want to say your guys's names to
you this time because I've got really
fun Aaron Pigman says do you ever
consider going back to your own hair and
honestly Aaron no because I did that my
freshman year of high school and
everyone called me Lucy I just realized
I meant to be blonde is way more me
Tracy
Rosen which so take Russian would you be
able to make a video on how you're
preparing for you half marathon and can
you living your videos hey love you
Tracy I don't really know how to be
preparing for my half marathon I can't
on every day because I did that last
fall and I killed my shins I be
worshipped in separate like I could you
guys not I would run between like 10 or
12 miles everyday which sounds so crazy
now but yeah I was in really good shape
but my body was blowing apart so I try
to run not 10 or 12 miles six times a
week and now I just do smaller distances
I would say three or four times a week
Kevin joining excessive brows on fleek
flow because Sarah sunny says how can
you afford all these expensive high-end
products so I get this question a lot
get worried about showing you guys
especially just expensive because I'm
worried about like criticisms but how I
afford the things that I want in college
and all the expenses of my life it's
really just YouTube I'm so blessed and
so lucky that it is grown into something
that I'm able to support myself with so
I also get the question a lot of
Gretchen look I don't have time for a
job I'm in school like how can I make
some money so I can afford to get the
things I want it is one easy way that I
know of is this website called Opinion
Outpost
you just have it surveys on there that
you guys can take to get Amazon gift
cards iTunes gift cards and just cash as
well so I think that's a really good
option for a lot of you that don't have
time for a job call that link down below
in the description box you guys can
start doing surveys today and start
making money and make you somewhat
depending that close before it's
sponsoring this video
Bailey Amma says what made you decide to
rush this spring so is this go so weird
for me they even like talking about it
because I feel like I've only decided
like so recently is that I'm going to
I did mention in a video or two now you
guys know that I wrote D one on the
lightweight women's rowing team my
freshman year last year at Boston
University and I stopped rowing this
fall so I was almost worried that I
would have too much free time but that
was not the case at all I was so busy
with classes and really any free time I
had I just filled up with you too but I
just figured it'd be good for me to
branch out and make some more friends
that are only athletes because now I'm
pretty much only friends like rowers
which I love cuz those are all the girls
on my team you know and I'm still
friends with them but I just think it'd
be good for me to look branch out and it
makes sense as people that aren't
athletes myarray cherry says are you
going to blog your trip to Africa and I
haven't really thought about it that
much I don't know how able I will be to
log while I will be climbing this huge
mountain but I think that can be amazing
unique was my time experience so I will
try my best blog and I Sasha will be
really into filming so there we banded
Adi said if you could travel to one
place in the world right now without
having to worry about paying for it
where would you go that's so typical but
really the answer would be the same even
if I was paying for it and it would just
be the beads like somewhere warm like in
the Bahamas or like a tropical island
like Tahiti Morgan doling so how did you
know be used the college for you and
really if I said oh back to senior year
I would have changed a lot on my college
search I was so like tunnel vision just
on a school that had competitive
lightweight rowing because that's really
all that I wanted in a college but I
mean I didn't know anything else like my
senior year of high school that's just
really what I wanted so literally the
only reason I went to bu is because I
was recruited for lightweight rowing and
I didn't apply to any other colleges one
fact that's really like the only reason
I went there I mean also I knew what I
wanted to go to school in the city cuz
I'm such like a city person so funny
that I'm not rolling anymore but luckily
I still love bu even our own Jamie
McNutt said it did your bellybutton
piercing hurt and do you recommend money
and my really one piercing it didn't
hurt at all like I was so nervous I was
like freaking out and she's like okay
it's done and I was like what look at
little lead in hers off of you want one
go for it look I definitely would
recommend it to mine
mattie Lewis 15 says can Lucy do a hair
care routine and actually and she did
one this summer on our vlog Channel so
do not subscribe to our blog channel
I'll also have that link down below
definitely go subscribe it's just
congrats and Lucy and I post lots in
there all the time well see and I would
do them together over the summer and we
did vlogmas together but back at school
she's still growing and she needs to
like focus on that on academic she does
really have time to be vlogging though
during the school year is pretty much
just mine but sometimes she'll be a part
of it too
that's why it's called Gretchen and Lucy
Delaney grace oh she asked two questions
she said are you going to be when I'm
seated lemon collection I don't know I
like just did it must have been about a
year ago but yeah I don't know I haven't
gotten that much new stuff I mean some
stuff and I've gotten rid of some stuff
so it might be helpful for you guys
thumbs up this video if you want to see
enough to do the blooming collection so
I can see how many of you you want to
see one she also said are you becoming
yoga instructor so I know I talked about
this in videos tests and I'm so
interested in becoming a yoga instructor
because it just seems so interesting to
me and my yoga instructor like
recommended that I should Lawson she's
like the best I love her so I was like
so gung-ho about it like right as I
heard about it but it is like extremely
expensive to get your 200 hour yoga
certification in license so that's like
one thing I've to take into
consideration and also it's 200 hours
it's like very like time intensive I
think it's over eight weeks and I just
don't know if I can commit to that right
now for the spring because like I said
I'm going to be rushing and still having
my full 18 credit coursework you know
what I mean but I still might end up
doing it this spring I just kind of have
to look at like how busy I am and see if
I could handle it so I can't really
commit to it like right now so if I
don't do it this spring I will probably
do in the future
Natasha P says do you miss swimming at
all or regret quitting so I don't regret
quitting because Lucy and I were at a
very busy play our life we just quit
basketball we are still doing volleyball
swimming and rowing and so obviously
still three sports at once was like a
lot like eighth grade was so wild we did
four sports we literally did back to all
rowing volleyball swimming so I don't
know how I lived in ninth grade we
decided to stop with alcohol we also
stopped swimming I think at the end or
beginning of ninth grade I don't worry
about quitting just because we had to
focus on rowing I do miss a and I think
it's such a good workout you guys know
if you watch our blogs it looks now
we're just coming the other day and I
feel like it's something that you don't
really lose like if any of these are
swimmers look I really didn't swim in so
long I just hop back in the pool and I
just started swimming again and could
swim an hour straight feel like I didn't
lose any speed at all like I just picked
it right back up so that's really fun
Kylie - Gus says the UN was he ever
fight love you guys
yeah we fight all the time but she's
doing this friends and I over Morgan are
w18 says what I often see you wear and I
get this question all the time and I
don't know why I didn't said it I said
it maybe a couple times some user like
the illumines of ever worn just because
I literally just started wearing them
like a month ago and I saw some other
youtuber recommend them and I don't even
know if they sell them like in the store
at all anymore so I just like order them
online in like bolt like I think I
ordered like 10 packs so these eyelashes
are called the kiss ever easy lashes and
if I can find a link to them I might
leave them down below I don't even know
if I can find a link no promises just
google it and I'm sure you can buy them
like all over the Internet
shell dot y so Shelley maybe so you
probably won't answer this but it's
worth a shot
I'm answering your question girl I got
you she said did you ever have braces
and what was it like I might be getting
briefs too soon I'm a little nervous
I don't be nervous it's okay it's going
to be worth it because she took anyway
straighter afternoon to be happy
see I I did have races of the answer to
the question I had them for four years
guys I had them from sixth grade all the
way through tenth grade which was a wild
totally worth it because my teeth are
very stratum oh she also asked what is
your favorite often table place and
where is it located has to be in
Manhattan Beach in LA so obviously not
very convenient because I'm on the East
Coast but I called Paradise Falls and
they have the chocolate peanut butter
acai bowl and it's so good Liz Westbrook
says what is your favorite part of
college and comparison to high school so
it definitely does the independence of
living not at home like living at
college and just having to worry about
yourself and being able to like be
selfish type like the best part like you
don't have to collaborate with your
family on like dinner plans and like
always like let your parents know where
you are and where you're going what
you're doing you literally can just like
do things for yourself obviously you'll
be accountable like a little bit to your
friends like you'll want to hang out
with them and make dinner plans with
them but it's like a lot more
and in high school guy Kendrick says
sorry but I have to ask you think you
and Tasha my ever date why do I love
your videos and have done bears you are
I'll love you Scott and no we're never
going to date we're like really good
friends but you actually is a girlfriend
right now and you guys are always like
oh my god you guys are gonna date and
like no we're not going to date so
though hiawatha if you're watching this
you're not watching this but along with
his girlfriend and i love our she's with
us Heather Nash Shen says do you like
being a twin yes I love being a family
my best friend ever and if he didn't go
to be with me I don't know what I would
do
Keeley Schwartz says have you had any
other serious boyfriends beside Justin
and no I have not Tara Marie says what
is the farthest you have ever run in one
run and honestly it was probably I would
do this run a lot last fall to keep up
with minutes or rolling so I'd work out
a bunch this sounds so crazy now because
I would never do it now but a lot of the
times last fall like one practice would
be like 120 minutes so I was injured
with my back so I literally look run 400
20 minutes out of D 60 minutes on the
treadmill actually I was get off and
stretch them into another 60 minutes but
the longest run I have done in one run
was with Lucy last winter when we came
home over break we also had to obviously
keep in shape for like rolling in the
spring and one day I went on one of her
crazy runs with your honor with you guys
no but she was so into long-distance
running
last winter she got like so skinny and
literally would eat like over 3,000
calories everyday and was just so thin
and so in shape because she ran like
literally two hours every day one day I
was like okay I'm going to go on one of
your crazy runs with you and I literally
was so sore for a week and like couldn't
walk yeah we did like 120 minutes so
it's two hours and we were probably
right around a half marathon and
distance so 13.1 miles is probably right
around that but I'm not even in that
kind of running shape right now for my
half marathon this April in Oklahoma so
we'll see how that goes Marissa Reyes
says where do you see yourself in 10
years 10 years I will be at 29 so
hopefully marry with children that would
be nice maybe wanted to
it's already I think I want three kids
oh yeah
definitely married though hopefully I'm
still where to think about the next ten
years of my finds the first I'm gonna
spend the rest of my life with Gabby
Hutchinson 18 says what is your college
major I still haven't decided where I'm
gonna concert in but it's just general
like business management and I will
probably concentrate in either marketing
entrepreneurship
maybe finance all of these fun yak says
what is your favorite place to visit I
already kind of mentioned this before
anywhere warm on the beach
tropical prefer it Sophie Colin says
what is the name of your Black Tie Domi
parka when I get this question a lot
actually like hanging up over there and
is Patagonia downtown loft parka really
long it goes like to my knees which is
so nice and so necessary in the Boston
winters and all that links down below if
I can part the link to it McKenzie Jane
22 says is dorm life Effie you like
living in the city here as it still does
in campus I'm applying that cool then
you'll see you around I guess isn't
where you live on campus and to me it
feels like a city but also look at
campus like I live in West and West
feels a lot more campesi to me because
there is like grass there's like
athletic fields all over because it's
like we're most athletes live so that's
a lot more campus eat but if you live in
Central East Campus that's a lot more
City like especially East Campus like
this literally like right near Kenmore
Square so that's a lot more City like
you can kind of find both at BU which is
what I like so that is all the questions
I have at time for today and thank you
guys so much for watching this video
I'll see you my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
