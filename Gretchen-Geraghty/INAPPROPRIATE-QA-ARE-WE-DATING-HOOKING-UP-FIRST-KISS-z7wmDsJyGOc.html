know first amigo
I was a math are you kidding me GLB you
know who he is
I'm Barling I'm Gretchen his friend
Gretchen is basically the person that
made me I wouldn't be here without her
wait actually I was exactly earlier I'm
like so proud of you and Hallie you're
filming a Q&amp;amp;A for you guys it has been
so recommended do you think I think
everyone's been asking us so a being
Louisa just picked a bunch so they're
gonna read them off to us and we have no
idea they are like we actually have no
idea how do you guys meet
I honestly think I approach you in the
dining hall is that what you think yeah
I remember like beginning of sophomore
year and I was with Lucy like in the
beginning of the year we're like eating
water about I remember you're like hey
what's up but I knew you for a freshman
year like we kind of knew each other
mmm I saw you I said hey you're cool you
make youtube videos okay no I definitely
knew about you do you know about my
youtube like before bu once you have to
be able I think I knew about it before
please no way yeah because I'm always on
YouTube so I'm definitely new captains
the og BU youtuber King is gonna hit a
million before the end of this year but
just how she's about to pass me and I
know I'm gonna pass through in like a
week when I first like remember who you
are
I saw your Instagram and you have really
cool videos on your Instagram and I was
like he's like so talented at making
videos remember I was home and you
called me we're breaking up you called
me like out of the blue no no no Jenna I
remember I was like yes do it
and it obviously its impression of each
other well I already pretty much knew
you because okay watch your videos
Gretchen's the same person she has in
her videos I think my first impression
of our language that you would just like
really nice now going I remember you
cannot told me in the night on ok and I
was like I don't even know if he
remembers who I am like whatever so I
thought that was like nice favorite part
about College I know my 7th I saw her of
is rowing that didn't really were
getting there yes I think I'm looking at
them and whatever brtt oh it's
definitely me at my favorite part
because I met so many people that I
wouldn't otherwise
yeah no it's same for me Alfie no but I
know I long to say it just like the
social side of it and it's not exclusive
to be a like every college you go to
there's just so many new motivated
people yeah and it's really cool to just
expand your social horizons question is
from Ariane our fans wait you're too
fast before after you put toothpaste on
I don't know but someone in my house
brushed their teeth with peanut yeah
there was a tub of peanut butter and
then I looked at the toothbrush and it
had peanut butter all over it so I don't
know happen the night before maybe
that's like good fear teeth I literally
do both is that weird unique craziest
thing you've ever experienced that video
well
you could change one thing about each
other what would it be
you're stupid laughs honestly Gretchen's
two nights she's too nice
you're like too nice and too humble yeah
she's like take credit for the cool
stuff she does tell me that I like I
would put you in a quest room this is a
fan favorite you guys everything we do
aren't dating this is the scandalous
inappropriate the keywords
yeah inappropriate yeah I don't know let
us know in the comments
yeah you guys is what you think the
first kiss story isn't also a fan
favorite yeah we can't hear I was
worried because I like kept feeling like
a highs like it over with right and I
was at a rowing race over this summer
and I was like far away and then this
boy was like rowing with our club that
summer he like didn't know him because
he was like from another town all week
we were like buddies I remember we watch
Pretty Little Liars together and I was
like he's a keeper
and then it was the end of the week and
he was gonna leave and then he hadn't
changed his train to go home to the next
day so he could like stay with me and
like watch my race or whatever I don't
know and then it was just like this one
night and then we were in this hotel and
he kissed me it was a horrible first
kiss her first major either one works
the first nado I was eight and a half
are you kidding
you know my first kiss I was 12 and I
was going into 6th grade that's kind of
a two-part story but my friend Robbie
and I went to the beach these two chicks
and I had a big crush on one of them we
went to Chappaqua beach in Falmouth
which is like the cool hangout spot if
you're like between the ages of 10 and
13 we went to like the back side of the
beach with what it's sand dunes and it's
like very secluded area and I think we
started playing like truth or dare or
something like that and my boy Robbie
shower Robbie he like hooked it up he's
like a dirty bastard kiss and then she
the girl her name I don't care I'll say
I'll text her about this - she she did
all the work honestly like I was so
nervous she was like okay let's go over
there and like we went to an area that
was like away from my friend Robbie and
the other girl I remember so well she
was like all right so we could kiss or
we could just tell them the kiss and we
don't have to and I was like yeah well
smack on the lips and seal the deal
impersonate each other you have an
impersonation you're like no you're like
a really good like you like structured
look your morning routine I don't every
kind of bring you through our lines
running routine okay ready okay wake up
you have five seconds to get up that's
it I think you will be up enough I would
be like what's up bloggers you will be
up in those five seconds or else you
dock and then I forget the order of this
but you do find push-ups something like
that I watched his morning routine okay
okay and then you have to meditate which
I tried doing once but it's like too
much quiet and being still like I need
to be going but that's good for you my
dad tells me you write down gold alright
you know that all you have the parts but
it's a little bit out of order and then
actually doing this tip which is like
actually do this guy's cuz it actually
helped me and it's like don't go on your
phone until you do two out of those
three things that you want to do because
I don't get things done because I just
might go all the time so then he does
that and then he oh yeah like the
biggest question of the day how many
times did you guys hooked up I know this
will be the real deal
eh of course 89 want to know how often
do you guys see each other probably
gonna summer zero now a lot probably six
times a week there's probably one day or
we don't see each other yeah we're Kretz
jr. aggressive I don't think so
Livan are like even though I wrote and I
quit the like Mike regrets I have or
when I see someone that I like want to
say hi to and then I don't because like
I always say like say hi to people
before they say hi to you especially at
college as si they make friends and like
sometimes I'm walking and I see someone
and I'm I hesitate and then I don't do
it and I always walk away like you never
regret saying something when you do say
hi but when you walk away and you don't
it sucks
don't tell him he's gonna watch this
yeah he definitely saw me too and you
probably saw me be scared there were
three people living or dead thanks so
much for watching this video make sure

sweaty
