showing you a bunch of clothes and just
items that I got from Italy and they're
like right here started this background
kind of weird right now I just really
wanted to sit somewhere where there's
like good lighting because there's
windows in front of me and this is our
little like family room in our apartment
but there's some point your wires back
there with this TV and stuff and Luis's
taking out the trash and are like trash
chute right now so don't mind that um
but yeah I just got a bunch of stuff in
Italy that I wanted to show you guys and
I know a bunch of you were like please
do in Italy hauls when you do that and
then there's some stuff I got before
that I'm just gonna show you at the end
perfectly and then some stuff that I
actually got after I wanted it to come
in time for Italy a minute in it but
that's okay also this you probably can't
even really tell it's not much of a
difference but I just got my hair down
this morning
so no more room - yeah and it's yeah
really blonde and fun so that's that oh
wait actually this is from Italy I guess
I can just start with this so this just
says Firenze day cuz i'm italian / NZ i
don't know but it just means foreign and
Italian I'm I got it from brandy
melville and it's really funny that I go
to brandy Melville and we're like in
Florence because yeah there's brandy
mumbles in America so I got two other
shirts I got a red one and a white one
of a shirt that I actually already have
it's a cropped v-neck and I'm so
obsessed with the grande one that I have
that I knew I wanted other colors so I
just got the white one and I also got
the red one because I thought they were
so pretty
maybe next I'll show you maybe like kind
of an order of like chronologically what
I got I got a white gold and gold
necklace and bracelet this was the first
day actually that Maggie and I had our
first full day in Venice and our trip
went like Venice Florence Rome we were
there for eight days total I want to say
and I was with the company EF ultimate
break so if you haven't watched my vlogs
definitely go do that and I know I'm
like finishing them up right now so it
just came in this red little case and
pro tip if you have a purchase that you
want just like a big purchase that
you're planning to make on like jewelry
handbags stuff like that and you know
that they have them in Europe wait to go
get them in Europe because then they
will be tax-free because things that you
buy in like France Italy stuff like that
you'll pay tax on but then when you go
to the airport you get a tax refund and
you don't end up paying taxes so it ends
up being like a lot cheaper than
America if it's something that's really
sensitive because you know like the
percentage of tax I'm like a more
expensive thing will be like more than
yeah
hey Louisa what up girl I was like don't
mind we have a lot going on right now
basically we went in there cuz Maggie
saw and that cuz that she liked and she
actually got this exact necklace but in
all gold here wait I'll come close you
can see it's like that I don't know if
you can see it's like white gold and
gold little balls but just kind of are
alternating and I really like that
because it goes perfectly with my rings
if this will focus yeah it was perfect
and then I just got the exact same thing
but in a bracelet because we try it on
these necklaces and we're like oh my
gosh we love and then she's like well
you need the matching bracelet and this
bracelet I love I love with my cardi I
um
gold love bracelet just like simple when
I take off my room as one yeah see like
I think that just looks so cute together
and I love the white gold and the gold
together because it matches these rings
like I said and I just thought it was a
lot more mmm like chill and the gold
like I tried on the gold and I felt like
it wasn't me I felt like it was kind of
too much but it was like perfect on
Maggie so yeah I love those so much and
then we got like a tax refund on them so
we like save money that if you bought
them here in America and I got so many
questions on where we got them and the
place was called Camilla and as yeah and
it was just in like the st. Mark's
Square in Venice it's just like a little
jewelry boutique boutique type of store
I don't think they have like online or
anything they're just like a lot of
small stores there so that's that then
I'm gonna show you stuff from this place
I don't know what it's called but it was
a place in Florence I want to say it was
on our way to Florence from Venice we
stopped in Verona maybe it was in Verona
I'm mixing it all up because we're in
Venice Florence and Rome but then in
between vanished in Florence man
Florence in Rome we stopped a couple
places and went like shopping and
sightseeing so yeah but every was called
anyway so it doesn't really matter it
was just like this little boutique II
sure and I noticed at this one that my
pearl earring set the one out you guys
know I always buy pearls so it's so
weird that I like diamonds in right now
but I saw these ones and I was like
these are so cute they really wanted my
outfit so I picked him up and warm
around all day and felt really fun and
then yeah when I got back I was like oh
my gosh I need studs and I didn't
so I threw these little babies on and
it's really weird that I know of pearls
right now because I'm such a pearl gal
and then I also got this shirt Maggie
and I both got this charity says sister
season because we're always like listen
sis and we call each other sisters saw
your figure in the background I guess
can be I would say sis and sister and
yes would be thought these were really
cute and just had to pick up that and
Zara was like a big place for us in
Italy we like went crazy and Daraa and
Meszaros in Europe are so much better
than bazaars in America it's literally a
proven fact because they like started
there so if you're in Europe you got to
go to Zara I know they have them in
America but it's just not the same they
like really big ones oh wait question
these pants were also from that place
that I don't remember the name with
sister season and the earrings these are
dressed wait maybe it says on here oh
wait oh my gosh I'm so mixed up I
thought this was one that place but it
says are a woman on it okay these are
from Zara in their medium and I don't
know why I told you besides normally in
pants look at mediums in tops look it's
mom because that's just how I'm built
you know these are so perfect they're
like really flowy tan beige like gaucho
e pants but they really like cinch at
the top so I think they're so pretty and
fun and flowy and they're like comfy for
the summer but you look like put
together so I really like those and
apparently they were Zara I forgot
and then this dress is also from Zara
Maggie and I actually both got it we
were gonna wear on the same day together
or I wanted to and she was like no
that's weird but I like love matching
having it so fun so we both got this
base dress I completely copied her we
were in the dressing room together
trying stuff on and I was like what is
that I need it so yeah you both got this
dress I think it runs a little big just
because it's flowy
so I got a small and normally in dressed
as I'll get a small or a medium it
depends I just can't have dresses be too
short of me because like I'm five nine
so I normally have to go up to look at
medium so that they're not my butt but
this is perfect and it's so cute and I
love that it just ties right there you
can tie in a knot or bow so I like that
and I'm just gonna wear that all summer
when you see like 80 pictures in that
it's cuz it's my favorite and this I
also oh wait
dang it guys I'm gonna have everything
went down below that I can find in this
video like this are stuff I'll be able
to find random booty key stuff from
Italy I'm won't be able to find and then
a bunch of stuff let me show the end
from Express we'll be able to find so
everything that's in below case you're
rendering
okay then I saw this white little button
up and I really liked it because I have
another white button up from Reformation
but it has a collar and I like that this
one didn't have a collar and just kind
of like cuts like a little lower
I thought it was more casual and yeah
it's super cute also things runs a
little big because it's a small and if
it's kind of like loose so keep that in
mind but I really really like that and
then these jeans are so cute basically
Maggie and I would go deserve so much I
think doing three or four times and one
of the first times we went she got these
jeans and I thought they were so cute I
was like they look so good on you
I remember telling her she always is
good at finding jeans that are a good
wash like she always finds really blue
blue jeans which I like like I'm just a
really good color of them and I thought
they were so pretty and then I was like
I don't need them I have a bunch of
jeans and the next day we actually went
to subscribe or in Italy and she was
supposed to be and she was studying
abroad there and she was wearing the
exact same jeans and I was like oh my
gosh like now that you're ringing them -
I can just see like how beautiful they
are and I really love them and I really
need them so then when we went back
again they had them and I was like it's
meant to be how cute are these they just
look so cute on they're so flattering
and I don't have that many sardines but
I just love these and I actually think
these might run a little bit big too
because I got a 36 which is a u.s. four
and I feel like my other jeans from Zara
are a 38 but I don't know Zara's
confusing for me for jeans like I never
know what size I am in their jeans I
just trying to pair until it fits but
yeah I really like these and they're
super cute last two things from Italy
where big splurge is I just couldn't not
get something from Gucci it was the
truth of it because I know I learned all
about Gucci my luxury marketing class
and how they were started in Italy and I
know like so much of like their history
and origins and background so I was like
I need something from Gucci here and
this scarf just like jumped out at me I
thought it was so cute and again we
saved a bunch of money on both of these
not by not buying them in America so
just keep that in mind but I think
they're so expensive
and I just thought it was so pretty was
like this beautiful pinky purple color
and it's like silk and so soft and I
know you guys saw at my Instagram
picture that I tied it into a top so you
can be super like creative especially
with a scarf like this big and you can
make it into a top like that where you
tie on the front you can make it like a
bit
down on top like that that's so pretty
you can wear it like as a enduro oh you
can wear it as a scarf you can wear it
like supposed to be you can merit a
million different ways so I love this so
much and I think so pretty you can also
tie it around a bag around the handle
that's what the guy that was telling me
anything's it's so cute people do that
select that and I love it and I really
don't have that many scarves so yes also
I didn't have just like a plain black
bag I could just link on for like
nighttime or daytime just you know you
need a tiny little black bag so this I
thought was so perfect and it actually
comes with a chain like inside so it
just looks like this and you can wear
it's like a little clutch too just
holding it I love it so much it's like a
tiny little crossbody and like I said I
just literally had none and just like
jumped out at me I'm so cute
and maggie was like I love it too I mean
you're both obsessing over it so we
actually both got it and me like don't
mind when each other has the same things
or anything so I love it so much and I
has a bunch of pockets in here has like
one all the way back here has a bunch of
like card holders right there
there's a zipper in the front and I had
nothing from Saint Laurent either oh
wait I've seen on sneakers but not like
bad so you know I just thought it was so
cute and like even though the really big
purses that always remind me of Italy
and they're like super sentimental to me
so that's when I think it's good to
explore to spend a lot of money on
things especially good stuff you're
gonna use a lot yeah the rest of the 70
showing you from its room express
actually Ln these are from Gucci's well
but I got these with a before I went
because I wanted to wear them on the
plane in there when I was like traveling
around and stuff but they're just the
slides with like the red and green
little bows on them I know I show them
in a blog but I thought I would just
show them in a haul because I wear them
in a bunch in Italy - Rachel you guys
know Rachel Lindsey she was the
Bachelorette and I follow her and trim
and I saw an Instagram story of her
wearing them and I just loved them and
knew I needed them so then I wouldn't
got them and I love them you're so cute
I'm about to go to SoulCycle and I'll
wear them there so really bougie okay
showing you it's room Express I wonder
stuff I wanted for Italy but actually
just these got shipped separately and
came like the day before I left so I
wore these the whole time I don't have
you can tell how like worn and they look
now but they're kind of raggedy already
I think they said Express on down here
but I wore them out but there's still
really good quality shoes like they're
still holding up and I love them and I
think they're so cute but the
they look like this is because I walked
eight or nine miles every day for two
weeks straight in these puppies I've
wore them literally the whole time
because they go with everything and
they're so adorable so I highly
recommend we can all have them linked
down below
yeah that's why those are born in and
the rest of the stuff is new so this
dress I thought was so so cute when I
ordered it and I love it it's so soft
it's like this beautiful kind of vintage
II not vintage like acid wash that
what's called kind of like distressed
gray and it's like a t-shirt dress and I
love the little detail on the back that
makes little different and I just love
wearing these t-shirt dresses like
running around doing errands in the
summer because you don't even have to
think about your outfit you just throw
it on it could also dress it up with
like your little YSL crossbody and like
foodies or something to like for dinner
you know so I just like I'm obsessed
with the stuff I got from Express then
this I just pulled out from the middle
because I couldn't wait to show you any
longer it's this army green romper and I
love this I actually just ordered a army
green what's it called in that place you
jumpsuit with like the long pants from
princess Polly because once I got there
I was like oh my gosh I want it in long
I want and everything I think it's just
so cute I think this is so stinking cute
and way different than anything I have
and it just looks like that I feel like
um what's it called
Indiana Jones something like that he is
I've been like camo Queen especially
from express you guys know I have this
those - what camo sweatshirts and
everyone's like obsessed with them and
wants to know where they're from they're
from Express I don't think I may sell
them anymore though we just had and they
were kind of overpriced TBH they were
like 80 bucks and I'm like can I borrow
these what you're $80 like they're the
best budgets ever but like why are they
$80 you know these are just like light
camo print jeans are kind of like
distressed looking frayed at the bottom
and I just thought they were so cool cuz
I don't have that many like camo pants
so these are gonna be really fun that's
who style I've literally been in a camel
Queen okay then when I was scrolling
through her jeans because you guys know
all right I don't know if you know
whether genes are actually my favorite
like so many my jeans are from expressed
like probably most of them the majority
and I only have skinny jeans which you
remember when you were younger and I
burned younger we'd owe 8 when I was
younger me my friends would always wear
like bootcut Abercrombie jeans just
bootcut Jean for the thing and I don't
even really know if they're in right now
but I saw a model wearing these ones and
I
they look so cool on her they just flare
it like the teenies bit so I think that
makes them like bootcut and not flare
and then ripped on the knees but they're
still like skinny and fitted all the way
down and then just flare out like a tiny
bit so I thought these were like so cute
on the model I really hope they're cute
on me too but I just thought I would
switch up the jeans you know because I
have so many skinny jeans these I'm so
excited to wear they're just like tan
wedges from Express I had one pair
budgets for the past four years since I
graduated high school and I burned them
like crazy my Steve Madden ones and
they're so dingy now because I've worn
them for so long so I knew I need a new
pair and these are perfect and they look
a little bit lower than my see
Madeline's my c901 to like 5 inch wedges
and I couldn't walk in them so they
seemed a little bit more reasonable
maybe like three and a half or so well I
just got this swimsuit top because I
thought it was so what beautiful it's
like this pinky red color and it just
like has those ruffles right there and I
could mix it and match it with so many
bottoms already have so I love that as
well and this bodysuit I have in black
but I just ordered it in this like
maroon purpley color and okay literally
on camera it looks maroon but in real
life it looks purple so yeah it's like
tie somewhere in between and yeah it's
just like deep-v long-sleeved bodysuit
and I wear my black one all the time so
I thought it would be fun to get in a
different color then these I saw I feel
like these were on sale or clearance so
maybe go check these out quick if
they're still available on our website
you guys are just gray leggings but they
have stars all down the side and they
remind me so much of if you guys know my
is it Tommy Hilfiger I'm pretty sure
mine it's gray it's like really dark
grey Tommy Hilfiger zip up and has stars
on the sleeves like right here
and Maggie and Maggie doesn't have hers
anymore Anna still has hers and I got
them because they have them I thought I
was so cute so basically what I'm trying
to say these remind me of that and I
just love like stars right now like
added detail I think it's really cute
and then this shirt I got because Mandy
had it in literally the same one button
black and I thought I was so cute so I
just got it in like tan like a t-shirt
and just has like a little slit right
there you know then this body see what I
saw and it was like whoa baby I need it
I literally have this exact body suit
and white already and so I was like why
don't I have a black one and got it in
black this black body suit I was like
also I need this I had
black American Apparel Halterman and I
lost it so long ago so this is literally
just like that but from express and I'm
really excited to wear that out as well
this I would say has to be my favorite
thing out of this whole haul video
because when I saw it online I was like
oh baby I need that I feel like I'm
always looking like a plain white
sweater just to throw on with like
anything because white will match
literally anything so this I saw online
and I was like this is literally so
perfect it's not just a plain white so
much it that will look kind of like lazy
and because it has like the what's it
called lace up detail right there it's
like I'm agitated this was just plain
white you think you like rolled out of
bed but I think with that detail it like
looks really cute and I'm so excited to
wear that okay two more things so these
black jeans I got cause like I said
they're jeans are my favorite and I
wanted to their jeans run big too
because I get a two in their jeans and
I'm just not a two anymore i was like a
zero in and two in high school but in
express genes i'm and shoe so i think
they run a bit big normally in their
shorts and skirts don't get like a for
just the colors i like shorts and skirts
a bit looser than like jeans like i want
to needs to be tight tuck me in you know
anyway so i got these black high-waisted
jeans and they have some distress
distress news like holes in the knees
that you're really cute and you can
never have enough black jeans and then
the last thing i got i thought was joke
you it's just this long-sleeve pinky
champagne like satin top that like laces
up in the middle and this will be so
good for like going out to dinner and
stuff i just love it i think it's so
cute and yeah i think that was
everything wow that took me a while to
show everything but everything I got in
Italy I'm so obsessed with and then
everything I got for like before and
after and around Italy I'm also obsessed
with them and get so cute again
everything will be linked down below so
