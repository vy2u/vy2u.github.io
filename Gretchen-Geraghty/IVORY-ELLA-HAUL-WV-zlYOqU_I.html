today I just have a little haul video
for you guys I thought I'd just do a
little haul video of just one store to
just like try out and see if you guys
like smaller haul videos because I know
I can't really sit through a long video
so probably some of you were like thank
God like only like a five like
six-minute long video instead of like a
20 like some of my videos are so long
you don't have to waste like 20 minutes
of your day also sorry right now if you
can tell like I'm kind of sick like I
sound like congested maybe just comment
down below and let me know if you like
like shorter haul videos or like longer
ones because I think usually I do like
really long collected ones but this is
just gonna be obviously for ivory Ella
so it's going to be like a short little
haul video just a couple things you know
you know without further ado I know I
like to get really chatty at the
beginning of all that is before actually
showing anything but I got a bunch of
things from my reality and I'm so so
excited to be working with them like so
excited you don't even know honestly one
of my favorite companies ever I remember
when they started like a year ago I was
Justin and his family and Jacqueline
Justin sister and Alison his mom were
like showing me every Ella because I
didn't even know what it was all this
information about I really like starting
up was on Twitter and everyone was like
tweeting about it and getting all hyped
about the release and ever since then
I've just been obsessed because you guys
don't know me at all like you've never
seen my videos if you have you know I'm
obsessed with elephants Exhibit A oh my
gosh wait hold up hold up Exhibit B
right here in my pillow pet alright
Exhibit C like I am obsessed with
elephant so the fact that I'm real is
like an elephant based company and it
helps elephants and stuff it just makes
me so happy and I just freaking love
elephants if you guys don't know oh my
gosh I don't think I told you I actually
for my 19th birthday this past March
Justin got me an elephant like you know
when you adopt an elephant so I get like
little monthly updates and like pictures
of it and like drawings and stuff so
it's so great if I haven't convinced you
yet basically I just love elephants so I
just bought Viper yella I hope this
gives you some inspiration of like maybe
ones that you want to get her trial
because their clothes are so cute first
one I got is just this light blue line
I've only had to like long sleeve ones
before but I thought I would try out the
short sleeve ones because it's going to
get caught out in the summer so I
thought get more use out of like the
short sleeve ones and I can wear them
like over my swimsuits and stuff all
their pockets in the front have that
cute little elephant design back looks
like that the same like elephant disarm
and then this has like the hamsa print
on it or you really blow dry your hair
when I'm filming my haul video
dorm life props will wait legit getting
louder solid alright
we're back this next one I'm going to
show you is the one that I wanted so bad
I'm pretty sure it's new cuz I haven't
seen it before until recently and it's
just his light green long-sleeve it
seriously so cute the reason I love it
is cuz look at the back like how
beautiful is that print next long-sleeve
I have to show you is just this
long-sleeve purple one with elephant
pocket same on the front and the back
just has this white like paisley print
on the inside I have this exact one in
navy blue and I love it I read all the
time
so I just never know what this one my
hair is just not cooperating very fast
time to show you it just this red short
sleeve on I think this is so cute I just
love red I don't know why I recently
I've been like drawn to red clothing if
you saw my three people fall I got that
like red tank top because I feel like I
don't really have red clothes so I like
one like try out summary clothes and
like see if I like wearing red but yeah
I just think this is really cool look at
the back it's like different than the
other ones it has this really cool
design it's like a circle and then
there's an elephant on the inside and
there's polo like also two chevron print
right there just think this is really
cute too and then also with my package a
bunch of these purple and black design
elephant sticker so these are really
cute to you
and I don't like stick them on all these
things and Justin like love stickers so
I'll probably give him some so yeah that
was everything I have to show you from
ivory Ella and as you can tell I'm
obsessed with like everything that I got
and I just love their bread so much I
hope me trying them on helped out too
for sizing size references my to say all
these are in a size small if I can find
the links to these I will put them down
below so that you couldn't see the exact
ones that I got if you are interested in
getting the same one is me
we can be twins you can tweet me
pictures of you wearing the same ones
it'll be great so you guys so so much
for watching and I'll see my next video
