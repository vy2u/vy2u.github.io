excited hey everyone so today hey
everyone so today we are hoping a
boyfriend versus like twin sister
challenge it's gonna be like who knows
me better and I think honestly that Lucy
will win because I've known him for like
19 years of my life but justin is under
the impression that he's gonna win
whoever wins we decided I will pay for
half of their ray-bans of their choice
because okay oh you don't radians well
I'll just give you half of what amount
of Ray Bans cost and cash more there's a
bunch of their bare hands or ribbons you
want to fish okay we'll figure the
prizes out I wrote seven questions in
case you guys are wondering question
what what is my biggest fear you are
both gonna get it wrong no it won't you
know it I think I know it
high right that's two options I wrote
two options oh my god like drowning or
burning in a fireplace in my head there
is one answer it honestly I'm leaning
towards them but I think it's fear and
I've told you about this numerous times
my biggest fear honestly is being stuck
in a cave with the water rising and then
that would qualify as drowning in the
site anak when the water is rising in a
sinking ship it is so scary
so basically drownings I think Justin
when you cook someone on your bed is toe
scary yeah you guys every single time
you tell the story on just enough
grabbing your ankles
you're like guys scariest thing my whole
entire life yeah it's like oh I did cry
that would yeah so we thought honorable
take ding ding I think Jeff Simmons that
one so because that was he in turn my
head don't worry Lily also win cross
question who is my favorite actress
Blake Lively yeah you're both right okay
lovely then I guess Lucy would oh no you
okay you all got it two to one third
question if I could be an animal what
would it be
I think is obviously an elephant
elephant yeah you're both right because
then you want to say what my favorite
animal cuz obviously the elephant but my
sandwich in alone I wanted six and you
are all nice like elephant okay okay
we're hanging this one just some oh no
what is this scar on my elbow from right
there
what is that look our animal postures no
it's not I told you 75 it's Lucy's death
look I think you guys know well if you
don't know I'm gonna be really offended
that is my god I wasn't even with you
when it happened but yes you weren't
like that sighs well the other day I
wasn't with you later Lori with mom real
quick I was amazing so maybe my elbow
right here is from like a 5 which is
like this little concert saying when I
was little and I was walking around I
was really crowded and this old man was
like smoking a cigarette anyone like
that and like stuck it on my arm and I'm
we were playing I was like mom oh and
like I literally have a scar because he
like what's it called when you go
without a cigarette
I don't know how to smoke but it like
hit my arm and it like hurts so bad it
was like this big burn so yeah basically
that's why I have a scar 3 3 D what is
my favorite store right now if you don't
know just give a little gift both of you
might not know but if you really know me
figured apple a silly go top brandy
I know I know it's like it could be just
what my favorites are you okay let's see
urban osburgh slash free people and you
wrote naked the answer is
if I wrote to I would I got it right
over to urban outfitter and you get zero
gotta move quickly my friends I just you
just read a pen on me
you're just elbow me so I think there's
favorite urban outfitters sure I thought
one of you to figure out how I thought
it was from like someone's out my three
point five to three
what was my base insecurity as a
freshman in high school
see how one would be like an overall
insecurity but it's not that one that's
a hint well it is one I like that was
only like only freshman in high school
yeah I know what you're gonna say but
that's right so don't say that that's
the only no I am too just think harder
what was my biggest insecurity as a
freshman in high school okay thank you
guys and you're to answer trick to give
you like it well you know it's not it's
not like one specific answer like you've
never said youth insecurity oh yeah oh
oh I have wait you have like the same
answer yeah you guys are right skin
pimples hey I'm Eric try over help us
now four point five support no no you
don't it's not my biggest insecurity it
was my cookin I had really bad acne
freshman year and they blocked question
is oh dang you're rocking it oh right
it's a love affair
what's or will I need a CEO of when I'm
older said it so many times
sir was a clear answer to it so
obviously we need five point five to
five I wanna have a point she got it
when she got to it first
oh yeah and I like three people too and
you're naked and that's not maybe right
now no 5.5 but you got five and you know
I guess some change you honestly
probably should get another have a point
so I'm really afraid to change my life
but you do that too but that's not my
insecurity but you know what since
you're both wonderful human beings I'll
give you okay do you want you both your
presents fair time so you could we're
all friends here you don't stick teddy
I was gonna say where is he he's
downstairs okay so I guess that is it
for the boyfriend versus twin sister
