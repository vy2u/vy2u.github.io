favorites and i'm really excited to be
familia because i haven't filmed a video
in the longest time and I know it's
august already but I have some really
exciting stuff to show you for july that
i've been loving i loved a lot of like
fashion stuff and i have some beauty
things too and i thought i'd just
include some things that I've used up
because i think if i've used them up
there like probably something that i've
liked like a favor because if i don't
like something i usually just like throw
it away or like put out your icing and
forget about it just get right into it
this is a shirt that I've loved I don't
know why but it's just like a t-shirt
and it has red and blue and white
stripes okay and then you see these
words right here if any of you know what
these words mean can you please like
tell me I know it must be French or
something and I try like typing it into
google translate and nothing came up but
yeah if you can figure out what this
means i will love you forever I don't
know what it means but I don't know I
think it's just a really cool t-shirt
and it's really comfortable to just like
throw on I really like a bag you like
stretchy things for the summer because I
can just throw them on and yeah I've
just really been liking this and this is
for my website that I forget the name of
it's like start span s i'll link it down
below and that's where i got this hey my
next favorite is also from that same
website which i will have linked down
below and it's this black sweater and it
has white stars on it and i think this
is so cool I feel like wildfox or has
sweaters like this and you see it has
all these little like rips down the
front and on the arm sleeves and I
remember Hanna Marin padilha liars worn
a sweater like this in one episode so it
makes me like it even more and it's
really lightweight and nice okay my next
fashion favorite just comes from brandy
melville is this black and white long
sleeve t-shirt and it's just really
really really stretchy and comfortable
it's so soft just like all the things
you know that material that like all
their things made all their clothes are
made out of and it's just really thin
blood
my stripes and yeah I just like a lot
it's really comfortable I wore it in an
upcoming video which is like a
back-to-school hair makeup and outfit
that will be my next video so keep an
eye out for that and yeah this is just
really comfortable so I like this a lot
and then my next to come from this
website called chicnova and oh my next
three come from this website called
chicnova and I really like the website a
lot I'll have it linked down below so
you can find all these products and the
first is these lace cream shorts and I
think these are so so adorable but a
little bit high waisted and they just
have these really pretty detail there
just like cream and our lace and they go
cute with a lot of things and they're
really cute for the summertime
especially and then the next thing
that's that I've been loving from chic
Nova it's just this cream lace shirt
don't wasn't the same kind of thing is
this um it's kind of like boxy and
fringy and it's so adorable my name's
bring people out with like high-waisted
shorts or over bathing suits really nice
and then the next thing from chic Nova
that I've been loving is this ring and
it's just it's like a silver ring and I
don't know has this cool like design on
it I don't really know how to explain
but it's really long and yeah I really
like it a lot this is a perfume and it's
called pink sugar I got it a sephora i
really really like this perfume if any
of you smelled it or have it it's very
very sweet like it smells like cookies
and cupcakes and almost gives me a
headache is almost overpowering at times
i have to be in the mood but this month
I've just liked it a lot I think I like
it more in the summertime and it's
really sweet and just smells like candy
so yeah I really been liking this
perfume and I kind of have morning boys
right now do you hear me it's always
scratchy because it's so early in the
morning because I'm just like really
busy over the summer and I have work and
everything so I have to film that really
early in the morning to just get filming
done with and I I've been so busy like I
haven't had any time to film so that's
why i haven't had a video open forever
and I'm really sorry about that but um
crew is about to end after we go to
canadian henley so then i'll have way
more time to film and I'll have a bunch
of my badge school app Oh back to skate
videos that's cool back to school videos
in August and stuff like that so you can
keep an eye out for that but yeah I
really like that perfume this is a
moisturizer and it's aveeno ultra
calming daily moisturizer SPF 15 I
really like this a lot um I put it on
before i go to work which is like I
lifeguard so it helps keep my face not
sunburn and yeah it's just a really nice
moisturizer and I like it because it
doesn't be my face all greasy like some
moisturizers make my face feel really
like I don't know like you know what I
mean like wet and it looks kind of oily
but this looks sinks in and it looks
really nice and it's almost gone I've
used it like all this month and it's a
really nice moisturizer and I also feel
like it's like helping clear my skin
like it's not making my skin worse which
is really good because a lot of products
I feel like just more products just like
make my skin irritated in like worse but
that's I feel like it's been helping my
skin so I really been liking that and
then the next one I'll show you is empty
and it has been for a little while now
it's the soap &amp;amp; Glory face soap in
clarity superfruit plum blah blah blah
and this actually kind of smells weird
it smells like a nursing home I don't
know how to explain it this smells kind
of weird um I actually finished it up
with a long time ago but i thought i'd
show you because i did like it um it's
not like an amazing amazing cleanser I
don't know it's like it's like oh right
I didn't see any like big differences
with like clearing at my skin or
anything it was probably okay though my
favorite cleanser that I've been using
for real time now is the purity by
philosophy which you can get at sephora
that should actually be in this paper
it's the purity by philosophy go get
that face wash it's my favorite but yeah
this one's pretty nice too so i guess i
would recommend it I don't think it's
that expensive either because the purity
I know is really expensive I got get the
really big one that'll last me a while
and I'm pretty sure that was like 40 50
bucks so um yeah this is nice anyway
of this here mac mineralize skinfinish
natural and medium plus i would focus it
in and there's literally no left like
can you see like that is like straight
up like the bottom of the pan like I've
tried to use it nothing left so yeah
obviously I really like this and um I
really really like this it's really good
just like light powder with my skin is
improved so much thumbs up this video if
you want a look how I cleared my skin
video or like skin care routine skincare
story something along those lines
because I start terrible terrible
terrible skin it was so bad look if you
look back to my older videos you'll see
it please don't know it's awful um but
so my point is my skin is like a lot
nicer now so I can just get away with
using like a really light powder so this
has been really nice um it just kind of
evens out your skin tone it's not like
if you need like a full coverage powder
I definitely say go for like the studio
fix or something because this is not
like full coverage at all it's good like
a setting powder or just um to look even
out your skin tone a little bit or like
mattify your skin for this summer which
is what I've been using it for so I've
probably little repurchases powder i
really like it a lot but when did i say
i'm in the color medium plus yeah okay
if i'm not in focus this video i'd
probably cry I'm sorry I'm terrible of
focusing okay and then the next thing is
the too faced chocolate soleil bronzer
and it smells so good I have talked
about this ever since I first started
making YouTube videos like a year ago
and it smells so but that's not why I
like it I like it because of the color
um i have like Laguna and I have some
like hula and stuff i like those
bronzers but they're kind of light and
in the summer I don't like a really
drunk bronzer because my skin so dark
already that like if I want bronzer I
want it to be darker so you can like
tell it it's like bronzers like actually
doing something you know and this is
like a really really really dark bronzer
which is why I like it so if you're
really fat
I probably wouldn't recommend it but you
can always like sheer doubt i know
there's a milk chocolate one though too
if you look really white um but i just
love it so much and it smells like cocoa
with chocolate so and i know there's
like real cocoa in there so yeah I've
just really been liking this and I use
it every day and I put it on like my
temples in my cheeks and yeah I just
love it a lot and then the next beauty
thing i have is a lip gloss which is
very surprising because i really don't
like lip gloss like i don't like it I
don't like the way it feels it's all
sticky and if I want to like talk or he
or do something I just feel like it's
look in my way I don't know the glass
bothers me except for this one if I wear
any lip gloss ever it will only be this
one and it's max petite indulgence and
it's like this really pretty hot pink
but it's like a lip gloss so it doesn't
like make your lips really really hot
pink like I'm right right now it's
really smooth on your lips i'm pretty
sure it's like a cream sheen and all the
words are broke doff because i've used
it so much but yeah um i would
definitely recommend like Max cream
sheen lip glosses because this I think
was limited edition but I really like
the formulation of it and I have some
other ones that I like to so if I ever
wear lip gloss it will only be this kind
I'm back and I've really been liking
this color for this one more time
actually any time I wear the color all
the time even in the winter look if you
see my old videos that the only lip
gloss I everywhere ever okay and then
these next two are also kind of beauty
ish third shampoos and conditioners and
they're the l'oreal total repair five
restoring conditioner there's water
dripping out of this because I just
grabbed it on my shower but oh my god
it's dripping water on me but um they're
just really nice shampoos and they're
almost empty like but do you hear
they're empty but um yeah I've really
been liking them a lot i'm gonna put
them down now because they're dripping
water on me but they they're really nice
I feel like they've been good at like
moisturizing my hair because my hair is
pretty
just like bleach blonde and yeah but um
it oh and they smell really good that's
why I like I'm I smell super good so I
definitely recommend those shampoos and
conditioners and then my very last
favorite is kind of random but I thought
I'd just throw in some food in here
because I just eat all the time it's a
problem I eat all the time and it's
usually pretty junky and this is kind of
junk food but it's like better like I
feel like I'm eating healthy when I'm
eating it uh and there the pretzel
crisps pretzel pretzel crisps dark
chocolate crunch and I'm not really sure
where you can get them I think we got
that Sam's Club I don't know if they
even have that where you live or
anything yeah I'm pretty sure to chain
maybe you can get them at like Target
i'm not sure but they're just like
pretzels dipped in chocolate I love
chocolate covered pretzels but these are
like pretzel crisps so I think they're
like better for you and then it's a dark
chocolate which is also better for you
and I would really ate this like entire
bag they are so good and it's empty so I
obviously love them and I'm definitely
gonna get them again we go there but
yeah they're just really yummy and that
was it for my July favorite so thank you
so much for watching and I will see you
in my next video bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
