video I haven't made one of these in a
minute long time and I just thought
they're like a pretty fun thing to do so
you guys can get to know me more because
you hear me talking all the time about
like clothes and makeup and stuff and I
feel like some of you don't really know
that much about me especially if you're
new to my videos and also I just want to
address really quick that I know a lot
of people at my school are finding out
my videos which is totally cool so if
you go to my school and you watch my
videos and shout out to you like cool
omere's commenting on my pictures and
Hannah okay so yeah if you ever see some
weird comments on my Instagram it's
probably from people I know that might
even be like whatever the question was
like people going on school now
alright like I'm not gonna like just go
around in my tell everyone because I'm
not just going hey watch my youtube
videos but like if people find out like
that's really cool and if you go to my
school you can totally just I talked to
me about it or anything like that so if
you got high school and you're watching
maine's right now I mean it's totally
cool
I know a lot people are finding out and
they don't really know anything about
anything weird but that is totally okay
tweeted out last night but like I don't
think a lot of you know that I even have
a Twitter so my Twitter's at gob lighty
I love Sarah here
I mean I tried to tweet more often as
for they're kind of confuses need
everything I also treat out when I'm
making one of these question-and-answer
videos so you can leave your questions
there and I also put a fix on Instagram
instead leave your questions below and I
think that's where most people pull up
their questions because most of you know
that I have Instagram
thank you follow me on hey I only got
like two questions on Twitter because
like no one really follows me on Twitter
and they're both for my friends the ones
from Jenny and she says why do you love
me I love you because you're wonderful
and musical and you're so pretty and
you're so cute and I'm so happy I got to
meet you New York petals are really
awesome so I'm so happy I met you Jenny
if you're watching this and I want a bit
and then Tasha my friend from fiercely
Tasha she said blondie and yes I would
love to be a Natasha favorite person on
it and I wanted my Instagram I know
there's a lot more questions there I'll
try to get through as many as I can
without it being like waiting too long I
just have mine all the questions right
here also I could go to my school I mean
I guess you can follow me on your
YouTube Instagram like that's me but if
you don't and you don't go to my school
and you watch my videos I also have a
private Instagram but I'm really just
trying to keep that like separate
anonyme like I'm gonna try to keep my
private Instagram
my friends and that my teacher blown her
just YouTube so yeah I'm sorry
did you find my private Instagram I'm
probably not gonna let you follow me
it's I just want to keep them separate I
don't want to get to make any drama or
cause anything like that but yeah if you
do go to my school I guess you can
follow me on my Instagram I know some of
you already did so so here are the
questions the first question is your
favorite summer drink
I'm actually not into that much of like
like Starbucks and like Dunkin Donuts
like all those really sugary drinks I'm
not like into that I'd be kind of make
my stomach hurt feel second stuff I
guess iced tea or like I also really
like this like coconut water and I know
a lot of my friends think it's like
disgusting that everyone's a Jew but I
know it said be really healthy for you
so I'll try to make myself drink it
because I looks good for you and it's a
perfection and everything so yeah I like
coconut water some kind of juice like I
really like cranberry pop
so I just like to say right now I'm not
letting any makeup at all
I think it's a good thing to be a
confident with that like at the
beginning of the year I'll just go in a
little side note at the beginning of the
year I had really really bad skin like I
struggled with my skin so bad and I was
really like self-conscious of it and I
like didn't I couldn't go anywhere
without makeup or like even like film
videos be on YouTube without makeup I
was really just like not happy twisting
and easier because my skin was just so
bad that sounds kind of bad to just like
how you're feeling based on your skin
but really like how your skin is is like
how can you perceive you and it's like
such a big deal for me so I finally like
went to a dermatologist and like I was
trying a bunch of different things to
try to like make my skin better and
better so right now my skin is like so
much better than it used to be
maneet obviously not like my skin is way
better than it was at the beginning of
the year are you confident without it so
I guess that's it
how old are you I'm at 16 years old and
it feels so weird to say that because I
still feel like I'm 15 but I am 16 years
old my birthday is March 11 1997 so yeah
that just happened this past March I
turn 60 do you have a boyfriend no I do
not believe my favorite store that would
have to be brandy melville I'm like
actually obsessed with her clothes
that's terrible I like I tweeted out the
other day like I stay up on my website
my money but yeah I wanted to say I love
brandy melville because seriously just
everything on there is adorable if you
can't find something on there that I
wouldn't love so yeah I just really like
brandy no no are you in college no I
just finished my sophomore year of high
school and I'm going to get junior
that's so beer I think I'm gonna be a
junior - guys don't feel like every
little 8th grader is your hair naturally
blonde no it's not I die it's naturally
kind of like I'm like a medium dark
brown
favorite thing to do in the summer and
this is kind of weird but I really
really really love going to attract like
I don't even know if you guys live near
a stroke but now there's a Canadian girl
popular restruck that you go and you
just like hang out and watch horses race
breaking out of the Sun and by yummy
food I don't know I just love it's
probably like if you had one YouTube
person to do your makeup who would it be
oh okay I don't even know if you guys
know this girl but she's I think she's
from Australia and her name's Lauren
beauty and she's like really good eye
makeup like I love the way she moves to
me go faster so I would have her to wake
up I know she works by Bobbi Brown or
something so yeah I just know she's like
really good how did she get started with
YouTube I feel like I answered this
question all the time but that's fine
I'll just answer again my friend Hannah
showed me like YouTube videos and I
thought they're really cool so I started
making them and she's actually
downstairs right now
studying with my sister for finals and
yeah today was my last final it was
chemistry and it actually wasn't started
and Suns gonna be show yeah I finished
my last panel today and Hannah I'm
Lucy's locks buying all this geometry
which is tomorrow but I'm all done and
yeah so that's I was just thinking she's
like that said she introduced me to
dangerous how old were you when you
started wearing makeup um I started
wearing makeup in like ninth grade like
13 14
I wasn't I mean I didn't start wearing
like I don't know I'm pretty lazy with
makeup like right now I can I wear any
makeup there's probably one of the first
videos where are you from um I'm not
going to say like the city but I live in
you know that some of you maybe even
already know I don't have but like some
of you like you know my last name and
like
I try to keep that kind of effort for my
YouTube I don't know but some of you do
know my last name and like my sterling
stuff but I'm usually not going to say
it this one says do you have a job yes I
do have a job I'm a lifeguard and I took
lifeguarding in this year as a gym class
the rest of the world and it was like a
really good opportunity so I could get
all my electronics certificates and I
work like right down the road I could
walk there but I want to so it's like
convenient it's like so close and
exhaustively CrossFit
today it's an all-day and it's never
really ever I definitely recommend like
being a lifeguard if you can and if you
like swimming and everything like that
because I just always felt like a
swimmer I used to be on the swim team
so if guarding is like a better job for
me what are your favorite sources Chapa
already said brand name album to me
favor store ever how did you get into
rowing crew this is a good question my
friend amelia is oh i don't even know i
don't think i'm really has ever been in
one of my videos but she's one of my
best friends and she introduced me and
my twin sister to growing in like eighth
grade now i'd really serious about
rowing like it's pretty much my entire
life like I practiced this afternoon and
starting this week we have morning and
afternoon practices so that's to be
really rough but me my twin sister are
in a double and we need to train and
everything for the guy who's coming up
in the summer so yeah crew isn't our
whole life now and I really do enjoy
it's a lot of fun and like whenever you
do well in regatta it's literally the
best ever because you work so hard to
like
competing where you're asked all-time
favorite memory you've had with Lucy
this is so cute um just been best
friends ever likes because we're twin
sisters and I'm always with her and
obviously we get in fights like a lot
and getting sick of each other but she's
my best friend no matter what and
growing up we we have a good really fun
childhood like our dad would always have
us to flutter pennies and we go places
yeah like the best dad ever like fun
things and I can just remember like we
go to our lake house every summer and
the same you'd always have a lot of fun
later and we still do so that's probably
my favorite memory would just be going
single yes I am single
hey Lucy your only sibling yeah she is I
wish we had more siblings cuz I think
people with big families if I could just
be a lot of fun but I told me yesterday
so do your friends know about your
channel if they do what Tuesday or u2
when they found out all my friends
really do know about my channel because
when I started I just told them like
straight out like I was like kinda like
YouTube videos a lot my friends watch
them anyway and I was just like I think
it's really cool I'm gonna try making
them and my friends are totally
supportive and like on board with me and
they're really awesome about it like I
said before a lot of people at school
are finding out which is totally cool I
mean obviously I'm putting myself out
there on the Internet
so it's bound to happen I guess and yeah
people are pretty cool with it and like
if anyone has a problem they can just
like talk to me about it you don't need
to like start over
so did people ever make fun of or make
fun of you or be worried about your
videos how did you handle it I think
maybe people talk about ride videos
behind my back but I kind of just like
ignore it and you don't really care
because videos so if you have a problem
that's your problem not mine like if you
don't like my videos don't watch them so
yeah how are you in how do you keep your
hair someone healthy and beautiful thank
you I am sixteen and I've been trying to
grow it out for a while here I don't
know can you look see how long it is
yeah it's pretty hard it goes like to my
bellybutton wait yeah because my
bellybutton and right now it's like
natural I like never leave my hair
natural but it just gets kind of wavy
when I sleep on it and right like I said
I just had finals today so I'm not
wearing makeup or anything in my hair
there's kind of natural and wavy I know
people are like you need to get it cut
like every month or something but
honestly like I get my hair cut like
okay well I got it cut in like February
and before that I didn't get it cut for
like a year and a half which I know is
so bad like I couldn't even like get a
brush dirt anymore but for me at least I
like don't cut it that much because
meaning to like give your hair time to
grow in between getting cut so getting
it hot every month definitely just does
not work for me because my hair
doesn't grow that fast to be able to get
to cut every month but if that works for
you and I guess that's cool
and healthy um I use heat on my hair and
like during the school year I pretty
much just hear my hug every day during
the summer I would say like I'm
definitely not gonna be using heat as
much and just try to keep the feeling
off your hair cuz I'm gonna bet against
it and definitely use like heat
protectant and I always use conditioners
really good conditioners sometimes I
wish my hair just so that the end it's
early nice are you excited for college
and if so what college are you thinking
I'm going to I actually call it really
makes me stressed out just thinking
about it because I don't really know
what I want to do with my life where I
want to go like what I want to do when
I'm older so College just really scares
me like getting into college I try
really hard in school and I'm always
like I'm doing my best in all my classes
because I know what I wanna I wanna like
go I have the ability to be able to go
to schools I'm gonna go do what I want
to have like a lot of opportunities
available so that when I do find out
what I want to do I'm with able to so
I'm just like Brooklyn are really hard
right now in school and I always have
been the guqin hard worker in school
because oh I saw this like really
foreign to me just like value in your
future and like having a good base of
what you're working on just say so I'm
sorry that doesn't really answer your
question Tasha - snapchatted me shoutout
but yeah I don't really know what
college I'd want to go to I really do
want to go to a college for a rowing
though like growing crew because I
really like roaming so maybe somewhere
in Boston Philadelphia
this one says do you ever have bum these
and of course I do today is one of that
because we just have finals so I'm just
writing like a sweatshirt in shorts and
I don't have makeup on and my hair is
metal so I would definitely say today
music yeah this one says do you consider
leggings as pants yes I do and a lot of
you has learned to say about that on my
outfit of the weeks but buttons are
pants I mean oh my gosh there's gonna be
like a hundred comments saying like how
like it's our pants I'm sorry I do wear
the most panties because they're just
and they cover your legs so they're
basically pants and I don't care if you
don't think that your are or not pants
but I will wear them as follows and then
the last question I'll be answering is
did you expect any of this to happen
with your YouTube channel no I really
didn't I just started making them for
fun and I never really thought anything
would like come from it and now that it
has like I'm just so thankful I'm gonna
spend like a lot of fun and I just make
videos because I have to share my ideas
with other people so yeah getting like
right now I think I'd like 10,000
subscribers or just like crazy
because I remember the day I've got 100
I started like crying since I'm so
excited
so the fact that like all of you are
watching me is actually so cool and I
can't believe I got in as far as I have
known Amy but I'm definitely making
videos really long time so yeah and
people will ask me like how to get your
YouTube channels started and it really
just like takes time like I remember in
the beginning I was so impatient and I
was like no watching my videos like it's
not even like worth it but it is you
just have to keep making them
subscribers really just take time like
getting to where I am over a year so it
just it just takes time is really all I
can say and you just have to be yourself
don't try to like copy other people oh
my gosh one thing I see all the time in
my videos people commenting like
subscribe to my channel and I was like
the most annoying thing ever like I know
it's really hard at the beginning to not
be like can you subscribe to me but it's
just really annoying one thing you can
do is like leave video responses those
always like help out together people in
your videos and just make like popular
videos that
people like watching and then they'll
find yours but yeah I don't like that
for subscribers because that's not cool
and all I can say is it really just
takes from that you have to be
consistent you just have to keep making
them and if I didn't answer your
question I'm really sorry you can ask it
again next time and maybe I'll get to it
but yeah I tried to answer as many as I
could without this being like 50 minutes
long so that concludes my Q&amp;amp;A video for
this month and I want to be trying to
make these like every month
can you thumbs up this video if you
liked it so I know if you want to see
more cuties and also right now I'm in my
room if you don't know I'm sitting in my
bed and you're some Christmas lights in
the plan it's really hard to find liquid
selling spots in my house because it's
always a dark and right now it's a
little but it's kind of like cloudy
stuff but yeah so thank you so much for
watching and I will see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
