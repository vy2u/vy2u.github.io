pretty different for the other my normal
one but I want these to be kind of more
than norm I'm just really been getting
back into beauty recently and something
that I'm so passionate about stole that
I really like and when I first heard of
my crush on those pity youtube channel
basically it was beauty and I just love
beauty and makeup but I just feel like
in the past couple years of my youtube
channel it's just been more like fashion
and I think I kind of lost my passion
for makeup a little bit probably
recently I've been so into like doing my
makeup it just makes me happy and I like
doing it for myself just can maybe do
some what kinda later let's kick
unboxing I bet I'm not even qualified
flex pay that could make a person I
already like three different times for
her website but I literally haven't
opened them so typically so I could do
this video and I know before I even
bought them I like looked on YouTube and
looked at other people's videos that
they made about them to see what ones I
wanted obviously not sponsor like I wish
Kylie Jenner would send me these but
like no she's too cool for me so let's
open up the first box OOP so this I
remember is the first package I got from
them this is back when they really sold
out all of them and I feel like recently
they've been like getting them back in
stock more he's like gonna get two kits
in the colors I wanted and Dulce K and
Posie K I had to just get like the
liquid lipsticks by themselves and they
couldn't come with awareness because
those are sold out let's try these
puppies out
Chiquitita zoom you in you probably
can't even see me alright Posie K I'm
gonna be a true beauty person and like
swatch this on my arm so you can see
okay
Posie K I just put it on I'm seriously
in love like this is so cute I feel like
I decided that I wanted to like try on
all these four months during the video
then I have to go through take them off
and put on the new one so I think I'm
just gonna wear this the whole time and
maybe I'll just like show you guys the
ones I got like on my arms you can see
there's suppose DK that's what it looks
like on my arm and on my lips can so far
what I can tell you just about applying
it I feel like it would definitely be
worth it to have with the lip liner I
might even go in and just buy that
separately because I have like liquid
lipsticks in liners before that aren't
like Kylie Jenner I definitely didn't
want it will be good because will help
it like stay on longer and this isn't
Dole CK o JK DOS
I don't even know looks like browner I'm
a little bit scared of Browns we'll see
how this goes who know that's like
pretty it looks like a Bobby Brown the
most so there's total say Kay and also
I'm really sorry I'm not like trying all
these arm but honestly I feel like I'm
not even that good
I'm like a makeup youtuber anyway so you
guys let me see like better videos about
these are probably out there then we got
exposed and this is like the full kit I
guess I'm not gonna do swatches of like
the liner because they're literally just
the same color so this is the liquid
lipstick and exposed all that was smart
and if colors I got I could have made it
cool and put them in like order black
color but that's what we got so far
Posie K tells PK exposed exposes like a
really pretty like brownie you nudish
peach I feel like person in the next box
I have a coke okay Kandy K in Malibu in
these luckily I was able to get like all
three kids and then in the third box I
just opened it to there is to lift kits
in dirty peach and love bite so I guess
- oh I one two three four five six seven
eight like almost a cuz two of them I
couldn't get two lip liners but um yeah
so those are the colors I have first
we'll open up coke okay this is so
pretty but I'm a little gonna take this
off and put this on because this is such
a pretty like light pink that's like
right up my alley guys it's like a baby
pink that's show me I just look at that
that is just so cute coke okay yes okay
now we're gonna open Kandy K this is
really pretty too time similar does it
cook okay oh no it's not it looks kind
of like exposed actually on but like a
little more pinky and brown because
explodes I think it's like more Brown
okay and then the last ones Kandy K now
we have Malibu it seriously feels like
Christmas oh that's really pretty too
there's Malibu we could have colorful my
arm is alright two more
we got dirty peach oh those of you that
were wondering like I said I'm like
getting back into makeup so basically if
you're wondering are I win like psycho
and ordered all of these I feel like
when they first came out I was like oh
like I don't need to like join in all
the hype like
even about anyway like I probably don't
need them you know but then I was like
crash I'm like I really want that okay -
and I'll just speak me happy and I like
don't have that much lip stuff well I
have a bunch of these really old MAC
lipsticks but I'm like not really into
lipstick and I think these are like a
lot more wearable than lipstick you know
that like moves around and comes off
seriously cuz these are like way more
long wearing so then I was like why not
just get a bunch of colors and dry it
out there's little is like a streak and
my bronze right there that's so
embarrassing I didn't get food in my
face and I was eating and I like one
like that and it literally took off my
bronzer okay nice back to dirty peach
whoa okay I'm scared this isn't gonna be
like a flattering on me because I feel
like orange II like warm tones don't
look this really good I mean I feel like
this would be good on the one that's
like really tanner I was like a
different like skin tone to me but that
is what it looks like in case you're
wondering can last but not least is love
bite oh my gosh this is really dark and
way out of my comfort zone but maybe
I'll wear it like later on in the fall
because it's like purpley Brown oh my
gosh but you know why did you get this
this is a little result of like three
I'm shopping online there's love but wow
there is what all the colors will look
like and yeah they're just in the order
that I showed them I feel like this
video probably was not helpful at all
because there's way better like Beauty
youtubers out there than mean I have
like a way better handle on all of this
I don't know what I'm doing and like I
said if you wanted to see like swatches
of these are like I'm like Posie K like
right there like you can probably find
them on Google Images like literally
just search it up it'll come up so yes
this video is fun for me I hope it
helped at least like one or two of you
in some way maybe if you saw colors that
you liked on my arm right here and can
you guys leave me comments down below
with beauty videos that you would like
to see cuz I think that would really
help me out so yeah I just watching this
video I don't see my next one I look at
put soap on it to get it off and it
literally doesn't going on I'm about to
film like a clothing haul video and this
is literally gonna stay on my arm for
the video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
