a haul video for you I just got back
from LA today over channels fiercely
Tasha by the way okay alright period
soon but we've done so many videos
together it was really fun and
disclaimer we have to mention like right
now before this video goes on any longer
that we had a red eye and like did not
sleep at all either better so we're
literally delusional right now so if we
ever like don't make sense in this video
or a lot of times when I'm tired I like
switch words around so if I like don't
make sense since that's why Wow I'm
ready tripping over my words we just got
a bunch of stuff over there but you're
both saying how we spend way too much
money I want to make a little disclaimer
so Gretchen is posting a lot of vlogs
from LA and on one video like every
single comment was talking about how I'm
either mean or rude or don't like
Gretchen or I'm like glaring at her or
rolling my eyes and I'm not trying to do
honestly like I have the most severe
case of resting bitchface and I have
heard like a quieter personality I'd say
I'm only happy for like outgoing and
bubbly like Gretchen so like when she's
blogging I'm just kind of like chill I'm
like yeah I'm iPhone let her do her
thing so I'm really not trying to be
rude and I don't want you guys to not
like me or like leave negative
negativity on Gretchen comments because
I don't want her to feel awkward from
now so that guy's like we're friends
like we've been doing videos for so long
together like if she's mean to me I
would have you been for the first like
don't worry about that yeah so if you
don't like me don't take it out on
Gretchen
yesterday morning we went to Melrose
trading post it was really cool Tasha
I've been wanting to go for a while like
a flea market but more trendy than
anyone I've ever been to and a lot of
like furniture jewelry clothes vintage
II kind of things yeah the first thing I
got are just two bracelets and what I'm
wearing right now I'm like obsessed with
it basically I really wanted bracelets
like this for a while because Jo Jo
Fletcher liked the batch electronic mr.
Graham you go under insert him you can
see I she put one with like rocks like
this and they're so pretty and I went so
website and they're like really
expensive so I found this and I was like
yes plus this is like my favorite color
ever and then I got Lucy this one which
just is like a white stone and like a
little cuff the next thing I got from
Melrose trading posts I just got this
scarf which is for Justin cuz he's like
a huge Rams fan and those I just know
he's gonna love like okay this is gonna
go up after I get step
I can talk about it but he like loves
the rim so much they used to be from Los
Angeles and then they were in st. Louis
and now they're going back to LA and I
just know he's gonna love it and then
the last thing I got from Melrose
trading post or just these American
Apparel high-waisted shorts which are so
cool if you guys like no I'm pretty
cheap pretty sure these are like 60 or
70 dollars like I don't even know yes I
saw them and they were just like a
little gem hiding and I was like yes the
first thing I got is a necklace from
London Minori I don't know if I'm so fed
up oh she just has a shop there or what
but I wanted one like this for a while
on top it's just a chain like this and
then it goes down into this little geode
and then this chain just hangs down
pretty low with this little gold piece
on the end I got another necklace this
is a choker and it's kind of a funny
story I was standing in the Little Shop
area and this girl was trying it on and
it looks so good on her I was looking at
it oh my god it looked really good and
then she didn't get it she put it back
and I scooped that up so it looks like
this hopefully you can see it's just
kind of a silver choker with little like
horn in the middle with a turquoise
jewel and I have a very small neck I'd
say and this actually fits me so oh by
the way we're wearing matching shirts
you probably can't tell they're
different colors but they both have this
little like peplum thing at the bottom
we actually both have that one in both a
vest and I've ever been to a last thing
that I got from the Trading Post was
from her really yeah literally
so this is the top it's just like a
little crop top of the tie and then the
bottoms are just these little flowy
shorts and I thought this would be cute
together
and separate
here's a kid
we have brandy melville and when I'm Fe
you like Bernie Melville's right down
the street and I feel like I just don't
take enough advantage because when I
went to the one in Santa Monica and the
one in the good robe I liked on so much
stuff so the first thing I got is just a
present that I'm giving to Lucy it's
just this red t-shirt with a bunch of
holes also I didn't even mention I
forgot as you guys probably know if you
see my halls I always do like try on
haul videos but this we just decided
we're not gonna make a try and all
because we're really tired and we just
don't feel like it this is a stretcher I
got Lucy that's a bunch of holes we're
like really distressed and then I just
got this Santa Monica sign which I
really really like and I have a bunch of
other like ones from brandy melville
that I have just like hanging in my room
like on top of doors so I just know
where I'm gonna put this in my room
already and I really like it and it'll
remind me wanted it to LA then I just
got shorts
and I got two pairs they're the same
kind but different colors so the first
ones I got just red they're all red and
really comfy and I like the cut of these
a lot and so I got my $2 and they're
like high-waisted enough on me which is
good because Tasha and I like we
discussed earlier realized that I have a
really long torso so these actually I
feel like you're less high waisted in
the red ones but I like these two
they're just all black oh the last two
things I have to show you from brandy
melville are actually from the brandy
melville sample sale Illyria Miller with
Santa Monica
there's third Street and then there's
fourth Street and the main stores on
Third Street but on 4th Street
I keep saying the street there's
actually a really tiny store where they
put your clothing that has like some
defects or it's just like their t-shirts
without the graphics on them so there's
a lot of cute stuff and everything is
50% off
I found this white long-sleeve
long-sleeve Kitchener my crutches white
long t-shirt dress however on me it's
like barely a teacher trans because I'm
- I so I know like the beach
yeah it would be a t-shirt dozen most
people it's like almost too short
species for trust on me like I probably
like I know I'll try to wear this one
anyway it's like almost showing my butt
and these puppies normally wow I feel
akatosh to actually try them on first
but they really quite big on her so
they're just these green
like Levi's like high-waisted jeans and
I just not they're really cool it's a
little big on me but I feel like they're
gonna be okay when I cut them into
high-waisted shorts I got one thing from
the normal brandy store and I actually
wore this on the plane it's just this
kind of sweater II material burgundy
three handli
high low middle of the room like Henley
top I think that's what it's called in
there's buttons and then from that a lot
store I was telling you guys about I
forgot about I got these overall they're
pretty normal looking except this part
doesn't have like a little clasp that
most overalls do so all I have to do is
cut a little slit for the button and
like put it in so it's fine and I like
the overall trend so me do now we're
just going to show you stuff that we got
at Bloomingdale's Nordstrom's thing I
got from Nordstrom and they're just
these Kate Spade sunglasses and I wasn't
really planning on like buying them but
they were on sale okay so I just needed
them and they're really really huge like
huge like on most of you they probably
would be like too big but on me like I
had a huge head so I feel like they kind
of like bounced out my face you know
okay so I was like from Nordstrom but
then from bloomingdales it is really
funny Tasha it has this purple sweater
for now I have like I have like five of
them there oh really I'm over there yeah
oh oh wait you haven't grade two or is
it like a purple hi ray I have five I
have purple grey teal light teal I have
a lot so basically they're like so cute
and I've always loved them whenever
Tasha wears them and I would always try
to find them in a free people store but
I think they just like don't sell them
anymore because they sold them like
probably a little while ago and then we
found them at Bloomingdale's well
actually
Tasha did she's a crush and I found it
and I was like so excuse it up right
away it just raised the register like
bought the black one and it's so cute
it's just this long sweater like it's so
long and just comfy like the material is
just so soft in it and it's like
stretchy so it's so comfy and then after
I bought that one Tasha is like I found
it in cream and I was like I'm gonna get
that one Jim and I just scooped it up
and when I bought this one so yeah I
just really like these I think they're
really flattering but go to plugins you
can just throw it on called the venture
a thermal in case you oh really yeah I
name yeah so good Oh bro Nordstrom I
also bought a pair of sunglasses and
I've
I'm sorry I'd have a sunglasses
obsession oh yeah but I realize that I
only get tortoise color into sunglasses
are like sunglasses with bright colored
lenses and I realized I never had a
black pair so I got some great bands
also on sale but only by $10 and worth
it I don't have a style but they're just
these black kind of circle lenses ones
they're kind of circling and they look
like this and then I got this body suit
from bloomingdales to wear to the style
hall photo shoot that we went to and
then they made me change and then we
didn't even really care what we wore and
ours a body suit and it's just all
crochet to the front which is super
pretty and then the back is all open and
what I liked about it is it's a thong a
body suit and I feel like most body
suits aren't thongs so you can't wait
tight pants with them when I was looking
onto our lines
well that's social yeah so I like that
this one's like a song one so there's no
underwear lumps thank you I love and
everyone is asking my blog they're like
where's Tasha's open-back shirt from and
you probably just hit knows about it too
so that's that if you were wondering
then we're going to show you this stuff
from the shop which is Tasha's favorite
store case you didn't know it's in
Melrose and they have the cutest stuff
and now it's like one of my favorite
stores I like love it it's like a
boutique so they sell a lot of like
brands I think honey punch
yeah Johnny punch I know they have it
urban I have a bunch of dresses from Mac
if you guys know me and Tasha actually
both Abby - it's like a cry honey punch
dress that just has like a nod rehearing
ties and everyone like loves having
money in black but I just found this one
which is like similar and it has a bunch
of little knots right there if you can
tell and yeah I just like you it's just
his five t-shirt dress and I'm all about
t-shirt dresses because they are just so
comfy and then I got this for Lucy which
is so cool and I really hope that you
like it Lou and it's just this really
distressed like vintage so cool you buy
like denim jacket and it's so sick it's
so heavy and just like amazing and I was
talking to the guy who like works
there's like yeah you can just go at it
for hours and I distress these jackets
and what is really cool is that they're
batik they sell it at like a wholesale
price so like it's so expensive because
it's like vintage but like basically
they sell it like
places on the East Coast which will jack
up the price like $160 you know what I
mean like a turbine okay I literally
bought this for beautycon because I
didn't really bring it out but that I
wanted to wear so I just bought one
there the day before but I got this
bralette which is one of those brats
that kind of has these straps in the
front it was kind of overpriced I didn't
have a price tag on it and then I
brought it up to the register and I
probably wouldn't about it but it looks
like you with the dress and it's kind of
silky looking and then the dress which I
think expired honey punch yes oh really
yeah
I love your dress it's plural I have
some like crochet stripe things I have
so many floral dresses like this but
what can you do I was gonna say that
then from Urban Outfitters I just got
this shirt which I know I kind of talked
about before you - you got it - yeah
Tasha showed me this place called the
wasteland in LA which is so cool it's
like a playlist closet if you guys know
what that is where people go install
their clothes and then you can buy them
but everything's either really cute and
trendy or it's designer you can find
some cool things there mm-hmm
I found this t-shirt and shorts this
like vintage really comfy light grey
t-shirt that says UCLA and I want it
obviously I don't go there but it's just
cool it smells good too
which is weird yeah that's like my foot
I didn't get anything from wasteland but
I have one thing from Dragon bone which
I didn't think I would ever buy anything
from Ragan book so expensive but these
jeans there were to me one hundred and
ninety-five dollars and I got them for
$60 because they were on sale and then
it was an additional 40% off they were
on sale for 160 is like what I paid for
my Topshop jeans yeah like the ones that
were normally but I didn't have a pair
of good white ones that aren't
see-through these are the kind of high
rise and then well I really like them if
they have a little bit plenty and then
they're supposed to be ankle jeans but
since I'm so short they're normal they
look so good on her - I'm so excited
I've wanted a pair of ragged one jeans
for so long and they were on sale the
last thing I have to show you is from
cotton on I just got these joggers or
kind of like a Heather like darker gray
with like black at the bottom on the
head
wrinkles in black like stretchy at the
top and I've been wanting a good pair of
joggers for a while and in my head I
always wanted ones that looks like these
and I found them from Topshop I got
these shorts but some people might think
are really ugly but for some reason I
really like them they're just
high-waisted denim shorts with some
floral embroidery nothing too special
but for some reason I really really like
them and the next thing from Topshop I
just said that I like Topshop jeans and
I wear them a lot and I've been wanting
these grey ones so I saw that they have
them and they're just there Jamie jeans
which are a high rise and then ankle
crop so they look like this and then
they have some grips yeah they're just
like a unique colour and I have black
and like dark wash denim so I thought
grey would be a nice addition proud of a
great at all I know definitely check out
