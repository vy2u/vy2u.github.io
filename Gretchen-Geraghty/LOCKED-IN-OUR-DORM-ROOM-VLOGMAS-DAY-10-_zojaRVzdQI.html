then I slept for like 4 hours and now
I'm gonna I think go work out again or
do homework or something look they're
dating everyone I ruin things you you're
dating or you like each other that was
so sweet it is because everyone has
stories similar to death what's the
question of the day I didn't ask one yet
do you like almonds or peanuts do you
like almonds or peanuts I used to be a
peanut girl no I like oh man I heard
almonds better almonds are the best
yeah they are I know comments better now
yeah one time me a ball gave me like

I don't know how to do this hey you have
to click the red button on the back to
make it stop on their blog miss big
things coming you always say that you
married oh wow what a beautiful day it
is the other day when it was like dark
right now like see how it's heating
darker I thought there's gonna be a
storm until I was like no Gretchen it
gets dark out early
say bye Gretchen okay everyone the
funniest thing ever just happened right
now okay so basically Taylor has really
bad habit where she always leaves her
key in the door I think she just doesn't
want to like lose it and put it
somewhere so she just leaves her key in
the door right and our RA and like
everyone I said like kill you can't
leave it there right so then just now
I'm like we're gonna focus and finish
our homework we're both like working on
our own chemistry assignment let's do
tonight and I can get someone to come
open it first Taylor asked Sasha to come
and open it okay but can you see me oh
yeah so I left my blog gamer in my room
this is with my phone
but I just thought it would be really
funny to remember this moment cuz now it
seems like a big deal but we'll be okay
basically Taylor me are stranded in this
room we're locked in here I can't
believe this happen because so like I
said I walk the door because I was like
we're gonna focus on our chemist I'm it
because I was like I'm gonna go wash my
hands cuz you just took off her nail
polish except she can't open the door
because the key is stuck in it but I
locked it so and now there's all sorts
of messed up going on in that door if
is so funny I can't believe we did this
it really won't open shake the door
handle wow that was like a fail of like
a vlogmas story I was like I was sure I
was gonna have like call sashing but can
you come like open the doors that we can
like escape that's so funny
now I guess you learned not to leave
your key in there except you probably
will still leave it there this is so
funny
okay so chemische ayman is going not so
good I keep getting distracted I think I
have issues of being distracted or any
of you like that doing your homework
probably all of you are like it's just
so hard to focus especially if you're
not like interested and it's like boring
you're just like oh I can't focus it's
stupid I don't care about bond formation
enthalpies you know what I'm saying

really pretty is it chinchilla that's
really stupid if I know that take it
outside okay

look like bubble gum
okay continue with our chemist anak
what's going on with my computer I don't
know there we go they've loved chemistry
chemistry that's a good time joke okay

was younger I like peanuts but almonds
are the way to go now

cream into my freezer and yeah currently
I'm just like in Taylor's room doing
we're both working on our time
assignment but I'm sitting out like her
rooming stuff so we can like I work
together you know cuz she sits right
over there and I'm here and I just wanna
let you guys know I tried a new Ben and
Jerry's flavor yesterday called um red
velvet cake or something it was so good
meeting the Chi I had already eaten like
a chocolate raspberry one so I only like
a couple bites of the red velvet one but
it was so good before I go I just want
to comment on the fact that Taylor and I
thought we were lasting earlier I
thought that was so funny
everything anything down but now I
forget everything you think you're
getting old
it's okay just I always read myself
reminders and notes on my phone I know
but I feel like I need like the other
day a sticky note on the door before
okay you're not supposed to remember
appointments that's why people have
planners and stuff no I gotta start
using one what you gotta do is try the
defendant Jerry's ice cream I'm about to
go get it's so good it's like red velvet
it's I'm gonna go get it now for reals
like I said I was going to before I was
laughing because
this angle makes me look like a little
kid or something you know when kids like
don't know what to do and they like put
the camera like this in their face I
don't know I just think it's funny
mmm yes
my papa let's declare follow me on
Spotify alright everyone this is a good
stuff I was telling you about it's just
the red velvet kind and it's so yummy
except just now when I was scooping it
out of the pride and Jerry's container I
broke two like plastic spoons these
thingies in the process because the ice
cream was so hard that was a really loud
noise I hurt my knee why you need to
take naps like me today was like my
first nap in a while look at everyone
and we've 18 left you can you drew those
except for psalms some takes so long
yeah and even knowledge check at the end

have Alex at your like high school or
whatever for chemistry it's awful like I
actually feel like it makes me learn a
lot but it's just like really hard yeah
sweep across me like crazy we're so bad
