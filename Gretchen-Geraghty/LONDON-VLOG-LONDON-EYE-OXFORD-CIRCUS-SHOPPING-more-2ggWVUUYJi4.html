I'm not complaining because we frickin
made it I don't even know how to say
this morning concisely I'm gonna try to
make it as quick as I can the title of
this video is going to be it's a
workhorse week of Lucy's life because it
literally is today I just did speaking
of her so she's gonna answer damn you
guys know I think I talked about it
before but she gets her wallet stolen
with her passport all credit cards all
debit cards all hash all IDs all their
drivers licenses hold her job and her
passport her Rabia everything's gone
right well she does have her phone comes
back to Paris her phone gets so on the
day before I get here then I get here
and the first night we go out I break
her wrist yeah everything is not well
okay so on top of that we're like
yesterday we're running around trying to
get her a calf because we were supposed
to take a train to London this morning
it's Friday so our train left at 7:45
and we were like hey we gotta get my six
ready we'll leave by seven takes like 15
minutes to get there great and by the
way like our like a third of the play of
the price of what the train is the
tunnel is like way expensive and takes
me longer than flights but we wanted to
do it because my dad my grandma was like
its historical you gotta do it oh my god
now my battery starting great so so we
wake up at 8:30 and we were like oh my
god like we missed our frickin train
right and we're like we need to go to
lunch and like to a reservation at Nobu
tonight
we have a hotel reservation seminarian
we're meeting up with friends like we
have to go to London like you planned
this all out so what do we do so I'm
like okay just look up the next train
tickets they'll be really expensive
because they already were before and
whatever we look up train tickets and
it's like to 85 euros a person
and we were like oh baby so then Lucy
looks at place and we find the flight
that leaves at 11:40 from Paris and mind
you were supposed to leave at 7:40 so
we're like missing half a day whatever
more like we have to go so we find a
play that leaves at 11:40 and we pay how
much for it it was like 150 euros a
person
yeah something on that I don't know how
much dollars in American 100% whatever
and we remind you our channel to be
quicker needed my do you remember she
loses her balance for an Amsterdam so to
leave Amsterdam she means either by
coming back there she has to get an
emergency passport from like the
American Embassy it took three days it
was like such a mess so she like comes
back to Paris way late missing her
internship whatever
so this he has an emergency passport but
yesterday when we go to the doctor's
office to get all X rating cats and
whatever the only ID she has is it her
person's new passport so the woman goes
oh yeah we have to hang on to this till
the end of the appointment you come back
and you like pay the bill you get your
emergency passport and then you can go
but when we leave yesterday Lucy pays
but they don't give her a passport and
we forgot about at this point we were
there for like five hours we were
running to go get my god because we had
to go to a different guy down the street
to get her cat who's 5 p.m. he was like
close ok whatever
so then this morning checking us in for
a flight that we have to leave Berlin at
that moment and we're like we don't have
Lucy's passport oh my god
so he my ride I would have another
yeah so we were like you know what like
everything works out kind of and we
would have ended up at the tunnel with
no ID
I have no password so we wouldn't been
able to get out anyway even if we did
wake up in time and we found out I set
in line for 6:30 and actually did go off
but only Lucy woke up she's like dead
tired cuz she doesn't sleep and like her
wrists bothering her like whatever so I
think she just like turned off the alarm
and fell back asleep so like whatever
it's fine it's fine everything worked
out right so then we like go
hiko on the metro to the doctor's office
that we went to yesterday and also her
phone's gone right I only have my phone
it doesn't work in Paris unless a black
light and we don't have Wi-Fi so we
don't really know what this doctor's
office gave a loss because we want to
see Tasha remembered we walked way too
far we walk away past it and I literally
almost started crying because I'm like
we are light is so soon that we booked
we're not gonna even make it like okay
so by the grace of God we don't move I
think the doctor the doctor stopped is
gonna run in here and we get Lucy's
passport and she goes you love to pay
your bill unless he's like no I paid
yesterday through wise yes she made
yesterday know yourself today and she's
like I can just take my credit cards
like we gotta get out of here so she
pays like for the third time but then I
asked her what's going to get to orally
and we don't know when to or leave the
doctor's appointment and then I was like
no this is wrong I never literally would
have one
right now so then we're like hey how'd
we get too early my phone somewhere
couldn't figure it out so we go the
Metro and we're bound to get on yet
we're about to get on the way that she
told us to go and this is like this is
it right I'm like and Lucy was way
writer and we got here my clicker okay
so we end up getting to Orly by like
three different trains at like 10:15 and
we're like nah we're chilling then we go
to check-in we wait in line for a half
ok my battery is renovated a half an
hour then we need to run and they tell
us that Prague life is like completely
booked or like another 10 minutes
