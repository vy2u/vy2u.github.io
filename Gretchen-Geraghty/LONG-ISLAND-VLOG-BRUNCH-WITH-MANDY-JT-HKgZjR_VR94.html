reason why derp oh yeah they're good

just gonna play with my emotion or to
feel you up you have to you like a
really big what I feel like
I would have to say to them this is so
funny Julia I feel like we're like okay
obviously night but I think we're more
on the same level but then on I vlog I
just noticed that your head isn't even
in the trees okay when I talk to them I
forgot what I had to say to the bug
maybe I don't like how sure my arms all
right is it good oh I actually do have
something to say it's a recommendation
my hair is naturally curly and I like
straighten it all the time because I
hate my curly hair and I'm not like them
they need to know and they're just like
nothing was working for me he's so like
I was just like whatever like I'm just
gonna straighten it all the time like
this is my legs she decided to get away
so then I was like on Instagram I saw
this ad for like growing your hair on my
hair like never grows because it's like
Dettol they're trying to get ad yes and
it's dead all the time so it just like
doesn't grow via straighten it but I saw
an ad for this like hair supplement and
it's called keratin j ER OPI anyone
knows I thought it was kera no it's a
different it's a different color
especially it's not good and it's like a
pill has changed from it so I recommend
that if your hair like doesn't really
grow I think it's really cool there
woman like I love trouble growing their
hair but I use it and I think it's
working so I'd recommend it if you had
that problem
