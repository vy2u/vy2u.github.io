very good I feel like it's morning
because we you know slept like 11 we're
back we're back I might buy the same bag
that maggie has we won't see I might
need it
we just mind money to buy a bag that bag
she looks awful and it's Shogun like
but I knew that's right like stores like
disappeared about blocking they are but
we're in the Louboutins tour I keep
saying like we were talking believe it's
a Louboutin we're in the Louboutins or
my mom thought they were Louie Vuitton
shoes I'm like it's a no vote on mom
get it right so I might be buying the
same bag is not good you will see it is
so impulsive like I might need it no
I'll use it yet like you wouldn't
telling last week with a battery pack
yeah yeah okay guys how I literally
can't hold it my arm it's like 80 pounds
but it's in there it's really cute this
is a cute spot I would say it's nice and
cool toned we're just like the same
person in so many ways like our clothes
fit each other we are both an eight and
a half we just have the same like taste
I don't know our personalities are quite
similar and like how we view like
relationships I don't know we're just
like the same and I miss her and I love
her and hopefully oh I think I mentioned
this earlier I think she's gonna come on
spring break with me and a vg7 Florida
because she is the same spring Ric is
ultra sit which is so fun and I got to
show you guys really quick because so
Maggie came here with her Louie Vuitton
duffel bag and I was like I'm obsessed I
need that so guess what we did today
we're taught to choose like Gretchen
like you just go right now and get it
and I was like okay so we did it oh my
god it's so happy you're on the Gucci
bag right now yesterday sorry I sound so
basic right now but look at how cute
these are
I was gonna wear these during the day
today but it was really icy and salty
and snowy so I'm just wearing them right
now to try to like break them in before
I go to Paris oh and this what I just
got from urban like to date sites just
so cute and I love it oh wait do you
guys remember I also got it in black
recently because I have you had it in
black so that I got it black in this
Shelby when we were no
Tessa get shelving love you receive and
she was wearing the gray one and I was
like I need the gray one
wait should this just been a little
quick hole okay so then also from urban
my friend Annie
you guys don't Lisa it's like her friend
Annie and then so I'm gonna tie met
Annie and I love Annie
so cute pink shoes wearing at this top
and we went out on Thursday and it was
just like the cutest thing and you guys
I have a bunch of shirts in this style
that are like short sleeve and long
sleeve and they just go really deep
because I love like the plunging
neckline you feel and then it just like
ties in the wall bow in the front and
she was bringing it in this gray like a
bill everyone and I was like oh my gosh
I need that so you get the whole screen
there's like a Louie Vuitton a little
ribbon this is this is like a little
impulsive but not really because I
actually haven't look everyone I always
thought it was so cute and Matty was
like Gretchen you need to get it now
you're going to Paris on Tuesday it's
like the perfect like carry-on things
I'm like you know what you're so right
so this is going to be perfect for
traveling if you're wondering it's the
oh my gosh I totally forget what it's
called but I know there's a 45 to 50 and
a 55 and this is the biggest one this is
a 55 and Maggie says that you need the
55 because it'll be like perfect it's
like a perfectly begin bag to hold all
your stuff like she had it when she came
here just now but again when it comes to
like a little walk and clean also I know
and I just got the I knew there's like
different prints you could get probably
or you know that you know they're never
full tote bag that I have police smell
so nice and new and it's like the gray
and the white checkered one I think they
have it either in that or you know in
the tan and the brown checkers they
definitely have it in that I thought of
that but this one I just thought was so
cute I didn't have anything in the
classic
Elvie will print or I also got it with
the long strap because I think it just
comes with like the short straps like
this but then you buy the long strap
with it because Maggie was like you
really need the long strap cause it gets
so heavy when you pack it full of things
so then you want the long strap so that
it doesn't like kill your arms what I
mean and this thing is like big guys
like it's gonna fit like all your stuff
in it to me perfect like a carry on like
a suitcase I'm gonna be in the Paris for
like almost two weeks so I'm gonna need
like a lot of stuff it was like you just
so cute I just want to talk really quick
so I don't want this to come off in the
wrong way at all I don't like when
people are like oh you're like Shelley
you're like show off or any of that like
I'm so not about that like I truly just
think it's like so cute and my beautiful
and like obviously amazing quality and
Maggie was talking about like buying
nice things tonight and I like so agree
with everything she was saying and like
it's really good to invest in some just
like a couple pieces that are like
really nice that will last you forever
she's like this will literally last you
forever like you'll be like a really
cute mom like traveling with your duffel
bag it'll just last you for so long you
know instead of buying like a bunch over
the course of like 20 years at all like
break or like wear out or rip you know I
mean so it's good to like invest in like
long-term things that will last you a
while and like these for example these
shoes I still don't think I don't if I
showed you guys in depth but I just
thought the plain black Gucci I don't
know if they're called like a loafer
like slippers but I've had my eyes on
these for a while like just like this
bag to mine yesterday when I went to the
Gucci store I was like we just have to
do it because for question one for
business school like people like dress
up pretty much like every day and these
will be like perfect and like obviously
look like they're like professional line
stuff I feel like just going forward
like for my professional life they'll be
really good and I think they're like
really stylish and can make any other
look we put together and like those from
your life me Probert you know like
really nice like leather things so yeah
that's all I just remember oh oh my gosh
