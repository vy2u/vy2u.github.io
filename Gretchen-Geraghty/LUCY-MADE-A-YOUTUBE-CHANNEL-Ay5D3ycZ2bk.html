all right guys so today Lucy and I have
a really really big announcement for you
and we're so excited to share it with
you Lucy and I have decided to for
making a vlog channel together yay and
I'm so so excited for this you guys have
been asking me forever to make a vlog
channel and you've been asking her
forever to make her own channel so we
decided to just squish those two
together after the summer there's no
guarantees on what's going to happen to
that channel
it may just become my vlog channel oh I
see how it goes we'll see
yeah if Lucy doesn't want to like keep
blogging and if I haven't already said
and obviously go subscribe I will have
the link to our vlog channel down below
we might just share the long channel
like forever
it's gonna be so fun to have Lucy like
be a part of it too because as you guys
know she's been on so many of my videos
for the past four years for probably the
full four years people have been asking
her to make her own channel as well and
so the other part of this video is not
only are we making a vlog channel
together for at least the summer but
probably after that as well but also we
have made for the past couple of days a
summer bucket list for the summer of
2016 and my idea a bucket list is just
you write down to everything you want to
do and we write down things you want to
do before you die but I guess I'm not
really thinking it's things we want to
do before we die just things we want to
do this summer we picked 100 things over
the past couple days we thought very
very hard and we're excited to share
them all with you right now so you will
have an idea of what is to come in our
summer months of vlogging because come
to think of it we will be home from
college very very soon and we will have
essentially almost four full months of
summer which is creative we've never had
that one with summer yeah absolutely
can't wait so it's gonna be so great
just like share all these memories of
you and sorry like right now my feels I
keep talking just cuz I'm used to like
always talking in my videos
so like I said for the past couple days
we have compiled a list of 100 things on
our bucket list that we are going to be
doing this summer and we thought - that
each vlog will probably incorporate
maybe one or two maybe even three
different things off the bucket list
we're gonna try to get every single one
done with we can't guarantee daily vlogs
every day over our function what we will
be posting very very very frequently
like probably most days probably every
day we might skip a day or two or three
and combine some like bucket list things
that we're doing like it maybe into one
vlog but yeah we will be posting very
very frequently so keep your eye out for
that and before further adieu we're just
going to start reading off the 100 list
of things for our bucket list so that's
me the rest of this video I just want my
nose so now it's really red okay that's
weird the first one I actually can't
tell you what it is which I know stinks
but it's going to be a big surprise that
Lucy and I will like get into later in
the summer so I can't really like say it
yet but it can be really exciting and
we're just gonna start with number two
there's it a barn and a pool number
three go hiking at a lake go hiking at a
melon visit a beach go to a local
concert is it an island swim across the
lake walk around a lake by tennis is it
