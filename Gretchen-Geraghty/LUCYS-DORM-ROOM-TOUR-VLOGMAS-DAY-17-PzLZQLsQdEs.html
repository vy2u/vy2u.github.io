nose and two eyes
good morning abbey vlogmas day wait 17
oh it is the 17th because I'm going on
my fig I said every day I'm like wait is
it but I actually can't believe it's the
17 I literally woke up like 10 or 15
minutes ago at 11 oh it's 11:40 now
because Justin FaceTime me 11 it was
like you need to wake up and study for
your Kevin final because my cam final is
at 6:00 today and I was like no I can't
believe you woke me up because I stayed
up till 5:00 a.m. last night just
packing and like cleaning my room like
getting ready to leave so like if you
see all that on the ground
this bag is mostly stuff that I'm
bringing home for the winter that stuff
is mostly in that very Bradley baguette
stuff I'm like bringing to Aruba
and then my computer charlie the clothes
I'm wearing today och boats and then
that dirty clothes bag is like all the
dirty clothes I have to bring home and
wash so yeah that took me forever and
then I organize my closet more I know
you can't really tell like that is not
organized that part is never going to
organize but then this I can like it's
so weird I can like actually move
clothes around because before I couldn't
do that it would just be like stuck
because I had so many and yeah I decided
to make like my first like all of that
used to be food but then I decided to
make that like clothes so it like freed
up some more space yeah and basically I
can't believe I'm like leaving today but
now I'm packed so I'm like that stressed
out that I'm just kind of worried about
my chem final and I have to like eat up
on my food that's in my dorm room since
we're leaving for a month so I'm eating
the end of my favorite yogurt ever which
I already showed I feel like eight
million blogs but this it's literally
the best year ever and it's like
yesterday I thought it was yo play but
really it's Dan enlightened fit and then
I put honey bunches on top and I saw the
bunch of these so hopefully I'm just
gonna be able to bring food home with me
and yeah I should probably get ready now
because I know I look like Vicki wasn't
that so funny which other never doing
those face masks last night I thought we
like so funny I'm still not over the
fact that I deleted the first clip of
vlogmas yesterday I'm so obsessed but
yeah I can't believe I'm going home
today I finally get to leave bu like no
like I love bu I really do love it here
but I just like obviously like miss my
friends and my family and like it's my
first semester being in college so I'm
super excited to go home and tell her at
Christmas and there's a rubout people
asking about a robot I'm just going with
Justin and family for two weeks and I'm
gonna vlog maybe three or four times
when I'm there just because I want to
like live in the moment and look of
course I'll take pictures and stuff but
I'm not gonna like pressure myself to
like vlog every day when I've just been
doing vlogmas and it's been taking over
my life so don't get me wrong I love
lachman's it's just like a really big
commitment so I don't deal with that for
doing so vacation I know isn't able do
like everyday vlogs when they're on
vacation but like I'm not gonna do that
I know I'm gonna vlog the day I leave so
that would be cool because you can see
like my first like reaction because I've
never been to Aruba so I'm like so so
excited and then yeah I just look a
couple other days and are doing fun
stuff are you ready now I need breakfast
and I'm going to study some more can
show everyone I finally put some clothes
on and got ready except really I just
put on some face powder and some blush
but Taylor and I are going to go study

gonna bring blogs with me because I
really need to focus will be on the car

actually I don't want this right now do
we look like everyone yeah everyone so
everyone it feels so good to be home I
like can't believe that it's already
like Christmas time and we're home hey
it's actually technically December 18th
now because it is 1208 and vlogmas day
16 is uploading right now and I feel
really funny in glasses still I can't
really get used to this but I don't have
to wear them all the time if I didn't
like explain into it well enough these
are really just for like up close when
I'm reading or like I told my eye doctor
about like how I'm literally always on
my computer like editing YouTube videos
and stuff so I'm doing stuff up close it
kind of messes up like the focus of my
eyes did I mention this before I feel
like I did but basically it can just
like mess up like the focus of your eyes
and can kind of get locked into like
looking really up close so these are
just to help my eyes when I'm doing
things up close so that when I take them
off I'm I can see like far distances
because I actually have really really
good like far distance vision like
better than 20/20 I can still see like
far really really well I can always like
read things on papers like across the
room I've always been like good at that
but I will just need these for up close
so yeah sorry today's vlog miss wasn't
as exciting as other ones I know it was
just me being like I'm not wanting to do
it cuz I'm starting for good blah blah
blah but yeah I'm really happy we're
home I did upload three videos today
