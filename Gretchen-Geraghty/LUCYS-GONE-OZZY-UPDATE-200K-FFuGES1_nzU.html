best one and I was like you can pricing
this one was so big I couldn't even get
my lips all good morning guys how are
you doing today
mm-hmm oh you look good the mailman just
came and honest he was not happy about
it he was very upset right Ozzy who
would have thought the mailman was a
total intruder probably was freaking out
basically well now it's like cloudy eyes
you can't even tell but it's like sunny
out right now actually this one's just
behind the clouds so I'm just lying on
my drive a tanning with Ozzy gave me
company and as you guys know little
update he's like pretty sick and I
actually haven't given this update yet
because it's just like really hard for
me to talk about and like not easy to
say on camera at all but I mean I have
to go - well I'm looking ready oh okay
okay
I just can't talk about that things
about okay guys know when I was New York
I like broke the bad news that the tumor
and then they were gonna do a bunch of
tests and biopsies to see like it was
cancerous and yes he has cancer but it's
okay he's already at like pretty much
the max abut great Dayton slip anyway so
he's had like a long happy life he lived
away longer than our last Great Dane
likes because Lex got below that's
actually what Marley got Marley and me
if you guys think this will be he died
on a third birthday which still like
breaks my heart if so is that like I get
to hold a like new baby out do I like
woke up with my hair is all dirty yeah
just like the running bathing suit a
size a tan but yeah he basically is
inside all day cuz you can't like get
around that well anymore cuz he has a
pretty big tumor on his shoulder and now
it's kind of spreading back near his
stomach I don't even know if I should
show you but um
like right there shoulders really
enlarged and then right there that's
where it's kind of spreading back but
yeah he's doing the best he can there's
the Sun but he's not too much pain
the doctors say and he's taking a lot of
medicine and I actually brought out his
food and put it on that Gatorade been
this morning because he like when he's
like in one spot like I said he can't
like move around that well so we took
him outside to his bathroom and I just
popped out in the in the grass I just
like am staying out here with him and
then we like I got to put his food on so
that he could hear hear but it's hard
for him to eat so we like have to making
me look as much as he can but he's still
like isn't that good eating so I just
had to bring in the rest of his food
inside anyway I don't want to make you
guys that good why is me crying in vlogs
like a big I don't know basically like
if you guys have a dog you know or if
you've had dogs but that's like it's so
hard I'm like her mean we've got Ozzie
for like 10 years I'm like I'm like if
he goes that's like my whole child do
you know what I mean so I know it's just
hard but I've also heard people say that
you shouldn't be sad around your dogs if
they're like a shaker
anything like that because then they
feel more sad so I need to be happy okay
then I was like really think about it
talk about it then I get really
emotional because he's my Isaac oh
basically I like haven't been good with
blogging the past couple days
I just wanted to vlog like over two
weeks and put it into one video but
today is Monday Oh Lucy left Saturday to
go to Paris and that was so hard to I
was also like an emotional wreck because
I like once here like three and a half
months except I will probably visit so
I'll see her then but you know it's
still really hard when you're sick
that's broad she's like obviously
everything I go back to school on
Saturdays my mate oh my god it's like a
couple days away I gotta like get to
packing and stuff
that's a lousy update he isn't going to
be getting better but we are just
enjoying all the time with him that we
have yeah I can he's still in good
spirits you know he can't tolerate
everything we can tell whenever we come
home he still wags his tail like crazy
because he gets so excited to see us
oh that's my buddy good morning guys
so obviously I'm like smiling so big
right now because I'm so happy I just
got my hair done if you couldn't tell
look so much blonder and I'm so happy
about it because my roots were like a
million inches long I just couldn't
handle it anymore I actually wanted to
vlog before this you could see I could
before and after but I took like two
little pictures that quickly while I was
in there because I didn't have time to
vote before but as you could tell from
the pictures if you couldn't my roots
were like probably out to like there
they were like crazy and I'm the type of
person I just like don't realize until
one day I look in the mirror and I'm
like well why should get these down and
then I like text you I'm like come on I
feel like I need to see you like I'm
dying
um but yeah it looks so good I'm so
obsessed I'm actually still right out
front right now if you guys don't know I
see chill out ambience in latham she's
the best go to her she will like fix
your hair and make it look awesome
there's Taylor I was waiting for her
because I have a headboard to gift her
so just ran into Taylor she had to run
into ambience because she gets her hair
done there too and that's actually how I
found the place so she had to run in
because they just kiss her Nellie quick
so I just had to move my headboard that
I'm giving to her because I'm actually
can have a full bed FPU this year was
just so exciting and you guys will see
like my move-in vlog and like room tour
and everything with it but so I'm giving
her my headboard and then I had to
return one of her little shelving things
that I borrowed in New York City this
summer and then she had to keep me back
when you know you're out of shape anyway
so yeah hair awesome so good Jill was
like wow I can't believe like my hair
grow is pretty quick and my roots get
pretty bald pretty quick but she fixed
up real nice and oh my get it straight
when I leave but I was like you can just
do some of these curdles
mmm yeah I love it anyway so now I think
I'm in a run to the grocery really quick
because we're talking about squash when
I was getting my hair done I think I
just love going to jail because I get so
excited to just like talk to her because
we have the best conversations which I
feel is quash and I was like wow I
really want a corn squash and there's a
grocery store right back that way so I'm
gonna get some acorn squash my dad wants
pizza dough to make pizza I think so I'm
gonna go get squash pizza dough sweet
eight coins for just got pizza dough for
my dad you're welcome daddy
dang it Teddy I forgot to vlog at the
dog park how do you look at your fans
okay okay
hey you freaking out because my dad just
figured she's sorry
Oh sweetie it's okay daddy
kind of not hey so guys I just finished
editing at this vlog and I'm really
sorry that it was obviously all over the
place but I just kind of needed to just
spend the time that I was home at the
very end of the summer like packing and
getting ready for college spending time
with my family because I really didn't
see them all that much summer soon as
you guys know I was in New York City
most of the summer I'm like traveling
like San Francisco in LA and everything
actually deleted the end of this will
hug the last clip so I was firm enough
laughter and I actually mentioned that
I'm selling a bunch of my clothes on a
Poshmark with Lucy - so yeah not all of
them are why not all the my Lucy's what
we kind of like shared both post on
there and some clothes aren't even that
old some clothes might have even been
clothes that were sent to me recently I
bought recently some clothes that are
sent to me like I know some gym jerk
ones I got a lot of doubles actually
like two of the same things so then I
would sell the second one you know
because why would I need two of the same
pair of leggings or like shirts or
whatever so that's why there's a lot of
gym jerk on there and then clothes that
I bought recently or whatever if they
just don't fit me right or something
like that like I don't have the room
here in college to keep it all so that's
why Lucy an Irish thing a bunch of
Poshmark and then you know she's in
Paris right now so she obviously does
not have a lot of room to bring a lot of
closer so that's why she was selling a
lot of stuff on there as well and yeah
basically I just wanna let you guys know
that we are just trying to revert with
clothes and we want you guys to have
them if you want them and I like really
don't know how to price them at all Lucy
and I don't know how like we're both
doing it and if they're like really high
really low like sorry like if you don't
know we're doing but basically just like
leave offers on anything because we'll
probably accept them because yeah we
want you guys to have the clothes that
you like of ours so you know what I mean
and if like we don't accept them for any
reason maybe it's cuz it's like a dollar
like extremely low or maybe because like
Lucy not aren't on the same page so I
just want to throw that out there but
yeah definitely check out some clothes
and Poshmark
in case you want new clothes for like
fall season and stuff cuz i have so much
on there my username is just scratching
with five ends and then I know you can
use this code for like five dollars off
your first order I'm pretty sure yeah
thank you guys so much for watching at
this vlog and stay tuned for my next
vlog where I'm moving to college alright
love you guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
