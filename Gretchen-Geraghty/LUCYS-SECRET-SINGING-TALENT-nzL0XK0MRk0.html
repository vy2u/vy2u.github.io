say happy vlogmas this is so weird if
you're so funny to just be like vlogging
in my everyday life and have it like not
be vlogmas but I decided that I would
vlog today and this is actually kind of
starting late in the day it's already
like 250 I just checked the time and I
was dressed at the Y okay I'm leaving
wearing my white shirt I was at the
white with Lucy and we worked out for a
while we like ran for a long time and
lifted but then I just came back here
because I really wanted to and they
don't have works there so I'm just gonna
go downstairs and work for a little bit
I thought it'd be fun to vlog today
because Lucy and Taylor and I are going
out to like really fancy dinner later
and it's my Christmas present to them
and maybe I'll try to vlog there a
little bit except for I've been there
once before it's like really fancy so I
feel like uncomfortable vlogging in
there and it's like really dark so I
don't know how well that I'll work out
I'll try to vlog a little bit maybe show
you guys the food because the food I
remember was like so so good like
there's these two desserts I'll talk
about them later
they're like insane oh my gosh this
morning I wish I started vlogging
earlier I'm really sorry so Hannah and
Taylor slept over last night and this
morning we made remember cinnamon rolls
that you can just buy with the dough in
those packs and they put them in the
fridge and you're supposed to cook them
in the oven to make cinnamon rolls but
instead we put them in the waffle maker
and made like cinnamon roll waffles
they're like they just come out like
little and like waffle form and you just
feel like the icing on top of them and
they're so good I'll insert a picture
right here they were like so good I put
a picture my Instagram wait also for
clarifications sake I've noticed a lot
of comments on my two instagrams because
I have two instagrams and some of you
are like this is Rebecca land this is
her real one who's this blah blah blah
and people like you like confuse and
stuff and I mentioned this like before
but I know I'll enter new subscribers
like all the time so I'll just mention
it I do have two instagrams and it
started off as Gretchen last video was
just my YouTube one and then Gretchen
it's Gretchen with five ends at the end
is my personal one you could follow that
one too if you don't already
um and so it was my personal one that I
just had for awhile just for me and my
friends like back home and like in high
school and stuff a bunch of my YouTube
subscribers undefined
it just because they would follow like
my friends and my friends have all my
personal one and like tag my personal
Instagram you know like it's mixed up
like that and I have like 7000 like
requests and I was like okay I'm just
gonna make it public like I don't really
care so I decided to just keep both
because I know a bunch of people like
from my hometown followed me on my
personal one and I'm gonna like allow
them to still follow my Instagram and
not just be my like beauty fashion like
YouTube on you know so yes I do have two
instagrams Gretchen loves beauty is my
like more YouTube one and I feel like I
post more on that one and then Gretchen
with five ends it's more of my personal
one but I guess it's public matter too
so I just kind of have two instagrams
and also sorry I've so many pimples on
my face right now I got back from Aruba
like two or three days ago
I know I mentioned this in some video
before but I'll just mention again I had
really a lot of trouble with my skin in
the past and it always gets better no
matter what like in the Sun like in the
summer I was that really good skin or if
I go on vacation or he's really sunny
like somewhere tropical like Aruba my
skin got really really good cuz I feel
like just my skin gets tan and Alps get
rid of pimples like it's salt water and
Sun like it just helps get rid of them
but now that I've been home for three
days guess he like broke out like crazy
yesterday me because my skin's like
where is the Sun that it's used to
there's no more Sun so then I break out
but yeah anyways I have to go finish my
workout I have a video uploading right
now it's a winter haul video with some
shoes that I got from Steve Madden and
I'm really excited for that to upload
because that's like a really fun video
and I like all the stuff I got and this
video is obviously I'm home right now
for a winter break and Lucy and I will
be going back early next week we start
class today after Martin Luther King's
day at Boston University I gotta go
finish working out maybe I'll show you a
little bit of new yorking it's not too
embarrassing so guys I wanted to show
you a little setup in our basement burg
and then I will have my water and then I
have on this little table
conveniently I put my phone next to this
speaker that I got for Christmas and I'm
like so happy I got it I didn't even
realize i would use it so much for
airing but like I always do because I
don't know I'm like I always run with
headphones in and it's fine but on
or like it's okay but you don't really
have anyone to put your phone so I
always like put it in my sports bra but
then my phone would get all sweaty and
you know I just like earning and having
music like out loud so it's really nice
to have this speaker and also I wanted
to show you I'm playing Lucy's Spotify
playlist called steady state urging and
you guys should follow her on Spotify
it's just Lucy Garrity and then you can
also follow me if you want to Gretchen
Garrity but her playlists are better not
gonna lie and she has so many songs
instead he's saying that like I like
never get sick of it and I can always
listen to it and because it's always
like a new song there's probably like a
hundred something so yeah I just like
shuffle that and like urgh for a while
and maybe I'll like fill me a little bit
at the end I don't know maybe after I'm
done or something I'll take a couple
strokes so you can see but I'm just
gonna work out
I hope that was interesting in some sort
of way I turned on the camera for a
little bit and I was so tired I'm not so
tired I'm tired but I was so hot I had
to take off my shirt I was literally
like I'm dying so if you wondered what
that weird black strapless it's just my
heartrate monitor like that in the back
and I just used it when I workout mostly
it misses a pole or watch I have I know
people have asked before so just looks
like that and now I gotta go pick up
Lucy from the gym because she is still
there since we were there earlier but I
came back to earth and I didn't even
hurt for as long as I wanted to because
my back started bothering me so that's
no fun but we're gonna go get Lulu now
my baby would you watch me bleed until I
can't breathe uh kuchen can't even say
it
song has been on the radio for the
couple million years now thanks I'm good
always on the radio too
I'm not mad about it not like a big pop
music thing except for that's fire guys
does this remind you of log mess from
last year because it reminds me I feel
like it's like back when we were in high
school and would sing in the car all the
time together and drive around I like
Miss this Eppie you you know yeah
dancing right now yeah
Lucy me the sweet potatoes yesterday but
then we never ate that because we were
too full so now I'm heating it up and it
looks so good in the really soft because
the primaries I'm excited and I think
why don't I happen she does it so that's
that it's better I'm on half it's
probably a really good post-workout
snack when I'm to think yeah and I like
my sweet potatoes with salt and pepper
and butter and Lucy just likes pepper so
I think the last time I've logged was
when Lucy and I were oh yeah we were
eating sweet potatoes after we worked
out and we shower and got ready and now
it's like almost 7:30 a.m. scary like
you wait for a reservation and I
straighten my hair myself and I'm
wearing this new necklace that I showed
in a haul video that's still uploading
that I talked about earlier on at Kate
Spade and Taylor got it for me and Lucy
for Christmas and I love it um I'm super
excited because this restaurant
seriously so yummy and yeah if you guys
know like where I'm from and if you have
been there you probably know what I'm
talking about it's like the nicest
restaurant around in my opinion and I
mean this dress that I think is from
Toby baby yeah I need some Toby and it
goes really really deep right there so
you have to wear
oh and by the way I don't even think I
mentioned this but this dinner is like
my well one of my Christmas presents to
Lucy and Taylor because they're some of
my best friends and I wanted to take
that on a special dinner date just put
on my coat we're literally leaving like
right now and look at the shoes I'm
wearing these I also showed in the haul
video
they're from Madden girl like how
beautiful are these oh they're so cute
and I never really wear heels because
I'm honestly with them I'm probably like
six foot six one because I'm like five
nine as it is like I'm like so so so
tall I don't mind because I think
they're really cute and yeah I'm hungry
and I'm excited to eat good food I'll
check in with you guys there but I
probably won't be able to get like that
much footage and I should be enjoying
the company of Lucy Taylor oh my gosh
they probably miss you from vlogmas
today good morning and then I was about
to say like heavy walking to say
whatever and like it wasn't walking okay
guys look at these menus
they're like so awesome me too what to
get every restaurant needs to have these
menus thank God we didn't order more
than one because so big it's so dark you
can barely see right now it's worth it
they look so good tonight love that
sauce and they come in Taylor got the
same in which I had before seriously so
good and Lucy got a chopped salad which
also look to it so I'm really excited
this is all I've been dreaming about
dinner was so so fun it was really good
and it was so good oh it's pretty you
guess we did those bronzer in her blush
me and she's like oh my god it's so much
it is every day I usually look like
Palin girl oh I know you don't want pale
you look and no I know I'm definitely
time to remember but but like no the
bronzer looks so bad yeah I know I've
done a lot but it like blended well
looks nice thank you it's like a
plunging neckline this is like an actual
punching neckline in that one this will
just kind of open it up yeah yeah and I
am I just like a little bit of footage
there and it was really dark Lucy I just
took a photo shoot in front of our
Christmas tree because we don't want to
let it go like I did not want to get rid
