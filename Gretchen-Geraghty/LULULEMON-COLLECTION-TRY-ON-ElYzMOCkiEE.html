lemon collection it's our little lemon
collection video and this isn't it so so
request it's kind of ridiculous how much
lemon we have but big disclaimer we
really like working out we work out all
the time we enjoy wearing little lemon
when we work out so it makes sense for
us when you say qualities yeah the
quality is really good I also want to
mention that I left a bunch of my
Lululemon stuff back at bu so I don't
have it here with me to show you now
then I'll just like try it on in this
video so that's why some things I can't
actually show up and hold you but it'll
just me me trying it on mom talking
about it you know and I'd also be in
this video so we have a lot of stuff to
show you and we better jump into it so
this video isn't so on this is probably
gonna be such a long video but first
things we're going to show you is sports
bras whoo sports bras first because I
think I have a lot of that and they're
really colorful the first one I have is
just this royal blue why sports bra I
also have it and it's like sunset mix of
colors I would say it's like purple
orange coral and I have it in this mint
green color saying why type I really
like this one probably one of my
favorites this is the same why I type of
sports bra it's like like right with
darker in the bottom in lime green strap
so why sports bras are one of my
favorite type they're just like really
cute and simple uncomfortable and these
are probably my next favorite type they
are the wild type bras and Fraser so the
free to be wild ones are like this
they're all crisscross E in the back and
I just love that if I want to wear one
that you can like really see my sports
bra under tank top or something I'll
wear these months I also got it in this
pink color because I couldn't decide
between the Gormley think they're kind
of similar and then I just have this
light orange one that has the prettiest
printed straps in the back I also have
it in just plain black and I just have
this normal free to be black sports bra
it was the first one I ever got from
there then this one is called the energy
bra it's a light purple in dark purple
striped
sports bra and I just have this lime
green sports bra in this one's cool
because again eight
criss-cross is in the back but they're
like thick criss crossing I have this
one it's really cool strike
I like how has the highlighter color
coral straps none I like how it has like
different colored like straps in the
back like with the white and there's
like a solid green and then like the
printed and then Lucy just has this
orange sports bra that has pink straps
and it's like really crisscross II in
the back now I'm Gretchen I have a seams
towards bra she got it for me yeah I
really like this one twinsies and this
one is like AB to Street one it
literally matches the pants that I have
I love those pants and I have this
fourth row it's the same one that
Gretchen has really like how it's like
adjustable in the back then moving on to
tank tops yeah my favorite types of tank
tops from women swiftly Tech I think
it's weird at all and it's just really
like breathable and good when you're all
sweaty the person I have is just this
dark gray one then I have it in this
light pinkish purple color this one's
just so pretty and I have it also in
like this darker purple color and I also
have it in this white color this one I
got like so long ago and I just found it
in my drawer I have it morning in
forever because I kind of forgot about
it the straps kind of look weird in the
back to me I don't really know they just
look kind of funny that's why I don't
wear it as much oh this was one of my
first ones
it's just his black tank top the straps
are like a lot thicker and then the back
has just this one and simple like strap
and it's mesh I have this black one the
straps are a little skinnier it also has
like removable pads and then the back
just looks like that there's like a
little mesh spot in the middle I copied
my friend Emily Emily if you're watching
this it's cuz I copied you I also have
this black tank top but the back is so
cool I love how it's all open and you
can kind of like see your skin this one
I got recently it's just this coral like
ribbed really stretchy like soft tank
top I have this white tank top also this
is like the power Y tank top I know it's
called it just has like a white like
that in the back and then I have the
white tank in this mint green color and
sorry I forgot to try on the white one
and said oh I mean the other size is
pretty much more like twos and fours and
everything it kind of like depends like
this I gotten it too it's pretty tight
whereas like this is a 2 and it's not
that tight this black ones a 4 so it
really just depends like most of my
sports bras are tubes because I don't
oops everything is basically just oozing
for so for reference we're usually like
smalls in normal things I would say that
a tuna for reference is probably is like
a small normally yeah in work five nine
five eight so yeah so you know this is
just this maroon color and it kind of
has thin straps and the back looks like
that I like really really like this one
it's like though coral and Gretchen has
but it's like bread I like love empty
street like everything like yes your
shadows soft and like thick yeah
so I have that one and then I really
liked it so I got it in like it was like
dark grayish black one also and I have
this so cool really like airy and like
flowy and then I like how I was like I
cut out I have this cool racerback
yeah this will there call back yeah so
I've bad pain I got afraid and then I
just got this one oh it's such a pretty
color yeah I really like this one I yeah
okay I have the power Y on I would
literally buy like 20 of these just cos
like they're so great all the ones that
the built-in sports bras are great
then I have this show Q I forgot I had
this actually and I like the color and
then I have this other boy chick and
look at the back is like cool I really
like this style it's like high neck that
they don't have it anymore I don't think
but gotcha got me this one it's really
pretty I'm gonna have this one in the
same style we're gonna do chores like
shirts and mostly shirts for short
sleeve shirts I only have four of these
at my money more because I really really
like them I have this purple one which
is like this dark but like bright purple
color I love it so much it's like just
beautiful my newest one
this one's just great and it has this
cool like crisscross II design pattern
all over it and then either spread one
which is my first short sleeve shirt
from there it's pretty bright red color
and I also have it in this like mint
green blue color look I only have four
like I want I really like this one and
I'm just really like this color now
we'll begin to long-sleeve shirts these
long-sleeve shirts are all the same like
style same material or just nice when
you work out yeah they're breathable the
first one I have is just this like
medium blue color and it's the exact
same that Lucy has because I copied her
I just thought it was such a pretty
color and then I just have this bluish
purple long-sleeve that I also love too
and then I also have it in the
kind of mint green color Aisle seven is
really really pretty purple color it's
kind of like heathered purple looking
like it's a little right it's like you
along with our long sleeves we're just
going to show you our jacket
Lucy's - I have one I have this light
gray in dark gray zip-up hoodie it's so
adorable I love it I literally wear all
the time I also have this black is it
best from a lemon it's really like
form-fitting like it's actually pretty
tight I really like it for when I run
outside it's really good to put on top
of those long-sleeve shirts but I have
no on that Gretchen got the same one as
me the color is so pretty I like had to
buy and I got this one her Christmas I
want it so bad like dark gray I have
like other gray ones with this like
really dark grey and then I have this
really cool sweatshirt it's like that
did it's like actual mesh like right
there it has a hood and it has like the
hole in the hood like always only if
your hoods up that's so cute is it for
yeah and this I got any one of the
vlogmas days and it's like really really
thick then we're going to show you sure
these first shorts I'm going to show you
are seriously my favorite shorts Everage
workout in there called the what the
sport shorts and I love them they're so
awesome because they're like tight like
spandex and they're like the perfect
length they're not too long or not too
short and I've noticed that when I run
they don't ride up like a lot of my
spandex would and these are just like I
guess tight enough and just built in the
right way that they don't right up so
they're like literally awesome and I
also have pockets bonus like even better
I always use them and put like car keys
in there ID phone like whatever so
clearly I had to also get them in
another color and these ones are cool I
think they're like reflective you okay
wedding outside I wear these like all
the time
and then these I feel like we're
discontinued oh they're called the
groove shorts aren't they
there won't be I think they're called
the group chores so excessive Lululemon
I know like all the names it's really
sad basically I should work that on an
older and then I also have them in all
black with this cool design on the top
how cool is that it's like black and
white different stripes then I just have
these black like looser shorts and
they're good for running they're a
little short I just have these are the
groove shorts she said yeah have these
these are really cool they're like mesh
yeah they're cool then we'll show you
and for pants I have a bunch of them
because I really love their Lucky's
they're so awesome and like really good
quality and the first pair I have to
show you are just plain black wonder
editors these at puppies take me back
these were my first thing I ever got
from Lululemon I'm pretty sure just like
your basic leggings and mine are getting
pretty old and like pili so I got
another pair but I decided I would get
some like fun festive ones and these
ones have this really really pretty
design yeah so they are reversible you
can flip them inside out and they're
just like the plain black ones but you
can flip on this way and they have this
cool floral print these are probably my
favorite pair just because I wanted to
get another black pair like my other
ones cuz they are getting old but I was
like if I can get cool ones at the same
time that are reversible and they're
like not the exact same pair that's
awesome and then I almost forgot to
include these pairs of leggings because
I have two pairs of cropped leggings
these are just like navy blue ones and
they're kind of Rouge at the bottom I
like to wear them that much because I
don't really like working out on cropped
leggings but I have those ones and I
also have a dark green ones or set this
forest green color and then I got those
toasty tektites that Lucy has that I
love I just got the plain black ones and
I'm so happy I got them because I
seriously love them and they're
beautiful another type of leggings that
are my favorite from women are called
the speed tights they're black these are
so awesome too because they have pockets
on the side kinda like those shorts I
showed you and I literally wear these
all the time I like live in them and
they're like flattering they like are
tight in the right area say let's make
your legs look like they make your butt
look good I think too and they kind of
go a little bit higher so for speed
tights I got these pretty recently and I
love these they're herringbone just like
gray and black really thin herringbone
and again they have like the little
zipper on the back so you can put like
you little keys your your 50 in there
when you run and you have your well
pocket then I have two pairs of the
episode Street pants
and Lucy got me hooked on these because
she had them in green first and you love
them and so I was like I need that these
are so beautiful you guys know I love
royal blue I don't know why I'm just
like obsessed with it just like calls my
name whenever I see it and I remember
when these first came out on their
website I saw them and I was like
and I like ready order them write them
in there they're just beautiful up to
the street material like Lucy said is
like really thick and soft and nice it
pills kind of easily that's the one
thing I will say yeah that's one thing
you could fix the lid on in wine aren't
too bad but they're just like this yeah
you just have to like be careful love
wearing these hot yoga I also want to
note that I think Lululemon markets them
is like 7/8 pants like they are just go
all the way down I wanna let you guys
know too if you're shorter just be wary
about their pants because of your heavy
FMN which is like pretty tall the pants
are long enough on me they fit really
well and they might even punish young
families yeah yeah so they're like
really long pants so if you're like 5-1
you might have to be careful it maybe
get like the cropped ones or something
no 7000 yeah or the 7/8 please like or
like ankle pants I would say also have
them in this dark purple color then I
have these gray Wanderers when I went
with Justin I was like ok pick out
something that you think is cute that I
should buy and he was like you have to
get these and they're just like gray
wonder unders they're like the black one
but just great I got like forever ago
these are the black skinny will pants
and I'm pretty sure they don't even sell
them anymore but they go kind of like
high-waisted and I just tie and they
have pockets right there but you can
like folding over - yeah I like folding
them over I don't even think you're
supposed to but I like folding over or
else they go really high they're just
like straight legs pants like they're
not really skinny and tight like the
leggings and my crotch leggings
they're like really nice they feel
really new still and then these are my
wander on there's I've been through a
lot but they're still like my favorite
things ever and then I thought they were
supposed to be I always did but you can
hold the more I think like either one I
wear them rolled over and these are my
ab discreet pants on them so many times
I like what them they're just so soft
and like thick and these are my favorite
pants like ever ever full oh my friend
had them and I really loved them and I
was like I need those because they're
quilted I don't know if you can see
they're quilted like on the sides throw
it a little bit and then they have like
the pattern inside the pockets like the
thickest softer the insides fuzzy guys
like it's like amazing I need them do
like I really like gray and black these
are my only pair of speed tights I want
to get
there but a lot of speed tights are like
kind of more like spandex the only
really big more shiny kind of but
they're really cool and I love the
pockets like I literally just walk
around with my hands in the pocket so I
love running in the butt kinds right
stripey and my last pair of pants is
like the ones Gretchen has in black got
them in green I love green pants they're
good I usually wear them rolled over
they're so comfy and I like Heather

like accessory type things to show you
