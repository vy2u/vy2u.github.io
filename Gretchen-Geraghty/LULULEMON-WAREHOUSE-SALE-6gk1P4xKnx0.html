exciting video to share with you and I'm
actually showing you all the stuff that
I got at the Lululemon warehouse sale
and I'm going to show you some stuff
that I didn't get a balloon or no sale I
just went to the store after it got some
stuff so the lumen warehouse sale is
actually taking place this weekend in
Boston today is October 17th and I went
yesterday the 16th I think yesterday was
the first day it was open so I was like
oh like it'll be fine like stephane be
gone no it was like a ready picked
overlook there were so many people there
it was actually very aggressive like
women were like ripping stuff off of
racks like it was kind of scary so I
found some good stuff there but it was
pretty picked over like there wasn't a
lot of the really good like popular
stuff which makes sense because it was
like a sale so then I just walked over
to Newberry after and went to the actual
Lululemon store and got a bunch of stuff
there too
and we all know I'm so accessible lemon
so yeah this is just really exciting
that I could show you all the stuff that
I got and I'm also going to be showing
you the stuff that Lucy got from the
warehouse sale Oh in fun fact I'm little
Side Story so I'm actually a competing
ahead of Charles this weekend I'm racing
tomorrow at 3:53 to be exact and we
actually weighed in this morning so I've
been eating so much sugar today so I'm
like really really hyper
so you guys know that's why I have like
so much energy right now cuz I've been
eating candy and like cookies and bagels
and Nutella and peanut bar sandwiches
all day
Lusine I have a tradition that we always
get Nutella and peanut butter sandwich
after weigh-ins so yeah this is getting
really off topic
guys well she's watching me record this
say hi ha ha I told them I'm gonna have
you try on your stuff did you slip on my
step stool careful she's about to go cut
up her Apple huh
you're such a weirdo go away oh no no
okay sorry this beginning is so long I
already know and most of you were like
just showing you four kids up already
okay now I will starting off with the
stuff that I got from the warehouse sale
the first thing I got is actually a
bathing suit I didn't even know a woman
had bathing suits until I got to our
hotel and they had some so I just got
this plain black triangle top the back
is really cool it's just kind of strappy
like that looking and it goes into a
little like triangle shape and like I
said in my last haul video I'm going to
a river with Justin so I can wear it
this bathing suit there and then the
bottoms I got are Jesse's
black-and-white printed ones and I
really like this too because the sides
have those little like straps like that
honestly I just want to be able to say I
have a baby to flip 11 I'm so basic sake
and also to at the warehouse sale they
gave me this cool lemon bag which I'm
really a fan of because it's like
different than their normal just red
ones you know so that's really cool and
the next thing I got is this hat and
it's a light gray and white striped hat
and it just has like a grey band right
there I think it's actually reversible
too tonight is just like right on this
side I really like this a lot and I had
to get it because you like a hat rule
here at BU like when we're o in the
winter they want to make sure that
you're staying warm enough and that you
don't get sick so we have to wear hats
on our head when we're oh and I've never
had to run a hat before but so I thought
I would get the cute ones that I'd want
to wear it then I got two pairs of
shorts I'm so happy I got these because
I was looking for more like black
spandex terrowin anyway and I just got a
plain black pair of these ones what do
they called it one goes like the groove
shorts or something yeah these are
called the crew shirts you're right and
they actually like just continue telling
these I think so I think that's why
these are out the sale and I'm so happy
because I like one of these exact ones
and I was kind of sad they just
continued them so I'm really happy I
found these there I got these ones too
and they just have this cool design at
the top they're like black and white
stripes and I guess they're just both
black and white stripes they're just
kind of different black and white
stripes so then mr. Liu Xia are actually
sharing and it's just a white peplum top
it's like a t-shirt but it kind of flows
out at the bottom like that and Lucy's
been on the hunt for a shirt like this
for so long so she was like so excited
that she found
nice this is just like a cream color and
the sleeves are a little bit long so
that's why we rolled them up they both
like it so we're gonna share it Frick
Cynthia twit and I really want to find
some like long-sleeve shirts at the sale
but I did so that I had to go to the
actual store and just buy some but first
I'm just gonna show you so that Lucy got
from the sale was he's lucky because she
went earlier in the day when it was like
less picked over so she got some stuff
that wasn't even there when I went like
a couple hours later she got this light
pink tank top just seriously it's so
cute like I just love it and yeah it's
just like tight-fitting and it's it
really so it'll be perfect for working
out in and rowing in of course she had
another tank top there seriously with
zero tank tops when I went just this
purple color it's so pretty I love the
cut of this one too and it's just like
outlined in black it's a higher necked
in the front and then the back like dips
down really low like that I think it's
so adorable
I'm little against Jenny's from her and
like borrow them oh my god - oh she did
here ha Heys please there's peanut
butter on it she's the best I already
finished magic bean for
and the one I bought from Trader Joe's
listen I consume so much pretty motor
it's unreal I would say half of my
calories on an everyday basis come from
peanut butter maybe more you say that's
an accurate assumption and unless you
just got the same black crew shorts as
me because like I said we really handy
to go in and workout in so yeah if you
never have enough of black spandex you
know if you row and then obviously got
these green pants for seriously so cute
I showed you guys actually have these in
black and I love them they're like kind
of a little bit more high-waisted Lucy's
watching the live I've had the Charles
right now you know you're dedicated to
rowing when you're watching a live feed
when you're not at the course
nothi anyways back to these green pants
they're kind of like their leggings so
they're like tight as they go down but
they don't like grab at your ankles they
just go straight down since they're so
high-waisted you can also like whirled
them over if you want and yeah these are
the best so I'm gonna borrow these two
and I'm Lucy and I got these matching
purple headbands they're so cute they're
just like they're normal like thin
headbands and they're on this kind of
like faded out purple color yeah I just
think these are so cute and now we can
match and me extra twins cuz we're ready
twins but now we'll be really twinning
alright I just have a couple more things
to show you that I got from the store
that I went to right after the sale
because I was a little less than
impressed with the sale but I still had
some cute stuff so I know this is crazy
but I actually got three long sleeves
because I really wanted long sleeves
however I have like a purpose for them
it gets so so cold here in Boston and we
row into like the end of November so we
like really need like a lot of layers
and gear to wear when it's so cold so I
definitely will get use out of like all
of them and they're really cute too so
I'll just like wear them around but the
first one I got is just this blue color
one and you guys know I'm obsessed with
blue lately so I seriously love it and
it's kind of like striped - I just like
love the color this one it's like so
pretty and yeah I don't know what else
to say about them they're just like thin
so you can like work out and then but
they also like keep you warm and they're
really really tight fitting so they
don't get in the way when you're around
and I also have these little like thumb
holes too if you want that and then next
long-sleeve I got is actually a blue
color but this one's more like a light
medium blue and yeah I'm so yeah yeah
he's careless yeah hi I'm her RA bitch
is going to be the longest haul video
ever I've literally been filming for so
long and Lucy was like kept talking
during it like feeding me that's so
funny that my roommate in Stephanie came
in during this stuff that was Stephanie
she's my RA she's like the best RA ever
she said sweet and I got this like blue
one which I actually copied Lucy because
I loved her so much she has the exact
same one and Oh awesome - like sighs my
friends so this one's a four but then
these two I got twos like I don't know
what I really am between like a foreign
into it lululemon so I can get like
either that's weird that I got one is a
foreign two or twos I didn't even notice
but whatever is copied let's see cuz she
had it and I like loved it so much so
these are just like really awesome shirt
I just like to ruin them so they're
really handy and that's a long-sleeve
shirt I got is just this like dark
purple kind of heathered purple it would
say one because there's kind of some
like white and grey in there yeah I just
like this one too I think it's so pretty
I love purple hey these are kind of
almost the same color my purple headband
- my purple shirt well I knew there was
one last thing I forgot to show you so
then at Lululemon store - not the
warehouse I like the actual store I
found this tank top it looks like a
plain black tank top right like it just
kind of has a built-in sports bra and
it's like a little bit sheerer
but then the back is so cool there's
just all these different little cutouts
and all these spots so it looks like so
cool on like I seriously love it and
this is also in a - it's like a little
bit tight on me like I usually try to
get a four in their tank tops but you
