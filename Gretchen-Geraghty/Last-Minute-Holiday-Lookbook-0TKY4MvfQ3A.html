been like Christmas at all
hey everyone so I know this is a super
last-minute sense this is going up
Christmas Eve but I was thinking you
could assist for your look tomorrow
during Christmas Day or maybe even for
New Year's Eve but I've just divided
this video into three different lists
that I thought would be appropriate for
the holiday time and this first one I
just have my hair curl I have this red
sweater which I don't even know where I
got it from from like some online
boutiques
I have this watch from Daniel Wellington
it just has the silver metal accents
with a brown wristband and my nails are
just as taupe color I have some brown
natural looking eye shadow I was playing
with this fun Santa hat that I found in
these little Christmas purse present
decorations I have this silver infinity
necklace that Justin got me for our two
year anniversary I have this black in
lace skirt from Urban Outfitters which i
think is so cute
and I'm again just showing you my
dandelion so much I will have all the
Demi loans and watches that I have
featured in this video linked down below
so you can check them out now in the
second look it's a lot more edgy my
first one I went for a more kind of
fancy if Christmas dinner look and this
is a little bit more edgy my gray bag is
from a Teddy Blake I have that link down
below as well it's super nice quality
and I've been using it a lot recently I
my name is blackhat Daniel on to watch
it's just all black and add some gold
details I have these black boyfriend
jeans from Abercrombie &amp;amp; Fitch my jacket
is also from ever coming vintage dresses
green military jacket and I'm about to
take it off so I can show you more in
detail when I'm wearing the underneath
I'm wearing this gray short sleeve shirt
from Urban Outfitters it's just really
long and slouchy and I love the Henley
style top with all the buttons at the
top right there and I have a silver
layered necklace also from Urban
Outfitters there is a black watch they
mentions like I said I was
down below I'm obsessed with the daniela
- nachos i they're so so cute and i even
have a little discount code for you that
will also be linked down below in here
my third and final outfit i just had
these booties from at Nordstrom Rack I
think they're so cute cute little wedges
with some for accents great for that
colder weather my hair is just pulled
back into a ponytail and I have a tan
soft sweater from forever 21 my dark
wash jeans are from American Eagle and
I'm wearing a brown Daniel on too much
but this one has some gold accents my
necklace is from a website called
happiness boutique I also have that link
down below so you can check it out I
think it's so cute
just the crystal details and I don't for
a little bit of a darker lip I have some
red lips going on and yeah I think this
is casual and cute but still fancy
