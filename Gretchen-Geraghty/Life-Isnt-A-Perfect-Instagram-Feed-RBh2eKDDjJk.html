Tuesday November 7th now and if you
couldn't tell I was traveling back from
LA on Sunday morning well weather Sunday
morning all the way to Sunday night
because it was just like an all-day
sorta thing I just wanted to talk to you
guys really quick obviously I didn't
well guess right that's because I am
very built right now this thing has sort
of started to happen where like I get
anxious for traveling and flying so much
which I've never had before but like I
think just traveling so much especially
in the past like year I guess a lot
being for YouTube a lot being for
personal reasons a lot you know just to
like see my friend to experience the
world like I feel so grateful and so
lucky and blessed that I've been able to
travel as much as I do but I also just
want to tell you guys like I feel like
everyone looks on social media online is
like these people are still lucky they
have these like amazing lives they can
travel so much I'm so jealous but while
they're so lucky what else well you guys
know like I don't know I think we should
like the best parts of ourselves on
social media I mean everyone knows that
like if you have a perfect Instagram
feed your life is no he's a perfect
Instagram feed even I'm saying like keep
picking choose and obviously I choose to
highlight like the best parts of my day
and my life and whatever because that's
like me being happy and what's most
interesting and you guys know me like I
am like the most positive like puppy
like I'm just always like like I'm just
so positive and I don't even know why
really I just have always been like that
and I kind of see everything like as an
opportunity and like I don't know like
even when bad things happen I'm like wow
though such a great learning experience
I know not to do that again they're like
I know that I deserve better I think
I've talked about that before I don't
know like I'm just doing like a very
positive person but like something about
traveling I don't know I just want to
bring somebody guys like
I am so sickly no it's swollen like and
yeah I always to be so excited for
traveling whenever and out like whenever
I travel I get so anxious and nervous
because I know I'm gonna get sick
whenever I travel I get sick no matter
what it like when TV on the weekend
before felt really ill coming back and
like something just takes so much out of
you and Mike I know I need to sleep a
certain amount of hours or I will get
sick and sometimes it's just not
possible when your flight gets in super
late to LA on Friday night and they say
be at the convention center super early
for style coffee already means I just
didn't walk yesterday I like whenever I
would stand up I would feel like really
faint and I don't have to like sit back
down I made myself go to class I was
dying in Tosh was across classroom
eating he's like I know but whatever so
this past night I probably slept like 10
hours the night before I was like 13 and
a half I kid you not I was like I didn't
know it seems like it's possible it's
gonna song Oh yesterday chapter I got
this really cute shirt guys it's from
like our date party I got this really
massive size it was like baking comfy in
sorry this is like so all over the place
I don't even know what I'm trying to get
at
basically just know that like I guess
youtubers are like real people too and
like I do see your negative comments and
everything like traveling does get the
best of me and there is stuff that like
it's not my Instagram and there's like
hard things about life to even a near
youtuber and all you see is like the
most perfect beautiful Instagram
pictures and like happy bright fun
videos I don't know but one thing I
think I mentioned this is like a recent
blog I think I've been getting a lot of
constructive criticism and that I really
do like and I think in the past it used
to be hard for me to take criticism I
definitely have a bunch of friends that
have a really hard time a Christian so
even if it is constructed like Lucy
being one of those people I love you leo
but if something says mentor like oh
like maybe I don't know just by our
video maybe make the intro a longer
shorter something as simple as that
should be well I tried you know I mean
like gets like upset about it it's like
I used to be like that but no I really
do take your constructive Chris
constructive criticism and I like it and
like me filming this right now is not
taking your constructive criticism going
to account because a lot of people say
that my vlogs I've been doing a lot of
like sitting in
and you guys instead of actually doing
and that's because pretty much his whole
semester for me is like doing my core
project and I've talked about that for I
want to make whole video about it so you
guys know like what my life has been
like in high I'm dying but I really
don't do that much so that's why I can't
vlog because I'm stuck in the business
school all day long
literally today we're not meeting in the
morning which like god bless but
normally we meet from 10:00 to 12:00 we
have class 12 to 4 and then we look
forward like 7 so I'm in the business
school at 10:00 to 7:00
come back eat dinner go to bed come back
and did it to more homework go to bed so
that's why but long story short this is
gonna be that end of todays vlog which
is today and traveling back from LA and
I just wanted to play guys down we're
really even - and just like bear with me
and I'm gonna try to vlog as much as I
can because I really like having
memories to look back at I love having
you guys like keeping up with my life
and like December flog miss will be so
much better because I won't feel like
stressful AF but yeah the next two weeks
are us finalizing our business plan it's
120 pages long so I might miss a day or
two here and there but I just wanna tell
you guys don't with click on yeah and
hopefully get over this sickness ooh and
I feel like I'm sick every other day
because I just wear myself into the
ground that's that
you guys for watching and I'll see ya
