I actually stink and Lucy and I went to
the marathon earlier with our friend
Megan and it was so so fun and I'm the
dumbest person ever and I actually
forgot to bring my camera so stupid
Gretchen but I did take some little like
snapchat videos if you guys follow me on
snapchat it's always like link down
below to if you don't my snapchat name
is just at Gretchen with five ends
shameless self promo we weren't exactly
at the finish line but we were close so
anyways that was awesome and like I said
I just forgot to bring my ball camera
earlier though I just thought I would
start welding now because it's still
like a really fun day Marathon Monday is
always just really fun in Boston I came
last year even though I didn't go to
school here I just skipped school for
the day it's really really warm out it's
like the warmest it's been in a while it
was literally seventy-two degrees out so
I'm wearing like a dress in sandals and
a sweater and like it's so nice out so
that just makes me happy and Lucy and me
and Anna Lucy's roommate are going to go
get food from whole heart provision soon
are you so excited
we love whole heart provisions it's like
this all vegan all-natural like organic
place that's like not too too far from
campus so that's really cool perk of
going to BU is having no class on
Marathon Monday that's like the one
reason we love coming here now just
kidding but um it is nice not having
class today so that we can enjoy
Patriots day or I feel like everywhere
but Boston it's called Patriots Day but
like in Boston is called Marathon Monday
so yeah before we leave for a whole
heart provisions - I just wanted to show
you this one app that I've been using
that's so cool and it's called pick pal
it looks like that there we go and when
you open it up it first looks like that
and then you can take a picture so I'm
gonna take the picture real quick I'm
writing all caption on it I'm ready I'm
hungry and then you can send it to your
friends and Lucy is literally my only
friend so I'm hurt so it's basically
like a collage and then I just wait for
Lucy to respond
so basically PayPal is an app where it's
like you just send selfies and it makes
it into like this little collage when
you make the collage like with friends
you can do it with like at least four
people so like let's see at me and my
parent
can do it we can have like a forearm a
little collage and also you can like
update your photo like during the day
when you do different things so they can
see like what you're up to and I user
name is gr Garrity as you can see and
you should definitely add me like I just
mentioned my username that way we can
take pic pals together anything will be
so fun and I will have it linked down
below so you can check it out if you're
interested I'm so hungry
everyone our mom and dad they visited us
yesterday and I was really happy they
came oh wait I walked that day you'll
see that before they slog probably I
know maybe after this vlog I don't know
we'll see anyways my mom brought us
these and they're so yummy they're
organic toasted coconut chips and I
think she drove them out Fresh Market if
you guys have that or the Trader Joe's
or I don't know something like that but
they're really yummy
oh no time Nate age like your sugary and
sweet but they're not in fat for you cuz
they're doing that chips and you should
try them if you haven't had track if you
haven't tried them beforehand hand try
them good almost needed there's foam Oh
which we're not gonna go to because
we're gonna be healthy and here do you
have some in our freezer there's whole
heart provisions I wonder if anyone
that's watching this video has like gone
there before I actually haven't been
inside yet I've only ever been outside
and when you've gone it for me yeah you
look really fresh with your sunglasses
Lou
but we have to go to Roxy's one time -
grilled cheese and burgers I'm other
really good I'm not really a grilled
cheese person you know I think I have a
really good grilled cheese it's about
what close why does it look dark well
our provision looks kind of dark
wait there's wait there's really no one
there oh my no wait I just realized I
was like wait it looks kind of dark oh
my god this isn't me so sad I'm about to
cry it's totally closed it's totally
closed probably cuz its Marathon Monday
I didn't even think of that
no I was like they'll totally be open
cuz I'll get so much business okay I
guess plan B which we don't really have
a plan B now what when a whole heart
provision is closed so we just walked
like over a mile to get here all right
we're gonna go find a plan B okay so
both our provisions
hopefully we can go there another time
oh yeah we've been wanting to try and
Lulu's it's like diner in Allston so
we're just gonna walk there
cross your fingers head open and then
it's not really crowded I really hope
it's not crowded though because it's
like Marathon Monday but yeah hopefully
that goes well hopefully they have yummy
brunch
I wouldn't mind having brunch right now
I kind of wanted to eat like a healthy
like tofu like kale rice bowl but I
asked me to just do that on our time
that can give us another excuse to vlog
another time what do we have
oh yeah we had really healthy lunch I
think I wish I walked earlier because I
might would have um you guys would have
seen sweet green nothing you haven't
already seen a million times before
because we go there every day but we
have to see green wonders really I mean
I show them look at what they have for
an appetizer then it is just called day
bunnies sing yellow
it was the only six so I just like
little black figures because the lights
coming next night so probably gonna be
me yeah really good lighting for me
holy moly I got a burger and so long but
this is like a black bean burger so it's
like different oh my gosh and we decided
we're gonna share everything Lucy you
got me what did Lucy get what is it
thank you
they just got us Brussels sprouts too
because that's my favorite thing what's
on top is that like cheese you think
