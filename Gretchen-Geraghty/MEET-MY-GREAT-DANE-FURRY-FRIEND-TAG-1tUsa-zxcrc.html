cooperating and sitting down yeah today
me and Ozzy are filming the furry friend
tag yay if you guys didn't know I have a
black Great Dane named Ozzy and I love
him he's being hard to cooperate with so
I got some treats she might eat ha no no
no whoa oh oh he loves this tree okay
sit down
whoa okay no more for now just wait the
first question is what is your animals
name and his name is Ozzie okay question
come back alright question 2 is what
kind of animal is he and what is the
breed he is a dog and he's a Great Dane
the third question is how long have you
had your pet friend and I have an Aussie
since I was in fifth grade and I'm going
to be a sophomore in college so that is
about eight nine years right Ozzy come
here love me yeah question four is how
did you receive your pet and we received
Ozzy when our other Great Dane sadly
passed away he passed vanished third
birthday when we you're on vacation in
Mexico
Great Danes are just really big in their
lifespan isn't that long so they're
pretty susceptible to blow which is how
our first Great Dane blacks passed away
so then my mom I remember she came home
with him she told us she was just going
to look at Great Danes and she came home
with this baby little black crazy and
I'll answer the picture right here
they're so little when you first get
them but they just have these ginormous
paws in really floppy skin because they
get really big like this guy's he weighs
way more than me he's like how much are
you 150 like 160 I don't even know he's
so big how old is the pet Ozzy must be
eight or nine years old and because we
got him when he was only a couple months
old back when I was in fifth grade so
he's probably like eight I would say
number six says what are some quirky
aspects of your pet and I would say a
quirky aspect is that he thinks he's
little I'm not kidding like Great Danes
are these like massive dogs if you can
tell how big he is balance
another picture of him standing up with
me but what's quirky is Great Danes or
actually I don't know about all of them
but he just thinks he's little he thinks
he's a lap dog I'm not kidding when you
sit down crisscross applesauce he'll
just sit on your lap look he thinks he's
a little dog but he crushes you because
he's so big he wants the treats he can
see them number seven says what is your
connection with your dog imply to you
well this is deep is net him such a
conceited boy not little big I just like
that he's there to make everyone in my
family including me feel better and when
you pet a dog
it's literally like therapeutic I think
it's like actually proven that like
petting a dog makes you feel better
because you're just like hi doggy number
eight says what are your favourite
pastimes with your dog hmm Ozzy and me
like to just cuddle and he likes to be
pet he likes to sleep a lot especially
now that he's getting older like eight
years old he sleeps a lot of the day so
usually he's just really good at
relaxing and yeah are you looking at
bunny
number nine says what is your pet's
nicknames and pretty much it's just
Aziz Oz oswaldo puppy even though he's
not a puppy sometimes we call him puppy
yep good boy I think that is all the
questions we have and I thought it would
be nice and easy and we would just sit
down over there in film but he's been
all over the place I keep upping to
Moses just you can see him alright so
that is it for the furry friend tag
thank you guys so much watching this
video I'll see you my next one bye okay
now he's just chillin I just look Great
Danes love to do they love to just lean
on you and like nudge you with her head
and you pet them okay this is very hard
to film with the dog I'm starting to
realise ha ha ha Zee I should have
filmed this when he was like sleeping</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
