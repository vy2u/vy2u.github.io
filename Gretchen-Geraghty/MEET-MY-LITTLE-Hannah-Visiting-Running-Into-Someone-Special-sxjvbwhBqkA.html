I like that but I also want
we really should go to Earl's Earl is so
good I'm ready okay so now me and Hannah
are gonna go meet up with my little
Julia and we're gonna go to Earl's and
I'm really nervous because it's a Friday
night and we don't have a reservation
and it's always packed but hopefully we
can like get a seat at the bar on the
patio or something I don't know crossing
my fingers so that might be a little
rough but yeah it's gonna be really oh
my gosh it's like back to our room where
we first met where you were born I'll
show you right where she was born that
was right up there on the crowd yes
exactly
oh yeah it's literally right next to
Earl's after God so where our URLs
almost and we're hoping we don't play 80
years and yeah I am like sick I feel so
congested I can't
are you better like pretty much opaque
you and like not sleep again going out
and he makes it worse but you know
that's why I got said right there is
where she was I keep my music couldn't
see him but no no she was born
isn't it so cute Hannah yay look who I
ran into at dinner so happy but at least
I can show you a really cool view No
look at that
I can take a picture of you looking at
the sicko someone you guys see it
that's like campus but from 52 floors up
this is insane because with Lucy me came
before it was cloudy so we couldn't even
see the view but this is like beautiful
I'm actually happy I got up here okay
I'm really mad at myself
I just forgot my love camera because
we're leaving pearls right now
I was in a haze I had a rough beginning
of the day it wasn't my day so there no
job I just like wasn't blogging but we
got our favorite and that's a tight roll
now I know that another dragon because
the world looking today dragon and a
good one it's dynamite everyone get the
dynamite roll and then we're leaving
I love how pretty this place is but I'm
gonna tell y'all what happened in a bit
it was the crazy I feel like you haven't
even been in my vlog that much okay so
we thought we were leaving but it's like
we're not leaving because I brought
Express stuff that I've had chill any my
trip was on an exchange because I got
mediums and they are today nig so I have
to do these balls
oh my god I feel like I just stabbed so
it another thing because I cried too
damn but uh yesterday I'm still walk
through the protection center to express
I can't breathe I can't breathe I'm just
I'm talking because I can't breathe okay
oh hey did you see my throat so um it's
almost 1:00 a.m. now and basically we
got back from Earls and then I went to
Express so I could get looking I got
this jacket
um I exchanged the brown when I got
because I was like you know what I'm
just never gonna buy Brad Brown and um I
got a meeting my name's too big on me so
I got the black one which isn't perfect
because I lost my favorite black honey
bum jacket gone and I'm just hope but do
you notice anything different about me
I mean I have you know jewelry on and
earrings or anything and I have like
hair slicked back in a bun but I just
use loving tan um like self-tanning for
the first time and I never used
self-tanner ever fun fact like ever
because I'm always scared that would be
like a blue button but Maggie likes war
by loving tan so I just got having
tonight put it on and I was like so
scared like I let me put it on so
carefully and slowly and like I don't
know why he scares me so much but after
seeing Maggie do it so much in like how
she looked like I was just obsessed so I
put it on and already I just like how
like even I look like this part of your
arm is never tan if it's tan you don't
hang my neck never gets tan and ready I
just feel like I'm all like one color
and like I kind of love it
so I'm like I just a nap chatter I'm
like literally value and are you putting
this on every day and like I figure
because I teeth look whiter cuz my
skin's tanner so this is just like a
whole new world you guys use self-tanner
before he's loving can your favorite I
do have other favorite ones can you
comment down below because I'm like
super interested you know and yeah I
don't know this is just like a
realization for me so I'm already like
obsessed and Hannah's like Jessie wait
because you're gonna sleep in your
makeup even darker so I'm just
hopefully fades okay I'm a little
worried because I've caught in spray
tans like maybe three or four times
before and you know after they paid for
a while you just look like chunky and
like a bunch of different colors because
it's just fading off and like patches
and I'd always be like
but um yeah basically we just had like a
tell night I'm like so unproductive not
efficient like every day I'm like oh I'm
gonna like we're gonna do my closet and
like that doesn't happen I'm always a
mess but we just kind of like watch some
YouTube videos watch some Netflix
chillax
and how it's like almost one like time
in Gretchen Roca flies by and like it's
just always ends up being like 3:00 a.m.
and I'm like oh I got to go to bed so
anyway when you go to bed and it's gonna
leave it like new tomorrow and I'm sad
and what's really great about not having
class for me on Fridays is that like it
just feels like such a long weekend
every weekend because I'm like I think
you should be Sunday or Monday already
but tomorrow's only Saturday at like
3:00 Friday so great if you're in
college and you can make it so you don't
have class Fridays I would highly
suggest it not only because like
everyone doesn't want class Friday so
that they can have like a three-day
weekend every weekend like go out and
whatever but literally like Friday can
be your day of like okay I'm getting my
life together I'm like preparing for the
weekend I can get work done ahead of
time so it's done for Monday like you
don't I mean anyway so I would just like
suggest that because I just feel like it
lets you be I don't know we're prepared
for like your life then like in college
I mean in high school when you're at go
go go go Monday through Friday so anyway
I know if the life talks I'm just like
in a happy mood because I'm a little
lean okay love you thanks for watching
I'm not anything off the vlog it's only
Friday I'm gonna vlog tomorrow and
Sunday and it's gonna be a big huge
making blog yay
so see you bright and early probably</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
