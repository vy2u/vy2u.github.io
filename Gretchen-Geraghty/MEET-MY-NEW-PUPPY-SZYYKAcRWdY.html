for a while like if you guys saw her
bucket list
yeah we said like oh look we think we're
gonna get a new puppy cuz like Lucy's
one I'm one for a while so I always kind
of thought in the back of my head like
hey maybe we'll get one this summer but
like not the very very beginning in the
summer came so quickly and today Lucy is
just like Gretchen and he just came
wandering into my room and I was like
well to see my reaction I don't have the

day a reaction yeah sorry Phil the
Lighting's weird right now because it's
very dark out it's like almost 10 p.m.
but we just finally thought we would
film this video for you guys cuz we've
been playing with something puppy all
day I'm so so surprised also like I'm
trying to think of questions you guys
might have we do in fact have a Great
Dane right now his name is Ozzie he is
what eight years old wow I cannot
believe all these eight and half years
old so we do have another dog we thought
why not come down when you look so cute
right now excited Wow and we didn't know
what to name him at first and then I was
like you know what he looks like a teddy
bear so we need him teddy
he's a goldendoodle if we didn't say
that already wanna list down below where
we got him in case any of you were from
the new york where i'm york state if you
guys want a goldendoodle we got from
orchard pub well like link that down
below as well as our hair likes first
impression in reaction video we got him
like I said he'll be on our vlog Channel
he likes biting my hair so also if you
guys don't know Lucina I go to bond
University this is like the first video
you're watching I'm hours
obviously we're gonna be able to be with
him during this cleared up gonna be with
you for the next three and a half months
Bobby train him try to I think we might
go to like obedience classes really yeah
and a half weeks right now which is
pretty much like the youngest you can
get them looking he's a really like big
I feel like Oh in the name that making
my eyes was me I'm which is cute but I
don't know and when I first got him like
I only got him into the arms of like
lady who was like I think drove him here
and he was hired or like probably just
like shocked like I don't know but he
was like so just like laying there like
not doing anything he's such a cutie he
wakes Lucy so happy I'm happy that
you're happy because I can tell how
happy he makes it was like I don't know
he was like like bouncing on my Lucy has
been waiting for this dog for months
you don't want in a goldendoodle for so
long oh also this is a really good thing
to mention for you guys so Lucy is
actually allergic to dogs
she's very sensitive to them when even
with our dog Ozzie she'll get like hives
sometimes she has to take medicine and
Goldendoodles are hypoallergenic a lot
of dogs that are singing really
everybody hot a lot of dogs are mixed
with poodles or actually heckle
allergenic because poodles are
hypoallergenic where you going so he's
like really good for lucy because then
she's not allergic to him
and also also also was I going to say
also he doesn't shed since he's
hypoallergenic
it's so great so he's fluffy and cute
and you can pinch in there's like a
little boy you're hot aren't you gonna
be it for this video tiny need to go to
bed so cute babies Teddy I don't know
