after 7:15 right now and I'm so excited
it's also this morning so obviously I'm
in a good mood but I'm excited because I
literally bug my bike so last minute
like last night I was just like looking
for SoulCycle this morning cuz I haven't
gone yet this week it's ready Thursday
and I thought that Maddie was teaching
in at Chestnut Hill and I was gonna go
to her class on Tuesday but then she
hadn't it being like injured so she
couldn't teach but then I saw she was
teaching whatever it's a dirty chai
sorry it's early but I feel like
well-rested I'm like excited and I think
someone cancelled their bike in the
front row because literally the entire
class was booked except for bike 4 and
the front row was open and I was like
heck yeah I'm taking it
and it's kind of like a half an hour
away like it's like a hike and even
though class at 8:30 I think I'm living
at like 7:45 because I just like hate
being late for SoulCycle and obviously
it's like rush hour and just yeah just L
is like far from Vito so that's plan I'm
excited I know it seems crazy I was like
thinking on it oh my gosh it it would
take you half an hour to get there and
back you're gonna be in the car longer
than you're gonna even be there since
it's like a 45-minute class but I'm
still so excited and then what else we
have planned for the day I just wanna
give you a little overview oh this
afternoon I'm taking pictures at L F
which is gonna be so fun they just like
to get me and we're like want to take
pictures and I was like yeah I love
taking pictures and I think we saw you
just got a little so like want to take
pictures with her and I was like oh my
gosh yeah I like joy it's so stylish and
cool so that would be so fun and then oh
we and then I can walk Juliet because
she hasn't even been in the vlog because
I didn't even vlog during big little
week and then I think I might get dinner
hopefully she'll let us go to Chipotle
because I want to pull a I know she
likes Tripoli Thai and Lucy's boyfriend
Dara is coming this afternoon I'm so
freaking excited I haven't even met this
kid ninh been dating for six months look
I feel like I know him because he'd been
on FaceTime and stuff I'm freaking out
I'm so excited to meet him and yeah he
should be here I think around I think he
lands at like maybe 334 but I don't
think he'll actually Olli they're
totally five
just to go through like customs and
everything like he's coming from
Amsterdam yesterday but yeah let's go
so just cut back and I did it really
film it was just me my crazy what just
fell okay whatever but oh yeah it really
film there it was very crowded because
there was a cause getting out like right
before and I'm just gonna be honest you
guys know like if I go by myself I feel
so scared to throw them in there and I
also don't really want to film like like
when there's a bajillion people there
because I'm gonna get them like in my
video and they're all like sweaty
shirtless and they're like you know
let's some people we're just like a
Sports Bra like lighting was like that's
what I wear
so like probably a lot of people don't
want to be in my vlog and I don't have
their consent like whatever but a lot of
times I'll just film like my friends and
I'm there because it's like fun and I'm
like how are you Louisa Addie when we're
looking tripping and sweat after it was
really good and you guys know I go to
Maddie all the time she's literally the
best and I love her so much and just
going through a back injury right now
and I just couldn't say that I know what
it feels like and I just want to say for
all of you out there like those injuries
if you're really used to working out or
if you're like an athlete and stuff I
know it's literally the hardest thing
ever because freshman year and I was
still in the lightweight rowing team
here I broke a rib and it was awful it
was like excruciating pain like every
day and I would go to my like athletic
training like PT and just whatever and
it was just so hard and like she was
saying like and I saw on her Instagram
too like when you're so used to like
working out everyday and that's like
what you enjoy and especially for her
it's like her job like it's all like
performance-driven and just like being
an athlete so when your body starts to
like give up and you can't do it for a
while and you have to like try to
recover and stay positive
obviously it's so hard and I almost feel
like it's harder mentally than like
physically well I'm sorry short I just
want to say like I know injuries and
just like literally whatever is going on
in your life right now that's like hard
like I just think the power of positive
thinking is like so strong and I know a
lot of times it's like way more than
that and positive thinking maybe isn't
gonna work or just isn't enough you know
but all I can say is like having a
positive mindset I think there is
something to say for that and I just
want you to know that you got it boo
you're gonna be okay you're gonna come
out on the other side even stronger and
feeling all motivational now because I
just slowly go but I don't know that's
all I have to say because I know I just
like feel for her so much because I know
people especially Lucy like people that
have gone through stuff like that me
included and it's really tough because
it's just like a big change suddenly and
something that you're used to doing all
the time it doesn't even need to be
working out it could be like anything
that you just like can't do anymore
you're stopping doing like whatever um
speaking of that I don't know if Lucy's
talked about it on her Channel
but I guess I'll just mention it quickly
you guys know Lucy got medically
disqualified from lightweight rowing I
just left the team because I mean I was
starting to injured with my back and I
didn't want to get any worse and there
was like a million reasons you guys saw
that video but Lucy got medically
disqualified after trying to get better
for like a year and a half because after
her policies and I were freshman year
her back just was like in shambles and
literally for like a year and a half she
did everything she could try to get back
into it she would get like cortisone
shots in her back like every PT 80 like
whatever thing you can think of like she
tried it and they were like no like shut
it down like she kept getting MRIs and
was getting worse and they're like do
you want to go like older kids when
you're older I don't even know if she's
talked about it or five talks about it
but that just got me thinking I feel
like I should tell you guys because it's
gonna be like obvious when it happened
okay so right now it's April 5th Oh
daddy just replied to me um but Lucy is
actually getting back surgery in the
middle of May I want to say she said
it's scheduled for like May 14th or 15th
like right in the middle of May and it's
like really serious and tend to have
back surgery and she so like this is so
random that I'm talking about this right
now but I'm just thinking about it so I
feel like I should tell you and I just
want you all to like literally put her
in your prayers and just think about her
because this is something that's so big
for her and just like our family
obviously for her like go through this
and basically she went to this fact
doctor in Connecticut to see if she
could get like one of two procedures
done we were hoping it would be the less
invasive one where basically I might be
totally wrong but this is my
understanding of it that they can take
like a piece out of your disc she has
two really horribly herniated discs that
are just kind of like impairing her
everyday life she wakes up in pain ever
day I don't know if you guys have like
an injury like that but I just can't
imagine what it's like to be in pain in
your everyday life everyday she can't
work out she will try to here and there
but it just caused her so much pain so
her like quality of life I mean as far
as like pain wise is just so awful that
like obviously she had to consider
surgery and so yeah we were hoping she
could get the less invasive one where
they like either take a part of your
disc out or I think they like drain
fluid oh my god I don't even know what
I'm talking about but basically it's
just like less invasive and they like I
think they going through your back and
they like move some like nerves out of
the way I feel like that's how she was
explaining it to me and then they
thought that wasn't enough and they
recommended only okay and this is also
it scares me
should that only five doctors in the
whole world will do this cuz it's like
super invasive and like risky and so the
one she's getting done this one is they
go through her stomach and they have to
like move all of her organs out of the
way because what they do is they take
out her two discs I know it l5 s1 and l4
l5 is that what it's called oh my gosh
I know it's alpha s1 l4 s 104 this way
now I'm missing it okay basically just
do this and then they're next to each
other and they're really horribly hurt
and so they have to take them out and
then they put in like new metal discs
but getting new discs put into your
spine is obviously a really big deal and
just like working on your spine is like
really just like intense surgery and
she'll have to stay in the hospital for
a while to heal and then she'll go home
and heal for like months like maybe 1 to
2 months I think at least obviously just
cuz back surgery is like really intense
well I've been talking about this for so
long now but I just wanted to let you
guys know that that was coming
Pulu senior pairs I think about it all
the time and she's kind of preparing for
that um because now it's only like I'm
at than halfway which is so crazy but
she's nervous but I think excited too
because she knows when she heals she'll
be feeling so much better than she feels
now so I think obviously going through
surgery and healing after isn't going to
be easy but like once she gets past the
healing phase like it's
so much better than is now so yeah so I
want to say oh my gosh wait I need a
shower and like eat and stuff but
basically what I just talked about all
of that and so that you would just like
know what's going on and so that when
I'm like cuz I'm living in Boston this
summer I don't know if I've even talked
to you guys about it but I wanted to
stay in boss in the summer since I
haven't spent a summer in Boston like
last year I was in New York the year
before what did I do the summer before
last did I go home yeah I think I went
home but yeah whatever
oh okay so yeah I want to do I just
wanted you to know like why I wasn't
gonna be involved in the beginning the
summer because I'm gonna like paint
Connecticut with her like obviously at
the hospital and then like going with
her while she's like recovering and
stuff so I can just be with her yeah and
um I just wanted to say because I was
talking to Maddie about today's class
and she was like maybe next time we can
put you up with on what's it called
I still know that's heaven stole that
the the podium that's what it's called
when you ride the podium I'm like why
get it I'm like why can't I think about
it okay ride the podium and I always
thought that would be so fun like I
would be down because I literally five
out and SoulCycle and just like I have
fun and like dance and stuff but I don't
know like what I'm worried about is I
really don't know if I could ride look
at my left foot cuz obviously they have
to do everything backwards so people can
follow them and I really don't know if I
could do my left foot cuz I I just think
I'm so Tom and on my right foot that
like what are you drink the class I just
always for my right foot like leaving
everything I don't know if I could do my
left
you know that worries me
anyway
wait guys hi okay I want to interject
right now because you're probably like
what the heck is going on I look like I
don't balloon but okay see like the
lighting down there like that makes it
look funny but like this is the real
lighting in like I actually put on with
more makeup than I planned right now I
just kind of got carried away with the
ocean I wasn't going out at nighttime

sudden it was like a soul cycle me being
