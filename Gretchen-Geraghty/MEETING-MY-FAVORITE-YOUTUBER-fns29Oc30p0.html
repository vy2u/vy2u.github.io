Taylor later because we were broke on
this weekend's we didn't see each other
and today I just been a fun day I don't
know okay this just might be me but
there is something about these shoes
because crazy weird things have been
happening that don't normally happen I
wish I had my camera with me like for
example I ran into Kings and if you guys
don't know Kings look another youtuber
here at BU and I've like live live in
snapchatting him and talking to him for
like a really long time now and FaceTime
him and stuff but we literally never ran
into each other in person and then I ran
into him I was like on the front of my
mom at the bus stop and he like runs
away gives me a hug and I was like hey
what's up so it's really cool like seen
him in person and I don't know yeah I'm
wearing these new shoes that I got I
think I should have been a haul from
ASOS and when I tore them I didn't
realize how tall they are like these are
like tall puppies for class you know I'm
saying we probably four inches but
they're like legitimately heels not just
booties but I was like they're really
cute and that's not gonna stop me I'm
wearing them even though I'm literally
6:162 today and everyone's like since
when were you that tall gotcha and I'm
like that's me oh yeah I just got so
much packages from the mailroom let's go
have mail time and see what I got so the
first of my guys I literally ordered
underwear on Victoria's Secret so
probably don't care about that and then
I got hair extensions which I'm so
excited for expect like an Instagram
there's something with them soon
I can't wait to try them on I got really
long blonde ones and like my hair is
already gone I'm like pretty long
recently but I've always wanted like hip
length hair like hip length hair like
there so it hasn't gotten buzzing wine
hasn't gotten quite that long yet so I'm
really excited to try those out and then
we got so much shoes from Zoo shoe oh I
picked these out these are so cute I'm
really excited to wear these I don't
know what it is about shoes but recently
I've just been like so into shoes like
these really tall heels I wore today
booty things these are like my
confidence shoes like I felt so
confident and she's like killer in them
I love them ah I will link them down
below these really cutie bootie heels
Jermaine sauce and I was wanting ones
that had like this look for awhile so
anyway oh and these jeans by the way I
got this weekend in Long Island from
Ruby and Jenna but they're from the
brand flying monkey and I love them I've
gotten so many compliments on them still
getting over being sick and I'm really
hot right now gotta check out my jacket
so I'm currently making a piece of
avocado toast because although I'm going
to the dining hall in like two hours I'm
starving they don't really eat lunch cuz
of Cour so I'm just really good so a lot
of times I'll put like tomatoes or
something on top but I can't find my
tomatoes I don't know is someone ate
them all or threw them away or whatever
but yeah this one just has avocado and
some sea salt and pepper and it looks
really good got a little crispy but
that's okay why do you smell good
you literally smell the good human
having is just as a gym it don't ever
leave me again
my cake was not here I know oh my god
all my life I don't like God thank ya
Mandy so sick too
no okay glad to see a lot of people
around the corner hi puppy no okay no
instead okay guys I know I know this
looks scary but my extensions game but
they were like too orange so I washed
them a purple shampoo and if you can
tell in some spots I left it on too long
and they're kind of purply silver but
now they're like the color of my hair
but they had to dry so there's so many
of them and they're hanging and they're
drying and it's human hair I told you it
looks really scary like in the daytime
it'll be not as scary like it's 11 p.m.
now so it seems really kind of I don't
you think it's a color bunny oh it's the
color of my hair now that's what I try
to do it's close enough
