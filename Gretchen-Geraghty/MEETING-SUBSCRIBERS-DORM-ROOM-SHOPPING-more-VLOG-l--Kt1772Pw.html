I are going to be going dorm shopping
and I know I already had a vlog of me
and Justin norm shopping but we have a
lot more that we have to do yeah I'm
just feeling kind of like overwhelmed
with how much I have to pack and like my
room is a mess and I have to clean that
up and like pack everything up and I
have to get like school supplies today
too and just like so much dorm stuff
that you wouldn't even think about that
you need but like you need because
you're going to be living there like
cleaning stuff and I don't even know
we're getting a pretty late start to the
day because I slept till like 10:30 and
I think it's almost like - because I was
like editing for a while and chilling
and we so we really gotta like get a
start to our day I haven't even eaten
yeah I gotta go like eat breakfast slash
lunch and it's late I don't know and I'm
wearing a pretty crazy outfit if you ask
me it's different than what I normally
wear so I'm wearing this shirt from
brandy melville that's Lucy's and I
borrowed it and I'm wearing my royal
blue bra that I just got from Urban
Outfitters with Tasha and I'm like
obsessed with the royal blue so I had to
get that and then I'm wearing these
jeans that I got from a lookbook store
and so this outfit is just like so crazy
for me because I normally don't wear
crazy stuff like this I don't know and
then I'm wearing parama flip-flops and
yeah we're gonna go now
I've been reading this book
very good I'm already more than halfway
in the part that you sent me that was so
that's like I feel like it was just like
that from a hundred miles an hour to a
sleep in a nanosec I wanted so badly to
lie down next to her on the couch Trevor
I was around her and sleep but not like
in those movies not have sex just sleep
together the most innocent sense of the
phrase but I liked the courage and she
had a boyfriend and I was coffee and she
was gorgeous and I was hopelessly boring
and she was endlessly fascinating
so I walked back to my room and
collapsed on the bottom bunk thinking
that a peeper will rain I was a drizzle
and she was a hurricane
when she was a freak a that gives you
the chills I just got to the after
section so and I just like read the
first like two pages of it so
I'm really excited to get school
supplies it's really fun I feel like I
was never into getting ready - no
supplies but yesterday watching a school
supply haul video and I know they're
like all over YouTube and I never really
washed out and I was always like what's
the big deal but like watching people
get like you know pretty crisp like
folders and notebooks unused like and
like paper like pretty parents I don't
know exciting now I feel the excitement
so I'm really excited the best place
ever just kidding
Hey oh my god we have so much
I literally can't even God is like OMG
we've been here for two hours
yeah let go through it all
two hours later I'm hot and tired and
broke pistachios are the best thing ever
and we do not think we'd be in there
that long and I did not think it would
be an expensive oh but we're on our way
out we made it everyone now I think
we're gonna go to look back and beyond
maybe target may get many woods and we
won't be getting as much stuff in this
places but some other stuff how was it
will
stressful guys look at our backseat
we're too lazy to put it in our trunk so
we just crammed it on our backseat
and it's craziness and I was starving so
I got these pistachios for myself oh
this music to see Lucy always has the
best music guys I'm tired it's just
easier for Lucy me to go during the day
when we're not working gonna be nice
like have our parents with this you know
but they're like obviously at work so
yeah it's already 5:30 holy crap we were
literally there for two two-and-a-half
hours we'd like find all our stuff I

a subscriber in Viviani jus so cute her
name was Chandler I love that name I
think it's a pretty same ever so
Chandler if you're watching this it was
so nice meeting you sorry I've just been
like really stressed out today like
getting everything so I feel like I was
waiting in line and I was like just like
not happening she's like hi do you make
youtube videos so I also I always do
this in vlogs where I like forget to
include people in the vlogs that I meet
cuz I just like don't think about it so
I wish I would have said like be my log

Instagram so hopefully I'll see that
maybe I'll insert it right here if I
find that picture
but it was nice meeting you and she
actually went to like a school near me
and like knew some of my friends from
rowing Rebecca she knew Rebecca if
Rebecca doesn't watch my videos but yeah
she knew Rebecca oh I got this huge
shore thing and I just grabbed with one
hand basically I'm buff so that was
really cool meeting a subscriber even
though I feel like I look like homeless
today look at all these stuff good lord
also on that's really funny when I met
Chandler she was like did you do like a
dorm home video because I was watching
dorm videos and like that's how I knew
what to get and like that's my shoe
shopping right now so I thought that was
really cute because she watched my dorm
home video so yeah we're just gonna go
to Staples really quick because there's
some more school supply ish type
thingies that I want
Lucy told me she wanted to wait in the
car cuz she didn't need anything so I
made myself so alone that's one thing
about me if you guys didn't know that I
hate being alone first I ended up
joining me huh I got so much more stuff
placated sneak peek um actually this is
gonna go up after my school supply haul
probably but I got a purple folder like
polka dots but I think is really cute oh
okay like I thought it wasn't all gonna
fit in there wow yeah I spent way more
money there cuz I wanted some cute
school supply stuff too and you know
cute stuff comes at a price my friends
now we're starving and our dad made us
pesto pasta and chicken which is like
the amazing ever guys if you watch a
movie tonight we can write and go under
that box

get us to go to Target but like no we're
starving and tired sensitive love before
I didn't know what this song man now I
do know that it means that it's about
cocaine and Blake right there
I can't feel my face you go buddy look

that's what my calves look like just
kidding I wish okay we're gonna look Eco
parting yeah you know I wish I was a dog
save the life hey puppy he says let me
in it is nice okay you can come we had
dinner and then it was really hard we
had to bring him everything inside from
our car and I put it in the living room
I'm kind of like unpack it all organized
I've just been like editing and I impact
and now it's already like 12:15 lol and
I pulled up here on my computer cuz I
think Lucy me might watch it or if we
don't watch a movie we might just watch
like an episode of white collar Netflix
which by the way I finished all of that
with Justin and we're obsessed
Lucy's still watching it so sometimes
I'll just free watch episodes with her
because it's such a good show so
basically coach white collared Neil is
like life so I'm just gonna go to bed
now sorry if today's vlog wasn't
interesting I feel like my last vlog
when I went dorm shopping with Justin
wasn't even that interesting cuz like
it's kind of hard to film in the stores
when you're just picking out like
cleaning supplies like I don't know it's
not that fun and I think most of it was
just me in the car talking or just like
me talking like this so this one is
interesting as some my other vlogs so
thank you guys so much for watching and
I'll see my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
