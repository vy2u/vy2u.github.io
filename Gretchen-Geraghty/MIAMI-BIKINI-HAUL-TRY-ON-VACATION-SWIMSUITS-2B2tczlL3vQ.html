be showing you a bunch of bathing suits
it's just a big huge bathing suit haul
it's awesome it's awful and I'm so
excited to show you all of them because
you guys know me you already know that
like literally all my favorite bathing
suits are from Savile like literally
every single picture of bathing suit
everyone's like oh my god like where's
baby C from and the answer you already
know it's awful literally like that was
bikini the entire time we've been in
Miami right now I'm sitting on our
balcony it's so cute right now it's like
6 p.m. like really good lighting it's
just good times happy vibes and I don't
want to leave tomorrow I'm gonna be so
sad but anyway let's get started so the
first things are going to show you I'm
actually wearing the top right now it's
like literally top I've been like
dinking around all day like to do so
yeah you're right now I've been dicking
around with my little chickens with just
like sweatpants and this is like a top
you know I'm kidding but don't worry I
was wearing it like this bathing suit -
so these are the bombs that go with
they're so cute they're just these like
high-waisted black bottoms and like
can't you see I mean you already saw
like all my pictures on incense up but
all literally that gets your pictures
and like cups of me wearing them
throughout this so you can see what it's
like oh my god that helicopter so rude
right now did you know a YouTube video
but yeah I just looked really cute
together and honestly reminds me of this
white top black bottom with one piece
one that's like pretty expensive I think
it's from like urban or something and
I've been seeing it all over and stuff
but this little looks just like it I
actually like that it's like two pieces
because I'm not as like into one pieces
is two pieces like I like bikinis better
whatever so yeah this is my cheaper
offals like way affordable if you guys
know and I love being able to like tell
like ooh
my bathing suit was awful because
everyone thinks that they're like so
expensive looking but they're like
literally not that bad at all they're
like super affordable so definitely
recommend is like literally all the ones
I'm showing you like me Maggie I'm going
to see like all wears out bikinis
because they're just like the best super
teen
I'm like out of breath I'm done I'm so
quick but yeah ever since my college is
always like oh my gosh like that was so
real I said that everyone in my college
everyone from bu is always like oh my
god like this is the next meeting to you
and this together this is the top it's
just a spread top it's like one shoulder
and I literally got this because Mandy
had it when we were just in a robot and
it looked so cute on her and I was like
where did you get that it looks like
super expensive like you get it from
like Ruby in general like vitamin A like
what someone's further I really love him
Syosset not for being Jonah the other
one Vanilla Sky duh
like I really thought like Frankie's
like I thought it was a cube expensive
she's like I literally bought it on
sample so I was like what like that is
really cute so I got the same one and
red one shoulder and then these are the
little bottoms oh wait I should say
sizing to help you guys okay there you
do the bottoms just like normal
come on why are you doing this to me
normal little bottoms okay
so all of these things you got to medium
and I can see it smells from like
everything from sample and stuff like
that but I think they brought quite
small but like actually Maggie and Emma
will usually get smiles and I still wear
them and I still wear like my small
they're small so I feel like you can try
to be whatever you want so if you want
them like tighter get smiles but then if
you want them to be less to convenience
so I kind of have both but yeah like
this is a medium and it's more like
loose you know and it's not super like
so I kind of like like that so that's
why I have mediums in the
which I am okay and this next one is
royal blue and do you guys remember we
the OGG LP Gretchen viewers will
remember I was obsessed with royal blue
I think it was like a phase in high
school and everything I'm going to have
to be royal blue so this reminds me of
it and I still love it and I just be
like royal blue like blonde hair like I
don't know really like pops I don't know
I don't even blue eyes or anything but
whatever I think it's super cute I love
this style I got it in black last time
from sample like I have it in black
always wear I think it's so cute and it
honestly makes my boobs look really big
and my boobs are gonna be like we're not
tapping but this make them look big so
so like that and then it's just plain
blue a bottoms to go with my got sorry
all of these are like all messed up in a
pile and it's because we've all worn all
of them already so that's like oh my god
this one is literally too wet me and
Maggie Lucy where there's so much it's
okay
these are the bottoms you probably sound
like Maggie's and stuff tonight dosent
myosin I don't even know maybe the top
is so cute like fuckin Herman's one
baby's room is Hall it's probably this
one with the black having two bottoms or
this cuz this I just think is so cute
and so flattering like literally I was
like Maggie look like an angel and that
like this top is just like a super cute
style of top and I really enjoy it and I
relate to print and it actually really
reminds me of this bathing suit I got oh
no I post it in this my Instagram not
just one um but like just the prints of
them kinda remind me of each other but
this one's more like cheetah print and
this is just like random little popular
circles popular that's not right like
ovals circles okay you know what I'm
just gonna shut up okay so this one is
like cheetah print II I think it's just
white with black and I think it's trendy
I feel like I've seen this around on
insta and there is definitely like solo
that places that are like probably like
$200 for this bikini and this is like so
affordable cheap so just strapless
straight across everything I got for
tanning and then the bottoms where I
remember like these ones to do like
cheeky you can see some of their moms
are cheeky and I like that okay this one
I actually wear yet but Lucy Moore and
she's that you reelect in photos so cute
with her and Emily I love this color
again like cheeky bottoms it's like this
rib material and some other rib bones
were like so cool and then the top I
really like the style up because I
really like these straight across tops
for like tanning because then you don't
have like these guys right here I've
been trying to get rid of my strap tan
lines on this trip and it's kind of
worked
I'm like a little little burnt tea but
that's okay
yeah and then just like ties in the back
like so oh and don't worry I've been
wearing sunscreen because I know what oh
my god I still feel like Isis at my head
you're not pay attention to that I know
some people are worried that like I
don't wear sunscreen because I've been
in his Sun literally so much in the past
couple months but I do wear sunscreen
and I do try to be careful about that so
don't worry but you know even if you
wear sunscreen sometimes people get
burned so that's what happens
oh I might also wear this one and really
liked it again it's like the same kind
of green color super cute this is a
little bit darker it's just this soft
material these babies are literally such
good quality especially I would look for
the ones that are like double lines like
they're just like thick and nice
and then the top the top is like this
it's just like a little scoop in the
front in the back I have one side of
this dial - I have a maroon one do you
remember my last alcohol video and a
yellow one and I can never have too many
beans in so don't even comedy like you
have so maybe because I need that many I
live in them we literally live in and we
like haven't worn clothes all we from
here we just wear bathing suits so it's
worth it you know I'm saying okay this
one again like strapless top we didn't
get a chance to wear this one yet
obviously I got on it still but I really
like this strapless top style I bought
it in red as well and I wear the red one
the first a few guys on insta just yet
black strapless top comes with a plain
apply patterns again like cheeky it
looked a really good like double line
material so you know that red being said
I showed you like the one-shoulder I
could think accessing one button black
because I love a style I thought it's
really cute oh man I literally just told
you how like playing drive-by with
banners and they says DJ Camilo and Alex
sensation tonight sorry I won't be there
I have a flattest exam so you'll catch
me like news it and like knocked out at
like 9:00 p.m. okay with it this wooden
shoulder black top
there's another Casely that's hang on
hang on literally that's the first time
I was just telling about plane another
plane right there Jersey Shore
April 5th is Jersey Shore coming on
again oh my god I feel like those
forever goes like those my childhood we
can you guys just like chill for a sec
he's looking finished filming mm-hmm
okay where were we
shall we continue oh did I finish around
this back when shoulders not black
bottoms super cute okay moving on
ding ding ding ding ooh okay
high-waisted bottom's again I didn't
like high-waisted some sea-bottoms until
I tried a couple of these ones like this
white top that goes with those
high-waisted black ones I thought I was
wearing and then this together I was
like wait a minute hey mister bottoms
are like really cute like they're like
Mac you oh my god also I realized
someone come to my video too they're
like you know you've been in Boston too
when you started seeing like mad keen
when I'm mad hungry like I never feel
like I stay mad but I feel like maybe it
does rip off and it's like a Boston
thing I don't know what do you guys say
Maggie and I must say wicked and I'm
like you guys are weird but I think
that's like Cape Cod like Boston thing
also so okay anyway I'm getting very
high attracted these red high sea
bottoms so cute and what I learned in
Miami is I like harvesting bottoms and
it just goes with this little top which
I really love for tanning and not only
is it strapless but I like that I can
skinny in the middle so that when you
wear like tops that go like that a
triangle ones you don't really get
straight across camera and you know so
these are like the actual let's pretend
forgetting this one also super cute red
cheeky bottoms
Maggie wear this one today and it just
ties in front of a yellow one like this
I have a black one like this I might
have a couple more and I just love that
like they're so cute are on they're so
flattering like really cute on a secret
so yeah
oh that's bathing suit okay last but not
least oh this is a tag alright but you
might recognize me in it when I was in
Aruba I actually worked Mandy she has
this exact one for example as well and I
kind of copied her on this one in the
red one because I thought they were so
cute
so I haven't wear this one yet
specifically but I wore whoa but I wore
Mandy's in Aruba so yeah super cute and
then it just has these bottoms to go in
so yeah that is everything from
thoughtful I will have them linked down
