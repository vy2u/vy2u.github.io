super quick before the rest of this vlog
it's gonna be a super fun vlog but I
just wanted to tell you guys about my
Poshmark account I wanted to remind you
of all the clothes I've been listing on
there I've literally been posting like
crazy and I'm gonna do a little screen
recording right now so that you can see
exactly just what I've been posting and
you can see like what it looks like on
the app so here it is oh my friend hand
is helping me sell clothes too and she
changed my little banner banner photo to
a picture of me and Lucy and her and
then my profile picture change as well
but these are just some of the clothes
on there some baby things suits a bunch
of stuff with tags because I just have
so many clothes and those white Levi's
shorts for example I bought and then I
have so many white shorts and I was like
wait like I don't need them just so much
stuff that either doesn't fit me anymore
or that I've worn so much already that
I'm kind of sick over yeah and as you
could tell my username is just Gretchen
with five ends and you should definitely
download the app for free and my link
down in the description box because it's
free I buy clothes on there that are a
lot cheaper I love going on there my
I've said this before too but my
favorite favorite thing about Poshmark
is going on there when there's something
that I want like in the store and then
it sells out or it's just not sold
anymore because he was like an old item
and then I can find out on Polish market
it's cheaper and it's available on there
even when it's not like sold in store
anymore so that's like definitely my
favorite thing about Poshmark
and I remember saying this before but
there's already so many of my favorite
brands on there like lemon Nike Adidas
Michael Kors Louie Vuitton like the list
goes on and on and I like that there's
like luxury brands on there as well
because I know I think it's over $500
that like verified that it's real so
that's like so nice and like obviously
gives you a peace of mind when you're
spending so much money on something so
instead of buy I'm trying to think of
something that's expensive so like maybe
you want under Mesbah ALPA obviously
they're so expensive so I'm sure you can
definitely find some on Poshmark that
are like definitely discounted and
you'll still know that it's real so
that's really thick and you should
definitely share your user names down
below like your closet so I can check
out your clothes as well it's open to
see like what you guys are selling and
yeah like literally
Marcus one of my favorite apps just
scroll through see people are selling
and also just for you guys to if you
feel like here's someone that has like
so many clothes sitting in your closet
that you don't wear whatever I always
find that happening or just clothes that
you've grown out of it's like really
good still in there so yeah I would
definitely recommend having Poshmark
like I said link in the description
don't forget to comment your username
and yeah though further ado let's get on
into the rest of the video good morning
off like Instagram is there and just be
like just don't just don't come back to
Boston I can't tell you how many people
in the past week you've been like do you
like go to be like John my yesterday
like so many people are like do you like
take classes like are you still like a
full-time student
I'm like yeah I just you have class
Monday Wednesday realistically you can
travel a lot I mean it's not realistic
for most people because they like have
stuff to do here and like money and
whatever but like no no I
I mean like if you have like the means
to do it and while I'm still young you
don't have a family to like tie me down
I think about these things like I'm 21 I
want to be married yesterday
like I said wait I never understood like
I was given gone like what does it
matter but then when you were gone one
time I wasn't here I was like I'm sad I
was like this is just like lonely I'll
be like dude I'll be back Saturday
morning okay it is literally 10:30 right
now I got to get the heck out of here
because our flight leaves at 1252 it's
supposed to leave at 452 but we're like
we're not trying to mess with this no we
need to get our butts to Miami so we are
leaving at 12:00 52 now and Maggie and
Emma are on their way I got to go scoop
Lucy we're gonna go to Boston Logan and
that is the plan yeah I just think it is
this open we're traveling together I
never travel with you whoa I don't think
any of our scenes together on this
license we just switch today and there
was like no open seats like they're all
scattered but
it's a short flight yes

then last night I was freaking out and I
was like we should switch it and I
switch it to 12:30 when it's toeses on

oh my god I'm so happy we switch and we
got like the last couple flights on the
plane too oh my god I'm freaking out
