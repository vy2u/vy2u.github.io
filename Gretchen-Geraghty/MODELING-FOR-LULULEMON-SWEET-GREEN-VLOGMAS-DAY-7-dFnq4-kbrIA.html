better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming the town
happy vlogmas day seven everyone and I'm
actually in a rush to get out the door
right now to get to my 9:00 a.m. class
so this little first parts can be it
really quick and I'm making some oatmeal
right now so yeah for breakfast look I
have a dining and playing here at BU
obviously but sometimes I'm too lazy to
go get breakfast in the morning and it's
just easier to make breakfast in my dorm
yum yum yum yum my favorite is the maple
brown sugar one today's question of the
day is leave your comment down below do
you like your oatmeal more watery or
more like thicker and like you know what
I mean watery or thicker let me know I
also put heaps of this justin's almond
butter in it it's just like the vanilla
kind it's seriously so good okay and I'm
gonna leave out so I'm not late to class
this is what I'm wearing it just ELISA
outfit so everyone I am done with my
classes for today and I actually brought
my baldon camera with me today because I
wanted to vlog more when I was out and
about like walking to my classes but I
get kind of embarrassed so I didn't
really do that I just had lunch and I
ate like by myself but I took a picture
of my lunch and here it is in case
you're wondering it's just like this
turkey wrap that I always get they have
a really good like sandwich making bar
here at BU and some pretzel goldfish I
always get those and I had some bananas
and peanut butter every surprised oh and
I was gonna take like a cute little
video of it and be like look I have so
many friends at lunch because they by
myself except then I was too embarrassed
to film you know before I couldn't even
eat by myself so it's baby steps guys
baby steps
now my plan for the afternoon is to take
a nap because I only say I'm gonna take
a nap and then I never actually do but I
mean it like right now I'm going to
because sometimes I stay up really late
editing vlogmas like 3 a.m. sometimes
just because I want to make sure it gets
up for you guys I know you guys really
enjoy blog mez i really hate getting
behind because i'm it's just this
terrible chain of events where you can't
edit them on time blah blah blah I
promised myself I would stay on track
with vlogmas this year so far so good
there's been a few mishaps but you know
we're all human and I decided to do my
laundry yesterday or the day before the
day before that with Makai you guys saw
that and so here's a bunch of clean
laundry and in there because well this
is clean laundry that's dirty which
doesn't really make sense because that's
my hamper but when I do my laundry and
it's clean I bring it back upstairs from
the laundry room and my Hamburg but then
I have to put it away and I've been too
lazy to put it away so it's just right
there and all on my bed so I have to put
away my laundry and then my dirty
clothes can finally go in the hamper
like they're supposed to instead of on
the ground so yeah and our chem lab exam
is today and I'm kind of nervous and
like right now I know what I know I'm
not really gonna learn anything else so
yeah pray for Gretchen oh my gosh guys
Lucy told me there's a new sweet green
opening tonight in the Prudential Center
which is like weird to me because the
Prudential Center is like really really
close to Newberry and there's like one
or two sweet greens I'm pretty sure like
on Newberry I know there's at least one
and we go to it all the time so I don't
know maybe it's just like in high demand
so they're opening another one but we
plan on going to the opening of it
tonight so hopefully it'll be like
really fun I'll bring you hours along of
course if you don't know what sweet
green is it's basically just a really
really yummy salad place on Newbury
Street I know they have it in like
cities I'm not really sure where else
they have it they like they probably
have in like New York City maybe like LA
and stuff but it's just like so yummy
like I don't know they just have so many
like fresh ingredients and they have
salads that are like on the menu that
you can order that they make like all
the time and you can also like make your
own I'm like talking about a lot right
now but like you'll see if we go later
and yeah it's just seriously so yummy we
go like all the time it's like our
favorite restaurant ever it's like
casual it's like I would say the formal
miss of like Chipotle you know you just
like go to the counter and order and get
your food but it's so yummy
maybe we'll get ice cream after oh my
gosh if we're near Newberry we can get
vending Jerry he's that's like our
favorite and now I'm stressed that my
fingers are like on the speakers because
the vlogger sites going up today like
vlogmas day 6 the one part where I'm
like freaking out over a boy that's why
the title of it is like my celebrity
crush even though
don't even say who it is mm-hmm it's
Channing Tatum let's just say like oh my
god he's so freaking cute but anyway um
so if you're wondering like who that was
about
yeah it's Channing Tatum but Taylor's
fingers were like over the speakers and
like I know I've done that sometimes too
so I don't even know where the speaker
or not even the speaker's like the
microphones are on yeah oh my gosh I've
been filming forever I'm actually gonna
put away my clothes and take a nap now
