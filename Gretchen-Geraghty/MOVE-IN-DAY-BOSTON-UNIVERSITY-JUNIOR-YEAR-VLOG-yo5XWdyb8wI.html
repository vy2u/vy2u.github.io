I can see the soccer view here's my
menses on what used to be loosing my
vlog channel which is now just her
channel she actually got a Lisa full
size mattress back at home and I was so
jealous that she got one because it was
so comfy and I'm like I want one so now
I got Lisa mattress and thank you so
much Lisa for sponsoring this video it
means so much to me I'm so happy
mittigar good morning everyone so this
is the tweets beginning of my moving day
vlog for bu at 2017 woo I'm actually so
excited to go back like I cannot wait to
see everyone we're actually pretty close
right now we're getting stuck in some
crappy suit but um yeah as you can tell
my car is filled to the brim with my
stuff I am again the living in gp2 this
year diamond and a permit this time
instead of a suite so it's super
exciting a little bit kitchen I can cook
food in
with me if you could have noticed just
me and mommy Lucy is in Paris for this
semester studying abroad so it miss her
dearly it was good for me packing the
car because instead of two people's
things we just had one but yeah I went
through so much and he says I can be
super different this without her I know
I'm wearing a lot of makeup right now
you're probably like why are you wearing
that makeups like moving on their stuff
today and you're probably like year so
it's true
but when I was doing my makeup in the
car my eyeliner was like getting
everywhere and it was really thick and
I'm like I'm just gonna put on fake
eyelashes like covered up and I'm not
even kidding
thank eyelashes was easier than just
putting on mascara in the car cuz
mascaras already because I just like
stuck them on so yeah we're turning
right onto common though right now and
you nervous mommy
you move in expect delays yes sounds
about right
are you going a little freshman again
freshman year I was like peeing my pants
oh and also I lost my David Yurman
necklace for like a week and then last
night when I was finishing packing I
finally found it so I think that was a
good omen
you're gonna kill me you don't even want
to this I mean there's gonna be a whole
new class of people I just realized like
freshmen do b2 is right there hmm okay
warning you guys I'm in that really big
tail building right there so I don't
know how much I'm gonna be able to
actually over log right now because
we're gonna be really busy unpacking
this whole car so I'll try to get some
footage whoa
this is our first trip of probably five
is my guess how many more do we think
two more I think so too
this view from this floor which shall
not be disclosed because I've never one
will know where I live is so nice all
right guys this is my view mmm here I'll
show you kind of like before we put some
stuff in my closet already there's my
rug my room's really little so it kind
of takes up the whole thing but it's
okay because my view is worth it and I
keep being about to say the floor I'm on
but I guess I'm just not even gonna say
it because you guys already know what
building them in put there is the river
obviously and then I have like the
corner room so then it goes like this
and it's kind of just like dirt and like
railroad right there but then I can see
the soccer field to watch my boy play as
well oh my gosh I also can see other
people's windows were there and spine
people this is like the best little area
and those are the three freshmen dorms
at BU there's rich Claflin and sleeper
and I was enriched my freshman year and
you guys want to see Taylor's room okay
they're gonna be like what in the heck
I'm telling you right now Taylor's room
is so big I mean you can just tell like
look at how much room it has why is it
so dark
oh yeah there you can see see how much
bigger it's okay I'll just hang out in
here a lot
my room can be really cozy no way it's
really cute it has a lot of the same
it says last year and I love it and
Taylor has a whole wall of windows yep
oh my gosh this is nice too cuz I think
you might be able to see farther that
way this is like the best you ever take
that's right over the highway I can't
wait to do an apartment tour because I
wanted to do a sweet tour yeah last year
I never did a sweet to her yes and while
everyone's still clean because like last
year I wanted to and I was waiting for
everyone to clean their rooms on the
same day but obviously with 8 people
it's way harder to coordinate oh yeah
there's a Lucy's naps in Paris I told
everyone that she's in potty Hollywood
with all my stuff and we have to go get
my full-size bed to put together soon
shout out Lee for taking my twin bed
that was in here love you homie wouldn't
be able to do without you and my hug is
really dirty from being in New York this
summer but we'll just cover it with my
bed now we just make grocery shopping
from i thanks mommy and we're going to
try to walk here and good thing we
donate so we have a full cart full of
groceries and I may be eating lunch and
I decided that we should be on the dirty
carpet because there are common room is
so nice but since it still does aminos
it's really hot and he's kind of tired
and high so buddy because we've just
been moving stuff around all day and I
just want to lay down in my bed but I
still have to build it so I'm eating
Carrie sorry though after I ate my
sandwich and my mama's you do she was
look I just took a bite of all of that
and then couldn't finish them but I'm
like why don't you just finish what I
said taking a bite of all that there's
all these little nuggets carrots real
picking around on a plate right mom
here's my
and free mommy this is one camera and we
got a big so we can bring them up I just
have to show them my battle scars like
like okay warning if you guys don't like
blood don't watch this right now just
skip over like 30 seconds because I have
to show you when I was just bringing up
my Lisa mattress in my bed frame in this
little pin
I had a mishap with the big my you
really hard you know there's blood
everywhere okay really want to see you I
think it was doing my ankles hacked like
machete we have to go back to the
beginning for you mom I just want you to
say the way you say it's really funny if
you wanna do me and mommy just finish
putting together my bed frame let me
show you so it pretty much takes up my
whole room but that is okay with me
because I knew I wanted a full-size bed
and here's my okay let's have a chat so
I don't know if you guys saw but on what
used to be Lucy's my love channel which
is now just her channel she actually got
a least a full size mattress bang at
home and I was so jealous that she got
one because it was so comfy and I'm like
I want one so now I have Lisa mattress
thank you so much Lisa for sponsoring
this video it means so much to me
because obviously I mean obviously if
you guys don't know but listen I both
have back injuries from rowing we both
have some herniated disk issues and we
were just researching like really good
mattresses that we want to have and Lisa
is what are the best mattresses and also
it's so nice is that it comes in this
box and I'm just looking by myself like
it's not that hard it comes like really
compact and it's like vacuum packed in
there and you take it out and I just
kind of like expands and I know all
about it now says I hope to see you
unbox hers and yeah I'm just so excited
to have a really nice mattress in
college because
and I really know the importance of like
a good mattress and how important that
is for your back and obviously you spend
a lot of the day sleeping so mattresses
are obviously really good investments
and everything before I forget to
mention I don't have it linked down
below so you guys can get $100 off of
your lease the mattress so just check
the description box but you're
interested and yeah I feel like it's
really good if you're in college too
because they'll just ship it right to
you if you have room for a full size bed
or you can get a twin bed or queen bed
or king bed - they have all of them
obviously I'm really excited and I'm
gonna throw it on my brain now and yes
it's been so long so it's just so good
to have this out of the way to be able
to sleep on it I'm gonna sleep so well
tonight because I'm so tired and yeah
just wait you'll see how cool it is when
it like expands like it literally like
just expands all the air and age so soft
and comfy so I definitely recommend and
I can fit I'm ready cuz Lucy and I slept
on Harry's a couple nights and it was
really awesome
oh they even have twin XL - if you guys
made a twin XL
whoever charge or friend next yeah I got
to make my bed
that's the insert yes who April's in
there yeah I'm so happy mittigar this is
before I put up any decorations and I'm
waiting for so many like pictures from
society6 so I don't want to put anything
on the walls until I get older I was
like doesn't even really need it it's so
soft without hands looking so Joey any
day so I'm saying this is rain playlist
wait how many crawl inside my oh my god
why are you the smartest person ever
I literally would dread doing this like
I wouldn't do it for like days I would
just sleep with the insert by itself
you're so smart
innovation I'm not even kidding I would
lay this out and go with this with my
head and go in and like spread out the
debate she just showed me how to do it
super easy
do you know how she showed me that all
you have to do is put the corners in and
shake down and I'll cover it over the
Dubey insert</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
