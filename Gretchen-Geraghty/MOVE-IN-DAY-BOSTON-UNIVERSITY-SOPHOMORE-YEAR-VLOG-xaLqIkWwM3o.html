by the title this is just going to be me
moving into my Boston University suite
this year and I did one of these moving
into my freshman year and this video has
been so requested everyone's like please
show you moving in for your sophomore
year so that is what I'm doing pass
trousers in a freshman dorm I had a
roommate Micaiah and this year we're not
rooming together I think I'm just gonna
answer some questions I know I will get
on this video if you're new to my
channel don't forget to subscribe so you
can see when I post new videos and yeah
I think it's just right down below click
it go ahead yep so yeah my freshman
roommate was micaiah and I didn't know
her before bu but we just met when we
got there and she's from California I
love her to bits and we actually wanted
to be in the same suite for our
sophomore year but unfortunately our
housing fell through so we had to like
find other plans and we're kind of
scrambling like last-minute and I got
pretty lucky I ended up in a suite I'm
just gonna tell you where Lucy and I are
living we're living in steuby too
I don't know I might add that I'm kind
of scared now because I don't know I
want people to know I'm living but
basically we're in a really nice new
dorm building at BU it's only feel like
upperclassmen or I guess like sophomore
junior senior not freshman but Lucy and
I both got in like last minute like
luckily and we actually ended up in
Suites across the hall from each other
so I know you guys are gonna ask like
are you manga Lucy where's Lucy Beauvoir
so we actually want to be the same sweet
just like Lucy me Micaiah and Lucy's
freshman roommate Anna we all want to be
in the same suite and we thought we were
but then it fell through so I'm in a
suite that is across the hall from
Lucy's so it's good because we'll have
our own space but again we're across it
all just like we were freshman year if
you guys know also Taylor's in my suite
I know you guys know Taylor so you'll
probably see some of her in this vlog oh
if you're gonna ask about my necklace
I just got it from Urban Outfitters and
I really like its new today's the first
day I'm wearing it do you like it I just
think it's really like simple and it
goes down like that and Mandy's friend
Kat had it and Mandy and Kat were
wearing it I was like leave it so I'll
this link down below so you can check it
out birgisson
yeah I'm really excited this is my sofa
I'm happy that I'm not a freshman
anymore so I like know what to expect
and what it's like and I'm so excited to
be living in like a nice suite that's
new in yours air conditioned and not
like a crappy freshman dorm you know if
it's past six we got to get going so
we're still waiting to leave and I
thought I would just show you my outfit
while we're waiting some lazy day
outfits for moving into college all I
have left to grab is his backpack with
me and yeah so basically I was playing
I'm wearing like an athletic outfit like
a little tank top and like Lulu crops
but then I was like you know it might
even be more comfortable to wear like
nice Letta clothing and like a normal
shirt with just really comfy joggers and
this is like a really light mint green
just t-shirt I don't even know where
it's from and then these black joggers
I've been so obsessed with recently no I
showed these in a vlog recently because
I just love them they're just like the
conveys material ever and they've these
really comfy pockets oh yeah they're
from one piece which I didn't even hear
before but I got like a onesie from them
and I saw these and I was like ooh those
look comfy and I'm obsessed with them
they're my new favorite pants I love
them and they're like slouchy at the
bottom but yeah clearly I'm obsessed I
can't like shut up about them and oh
yeah also I want to mention you guys
what's also is really really cool
I might get excited I'd talk to us if
you didn't know okay flip it back to me
so also what's really cool is that these
are actually part of unities which if
you guys don't know it's like basically

student discounts off of like all your
favorite like clothing stores and just
not even clothing stores like more than

Panasonic I know they have so many and
also you have this new backpack from
Fall Robin I hope I'm saying that right

moving into my dorm room guys I'm
running back upstairs before we leave
because I forgot one important thing the
most important thing saying goodbye to
my doggies I'm literally gonna miss Ozzy
and Teddy so much guys it's crazy and
the next time that we see them try using
me so much better he's been growing like
seriously crazy then taking one last
look around cuz I'm known for leaving
thing behind hmm I think I'm good I
always forget the random and stuff like
water bottles or wait did I grab my
water bottles oh my gosh I didn't see it
told you guys look what else I scored
with my water bottle peanut butter and
dates my favorite I know my parents
won't eat them so I'm gonna eat them and
we're off okay cool ooh
guys I have a secret want to know what I
did it's really bad oh look at my lamp I
decided to steal for my room that's
normally in my room at home but then I
just decided that I was going to steal
and put in my dorm room oh this is a
Nutella you what I did that was really
bad I didn't go to bed last night
because I had a lot to do daddy's not
impressed I know I'm probably gonna be
total grump later and like get sick like
my throat kind of feels a little iffy so
it's definitely my fault if I get sick
find your sin so much to do into a
little time and it's really funny that
it's daytime already because the night
went really good
that's what people always yell at me
they're like do you not wear a seat belt
but I do but what happens is I usually
start vlogging before this car starts
moving and then I starts moving and then
I prayed upon my signal we are about 20
minutes away how you feeling my oh
sleepy me to where you can tell my voice
oh my gosh this is so bad everyone thing
I'd like to stick or something I'm
really not sick I just haven't slept in
like it over a day well I was trying to
think of more questions you guys might
have about us living here at our living
situation because I feel like people are
always getting confused
I said before Lucy and I didn't work out
the same sweetie so we're across the
hall for each other we each have a
single which I'm so excited for check
out my own it's like I loved it living
with a guy and everything but like just
having your own space is gonna be nice
you know but I'll still like being into
sweet with all your friends around
really close and like I feel like it's
like the best of both worlds it'll be
interesting to see how all of our stuff
fits because I would say we're both over
Packers well actually no not you that
much but me definitely a good front
along yeah well I helped with a lot of
stuff like that I didn't bring last year
yeah well my medicine volumize cancer
you think the minivan was fuller last
year I thought so too
I thought we tried to downsize this year
but like packing I'm like oh my gosh
like we really get back so much so yeah
guys the New Balance building we're
getting close
yeah
really I didn't even know that since
when is that like didn't you like
practice arena or something stopping to
every semester I was so nervous last
year I was like peeing my pants remember
now I'm just excited Lucy didn't we walk
to that stop and chop with you and me
and Anna oh my gosh there's our big
about our boat hug yes
that's to be cheery there I don't know
if I should say where we're living in
this video dad should I say it okay it's
a big building we're living in to be to
like how sick is that I'm so excited
it's so big and nice and it's gonna feel
like a hotel
compared to rich haul ass here like my
tall wasn't horrible or anything it's
just obviously like freshman dorms like
no air conditioning and they're small
and cramped and older and that one's
nice and new they'd be so excited
yay I love that hotel Doubletree that
just reminds me when we were younger and
we see the erythema mommy and stuff so
fun
see you soon home park guys look at all
our building years it's so tall
yes I'm only
yeah you guys were uncommon Wawa you

cyclists it dies and we're closed
this is so weird I feels like I've been
here forever well it has been like I
guess four months this is so crazy I
remember driving up this way last year I
was like that feels like yesterday
though it's so weird
for sure that's oh you kept saying to me

to go all the way up guys this is what
it looks like when you walk in and
here's my single right here we can't get

to figure that out
Taylor's room oh that's so right thank

exciting so there's all my stuff waiting
to be put in my single
because we can't get it open no you get
here we have to go I'm gonna tell the
vlog what's going on
daddy's vlogging - I'm a hobo okay guys
only me seriously only me so basically I
can't get in to my room because the key
didn't work and they said they changed
the locks I mean we tried the old key
that didn't work and then we tried the
master key which is supposed to open
every single door on my floor today work
so the locksmith is coming hopefully I
can sleep in my room tonight it's really
frustrating that I can't get in and I
feel bad because I'm taking over my
entire common room like look at that
mess people in my suite are probably
gonna kill me I like so much other stuff
everywhere but yeah camera phone where
can we put your like okay I'm gay I'm
helping now yes guys the Lockman came
and now I can get into my room oh and
this is what it looks like before I
almost don't even want to show you in
progress because I know this place is
about to like explode with all my stuff
I just want to show you like a pretty
after and I plan on setting it up
exactly like Taylor because I really
like the way hers came out and what's
really funny is the top little thing
that all comes with our desks the Scott
actually took the light off the top and
there's just like a light on the bottom
and she made him took a shoe rack under
her bed like how innovative I think so
great was time to do this crap in my
room most awful thing about good morning
guys so I know I like stopped vlogging
in straight basically if you caught in
my blog I said I stayed up all night so
I was basically like a wreck all day
yesterday moving in and I'm not even
really that I'll moved in right now I
still have a bunch of stuff I was
actually put on the walls because
there's like not that much and I kept
waiting to vlog they want to show you
after I set it up more but then I
figured that sort of room tours for so
I'm gonna show you everything that I
unpacked yesterday cuz it's obviously
it's like the next morning and I watch
it with the gym so excuse my look good
morning sweetie
I'm talking myself okay so I'm the front
of my door I'd this JLP side I tailor
help me put up and shout out Christiana
I love it and this has been like in my
doorman last year then I brought it back
home and put in my normal room because I
love it and it's my life so yeah closet
this is like a ready sort of a dorm tour
but obviously it's like not that set up
yet
and I have lunch of trash right there
this is looking pretty gross but I'm
about to go to gyms five this stuff out
this is what I live to give to Lucy
because it's our favorite and I got a
bunch sorry my voice is like God these
are some Christmas lights I'm going to
put up I don't know if I mentioned it
yesterday I have like two or three
strands my dorm room last year and I
lost them so these are next one that
we'll see at and then I just ordered two
more that are coming here's some command
strips and like hooks because I have to
hang stuff up still this is a bracelet
organizer at gym put anything on yet got
like my perfume oh it's not really
organized pretty yet though okay this is
like a mess but I have some plan so what
I'm gonna put right here a bunch of
these photos I'm gonna make him took a
little gallery wall then I got like a
garment rack to put clothes on I think I
might put it there there I just gotta
figure out where if it this is another
sign I want to hang up think I'm gonna
hang the New York City one it's just
like the New York City skyline except
it's like massive like I got the size
large because I didn't notice eyes to
get and it is like way too big so I
might have to hang it like up on my
ceiling down on the side of my wall so I
don't know also a really good thing I
like about this single as compared to
like my double last year is that there's
drywall instead of like concrete like
well so it's like easier to post up up I
feel like and then this is my desk which
is also like work in progress because
it's top bar I'm actually going to take
all the way off so it's just like an
open desk and I have like my jewelry and
all this stuff I gotta like figure out I
stole my lamp from home which i think is
funny oh yeah I had to say some dates
and peanut butter yeah I think that's
OPI gone on so far I have like a bunch
of crap under there that I have like
organized better like bags shoes like
these are the shoes I brought in this
whole bin and I have more like a mess
and I'm obsessed with the way this
headboard looks I'm so happy I got it
so there's my um normal in case you're
wondering what I also like about this
bed - is that a quick nice
up is my bed for masteries I don't have
like literally running job cuz I thought
I'd see before oh wait I want to show
you my view today I show you yesterday
isn't it so nice when I'm selling
tailors if you can tell the inside of
the window is clean but the outside is
kind of dirty so I'm like I wish someone
would come and clean the outside of the
window but it's still really pretty
especially at night so pretty I guess
that is it for my moving vlog I hope you
guys enjoyed yesterday was kind of a
mess I don't even know if I ever told
you but I tried different keys we tried
the master key didn't work so eventually
the locks and it had to come and now my
room so better which is good and I'll
probably just leave it and walk to
anyway like within my suite you know cuz
yeah but yeah as always if you guys have
any questions leave them down below and
thanks so much for watching I'll see you
my next video bye I already said goodbye
but I thought I'd include this little
gem we're going to Tim good morning Kate
