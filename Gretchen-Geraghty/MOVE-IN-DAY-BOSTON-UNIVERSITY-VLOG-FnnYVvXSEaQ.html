straightening her hair it already looks
straight to me it's very straight
actually so today's the big day
does it feel surreal to you because it
feels surreal to me because we've been
just like banging on it for so long
and now it's finally here today today we
move into college and you'll probably
catch me like crying later or something
like it'll hit me at the rent of his
times I just start thinking about it
sorry I have a sick button right now I
have to straight my hair but yeah we
just like think about the randomized
times and start crying but now okay I'm
excited I'm nervous to you though this
vlog he's been requested so much because
you guys want to see what it's like when
I first move in and I think like
afterwards morning right so I actually
was going to do another dorm room haul
video like I did early on in the summer
but I just didn't have time to another
dorm room hall and this stuff I got the
second time was like way way way more
stuff and it was taking forever to like
filmed it all so I just figured I would
show you guys the rest of the stuff I
got for my dorm room when I do my dorm
room tour because it'll all be in there
obviously so yeah that's why I only had
one dorm room Hall cuz I don't remember
where we'll be coming soon I love how
I'm saying that I haven't even gotten
there yet we have kind of like a long
drive to college and then yeah we'll be
at BU I feel so surreal my roommates
already there cuz she's from California
and she sent me picture the room and it
looks nice it might be a little well
actually I'm pretty sure it's little all
freshman dorms are like little most of
the time but yeah sorry if I don't make
sense to Jay because I'm like so tired
my parents like go to bed early and I
literally have like 3:30 I got at 5:30
so yeah and if you really tired probably
cranky today um but you know I just have
a lot to do when you're leaving you have
stuff to do so anyways I'm excited I'm
nervous it feels so weird like college
has always been like in the future you
know like the end goal and now it's here
my mommy and Lucy
whoa we had to take two separate cars
because look how packed our van is in
his vans like huge and then to my mom's
drinking her car - goodbye
my daddy films Home Videos - you filming
for GOP I think that's right how started
all right cut off the college by yeah
she gets there Susan e if you're making
she wants to share with us toe and stuff
forget all that stuff I get my foot it
off Mary area fishin know I repack like
stuff I packed I put inside of each
other I put all my socks and underwear
inside my shoes because I brought two
suitcases of shoes and then I put all my
socks underwriter in there and then
night drawers like my white drawers I
put stuff I didn't even belong in there
that just put fate in there
to save space my daddy taught me a
blueberry muffin you're my favorite
update we're like a half an hour away
and I'm starting to get nervous aren't
you nervous did you miss me
I've been editing some videos for y'all
as usual I'm behind on my videos and I
have a lot to catch up on
but I'm thinking I'll have lots of free
time but I get all settled in I'd be you
well actually not a lot but maybe so
hopefully enough to keep editing videos
any day every help Lucy my mom left at
the same time as us they're like 20
minutes ahead of us because they're like
flying down the highway I don't know
they must feature having really fast so
they are like 10-15 minutes away but
yeah we slept like half an hour and I'm
getting Roos I feel butterflies in my
tummy what do you say
yeah
I cut the inside of my mouth now we're
here it's cut
oh there this is where Mario is from -
video weren't going like this the whole
time by the way for any of you that saw
my wisdom teeth video I'm pretty sure I
don't you think the reason I got that
terrible and like the reason I have
really bad fevers for that infection in
my mouth right so are you pretty sure
the reason I had the infection is
because I kept touching my mouth after
probably so the reason I was really sick
of teeth and had that like 105 degree
fever was all my fault because I kept
touching my mouth for those of you saw
my wisdom teeth - video wasn't tooth
video isn't teeth video isn't eath cuz
you're 4 okay almost there oh look this
is my new Cup
I wanted to show you guys it's by the
brand contigo and you should get it
because Justin's mom had it and I
thought it was so cool because it has
two layers so it doesn't get
condensation on the outside even if it's
really cold really hot or whenever you
get connotation so that's cool
and also there's like a little lever I
don't know if you can see inside the cup
okay when you pull it out look at it
like closes and then when you put it
back in it opens so that when the lever
is closed
like if you take the straw out you can
just throw the whole bottle in like your
gym bag or something and it'll stay
closed but just so awesome yeah so I
really like this it's a cool idea
oh my gosh we're so true jobs I know the
Double Tree Hotel means you're close
that's like right as you get into Austin
and then the BU campus is just like
right there right
skyline future home yes

than I thought it would be I'm not
homesick cuz I thought it would be my
best comfortable and I'm getting settled
pretty well so enlistees you look so
good guys hey guys so it's actually like
two or three days after when I first
moved in and yeah I've just been waiting
to like talk about it because it's been
taking me just so long to get everything

to being where I wanted to look when I'm
done I slept like organize a lot of
things and get a couple other things
like see right there in my closet I had
I actually just had like two minutes ago

current and they give you I took it off

was just like an ugly tan on like my
roommate has a pretty one with flowers
by the way like my roommates don't nice

along super well so that's really
awesome and Lucy and my friend Taylor
