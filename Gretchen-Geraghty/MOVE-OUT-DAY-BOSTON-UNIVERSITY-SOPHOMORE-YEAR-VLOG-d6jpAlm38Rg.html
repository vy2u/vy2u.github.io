do you try on all your knives like this
put some spider on the slide what
still clip hey guys so this is going to
be the beginning of my moving out day
vlog for bu and it's so surreal that
it's ready here I can't believe it
today is actually a Tuesday night and I
move out tomorrow Wednesday May 10 but I
wanted to get this vlog rolling today
because it's going to be a very hectic
next two days since I have a final a
tonight six day and then tomorrow 60 I
want to give you guys a little overview
it's very messy right now but I haven't
really felt like cleaning it especially
since I am moving out my little closet
oh it's funny because I filled my room
is so different now since I filmed my
room tour since I rearranged everything
own while we are at it this is reminding
me this side right here is the last bag
of envelopes filled with you guys's
bracelets that I'm shipping out to you
guys for those of you that donated I
have about 20 envelopes to just finish
shipping out today and I know those of
you that are waiting for your bracelets
have been waiting patiently for so long
I'm sorry it's been taking me so long
but a lot more people enter than I
thought and I've had hundreds and
hundreds of envelopes to ship out and
yesterday I was at the post office for
hours because they only let you do 10 at
a time and you have to get back in line
and wait again basically it's just
taking me forever but I am doing my best
and I have that last bag today so if you
guys don't have your bracelets by the
time you're watching this video just
shoot me a DM on Instagram be like hey I
never got my bracelets and I'll figure
it out from there but I know I got some
emails and some angry messages of people
saying that they donated and they're
still waiting for the bracelets but you
should have them by now but basically I
just got back from SoulCycle this
morning I want to nati be my big it was
so fun and then we went to a juice press
after and got really good acai bowls oh
my gosh they're acai bowls are so good
with coconut on top mmm and we went to
this whole cycle in Beacon Hill if
Johnny he's so good I love him get some
really good moves today I really like
today's class and I just had kombucha
for the first time after SoulCycle I've
never had it
I got synergy organic kombucha cosmic
cranberry and it was good it's like not
what I thought it was me at all I didn't
know was gonna be like so bubbly I
thought it was gonna be like tea but
Yohn wasn't even playing I'm so tired I
just had my accounting final and while I
should be studying for my information
systems one I gotta start packing
because my room is full still and I have
so much stuff I think I'm really under
estimating how long that's gonna take me
and I'm leaving tomorrow night right
after my six day final so yeah gotta
start packing
I'm all over it up a conversation with
trust me and trust me I'll give it a
just bounce in my hands so upend the man
on the jukebox then we started dancing
now singing like girl you know I want
your love your love was handmade for
somebody like me coming now follow my
lead I may be crazy don't mind me see
boy let's talk too much grab almost look
at the difference I got so much packed
in that little amount of time so proud
of myself so obviously it's a nice
morning and I just got back from getting
my eyelashes done they turned out so
good this time I love them Kate even
Kate the technician that always does
them for me even was like taking
pictures this time she's like wow that
came out really good I'm taking pictures
so you like the way that turned out and
I literally covered my face in bronzer
so it looks like so dark like who am i
oh my god it looks like patchy right
there I'm not that good at putting on
makeup anyway I want to show you guys
the progress I made last night if you
can't tell by how echoey it isn't hear
how empty it looks I made a lot of
progress I still have to take this down
this is gonna be the saddest but this is
what we're looking at how sad guys so
obviously I still have some random stuff
I took off everything in my clothing
rack but then my shower disappointed I
like coming up my towel there yeah all
of these are empty these are empty I
have to take the stuff out of my fridge
I have to pack my blender it's a good
thing I saved the box it's under there
there's McAfee stuff obviously like all
my bedding all the walls and everything
are so bare you guys are not ready to
see the hallway in the common room I
assume it's probably went to kill me but
I'm like don't worry guys I'm leaving
tonight but like I don't understand how
I physically fit so much stuff in here
like ready okay
so this is all my dirty clothes that I
didn't feel like doing before I left so
I'm just gonna do at home and it's free
at home so that's better then we get to
this little thing which has like my
pajamas and stuff there's a bunch of
envelopes and bracelets that I sent out
to you guys those are left over it was
just Katie and Emma's birthday so it's
decorated really pretty in our common
room I wish those there like all year
because it looks really cool but look
it's almost okay first you're gonna kill
me okay so this is blanket and I wrapped
blankets carefully around do you guys
remember the gallery wall I had right
here I had to take all those down and
had so many glass pictures and like
clocks and stuff that I had to like
wrapping blanket so I thought that was a
good way to do it I have like dishes in
here
oh I bunch of like lotions and shampoo
and stuff like that that I was scared
was gonna get squished in like a soft
container so I put it in these hard
boxes all these are so pretty by the way
they're like the nesting boxes from Kate
Spade I love them
I've school seven there I have close the
big issue is clothes if you can't tell
and these are just some of my shoes more
of my shoes headboard pictures I don't
even know what I put in the suitcase
there's like Christmas lights and all my
tapestries in there my yoga mat my
roller this is my hiking bag for Africa
so I started packing some stuff that I
had here that I know I'm going to bring
to Africa clothes exhibit one more
clothes more clothes more clothes these
are just all the hangers that I had all
my clothes on pillows Kate and then I
decided I was going to put all my
clothes on here and buy trash bags today
which I just bought from Starr so
hopefully those kind will work to just
throw on my clothing because I thought
that would be a lot quicker and I still
have my studio lights over there and
like a bring light down there that I
have to pack up and then all of my
clothes weren't fitting there so I put
more there and yeah it's just a crazy
time I just have way more stuff than I
thought I did I would say like 3:00 a.m.
