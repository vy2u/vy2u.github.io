moving out of Boston University vlog if
you guys watched my moving into BU vlog
I actually did it the other day and I
got a lot of like positive feedback on
that and people were really interested
my dad text me and was like watching you
have to do moving out while it'll be
like super interesting so I was like
alright well I haven't really started
packing up my stuff I'm leaving it
tomorrow and this is like if you guys
have like seen my room before see my
other videos like my Boston room tour
move-in vlog I'll have my college room
tour and like moving to beYOU vlog like
list it down below and my roommate left
really late last night she's from
California I'm so sad Makai is gone it
looks so sad on her side and so empty
this is totally off topic but if you're
interested I came in in the fall as a
biology major hated it was miserable I
could not handle bio and chem like if
you're a freshman that's going to take
bio and chem don't do it like don't take
them together if you really want to
major in violent - because I thought I
knew changed my mind but if you know you
want to do bio I highly highly highly
recommend splitting up chem and by oh do
not take them in the same semester you
will have to like three-hour labs a week
like it's just like a lot to handle
especially for a semester so don't do
that so yeah basically a second semester
worked out a lot better I'm like
transferring into the business school
business for me is just a lot better
look I realize that's what I actually
like doing and it's a lot more
interesting so I really would recommend
business it's like hard work like I also
had to work really hard to get the
grades I did but I didn't mind as much
as that makes sense because I feel like
it's important and I'm actually
interested in it so I really really
enjoyed business and yeah I'm excited to
keep going in business and I'm just
gonna start packing it's like probably
like five ish and Lucy Mira do get salad
soon we've defendable our dining
poinsettias since we have a bunch left
over this is before I'm so sad I don't
want to move out of here I don't wanna
like change so this is can be super sad
packing up all my stuff
you
and all the sunshine gotta love the rain
go where the wind blows let it show the
way open all the windows letting all the
light you can pull the stars down be the
perfect skies so glowing write your song
the world will sing
that's my to a
progress kind of this is what I'm proud
of though I packed up a bunch of my
clothes in there and in my hamper I'm
gonna put a bunch and put on my shoes in
there that old dressers empty took down
all of that it looks so weird oh so I
can take to him there we go
I only ripped off a little bit of paint
right there in there with the poster I
had hopefully I don't get charged hehe
lose he's cutting us up an avocado since
they didn't have avocado left to put in
our salads but these salads are the bomb
for those of you that go to bu if any of
you do look at your hat your opu doubt
yeah my really awesome avocado and hmm
you like spend up all Lucy's dining
points we got a bunch of like nuts and
just like random stuff uh-huh Wow MST
blasted head and I didn't know you could
cut an avocado with a plastic knife but
you can life hack oh I have my farm yes
he loves avocado I just realized
something
we have the semester we always gets out
we never stay here anything we always
bring back to her dorm a don't get out
because we're not using
okay I'm gonna have a whole half of an
avocado there
haha these like 11:45 I can't believe it
got so late I'm so tired and like sweaty
okay update want to see everything I've
done so I know like right here doesn't
really look like much but like I said
did I even tell you my friend Amy told
me that it's so smart like all your
clothes that are on hangers you just lay
down flat like in these moving bins when
you're moving out and then you can just
lay them down flat in your car which is
like so nice and you can just pop this
up on top of them that way you don't
have to actually please take them off
the hangers and put them back on it so
when you get home like it saves so much
time and then yeah that's that this
little bin is gonna get moved out I
already moved out my other one right
there my desk doesn't look like much has
been done or that little stuff right
there but actually everything inside the
desk all the drawers are empty so that
is good and then all of those are empty
look at that how weird does that look
everyone so we like how to take my
beauty fades Pizza is forever sticker
yeah so that's empty empty empty empty
look at that Wow having Micaiah not here
when I'm unpacking actually makes it
kind of easier so I can like all this or
that's packed I can just like put over
on her side but I have a little cloth
bag of clothes one two three four like
massive garbage bags of clothes and this
thing is all shoes and other stuff
hamper with more stuff pictures those
are pillows and sweatpants and it's
other stuff yeah and I really can't
believe I'm moving at tomorrow we're
gonna go have a sleepover and Lucy's
room with me and Taylor literally
nothing has changed since high school
you didn't know Annie Taylor him and
Lucy obviously I'm at high school
together and one know it's funny did I
mention this earlier how we all ended up
on the same floor freshman year like
isn't that just so funny they all came
from the same school and we're all best
friends and we ended up on the same
floor in the same building like I don't
know it's just so crazy to move I'm
pretty proud with what I've accomplished
I'm in a good spot to get going tomorrow
because I didn't want to just be like
rushing and like crazy psychopath train
evacuating tomorrow so it so I packed
most of my stuff today and
Oh Lucy this present recently and I just
like never gave it to her somebody could
give it to her now and see what she
thinks it's this I wish my college uh oh
