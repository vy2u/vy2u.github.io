tomorrow but we leave like 12:30 so
we're like going to the airport tonight
you know so it's gonna be really long
day and we're gonna go it's like the
market thing and that rose which is
gonna be really fun
and we're gonna go to the Grove and
beautycon was like crazy yesterday it
was so fun and it was open meeting lunch
of you and I'm wearing this shirt that
Katie got for me if you're watching with
KP but so nice to meet you and this
shirt is like me it says the beach is my
happy place and it's so soft so I love
it yeah someone to go get coffee and I'm
getting a veggie bagel
it was so nice having an Airbnb just
coming here like every day and we
realized it was really good having an
interview me too
because other people that we know that
run hotels never wife hiding stuff so
yeah I'm gonna be sad to leave my veggie
bagel
you see I'm thinking of you here these
necklaces are so adorable I love those
little deep
yeah he's so good
so we just went to Melrose trading post
I'm so sorry I'm literally like dripping
because it's really odd out but it was
really fun I feel like like my voice is
going away sounds kind of hey Justin oh
well ha what we got there on Ann Marie's
channel so you can check it out we're
about to go to toast yeah it seems like
so good this looks so good I saw
something today he's elected to get it
and I got a floral burger you saw it
someone said yesterday they comment in
my video you should do what you eat in a
day like every day while you're in LA
which I pretty much have been anyway cuz
I've been showing like every food that I
eat since we always go out so yeah
at the coast was so good holy moly
Tasha there's so many people we just
might have subscriber I really wish I
put her in the blog because her name was
Gretchen like it's
not every day that you meet someone with
the name gretchen am i right so that was
really cool
she's really tall it's fine we love
meeting you guys it's so fun so this
place is just so queue
really they do and ones like those are
free people too I need to get something
from here just because I love
anthropology and I believe nothing from
here
PSA everyone if you need to use the
bathroom don't go to Barnes &amp;amp; Nobles
that's probably what everyone else is
thinking I waited in line for 20 minutes
I was this close to peeing my pants like
this oh yeah just so you know I've
written email that he'll see you soon
probably back in Boston now we need to
find pressed bears umami which I've
heard of I like this little area with
all the lights it must be so pretty at
nighttime look so cute I've definitely
heard of the Grove Mike seen videos at
the Grove and stuff too
yeah
Josh's dad they ran out of chocolate
look at this line it's like ridiculous
but I'm really excited I got normal
through one with almond butter and
coconut and raspberries I think the last
time I walked we were leaving the Grove
and Tasha was sad cuz they know I was
sad - oh I remember what I need to
address okay a lot of you my vlogs
you're being like what's wrong with
Tasha Tasha she was a precocious mean
Tasha's mad she's giving you dirty looks
like no and I don't well I'm not like a
super crazy like happy person all the
time like a mom I'm happy I'm not like
really hydrated I'm more like laid back
so when you Gretchen is logging I'm not
gonna be like I just my natural face is
kind of like resting but I guess I went
to my mother by the way is it like her
personality isn't transfer that well on
camera you know yeah I'm more like so
cast I mean I'm not like seriously
obviously I love mention I didn't hang
out with her if I didn't and I'm not
trying to roll my eyes honestly I was
probably like looking on
I don't know Gretchen if I'm making a
face and I'm like everyone's like yeah
she hates her like oh she doesn't hate
me I feel bad like I don't want like
okay let me just like relate this to
another situation you guys say this all
about my twin sister Lucy okay yeah
wouldn't be me do like Lucy doesn't hate
me okay yeah so honestly I'm not trying
to roll my eyes and I'm you know it's
like totally not on purpose
I feel like maybe just compared to me
like Lucy's type of personality and
Tasha just a formality they're just more
calm and I'm like blah blah blah so like
yeah she doesn't hate me please don't
comment that she hates me because she
doesn't okay okay forgive a photo shoot
oh you're spicy new romper
spicy we're now in the room of Lorenzo
I'm going to show my parents smoke
they're gonna be like
now we got Lewbert EES we're just
waiting for our food attention
Tasha is like 15 minutes over here or
something but it came lucky mine's like
almost here
she's like one minute right
this is me sighting should I put in my
coat in this video so they can get it oh
my gosh guys I'm gonna put my code right
here because I know overeats is like
noon whatever and it's what is it it
gives you $20 and free credit so yeah
free meal on me have fun so we got our
food oh wait what is the place what's it
called edible okay so we got these like
bowls and they look so good if you guys
know meme holes are my thing usually
acai but this will work - so basically
overeats it's just like post mate but
like uber and what's cool is Center try
and like get the word out and like start
it this isn't sponsored by them or
anything I feel like I like it starting
to sound like sponsored but you like get
a code and stuff you can use the code
and you'll get $20 off so it's like a
free meal and like I said I hope my
insert right here so that you can use it
we just got back to our Airbnb to get
all of our stuff to head off to the
airport and Tasha in exactly 12 and a
half hours we will be landing here goes
nothing get a good look at me now
because in 12 hours I'm gonna look even
more rough than I do right now which is
I know hard to believe oh my gosh it's
gonna be a really long trip for both
like dreading sitting on the plane that
long I know I'm just gonna be like
hopefully we can sleep I don't know I
just don't even really think I can sleep
me neither
I mean like utter and like I just bags
are heavy I'm already tired and peaceful
of 12 hours of traveling but we'll get
through it it feels crazy that we're
leaving already gone by so quick it's
been so so fun I feel lucky I have take
a little tour guide I know I really
would have been lost without you like

to remember Tasha struggling
mom and dad this is for you you can see
where we stayed it's really cute and
nice this is her front porch

patio that's the guest house over there
maybe these will be warm and help us

gonna come I'm gonna be the person Alec
loses all their luggage oh it's that
little blue one jam-packed it is so got
my suitcase but I thought my little
backpack nope too much thick nail polish
