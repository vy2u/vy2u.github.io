happy vlogmas day a 6 wow I can't
believe it's like the 6th day already
and you know what it's not even morning
because it is 3:16 I can't believe it I
slept until 1:30 today because I went to
bed super early just putting up
yesterday's vlog miss and yeah I needed
the rest
vlog missed a 5 that I actually put up
last night I had to take down for
personal reasons so be on the lookout I
may be able to repost it if I take out
some part so yeah just I'm sorry about
that I did put it up however I took it
down I'm really sorry and yeah I guess
you'll just have to see if it goes up
again it might not
good thing is there'll be 24 other days
of vlogmas that you can look forward to
and watch so that is that I literally
can't believe it's so late already but I
just got ready and I'm just going to go
meet Lucy and Taylor at Dunkin Donuts
because we decided why not I might just
get like a bagel or like hot chocolate
or something and today's question of the
day I just thought of it is going to be
on your bagels do you like butter or
cream cheese because I know there's like
two different types of people and one is
like totally like scream
better and I think the other just really
likes butter my friend Hanna out like
spotted on her bagels I just like cream
cheese better butters all right but like
cream cheese is better so leave your
comment down below do you like cream
cheese butter or butter I'm curious to
see if there's a majority of people that
like butter butter or cream cheese cream
cheese is better I think I'm just gonna
be doing some homework today and editing
more vlogmas because that's what I'm
always doing
it's getting closer to Christmas it's
such a pretty morning or afternoon I
guess hey what'd you get - I got hot
chocolate - pumpkin muffin and I got
everything bagel with cream cheese I
guess what my question of the day was
this morning

I'll find you one guess what my question
of the day was I said do you like cream
cheese on your bagels or butter and I
said I like cream cheese good you like
cream cheese

you're a butter or like peanut butter
type person just peanut butter oh I
didn't even leave that as an option

were sad she got me pretzels because I
was sad earlier I think that's why I
didn't vlog the bunch today cuz I kept
like crying so sorry sorry I didn't vlog
that much so at the floor meeting they
had Oreos and I was like I don't need
any but then I ate three of them and
then I decided that for Yas tasted
really good so then I just ate the rest
of the ones that we had in our room and
I've discovered that I really do enjoy
some good Oreos and now I'm probably
gonna eat some chocolate pretzels that
Lucy got me micaiah do you like
chocolate-covered pretzels uh-huh we
couldn't share them you wanted someone
