filming a dorm tour this has been so so
requested and I hope you enjoy so I
guess we'll start with the outside of
our door so as these two cameras that
were actually here we got here and Ryan
says CAS 19 and her says CGS 19 that's
mkhaya my roomie and she says we
actually took a little clip of her hears
her saying hi say hi yeah she actually
is the best thought everybody's loved
macaé
and those are two little cameras with
the colleges were in on the back of our
door we just have two little hooks that
came with the place and I have a white
towel there that I use when I shower and
she has a blue one there and I think she
has a little robe too in here's a mirror
yeah this mirror just came with the
place and I thought we'd have to buy one
so that's super nice that we didn't have
to cuz already came with fun sorry I
don't have any makeup on yet all right
here's just a little overview there's my
side and here's the kaya side so just a
little bit Micaiah she's from California
and we both got placed together because
she's wrong on the open white team here
and I'm running late a team and I go to
Boston University if you guys this is
like the first video you're seeing of
I've and it's really nice to like have
another row or two room with I'm super
happy we got put together and she's
literally the sweetest person ever like
it's awesome we have a great room so
I'll just show you my side first
starting right here is just my lanyard
that has my little ID card on it and my
key and I put like a little command hook
right there to hang it up and then down
there I actually shove those two like
white bangs with a little pulley out
drawers and I can't believe they fit in
there so seamlessly because it was
really a pain getting them in there like
guys like do you see like they barely
fit it's like perfect for storing like
plates and silverware and paper towels
and cleaning supplies and a bunch of
food if you can't tell like I literally
brought so many snacks and so much food
in case I'm like starving after that I
don't whole closes or whatever and then
here is my closet
quick little background it came with a
and curtain right here and I didn't want
to film this yet because I didn't get a
new curtain for it we both took off our
tank curtains she just got like a pretty
new white one with yellow flowers and I
didn't get one yet I have to get like a
new curtain for right here or if I don't
get one that I just don't have one but I
would like to get one I feel like it
looks kind of neat or you know to have
one right there anyhow I hung up like a
lot of shirts and like sweaters right
here and I had a really hard time
fitting them all I actually descend a
bunch of stuff back home I they're all
like squished in there they barely fit
because I tried to fit the shoe storage
thing okay I feel like this looks so
ridiculous do you see like this is like
coming up like it's supposed to be like
that but I have too many shoes in it so
it like pops up but it's just one of
those white like shoe box storage things
and it's supposed to go all the way down
but as you can see I have like drawers
there so I only get use out of like two
or three of them but it's okay because I
just shove all of my shoes in there I
had to send some shoes home too and then
the rest of my shoes like boots and
stuff are up there and I just have a bag
a really huge bag of veggies drawers
like chillin in front of all my shoes so
yeah that doesn't look pretty but that's
just where they fit okay and then this
shelf up here I was gonna like organize
and fold and make it look all cute and I
didn't I'm sorry it will get organized
at some time or another this is funny
because if you guys saw my room tour
that I just filmed at my house before I
came here my top shelf looks like that
with all my sweatshirts and sweatpants
and that's essentially what's happening
here except I have some scars thrown in
there too some belts some drivers cheats
in some bananas
lol that shelf is just a mess really and
then down here I have my tripod that
used for filming then I just got this
grey bin with a bunch of white print
recently at like Marshall's I think and
this thing was so handy because I put so
much junk in here that I don't have a
spot for so I have some swimsuits that I
use like for cross-training I'll swim
sometimes I just have a good black bag
with like my toothbrush in my toothpaste
like toiletries like that that I just
need like run to the bathroom in the
morning at night and whatever and I'm in
this little like mesh bag I have like
all these nail polishes that I draw it
was really hard to pick which ones I
wanted and then I have my beats well it
is the case there is my actual beats and
then there's a hair dryer and there's
some curling irons and straighteners at
the bottom of there so that's cool and
then it's like chord city I have like a
bunch of chargers and cords and plugs
whatever all right here.look extension
cords but I have two for like all the
electronic things that I have it's right
here I'll just show you is my whiteboard
and it's just my schedule for the month
of September I have a bunch of stuff on
there and I probably have to add more
like my classes and whatever I have a
very busy full schedule with rowing in
class and everything that appear I have
this sign that I got from Marshalls and
it's so cute as all these places in
Boston we're actually going to Copley
Square today so yeah back down here I
have this white lamp that I think I just
got it like Walmart and I'll just use it
I guess if I do homework sometimes but a
lot of times I don't even do homework in
here because it's actually so so hot in
here like especially I always had this
fan going but right now I turn it off to
like from this video and try to get in
pretty toasty so yeah I usually don't do
homework in here I'll go somewhere like
air-conditioned there's two plugs right
there so I like a laptop charger right
there and like my fan plugged in there
and then I just have some hair ties miss
little section and I have a book and
necklace and some pearl earrings and
then right here I got this little box
from Marshalls as well and it's just
white and it has with these kind of
distressed wood drawers and I literally
thought it was so cute when I was at
Marshall's like looking at it and I just
put like all my jewelry in there I think
it's such a cute little jewelry box and
I just have like a Tiffany box on the
top with my most used necklaces just
like dainty little silver ones that I'll
wear like all the time and then right
there I have my Boston University
Camelback then right here I just have my
fan which is like my Savior it's like so
strong and it like makes this room
bearable because like I said it's so hot
in here
and I have it pointing like right at my
bed so it gives me cool at night then
our here I just have a picture of me and
all my high school friends Lucy Taylor
Amelia Hannah I said class of 2015 since
we graduated from high school this year
by this blue little elephant candle like
I showed in my room tour Lucy got him
for me he's from Urban Outfitters I just
have this perfume tray I stole this from
my room and I brought a bunch of my
favorite perfumes and then down here I
just have like a white little organizer
thing I believe I got that from I'm good
I think it just has like some wallet it
has some pencils and pens there's like
some q-tips back there I think like
playing cards just a bunch miscellaneous
stuff right there stuff that I have like
from a video with soon I have my wallet
right there I like a little light-up
mirror right there that I used to do my
makeup I have a bunch of brushes Niraj
color right there
I have Cetaphil moisturizing my favorite
moisturizer I have a bunch of lipsticks
and lip stains alright
they don't ask me why I need to bring
all those in my head I thought I did I
really don't need all them a bunch like
my everyday makeup in that clear little
acrylic drawer
I like the nail polish I'm wearing right
now right there in case I need to make
any touch-ups and then I have this clear
cup that I got from contigo it's like my
favorite cup ever because you can take
out the straw and the little latch
closes you can just like throw the cup
into your bag and it won't spill or
anything so I really love that puff it's
so cool and it's like two layers so it
won't get like condensation on the
outside and it won't get on your hands
and make them all wet so that's the best
cup ever a little bit Oh Lucy sexting me
I'm right here is my back with care that
I've been using for school work and I
just have like a black little incase
thing underneath it that I will put it
in when I bring it to class this chair

like a padded comfy chair that came with
the beach arms and then here I have some
like miscellaneous stuff I've some

here I just have like some notebooks in

then we here's a step stool to actually
get all the way up on my bed because my
