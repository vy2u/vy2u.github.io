little bit funny and I don't even know
what I'm getting at with this to just
give you guys some advice or tips or I
don't know if your eyebrows were like
mine so back in my childhood when I was
a kid I never really had great eyebrows
you know when you're a kid though you
don't really pay attention that you
don't really get it gets fine you're a
kid you're like seven eight nine
whatever my eyebrows are always kind of
thin especially towards the ends like
right here guys and even now just the
top right here just like doesn't grow
but then when I started plucking them
like in high school and stuff my mom
always told me they were too thin and I
was like oh Heidi like zip it like it's
fine and it just was like that for a
while until this fall I feel like
suddenly but I guess it was gradually
the majority of my comments just till
one day it was like every single comment
on all my videos we're like what is
wrong with your eyebrows and I'm like I
didn't think anything was wrong with
them it was kind of sad for a while and
then I was like you know what maybe all
these people are right maybe I should
fix my freaking eyebrows so basically
this video is just me telling you guys
if I can fix my eyebrows you guys can do
after my last like makeup routine video
if you guys go back to that you will see
my eyebrows were like this far apart and
I that was the biggest issue that
everyone had that my eyebrows were so
far apart but I didn't realize that they
were too far apart like for my face but
now looking back at videos and pictures
I'm like what am i doing so I was like
okay Gretchen the only way to really fix
this is you have to just let your
eyebrows grow out so for a couple weeks
I just didn't touch them and they grew
out crazy unibrow you know what I mean
but what ended up happening is they grew
a lot closer together you can't see
because they're really drawn on right
now but they start like out here now
instead of like way out here in the
middle of my eyeballs and that's my next
tip like I just said they're drawn on I
never did anything to my eyebrows like
that I never did them on I never used
eyebrow pencil I never used a nostalgia
brow pomade you know and my friend
Hannah shoutout Hannah you the real OG
you're the one that actually made me
start this YouTube channel so literally
if it wasn't for Hannah Gretchen loves
movie wouldn't even be here not kidding
but anyway Hannah coming in clutch once
again it shows me a nostalgia brow
pomade and she's like Gretchen you need
to get in and I was like okay and I used
it back on my eyebrows were still way
too far apart but at least I started
drawing them on you could see that I had
ends in my eyebrows
and then ones I decided to let them get
closer together and like a little bit
thicker I kept using the Anasazi ax brow
pomade and everyone was like wow
catching your eyebrows are way better
and today and now what I've been using
recently is that on nostalgia brow Wiz
like pencil I actually like the pencil
better because I think I can get a
straighter line right here and I have
more control but people that are pros
can use like the pomade cuz you use like
a brush I think a lot of people like
that I just want to show you if my
eyebrows can turn out good like this
so can yours some of you still might not
like them I know for some people this
might be too thick or teacher onlooking
but whatever but I like them and I'm
finally happy with my eyebrows guys and
I mean not on on they don't nearly look
it's good they're still really sparse
but I mean there's nothing I can do
about that guy can't physically make
hair on my eyebrows grow you know what I
mean
so we work with what we've got and you
don't wait I'm gonna grab those two
products I was talking about so I can
show you them I know this isn't
sponsored by anastagia but like
literally I wish it was I was like if
you guys are watching hit me up normally
but this is the dipbrow pomade in soft
brown and this is what I used for so
long and I still use it sometimes it's
like literally the bombed ad but this is
the one I picked up recently Anastasia
brow Wiz is also in soft brown but it's
just a pencil and I like it too because
half of it is like the little Comey part
and then the other half is just a pencil
yay they are kind of dark like my hair
is very blonde but like I dye it like a
look at my roots you know what I'm
saying my eyebrow color is actually the
color of my natural eyebrow so I just
keep it that way I'd rather have brown
eyebrows and really blonde eyebrows you
can like see them you know yeah I guess
the point of this video is just if
you're feeling like you have no hope
with your brows step one let them grow
out step two you then shape them
minimally like only plug like right here
and maybe a little under here cuz mine
grow crazy underneath in step three draw
those babies on don't like draw them on
but like fill them in a little bit you
know so they look so they look nice in a
frame your face and I feel like they
just like changed up my whole look you
know they have like a personality like
eyebrows on fleek okay I am way too
hyper in this thumbs up this video for
my eyebrow game guys don't forget
eyebrows are sisters not twins like this
one like it is a little sassy I like
this one chose our own personality and
this one
like you know basically that is all for
this video I think you guys so much
watching I'll see my next one right I
start waiting before I said bye bye
