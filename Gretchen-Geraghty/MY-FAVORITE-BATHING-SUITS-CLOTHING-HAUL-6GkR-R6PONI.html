haul video that I've been meaning to
film for a while for you guys and it's
just a bunch of it swimsuits and some
clothes for example and don't forget to
subscribe so you can see when I post a
new video
I'll see should follow me on Instagram
because I literally from blog post on
Instagram it's just so fun follow me on
Twitter and we at snapchat yeah and you
guys know I go up softball for so long
I'm literally obsessed for bathing suits
it's definitely my favorite place to get
baby to true now I always eat versions
where my baby sits in it's doubtful is
the answer in the first meeting - I got
to show you guys it's just this voice of
green bathing suits I love the cut of it
just like the scoop detail in the front
I think is really flattering and then
here just the bonus to go with and then
my next favorite bathing suit is just
this velvet more it's like royal blue
velvet which is so pretty again it's
like a scoop neck in the front and I'm
just obsessed with this it looks a lot
like the triangle one got and if you
guys saw the triangle velvet ones that
came out I might want to get some of
those so I can like see the difference
between is you I could like take it to
me about that then here just about us to
do it and then I got this white bathing
suit from Savile which I haven't want to
top yet but I've learned the bottoms and
I just thought it was really cool
details ties on the straps and then type
in between I was just like this gritty
material and I love the bottom because
they're so cheeky so they're so good for
tearing extremely cheeky like a star on
the bottom so I love these for tanning
but just bet Michael Casey don't like
cheeky bottoms oh and just so you know
all this is gonna be like tell us you
should check it out also I wanted to
mention the sizing because all things
that I've always gone from before for
example I've always gotten smalls but
these are actually all gotten mediums
and some are kind of big most of them
fit pretty well and I think some people
notice that the smells were really
following me and a lot of their review
at the game easy to read small so I
would definitely recommend
sighs up and I don't mind baby just
being like really tight but I guess he's
probably to fit me better so a lot of my
babies I said I have in the past that I
still wear that I love this awful are
small and that's fine but I guess we now
and I'll just keep medium this just
because they're more comfortable and
then I got this white and black man see
what you guys probably recognize I
showed in a whole video before and it's
just play with this black detail I love
that it's straight across in the front
because it's really good for tanning and
then just the bottoms that you go with
and you might wonder a crunch and oh why
are you getting another baby to like
this well it's because the first one I
got was small but today's bottoms are on
it very very small so this all was
really just didn't really work for me
and I actually gave that baby to Mandy
so that I got it medium I was really
feeling out development trend because
I've been wanting that velvet I just got
this basic pink like triangle top that's
velvet and then the bottoms that are
matching to go with it and again this
one is very very cheeky it's like a song
in the back and I got the same style I'm
pretty sure just with the forest green
color like these green bottoms again
very cheeky and then this bathing to you
I don't really want to feel I've been
Tasha showed in her haul video and I was
like ooh like I want to try it out but
this one's very very big with the medium
bottoms kind of like fall off of me and
they're very high waisted and they sort
of look like a diaper a little so I
don't know if I can tell you where this
is leading to and I don't like having a
coyote's to tan lines but if you want to
like high-waisted bottoms
maybe just keep your nose out sizing
these because these are kind of bigger
than all the rest of the bottom but I
really like this job and I think I'll
wear it more as like a shirt top because
it's just like this
purpley velvet - top so I do like this
so I just got up clean a black like
basic bikini because I've been feeling
like
immediately just to go up like any tops
or bottoms that you have that are
colored I feel like a plain and black
basically she needs really an essential
I also like that this one is very skinny
on the side to you at like less tan
lines
sorry my voice sounds like weird right
now I always lose my voice and in the
last bikini I got is a little risque but
just bear with me
I think Tosh you got this one - did she
or maybe someone else I really am a
copycat said that once before whenever I
see other Michael wearing stuff that I
like I'm like oh I'm gonna get it - so I
just got this black top but it's like so
fun because it's mesh but then there's
like a black stripe to go over your boob
area so you don't see anything like
something this is so cool and I would
wear as a cabral that underneath we've
got a more sheer top or the Bears baby
suit - obviously the bottoms are kind of
wild
they're like a little bit crazy you can
see they have like extremely big cutout
details so a little provocative and the
last thing that I got is just this one
piece it's time to try it out just a
plain black basic Wimpy's and I really
like this one as well it should like
skinny straps and like scoops in the
back really low but someone is just
really classy and the last five things I
got are all tops so my favorite one is
probably this white top it's just like
off the shoulder so she I've gotten two
totally compliments on it I weren't when
I was in an tucky I could just like
laces up in the front and it's so
beautiful and it's like off-the-shoulder
I love it I probably should've got a
small this though because it's kind of
loose around it like falls down a little
bit just looks keep that in mind I guess
for sizing then my next favorite top is
this red one it's so beautiful again I
get so many compliments on these Tasha
on this - I literally copy everyone
or maybe just see Tasha I love you but
it's just red stretchy really cropped
off the shoulder top and I just love
these off the shoulder details and these
off the shoulder tops are my favorite
more so than the ones that just go like
this because I find that those ones
always come up but these ones obviously
stay in
please feel like type in the front so
you know these two were like similar
styles I got this gray one that's Croft
and under has a grip details and it's
like roughly around the sides I think
this one's it's kind of small on me but
I still love it and then this pink one
is kind of like that except for thick
off the shoulder and I just think these
are such cute little safety crops shirts
they're just perfect for summer and the
very last thing I got resolved all if
this crap teacher that says no broad
Club and just like I just love that this
is no bra club because that is so meaty
like I hate wearing bras ever ever since
I went to Miami in the spring
I really didn't pack a bra I know what
I'm I say anywhere abroad I was like
this is so freeing like I love like that
bras so sometimes also wear them but
watch I was I don't know I could just
picture me wearing this like nips out
and all thank you
wait a second you didn't show you guys
my favorite chair of everything I got
because hanging up in my closet because
I've been very into mice to look so
little holding it up but it's like super
stretchy and it's kind of like the pink
one and a great one that I showed you
with like the ruffles around the side
again this just sounds like the red
details and it's like really like
wrinkly looking around the sides I just
love this and this is like so kunis off
the shoulder but also long-sleeve and I
loved how cropped it is cuz I compared
it like when they are boots it's tough
so like this in specific posting
pictures in like when I was in in Tucket
I'm Instagram never ends and oh my gosh
where's your shirt from I've literally
turned like a nanny and all of her
friends I just awful like they're all
are ordering from there and getting all
the raises from there too so yeah which
is where it says they mentioned all that
we looked at below for your convenience
and then guys so much for watching and
I'll see ya next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
