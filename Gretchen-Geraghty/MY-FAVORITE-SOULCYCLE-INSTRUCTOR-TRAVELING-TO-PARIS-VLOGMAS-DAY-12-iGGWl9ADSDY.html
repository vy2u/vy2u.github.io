got it but I got the one in the very
front in the middle by kick so usually

the middle you kind of like leave the
class so kind of nervous
so I just finished soul seal it was such
a great class as usual James I'm so
sensitive one day when I feel like this

a half before I have to leave for the
airport and I got this big huge package
in the mail from AC Jessie and I'm so
excited to everything is I got so if you
don't know what it suggests he is
basically it's an app that has a bunch
of different clothes on there from a
bunch of different brands and then you
first download the app you just answer a
bunch of different questions so that
stylists can figure out what kind of
style you have a little just make an
assortment of designer clothes that it
thinks you'll like it was it Jesse can
be really good for people that like just
trying like new trends and styles but
like don't have time to go like shopping
like crazy so it's really helpful to
have a stylist like them for you or like
if you like a really busy mom and this
is the first thing I was just showing
they just it's really comfy I remember
picking this out just gave me like a
master vintage vibe over this jacket
this is such like a heavy duty thick
really great quality jacket and this
just looks so nice this is gonna keep me
so warm and I know they're also having
like a holiday Instagram promotion going

from say Jesse I have to do is post an
item that you want from suggest you on
your Instagram and make sure you tag so

like a suggestion I see and then suggest

send them a gift of their choice maybe

the spring with her friend break Lea so
I have their little keys I break these
key to I really hope I don't lose these
guys I literally tore apart my room
looking for these jeans you know these
jeans I got from equality I'm never
letting you out of my sight
different like black with rips of it oh
I actually text my friend Hannah last
night cuz I we got them together in
Burlington at this place called pink Oh
booty crack oh and I was like I love
them I'm so sad someone definitely stole
them whatever so I like tore apart my
room couldn't find anything and then I
have two other closets you guys know so
I literally ripped through them but I do
I like big you to bins at the bottom and
like shoes always fall around the side
but I was like there's no clothes down
there it was literally how did these how
did these get under the bed like how did
they I would have never put them there I
don't know and like jeans don't even go
in those closets are just for jackets
and dresses and they get changed maybe
yeah maybe like I do like I like if I
was wearing these I would have liked
taking them off on the ground tried on a
million dresses and woulda been a pile
of clothes and they could have gotten
like kicked under the shoes oh my gosh
I'm so happy
well my black Abercrombie jeans are
still missing but that's okay they don't
matter as much as these real Thank You
Gino silly right when I looked through
those closets to there's like a bunch of
blankets at the top of those closets and
I move them around
yesterday but I didn't like take him out
and show I took him out and like mine is
two missing dresses and missing sweater
we're all like folded into the blanket
so I'm like who puts these here people
are like hiding my clothes from me for
like a scavenger hunt
I don't know basically if you think you
lose things maybe they're not actually
lost these new eyelashes are like killer
I love them go to wink lash
they do such a good job by the way I got
the hummus tehina
I've gotten in so long I missed it
usually the same thing I thought it's
the same thing
like something like I just like I'm
scared that I'm gonna order something
and not like it and it's not gonna be as
good yeah so why change your ways I've
just tried every single salad from there
I think I don't think I missed one salad
I think I've tried all of them some
things I'd like modified like this has
it comes with feta cheese but I don't
like feta cheese so I just get it
without Oh Meghan tells me you carry my
bags this is exactly 50 pounds so wish
me luck it's good I'm gonna have to like
