you at my hair care routine from start
to finish just what I normally do and
I'm going to be using the rockier hair
hair products that I've been at trying
out recently and I really am a fan so I
actually used a GoPro to film this part
just because I thought it would be
really fun and I'm just taking my hair
out of the ponytail and I'm just showing
you the shampoo and conditioner I'm
going to be using and also I just want
to mention really quick as you can see
there's kind of some blurry parts on the
screen and that's actually from water
droplets on the GoPro camera itself so I
just get my hair all wet first of all
and then I'm just using some of this
shampoo and I like to put this first at
the top of my head and then kind of
spread it to the bottom part of my head
and I just scrub my hair so much as you
can see it's really just like really
soapy and kind of full of bubbles and
then I'm going to be using the
conditioner there you can see my loofah
I didn't have anywhere to put the GoPro
so it's like resting on top of my loofah
I don't like putting conditioner on the
top because then your hair will get like
greasy so I just put it on the bottom
because that's all that really needs
conditioner anyway there I notice my
loofah
and then I'll see you just saw me
washing my face
and now I'm rinsing out the conditioner
and I like to rinse out my hair a lot so
that is just everything I do in the
shower normally except of course washing
my body hey everyone so today I'm here
with Makai of my roommates I'm just
gonna be showing you how I curl her hair
and we're gonna be using the rockier
hair just like hair products and I
probably showed before this how I like
wash my hair with the shampoo and
conditioner I used to go pro is really
fun and then we're gonna be using the
get a lift volumizing spray for fine
hair cuz me and Makai both have like
thinner hair and then I'm gonna use the
leaving conditioner because my hair is
still wet right yeah so I guess I'll
just do that right now
here we go Amy Makai I've been trying
out the shampoo and conditioner Nell and
you like it right yeah it like smells
really good smells so good so oh yeah
smell this - smells good - mmm
weird that it smells super good so now
I'm just gonna curl her hair I'm using
the nume curling wand it's just like the
biggest one turn up the volume for hair
that rocks it all day volume reduce
frizz add shine can be using my dry
hairspray on wet hair for style and lift
okay you ready don't go like that and
like rub it in okay like absorbs quickly
good yeah all right i Rashmi thick hair
like Lucy probably to speed this up
now I'm just running my fingers through
it everyone cuz I like it when it looks
more like messy looking yeah look at her
hair like so now I'm gonna use more of
the volumizing spray
I don't like spraying in my hair I like
putting my hands to make them more loose
and soft and such now what I called you
here so quick maybe I should just comb
my hair to look here I'll zoom in more
oh no you can't even see that well
beauty oh don't look so good they're
just like loosen like okay we should
like younger hair
now I'm gonna crap my hey hey my hair's
still like sort of wet but try enough
right before that alright okay so this
will be start with I didn't do more
leave-in conditioner just because I
didn't have before and I think it'll be
kind of like a key protected
oh it smells so yummy why notice smells
like you know when you were little and
you would use that on like L'Oreal like
no tears leave-in conditioner spray and
your smells kind of like fresh like a
raining or something that's what this
smells like
I'll have all these products linked down
below so you guys can check them out if
you are interested and behind me said
that their shampoo and conditioner have
made our hair so soft I'm using the nume
wand as well and right now we're
following in Taylor's room because
because my room is always a mess hehe
I'm just gonna do this really loose and
big like so this is what I was doing
with my guys I just don't know if you
could like seize well uh
oh my camera's dying or guys you've seen
me comb my hair with a million times so
I'm just gonna finish it off camera and
I'll check back in when it done what I
can say hi
so this was just my hair care routine
because I've been using the rock ear
hair products the shampoo and
conditioner and then these today we try
to mount and we really like them they
smell super good and I just thought it
would be fun to show you how I did my
eyes here too because I think this will
work for curly hair and straight hair
naturally because I naturally have
pretty straight hair and McFly's hair is
naturally pretty curly so yeah we just
curled like both of our hair and I
really like the way it came out using
these and like I said I'll have them
