happy vlogmas day 14 whoa
I am ran a 10k this morning and even
though I went to like a really slow pace
I was like dying legally I went at such
a slow pace and at the end I hope that
my heart rate monitor it was like 175 I
was like Jesus I don't know why it was
just really I don't know my heart rate
was going up so high also do you agree
with me I feel like um when I run on a
treadmill I can make my pace okay and
let's make sure I'm saying this right my
pace is like slower but my heart is
higher like when I run outside I can run
like a 9-minute mile which is like
usually pretty easy for like a real long
time like an hour and a half my heart's
like 150 but if I'm on the treadmill and
I'm running a 9-minute mile my heart
rates like 175 and I'm like dying like I
don't know what it is I think like just
treadmills are harder or like when
you're running outside you have like
more metanor momentum or I don't know it
must be something yeah so it's like
maybe even the breeze to like slows your
heart rate
I don't know and like it's like really
hot with like all the treadmills and
like everyone working out so now it's
already freaking 11 22 and I had to
finish her Spanish I say to hand in
today hey I have to shower because I'm
awake E and um what else oh I'm not
gonna walk as much today I know right
now because I looked I put together all
my footage from yesterday and we did so
much like we have lunch with our friend
Aaron and we went to like Fanueil Hall
and I can't stop so literally I have 42
minutes it's like ridiculous I can't
believe I have 42 minutes so I feel like
it all that weight I don't even know if
I showed you guys oh yeah I did at the
end of the vlog yesterday these fluffy
pants I got from Target and they're
literally like so soft and nice
also everyone today's question of the
day is what is your favorite core
exercise cuz little Mia ball asked me
and mine is leg lifts just cuz they're
my favorite so what's your favorite
comment down below
mine's leg lifts I can do
million of them forever I love them
jumping jacks jumping jacks is in core
yeah I like setups are all right
bicycles I know we're really good those
give you like the six packs but yeah
they're hard
hello vlogmas so I brought my camera
with me when I just went out and about
but I didn't end up actually vlogging
because first I went to a review session
for chem and then yeah I struggled it
was really hard and then I went into
like a Spanish paper and then I turned
it in and that's like dark out I'm just
tired
bad oh so lazy Makana I was gonna walk
back and I was like no and I ran to get
on the tee and I think my legs are
hurting too because I ran that 10k this
morning so I was like and Josh I wanted
to go to the UM yeah the Boston Public
Library and I like told him I would go
but now I'm like so tired like I just
wanna I didn't talk nice to put it today
guys I didn't add it today's vlogmas and
put it up yet and then ready past four I
stink and it's gonna take me at least
like two hours to edit it like at the
very least
because it's all that I have like 42
minutes of footage of or whatever and
then I wasn't even start anymore for
Kenan but what's the other that goes and
then I'm gonna go too bad cuz I'm tired
so yeah I don't know if I'm gonna what
the Boston Public Library tonight if not
I might go tomorrow or something
just cuz I haven't gone yet I was like
tempted to get insomnia cookies because
my teachers office is like right next
door and I was like no I'm gonna be
healthy and not get that I was like
you're gonna be good today not he inside
yeah so yeah I just had instances of
really bad luck I must have done
something wrong I come to get a pudding
out of the fridge and I close the fridge
and my mirror Falls because sometimes I
put it there to do my makeup in front of
the window and it just broke like
there's broken stuff on the bottom and
then I try to move my little stool and
it literally just crumbles like I
literally just picked it up and it like
fell apart but then there was tape on it
so I was like this it looks as if it had
broken before and someone put a tape on
him and I guess Sasha actually broke it
earlier so was he just not gonna tell me
oh my god wow I need to like literally
go to bed or something so that I can't
break anything else I put on so much
eyeliner today really I think I have
like raccoon eyes I don't know why I
just kind of went for it and cuz I
usually put like liquid on the top or
not it's I mean look what it's like
cheating like what it's like a little
pen marker thing because I can't use
real liquid it's too hard but I used
pencil but usually pencils way too hard
and I was like I'm gonna try so how it
works
okay I'm gonna clean up my mess now so
everyone all I wanted was this pudding
cup and it caused so much destruction
you know what maybe maybe just maybe the
mirror fell like on purpose like it was
supposed to fall on break so that cuz I
I think the reason I moved the footstool
afterwards was because I thought like
screws or something went under it it's
maybe the mirror was supposed to break
so that I could see that the footstool
is broken
I would have stepped on it later and
maybe that could have resulted in more
destruction so maybe God was looking out
for me you know yeah
Lucy brought me my chicken Caesar PITA
oh I've never tried that one she got
everything but the Ben &amp;amp; Jerry's we even
never tried that one Wow
white chocolate chunks and almonds oh my
gosh wow it's really only one I haven't
tried guys I'm still editing vlogmas day
13 and it's 757 on the 14 so it still
hasn't gone up I feel really bad
and I'm only at 36 minutes so I guess
I've done like she doesn't love me she
does because oh I didn't even tell them
what happened
so Taylor and Lucy went to go get pitas
and they're like Gretchen do you want
anything because I like really don't
feel good I'm so tired and I need to
edit blog mess I like my head hurts so
bad they both said like do you want
anything from there and I was like no I
don't need anything I'm not hungry and
they came back and I'm like I'm really
hungry so Lucy just went out again even
though she already went and got me a
chicken sister PETA so thank you you're
the best
whoa I think I was just going today put
on lots of mascara and I also put on
weight to my dry liner like I referred
to earlier alright guys so as I
mentioned a million times I it's really
my fault but I filmed for like literally
43 minutes yesterday and now I've gone
in town to like 35 minutes um so I have
edited out like eight minutes but it's
still way too long to put on YouTube
like no one's gonna stay here for 36
minutes like I know some of you say like
oh I will but like I just want to put a
video that's that long on YouTube I'm
being very unproductive because I'm like
so exhausted since I slept for like four
hours and ran a 10k this morning and
yeah I'm like just not being productive
so I think I'm just gonna go to bed
because I just feel like crap
and I think I'm just gonna put up to
tomorrow
that's okay with you well I mean if
you're seeing this it's off after that
one anyway I mean they're both gonna go
tomorrow this one too so yeah
ooh also I'm gonna tell my middle name
now because that video got like a bunch
of likes the one I said this needs five
thousand likes I think it got five
thousand likes and a bunch of you
actually already knew it because I
forgot I said it and I'm a graduation
vlog my graduation my high school
graduation vlog a while ago what was it
on this one
oh it says it has four thousand
something whatever close enough both
most of you know it anyway so I'm just
gonna tell you my middle name is Inga
which is like I mean you've probably
never heard of that name before it's
kind of odd and different but yeah it's
just my mom's like great aunt's name I'm
pretty sure who she loved so much and so
it's Inga yay ing a and yeah yes I do
remember mentioning that my graduation
vlog but a bunch of your commenting like
isn't it Inga yes hates Inga so that's
that and I guess I'll just end up a blog
missed a 14 here today sorry it was like
boring but I know I wanted to vlog less
since I've logged so much yesterday and
I just feel like eggy I needed to sleep
and take care of my health I can't wait
till after vlogmas is over for me to
