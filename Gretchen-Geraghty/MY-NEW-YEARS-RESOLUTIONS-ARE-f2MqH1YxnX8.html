to be a sort of a different kind of
video as you can tell by the title it's
just going to be all my New Year's
resolutions today is January 3rd and
hopefully I can just get this video up
today for you guys basically I'm making
this video because look if I'm filming
this video it's gonna kind of hold me
more accountable so I can look back at
it and then you guys can hold me
accountable as well and also I want to
make this video so that I can inspire
you guys and help you guys out if you
don't really know what to make your new
year's resolutions if you want to make
ones similar to mine and also if you are
new to my channel definitely click the
subscribe button down below so you can
be notified when I post new videos
alright this is a weird request but can
you guys leave me comments down below of
your favorite books to read because
that's actually gonna play into one my
new resolutions but in the next like two
weeks while I'm still home on break I
want to read some book so definitely
leave me comment down below of your
favorite books to read and one
disclaimer before I get to my New Year's
resolutions is that resolutions and
goals are only wishes unless they are
measurable and attainable and like
specific I actually learned a lot about
that my organizational behavior classes
semester so that's like the one really
big takeaway I learned so for me I'm
just gonna give you guys the general
resolution goal but I have specific and
measurable like things about them that
I'm just not gonna mention cuz the city
will be way too long like for the first
one I'll tell you so my first year's
resolution is it to it drink more water
and water just fixes everything guys
water is so good for you it's good for
your health
flushes out all the toxins like it's so
good for you for example my new year's
resolution is to drink three of these
puppies a day so this is like 32 ounces
a hydro glass and three of these would
put me at 96 ounces so that's pretty
good and I think that would put me above
the recommended amount because I think
the recommended amount is like half your
body weight in ounces but if you can do
more than that that's great so it's
definitely more than half my body weight
in ounces you know my second year's
resolution is to sleep more and this is
something I really noticed this semester
just how much sleep really affects your
day-to-day life and how much sleep you
get it really just affects the quality
of your day so much so in days when I
don't eat like 2 or 3 hours of sleep I
literally be tiring and Dombey I'd be
like emotional and just like a wreck
there's gonna be some days where you
have to do that if you're coming for an
exam or whatever like me but most days
I'm gonna try to get my 8 to 9 hours or
even more because you just feel better
that way
or at least I do right Gretchen don't
talk too long about each of these get
through him I see guys 12 or 13 so my
third year's resolution is to swear or
less and I already don't swear that much
I'm not like some potty-mouth like no
but I just think that it's not really
necessary for me and also all these are
like my opinion like you guys don't have
to follow these at all like I asked my
friends for all the time like you can
swear this total you but for me I just
want to be a fine lady and I just don't
think that's really necessary
my fourth Year's resolution is to spend
less time on my phone and if any of you
know me that are watching this you'll be
like haha because like I don't think I'm
on my phone that much obviously but my
friends my family are always like oh my
god you're like glued to your phone so
oh yeah I wrote them all down my phone
too
you know maybe I should have written
them down on a piece of paper so I would
have spent less time on my phone but
basically I just want to spend much time
on my phone
and that kind of goes into my 15 years
resolution which is to try and live in
the moment and be more present because I
feel like me especially I literally
everything's I'm crazy what I told miss
I feel like I have this thing in my head
or any be like this I had this like
running list in my head of like things I
have to do things I can't forget things
that are due today things that I have to
post very tomorrow I look up we can
picture a video a homework assignment a
meeting if I have food that I want to
make for myself because I bought it I
don't know I think I'm always constantly
not like worried but kind of like
stressing out subconsciously like
thinking and putting out our G and time
into things that I'm just worrying about
instead of like being president so when
my goals is definitely to like chill out
be present yeah my sixth New Year's
resolution is to stay in a consistent
workout routine and I already work out a
bunch I definitely don't think I need to
work out more but just more consistently
I think helps me like being autumn or
like scheduled visas because sometimes I
work out it's exam sometimes I work out
at 8 p.m. so I just kind of want to be
more on a schedule and even if it's
different times every day just know I'm
like what time I'm gonna work out I
think well me so being consistent also
does that except like sometimes if I
don't work out in a little while I'll
work out for like two hours but then
sometimes I'll work out for like 45
minutes so I want to be more consistent
in that manner to my 7th and Year's
resolutions all about YouTube it's to
make content that I'm proud of and
improve the quality of my videos cuz I
think there's just a long ways to go for
me and I was a virgin like I don't want
other youtubers that much because when I
do it kind of stresses me out and I'm
like oh my gosh you're so good editing
oh my gosh their camera quality is so
good like I don't know anything about
cameras I don't know anything
I think so kind of unlike educate myself
and like finally get Final Cut Pro she
don't tell me what I still don't know if
I don't get pro but I need to get it
look I'm literally gonna get it in the
next week month because I need to
improve the quality of my videos and
that's going to work towards this new
year's resolution my eighth year's
resolution is to procrastinate less on
assignments that is all I'm the worst
procrastinator ever I'm sure lots of you
that can relate my new year's resolution
is to worry less and go with the flow
because things fall into place as they
should I think I spend a lot of time
this year as well stressing out over
things that weren't lit really in my
control like I would worry about
Hutchins what happens when you graduate
well at least I figure out my major this
year so that's good I switch my major
you guys know we're in the business
school now but I filled out always were
you like oh my gosh I need it like
expand my network and make more
connections and like how am I gonna get
a job after college and like oh my gosh
what's my career gonna be yeah like I
still don't know my career he's gonna be
like I don't know what I want it to be
things usually have a way of working
themselves out and I think especially
for me like I'm typically a person with
like really good luck so I don't know if
that's gonna come into play at all and
I'm very positive I have a very overly
optimistic outlook on the world I just
have to keep that thread going and
worries about careers and such because I
think it's gonna work out it'll be okay
and if you guys are like me if you're
worrying about career and everything
just like do the best that you can in
school take all the opportunities you
can and during chips and stuff oh my god
so that's another thing that I can't
even think about like internships that
stress me out in the idea of them but
talking over couch guys things away
working themselves out okay promise
so the 10th New Year's resolution is
going to be really hard for myself and
it's kind of like weird to talk about or
admit but I wrote down live this year
for yourself because I'm constantly
trying to make others happy and I think
I like thrive off of other people's
energy and I really can't deal when I
know that people don't like me it like
kills me inside and so a part of me like
devote so much energy and trying to just
be so nice to them to make them like me
and I'm still really trying to grasp
that like not everyone's gonna like me
and that's okay and you guys should try
to work towards that too if any of you
are like me because I think when you do
it's really freeing and be selfish
because when you're young and that's the
time to be selfish and just do things
for you and not worry about any
significant others yet or children or
anything like that my 11th New Year's
resolution is to eat slower because I'm
a pig and I literally like scar food
down I don't realize that I'm full so
I'll keep eating and then like 20
minutes later
oh my gosh like food baby you know what
I mean like Thanksgiving fall so it's
really not necessary and if I just eat
slow or that we'll just solve so many
problems and it's just polite like when
I'm with other people and families you
know like Gretchen just slow down my
12th a New Year's resolution is to read
more like I said earlier please comment
down below your favorite books because I
would love to know I literally don't
think I've read a book in a couple of
years like I don't read it so bad I've
heard that people that read consistently
are more intelligent
so always trying to be smarter so my
13th and last New Year's resolution is
to do things that push me outside of my
comfort zone and make me uncomfortable
because I feel like obviously home in
New York I'm very comfortable I'm happy
that I'm at a university that's outside
of New York that I'm in Boston at bu
because I think if I was here I would
just feel stagnant and like I can't
really like improve or move forward
because I'm in the same environment
really comfortable at home with my
family my dogs so just already being at
BU I think helps me be a lot more like
productive and like looking for new
things and change because I think that's
really the only way you can grow is by
being uncomfortable and I'm the dead
person that hates change and likes being
really comfortable and would love to
just like stay here forever but a part
of me knows that like I need to grow and
like experience new things and like I
said like be selfish I'm young like do
things that I want to do for me not for
anyone else you know so this year I'm
literally and I've heard this when you
go into college - this is advice that
people give I'm literally just gonna say
yes to everything well obviously not
everything like only what is appropriate
but I'm gonna try to like push my
comfort limits and I know I'm already
traveling to Africa I think this is the
first time I'm mentioning it in a video
and this is at the very end so where
those of you that are still watching you
get like a sneak a preview into this
part of my life this feels so weird
saying it but I believe I'm rushing in
the spring epi you so that's definitely
a mean experience and it's something
that's already made me like so nervous
like I just I hope I fit in and that
people like me whatever so I've already
planned out some things that are gonna
push my comfort limits but I even more
just want to expand and try new things
and have new experiences with different
people and make new friends and meet new
people so yeah so I think that is it for
all my New Year's resolutions I hope
this video was helpful for you guys
maybe inspired you and some of your new
year's resolutions and again like I said
don't bring it to make these more
specific and measurable
chainable like literally measurable like
crushing drink three of these everyday
you know what I mean cuz it's way easier
to follow that way instead of just being
like drink more water like what does
more mean to you you know what I mean so
yeah thank you guys it's so much for
watching this video and I'll see you my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
