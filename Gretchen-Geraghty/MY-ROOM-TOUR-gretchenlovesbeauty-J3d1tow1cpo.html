most requested video of all time which
is a room tour alright so first off this
is my door like right as you walk into
my room from the hallway
and on top of my door I just have this
sign from brandy melville that says
locals only and then I have a mirror on
the back of the door there's me I'm in
workout clothes I'm about to go to the
gym and then all along this wall is all
these shelves that I put in and I also
want to just point out if you guys
couldn't tell when you first walk in my
room it's like a weird shape like right
here is really kind of narrow and then
it opens up into my whole room here's
like an overview of the whole thing so
first I just have this one shelf and I
have my yearbook and some other like
books and papers and stuff and then I
have this picture of me and my Coxon at
crash V's me I love you then I actually
have a bunch of business cards I don't
know if you guys have ever seen these
they're actually for this YouTube
channel so lol I got them it's like a
really long time ago so I just have like
two boxes of my business cards and this
is my current phone it's just my iPhone
6 it's white and it has a pineapple case
on it and if you guys are wondering from
it's from fashion Nova usually they have
clothes but I guess they have some
accessories too and then right there I
actually have my old iPhone that's like
cracked it was like the 5s that was gold
and I cracked it and there's a screen
cover over it and it's basically a mess
I just have that I guess in case so I
break that one I'll have another one
then I just have a bunch of hat and I
ruin these or just I'll wear them around
these are all of them just so my most
worn ones right here this little box I
made when I was like really young I'm
pretty sure it's like different color
like papers I don't know it's just this
box and I have a bunch of like pencils
and pens and stuff in there and then I
have my diploma from graduating high
school and then I have like some
planners notebooks right here I just
have this Rolly like a square bin thing
that has like a fuzzy blue top and I
actually moved to this house right here
when I was going into the summer of
ninth grade so at my old house I had a
bed that had like three of these Rolly
things underneath and I just kept one of
them to put right here in my room
because I hold like a bunch of bags and
stuff in
and then I have this elephant which is
actually my mom's and she told me the
other day that she wanted me to look out
for it so I just put it right there I
love elephants you guys didn't know and
then I have the bag that I've just been
using recently it's just like a black
Longchamp bag and yeah I pretty much
just like take that everywhere and right
here I just have this black bin for like
important papers and I put receipts in
there and I hear of the sign that you
might even recognize from my dorm room
haul if you guys saw that and it just
says be happy I'm pretty sure I got it
at home goods and then right there I
have another sign that you might
recognize from my dorm room hall and I'm
Matt from home goods too and this sign
up here I love so much my friend
Christiana made it for me thank you so
much Christiana it says GLP and it has
all these pictures of me it says like
Boston University which is where I'm
leaving and actually two days for
college I know I'm waiting for two days
so I did film my room tour before I left
so that's just all those pictures and I
haven't decided yet if I'm going to
bring them to college or not right now
this is just where they are I might
bring two I might bring zero I might
bring honey ever I want
I'm not decided so then we move on to
this second shelf I just have some
wallets right there I have like a Prada
one down there a fossil one right there
coaching right there that's just like a
little here Bradley one I have another
fossil one right there and this is what
I'm using right now which is just Louie
Vuitton dressing got it for me thanks
Justin and then alright here are my
perfumes I just have some like
miscellaneous ones in the back that I
don't use as much actually that yellow
one from pink I really like that like
body splash it's also good and then I
have like Donna Karen New York be
delicious I have like bombshell teas
from Victoria's Secret I love that one
so much I get seriously smells so good I
have a bunch of little mini ones from
Sephora like there's one from clean
Versace yellow diamond Dino is in there
so just a bunch of those and then right
here just like my favorite perfumes I
have aqua Lena pink sugar back there

cupcakes and this purple one right here
is Dior Addict to life it seriously
smells so good it's like my favorite one
there's a little mini one right there
and then also dolce gabbana light blue
is right there and then it has a little
baby and also too I really like this
plaid looking one right here it's by
Burberry I think it's called Burberry
Brit that one
it smells so good my friend Taylor
showed it to me love you Taylor
and then that one right there I think
it's just like the original Juicy
Couture one and then right there is just
like a little mini Viva La Juicy that's
like one of my favorite perfumes to you
and these are just some roller balls I
have that white one right there was like
a different perfume but then I put coach
papi in there so that's that one that I
have on Victoria Secret bombshell then I
have a dolce gabbana light blue like
travel one because that was here said my
favorite perfume for a long time and
then I have Daisy by Marc Jacobs little
rollerball because that one smells
really good and then also right there I
have some sand from Cancun Mexico
because Ivana vacations are with my
family and we love it there I don't know
if I mentioned but these white shelves
that I have my dad actually put up for
me he like built them so I don't know
where he got that I think he literally
got like wood
he painted them white and then he put
them up with those white little metal
fixtures so then moving on along down my
shelf I have two pairs of ray-bans in
the black case I just had these brown
ones they were like a little bit bigger
than the normal aviators I think and
they were like gradient Brown and I
really like those they with a gold frame
and then in the brown case I just have
these black ones they're like all black
aviators and I really like those two
they look really sleek if you wear them
and then right here I just have a bunch
of other miscellaneous sunglasses these
first ones are like the club master
style ones they're from j.crew these and
I got from Urban Outfitters these mirror
ones I got from American Eagle these
ones I don't know what any of those 3
are from but they're just like other old
sunglasses and right there is my Oakley
case I actually have two pairs of
sunglasses like shoved in there here
I'll show you them I wear them for
growing mostly so those are the two
pairs of oakley's I have these I
actually have a different pair of lines
that are black and I switch out the
black lenses and the purple ones because
I just like the different looks of them
and I mostly wear these roaming
sometimes I wear them when I lifeguard
too because they're polarized so they
help me to be able to see when it's like
really sunny out and then these are just
white with like red and they're like
kind of mirrored looking orange ones and
those I believe are called like the half
jackets and then right here I know the
frame is called like the flak jacket to
point out and I get like the XL lenses
sorry if you're not like interested in
this I thought I would just kind of
explain all this one glasses you then
right here I just have two things that
gum because I really like them there was
just the Icebreaker
coupons and that's five I still haven't
opened it and then I here is this tiny
little silver elephant and Justins mama
actually got this for me it's so cute
it's supposed to be like a good luck
little charm and I know I'll probably
bring that to college of me I think it's
so cute and then right here is a salt
lamp that I got on vacation in Hilton
Head recently it's really cool I don't
turn on the bunch of it here I'll turn
it off you guys that's what it looks
like it's pretty cool it's kind of just
like a pinkish orange light and this is
just like a salt rock like if you look
it - it actually tastes like salt so
that's cool so there's those two shelves
that I showed you and I'll actually move
back this way a little bit
and show you it's on top of my dresser
this white big dresser is from Ikea and
it just holds a lot of my clothes right
there I just have two tiffany boxes
because I have a Tiffany bracelet that
Justin got me for Christmas I love it
and I have a Tiffany necklace that my
parents got me for Christmas so I just
have both those right there and then
right there is the box that my Michael
Kors watch came in that I got for
graduation and then right here is just a
white jewelry box and I have no idea
where you can get any one like this
because my dad and I actually painted
this one white and got these little kind
of just hanging pictures to have his
like handles and I just had like a bunch
of bracelets and necklaces and earrings
and rings and one on in there and then I
have some more rings right on top of
there in those little bags and right
there I hold my most worn bracelets I
have like my Michael Kors watch I have
like all my out so nonny's I have like a
million of those I'm right there I to
necklaces I believe they're both from a
Happiness boutique and I was gonna show
them like in a haul video soon so that's
why they're just sitting out right there
I have my head of the Charles there
which i think is so cute I got it my
first heathercharles I went to which was
in like 2011 or 2012 I believe and he
Tokyo I'll probably bring that to
college with me too since I will be
rowing at Boston University and then
right here's what my favorite things
ever is just this purple
big huge scrapbook that my rowan team
made for me because I joined sister Lucy
and I've been rowing for the past like
five years during high school and our
club team just made us these scrapbooks
to remember all the good times and I'll
definitely bring that to college with me
there's some really cute pictures in
there and it's very near and dear to my
heart and they know I love purple and it
like matches my hair and perfectly so
also again shadow Christiana she's the
best she orchestrated that whole thing
so like I said my big boy dresser
just for my kia and I'm really bad at
like organizing my clothes and stuff so
I'm gonna tell you what's in like each
drawer but I'm not gonna be able to open
it that much because it probably like
shoved in there right here I try to keep
all my bathing suits but they're really
like crammed in there as you can tell
right here I just have like bras so yeah
that's fun
and this one I have like a lot of sports
bras and undies and such and then this
one I just have a lot of socks oh yeah
then in this big middle one I have lots
of t-shirts and tank tops and it doesn't
even come on all the way because they're
so shoved in there come on okay and then
in this middle line I just have lots of
sweaters which again doesn't even open
because they're all crammed in there I
really needs like a code you might close
and then in this one down here I just
have all my jeans again stuck and then
in this last one I have even more
t-shirts so that is oh right there I
will show you what's on my very last
shelf up here and I can't even really
like reach up there it's kind of high up
so this elephant I actually named it
Brent I think Brent is so cute and very
festive with all his little sparkles and
designs on him and he is from home goods
and that royal blue little elephant is
from Urban Outfitters it's like a candle
hovering that to college with me I'm
they're really cute like decorations
right there I just have two phone cases
and there's like a spec one and the one
underneath it I think just has some
elephants and then right there I just
have a change jar which has some change
in it and I have some like seashells and
what's it called a starfish from Hilton
Head and then I have that little bird I
think my grandma gave it to me
and I know I already talked about it but
I have that GLB sign and I know and
bring that to college with me because I
love everything about it and then right
there I just have a bunch of coats and
sweaters and some scarves all like
shoved on to different hooks and then
this store is the door that leads to my
bathroom and on top of it is a
stretching sign that my friend Amelia
made me I love it I think it's so cute
and then my bathroom you know I'll
probably just do like a separate
bathroom tour but it just looks like
that yeah kinda messy okay we're gonna
close that now my bathroom
men are here I just had this big huge
white mirror it actually started off
brown I believe I got from home goods I
was just looking for a big white one for
a really long time and then me and my
dad painted the outside white and then
right here it was my two windows and I
have some purple curtains along the side
I should probably get like thicker ones
that kind of block out the light because
sometimes I get woken up really early
because I really shear it may like let
the light through but for now that's
just what I have and also I've been very
hesitant to film this room tour for
awhile because I've never like exactly
happy with the way my room looks like
IOI's I'm like changing things and like
putting new things in and taking old
things out so that's why I didn't film
it for such a long time but yeah this is
how it is now I guess you just kind of
have to jump into it and film it
sometime or another and I'm leaving for
college in two days so I really had to
tell me before I left so that was over
there and then there's the mirror I just
showed you and then right here is my bed
probably the most like exciting part I
just have this roughly duvet cover from
Urban Outfitters and if you saw my dorm
room haul you actually know that it is a
twin XL duvet cover but I just put it on
my full-size bed because I was like
trying it out and I liked it and it
doesn't look that bad but usually I just
have like a white duvet cover and it
fits my bed it's actually a full this
one I'm gonna bring it to college with
me but I just have it there now cuz I
was trying it out and I think it's
really cute but yeah usually this is
just all plain white and then I have
this purple Mexican blanket which is
actually from Mexico people always ask
me where I get it and I just got it I
look at a little street vendor in Mexico
it's just like a little purple throw
blanket and then the top of my bed I
have lots of pillows which a bunch will
be coming to college with me that's why
I got them cuz my college dorm room I
wanted like white and gray kind of
neutral to be my theme some might stay
here and then I just have actually two
Mac books because fat my MacBook Pro
with like a purple case for editing and
more YouTube stuff and then I just got a
MacBook Air for like college and doing
like school stuff because if you have a
youtube channel you know like videos
take up a lot of space and editing kinda
makes your computer slower so I just
have that for my MacBook Pro and then my
MacBook Air will be strictly for school
and I just kind of keep those on my bed
usually because I'm always like editing
videos or
finding two emails or doing whatnot on
my computer's so then right there is
Charlie right there is Pookie right
there is Ellie and right there's April I
know I'm 18 years old and I have lots of
stuff to animals I love them charlie is
just a gray pillow pet - that just ain't
got me
Justin's my boyfriend if you guys are
watching this video and you haven't seen
any of my other ones Pookie is right
there I've had him since I was really
little I love Pookie he's just like a
brown little bear and also fun fact
Pookie was Garfield's teddy bear in the
movie Garfield if you guys see that I
don't know and then right here is just a
navy blue really fluffy elephant named
Ellie that dressed and got me recently
and then right here is April my like
favorite stuffed animal ever
she was from build-a-bear and I made
hurt with Justin if you guys saw that
vlog and she has a pink onesie on so it
keeps her nice and toasty warm I think
she's so cute and she actually smells
like cotton candy so that's really fun
and then on my pillows that white and
gray one it's so soft it feels like a
sweater I got that from Target
this white fluffy one I showed in a haul
video recently with Tasha and Lucy I got
that from Pottery Barn and then this
silver sequin pillow actually just got
the case on Amazon it's like just a
silver sequin case and then I bought the
insert for it at Pottery Barn just like
that gray Chevron one over there I got
the pillow case like online and then the
pillow insert which is just like what
you put it inside the pillow cover is
from Pottery Barn as well and then this
pillow right here it says dorm suite
dorm so like obviously that's gonna come
to my dorm with me
but I just have it on my bed right now
and I got that from Francesca's so
that's oh my pillows and stuffed animals
and then one as well I just had this
strand of Christmas light source I've
had there like forever they kind of like
make my room look a little more lively
and they're fun and they have like the
black or green cord or it ever but the
ones I got for my dorm room have white
but on to the white cord I think look
better in my opinion but these ones are
just like the normal ones just like the
white lights and then I have these three
pictures along this wall which are from
Ikea and yeah I think they're really
cute they've been there for a while to
you and the next my bed I have this nice
side table which actually matches my
dresser right there and I don't know
like what style they're called but
they're both just from Ikea it's just
like a plain white little nightstand and
then I my nice
I have this book that says happiness is
it's literally so cute it just has a
bunch of pictures and says like reasons
to be happy I love it and I'll just like
flip through it sometimes and yeah helps
me stay positive a lot of you guys
comment out on my videos too they're
like how do you stay so positive and I
think overall I'm just like a pretty
happy person and this book will make you
happy too and this is from Urban
Outfitters if I didn't say that
and then this candle is from Al Thani
it's called the path of life and it
smells really good it's just the candle
I've been using most recently and
Justin's grandma Aaron's actually got
for me so it smells so good Thank You
Gigi and Papa and then right here I just
have this picture frame with a picture
of me interested visitors us in Florida
it was like last year spring break we
went to Florida then right here I have
this white fluffy roughly lamp it's kind
of like my duvet cover actually but that
is from Pottery Barn and I just had this
clear like acrylic base that has all
these little knobs so that's cool so
here's just a little overview of the
area and I have this big white fluffy
polar bear his name is Hans and he was
purchased from a gas station I believe
in like South Carolina
Lucy and I went on like a rowing trip
and a bunch of the guys not this big
white fluffy a polar bear I actually
think he's like the coca-cola there and
then at the end of the trip they gave
him to me so I love Hans and he just
kind of chills right there then right
here I have one of these white hanging
organizer things and I believe this is
from Ikea too but I know they have them
like a bunch of places and I just have
like belts and my lugging xìng like
here in here and so lots of leggings but
yeah I just have a bunch of clothes in
there wow we're nearing the end of my
room tour can you believe it okay so
moving this way I think this is the last
little spot I've to show you guys and
right here is just a picture of me when
I was little and Lucy my twin sister and
my dad I love this picture and then on
top of my closet right here I just had
this brand new mammal sign and this is
probably my favorite one I really like
it but one right there that says
locals-only is kind of funny and just to
know he says that he doesn't like it I
don't really like it either I don't know
what it means but it's just there I
don't know but I do like maybe my little
one and then when you open at my closet
sorry it's probably messy you know I'm
really
an organized person I try my best right
there I just have a bunch of shoes wow
that looks really bad I'm actually a
mask but I just have a bunch of shoes
like thrown down there all right here's
a little more organized I guess there's
just some like boots on this little shoe
shelf I guess like a shoe rack and then
right here is where I keep all my
dresses they're just all you know back
there I've some dresses and rompers and
whatnot and this one right here you guys
I've actually asked me like a million
times where is it from and it is from
forever 21
I believe it's out of stock I know you
guys have like listed links oh yeah that
dress is from forever 21 I try that my
favorite one at the moment and then I
just have these like little wicker
basket drawer things that kind of come
out and I just have like shorts in there
and I have some other random like
scarves and t-shirts and whatever in
there okay and then back there is like a
mess it's like all my shorts on this
shelf and yeah they're basically like
falling everywhere sorry and then right
here I have all my like tops and
sweaters and such and it kind of goes
down that way more and then down that
way more and I literally have so many I
really have to like clean through my
clothes they're all like shoved in there
and I have all black like felt hangers
because I really like the way that looks
it's just like really sleek and they
like hang on to your clothes so they
don't slip off and then the other day
Hannah was over here she's like Gretchen
can you get any more gray like I don't
know if you see a theme but there's lots
of gray in black and white
there's something blue it's like a blue
sweatshirt so I do have some color in
there but yeah that's just like all my
clothes and I have to start packing my
clothes for college in my shoes so this
will soon be like emptied out and then
up here on my top shelf I just have all
my sweatshirt and sweatpants and yeah
they don't really fit really well
they're all kind of like shoved up there
sorry this should look better I can't
believe I'm showing you this right now
this is really embarrassing uh hmm but
yeah that is my closet I know a lot of
people that do like room tours will pick
here's my like second walk-in closet
like no I don't have a walk-in closet so
I just have to shove all that in there
and in there but somehow I make it work
and now we are back to the beginning so
I guess we'll just do one last little
overview bathroom mirror window
