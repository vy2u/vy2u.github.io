typical summer morning routine video
it's just a pretty relaxed summer
morning routine to keep it pretty simple
no makeup and yeah this is just how most
of my summer mornings go making me to my
channel make sure you click the
subscribe button wherever it is you've
been watching my videos thanks for your
continued support and let's just get on
into it so over the summer in my life
guarding job actually doesn't start
until 11:00 a.m. which is so nice so I
usually just wake up naturally pretty
late l did 9:30 or 10:00 I'm not in any
sort of rush because my job luckily
starts early and then I will just go on
my phone you know check my social media
my Instagram is I Gretchen those bTW if
you don't follow me already you totally
should in my Twitter is at gob YT and I
just make my way to the bathroom I'm
gonna brush my teeth you know pretty
self-explanatory then I put up my hair
to get ready to wash my face for the day
if you guys have watched my videos for a
while you'll know that a lot of times I
would just wash my face at night and
just rinse it off in the morning but
I've been like washing you in the
morning just for how refreshed and clean
my skin will feel all day
now I'm going to be washing my face and
I'm just using the vanity planet spin
brush and guys this thing is seriously a
lifesaver right now I've talked about it
in my videos before because it's
seriously amazing so the first thing
everything just getting my face left and
I change up my cleansers a lot this is
just the Neutrogena one I just put some
of it on my skin brush and I just go for
it it seriously didn't think my skin is
so much better in past couple weeks I've
been using it more like religiously and
it's seriously an agent such a
difference as you can see it's like so
dirty after I visit and even though it's
in the morning and I think that makeup
on it just cleans your skin so well I
would definitely recommend it if you use
the code above your skin you get 70% off
I will have it linked down below then I
just use the set of Philip moisturizer
in this fresh clip on when you surround
that Sephora I don't even need to put on
makeup since I'm just live guarding the
day and I just put on some sunscreen
later as you can see my acne scarring on
my face has gotten a lot better if you
know how bad my skin has been in the
past and then I just grab a bathing -
also luckily at my job we're allowed to
wear bikinis which is so nice -
lifeguard in so I don't get a very pale
stomach and I'm just wearing one of my
new triangle ones if you guys want to
see an updated swimsuit collection in
the summer just give this video a thumbs
up so I know but of course I throw on
some clothes over top and I just use my
beer Bradley bag from like six seeds
I've been created when I use it for
school - lifeguarding because it's just
really practical you know and I just
have lumps of t-shirt arms and Nike
shorts and some flip-flops and I'll make
my way downstairs
and I pretty much make us move Eve over
breakfast like every single morning and
I just use what I have I just literally
throw in a random stuff today I did some
frozen mangoes and frozen peaches and
usually I praised bananas but I just
used a fresh banana because it didn't
freeze any and I didn't have enough room
when I first moved up the fruit so then
after I'm just adding in some dates
which are so good and so sweet and I
love them and I added some chia seeds I
think they bikinman them not really sure
and then I also when I'm done I would
put some chia seeds on top too because I
just like the way it tastes and I put a
bunch of different toppings on top so
like I said there are chia seeds I add
in some coconut flakes and then I add in
some bananas I added some cacao nibs and
then I add in some homemade granola that
we put some cocoa in so it's kind of
like a chocolate granola and if you guys
follow me on snapchat ready here you
know I'm literally post pictures of
smoothie bowls like every day on my
snapchat if you don't want me you should
my user name is Gretchen with 5s and
don't forget if you want to get the spin
March that I have you can use the code
love your skin for 70% off and then I
did for my sin on morning routine and
thank you so much for watching I'll see
you my next video
