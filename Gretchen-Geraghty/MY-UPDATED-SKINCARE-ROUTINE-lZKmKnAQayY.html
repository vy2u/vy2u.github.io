updated skincare routine for you guys
and it's a little bit different than
normal because I'm actually adding
something new which is super exciting so
I just thought I would share that with
you guys
at the end I can give you like my like
first impression of it cuz I'm gonna try
it out today and then also I can like
check back in with you guys maybe and
I'm like a month or two so you can see
how I've been liking it and I'm just
gonna show you some other things that
I've been using as well I guess I'm back
through real quick if you've seen my
skincare routine videos before you know
that I actually struggled with acne a
lot like all throughout high school
freshman year it just hit me really hard
and I tried a whole bunch of different
things so it's definitely changed a lot
but right now I think it's been settling
down that I'm in college but
occasionally I still get acne especially
I might updated everyday makeup routine
recently if I was really like catching
your breaking how are you really
stressed and I'm like yes I am thank you
for noticing so anyway that's I still do
breakout and yeah this is just kind of
like what I do to try to not to break
out but mainly I'm gonna be focusing on
why I'm adding to my skincare routine
and then I'll kind of just talk about
the other things while I'm showing you
this oh that makes sense
okay well I'm talking about is the
Neutrogena light therapy acne mask and
this is like super super exciting and
thank you so much contributing that for
sponsoring this video I'm so excited to
be working with you guys because this is
like seriously it's such an exciting
product and I remember when I first
heard about it I was like wow that's
like so great because I know like light
therapy has traditionally and only get
it at like a dermatologist for like
super expensive so this is like
obviously like at home I'm really really
excited to try it out I know you do it
like every day for like 30 days and then
you can buy like more activators let's
just open it up and let's see what is
inside guys Amy oh whoa okay pause
before I show you this because I just
opened it up that's kind of scary tbh
I'm just gonna show you guys these are
like three must-haves also from
Neutrogena that I've been sticking to
and that I like never stop using because
I really like them and this is the
Neutrogena rapid clear stubborn acne
cleanser and it's maximum strength which
I like because as we mentioned I've
struggled with acne and it's really good
stuff didn't you like this Anna when you
try - oh yeah
yeah it is like really good and I've
used for a while
definitely a fan so I will use this as
like an everyday cleanser or like maybe
not every day because it's like maximum
strength like if I'm feeling like my
skin it's really dirty or like oily or
if I want it to be really clean or but I
think I'm about to break out you know
you know and also like if you get one on
the pimple I feel like I can just feel
like I'm getting more and I know that
this light therapy acne mask is actually
supposed to help it like what is it
called exposes like all of your skin to
the light so when you get like one
pimple it means like more acne is on the
way so it's gonna prevent that candy
from coming to so that it's like super
great and also literally I just remember
because I like read a lot about this
before I'm showing it to you guys before
I try to help I just want to like
mention I remember something that's
really cool that I read all those even
says on the back blue light and red
light so there's like two different
frequencies of light that the masks like
the mitts on your skin and the blue
light is to help get rid of like acne
causing bacteria and the red light is to
reduce inflammation so that is really
sick and then the other two things I was
going to show you from Neutrogena that I
use pretty consistently in my routine as
well is this oil-free moisturizer this
is just for sensitive skin and this I
will use like in the morning before I do
my makeup because usually before I go to
bed I will use like a thicker
moisturizer but this one's like thin and
like oil-free so it's really good before
you do your makeup so doesn't make your
makeup look like oiler anything either
come in this as well and then this is
just the oil-free acne wash and this is
the pink grapefruit scrub and I feel
like everyone just loves this like I
don't know I feel like everyone uses
this because it just smells so good and
oh my gosh it smells like grapefruits
and it's just really really good at like
cleaning your face and get it like
everything off and like I feel like it
really cleans your pores because it's
like so exfoliating and really like
scrubby and you feel so clean after that
so I will use this once in a while when
I feel like I really want a good
exfoliator those are just like my three
like must-haves like day-to-day but like
I said I will be adding this is my daily
routine and it's funny because I
wouldn't think that you would use this
everyday but you only use it for like 10
minutes so you do use it like everyday
for like 30 days and then you can keep
going after that so it comes with one
activator it is like for 30 days and
like I said you can buy more and this I
got at Target so they are available at
Target and if I didn't even say it uses
targeted like LED light and not actually
will prevent the acne from coming on
your face and I think it helps get rid
of acne that is there as well and let's
just open this puppy up oh it's like
sunglasses this is so exciting that I
get to like try it out with you guys you
can see like my first impressions you
know and then like I said maybe in a
while I'll be like this like how my skin
so much and you can like to see butt
legs by tonight after I use it I'll be
able to tell you how I feel so I'm gonna
fill in like in a little bit as well I
know you can get it at Target I did get
this out to Target and I think I was
walking that day so I actually probably
have some footage I mean like picking it
up at Target so you can see and I
believe this is like the little
activator thingy is you like put on your
face it's like the sunglass thing and
I'm that is where the light comes out I
believe that would make sense pretty
intuitive so also I know the Neutrogena
light therapy acne mask is really easy
to use because you just plug in the
activator and it only lasts ten minutes
long so you can like to other things
while you have it on you can like
snapchat with your cool little mass you
can like watch TV do homework I don't
know I also know if you use the
Neutrogena light therapy acne mask
everyday it will give you it the best
result and it'll just make your skin
overall healthier and it will perfect
for the breakouts from coming and then
I'll talk to you guys after how I liked
it so I can give you some first
impressions also guys if I didn't say
I'll have the link to the Neutrogena
light therapy acne mask listed down
below it so you guys can check it out if
you are interested so now I'm just using
this face wash that I showed you guys
earlier the one from Neutrogena and okay
oh my gosh my face was so funny since I
went to yoga my makeup was just like
dripping all over my face so yeah I just
use this to eat my skin super clean
before using the light therapy acne mask
because I think I said before you should
have really clean skin when you are
using it that way it just works the best
so that just made my skin it really
clean and then I don't know why right
here I didn't talk through it I was just
like I'll do a voice over so I'm just
gonna keep on talking for a bit I just
threw up my hair in a bun
after I showered and I'm all super clean
right now and I'm just putting on the
light therapy acne mask I'm showing you
that at first there's like third Hewes
has left you know because I didn't use
it and then I just put it on and those
making faces through so funny because
you couldn't even like see it under the
mask like I don't know what I was
thinking and then you turn it on and
then it's like so bright it's like this
pretty pink light and then I was just
like texting and stuff and just
Hilla now I took some snapshots of a
really funny I was adapting my friends I
was like look at how funny I look oh
yeah and then I was just showing you
there's like 29 it uses left yeah yeah
yay oh well my little sunglasses back up
Oh Marco where there on my face that's
so funny
or I'm gonna sit down so I don't have to
scan you're in just like crouched
weirdly okay so I apologize for my
appearance as you guys saw I just got
all in ready I actually went to yoga
itself like way way later it's literally
11:40 p.m. here I'll take on the button
so maybe I'm not looking okay so I went
to yoga came back and as you guys saw I
wash my face with the face wash I showed
earlier the Neutrogena one and I got my
skin so clean so that's really important
I know before you use this little light
therapy mask you want to have really
clean skin so that did the job and then
I was timing to use this and I showed
you one here how there's a 29 uses left
since I used one so I guess first
impressions of this wow so the first
thing that really stood out to me is I
don't know if you could tell just by me
wearing it just by seeing it a little
bit it was very very bright just having
it on so it's really good that they have
this protective look I wear because all
I noticed like in something I was like
whoa like it so bright obviously that's
the point of it to get like the LED
like-liked therapy into your skin
another thing I noticed is that it went
by really quick I know it's like 10
minutes long any times before you like
it shut off on its own and then I was
like oh wow that was quickly done
already because I kind of just put on my
phone I was at texting i snapchatted
then I just listened to some music and
was like chilling out so I'm gonna keep
using this for the next month if it
shows like really good result it's like
that's amazing because it's so quick in
its at night and I just sit there with
it on my clean skin put it on for 10
minutes take it off done so at first I
was thinking like oh I don't know how
convenient like a light therapy mask
could be but honestly that was so
convenient because I could just see
myself throwing it on at night for 10
minutes when I'm chilling out before I
go to bed and maybe reading through some
last many emails finishing up some
homework
checking the snapchat Twitter Instagram
10 minutes is up take it off go to bed
Cygnet really awesome again I apologize
for my appearance right now like I have
no makeup on I'm literally about to go
to bed I like first impressions so this
is really cool I know I'll definitely
keep using it for the next 29 days and
see how I like it I'll probably continue
with it if it shows a really good
results which like I said earlier I know
I was like reading about it and pretty
much everyone that has
as seen really good results so I'm
really excited to incorporate it into my
everyday skincare routine and yeah I
know I said this earlier but if you guys
are interested in the Neutrogena light
therapy mask father linked up below the
yeah I think that is everything I tell
you guys about for my updated skincare
routine thank you so much for watching
I'll see you my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
