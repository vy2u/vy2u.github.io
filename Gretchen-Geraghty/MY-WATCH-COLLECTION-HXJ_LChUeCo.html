showing you my watch collection and I
wasn't sure about doing this video
because I feel gay don't know that many
watches I have like one two three four
five six I mean I eight watches so I
don't know if that's like a law it's
like it's not like more than normal I
don't know I don't know but I like
wearing watches I think they add a lot
to an outfit and a lot of times I really
forget to put it on but I like love
adding them to my outfits I think it
just purses him up I just took off the
one I was wearing today this one because
I'm going to show it to you in my
collection so I have them all laid out
right here and I'm just going to be
going through all of them and showing
you what they look like and where
they're from oh and I'm filming this
video I forgot to say because after I
mentioned in my room tour that I was
thinking out filming it you guys really
can't please do a watch collection so
here's my watch collection I've never
seen a video like this on youtube I feel
like it's kind of different and new so
hopefully you'll like it and if you
clicked on it I'm guessing you want to
see so let's just get on it to it so
here's just an overview of what all of
my watches look like so as you can tell
they're mostly like normal ones that I
would wear like on a day-to-day basics
except for this one it's like a workout
one two the first four I'm going to be
talking about or actually from this
brand called Yoda I'm so excited to be
working with them on this video thank
you so much for sponsoring this video
and basically they're just all these
wooden watches so thank you so much yodh
watches for sponsoring this video and
guys seriously they're so cool like just
the other day I think I was wearing this
one it's just like the small brown one
and you guys no Mekhi my roommate from
last year I was wearing this one and she
was like whoa like what is that like is
that wooden and yeah it is all of their
watches are made from 100% natural wood
so it just looks so cool on your arm
like look I just feel like it's so
different than like a normal watch and
its really like eye catching and people
just notice that they're like whoa is
that like a wooden watch and they just
look so pretty and they act like a lot
to your outfit so I actually four of
them I have this small dark brown on
just the large dark brown one to the
large like medium brown ones and all the
links to all of these and like the
actual names of them listen on below so
you can check them out and then just the
small medium brown one too so also
what's really cool is I didn't know what
size I wasn't watch like I don't know
how big my wrist was at all but there's
actually custom sizing on Yoda's website
so like below each watch on it's like
products page there's a little tab
called custom sizing so you can get the
right size of watch progress also state
to the end of this video because there's
actually a giveaway of 180 dollars in
store credit so stay tuned for the end
of this video - you're all about that
also I believe their prices range from
like $129 like $395 so they're
definitely more affordable than like
some other really really expensive
watches that I can think of like really
designer ones but they are still like
high-end because they're like really
nice quality so I think you definitely
get what you pay for and I think that
being said they would definitely be good
like a gift coming up for like the
holidays like Thanksgiving Christmas
whatever you share presents with friends
and family and hopefully win the
giveaway but if you don't you can
actually get $25 off your yo to watch
with the code right here it's 8 4 4 &amp;amp; 9
5 so yeah these are just the 4 I have
from a code and now we will move on to
the other watches so these are the other
4 I have I have two from Daniel
Wellington and then one from Michael
Kors and one from polar which is just my
athletic one that I wear when I workout
so I'll just show you this one because
this is the one I was actually wearing
today but I just took it off for the
sake of this video sorry my nail polish
is chipped don't look at it but it's
just a silver Michael Kors watch and I
love this one because I feel like it
just goes with so much I'm definitely a
silver type of person I like silver
jewelry like better than gold so I feel
like I just always like throw this on
with any outfit and it just looks good
you know so this is what I wore today
and it has some like diamonds for those
real diamonds I don't know I don't think
so no I don't think so
just like on the side and I believe I
got this for graduation did I get this
graduation I think when I graduated high
school so yeah I really like the fun
think some dads love you alright then
these two I have from Daniel Wellington
this is just a dark brown leather one
and I really like this one too I think
it's so cute and it looks good with so
many things because it's just all dark
brown and as the silver details because
I know on their website you can get like
different metals like different colors
and metals but I again like silver like
I have like silver jewelry and
everything so I like the silver details
and then this one's just a light brown
one it's like the same size and
everything and again it has silver
details but it has blue hands out of if
you can tell there you can tell better
it's like medium blue um just hands and
I think it looks so cool
so I really like that little detail um
it's a little bit different and then the
last watch I have to show you guys is
just this polar watch and I get so many
questions on this whenever I post
stories with their or just pictures or
anything people are always like what
heart monitor watch you use so this is
the polar watch this is the ft7 and it's
just this
purple like dark blue one I don't even
know if they still sell this because I
got it like a while ago um yeah this is
just what I use when I work out like
I'll show you - it's just right here
this is just like the heart a strap that
you put on right there and um mine is
really temperamental because I think
it's like old so I always have to get it
really wet before I put it on or else it
won't even read your heart rate because
it supposed to be wet - and ease it so
that it can like leave your heartbeat
you know what I'm saying that's just
really helpful when you're trying to
work out a certain like heart rate zone
you know and I don't even know what I'm
doing right now I'm like bouncing all
over the place but um yeah anyway I just
feel like that and I really like all the
watches I showed you and like I said I'm
having a giveaway with Yoda watches or
180 dollars in store credits - Yoda
watches website and I'll have it linked
down below so definitely go check that
out if you want to win some store credit
for some cool watches so yeah I think
that is it for my watch collection I
hope you guys enjoyed if you like this
