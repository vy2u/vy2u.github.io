I have been very sick these past few
days so that's why my voice sounds like
ridiculous and today I woke up and it's
actually way better than it has been and
it's like 5:30 a.m. right now because I
don't have to go to school to like
believe her around 7:00 I had to get up
really early because I didn't finish
doing their homework last night I've
gained this habit this year where I
don't finish my homework at night before
and I just get up really early the next
morning and do it all in the morning
it's really stressful because if you
don't finish in time then you go to
school and you haven't finished your
homework I'm just gonna get ready now
and I kinda wanted to give myself time
to get ready and like eat breakfast and
my family says it's my birthday and I'm
gonna straighten my hair and I know my
hair looks really ridiculous it's like
so wavy right now but I partially
because I don't know if you can tell but
I got my roots done last night just
because they're getting pretty bad and I
feel like when I get my hair done it
kind of dries it out you know since it's
like getting highlights so that's why
it's like extra curlier than normal but
my hair isn't naturally straight it's
kind of naturally a little bit wavy so
I'm gonna get straightening and I've
tried a bunch of different straighteners
but I'm probably gonna say that the
cheers is always my favorite okay so
yesterday when I went to my hairdressers
she started putting in like this leaving
conditioner she was spraying in my hair
and it smelled so good it smelled like
yummy sweet coconut I was like what is
that I have to have it so naturally I
went just for last night even bought it
it's like Bumble and Bumble hairdressers
and invisible oil heat protective primer
blah blah blah and I love it seriously
smells so good like I literally would
recommend it even though I'm used it
like once but I sprayed it in my house
tonight and it feels pretty good it's
like a leave-in conditioner and it
protects against heat so can't get much
better than that and I guess I'll stop
lying now cuz
no I'm gonna have like a lot of footage
today I'm super excited and yeah but
there's gonna be some surprises later
ain't a wink wink but I'm gonna show you
my hair now okay
happy birthday Lucy I've been up for the
past hour getting ready okay all right
so I finished doing my makeup and I
straightened my hair oh yeah
and it's actually feeling so so dry
since I got it highlighted so use this
oil that I've been teasing why it's a
new me argan oil and it literally smells
so good
and it makes my hair feel not so dry and
guys I wanted to show you something
really sad so my studio fix powder for
Mac let's just look at this really quick
great hopefully I get a new one for my
birthday I'm in NC 30 and it dropped on
the gardening out cracked and look
there's just little pebbles left so I've
been just like swirling my brush around
me to try to get it to like use it all
but yeah it's about that so I'm gonna go
put on some clothes and eat breakfast
Oh birthday surprise your stop what
we'll learn one of my subscribers think
about this I hope don't become there's a
recently big long time it's about how
that people are gonna like it
okay guys really let's just put a little
disclaimer every I sound like a smoker
yeah okay
they and me or sick at the same time
look at that new tender okay so even
though we're both really sick um
okay so basically bottom line is we just
got a belly button theorist
and I'm really excited because I'm not
kidding I've literally want my belly
button here since I was probably eight
or nine years old like ever since I saw
okay so we wanted our belly button
pierced forever and my parents were kind
of really keen on the idea and today is
my 18th birthday so I could like legally
do it by myself but I did tell my
parents and they're kind of like so-so
about it but did you know they do know
that it's happening so I hope none of
you like any mean comments or anything
because this is just something I wanted
to for a while like for myself because I
personally just think they're pretty I'm
not doing it because I want other people
to think anything of it I just want it
for myself and I know one of my friends
was telling me that this might be a bad
thing to do as a good role model for
like young girls but I want you to know
that if you're a younger and you're
watching my videos like this doesn't
mean like go get your volunteers like by
all means do not get your valley by
peers and if you think they're pretty to
either ask your parents and strongly
think about it or like wait till you're
18 but like definitely - I'm putting so
much time into it and like research like
we had to figure out where we wanted to
go like we figured out like how long it
would take to you like everything you
have to do for it so you're really not
careful about it and everything but yeah
this is just something that we decided
we wanted to do and I'm really excited
that I did so 18th birthday surprise
this is what I was referring to earlier
I was like surprised to come later yeah
so well we did it I put in that picture
of you here you done here's a picture
and I get it done right here
but yeah anyways now receive yes cuz I
gotta get some solution and I didn't
even hurt that bad
we decided because they like clamp um
here belly button so when they actually
put the needle through it doesn't even
hurt that bad like we were just saying
that the part that hurts the most is
when they're actually like sliding in
the needle was there but then I they
have to put the ring so that hurts but
then once again like I really don't even
feel it right now and we don't feel it
so it sounds good to get it but then
like no it gets like an ear piercing
like you can just take it out and ever
so that's why I'm not worried like if I
look if I don't want it in there I can
take it out so it's like not a big deal
but yeah there it is super happy now
we're off to crew are their birthday I
haven't gone to crew for these past two
days because I felt awful but I'm still
feeling obviously kind of sick ish but
I'm just gonna try to go maybe I'll like
bye can do Korn stuff I try to do as
best I can but yeah
poor little Lulu's been having headaches
how'd you feel good that's what I like
to hear
why don't you think everything's gonna
be okay alright I just finished getting
ready for my birthday dinner
woo and it's this top from Urban
Outfitters it has these like lacy
sleeves and it's a kiss year like blouse
right there
my necklace from j.crew I just thought
I'd show you because like why not
because they're the only pants I wear
like okay this wants to be filmed let's
go party she was I put on pants because
usually she doesn't wear pants so she
gets mad when I film she's like I am
okay we have to Danny can touch up okay
guys story time so you just went to
school a little bit cuz you know that's
what kids do these days and then I went
to get to my belly button pierced it's
going good
then I went to practice it really wasn't
a good idea I like went on the bike for
like the shortest amount of time I think
I only went like 25 30 minutes and I was
like dying like I just made me feel way
worse so I don't know if practicing
right now such a good idea in my state
of being but storytime
so everyone like in my town in school
and area is like sick right now if you
guys are sick to heal me everyone's just
getting sick and so I think I got my mom
sick because my mom started to get
really sick last night and this morning
we were having our birthday breakfast
she was sitting there like shivering
like poor thing like I know what you're
going through so basically my mom's sick
and you're also scratched birthday
dinner tonight with like Justin and Dani
to bring the boyfriends along but since
my mom's really sick my dadís like stay
home and take care of her so Lucy and me
and Justin and Dani I'm just gonna go
out to dinner instead so it's just gonna
be the four youngins night out on the
town so we won't be with our pain
so that's just the deal with that that's
like why that will be ass for later and
other brands do can we try to get them
in some vlog Lulu let's do it let's
secretly do it they'll go like this cuz
they probably don't want to be in it but
no worries but since your dedication is
going on right now because I'm going to
film the voice-over for my prom video
that is already up if you are watching
this so that means my prom dress is
still on eBay and you should probably go
check it out and buy it because then
it'll be so cool that you could wear the
dress that I wore last year because it's
literally the prettiest dress ever and
if it was me I wish I could wear it
again cuz I literally love it um but I
can't I knew would just sit in my closet
and I knew one of you would love to have
it and I paid a lot of money for it so
hopefully one of you can get good use
out of it so yeah go bid on that it's
linked down below
so basically oh saying I need to film a
voiceover for that video and it's been
ready to go up for like two days but
I've just been putting it off because I
sound like this but it's just gonna go
up anyway and I'm probably have to
apologize at the beginning like sorry
I'm really sick that's why it sound like
this but it's gotta be done I gotta do
it I will get some unbirthday footage
later and yeah I'm gonna fill my voice
over now whoa I don't way to get just in
and there's
right there you can't see them all right
I waited too even though it's like past
seven o'clock adenylate so dark you
can't see anything my voice gets worse
as the night goes on I'm sorry they're
laughing and saying that I sound like
making us cuz I was talking in a really
high voice so my voice but I hurry I
wouldn't like that it's gonna be really
funny to look back on and my voice is
like normal again and I'm like what were
you doing Gretchen anyways we're on our
way home now I'm actually blogging with
Lucy's phone there's some people I'm not
working with mine because it died so
Dani and Justin Lucy and I went to Polly
knees and if you're wondering our vans
at home but like I said earlier because
my mom's taking my dad I'd take care of
her I got her sick it's just a rough
birthday for us but 18 nonetheless I'm
very excited so meant to Bellinis and I
just made this decision on a whim I'm
right there you guys have probably
noticed some of you I know definitely
have I have actually had a personal
Instagram for as long as I've had my
youtube one I'll just tell you right now
because I revealed it to all of you

follow it and I did want to keep it
separate for a while look I just wanted
my personal one to be with like me like
my friends at my hometown and my youtube
ones if he was like all my youtube like
subscribers people but I decided you
know what YouTube really is my life so
we're just gonna combine them and like

one go ahead like you're my friends too
so I told you guys like go ahead and
follow my Instagram so you also can

has a girl last name on there if you
want to follow my personal Instagram
it's at Gretchen with five ends at the
end
just lots of things because I don't know
why I did that when I did that like
forever ago
and Lucy's is at Lucy Garrity which is
our last name can't believe I'm actually
saying her last name any video cuz yeah
really cats out of the bag because I
feel like it's a very like secret thing
on YouTube like no one will say the last
name so my last name is Garrity it
smells really funny I'll list it right
here
Lucy's at Lucy Garrity with two eyes
because really that's crazy go follow
her crutch you in with five ends and
Justins is at justin rm5 if you want to
