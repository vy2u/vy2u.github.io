pickles are gone
hey everyone so today I am filming my
swimsuit collection I'm just warning you
right now I have a lot of swimsuits and
I don't mean that in a bragnae or mean
way at all it's just that I have to
insist for Lucy for those you don't know
I'm pretty sure all of you know but
moving on we are obsessed with bathing
suits we grab maidens it's all the time
constantly and also since which means we
share all of ours so that's why it might
seem like a lot but also keep in mind
that they're split between two people
kind of and another thing to note is
that we are lifeguards so we are in our
bathing suits all the time and luckily
for us our employers let us wear bikinis
when we lifeguards so that's like really
awesome and I know a lot of places don't
do that so that's why I like mostly the
he needs we wear to work so they also
serve a purpose it's not just for fun
well let's just get right into it the
first bathing suit I will show you is
pretty basic it's just a black triangle
top from PacSun I usually just wear
Bandos you'll see that most of my
bathing suits are Bandos you know like
don't have straps it's just basic
everyone needs one and then I got some
black bottoms from PacSun to go with it
and I will also know that these are
pretty cheeky the guys several black
bottoms but these are one of the more
cheeky ones so just so you know I'll
just get started on the maintance is
from Victoria's Secret and most of my
bathing suits are from Victoria's Secret
just because I like them the most
they've really pretty ones Dave lots of
selection and they also fit me the best
so the first one I'll show you is just
plain black it's this plain black top
it doesn't even twist it's just a
bandeau top but it doesn't have like
underwire like most of mine do and it
just kind of cinches in the middle right
there and then I have plain black
bottoms from Victoria's Secret as well
and these are the kind that I'm pretty
sure they're called like rouged
bottoms like they're like ruched on the
side I have some of these and I also
have some ones that tie they're called
like double string tie ones but these
are the ruched ones for reference I'll
tell you sizes like ones that are like
small medium large I'm an extra small or
small this one just happens to be a
small I know some other ones are extra
small and then for bottoms I always get
an extra small because yeah I just
I like them tight because who wants your
baton to falling off these are my newest
addition oh look they still have their
tag on them these are also from
Victoria's Secret and they're another
pair of plain black bottom but they're
cool because they're all like roughly
and they also are like ruched in the
butt right there I love love love these
types of bottoms I have some other ones
and that's why I just had to go get
these because I really like the way they
fit basically most my bathing suits are
all the same exact kind just a jillion
different colors because I'm crazy and I
decided that I like love them guys
you're gonna get really mad and these
are basically like the same bathing
suits I don't even know why I have both
they're so similar I can't even tell the
difference but yep I yeah okay in my
defense they really are two different
colors this is called teal and this is
called seafoam great blue green so they
actually are slightly different but
they're so similar that really I can't
even tell but so this is just this
seafoam blue top I really really like
this minty blue color I think it's so
pretty and it looks really good when
you're tan all these sizes are like bra
sizes and in every single one
it's a 32b and I really like I don't
have any boobs sorry is that we usually
talk about I like don't have boobs but
32b is just the size that we Tory secret
has that fits me so yeah I just always
get 32b and then these are the double
string um
seafoam blue bottoms that go with it and
then like I said this is the teal top
which is also in a 32b or you know what
this one's in a 34a I remember okay I am
32 B and 34 our like sister sizes that's
what I've heard at least so they like
fit look the same but they just have two
different names so this one I remember
is the 34 tie because they didn't have a
32 B so I think one or two of these is
actually 34 a but most of them are 32 B
that's like a little trick you got if
you guys didn't know about if they don't
have your size and your 32 B you can get
a 34 a or if you're 34 you can really
get a 32 B because they fit the same so
that's awesome and then these are just
the double string bottoms that go with
the teal one I have this dark purple one
which i think is so so cute and it's
just the same style top pretty dark
purple and then I have the matching dark
purple bottoms - do we
then this is one of my favorite ones and
it's newer so you also may be able to
get it I'm a really pretty baby pink top
and I wanted a like light pink bathing
suit for so long finally I saw that they
had this color so it's so happy and I
absolutely love this oh my gosh this has
to be one of my favorites because I just
love like pink and I think it looks so
good when you're like really tan and I
have the rouged light pink bottoms these
are an extra small as well and look
there pretty snug but like who wants to
go loose falling off bathing suit like
it's good that there's none you know I
also want to note these aren't the most
conservative ones like they're a little
cheeky like you might see your butt
especially if you do get an extra small
so yeah just keep in mind have this
really pretty one from a Tory Secret I
think this print is so pretty it's just
pretty like designs I just think it's so
cute I have the top and then I also have
the pretty Paisley well that's what it's
called Paisley Paisley print bottoms in
there Rouge so cute and the next one I
have is this royal blue one which i
think is so free oh and also some of
them have cool colors on the inside like
the inside of this is like mint green
and then I also have the royal blue
matching bottoms and I just think royal
blue looks so and then I have a coral
one I like hot pink coral II top which
is like neon and makes you look tan even
if you're not so and especially if you
are tan it looks really good then I have
the matching like coral bottoms and
these ones are fancy because they only
have one little string on the side these
are like the single string bottoms and a
lot of minor double strings so yeah I
actually really really like this one
these don't have a matching top but I
just got the bottoms probably with any
one of those tops like these looks good
like and I also love like I love like
this together you know what I mean like
I love wearing ones that don't match and
rarely do I ever wear the matching ones
together because I like mixing and
matching like I like who would think
purple and yellow but it actually looks
so cute together
anywho these are the yellow bottoms
they're like Rouge like some of the
other ones but they're crochet which I
like love or like knit material you know
I really really really like these and I
wear them like all the time then the
last top like all of those is this plain
white one which of course gotta have a
plain white top I really really like
this one because it matches any one of
the bottoms it's so plain and simple
it's like awesome I just also have white
lace like crochet bottom just kind of
like those yellow ones these also match
like every
so they're really handy and they tie on
the side they like that I have two tops
from Victoria's Secret which are the
same top but in different colors I have
a coral one with hot pink ties and I
really like this because there's like a
little cutout where they like I think
it's really cool and these are also
really like pushup
just so you know I have the this is like
a light green I wouldn't even call it my
own it's more of like a light green with
like light blue ties actually look
really good on but they're just like
super expensive so you know I didn't
really mention the price of these I
don't really know the prints of them
like some of them I know you can get
like on say like I think a lot of these
be gone in sale and some of them we paid
full price
probably Victoria Secret is more
expensive than like other places I think
it's totally worth it like the quality
of them this purple one I've had for a
really long time and it is going strong
you know what I mean
like these don't fall apart at all like
they're like really really good quality
so I would totally recommend investing
in some of these I didn't mention they
have little like hooks at the top of all
of them and they come with straps I
never use a strap so I didn't like show
you so if you want to wear them with
straps you can but I just never do
because I like not having a tan line
right there like as you can see so from
Victoria's Secret this one's like my
baby this is like my first one I think I
ever got from there just a bandeau top
and it's
twisty right there and it has these
really pretty pastel colored stripes I
have a matching double string bottoms so
so cute oh my gosh
slap me how many times have I said I
really like this or so so cute or so
pretty in this video probably way too
much I'm really sorry then I also have
it in hot pink just a twisty bandeau top
have the matching hot pink bottoms to go
with these ones are really good for
tanning because you have like no tan
lines and they get really thin the
middle to this is a special one not like
any of the other ones and it's a white
bandeau top from Victoria's Secret and
it's like straight across and it has all
these fringes this one also looks good
with like any of the bottoms because
it's just white like I was saying before
I really really like these type of
bottoms that are all roughly and then
have like the Rouge butt right there and
I have them in cheetah which looks
really good it's like the black
Victoria's your top I have that like
you've been wearing this with like the
pink tops
roughly ones are really like flattering
on I would
saying and I also have the roughly kind
and it's like white floral penguin but I
suppose you have missed it
guys I found him but yet these are the
floral ones I was just talking about
better all roughly and I just found them
on my grounds these are probably on my
favorite ones just so you know this one
is from Target and I feel like a lot of
people have this one it's just like a
really pretty floral print with like
some navy blue and blue and like red
flowers and then the matching top which
I realize the style of this top you're
like cinders right there and it's kind
of like push up all of the tops like
this that I showed at Victoria's Secret
obviously they stands right there
they're like kind of push up but guys
really not push up that much at all
think there's a tiny little bit of
padding right there if you can tell
nothing like these words like the whole
thing is like push up do you know what I
mean
so these really they might even be
called like push up but they're not that
push up but these ones
totally totally are the rest look like
they're from Abercrombie and Hollister
this is a top from Abercrombie and it's
just a twisty bando one and it's like
light blue with like flowers and it's
really really cute I have the matching
bottoms also from Abercrombie is this
white top which has like all these
ruffles and it's just really cute and
like matches a lot too because it's
white I remember out where all the time
when I was younger because I never had
any boobs and I'd be like maybe if I
wear this with all the ruffles people
won't be able to tell them that
flat-chested I have two tops that are
kind of similar from Abercrombie one is
navy blue with some little loose on it
and has a cute little tie right there
and I have the matching bottoms don't
know where those one and then I also
have it in hot pink with some white
mooses moose mooses his moose is wrong I
don't know and then hot pink bottoms to
match with some white mousse mooses
isn't a thing it's moose right is it
like fish or fishes oh god guys don't
kill me
whatever then I have this one which is
really pretty floral again and it has
the ruffles has royal blue ties which i
think is cool the matching bottoms too
good with Owen look there's a little
like roughly thing right there but yeah
that one's really cute I like the floral
floral bathing suits always end up
looking good and this is the last one in
here and it's just some tribal eprint
kind of looks like a sunset or like
sherbert colors I don't know where the
bottoms are where is this one from
oh this one's from American Eagle and
it's an extra small but yeah I don't
know where it's bottoms went yeah this
one's really cute too so that's that I
don't know if you guys remember this bag
for my like back to school haul that I
did at the end of the summer but
remember this big baby that's what all
those beings are in thank you so much
