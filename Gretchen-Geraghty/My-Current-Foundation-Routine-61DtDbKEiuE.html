out of my face just so that I don't get
any of my products in my hair and
currently I've been using my doctor
darts BB cream um if you don't know BB
cream is it's kind of like an in-between
between tinted moisturizer and
foundation and it has all these great
benefits for your skin and I'm really
been liking it because my skin is like
in a pretty good condition right now so
I can get away with just two BB cream
and not like a foundation and then i use
my covergirl and Olay um like under eye
concealer and I really really love this
like it doesn't like settle into the
wrinkles or lines underneath your eyes
and its really brightening I absolutely
love it and then I didn't draw you but
I'm using a concealer from the bomb just
on any blemishes or like redness around
my nose and then I go and I set it all
with my mac mineralize skinfinish
natural in medium plus it's a little
dark but that's fine because I haven't
and from being on vacation anyway um and
then I go ahead and I take my too faced
chocolate soleil bronzer and i'm putting
that um kind of like on my cheekbones
with a big fluffy sigma brush and then i
read a little on my neck and then I take
my favorite blush it's kind of a good
peachy pink it from the bottom and it's
called frat boy and i'm using my like
sigma blush brush and that's what I do
like every day I absolutely love it then
my camera cuts off so thank you so much
for watching um yeah and today's my
birthday cakes your blunder all right
bye guys love you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
