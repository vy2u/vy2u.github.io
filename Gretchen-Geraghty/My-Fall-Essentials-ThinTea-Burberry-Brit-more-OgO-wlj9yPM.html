essentials for fall I have some clothes
I have some shoes some beauty some tea
to share with you so first I'll just
show you the tea that I've been drinking
and that I will be trying to drink in
the fall so it's actually by this brand
called thin tea and they have a 28 detox
blend in a 28-day fat-burn blend and
don't worry you can still eat food with
these you just drink the tea in the
morning I've before you eat food and
they're supposed to help you with a lot
of things cleanse and detoxify reduce
bloating speed up my metabolism suppress
your appetite burn fat all the things of
course I've actually been trying the 28
day detox blend just because it's
supposed to cleanse and detoxify I
haven't tried the fat-burning one yet
but so far so good
I'm totally recommend them and you guys
are trying to find a new tea and another
reason I really like these is because
there isn't caffeine in them which is
like a big thing for me I'm not really a
fan of caffeine I don't like the way it
affects your body and I will have it
linked down below so you can check it
out now I'll just get into my booty
essentials for fall so the first thing I
have to show you is just this hoola
bronzer from benefit and I'd say for the
fall time a really nice contouring
bronzer would be perfect because you're
losing your color from the summer sadly
so you want to still like shape your
face I have it still look really nice
and sunkissed so I definitely recommend
just like a nice dark bronzer that you
can use for contouring you don't want it
to be too shimmery I guess for
contouring you want like a matte bronzer
so that it just kind of sculpts your
face and then for fall I would recommend
a dark blush I actually just got this
one from Mac it's called plum flurry and
it's just this plum color it's pretty
shimmery I would say any plum blush will
work pretty well for the Fall I think
plum blushes look good on like a lot of
skin tones and for nail polish I just
grab these two colors to show you guys
and it really does not in to be the same
ones at all there's a bunch of different
brands you can obviously choose from and
these are just OPI the first one is
Linkin Park after dark and it's just
this really dark color it's so so dark
it almost looks black but it's actually
a really dark purple color and I think
it's perfect for the fall time and it's
not as harsh as black because I
personally don't really like the way
black nail polish it's on me
right now I'm wearing white and the
Linkin Park after dark is just a good
compromise because it's a very very dark
purple and then I grabbed this OPI one
which is Miss O'Leary's BBQ which is
just a dark maroon color so I love the
way roon
and I have this lipstick from Mac and I
think dark lipsticks if you feel
comfortable rocking them go for it for
me kind of depends on like the situation
I'm in for school I'm like I don't
really know if I'm comfortable having
thick dark lips but if you like go out
to dinner definitely slap on that dark
lipstick girlfriend this is just the mac
prolongwear lip cream in Red Dwarf I
think it was just like a limited edition
one while ago and it's just like this
dark maroon color so any dark lipstick
will do for the fall and then I just
have this eyeliner to show you this is
just the Mac eye Kohl in smolder any
black eyeliner will do just like a
pencil eyeliner and I like using a black
pencil eyeliner in the fall time
especially to tightline my eyes
sometimes it looks like a little bit too
much but in the fall time I think you
can get away with like darker makeup
that's why I love the fall because in
this number you don't really want to
wear too much because a lot of makeup
like caked on your face white and
everything but in the fall I like
wearing lots of eyeshadow and eyeliner
and I think it looks really good when
you tight line your eyes with black
eyeliner some people don't like it it's
a little harsh personally I like it I
think it gives you good definition and
then I grabbed a perfume to show you
this is just a Burberry one I believe
it's called Burberry Brit and it just
smells so good it's kind of like warm
vanilla smelling I think changing up
your sense for like each season is a
good idea that's kind of what I do I
have like one that I'll stick to and I'm
pretty sure this is gonna meet my fall
scent because it smells so good and sex
is kind of like your personal preference
I just like the way like vanilla based
one smell I just think they smell really
good so I tend to stick to those kind of
ones then for fashion for the Fall
obviously dark wash jeans for me I
really wear dark wash ones more I just
like the way they look I think you look
more kind of like crisp and like put
together with dark wash ones and light
wash ones I do have some light wash ones
and I think if you have light washed
jeans when they're ripped they look
really good but these are just like a
dark wash Jean with some rips in them I
really like the way it distressed jeans
look especially in the fall with some
booties which I'm about to show you
these are just from American Eagle
they're like the dark wash jeggings with
rips and I realized the way distressed
jeans look they look so good in the fall
with some booties these are just grabbed
as an example there are just these tan
booties from Steve Madden and I don't
know if you can get them anymore
I believe this style name of them is
called cinch and they just have a tiny
little heel they have these cute little
buckles so any kind of tan booties you
can get anywhere I know they have ones
that look like these actually I saw the
other day from forever 21 I love the way
booties look with some cuffed jeans in a
big comfy sweater so this dark gray
sweater is just from Toby any a big
comfy so it will do and you literally
can just slap it on with like some
leggings and put on some booties in some
dark lipstick and you look ready to go
even though it took you five minutes to
get ready another thing you can just
throw on is an army green jacket which i
think is definitely an essential for
fall time you can just literally throw
it over anything it'll keep you warm you
look stylish and this is from
Abercrombie almost forgot there and in
the last two things that for fall I have
to show you is for working out purposes
and these are just black long leggings
and these are my favorite ones ever
because they have pockets in the side
these are just the speed tights from
Lululemon and yeah I would say I mean
like good quality like kind of spandex e
long black leggings are perfect for the
fall because if you want to run outside
I like working outside so much more than
working out inside and I will run
outside for as long as I can literally
until December and you gotta stay warm
when it gets colder out in the fall so
definitely some like nice black leggings
are essential for the fall another
essential for running in the fall is
just a good pair of sneakers and my
favorite sneakers running are these blue
ones from Nike and I don't really know
what style they're called are just like
running and thicker ones you can run it
any kind of sneakers that work best for
you
yeah those are all my fault Central's I
hope it kind of helped you guys out and
preparing what you might need to get for
the Fall and yeah thank you so much for
watching and I'll see you my next video
