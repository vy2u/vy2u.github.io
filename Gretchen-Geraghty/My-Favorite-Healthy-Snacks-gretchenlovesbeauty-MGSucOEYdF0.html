healthy snacks video it just like you
guys requested and some of these snacks
aren't new at all I'm sure you've heard
of a lot of that they're just some of my
personal favorites so I wanted to let
you know what I eat like all the time
I'm just gonna throw this out here right
now I love peanut butter it's just
something that I'm not willing to give
up because I love it so don't say like
this isn't healthy because I know and
it's better than going and eating
brownies and ice cream you know and also
I'm not wearing a lick of makeup which
usually doesn't happen in my videos and
if you try any of these little snack
ideas definitely take a picture and
tweet it at me I'd love to see your
little recreation it's mostly like
fruits and vegetables they're really
really simple and easy so quick I just
really like all of these snack ideas and
I hope you like them too and I hope you
enjoy now the first snack idea is yogurt
with fruit and granola and the first
thing you need is a bowl maybe some
strawberries blueberries or raspberries
and just your favorite granola I use
Greek yogurt just the Chobani like
vanilla kind I know you can also get
plain you can just put as much Cronulla
as you want and i do a lot of
blueberries because i like that and i
decided to add some raspberries and this
is really good for maybe breakfast or
just a quick little snack before or
after some practice and i really like
that one now my next favorite snack is
ants on a log
and you just start off with some rinsed
celery and I'm cutting it up into
smaller little pieces and then I just
put peanut butter I just cover the tops
in peanut butter and a whole lot because
like I said before I love peanut butter
and then I used to actually not like
raisins but I realize they're actually
really yummy and pretty sweet too and
they taste so good with this combination
I'm just obsessed with it so yeah I
really like this and I'm eating it as a
quick little snack before work and then
if you don't have time for that you can
also just grab a quick granola bar just
make sure it's pretty healthy and this
is just a Kashi one that I really like
now the next one is turkey lettuce wraps
which are really my favorite and Lucy
and I just figured this out because it's
kind of like a healthier alternatives
like a sandwich like a bunch of bread so
you start off with some rinsed
and that's my favorite type of Turkey
then you can do mustard like that in the
middle or some cranberry Mayo I really
really like this one it's like just so
yummy and addicting and the lettuce it
makes it taste really fresh and just
crisp and so good I love it now the next
one is a rice cakes with peanut butter
and bananas and this one is really
really yummy this is Lucy's absolute
favorite and you just start off with
some plain rice cakes and you cover it
in peanut butter once again love peanut
butter and then you just slice up some
bananas that you can put on oh there I
am slicing up the bananas and you just
put them on just on top just like that
and this tastes so good it's like
crunchy and sweet and it's also not that
bad for you because rice cakes are
pretty good for you they have like no
calories and then the peanut butter is
not that good but then the bananas are
good they're fruit and if you don't have
rice cakes you can eat bananas just with
peanut butter which is literally my
favorite thing ever I'm absolutely
obsessed with it
I just eat bananas and peanut butter all
the time now the last one is vegetables
and dip which Lucy and I also really
like maybe for lunch or dinner and you
start off with maybe some baby carrots
I'm cutting up a red pepper here and
then I cut up some cucumber and then
we're adding Ted Zekey sauce and hummus
which are both of our favorite dips
they're both pretty good for you hummus
is just made out of chickpeas and we
love it it's so good it's like nice and
salty tasting kind of I don't know how
to describe it but you gotta try and
then to Zeki sauce is kind of like
yogurt II I don't know it's really good
though and then we love dipping
vegetables in it so yeah that's really
good and there's Lucy and I fighting
after our crew practice there's some
yummy vegetables
it's literally addicting - it's so good
and then also we love pretzel crisps
which are a healthy alternative to like
chips so we're up stoves and they also
taste really good with hummus and tajiki
sauce so that is that
but I hope you enjoyed all these little
snack ideas and like I said before
definitely tweet me a picture if you try
that my twitter is that Glu ID and my
Instagram is gremlins beauty but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
