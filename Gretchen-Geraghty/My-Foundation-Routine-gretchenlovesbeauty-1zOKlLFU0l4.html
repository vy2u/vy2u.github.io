foundation routine which has been highly
requested and I've been putting it off
for a while just because I wanted to
wait till my skin cleared up so I could
film a video without any makeup in the
beginning so this is me with absolutely
no makeup and I am in such a good mood
right now because I actually have a snow
day for school hold on let me show you
don't look at how snowy it is but yeah
somewhat this video if you're excited
for this foundation routine and it's
just what I wear when I wear my
foundation to school I'm gonna like
finish it off with my makeup and stuff
just so you couldn't see like what I
would wear on an everyday basis cuz I'm
just gonna get ready for today wait guys
okay sorry this is probably confusing I
know I have makeup on that what this is
cuz this is after I filmed this video
but I forgot to tell you I actually made
a tumblr and I'm totally looking newbie
and I don't even know how to do it or
anything but I just want like let you
know cuz it's for my youtube and it's
Gretchen loves beauty with two eyes
tumblr comm I'm really new to it and it
really confuses me so I guess like
follow me is that how it goes oh my gosh
don't touch my file excite that wrong I
do like follow people on tumblr I think
follow our friends like Facebook I don't
know I have no idea I have to have my
friend handle I teach me how to use it
because I don't know what I'm doing but
yeah so I just want to throw this in
really quick I did make a tumblr it's
Russian lips beauty with two eyes at
tumblr calm because Gretchen loves
beauty with fun while I was already
taken follow me I guess and so now you
can see this is how my makeup ends up
looking I think we're gonna go take a
photo shoot now so maybe at the end of
this video stay tuned we can put in some
cute pictures from our photo shoot I
think I'm gonna go throw my hair okay
bye so let's just get into it
so my hair is finally grown out a little
bit so I have to put it up before I
start my makeup and I'm just twisting it
up into a bun and first I'm using just
my Cetaphil moisturizing really good
under my makeup and I like this
moisturizer a lot
now I'm using the Porefessional primer
from benefit and I really like the way
it works under my makeup as well it just
does a really good job at like hiding
your pores because I have like really
big pores my face and just makes your
foundation look really good then I'm
using this concealer it's like a
rollerball from like Garnier I believe
and I'm using my Beauty letter to apply
my foundation and I had to go and get it
wet so it gets kind of bigger and it
just makes your foundation look really
nice and I'm using this covergirl
foundation it's like three and one stay
fabulous I want to say it's called and I
know it's in the shade 840 and I just
blend this all over my face and it
doesn't match my face perfectly but it's
like a little bit darker since it's like
winter and my face is like really pale
but yeah and like I said in the
beginning in this video my skin is
pretty clear right now but I'm using a
concealer from fair minerals and it
works really really well too and the
powder I'm using is also from covergirl
just like my foundation but this one is
in the shade 835 and I like this powder
for a while it just makes your
foundation look really nice like over
top of your foundation then I'm using a
bronzer from hoola and I was just
showing you I only use a little bit my
brushes are clean so you can see like
just how little I use and I'm just like
blending this on my cheekbones I make it
a little fishy face and then I also put
it on like the temples of my forehead
because I like to look like sun kissed I
always wear like a lot of bronzer
especially in the winter because I just
like pretend I'm Jan you know so yeah I
really like that bronzer a lot and then
there's Hanna saying hello Lucy in
Hanover like chilling was filming this
video then I'm using a blush from NARS
that I use use a lot and I really really
like it it's called deep throat I think
officiated which just looks pretty
vulgar but I just really like that blush
a lot it's like a pretty color and then
I'm using a u.s. lip balm and it's mushy
like sweet vanilla mint it's like mint
you know
it's really really cool and then I'm
curling my eyelashes and I always kind
of like run my fingers through them
after to make sure they're not all like
clumping together and then I'm using
this thing from the benefit it's called
high brow it's like a highlighting so
that you can put under your eyebrows or
unlike the inner corner of your eye
which is there I like to put it and I'm
cracking my neck
well it's cracks turn mic all the time
so I do I think it's like bad for your
neck but I always do it anyway so that
was bad uh-huh then I'm using my
favorite eyeliner and it's really hard
to show on camera so I did some of the
off-camera and I kind of blend it
underneath my eyes too so that's what
the eyeliner looks like when it's all
said and done there was a man talking to
me again and then I'm using my favorite
mascara which can you guess it's the
L'Oreal telescopic carbon black mascara
she said soils funny I think so so I was
looking at her like that but yeah I love
that mascara and I just poked myself in
the eye so that's why I was stupid but
that is that so thanks for watching
all right okay doing a little sneak
preview of this setup so I actually took
that mirror off of that door if you've
ever seen videos filmed in here like the
boyfriend tag I know you could see the
mirror right there but I took it off so
I could put it right there
so I could see myself when I was filming
so that's why that's there there's my
tripod sorry I digress but here's my OH
meal it's the Quaker um maple brown
sugar oatmeal with like this vanilla
almond butter the best thing ever it's
so good and half of banana it's the best
breakfast ever</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
