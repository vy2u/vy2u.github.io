school advice video this video has been
requested so so much because a lot of
you I know we're actually going into
high school as freshmen and a lot of you
are just still in high school but I
graduated this year as a senior so I
have a lot of advice to share I actually
made a list of my phone of tips that I
have to share with you guys and then I
let you guys ask some questions that you
have about high school I tweeted out to
you guys to tweet me some questions so I
have a bunch of those too and yeah
that's basically gonna be this whole
video so let's just get into it so the
first thing I want to mention is that
just know your first day of high school
freshman year like starts your GPA that
college is both si I don't know that's
really self-explanatory and like most of
you probably know that but I did not
know that freshman year like I didn't
know going into it so like freshman
sophomore junior and senior year all
averaged together is the GPA that
colleges will see so you want to make
sure you're trying just as hard freshman
year don't say it doesn't matter now
kids it really does if the second thing
I ever done is trotted out going to
everyone and don't what first
impressions mean too much because I know
it sometimes it's easy to just be
friends with the people that you've
always been friends with and kind of
like be shy and feel awkward in front of
new people but you don't want to have
any regrets which is like a later tip
that I have you don't have any regrets
when you leave high school so definitely
just try to be outgoing and like really
nice to everyone because you could also
make friends that you never knew that
you'd be friends with everyone's just as
nervous as you are especially like
freshman year so I would say just be
really open to the different kind of
people that you'll be friends with and
your friends will change like so much
through high school which I get into
also the third thing I wrote down is
that freshman year was actually really
fun like it was one of my favorite years
and although I was kind of in hurt to
have that many friends it was so so so
much fun like I don't know I just had a
blast freshman year maybe it's because I
didn't know that my GPA counted and I
like didn't try
hard in school and was just focused on
hanging out my friends I had some
friends like Corinne and Lucy that was
it
I don't also wanted to say that you
don't get shoved in a locker like it
won't happen I promise you freshman year
is not that bad anyone that's trying to
tell you that it's bad is just trying to
scare you I promise like your safety is
not something to worry about your
freshman you will be fine the fourth
thing I wrote down is take fun classes
that interest you because I definitely
would have taken some more fun classes
if I had time in my schedule or if I
just had thought about it earlier in
high school I definitely would've taken
like photography or like send them all
like cool classes like that but instead
I just did like Spanish and like other
electives kind of things but if you have
time on your schedule just take like fun
classes I would do them now while
they're fruity because in college of
course I can take like cinema or like
photography if I want to but in college
like you're paying for those classes and
like in high school at least if you go
to like a public school like I did
they're free so like why not take them
while you can
the fifth thing I wrote down is learn to
prioritize and have good time management
because you're going to have things that
come before others like if you have math
homework and like history homework you
definitely have to do that before you go
play video games you have good time
management because if you're like me
you're up until like 5:00 in the morning
doing homework and like editing videos
and doing stuff that's really important
so try to plan out your time as best you
can with like fun and important things
the next thing I wrote down is you
really don't want to leave high school
with any regrets because I don't I don't
have I don't have many like regrets but
there's definitely some things that I
would have liked change so I guess in
that aspect I do definitely don't want
to leave with any sort of regrets
because then you'll just like think
about them a lot so I think that if
there's a guy that you think is really
cute or like a girl that you think is
really popular or pretty and like out of
your league like friendship wise or same
thing with the guy do you think he's
look out of your league I would say just
go for it because you might think you
have a lot to lose but like in all
honesty you don't know high school is
four years long and I know it seems like
the biggest deal ever when you're there
but like say like five ten years from
now you will barely remember anything
you'll remember probably the really good
moment and the really bad moment so I
would say just go for it like the worst
thing that can happen is they say no you
might be a little sad a little
heartbroken for a little while but
you'll get over it like it's not the end
of the world and half the time you could
be surprised it's like I'm like oh they
would never be friends of me or like I'm
not gonna waste my time talking that guy
at all like he would never like me like
that was always me I never thought
Justin would like me I probably thought
he was cute like freshman year or
something but I was I would never even
like admit to myself that I liked him
because I was too scared so I would say
just go for it you won't see most of the
kids in your high school again which is
kind of sad but look if you go up to a
different college then most of the kids
in your school you probably won't see a
lot of them again so what they think
although in the moment kind of matters
because you'll be spending time with
them in the long run it doesn't matter
at all try to be on time as best you can
because then that shows your teachers
that you care and just classmates and
everything so I would say at the end
time to class man time to school being
on time in general is just a good lesson
for life I would say
so always stay after with teachers and
ask for help
look even if you're scared because they
seriously will love you like stay after
school it means so much to a teacher if
kids are staying after and asking for
help because they will help you and
they'll help you out with topics that
you're not so strong on they'll know to
the kids that are staying after and
they're helping flicky fair if their
average four quarters an eighty nine and
they might bump you up that extra point
to get in and you're like if you're
trying really hard on a test and you
don't do well they might get you extra
credit because they know that you're
working at it so I would say definitely
like work with the teacher because they
understand where you're coming from and
they can help you a lot my last tip is
to have fun and try not to care too much
because I know high school can be really
stressful and everything but just try to
have fun as best as you can and you will
get through it I promise
then we'll move on to the Twitter
questions I have from you guys and one
of the questions I have is how did you
make money in high school so I've
actually had like three different jobs
kind of one is YouTube one is over the
summer I lifeguard at like these pools
outside near my house and then another
place that I live for that it's just the
YMCA near my house but also if you guys
are looking for a way to make money
that's really easy and just online at
this place called Opinion Outpost and i
know i've talked about it and maybe one
or two videos before but it's just this
website where you can do surveys on
things that companies want to know about
like it can be like new movies new food
like stuff like that and you can just
give your opinions and get paid for them
so Opinion Outpost gave me this link
that you can check out down below in the
description box and click on that if you
are interested this mission says do you
look back on your freshman year and when
she could have done anything different I
probably like I said earlier I probably
would have started trying harder in
school earlier because I didn't really
know that colleges would be seeing my
grades from the beginning of my freshman
year next one says how do you stay out
of drama and I would say just try to not
involve yourself with people that are
really dramatic or like
attention-seeking like that kind of
thing is when says how did you mountains
crew along with YouTube on top of school
basically I didn't it was really hard to
screw with YouTube and school just
because crew would be like after school
and then I would have to like put
YouTube in there somewhere so it's
really hard but I would say just try to
like look at your schedule as best you
can and like plan out your time like I
said earlier like time management
this one says what is your snapchat name
it's Gretchen with five ends in case you
didn't know this isn't really related
this one says his freshman year really
hard and no it wasn't honestly like it
was not as hard as like sophomore or
junior senior year like high school
keeps getting harder obviously as you go
on so I really didn't struggle that much
to freshman year I thought it was pretty
easy to be honest this once I was out of
all the years in high school what was
your hardest class to complete and that
was probably physics or chemistry just
because I remember studying shows so
much in chemistry and I'm actually
taking it on my fall semester as a
freshman in college so I know I'm gonna
struggle with that too I'll probably
have to get like tutors or something
because chemistry just for me is so hard
so yeah I'm taking physics out of that
physics wasn't as bad as chemistry
chemistry is definitely the worst this
one says how did you get recruited for
rowing and I think I'm just gonna save
this for my like rowing Q&amp;amp;A video which
I actually tried to film and my camera
like wasn't working and just didn't work
out and I know I tweeted at once like
leave your questions down below but I
still haven't even filmed it I'm really
sorry so can you like leave me a comment
down below if it would be helpful for
you guys if I filmed at the rowing Q&amp;amp;A
video and I'll answer like all your
questions and everything so just leave
me a comment down below if you still
want that I'm really sorry I know I said
I had to film it forever
this one says and people make fun of you
for doing your YouTube videos and yes
they definitely did I would say ever
since people found out like people were
always kind of making fun of me not
really to my face but more like behind
my back but I guess you just kind of
have to ignore anyone that has a YouTube
channel that's watching this No
I'm talking about by the way I try to
fish out on my hair today but I'm really
bad at it so sorry if it looks all crazy
this one says what was your experience
with keeping a balanced schedule with
school and your free time honestly guys
it's really hard and I'm not an expert
at this I would say really late doing
like homework assignments or like
editing YouTube videos and I like
struggled with it a lot and if any of
you followed my vlogmas throughout
December I didn't sleep all throughout
December because I literally was up to
like 4 a.m. every single night I'm not
kidding
editing that today's video and like
trying to get up the ones the night
before it was just really hard for me so
I would say just know your schedule know
your time and know what you have to do
and try to plan it the best that works
for you that would be my advice I'm not
the best at it
this one says did you end high school
with the same friends you started with
and no definitely not my friends changed
a lot so that will happen with you guys
too I'm sure
business is what was your thought in the
first day of high school I can tell you
I don't know if I mentioned this to you
guys but everyone's over here every year
on the first day of high school I cried
it was probably sad because I ended up
crying later and just nervous as can be
like I just always get so nervous on the
first day of school because I have
really hard time coping with change so I
was probably really nervous and couldn't
believe that it was the first day and
that I had to be with all me people in
everything this will be the last one
that I answer and it says do you feel
judged by anyone because you did YouTube
and I kinda answered this before like
yes like people will always have
something to say but you're on YouTube
or even if you're not and people are
like talking about you I would just try
to say like stay out of it as best you
can
all that matters is that you're happy
for yourself so I can't stress enough
like high school is only four years
you'll get through it
I promise and what matters most is what
comes after high school so make sure
academics are like the first thing
because that is what will prepare you
for what comes after high school and
that's what will get you into a good
college and if you haven't noticed
justin has been watching me from this
whole video and the lighting has changed
so much now the lights like over here
and my face looks dark so sorry that's
driving you crazy and we're finally
going to end this video now I'm sorry
so so long but thank you so much for
watching I'll see my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
