night was warm so today is just a day
where I don't have crew practice in the
morning so I don't wake up with an alarm
or anything I just wake up naturally and
once I've woken up it usually takes me a
while to actually get out of bed so
first I'll just hang out with my girl
April that's my bunny who has a pink
onesie on I love her so much and I
always up to sleep with her then I'll
just go on my phone and I usually scroll
through Twitter you guys can follow me
it's at GLB whitey and I like to look
through my notifications and I will
favorite all of your guys's tweets that
I see because I love with you guys paint
me stuff I just go on Instagram and my
personal Instagram is anti Gretchen with
five ends at the end and my youtube one
is a dick Gretchen loves beauty so you
should definitely pull me on there too
because I'm obsessed with Instagram then
I'll just go on iMovie and I'll edit
some videos and then my favorite part is
going through comments on my recent
YouTube videos and I love replying to
your guys's comments it's so much fun so
always leave me a comment on my youtube
videos as well then I just make my way
over to my bathroom and the first thing
I'm doing is reversing my teeth pretty
sure that's self-explanatory
then I actually don't wash my face in
the morning I usually just rinse it off
with water because that's just what
works best for my skin so I just rinse
it off with water and I Pat it dry my
hair is actually straight from the day
before I just straightened it and then
I'm just putting on some lip balm I'm
actually not even singing on any makeup
because I'm going into hot yoga to go to
hot yoga some mornings before I
lifeguard which is where I work over the
summer so I just do a yoga some mornings
when I don't have crew and now I'm
changing into my yoga clothes they're
just these blue Lululemon leggings I
just got them I'm like obsessed with
them and this white tank top which is
also from Lululemon and they're like the
best for going to hot yoga because you
get really hot and sweaty they're like
seriously so hot and then I'm putting my
hair up in a ponytail because you don't
want the best to get in the way while
you're yoga then I grab my yoga mat and
I just head my way downstairs
and usually I don't like eating too much
before I go to yoga or I workout but I
need to eat something so that I don't
starve and this morning I just ate some
melon that I cut up at the night before
and it's just something to get your
metabolism going in the morning
then I just grab my Nalgene and I fill
it up with ice water to bring taught
yoga and I seriously drink so much water
when I'm at yoga because it gets so hot
in there and I drink like seriously that
whole analogy and like it so they do and
I really like going to yoga on mornings
I don't have crew practice because it's
just a way to unwind and hang out with
my twin sister Lucy holy moly that one
was so hot it was just really tiring
we're literally so yeah we had an
instructor that we like I hope you
enjoyed my morning routine it's been
requested so so much I can't even tell
you and I had lots of fun filming it
this morning sadly as you can kind of
tell it was like raining and kind of
dark out so it's kind of hard to make
the lighting alright but I tried my best
like I said usually that's just like my
routine if I don't have crew practice
which is pretty much every day except
for Sunday so it's kind of like a Sunday
morning routine for summer so sometimes
if I don't have crew I'll do yoga and
then I'll go to work so yeah that's just
what it looks like for a typical morning
for me but thank you so much for
watching and I will see you my next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
