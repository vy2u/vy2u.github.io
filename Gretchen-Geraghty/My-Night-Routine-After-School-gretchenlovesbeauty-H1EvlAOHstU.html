I do on a fall night after school and I
was super excited to film this video
because it's been requested for a while
so yeah I have a lot of fun filming this
and it just goes through everything I do
after school and so the first thing I'm
doing is getting home from school and
Lucy and I are seniors so we actually
get home pretty early so I will just eat
lunch when I get the most Hays because I
need to bring food to school because we
get home so early
so today I just felt like making some
muhammad's and myrtles and carrots and
if you watch my last video which is what
I eat in the day you would see that in
there cuz I've only something day and
then there's my dog Ozzy's a huge Great
Dane and I usually just hang out with
them a little bit and kind of Cathie's
really nice funny gallon then I'm just
going upstairs and I usually take this
time after I eat lunch to like do some
homework or like procrastinate pretend
like I'm doing homework and I only
usually like um never take enough why
she was getting comfy but I'll usually
try to start my homework or I will get
distracted and like on my phone like
that and I think Justin called me so I
talked to him for a while and he
distracted me some more and then I was
like on my computer and answering some
comments on YouTube that's like my
favorite thing ever I love like reading
you coming to lips and when you guys
cool toys mentally interact and yeah I'm
drying I have to do some homework
usually - okay - much accomplished and
more like finish it later um but then it
is time to go to the gym and before that
if you see my hair it's a greatly curl
and I was thinking of doing a separate
video and I how I curled it without
anything like you know
it's like a love slave a little comment
but yeah I didn't use any heat for that
and yeah so I just get changed by the
gym I'm I think on my little speakers
and getting ready to go and usually
listen I will just go to the gym every
single day and actually them on November
we had off of career practice I know you
guys most of you know that Lucy nairo
and for the month of November we just
have a month off so we will just work
out everyday on our own we go to the gym
to yoga is like my favorite thing ever
so today we're just going to the gym as
usual and feels like to switch it up a
lot of time so sometimes they run and I
will go on the treadmill and we'll see
like the track so there I am like
filming here running on the track and
this was like super awkward and weird
but I wanted some like footage of what I
did so today I think I just ran like
four five miles and then we was
stretched out with some core after but I
really didn't chose half and then after
we get home and I'm usually starving
because I believe I'll be temporary and
I just eat all the time and also I
showed this in my last video but I just
made a little salad with some chicken
and add some crazy that's like my
favorite
okay so yummy so then after I eat dinner
I just go upstairs and hop in the shower
and usually a shower a while like my
showers just take forever I like
relaxing the show and then I change into
my pajamas and my hair is a big fat
that's usually after it's all at tangley
so I just put in some leave-in
conditioner and I know this is so bad
I'm gonna get a million comments saying
how bad it is and I know it's bad but do
use a brush with my hair's wet I know
it's awful it breaks your hair and
everything but I'm just too lazy and
it's just the easiest so I'm sorry that
bothers you then
just using some moisturizer mayonnaise
because I actually brush my teeth and
wash my face in the showers so that's
why you need to see that I'm now putting
on to the poor Kings eye cream because
why not and then I put up my retainers
which are stupid cute then I put on some
chapstick as well and then now I will
usually um watch Netflix forever until
the late hours of the night or I go to
bed and I'm obsessed with scandals
that's what I'm watching right now then
I get too tired before I fall asleep and
thank you so much for watching I'll see
you my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
