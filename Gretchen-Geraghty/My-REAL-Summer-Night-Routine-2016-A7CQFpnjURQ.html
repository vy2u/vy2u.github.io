night routine for summer
so tonight I'm just getting home from a
dinner and movie with my friend Justin
and the first thing I'm doing is just
grabbing some ice water because I'm
literally obsessed with ice water I like
barely drink any other drinks than my
father
and yeah I guess I was just thirsty and
I like to keep hydrated so now I'm just
going on my phone I'm sort of obsessed
with it I'm honey like way too much and
now I'm just snap chatting if you don't
follow me you totally should my user
name is Gretchen with Simon so yeah go
add me I post stories like probably a
million every day and then I'm just
heading my way upstairs to get unready
for the night and as you can tell I went
for a pretty casual outfit anyway I was
trying to be comfy like it becomes me
especially when I'm going it's like
movies you know I'm plugging in my phone
yeah I'm just wearing like joggers and a
crop top and oh my gosh that black crop
top oh he's like the falls off the side
but when I was in saying I usually like
plop down on my bed and like almost fall
asleep before I start getting on ready
yet cuz I'm like so lazy but the first
thing I'm doing is just putting up my
hair and look at how much makeup I'm
wearing like a little range so much so
especially when I wear a lot I like to
use the LA roche-posay it's just as
micellar water I really hope I said all
that right and it just works so well I
take my makeup off I usually use a
cotton ball or a cotton rounder to take
all the makeup off of my face and then I
use one to take off my neck as well it
just works so well to take up on my
makeup like I love it and I won't have
it linked down below in case you were
interested and my ponytail kept falling
in front of my things that I was trying
to get it wet I like taking off my
makeup before I use my cleanser up and
bring a lot so that I feel like really
clean you know and I'm obsessed with
trying like new cleansers and face
washes and everything of that sort so I
don't even know exactly what conger that
was that day I'm gonna be changing up
all the time but I'm always loving
trying out new things and I just Pat my
face dry and this is one of my favorite
moisturizers of all time this is just
the Cetaphil moisturizing cream it works
so well and my skin gets pretty dry
especially like at night when I wake up
in the morning it's a Keeley so I like
to wear like a pretty thick cream
during night and then I'm just using
this eye cream I don't even remember but
branches but PS who else is obsessed
with this song right now I'm literally
obsessed with this song
wait I'm literally ready I'm just
getting out my toothbrush to it brush my
teeth and I realize I don't have
toothpaste today I know a toothpaste No
so after I successfully steal Lucy stood
face I'm just brushing my teeth like
normal and yeah it's pretty
self-explanatory okay feel weird why
shake my teeth on camera but that's just
that I've been feeling really bad
recently so I haven't been wearing every
day no one changed me and then I just go
flying into my bed
just kidding like who actually does that
it was really fun to film and then I
magically it changed in my pajamas like
how cool is that
and then I'm using some my computer for
a little bit just usually reply to your
guys's comments or answering emails but
ever and then who actually sleeps with
all those details on their bed I just
usually throw them on the ground so yeah
that is it for my summer night routine
thank you guys so much for watching and
I'll see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
