Oh
let's just
hey everyone so this is just going to be
my college morning routine including my
makeup routine first school this year at
Boston University and I've been so
excited to own this video for you guys
because it's been it so requested for
those of you that are looking at bu or
for those of you that are just wondering
what a morning is like for a college
student so this is actually films on a
Friday morning and I don't have class
until 9:00 and usually I'll get up at
7:30 but today I just woke up before my
alarm that keeps happening and it's so
annoying so I woke up around 7:00 as you
saw and I'm just getting out of bed and
I like to make my bed in the morning
right after I get up because it just
helps me stay productive so I just throw
in some pillows straighten out my little
duvet and we are good to go so recently
the first thing I've been jamming to is
doing my makeup and it just makes my
morning a lot more efficient I feel and
I'm just going on my Spotify which my
username is Gretchen with five and she
should follow me on the hair and today
I'm just listening to some tippling rock
which is like one of my new favorite fan
my friend show me them and I really love
them and that's the music that he's been
playing in this video so if you're
wondering about that I will have them
linked down below and you should follow
their Spotify you can even let them know
I send you it I've been using all these
new brushes which guys I am seriously
obsessed with and I've been using them
for about a month now and I know I
showed them in a vlog video where I was
just raving about them because they're
so amazing and I got them up purely out
of frustration with other brushes that
I've had that actually shed on my face
and leave a little brush hairs on my
face and it just drives me crazy
so these brushes don't shed guys they're
so great and they just come in this set
it's usually a hundred dollars but if
you use my coated crach you can actually
get 70% off and you can get the brush
set for only $30 so I think that is so
amazing I cannot talk about them enough
they're just so great and I would highly
highly highly highly recommend them for
anyone that is looking for some really
good quality brushes so I'll have them
linked all down below and everything and
also in case you're wondering throughout
all my makeup right here I'm not talking
about each product in specific because
just like a morning routine and all of
all the makeup products I'm using a
links down below as well so you saw me
put on my foundation already which is
just the Kat Von D lock-it foundation
and I've heard such good things about it
I just picked it up and I've been using
it and I loved it already I don't even
have to wear concealer guys that's how
like full coverage it is and I just yeah
I just been loving it and then you saw
me attempt to make my face and still not
that good at it I just
the Laura Mercier powder and then I just
put on some eyeshadow primer and now I'm
just doing it some neutral eyeshadow I
use the Naked basics palette then I'm
within the way under my eyes where I get
an attempt to cheat with fake my face
and then now I'm just curling my
eyelashes and putting on some liquid
eyeliner I believe this is from Milani
like I said all the things below then my
everyday makeup routine video guys you
yelled at me for putting liquid eyeliner
on the bottom underneath my eyes but I
like the way it looks okay so I'm just
going to do it how I like to do it you
know everyone is our makeup different
I'm not perfect no one's perfect okay
and then I've been using two different
kinds of mascara like I showed you one
is from car and one is from L'Oreal and
then now I'm just doing my brows and
he's the Anastasia brow pomade and I
believe I mean soft brown and people
have said that my brow game has gotten
way stronger recently because I've been
filling them in more and I've been
letting them grow out and trying to make
them like a little bit thicker because
people said they're too thin and like
far apart whatever so they have been
improving and I'm just using I believe
this is from honest eyes - it's like the
contour little palette thanks Hannah
shoutout and I got with me like my
birthday look a year ago or something
but I just love it and I started off
actually with the middle shade in the
palette on the bottom which is just like
a lighter contour and then I like to
build it up and I add more which is like
all the way to the left colors a bit
darker Brown
and then I saw I just put on some up
flush which is Dallas from benefit I
like that it's like a darker blush and
then I just put on some Abeka highlights
in the shade opal so yeah I just showed
my makeup a little bit but I show it
again in a little bit where it's like
better lighting like here in my bathroom
now I'm just going to brush my teeth as
usual
pretty self-explanatory and yeah this is
just the bathroom I share with like
three other girls my sweet cuz aren't if
you know there's like eight people in my
suite and then yeah so I just shared
with like this feeding on Sam okay now
I'm boiling it some water in my little
water heater
oh here's my makeup look at mine I told
you because it's like better lighting
but um yeah I like boil my water which
takes like a couple minutes you know
because I literally eat oatmeal like
every morning for breakfast and that I
just make in my room it's just the games
it's just really easy and I picked on my
outfit the night before so it's just
sitting out on my dresser and I'm
actually wearing a Lucy's a white
sweater it's like new it's from
Abercrombie and then I just have some
dark wash Abercrombie jeans that are
like boyfriend and my crimped and then
I'm wearing some Steve Madden booties
but all my show this outfit and like it
out for the week so just wait for that
to come out because then you'll see you
like more in depth you know oh and then
I'm just like making my homey letting
like the water sit in it and I cook it
while I straighten my hair like I said
guys I've been trying like be efficient
and like see like let my oatmeal cook
while I'm like doing my hair you know I
try to like beat up my morning so anyway
I'm just using the chi air flatiron and
I've just been using this like forever
and I love it it's like one my themes so
literally straight my hair takes so
quick because I like no hair my head is
like really thin and I'm just like very
messy with it I don't even section it
off really I just kind of do it in
little layers and whatever and yeah it
takes like three minutes edges with some
almond butter my homie land kind of a
banana because it is the best ever is so
good and that is literally what I eat
every day
now I'm describing my Hydra flask which
is like my favorite water bottle and
then my phone turning out my lights so I
can head off to class so yeah thank you
