like super offensive video
it's my skincare routine or my skincare
story you just tried filming this but it
was like 20 minutes on so I'm gonna try
to wrap it up and make it quicker I also
just filmed a everyday makeup tutorial
that I will be putting up soon so yeah I
finally found some makeup videos but
let's just get into a video all about my
skin and kind of advice for you guys if
you're struggling with your skin
everything like that I also want to say
that I'm not an expert at all like I'm
just kind of telling you what's the deal
with me I don't you know like all
through middle school my skin was like
perfectly fine and then 9th grade as
well at freshman year my skin was okay
then like 10th grade all of a sudden I
started getting acne and I didn't know I
was coming from and so I went to a
dermatologist and he gave me this stuff
called the retina it worked but a few
weeks and it cleared up my skin and I
was like yes finally I started like not
working the same I get used to dry out
my skin and like kind of like my acne
too and I think what happens is I don't
know this is like actually a thing or
just me telling myself it is that um I
think my skin kind of gets used to like
skin products like my skin will just get
used to it after a while so it like
stops working the same but I don't know
if that's correct like at all and then I
finally I'm back to my dermatologist and
I was like this isn't working the same
and what I ended up doing which is like
totally not recommended at all I was
really frustrated what am retin-a like
stopped working for me so I started
using my sister's acne medication I
don't know what I was thinking but she
like told me it works so I was like I'm
gonna try it like what do I got to lose
and it's this stuff called Wolle and I
still have it even though I don't
currently use it I would get into that
oh so I remember I was on Trenton Owen
which is like retin-a I was on not
originally and then I used this which
combines like two different medicines
and one clindamycin phosphate and try
and no Angele that's not my
dermatologist said like you know what
sometimes it's weird sometimes ii was
like better than one like two medicines
work better than one look if they're
like combined like it works differently
i don't know why i like the skin is
weird like that so this worked for a
real long time i used it like all like
in the fall and the spring and then it
hit summertime and i was like a
lifeguard so i
works like every day in the Sun and the
Sun clears up my skin like it just
straight-up does like if my skin is like
tan or even burn which is probably bad
for you know like skin cancer um when I
would get tan or anything like that my
skin was like perfectly fine like I
don't wear makeup all summer long
I actually was bad that I stopped using
this because I was like I didn't even
see the need to like you something for
acne when I didn't have it so I just
like stopped using it so awesomer long
all I really did was like wash my face
like whatever I didn't use like
medication and then like fall going into
the winter like this past fall winter if
you guys haven't noticed I haven't put
up makeup videos and such a long time
because frankly I was just embarrassed
my skin was so so bad so and I met - her
dermatologist um like in the fall and I
was like looking at like my acne was
worse than it's ever been and for a
while he's been saying cuz ever since
the beginning like I am pretty severe
like acne like you can't tell I can
cover it up and right now my team is
pretty good but I was pretty good at
covering it up looking until all my old
videos when my skin looks fine and
you're like what are you talking about
like no makeup is a pretty great thing
um but so for a while he was like
recommending that I go on medicine like
like not this medicine like this is like
topical stuff that you put on your face
that like night but like actual like
oral pills and I was kind of against
that for a while like I kind of don't
like taking like medication if I don't
have to UM but I was like you know what
my skin's okay look I'll try anything so
I went on and they were like antibiotics
I believed it was called like
minocycline or like dice I clean
something like that and it was for the
past like two months and I'll just take
it every night and I had to make sure I
was taking it like the same time because
it was like antibiotics
he's like stuff you have on your face
now it'll make it look go away quicker
and then I also got a different one of
these um which is this which is the one
that I use now um to like go with it
he's like like I don't have sensitive
scanning he's like frankly like this is
like the strongest stuff I prescribe and
it's called
tasman track has a routine cream so this
is what I use now and I put on my face
at night and I used it with the
medication and like during that was like
2 months when I was taking my
antibiotics I didn't notice that much of
a difference and I was like getting
really
then I went to Florida for a week and I
don't know if you like saw my for the
video but like I said the Sun clears on
my skin like it just does so after a few
days of being there my skin was
perfectly fine like I went there it's
like a face full of acne and I came back
perfectly fine
so of course not sunny in New York two
weeks after I got back my skin started
getting bad again and I was like oh my
god but I've been using this it's like
it should take like two or three months
to like work and this stuff is really
working right now like knock on wood I
hope that it keeps working it's like
really strong I just want to say like I
don't have sensitive skin like my acne
was like severe it can take like
whatever yeah my skin's like not
sensitive at all like it literally is
like so like rough but I just want to
say like all the medications I've been
through and everything like I I had to
go through so much asking is different
than yours so you really need to like go
to a dermatologist yourself because
they'll know what's best for you this
works for me it's not gonna work for you
like everyone's skin is different
Lucey skin is like really dry and
sensitive which is not mine
whatsoever lets me have opposite skin
tips for like clear skin if you have
acne I would definitely say go to
dermatologists look I know they can be
expensive but she's like talk to your
parents about it because they'll totally
look understand like I said like I
haven't them to make a video in like two
months just because I was so embarrassed
and like it really affects like the way
you feel at least for me I don't know
this is like shallow but like I would be
really upset and like I was like never
in a good mood not all that complained
about it all the time like my friends my
boyfriend probably like so sick of it
I'm like oh my skin so bad boy like it
was just so bad for so long that I just
like couldn't deal with it and I was
like always upset about it I know I have
to put on so much makeup and like it
hurts your face and like it's not it's
not good at all tips really clear skin
if you're struggling with that or if you
just wanna like take good care of your
skin I want to say that I noticed too I
used to be crazy and I like wash my face
like five times a day because in my head
that was making my skin better and like
clearer and it would like clear my acne
but really no it like works in the
opposite direction like it's sharp it's
becoming counterproductive so I realized
that just washing your face once a day
is like the way to go so what I do is I
wash my face with this cleanser which is
like my like I don't even know what to
say like oh it's like life like I love
so much it's um purity by philosophy and
I love it to bits yeah it's from Sephora
and I think it's on the expensive side
but it's like totally worth it like this
stuff like I always squirt at my face do
you remember that haul video if you do I
love you
comment below I scored it this on my
face at home it smells kind of lemony
and like just a natural like it's so
good I love this stuff because it takes
off all my makeup I will show you right
here
works like a charm it makes your face
feels so like clean and like nice
afterwards it takes off everything and
like clears out your pores which is
great it definitely will not irritate
your skin if you like sensitive skin
like it's really gentle and I just use
it once every night and I realize that
like not washing your face in the
morning too is really good like in the
morning I will show you right here in
the morning I just wake up and I just
wash my face with like cold water like I
don't actually wash it I just kind of
rinse it off with cold water to get off
on this stuff it's like acne medication
and like other like eye cream and stuff
so washing my face once a day I think
it's helped a lot because your skin
needs time to kind of like adjust like
if you're watching me constantly it's
just gonna like dry it out now if you
you know something else works for you or
if your dermatologist is telling you to
wash it twice a day by all means this is
just what's worked for me water water
water water water water water is so
important I can't say it enough just
like drinking lots and lots of water
will make your skin a lot shirt like
feel better - like I need to not drink
water at all now I drink like four or
five bottles a day look I'm always
drinking water and like I have more
energy my skin's a lot better
you're not as hungry so you don't like
eat like a pig and eat like a thousand
cupcakes like me so drinking water a lot
I think will help your skin - if you're
like struggling with your skin diet is
like number one if you don't want to
hear like I never want to hear it I was
like I'm gonna go eat my cheese cake
like bye guys look at big deal like if
you were actually struggling with your
skin like trying to eat more fruits and
vegetables you will notice a difference
look diets really big water and I
definitely see them and how it just like
if you have acne and like troubles like
that because they can help you the most
and then just using like a gentle
cleanser at night but if I'm using all
this cleanser on my C then and I'm
washing my face look I've gotta have
moisturizer moisturizer is a really big
deal - and I never used to use it
because I was like you know what no look
I have like oily like acne prone skin
like why do I need moisturizer but like
it's actually a big deal because your
skin will get dry even if it looks oily
like it's dry and a lot of the time I
learned to your skin if you have oily
skin it's because it's so dry from your
like acne medications that like you know
with your body's producing oil because
your skin is actually dry so your skin
may look oily but you really need
it's moisturizer and when ever put a
moisturizer my skin looks oily but I
just deal with it because I know that
I'll need it so these are the two I use
at nighttime I use Cetaphil moisturizing
cream and is it really really thick it
makes your skin look like so oily so I
would not do this during the day at all
unless you get like super dry skin or
something this stuff is like really
thick and like creamy like yeah it's
like cream and my dermatologist
recommended it and I use it some nights
before I put on my acne medication that
stuff the tesseract stuff I just showed
you when I wake up after I rinse my face
off in like towel dry it's actually
pretty dry because with the acne
medication at nighttime so then I use
this stuff which is the Savi
moisturizing lotion and Sarah beans had
a fella I know I recommended by
dermatologists like they're both pretty
good also I don't know when I use it I
just use this like randomly like I just
do whatever I think but I just like
using toner because it makes my face
feel really like clean so sometimes I
just get random ones like I've had like
the cleaning clear like the Neutrogena
like after they all kind of like work
the same unless you'd have like a
favorite this one's like Dickinson's
witch hazel and this stuff actually
works like really really good like I
don't even know it smells kind of funny
though like usually like the Neutrogena
when I know it smells good
this one smells kind of bad but like
whatever um and they just like they
cannot dry out your skin too but they
just make it feel really like tight and
clean and you can get them like anywhere
like the drugstore yeah so I recommend
toner but like you don't really need it
it's just like something extra um yeah I
hope I like said everything I want to
just say I'm sorry this is really boring
a lot of it was just about with my skin
oh but yeah so now after using that
cream which I hope keeps working like
knock on wood that it keeps working
because my skin it is notorious for
getting used to medicine and just
stopping working and also I'm going to
Costa Rican a week so I know that will
make my skin really nice because the Sun
just like makes my skin so nice I'm
wearing makeup but like literally I have
like two pimples on my face with like
concealer and then I just have like
blush and bronzer because yeah my skin's
a lot better than it used to be so if
you have acne like I feel your pain girl
because I've had it for so long my
friends and
and are probably so sick of me like
complaining about it all the time like I
literally control my life and I'd be
like oh my skin so bad look I can't do
anything um but it will get better I
promise
I know it probably feels like it will
and I felt like that for like the last
like three months but finally my skin is
getting better again um so yeah I just
found my everyday makeup routine and
that will be going up soon
and I hope this was helpful in some sort
of way like if you've learned anything
from this just have it be to like eat
better and like drink more water you
actually will notice a difference and I
would say trying like a thousand
different like drugstore stuff at a
point becomes kind of like
counterproductive and you might just
want to go see a dermatologist because
they know it's best and just make sure
you're listening to them because I kind
of was like bad and would like not wear
stuff every night or like not take my
medicine um definitely listen them
because they know what they're doing
like they're getting paid to like be
your doctor basically so then you know
what they're doing
you can like tweet at me and be like my
skin so bad and I'll be like I'm so
sorry like me too but yeah it gets
better and there's always lots of makeup
to cover it up that's what got me
through it I work so much makeup like
crap all over my face but I really don't
like doing that like right now I only
have like powder on cuz I don't need
lotion but thank you so much for
watching and oh also let me let me know
