every day at around 5 o'clock for crew
practice I know that's like a weird time
with those four minutes really make all
the difference I swear now I'm just
brushing my teeth and it is so early
that I can barely keep my eyes open
that's usually how it is every day and I
don't wash my face in the morning I just
rinse it off with cold water because I
found that works the best for me
and yes I really did film this at 5:00
in the morning one day before crew
practice so that's why I'm so sleepy
now I'm just changing into my practice
clothes I will just wear some spandex
and a tank top because that's what I
like to practice in
I will usually throw on my rain jacket
in the morning because sometimes a
little bit colder in the morning and
sometimes it can rain too now I'm just
putting on my shoes and grabbing my hat
and my crew bag with just some stuff
that I need to roll in like socks and
stuff like that
here I'm just grabbing my camel bag to
fill up with some water um I usually
drink my whole camel back during
practice because I love water and it's
really important when you're working out
- this morning I drove to crew practice
usually Lucy and I will switch on and
off and I was just waiting for her to
get in the car we leave around 5:20 and
it takes around 3540 minutes to get to
where we practice so it's a lot of
driving every morning so a lot of times
my twin sister Lucy and I will run and
double we race in that double a lot as
well but today I practice I was rowing
with my best friend Taylor so that's who
you will see in this rowing video I had
a GoPro which I was so thankful I was
able to use is when my friends so that's
what all this rowing footage is from and
this is just like a typical day at
practice I just took some different
parts of our practice and I just thought
some of the footage was really cool so
yeah this is just a lot of me and my
best friend Taylor Rowe
and like I said before water is so so
important so here's me just taking a
water right before we practice some
starts which is right here so that's why
it's only three strokes and then we
glide
and if you didn't notice before it
doesn't really matter what shoes you
wear to run practice because you're just
going to wear the shoes that are in your
boat anyway and if you row you know what
I'm talking about
so that's why I wear flip-flops but I
bring socks so that was just us getting
out of the boat and you carry the boat
on your shoulders so now we are just
bringing it back up to the boathouse
practice is about two hours long but we
don't get out till around 8:15 from
putting on boats away and talking to our
coaches then it takes around 45 minutes
to get home before I have to go to work
I work at two different pools one is
outside by my house and one is the YMCA
so first I will just run home and take a
quick body shower today I was working at
the YMCA so I was just putting on my
uniform and I will read my comments and
watch some Caspar Lee before I have to
go and I know I didn't show myself
eating because I just grabbed a cricket
Nala bar on the ride to the YMCA so that
is a typical summer day morning for me
and thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
