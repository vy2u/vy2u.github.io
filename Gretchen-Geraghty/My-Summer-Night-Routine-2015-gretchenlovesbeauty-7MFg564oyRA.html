summer night routine but right now I'm
just getting home and I'm walking up my
stairs I actually was at the track today
so that's why I'm dressed up all fancy
and I'm going into my closet to change
so I'm showing you my bracelet is from
Kate Spade the other ones Abercrombie my
watch is Michael Kors I know it is
peachy pink color by Orly it's called
pretty to kiss their oohs are out
tsunamis on my other arm and then my
necklace is from Hope boutique and then
my dress is this new one from Urban
Outfitters absolutely love it I love all
those crosses in the back but I just
changed into my ivory Ella long-sleeve
yellow shirt and I'm absolutely obsessed
thank you so much ivory yella it's
perfect I'll have it linked down below I
think it's so cute the blue velvet in my
book I've always wanted it and I'm just
wearing some black Nike shorts and like
I said I was at the track today so just
a really fancy and I had lots of makeup
on so I couldn't wait to take all that
off so heading into the bathroom I'm
first just putting up my hair and a fun
to get out of my face
so I can wash my face and I've been
using it this new face brush that I'm
obsessed with it's called my clarity and
D I've been using it for the past like
week it comes with a deep pore cleanser
and a clarifying serum I love this
because it's just two steps twice a day
you just wash your face and then use the
clarifies here I actually used to wash
my face just once a day but ever since
I've been doing this my skin is
seriously look so clear and they
actually guarantee that your skin will
be clear within 14 days and my totally
totally has and I also just love how
clean the cleanser it makes my skin feel
like it seriously just makes it feel so
clean it gets all my makeup off as you
can see all that black around my eyes is
all I'm a scared coming off they get
your makeup off so well and the serum
makes it so that my pimples stay away
and ones that I have it makes them go
away and that only is gentle and it
doesn't irritate my skin but also it
doesn't have benzoyl peroxide but you're
such a big deal for me because I'm
actually allergic to that and a lot of
face washes actually happens are oxide
which can be a little harsh on your skin
since I love this face wash so much I'm
actually giving away a box to you guys
the boy rules are you messy subscribe to
this YouTube channel Gretchen loves
beauty you miss all my Instagram my
Twitter which is at depressional is big
ngo PYT you must give this video a
thumbs up and you must leave one comment
below suggesting a video idea because
that is how you will be entered so now
I'm just brushing my teeth which is
pretty self-explanatory well you can see
my cute little blue elephant I like my
shirt I think it's so cute okay so now
I'm actually up flossing my teeth and I
don't know if this is like weirdest show
but I wanted this to be as accurate as
possible
I've lost my teeth a lot because I
actually want to be a dentist when I'm
older fun fact
and yeah I'm just kind of great about
that then I put on some chapstick which
was just baby lips and I brushed out my
hair because I actually shower this
morning and then I just go run and jump
into bed because I'm usually is super
tired by now I just took her all into
bed and then I go on my computer
and I really usually respond to some
your comments on my youtube videos for
that's like my favorite thing ever
maybe reply to some business emails and
then sometimes I will start editing
other YouTube videos usually takes me so
long to edit videos then I just go in my
phone check social media text you know
and then that literally was a really on
I am so tired I like never sleep with my
computer away and then I am just pop to
sleep so thank you so much for watching
and I will see you in my next video bye
and good night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
