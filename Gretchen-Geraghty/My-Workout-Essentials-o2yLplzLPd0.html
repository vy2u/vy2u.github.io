exciting video for you and I feel like I
say that in every video but I'm actually
really excited for this video because
you guys always asked me to do like
fitness videos and health related videos
and today I'm just going to be showing
you my workout essentials because I
thought that would be a good idea to
show you what I like to have when I
workout
I have seven essentials on my little
list that I came up with and the first
one I have is a water bottle because
staying hydrated when you work out is
extremely important and my favorite kind
of water bottle that I use when I work
out in is camelbacks because if you're
running it's really easy to just like oh
it's spilling if you're running it's
really easy to just flip up this little
cap and go like that you don't have to
like screw open like a Nalgene you know
so these were my favorite and I covered
it in a bunch like rowing stickers and
that's what the brandy melville one
water bottle is like number one on my
essential list for rowing I was in fear
owing for just working out in general
really
then number two on my workout
essentialist is workout apparel because
you want to make sure that you have the
right clothes workout in definitely not
like jeans I'm pretty sure all of you
know that if you get cute workout a pair
like that will make you even more
motivated to workout that's what I find
myself doing so I like to buy lots of
work out apparel because if I cute we're
going to clothes I just like working out
more so I'll give you an example like
right now I actually just came from my
rowing practice so I'll show you what I
wore today I wore just this on like
pinkish purplish tank top lemon they
have good sports bras - I'm wearing this
like striped one and they have lots of
good workout stuff it's like a little
pricey
but I know like Target has some really
good workout stuff - that's like not is
pricey - yeah just like we're gonna pair
out in general and whoa they're just
these black like Nike ones these are my
favorite kind to workout in because
they're like dry fit in like swishy and
you can like run in them and a good pair
of sneakers is key these ones I don't
like to run in because they don't have
enough support for me and they kinda
like hurt my feet but these ones I will
use to like train in if I'm doing like
weights or strength or like elliptical
that's like not like running and really
like hurts my ankles and such but yeah
these are just like like flying it's
make sure you have good sneakers because
you don't want to injure yourself that
is very important so I like these one
for like cross-training
and these are actually boys if you're
wondering they're not eating girl so if
you don't mind wearing boy sneakers I
guess you can get these two and we can
be twins
then number three on my work at
essentialist is actually this app called
pump up because if you're at home and
you don't know what to do to work out
it's really really helpful and I use it
when I'm at home and I decided I want to
work out look if I don't have access to
going to the gym if it's like too late
to go to the gym or if it's a day that
I'm off of rolling practice I'll use
pump up this is just a positive and like
inspiring community everyone's pictures
on there are so helpful they show like
their transformations and it's just
really interesting to see other people
and I like motivates you to like here
I'll show you mine and this is just like
people I follow and yeah they have like
really cool transformation pictures like
look at you can see like how much weight
those girls lost and you can see like
different food ideas and it's cool
because you can show like a healthy
recipe or you control like workout gear
or like running outside there's a lot of
different health-related things on here
so I'll show you I'll post a picture
right now after my workout there's a
picture of me in my shorts in my room so
you just click share a photo like I just
did and then you're just gonna go
through your camera roll and find one
you want alright so here's a picture of
me in my shorts like I wanted and yeah
it's just gonna be me showing my shorts
after practice so I can write like post
practice just like that done save a
floating photo and now you can see it on
my feed and you can even get out your
phone right now while I babble on and
download this my username is gr Garrety
here's just some pictures that I put up
and you should totally follow me because
like I said it's a super cool way to
just stay inspired and motivated to work
out
my next workout essential is actually
nutrition related it's actually just
protein in protein in general because
you want to make sure you're feeling
your body in the right way and so
sometimes I'll just grab a granola bar
like a half-an-hour before practice or
right after if I'm really hungry and
it's just a good way to make sure that
you're feeling your body in the
healthiest ways and that you're not
going to go home and eat a bunch of
brownies because that's no good
then my fifth workout essential is
actually just music and I like to use my
phone and just go on my iPod or
sometimes like Spotify if I'm feeling
fancy and I just use my earbuds and I
definitely definitely definitely have to
listen to music when I run because or
else I get too bored so yeah music is
definitely an essential it's literally
so boring if you don't use music
then six and seven for my workout
essentials are actually related they're
sunglasses and hats because when you're
rowing on the water and it's really
sunny you got to like protect your skin
obviously like from the Sun and your
eyes mainly so that you can see in row
well so I actually just got a new pair
of these black Oakley's and they will be
shown in upcoming haul video
but having sunglasses if you're doing
sports that are outside are really
important to protect your eyes so you
want to make sure you get polarized
lenses like these ones and Oakley just
has like a lot of different variety and
good ones that can like really stay on
your head picked out these ones because
they're rubbery and they like stay on my
head so they don't move and I'm like
moving around and I'm rolling in case
you're wondering they're like the flak
2.0 ones and I got the like XL lenses
and I just got all like matte black
anyways
sunglasses are definitely an essential
when I'm out on the water because you
want to protect your eyes and it helps
with glare on the water as well then my
very last one is a hat and I actually
used to row and hats like every single
day and now I just use them once in a
while if my hair is like blowing in my
face if it's really windy or if I don't
have my sunglasses and a lot of times I
will wear my sunglasses and my hat
together just if it's really sunny and
the same thing these just protect your
eyes from the Sun and also help protect
your skin from the Sun because the Sun
can be really damaging to your skin and
everything so a hat is my last essential
so yeah those were all my workout
essentials and I'm wondering what you
guys workout essentials are definitely
leave them down below in the comments so
I can see what you have to say hey hair
tie is another one you got to pull back
your hair but um
yeah leave down below in the comments
some of your workout essentials because
I'm super curious to see what your
workout essentials are and yeah thank
you so much for watching and I will see
you in my next video bye before watching
