really quick um today is my 1 year on
YouTube
officially which is so so insane to me
like I remember just a year ago April
first
I um I was talking my friend Hannah who
got me the whole YouTube thing and I was
like I wanna make youtube videos it
looks like so much fun and she's like
she was she's really too scared to like
she won't even do it now um and I was
like you know what I'm just gonna do it
and she sat on my bed and watched me and
I was playing with my macbook and I was
sitting on the ground in front of my bed
and I was just like putting on a bunch
of makeup and it was called like my
everyday makeup routine but it really
wasn't cuz I didn't even wear makeup
back then I just wore like powder if
anything and maybe like mascara um and I
was putting on all this makeup and I
didn't even know what I was doing
and that was my first video in YouTube
and I was way too shy to even like talk
to the camera I was so nervous I would
just sit there and I'd be like so and I
can't believe that was so far ago like a
year ago
look it feels like it was yesterday
really um but yeah this is just all so
crazy to me and YouTube has been like
wow like amazing like it's brought me
some really cool opportunities and I'm
going to I hats this weekend and I'm
going to meet a bunch of you for the
first time I've never met any of my
subscribers any of you so that should be
a blast I'm so much fun um but I really
wanted to thank you all for sticking
with me for this whole year and if
you've been watching me from the
beginning
you know just how awkward off I started
like even now I'm still a weirdo okay
but back then I was like I really didn't
even know what I was doing still now
like I barely barely know I'm not an
expert whatsoever um but thank you so
much for like staying with me through my
journey um you've definitely seen me
grown up a bit in this last year I
believe um like if any of you have
watched my earlier videos you know what
I mean
I mean I was just kind of shy and now
YouTube has made me like way more
outgoing and confident with myself not
even like it's helped me in ways that I
didn't even think it would like I have
way more self-confidence when people
start finding out about my channel I
thought I would be so scared but really
I don't even care because it's something
that I like doing and it makes me really
confident and I'm proud of the videos I
make I'm proud of my channel so if
people have problem with that it really
doesn't bother at me like I thought it
would um because YouTube is just made me
so so more confident like the nice
comments you guys leave like when you
guys message mean I know I'm I'm helping
you and I can message you back and I'm
like helping you individually and
personally that just makes me so happy
and I feel so good when I can personally
talk to you guys so um yeah I just
really like thank you so much I know I
have like almost 7000 subscribers which
is literally mind-boggling like it's
crazy to me I remember I never thought
I'd get to 100 subscribers and then I
did I think I started crying like I was
like oh my gosh 100 people watch me at
my videos and stuff and now I have like
thousands which is like what so um oh my
gosh thank you again so much for
everything like it's all because of you
like I'm where I am right now because of
