pool just reading magazines and books
you know it's a rough life I really hate
my job and I just thought I would vlog
today because I'm getting my hair done
later and then later Lucy and me and
Julia and Emily are getting Chipotle so
I thought that would be fun
oh yeah and ice cream don't forget the
ice cream Wow can't believe I forgot
about that
whoa pretty crucial I know and I don't
know why people seem to like my blog so
much like I feel like videos hydrants
how much variance mine's pretty boring
no it's literally no for real though
like it's just like basic stuff I do
like during the day and then videos are
gonna plan out and I'm like this is neat
so many views like I I'm gonna try so
hard no one watched it I could you know
be in a featured in a video okay
my dog is so you can tell her on your
phone when you're at home and I can put
it in oh my god yes Julia went hiking
for five weeks
so we're stomach's really paler than the
rest of her all 46 yeah that's a good
accomplishment
how do out on my resumes all right guys
look at how cute Julia's dog is she's
literally soaked wait she's a mix right
that's like that right wild German
Shepherd custome shirts mugs a
Rottweiler just cuz like her color but
she's like the shape of the German yeah
hopefully you'll see a video of your
after this
this is Juno the little baby they hide
you'll be fans
they're actually terrible also two guys
I got really lucky because I left my
house I was scared I was gonna be late
but I got here like just on time because
I didn't have any red lights like the
world was just knowing that I had to get
my hair done you know that I'm gonna get
some highlights in low-light and yeah
I'm really excited my hair's been
getting along too
I really don't want to get a cut because
now it's like boo bling we will see how
it goes oh well guys if someone walks in
here while I'm vlogging I'm gonna be
really embarrassed
my hairdresser Jill was telling me that
the owner here actually has two
daughters that watch my videos and
they're really sad because they're on
vacation right now I'm getting my hair
done so they couldn't come see me so hi
Jillian and Taylor I'm so happy you
watched my videos and yeah tell your mom
I love her salon and hopefully it next
time I come I'll be able to meet you
guys so yeah this is really funny right
now that I'm learning okay I have my
highlights my lights in I guess you'll
see how it looks after guys 2% and I'm
just getting into my car I actually got
two of these wet brushes and I've heard
about them before and they're supposed
to be better to brush your hair when
it's wet like less damaging and I always
brush my hair and it's wet so I got a
pink one and it comes with a little blue
one and then I got a darker pink one
with a purple one to either get sick
Lucy or my mom or whatever and I thought
that'd be handy and look at no more
roots happy Gretchen so my phone dies
sorry um I'm gonna still try to vlog at
the mall and at Chipotle and at I wish
she would call it cold stone of course
with Julia and Emily and Lucy but also
again I don't know if you could hear me
before because it was kind of quiet in
there but hi Jillian and Taylor and yeah
what's up I hope I see you next time I'm
in there getting my hair done you guys
Joe's the best and I'm sure your mom is
too yeah so I love my hair now I'm just
in a really happy mood and if you guys
are wondering when I get I know I said
it before but I just get like a full
head of highlights and a little
because I have my hair is naturally like
I don't know if you can tell it's kind
of like a like darker brown color like
you can kind of see in some spots I
guess I'm not dark brown it's kinda like
a medium brown but I get some lowlights
thrown in there because my hair has
gotten so blonde just from getting hats
for such a long time but so yeah I just
get some highlights and lowlights really
happy the way it turned out is I have to
go now because Lucy and my friends are
waiting for me at the mall I'm so happy
I'm going to get my MacBook Air now and
I need to say before but I really did
get it cut a little bit yeah they're
really hungry and I'm making them come
with me to get back up look it's my home
that's where I live Lucy split the call
we're all doomed
I'm gonna get a car today
no Beauty because it on the therm you
see
well I just drove Emily I didn't kill
her so I'd say it's not as successful
though oh they're trying to leave okay
everyone finally I'm so hungry airing
out my computer woohoo
do you have cash yes put the pole get
holy crying listen I just lit that pole
we're doomed
okay if you're twins it doesn't count
we're making that rule right now because
Justin taught me
Jefferson taught me that it just may be
some other poll it's just really bad
it's like superstitious looking you just
like don't do it you know you don't like
walking or a ladder
or like cross some black cat like that
kind of thing or like open umbrella is a
pool I mean these order that Pulido but
I think it may get a bowl I don't like
cheese I think I get the best bowl no
cheese for me basically we're so happy I
can't let my console running it has 1%
okay everyone good for you on YouTube

diet or vodka Julius this is my bowl I
get white rice chicken black beans corn
salsa and cheese and then chip the guac

thing I get every time I come here it's

today my vegetables go sometime buddy
that and I get corporal the entire cream
and let it slip hands baby cries make
you look at Julian I got Birds on the
direct sunlight or four hours with no
substrate the hottest parts today
today I learned something new about GLB
are you friend very superstitious
oh no I'm not yes you are yes you are
they're splitting poles left and right
like no that's not what you want and why
no something else really embarrassing
Lucy was going um Lucy was going to
throw out her trash at Chipotle so I
followed her and I thought Joey and
Emily were behind me but they weren't
and then it was funny because Lucy's
phone was poking out over the back of
her pocket cuz there's holes in her
jeans and then I should know I was like
God look at Lizzie's mom but then they
weren't there cuz they went to a
different trashcan so then I was just
talking to the whole Chipotle restaurant
and it was really bear saying and then
they probably thought I didn't have any
friends which like I guess really anyway
how many of my things does not like tan
and when the hair doesn't know it looks
Beautif and I want my face to be the
color of your face oh my god I remember
talking at the pool with you and you're
like Julia's stomach is so white
I couldn't tell I was like her stomach
is evidence now red as a light is okay
and headed to a cold stone okay we'll
report back later
Oriol I'm just cuz no I'm just being you
did Shana Warner boys Julia oh hey Julia
got coffee with heath bar Emily got
pretzel me too Lucy up peanut butter
what's over now yeah I'm gonna chocolate
I got Oreo overload but at bat so I
added brownies okay everything things at
the top that's so true there's so much
brownies and cookies are the top of this
yeah now we're happy here oh wait
singing Emily hey guys
this is a future Olympian in rowing
right here when emily is in the Olympics
I wanna be like I knew her by the way
Lucy meet rode with Emily and Julia so
we're gonna like miss them so much in
college and yeah I'm just gonna miss him
a lot
yeah so I did get a little cut off my
hair and because I just had the chance
to look at it so I thought I would just
like you know throw this in here and I
did get like a tiny bit cut off cuz my
hairdresser has gone to jail she
understands me so when we got like
probably a half an inch cut off and so
you can't even really tell which I'm
happy about cuz I hope my hair to be
long again and ya see the the top is all
born so I'm happy
it's very blonde and I like it I think
when I got lowlights before I kind of
got more little it's like it was kind of
more more the brown with the blonde but
I still like it like this like I like
being one that's clearly why I'm blonde
and I'm really happy that I got my
MacBook Air and there's white beets in
here
unboxing yeah so they give you white
beets if you're like a student it's a
good promotion let's look at this puppy
always heavy and this thingy - what's
actually not heavy just the boxes but um
yes I'm super happy I got that I don't
know if I explained it before but I'm
going to use this one
which is just my MacBook Pro I'm gonna
use that I'm more like editing like you
to kind of stuff like I'll leave that
like in my room like my college dorm
room but then I'll use my air for like
to actually take two classes and like do
notes on it stuff because it's like
smaller and I'll just be easier to have
like school on one computer and like
YouTube on the other one so yeah because
sometimes my MacBook Pro well um get
like full at the memory cuz I like so
many videos so I've actually I just
delete a lot of videos but I don't want
to have to delete them you know and it
can go slower when I have like ten apps
like running at once so I'll just be
easier to have like two different
computers and yeah so I'm happy I made
that decision and I'm happy I'm able to
like support myself financially with
those kind of things that I want in need
because in YouTube but it's not because
of you guys so thank you so much and
also too I thought I would just throw
this thought out there everyone has been
telling me recently that I really should
have a vlog Channel and I thought about
that for a while like I really started
vlogging when I started with vlog missus
past December so I almost heard about
channel back then but then I was like oh
no like I read at my youtube channel for
three years like it's kind of too late
to start a vlog channel but I don't know
what do you guys think because it is
kind of annoying like when I post a
video like every single day on this
channel if you might even miss some cuz
I've been posting one like every day
because of my normal videos and my vlogs
so I'm kind of thinking I can make
another channel like what do you guys
think can you leave your comments down
below if you think I should make another
blog channel or not would that be like
helpful good I don't know maybe I'll
just start a new vlog channel when I
start blog missus December so I don't
know we'll see it was really fun
lifeguarding and then getting my hair
done I was licking my hair down and
talking to Jill she's really nice and
then going to chip away and getting the
ice cream of course that was obviously
the highlight of my day so thank you so
much for watching and I'll see you my
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
