then I found all these like egg salad
and chicken salad pasta salads in
tabbouleh and how this is actually so
good you guys need to try it you would
like it to bullies just like like
tomatoes and like I forget it's like it
oh yeah we already booked up too but
then we decided that we'd none of us
want sweet green took a lot of salad and
I'm not that hungry done on a salad mood
so I got all these random things with
the lavash bread which reminds me of
Hannah did you know Hannah Valesky when
we were growing up had like only house
with another house like they had you
know unhealthy food yeah we do booby was
like yeah she would come ask me and I'll
be clean that lunch we like trade and
stuff cause she'd only have in like the
lavash I learned from her she'd only
have like a lavash bread they like
didn't even have Oreos she would always
put our husband Ian oh I got this juice
by the way which I was really scared of
so I never tried before I just thought I
needed something to heal me but as I
think I'm getting sick I always am and
it suja fermented botanicals honeydew

blog okay update the night answer no um
so first of all everyone Lisa I thought
that you were kidding when you were
saying on it wasn't working to try to
prank us into thinking that we changed
it we didn't change your pants long
story short
Louisa's Pascoe just stopped working and
all of you guys are being super helpful
and we're like suggesting things we do
but we actually tried everything but
going on iTunes like resetting it like
we talked to a girl from Apple and there
was like nothing that she could do she's
like sorry you forgot your password
bleak losses like I didn't forget it
just stopped working like it's always
been her password I simply to her yeah
yeah all our doors are shut and then so
that sucks and then Louisa had a little
cry because Lee on the counter you think
yeah so she just delete everything so
she could factory reset your phone this
is happening Hanna saw am a coast which
is everyone and we were all screaming
and like it was a movie it was scary
20 miles dress yeah so it's I am going
to die because I'm you and yeah we're
turning this into a silver lining though
because we need ice cream yeah cudoce
Felix first perfect okay so we're gonna
split up

well it'll be nice but the scary thing
is you know if we catch of my a mouse I
mice am I not alone
someone yeah but like when there's one
there's 20 that's my dad told me so
we're scared as heck and the people were
subletting for him so that they never
saw a mouse ever so basically we're bad
luck I don't know I just feel like we
haven't seen them but they've been there
you know yeah because I'm always scared
of mice literally last night I dropped a
press on the ground and he goes pick it
up or else we're getting it money okay
and we have been kinda bad with leaving
food out but not that bad like it could
have been a lot worse all year and
