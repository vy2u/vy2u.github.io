finally I going to be my apartment to
air and in New York City this summer
I've been wanting to film this apartment
to our awesome or long but realistically
our apartment has never been clean
enough for me to film it and honestly it
would have been a better idea to film I
did beginning in the summer before we
got everything really dirty if that
makes any sense
we're not like in the NYU dorms here in
New York City but it is like a dorm
setup because we're in this place that's
well I guess I can even say what it is
because this is going up after I move
out anyway we were living in the Cooper
Square residence and only live here if
you're in college and then intern and me
and my three roommates that live here
they're all my friends from VA we're all
interns and you guys know I'm interning
for dope shopping so I just work
remotely
since service in San Francisco but
pretty much everyone else that lives
here works in Manhattan sends its intern
housing that's why it does look like a
dorm and it's kind of set up like a dorm
it's pretty nice and it worked out
perfectly we love it we love our area
and yeah without further ado let's get
on into it it's when you come in to me
and Addie's room my naty's room Maddie's
in my room Addie is my roommate she is
at work right now and Sam our other
roommate is at work Kerrigan is also our
other roommate but she actually already
went home and moved out Addie's and
Alfie with me she's my pledge class and
we didn't know each other that well
before we lived together this summer but
it worked out perfectly I love her so
much so yeah this is our cute little
setup and this is my side as you can
probably recognize if you've noticed
this stuff from my dorm room tour this
is just what everything looks like I
don't know if I'm going to go through
and say where everything's from my Alfie
vlog is you can notice it's kind of like
bunched up on the sides because it
didn't fit perfectly anywhere but I just
got that from big.little for my big
Natalie and then this is from society6
this is just a spree blanket I got for
college I mean know where it's from but
it's really pretty nice this to Bay
cover my roommates say I'm actually said
it was really soft I never have noted
that it was so soft and she was like
it's the best way to fake cover I need
it and it's literally like probably 15
bucks from Target and I just got some
pillows I got this fluffy pillow I'm
wearing out this at Pottery Barn forever
ago because I wanted it so bad this is
literally from like Walmart but I love
it she says gee obviously for Gretchen
and my last name Garrity too I guess
and then Charlie my little pillow of it
so that is what my bed looks like oh
also I have a headboard which is so
great people always ask me about this
this company called you bored actually
shout to me maybe like a year ago I
think before my sophomore year at BU and
they're like hey wanna head board for
college and I was like uh yah who else
hates when they're like pillows fall
behind their bed like I hate it so
that's that and then we have these
little dressers that we got that go
underneath of our beds and I literally
have an extension cord right there that
I plug my computer and my phone into
because I'm too lazy to like plug them
in where there's actual plugs here's my
phone here's my little desk area feel
this is so unorganized the order I'm
going in and this is literally the
cleanest my desk has been all summer and
it's really not that clean like I
haven't been able to see this the whole
time I've lived here no kidding but this
is just my little swell water bottle
I've got going on we I didn't even
finish over here I'm a wreck I'm really
a wreck sorry our air conditioner is
really loud too it's really strong it
blows like freezing cold air yeah and I
can show you a little view of Cooper
Square over there are windows look like
durty I'm sorry we literally are a mess
me daddy
oh you say that we live in our own filth
it's like 5:00 p.m. right now so just a
chill day I love our view it's really
cute and then my lamp is from Pottery
Barn Teen I believe I don't even know
what's in that bag and here's my hydro
Flast my day one oh gee love that guy
and then I literally have random stuff
in there so we're not I'm gonna go in
there and then back there I have an
extra pillow in all of my shoes I
literally like toss them over my
headboard yeah and then how cute is a
Dee's bed I love it her duvet cover is
so pretty I know it's from urban cuz I
told her that I loved it and I was with
it and then our pillows are really cute
- I don't even know where those are from
so she's from Arizona so she had to get
all of this like once she got here and
then she just has some 80 letters right
there oh yeah and so you'll notice like
since salmon Carrigan and addy ala to
fly here
Sam's from Utah Carrigan's from San
Francisco a DS from Arizona so obviously
so far so they to like get all their
stuff once they got here and meanwhile I
have like carloads full of stuff cuz I
just drive like three hours from my
house you know oh and then this rug I
got sent to me which was so nice
it's from rugs USA and I'm a professor
that I got it this summer for like me
and addy to have obviously but then I
know I'm gonna have it in my room this
coming year at BU for my junior year and
back to my desk
smell water bottles some makeup these
are just the meds I have to dig right
now because I just got a tooth pulled
because I cracked my tooth on a
pop and the root so there like it has to
come out so I'll just cut a tooth fold
it's like getting like your wisdom teeth
out it was horrible so I'm taking what
am I taking like amoxicillin some
ibuprofen there's like a naked smoky
palette my favorite dry shampoo ever go
get it from dry bar me and Kerrigan are
obsessed especially if you're blonde
like it kind of like makes your roots
look less Brown so it's just the best I
have some bumble bumble stuff every day
why am I going through everything like
you can just see with your own two eyes
some body butter Mikey and are you guys
like me like everyone makes fun of me
and says that I'm like college freshmen
because I have this lanyard but I like
need a lanyard or I lose my keys I got
so much stuff from the container so
early in the summer I should I got a new
one of these because acrylic like drawer
thing is obviously getting so girls I
like taped it once and yet never came
out but with his chapstick I just got
from urban love it it smells really good
I don't know like what flavor it is but
yeah you know do you love that oh these
aren't even my sunglasses my friend
Molly left him here this is my new baby
my new camera Canon what is it oh yeah
7dd and people keep saying that it's
like focusing and my haul videos and
stuff so I just got to turn it off of
autofocus because you can hear it's like
click click click you know it like makes
clicking noise it sorry about that and
that's why I'm just filming with my blog
came right now so that I wasn't using
that no big click a click and it would
bother people you know memory card
battery charger oh there is my David
Yurman necklace I didn't know if it was
it's just inside of whispers like oh my
hermes bracelet I got really in the
summer Mario Badescu face spray it's
like the Rose spray good stuff highly
recommend I don't even think this is my
watch maybe it is I think we'll see able
to hear my little Bose speaker Mario
Badescu drying lotion love that stuff
more body butter and this is my favorite
hair stuff ever it's called pillow proof
blow dry express treatment primer best
ever I always use this when I blow dry
my hair it makes your hair get
blow-dried it makes it like dry really
quick and it smells good it protects
your hair I literally couldn't find it
anywhere so I had to like find it on
Amazon if I can find it I'll link it
down below because it's my fave this is
like low-key a favorites video I like
running to things and be like this is my
favorite and then this area of our floor
is always filled with stuff so this is
very rare that it looks like this and
it's still like not clean as you can see
I'm running sneakers for when I try to
work out my yoga mat there's a go little
roller back there
my backpack in this bin that I usually
throw right I'm closing another bin for
random clothes but right now it has
these SoulCycle shoes that I got
yesterday and I'm so excited about I use
them for the first time yesterday but I
just throw them back in this box highly
recommend getting your own because what
I realized from going to SoulCycle all
the time this summer in the city is that
like everyone obviously that rents them
uses the same ones over and over and
over and I started to feel really gross
so then I just bought my own I don't
even know what's in that Urban
Outfitters bag tripod obviously roller
and I need use the spiky ones because
the normal is just don't work on me like
I don't know why my quads and my calves
get like so tight so I need to use that
one I got a clothing rack for school
this year everything container store so
it's just chilling back there
oh my ring lights down there for when I
thought and since I work from home this
is what I look like all day and this
mirror is so gross I'm really sorry like
we're gross okay we're like 20 year old
college kids like we don't really
prioritize cleaning but this is our only
like full-length mirror here so everyone
comes here to try and close these are
our little closets that came with the
place and the first day I got here I was
like oh no this is not gonna work but
somehow I made it work you can't really
like move hangers because it's all
shoved in there but yep there's my
clothes I don't even know what's down
there
sweatshirts oh and q-tips and philosophy
nice because I need that was own an
umbrella and a lint thing like that's so
random to have them there I don't know
I'm weird then I have these like what
are all these different Kate Spade
they're like these boxes with hair tools
and stuff in them but what's funny is
when I show you our bathroom you'll see
there's like a blow-dryer like a hair
dryer and a flat iron that have been one
of our roommates that have been in there
since day one and we all just use those
addy has a towel is her little closet
addy when you're watching this love you
my roommates message to you you knew
this was coming I told you I was filming
I didn't tell you exactly when so I tied
it up a bit but I'm sorry if your stuff
is messy and you're mad at me so we're
just gonna like go through addy site
really quick okay usually I have clothes
like that everywhere and yeah that's
just like realistically how it's gonna
be
but her desk I tried it up a bit she has
her little computer I love this a fee
sticker - so cute and I love her little
bins up there that was a really good
idea that's really cute but the fact
that I'm leaving on Sunday makes me
shows that or another thing I like is
that our ceilings are really high so it
makes it like look more open
begin stuff okay moving out to the
kitchen so this is our kitchen
in typical New York fashion very small
what's nice is we actually have two
fridges there's our mini fridge and then
our other big fridge is right there and
there's only no room to put our pot in
our pan so we just like leave them out
that goes in the toaster oh my gosh
Cratchit and I'm so mad at myself I was
gonna put these all the way before from
the video but you know what it's just
real life guys there's some utensils and
stuff I did do the dishes but then I
left them drawing so that was a fail I
don't even know what's under there stuff
it's probably not that clean should I
show you oh yeah my blender some other
kitchen stuff I'm like really nervous
opening all these cabinets we really
don't have that much food because we
pretty much eat out every meal I know
that's really bad then I think Sami has
some more food up there yup microwave so
that's really nice honestly okay
obviously our kitchen isn't huge right
it's like a little kitchenette but like
it works like we don't need much more
than that you feel me so my daddy's room
am I saying that right
Addie's in my room and then it goes
Carrigan's and Sam's room and like I
said Carrigan moved out the other day
she went back to San Francisco
for the rest of the summer but what I
love about their room like honestly I
was jealous that they got this room and
we got the other one because I love that
their wall is just all windows I think
it's so nice and like so bright in here
and obviously it's such a cute view it's
so cool that we can finally tell you
where we actually live haha when you
come into the room they have their two
little desks that's Carrigan's desks but
she just left a bunch of stuff here that
she didn't want anymore cause she had to
go home Sam's desk and then I love that
they pushed their two beds together
because it's really fun so we'll just
like all like hang out on them and then
it just makes like a really big floor
area right here for us to like dance I
think it came like this bed was
initially there and then there was a
desk there and then there was a bed
right here like this way and then the
other desk was like there I think and
then they put their two little wardrobe
closets together I'm gonna go in there
cuz I already showed you a DS in mine
and then they put their dressers on top
of each other which I thought was so
smart to conserve space but then I
realized you can't even see what's up
here because we're too short and I'm
five nine so I don't know how anyone can
hit up there obviously like I said
there's less like decorations and stuff
because they all
why here and buy everything here once
they got here you know so this is their
room camera battery died I've since put
on shorts just did some laundry so where
were we showed you my daddy's room
showed you our little kitchen
Sam's home dude like did someone get
hired to clean our apartment I know and
some people are gonna probably be like
it's not even that clean it's gross and
like this is so clean from it's just
hard like for people in these floors
they get dirty so easily and control
girls yes with long hair I was just
saying hair gets everywhere so this is
when you walk in this is what it looks
like
we just have trash bags right there like
they're normal plastic bags we just use
them for trash and then this is like
kind of random it used to be cute but
there's like bowls and more bowls these
are people's I got them from Norma 5ms
friend because people always ask and
these are really cute little jars with
like smoothie Bowl stuff we have coconut
chia seeds and Counting even know what
else is in that there's little vacuum I
was using earlier some clark's wipes I
was using those are little appellee
snack things I don't even know we had a
fire extinguisher
Wow so prepared we have a phone I've
never seen this Oh keeping a quick
thought there'd be a dial tone I'm like
I didn't know they gave his phone okay
never mind
and then this rug I don't even know how
it got over here it used to be over
there but now it's here
oh okay we use it as a stat one that's
really funny okay and then Adi suitcase
is there I don't know why it's there it
used to be in there or whatever and then
here's our big fridge I don't even know
what's in here we don't really have that
much food because we like eat out a lot
so yeah and then our freezer and then
there is random stuff up there I think I
got this cereal like the day I moved in
so it's probably really old then our
bathroom which isn't the cleanest it
could be but you know it's cleaner than
it has been here's our low sink there's
a straightener and hair dryer that we've
all been using like all summer and we
don't even know whose it is whose is it
Sam is it yours
oh really I'm like we don't even know
whose they are we just all use them and
then oh this opens actually we have on
toothbrushes and stuff like that in
there and then more stuff like that over
there
this is this like Sigma lip sticky lip
Kranthi when I got the other day who's
in my makeup bag and the top fell off
and it turned everything pink and I just
left it there
I should probably throw that I this is
someone's lotion there's my hairbrush
toilet paper toilet trashcan scale oh my
gosh probably should use that I haven't
use a dulcimer and it's okay then I got
this little rug that says get naked from
Urban Outfitters I think it's so cute I
love it used to be a lot cleaner but
we've used it all summer so yeah I'll
definitely bring this to my apartment in
the fall at BU because it's really cute
and then our showers actually super nice
but we just don't really clean it them
on just so it's probably not that clean
and there's the bathroom I think that is
everything guys so it's like little
kitchen for your area Sam and Carrigan's
room and then me Nadya's rooms so yeah I
think that is it for my New York City
apartment tour I've been wanting to
share with you guys for a while
obviously not huge but like there's only
four of us or 20 year old college kids
like we don't need that much space
thank you guys so much for watching this
video and I'll see ya next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
