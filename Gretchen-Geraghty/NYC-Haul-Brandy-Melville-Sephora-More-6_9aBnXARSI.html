York City I went over the past weekend
and I had such fun time I went with my
cousin in my aunt and Lucy my twin
sister we had so much fun we did a lot
of fun shopping that I couldn't have
done here some of you may know that I
went to New York City because I put that
picture of me and my sister up on
Instagram in front of the tree so if you
don't follow me on instagram definitely
follow me at cochin loves beauty and
you'll be like further updated with Milo
in my last video i said i would put up a
picture of the boots of our three
trooper boots and I never did and some
people were like ask him at it so it'll
go right here I promise right now
and then I'm filming with my new tripod
that i got for christmas so i'm in my
room actually you guys are probably so
confused because I go all over the place
when I'm filming um sometimes I'm in my
sister's loft and sometimes i'm just in
her room and right now in my room so
like my Christmas lights and I'm sitting
in my bed so without further ado let's
just get into the hall video the first
place we went to is actually support and
there's a few things that I knew I
wanted to buy so first I got the dior
addict to life perfume oh my goodness
this is my favorite scent ever I don't
think I've ever heard anyone talk about
it ever I've never even heard of it just
over the summer I got a little sample
because you know like support will give
you samples when you buy stuff and I
fell in love with it like I use that
sample to attend because it's like my
favorite scent ever so I just got um I
think it's the 1.7 fluid ounce of your
attic to life and Yap action is cute not
that that matters but oh my gosh it's
just my favorite smell ever like it
smells so good look next time you go to
Sephora any way that they have this go
into all this perfume because I promise
you love it and then the next review i
got is dolce gabbana light blue now I
have loved this perfume for so long aunt
slow long so long and all my friends
will just get it all ready cuz I always
talk about how much I love it no my
friend Kathleen actually just got me on
the little like roller ball but it's
actually good spray and so I'm gonna
keep me that with me like everywhere
obviously like those with me and all of
my bags and like it'll go with me school
too but now I just have this one and
this isn't even that big either it's
just the point 8 fluid ounces and but
yeah yeah as you can see like obviously
it's like not that big but oh this will
last me forever and this also smells so
good oh my gosh they both smell amazing
and i actually realized they kind of
smell
similar so that's probably why I like
them so much the guy was smelling them
one after another and then I was like
you know you smell oh but I got the
naked Urban Decay basic and it has all
of those colors foxy walk of shame naked
to faint and crazy see how little this
is it's so cute in comparison to the
naked one in naked too it's I think
about like half the size of those it's
just those pretty color definitely love
this and we do all the time um I'm
actually wearing it on my eyes right now
so if you guys want a tutorial for this
just comment below then I'll probably do
I next video the tutorial where this
path shadow using the Naked urban decay
basics huh and then oh and then I feel
like I've been a vib at sephora for a
long time now but they just gave me this
thing you just like put it in my bag I
don't really know and it came with um it
came with like three little cards and i
already put them in my wallet so i have
him but like it opened up like this i
had a Cartier Cartier Cartier and then
right here we actually get it pretty
cool the mirror that game there says vib
beauty insider sephora viously just a
mirror but wow that's like glare in your
face okay so they just gave me that
which was pretty cool and then the three
cards say like I can have like free
shipping ten percent off my next
purchase and then the other card I'm so
excited to use it's like um go to your
Sephora store and they give you a free
like makeover which is actually yeah i'm
so excited teasy so i'll definitely be
doing that oh my gosh we're so excited
to put a brandy melville because um we
don't act well I don't have a brandy
melville like around where I live I've
only ever ordered online so you're so
excited to another store because I've
never actually been to a granola store
and as I said it was raining to look at
how beat up this baguette
it crunched around but that was kind of
sad look at the bags just like a paper
bag i wish you sound like pretty novel
and I could let keep it forever but
anything else i got this sweater and
it's black and tan strips and it's
really cool because um it's really tight
on the arms but then it's like baggy
right here so i don't know it looks
really cool on and of course like all of
their closest like super stretchy their
stuff is one size fits all but yeah
super super super cute and i really love
that and then I got this tank top that
actually saw online and I was so excited
because they had it and it's just this
black tank top I think the cut is called
Sadie for reference if you're wondering
and it says amazing baby in the school
like print oh and it's okay it's out
think it's supposed to be cropped but I
me kind of is because I have such a long
torso so and you could call it a crop
top but for most of you probably won't
be I don't know it in between medium but
super cute and I really love that I'm
gonna bring that all pad actually I
already don't wear that with which is
this will be onto necessary clothing
we're going to keep this bad news topic
okay I got this green army jacket I have
been looking for a green with long army
jacket for like thing ever because I
think they're so cute and I just got
this one the only thing about this is
it's not that dark like it's kind of
like a lighter dark green that makes
sense but um I still really love it and
it's like the cutting boards like long
and get straight hair in the middle and
has like buttons and this is just super
cute and i already know i'm gonna wear
it with this amazing baby tank
underneath so that will be coming up in
a fit of the week so a nice thing is
this great pea coat and it's just um
like short i don't know if i can you
tell um it's not like long with my other
two because i have i have a white one in
a black one and I longer like they go
down past my
but this one's short and so yeah I
really like that and it's just gray
really bad at like holding up so you
can't really tell but it has like the
collar and also has a hood which neither
of my pea coats are now do so i doing
that's really cute and i really like it
and then i guess i'll just throw in some
of the stuff i got at the drugstore um i
had to get this oil free acne wash by
neutrogena because my dermatologist
recommended this face wash to me um so
yeah I'm seeing a dermatologist because
I'm just having so much issues with my
skin and I actually saw her like a month
ago but I've supposed to been using and
I haven't been so I just picked that up
and then I wanted a new mascara so I got
the L'Oreal telescopic carbon black and
I've heard such great things about this
miss Kelly Marie 16 love you girl he
said that this is like your favorite
ever so I went and I bought it because
of you and I'm so excited to try this
out and then I just picked up this
burt's bees or punishing lip balm with
pomegranate oil and i really like it
like it smells it smells like burpees
you know what that smell but then it's
like it smells good too with hunger it's
kind of like and it makes your lips have
it's actually like the color of my
natural lips but like no I think it's so
pretty H&amp;amp;M and I got a tank top and it's
just white and really long so this is me
so cute by glaring and I'm gonna put it
underneath either that jacket or like a
long cardigan and to look so cute like
leggings and boots and yeah I really
like that and then okay this I think
looks so ugly like when you hold it up
like when I saw it I was like ill then I
just started to like whatever with the
heck tried on and it looks so cute on
its this um kind of cream blouse with
pink with detailing around it
only now but um it looks so cute on its
like quarter sleeves and the buttons are
buttoned but I has like buttons are
there and also in the back there's like
a button and yeah that's just really
keaton at american eagle i got this huge
huge thing and my cousin thinks it's so
ugly which probably a lot of you will
and i got it in an extra-large how
ridiculous is that but it was the only
one there it was on sale and it was just
like sitting on top by itself and I just
looked at it and I was like this is
adorable it's tan and it has like a
bunch of different colors like like
weaved into it kind of and I think it's
just supposed to be like a sweater but
it's an extra large so it goes like to
my knees it's literally like a sweater
dress it's so big a can you tell like
falls off my body but I think it's so
cute and definitely cute with leggings
and the last thing I have is from
Topshop which I've never been that I was
super excited to go there and it was
actually really cool and the only thing
I got a peplum top and this is so
adorable it just like like flows out
right there cuz it's peplum and it goes
pretty high on my neck which I like and
then it zipper zup the back and this is
so adorable I love it so much into it
flattering peplums I think
oh my gosh I just realized I wore this
scarf in my last video don't judge me
okay but um that's all I got in new york
city and this video probably got so long
I'm sorry that's just me and thank you
so much for watching um yeah I don't
forget to thumbs up this video or the
naked urban decay basics istoria you so

next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
