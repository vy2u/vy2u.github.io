York City I went over the past weekend
and I had such a fun time I went with my
cousin in my aunt and Lucy my twin
sister we had so much fun we did a lot
of fun shopping that I couldn't have
done here some of you may know that I
went to New York City because I put that
picture of me and my sister up on
Instagram in front of the tree so if you
don't follow me on Instagram definitely
follow me at Christian loves Beauty and
you'll be like further updated with Milo
in my last video I said I would put up a
picture of the boots of our three
trooper boots and I never did and some
people were like asking about it so
it'll go right here I promise right now
and then I'm filming with my new tripod
that I got for Christmas so I'm in my
room actually you guys are probably so
confused because I go all over the place
when I'm filming um sometimes I'm in my
sister's loft and sometimes I'm just in
her room and right now in my room so
like my Christmas lights
and I'm sitting in my bed so without
further ado let's just get into the
whole video the first place we went to
is actually support and there's a few
things that I knew I went to buy so
first I got the Dior Addict to life
perfume oh my goodness this is my
favorite scent ever I don't think I've
ever heard anyone talk about it ever
I've never even heard of it just over
the summer I got a little sample cuz you
know like support will give you samples
when you buy stuff and I fell in love
with it like I use that sample to attend
because it's like my favorite scent ever
so I just got I think it's the 1.7 fluid
ounce of do you are addict to life and
yep actions cute not that that matters
but oh my gosh it's just my favorite
smell ever like it smells so good look
next time you go to Sephora anyway that
they have this go and smell this perfume
because I promise a little bit is Dolce
Gabanna white blue now I have loved this
perfume for so long and slow long so
long and all my friends will just get it
all ready cuz I always took her how much
I love it no my friend Kathleen actually
just got me on the little like
rollerball but it's actually good spray
and so I'm gonna keep that with me like
everywhere obviously that goes with me
and all of my bags and like it'll go
with me to school too but now I just
have this one and this isn't even that
big either it's just the point eight
fluid ounces and but yeah yeah as you
can see like obviously it's like not
that big but um this will last me
forever
and this also smells so good oh my gosh
they both smell amazing
and I actually realized that they kind
of smell
similar so that's probably why I like
them so much but I was smelling them one
after another and then I was like you
know these smell a lot I got the naked
urban decay basic and it has all of
those colors foxy walk of shame naked to
faint and crazy see how little this is
it's so cute in comparison to the naked
wanted naked - its I think about like
half the size of those it's just those
pretty colors definitely love this and
we say all the time um I'm actually
wearing it on my eyes right now so if
you guys want a tutorial for this just
comment below then I'll probably do our
next video the tutorial for this
eyeshadow using the naked urban decay
basics huh and then oh and then I feel
like I've been a vib at Sephora for a
long time now but they just gave me this
thing you just like put it in my bag I
don't really know and it came with it
came with like three little cards and I
already put them in my wallet so I don't
have them but like it opened up like
this I have a Cartier Cartier card
heater and then right here we actually
get it pretty cool the mirror that came
there he says vib Beauty Insider support
I usually just a mirror but wow that's
like glare in your face okay so they
just gave me that which is pretty cool
and then the three cards say like I can
have like free shipping 10% off my next
purchase and then the other card I'm so
excited to use it's like go to your
Sephora store and they give you a free
like makeover which is actually yeah I'm
so excited tizi so we'll definitely be
doing that oh my gosh we're so it's nice
to put a brand email bell because you
don't well I don't have a brand new
email but like around where I live I've
only ever ordered online so you're so
excited to another store because I've
never actually been to a granola store
and as I said it was raining so we'll
get how beat up this bag is
punched around but that was kind of sad
look at the back it's just like a paper
bag I wish it said like bring another
and I could like keep it forever but
this sweater and it's black and tan
strips and it's really cool because it's
really tight on the arms but then it's
like baggy right here so I don't know it
looks really cool on and of course like
all of their clothes it's like super
stretchy their stuff is one size fits
all but yeah super super super cute and
I really love that and then I got this
tank top that actually saw online and I
was so excited because they had it and
it's just this black tank top I think
the cut is called Sadie for reference if
you were wondering and it says amazing
baby and the school like print and it's
okay it's I don't think it's supposed to
be cropped but I mean kind of is because
I have such a long torso so and you
could call it a crop top but for most of
you probably won't be I don't know in
between medium but super cute and I
really love that I'm gonna be wearing
that wealth had actually already I'm
gonna wear that with which is this will
be on to necessary clothing we're gonna
keep this bag is hoppin okay I got this
green army jacket I have been looking
for a green like long army jacket for
like frickin ever because I think
they're so cute and I just got this one
the only thing about this is it's not
that dark like it's kind of like a
lighter dark green that makes sense but
I still really love it and it's like
because I was looking for words like
long and get straight there in the
middle and has like buttons and this is
just super cute and I already know I'm
gonna wear it with this amazing baby
tank underneath so that will be coming
up indefinitely so the next thing is
this great pea coat and it's just um
like short I don't know can you tell
it's not like a while with my other two
because I have I have a weight one in a
black one there along with like they go
down past my butt
but this one's short and so yeah I
really like that and it's just gray
really bad at like holding up so you
can't really tell but it has like the
collar and also has a hood which neither
of my pee coats right now do it so I
think that's really cute and I really
like it and then I guess I'll just throw
in some of the stuff I got at the
drugstore um I had to get this oil-free
acne wash by Neutrogena because my
dermatologist recommended this face wash
to me um so yeah I'm seeing a
dermatologist because I'm just having so
much issues with my skin and I actually
saw her like a month ago but I've
supposed to been using it and I haven't
been so I just pick that up and then I
wanted a new mascara so I got the
L'Oreal telescopic carbon black and I've
heard such great things about this mist
Kelly Marie 16 love you girl you said
that this is like your favorite ever so
I went and I bought it because of you
and I'm so excited to try this out and
then I just picked up this Burt's Bees
or punishing lip balm with pomegranate
oil and I really like it like it smells
it smells like burpies you know what
that smell but then it's like it smells
good too like hunger it's kind of like
and it makes your lips have it's
actually like the color of my natural
lips but like I think it's H&amp;amp;M and I got
these tank top and it's just white and
really long so this is me so cute for
like glaring and I'm gonna put it
underneath either that jacket or like a
long cardigan and it's gonna look so
cute with like leggings and boots and
yeah I really like that and then okay
this I think looks so ugly like when you
hold it up like when I saw it I was like
eh oh then I just started like whatever
what the heck tried on and it looks so
cute on it's this um kind of cream
blouse with pink with detailing around
it
no but um it looks so cute on it's like
quarter sleeves and the buttons aren't
button but it has like buttons right
there and also in the back there's like
a button and yeah that's just really
human at American Eagle I got this huge
huge thing and my cousin thinks it's so
ugly which probably a lot of you will
and I got it in an extra-large how
ridiculous is that but it was the only
one there it was on sale and it was just
like sitting on top by itself and I just
looked at it and I was like this is
adorable
it's tan and it has like a bunch of
different colors like like weaved into
it kind of and I think it's just
supposed to be like a sweater but it's
an extra-large so it goes like to my
knees it's literally like a sweater
dress it's so big can you tell like
falls off my body but I think it's so
cute and definitely cute with leggings
and blasts thing I have is from Topshop
which I've never been that I was super
excited to go there and it was actually
really cool and the only thing I got a
peplum top and this is so adorable it's
just like like flows out right there cuz
it's peplum and it goes pretty high on
my neck which I like and then it zip is
up the back and this is so adorable I
love it so watch it's really flattering
peplums I think
oh my gosh I just realized I wore this
scarf in my last video don't judge me
okay but um that's all I got in New York
City and this video probably got so long
I'm sorry that's just me and thank you
so much for watching um yeah I don't
forget to thumbs up this video or the
naked urban decay basics I store you so
much for watching and I'll see you in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
