video and I really liked filming these
just because I don't give you guys the
chance to get to know me a little bit
more when I do these I was just put a
picture on Instagram and then let you
guys common questions and on this one I
think I said something like leave like
interesting comments for like new
questions that I haven't really answered
before so I'm just gonna be answering
some questions I'm just gonna like skip
around so they're not in any other order
and won't get to all of them but I'll do
as many as I can and yeah let's just get
right into it the very first one says
would you ever come to England and
seriously I went to this with your rapid
weeks oh my gosh okay thank you and I
would love to come to England I've never
been but I think it would be really cool
and I've actually never even been to
Europe but that's a goal in life his
next one says what's the cutest thing
that Justin has ever done for you and it
would probably be this past Saturday it
was our one year anniversary and he
actually sent me flowers I was very
surprised and they're very pretty and
I'll put a picture right here they're so
cute i love them they're actually on a
shelf in my room right now yep do you
miss your long hair by the way I love
you oh my gosh okay I love you too and I
do miss my long hair a lot actually but
good news is hair does grow mine is
growing back when I first got it cut it
was literally like up to my collarbone
so it has grown quite a bit i jus miss
my long hair though and let me know what
you guys think here's the picture of my
long hair and my short hair pretty much
like the same spot and what one do you
guys think looks better on me I've
gotten both like some people say you're
not pretty without long hair and some
people say you look way prettier with
short hair so let me know down below
what you guys think do you get allowance
no sadly I do not get allowance I wish I
used to that what I was little all this
one's cute says favorite childhood
breakfast food love you Gretchen I love
you too kitty cat 20 pretty much every
day I ate pancakes when I was growing up
because I loved pancakes I actually
still do like them want to hear like how
fat I was my new year's resolution
I remember when I was in like third or
fourth grade who's T at least five
pancakes every day yep what do you want
to measure in University and what
university d do you want to go to I'm
pretty sure I want a major in biology
and i'm not sure what school I want to
go to yet this one size is your recent
get by / yes it is but actually got
shipped out to a girl named Maggie I
believe she lived somewhere down south
yep this one says how long have you and
Justin been dating like I just said our
one-year anniversary was on saturday so
we've been dating for a little R year
now which is so weird to me I feel like
we just started dating but yeah it's
already been a year you rather have a
tiger head or a monkey head definitely
monkey because I love monkeys they're so
cute this one says what advice would you
give a girl who was trying to give
herself more respect ok this is like a
really deep one questions like these are
tough oh girl that's trying to give
herself more respect you are obviously
realizing that you deserve respect you
need to respect yourself so if you're
trying to give yourself more respect do
just that like you realize you need to
take time to do things that are
important for you focus on your goals
and what makes you happy because you
don't want to be doing things for other
people make sure you have your own goals
in your own like aspirations like what
you want to do with your life is and
what you think is important don't do
stuff because other people tell you to
or because other people are doing it do
what makes you happy and if you want to
respect yourself you must demand respect
from others too so don't put up with
anyone else's crap and like you've
probably heard this before but like
surround yourself with people that make
you happy and if someone's bringing you
down or if you have a friend that's not
really helping you as a person in any
way then it's not worth it then they're
not really your friend and don't put
yourself with negative people because
you'll feel negative and you won't be
happy to respect yourself you need to
demand respect from others but you also
need to respect others too so try not to
be a judgmental totally like be
accepting of what everyone else is
beliefs are because everyone's different
everyone has their own story so you
really have to be
like not judgmental towards others and
really just try to be like open and a
positive person and I know that was a
really open-ended question but if you're
trying to respect yourself just try to
be like the best you that you can be and
I know that's not really specific focus
on the good things in life and what your
goals and try to think of your future
and where you want to be and what you
need to do to get there and how you are
going to accomplish like all that you
want to accomplish because that's what
will keep you focused and on track and
not side tracted by all the stupid
things that you can in your teenage
years so to respect yourself and respect
others is really big part of that too I
think I hope I answered your question if
you were a tree what tree would you be
PS i love you all I love you too okay ah
Lucy's favorite trees have weeping
willow and I think those are really
pretty and cool looking so probably a
weeping willow tree it says favorite
working out song at the moment I really
got a song blame it's just really catchy
I think it's by Calvin Harris yep it's
by calvin harris and john newman and i
really do like that song this one's just
how tall are you i am haifa d and the
next one says how old are you i'm 17
years old it feels really weird to say
that because that feels really old but
I'm 58 and seven years old this one says
tips on how to handle school sports
social life and a job and if you're me
and you tube to the mix girl I feel you
that is really hard it's so hard to keep
up with everything and honestly a lot of
times you can't do it all in like one
aspect or another lacks in for me like
I'll just say it how it is a lot of
times I don't get to put as much time
into YouTube as I would really like to I
would love to put up two or three videos
a week like I would love to make all the
videos that i want to make and like edit
them flawlessly and add cool music and
like interact with you guys as much as I
can like I absolutely love it that's why
I do it but just with school senior year
trying to apply to college like um
sports like crew like trying to keep
some aspect of your social life it's
really really hard especially as a
teenager so you really just got to try
to balance it and you have to know your
priorities like school probably
obviously
first so you just always have to keep
that in mind and just keep it all in
perspective and just really try your
best I know it's not easy and a lot of
times you might not be able to hang out
with your friends I certainly don't and
it sucks but that's how it is what's
your favorite thing to do during school
vacations it would probably be to go
with on vacation like to the beach
because who doesn't love to go tan at
the beach I don't know that's me i love
the beach out always love to go
somewhere warm ooh this one i do you
think before the question sorry I'm like
whoo cuz they look interesting lose your
voice for a day if you could meet one of
your subscribers or for a year if you
can meet all of your subscribers oh my
gosh i would definitely lose my voice
for you to meet all of you like that
would be so flipping awesome if I could
meet like 65,000 people that watch my
videos how incredibly insane would that
be so definitely I would choose to meet
every single one of you oh my gosh that
would be awesome you could eat one thing
for the rest of your life what would it
be love you I love you too you guys are
like giving me the love like when I read
your comments you don't understand like
you're putting me in such a good mood
right Alec I'm so happy any one thing
real ours my life it might be bananas
with peanut butter because that's just
like a really big obsession right now
and it has been for a while what's your
favorite way to wear your hair well
probably since I've cut it just down and
straight because I and that's when it
looks like the longest sorry I keep
touching me in this video too yeah
probably down and straight just cuz i
think that's when it looks longer this
one says would you rather go with no
brandy melville or no makeup oh I said
that really funny oh definitely no
brandy melville like you know I would
live I know everyone thinks I'm so
obsessed with brandy melville and like I
do love love love their clothes but I
feel I'm not as obsessed as I used to be
and like I really would die without
makeup because I like makeup and it
makes me feel confident together so I
would go without brandy melville this
one says what was your worst date um I
really haven't gone on like a first date
I know that sounds weird like I have a
boyfriend Justin but I mean we didn't
have that
whole like awkward first date kind of
thing because we were friends first
before he's like became my boyfriend so
I never had like a first date where I
had to like you know like impress
someone or like anything like that
biggest fear my biggest fear would
probably be drowning just because uh
yeah does Lucy have a boyfriend is he
cute he is super cute his name is Danny
this one says future kids names hmm this
is a very cool question my one friend
Hannah loves like cool like interesting
names that like no one's kids are really
name and mike hanna wants to name her
kids Delaney I think and that's actually
when my friends names and she's so cute
and like I love that angle a knee so
maybe Delaney or like I really like the
name Nicholas for a boy ever liked the
name Nick and I think for a girl I
really like the name Amanda I don't know
why I just like the name Amanda that'd
be a cool name Nicholas and Amanda those
are gonna be my future children what's
your current favorite Netflix show and
at the moment the show i'm watching on
netflix is orange is the new black and i
know i'm like late like hop on that
train because i feel like everyone else
has already watched it but it's like
really funny and kind of cool so yeah I
like that show right now you should
totally watch it if you haven't already
soon says who is your role model and one
before said who inspires you the most I
can't think of someone that's like
famous or something that is like my role
model and i'm alex s with them like day
to day like if you just surround
yourself with friends and people that
are like really positive people and that
you like enjoy being with and are just
really awesome good people then like
they'll inspire you so if I this one
friend Taylor I love Taylor so much she
is honestly like she inspires me she's
probably one of my biggest role models
just because she's so driven and
friendly and she's so willing to like
work really hard at whatever it is she's
doing to get to where she wants to be
like athletically and academically it
she's such a hard worker and I really
love that about her and she's also like
the sweetest human being on earth so
yeah role model and inspiration to me
would be my friend Taylor love you
Taylor and the last one I'll answer is
