my outfit of the week for the beginning
of October I know you guys love these
videos so I'm so excited to film them
for you this year know I mentioned this
enough with weeks before but I just
personally like dressing up for class
because it makes me feel a lot better
and more productive but if you want to
wear subhansin t-shirt go right ahead

will be including those lazy days and up
coming out for the week's because I
didn't for a while and you guys are
saying like no we still want to see your
lazy days so actually in the next one
you'll see I wear like workout clothes
like twice so yeah there's a couple
things I just wanna bring your attention
the first thing is one of my best
friend's Caroline I love Caroline I miss
you've chosen go to my college sadly I
was hurt so much but anyway it guys
she's so good at makeup she's literally
amazing and I'm always in like seriously
doing my makeup
anyway she made this makeup in cear√°
it's called Beauty by Carol look at how
good she's at makeup guys oh and plus
her eyes are like this beautiful blue so
make it just look so good on her if
you're any makeup in fashion and if
you're watching this video there's a
high chance you are seriously go follow
her I like literally die when I see her
like beautiful eye shadow picks every
day like just like I wish my eyeshadow
looks like that it doesn't so definitely
give her a follow tell her that I sent
to you and Caroline when you're watching
this I love you I miss you come visit
these like now and the other things I
just want to mention is if you guys
didn't notice I don't even know if you
can tell but I've been organizing my
videos into playlists so some of you
been asked like where like the blog miss
2015-2016 videos if you want to see on
my Appa the week so I put them all on a
playlist if you want to see on my hauls
I've just been organizing my videos into
playlists but it's easier if you guys to
watch if you're new to my channel or
whatever and if you want to you can like
binge watch that and cuz I think when
you finish one it just goes to the next
one so that's fun and also can't leave
me comment down below I'm wondering if
you guys think it would be helpful then
I started uploading on scheduled days
like if I have a schedule because I've
never had a schedule here on YouTube but
I'm started feeling like hey Gretchen
you should have a schedule it'll make
you more efficient with like editing and
uploading and then it'll be easier for
you guys to know like oh I know to
expect like a new video from catching
today so it definitely me a comment down
below I'm thinking I might start
uploading like Sundays and Wednesdays so

further ado let's get on into the
