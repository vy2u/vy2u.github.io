can tell it is Marathon Monday okay I

straightened but it got a little wavy
throughout the day I just had this block
a bandana on I'd smelled gems on my
cheek so that was really fun
and I'm really tan because I got back
from Miami of the night before I like
midnight and then to be honest I
actually didn't even wear that white
tank top during the day because it was
so hot out so I just had that little bra
that top thing from American Apparel on

was 2 bucks so I would highly recommend
that you go check it out still there and
my shoulders were starting to peel and
as you see throughout the week they get
worse well there's my roommate say hi so
yeah I just had his hair and then I'm
just wearing these red shorts from
brandy melville it was just like a super
fun casual outfit obviously I would not
wear this to class or anything but it is
just a very festive Marathon Monday of
it I notice I match the flag behind me
so that's cute and then I just wore
these white little converse that were
really dirty they're good to wear and I
was gonna kiss goodbye but I noticed I
betrayed my nails which is a gel
manicure and obviously I have my David

eyelashes engines too so I literally
have not been wearing any makeup since I
was so tan from Miami I just had my
eyelash extensions and that's it and

blue sweater which is just an
anthropology my shoulders are getting
worse indeed guys I literally cover
myself emotion but I still peel on my
shoulders a lot and it's not getting
better but whatever ok then I'm wearing
