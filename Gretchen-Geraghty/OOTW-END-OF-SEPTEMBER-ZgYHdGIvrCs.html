outfit of the week for the end of
September and normally I don't film like
little intros to them but I just thought
I would for this one because I actually
filmed every single outfit this week cuz
usually I film them like all over the
place like I have an outfit of the week
and it spans over like two months and
every gets mad at me and is like this
isn't the point of it after the week and
I'm like I know like I'm just a mess in
like some days wear sweatpants or don't
go to concert ever so this week I went
to class every day like I'm supposed to
a covergirl and for those of you that
like are in college and just were
swapping some t-shirts like by all means
do that if you want to and if you're
comfortable doing that but for me like I
would recommend if you were like me
literally if I get up get ready and like
put on a nice outfit I'm just way more
productive for the day and like
participate in cost and feel good and
like I just think it's a good thing
going and I'm gonna try to carry that
out throughout the semester so I get my
out of the week's during their week in
all in one week which would be nice so
yeah without further ado let's just get
on to the outfits for this week I really
like them to take good ones hey everyone
so like I said I filmed all these
outfits in one week like continuously so
I'm very proud of myself but today my
hair is just natural and I'm wearing
this case beige bracelet I always wear
in my feather Alex and Ani
so I'm sick right now you can tell I
like them actually really sick I like
103 degree fever so pray for me and my
nails are just the same my top is from
Urban Outfitters and I'm gonna use a
black Jaime's hit leggings from
Lululemon I just love them I'm just
wearing these sandals with little jewels
on them they're new and they're from

brown foot pops that are just from oh

leather and also people are asking me
like the weather situation okay Boston
is I believe are polar

like I'm not kidding like okay probably
not even like 75 but whatever so that's
why I am like trust very differently
every day
but today I wanna make up I like going
to what makes my belly and you think -

I just had to throw on my lip liner
that's why I did it
