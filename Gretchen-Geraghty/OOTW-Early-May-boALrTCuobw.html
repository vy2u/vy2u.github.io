week for early May and I know I'm
getting behind on these but I'm going to
try to catch up as soon as possible and
actually to begin I'm going to be
showing you this app that I really like
to find apps ideas and it's called style
kick and I usually just scroll through
all the different outfit ideas and I
love all the pictures they have on here
and they help me decide what I want to
wear for my outfits during the week and
what's really cool is you can click this
little button and it shows you where you
can buy the outfits like online and
everything like the exact pieces and I
usually just look at the trending tab
because they have the pictures that I
like the most and I'm obsessed with that
outfit I just think it's so cute and I
always look to this if I don't know what
to wear and you should definitely check
it out I have it all linked down below
and you can follow me it's at GL v YT
orange of my twitter so yeah so getting
into Monday my hair is just curled
loosely with a nume curling wand like
I've been doing a lot and I really like
the way that looks and that is like my
go-to hairstyle I feel like doing it my
earrings are just pearl earrings are we
surprised nope nope and then a my my
Tiffany necklace
my nails are my ANC a French manicure
and I think they like that the whole
week I'm pretty sure
then my top is from I think Banana
Republic that might be wrong I feel like
one of you told me it wasn't from there
I think it's from there but it's just an
elephant shirt and dressed in the
grandma kata for me GG I love it so so
much and my sweater is from brandy
melville and it's just really comfy cozy
and warm and my skirt is also from
brandy melville it's just also very cozy
it's like really soft knit material and
it's grey and I'm wearing that bracelet
which is actually from Abercrombie
believe it or not but it's really pretty
my flats I want to say her from Target
they're just nude flats and I really
like those a lot and it was chilly so
that's why I wore that sweater because
some days it's just randomly chilly
nights you know ok Tuesday this is
actually my favorite outfit Tuesday and
Wednesday are by far my favorite outfit
our foundations and my skin looks like
super better normally

but you know what I need and I'm wearing
eyeliner and mascara and I'm wearing
this layer necklace from Urban
Outfitters it's just silver and my black
top is from brandy melville same nails

sweater is from brandy melville it's
just tan with all those holes and if you
guys have been watching my videos
forever you know I've added that forever
and it's always been one of my favorites
and these pants I'm obsessed with I
showed them in a haul recently or just
green pants that are like slouchy and
uncomfortable they're from Abercrombie
and they tie at the top and I just think
they're so so cute and they're really
really comfortable and my sandals are
also from Abercrombie they're just dark
brown leather sandals and I've been
wearing them it's so so much and I just
think they're so cute okay so Wednesday
I'm wearing a bra let that is similar to
that top but it's the bralette form you
know what I need my nails are the same
I'm just wearing some more in silver
Alex and on ease cuz I'm just wondering

and necklace is Merman Outfitters it's
actually Lucy sad about it and there's
the bra I was talking about
it's like similar to the tank top from
random elbow but it's like bralette form
and this I'm so excited for because I've
never won this little jumpsuit before
and sorry that jackets from brandy
melville it's just like sweet like black
comfortable jacket and this jumps who I
think is so unique and so normal it's
Roberta Outfitters and it has this
little print all down the front and
actually down the legs on the side it
also has some tassels and I just singes
at the waist to give some like
definition I like how it goes in so you
don't look like a big potato sack and
it's just like this purpley floral print
and I wore my black booties and I really
like the way the whole outfit came
together I think it's so it's so
adorable and I wore foundation again
I've been liking wearing my foundation
in it from a cover girl in case you're
wondering and today I think tanner I
think I laid out the day before I've
been getting really tanned recently just
laying outside and my hair is actually
natural today I'm wearing my Tiffany
necklace those three different blade
bracelets that one's from Kate
speed and our company in the federal
tsunami and this is one of my all-time
like favorite shirts it's just this
white lacy flowy top from Urban
Outfitters and I just think it's like so
unique and so cute I like how the bottom
goes out like that in the sleeves and
then these jeans I literally feel like I
wear in every single after the week but
I'm just obsessed with them they're my
American Eagle just ripped jeggings I
think like medium wash with dress up
billion little rips down the front and
they're so comfortable and then my
sandals are from Target and they're just
like brown crisscross II sandals and I
think it's really cute with that outfit
and yeah I think I always just wear
white tops but that would say wear jeans
my doughnuts wear and there's my baby
Ozzy's really know the baby is a huge
Great Dane but I just love cuddling and
petting and he keeps me company such a
cutie pie okay so more Friday I'm
