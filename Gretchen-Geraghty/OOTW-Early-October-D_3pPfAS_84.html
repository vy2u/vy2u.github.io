keeping up with my outfit of the weeks I
have so many I have to post so this is
actually early October that's why
there's something shorts in here but
yeah this is Monday my hair is natural
um I'm wearing some silver Alex
surroundings I think was like my cupcake
and red monkey and I don't have nail
polish on my cream sweater is from
PacSun and it's really cozy comfy and
has lace at the bottom and like I said
it was heroic Tober so it's still really
really hot out eggs that's why I'm
wearing and those short little shorts
for him ever crummy and I'm wearing he's
really really cute bronzer sandal that I
love and I actually my friend Hanna is
it I borrow because I like them so yeah
that's what I wore on Sunday lady
Tuesday you actually might recognize his
outfit from my little like lookbook
thing I had it was my most recent video
I will get down below you didn't get a
chance to watch it but um yeah in
addition to being in my lookbook I
actually wore this to school too so it's
a cream topping Lulu's some olive green
pants from Lulu's um I wore some gold
Alexson a tease and also those team
Brown others things that are just okey
so yeah and my necklace was also from
loose and I tried to like leave goodbye
that was that alright Wednesday I curled
my hair and I actually really like the
way it turned out because I haven't curl
it too much since I got it cut but yeah
so it was like really curly for
Wednesday um and my my silver Tiffany
necklace that I actually wear like all
the time and some more ABS Nadi's I
think I mixed gold and silver I know
rebel and then my tan Longchamp is just
a tan on champ bag that I use for school
a lot and I'm wearing to Royal for you
jeggings from American Eagle I was
feeling a little spicy and yeah
especially I was wearing some cheetah
flats which are totally like out of my
comfort zone
no no but yeah that is what I wore
okay so Thursday my hair might look a
little familiar it's because I just left
it curly from the day before and so it
kind of like got a little bit more loose
which I actually like a lot I was going
falls out a little over some eyeshadow
so that was like super Sam seemed a
little like out of the ordinary but so
yeah I just left my hair like like get
less curly from the day before I don't
know how to explain it and I'm hurt the
same Tiffany necklace in some more out
tsunamis and you will notice when I
don't know what to wear I wear really
really plain stuff so I honestly having
troubles with what to wear so I wore a
black long some sharp impacts on on some
dark jeggings from Abercrombie and then
I wore some leather flip-flops because I
clearly had no idea what to wear so
that's about his claim as you can get
and I didn't have school this Friday I
forget which Friday it was a really long
time ago but I didn't at school so
that's why there's four outfits in this
video but yeah thank you so much for
