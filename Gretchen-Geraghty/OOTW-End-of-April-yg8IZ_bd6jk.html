like this but yeah and it has like those
little ruffly layers at the bottom and
it buttons up and I just think it's so
cute and I want some really gross old
Sperrys on your eyes I'm nasty who are

obsessed with they're just these purpley
maroon leggings and they're really soft

my hands because they're just really
soft and comfy and I love them and for
shoes I'm wearing those same gross old
Sperrys like I said I really better get
