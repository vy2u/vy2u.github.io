brandy melville and then I'm wearing
these shorts that I remember I got from
American Eagle like so long ago and
they're really too big on me but I like
grew into them woohoo they're just a
high-waisted like light wash ripped ones

converse so yeah and oh there I'm
showing my mascara some more all right
then on Wednesday my hair is natural

pretty light makeup just some mascara
