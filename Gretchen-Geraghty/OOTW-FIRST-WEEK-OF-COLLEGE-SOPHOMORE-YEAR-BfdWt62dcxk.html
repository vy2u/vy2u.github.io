to be my outfit of the week for my first
week of classes at college my sophomore
year so I actually have six outfits
because we didn't start looking on
Monday we started classes on like I
don't know the middle of the week but
anyway so for my very first day of
classes my hair was just straightened
not really that well and the makeup I
wore is just but I've been wearing like
every day so it comes this video if you
want a little makeup tutorial on that
but my lungs say that black and white
striped shirt is from naked and my jeans
are just from Abercrombie I showed them
in my like Paul outfit ideas video
recently and I just high-waisted
Abercrombie jeans and my black booties
are from a Chinese Laundry so today my
hair is just curled and this is the
second few classes and I'm wearing like
my foundation like my mates like
everything like I said and my nails are
just like the French and T nails and I'm
a Michael Kors watch just some silver
bracelets and that green top is from
Urban Outfitters and my black cropped
leggings are from Lululemon and my brown
sandals are from Steve Madden okay so
today my hair is just really loosely
curled and I thought my face looked so
funny because I wasn't wearing
foundation and I didn't put on eyeliner
so I say that I just looked so different
and also Samberg so much blush right
there but I swear it wasn't that much in
real life and also like every single day
I'm just turning my David your my
necklace that I showed also recently in
a haul video and yeah just weren't
looking everyday and then I'm going to
is silver bracelets a feather Alex nonny
bracelet and the other bracelet is from
a Kate Spade and my dress is from Urban
Outfitters I'm getting so many
compliments on I seriously love it and
then my brown sandals are from Tory
Burch okay so today when makeup looks a
lot better it's like the X's on
foundation and that's like every day I
was saying I'm gonna do like a tutorial
or at least like a little chitchat you
ready with me as you can see and same
nails I straighten my hair just some
silver bracelets and look at my shoulder
it was so rad because I wore my Louis
Vuitton bag like the never full I think
is what it's called so we definitely
don't be dumb like me and put in like
your laptop in like three text books
like that was a really bad idea because
it was like killing my shoulder but
usually I just wear a backpack just that
day were my
Madonn bag and then my red romper is
Sookie wise used to love it I just need
to like flattering and it's from Vanilla
Sky and I was sad because when you sit
down the front of it gets so wrinkly
like do any of you have dresses or
rompers that do that like what am I
supposed to do because when I say just
gets really wrinkly and then my little
booties were from Steve Madden okay so
today my hair is curled it's curled like
pretty tightly curled too I just have
the same like everyday makeup I'll just
play the lip stuff I have on quite like
every day it just is Urban Decay lip
liner and it's in the color naked so I
love that statement necklace and my
dress I said I get so many questions on
it's from Urban Outfitters but I've had
a click a while now and I got it on sale
so it's totally I don't think they sell
it anymore
and then my black sandals I've been
loving - I just although simple they are
so cute and maybe tiny little bit of
heel which I think just give me a little
bit of confidence those are from Steve
Madden and the same makeup for today
same nails my hair is just a little bit
wavy and for those of you that saw a
haul video that I showed this outfit in
you are gonna laugh because literally I
said I was gonna wear this every day and
I wish that I could my sweater and my
skirt is from Urban Outfitters and I
just love the way looks together I just
think it's so cute and my black booties
are from Chinese Laundry and everything
that I got recently and I can find a
link to I will link down below so thank
you so much for watching this week's out
of the week and I'll see you my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
