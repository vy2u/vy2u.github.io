Tuesday nights in there and I was
actually so sunburned look it was
probably one of the worst days of my
life you can't tell in the video but
really it was bad that's probably why my
hair looks so awful
it was just like dried from swimming in
the pool my sandals are from Nordstrom's
and my dress I got at t.j.maxx obsessed
with there's there's like cutouts and I
think it's so adorable so yeah that was
it all right and then for Wednesday I
forgot to film but I'm wearing this long
maxi dress from forever 21 and I loved
it so much it's like navy blue with
flowers and it's seriously one of my
favorite dishes ever I think it is so so
cute alright on to Thursday I'm wearing
these mint green feather earrings sorry
the lighting is kind of bad my lace
dress is from PacSun I got it actually
really recently now I'm the same lucky
nude flats and I'm borrowing Lucy's bag
from American Eagle and I don't know if
you can tell but this whole time my hair
is kind of natural and maybe I didn't
use heat on my hair the whole week
because I was just swimming in the ocean
and in the pools all day every day and
yeah that was it on to Friday I'm
wearing this dress from brandy melville
it's just like a floral print and it was
so windy in that dress
on its own is very very short so I don't
know if you can tell I keep pulling it
down and my hair is just it's crazy
natural I don't even know beachy self

from Nordstrom's and my nail polish is
the same all week it was like mint green
