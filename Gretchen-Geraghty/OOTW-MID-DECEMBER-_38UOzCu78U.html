the beginning of this outfit of the week
video and I wanted to film this a quick
little intro right now actually because
I dropped my camera when I was at USC I
just got back yesterday
and I digress but I just went to Urgent
Care because I'm actually really sick
right now and I have mono
so fun stuff I like just found out and
I've never had mono my whole life so I'm
really sad I cried when she told me cuz
I was surprised anyway that is not the
point of this
I think I like actually broke my camera
I like this screen that I'm looking at
right now I was a little cracked cuz I
dropped our Tasha's hardwood floor and
the lens like right there there's like a
big divot in it because I dropped it and
I think the camera is messed up like see
over here is glare over here is blurry I
don't know if that's like just how the
viewfinder is if that's actually what
it's recording
but anyway without further ado let's
just get into the out for the week I'm a
hot mess alright guys so keep in mind
that I had at mono this week so this
wasn't even filmed all in one week this
was like the week in the week after
because I was feeling really crappy and
so there's only four outfits too but
anyway my nails just as red as he color
he looks kind of funny because I like
painted them and they chipped and then I
painted them again and then I watched as
Michael Kors my bracelet is Tiffany's
and my lymph nodes are so swollen can
you tell like they hurt and also what's
funny is I looked like literally obese
like I didn't have a neck because it was
just it's like why it is my jaw if that
make sense anyway my top is from Target
I borrowed it from Taylor and my black
high-waisted wonder unders are from
Lululemon and they're my favorite pairs
of leggings I always wear them and I'll
have them linked down below as well as
some other things in this video and my
boots were from fried okay today my long
sleeve of striped shirt is from a brandy
Melville it's so comfy and stretchy and
I just love it it's like a PJ shirt or a
school shirt you know it can be both my
white little sneakers are just converse
they're in kids and I always get
questions about them so yeah they're
just kids and those are just a dark wash
American Eagle jeggings that I always
wear everyday
my hair was natural so it's a bit feet
my nails are just the same red color
okay today I believe my hair is natural
again I did a little more makeup think I
have a little Kylie Jenner let's get
going on I painted my nails blue my
scarf is just this one from moon cats I
got questioned about it in my last out
of the week so it's really funny is my
white shirt with see-through but good
thing I've a scarf on I didn't even
notice the long sleeve dress from brandy
oh and I was being a freak because
literally my background is always a mess
so sorry about that
and then my black little shoes are from
Chinese Laundry scene jeggings and then
I turned into like a quad stretch so I
just stretched the other quad you know
okay and today is for the last day I
actually did wear this on the Friday I
were all little lemon I took out my nail
polish still sick see like I'm trying
guys
my headbands from Ljubljana and my
scarves from Lululemon my sweatshirt
from the lemonade Taylor thanks Taylor
you'll be where my leggings are from the
women they're just like wonders but
they're cool flower print on top and
then surprise surprise my purple
short-sleeved shirts from Lululemon you
guys comment down below if you'd be
interested in seeing like an athletic
Alpha week because now that I'm home for
break I only wear like athletic clothes
every day excited workout you know with
my family so let me know if you'd like
to see that and then my sneakers were
just from Nike PS in case you're
wondering I made this obviously called
the middle of December because I
couldn't even fill my outfit for last
like two weeks of college anyway because
it was finals and I was so stressed out
and then I have one other off of the
week from college coming up after this
and then I'll just film some outfit
while I'm home over break so thank you
