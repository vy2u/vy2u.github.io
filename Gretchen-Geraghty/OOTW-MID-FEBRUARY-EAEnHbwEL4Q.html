behind on outfit of the weeks and you
guys have been waiting and waiting for
them so thank you for being so patient
but today I'm Monday I have literally no
makeup on just like my extensions I've
been liking keeping it pretty natural
I'm I like everyday jewelry and my
sweater top is from Urban Outfitters and
as you could tell it's like cropped and
quite small on me it's an extra small
and I just realized that Gretchen it
doesn't really fit you anymore and my my
black Goldy jeans I love them but I just
kind of inspired me like I have so many
clothes but don't really fit anymore on
my black little sneakers or from Steve
Madden I black jackets from Patagonia so
I've been on the Poshmark cake I've been
posting a bunch of stuff to sell for you
guys so I thought this is a perfect time
to stop and chat about Poshmark really
quick over the past couple of months
I've been posting like crazy on Poshmark
and I'm not kidding like so many
freaking clothes have actually employed
the help of my friend Hannah and my twin
sister Lucy and they're helping me post
my clothes and Poshmark so a lot of you
asked like where all my clothes fit and
I do have three closets here luckily at
bu I'm so thankful for that but also I
have Poshmark it's just an app that you
can like so close and you can buy
clothes and it'll be closed that like
don't fit people anymore or they just
don't want them or it's not their style
or it's too big or too small or they
realize they bought it twice I've been
guilty of doing bad times yep so for me
it's like all those reasons I love going
on there guys for when I want something
and they don't sell it anymore so like
I've wanted sweaters from Urban
Outfitters and then they go out of stock
and then I find on Poshmark you know
they have a bajillion Brad's and I like
any you can think of like Nike Adidas
Lululemon Louboutin Michael Kors you can
download the app and check out my closet
I will have it linked first thing in the
description box and I'm my username is
just Gretchen with five ends so then for
Tuesday again my makeup is pretty
natural I love having eyelash extensions
because I pretty much just do that for
my eyes and I'm like eyebrows and
bronzer and stuff and again with my like
everyday jewelry there's black sweaters
from Urban Outfitters I'm so obsessed
with it and in these jeans I'm pretty
sure from Express yeah those are my
experts jeans I love them so much
they're just dark wash skinny jeans and
they're jeans fit me so well like I
don't know why Express has been hiding
from me all these years because they
have literally the best ever and I
literally wear these black Steve Madden
shoes like every single day so yeah that
was Tuesday okay so for Wednesday I
think
straighten my hair today it literally is
like so long before I cut it recently
but yeah I just have the can eyelash
extensions some eyebrow big buy
disability that Reds a little bit this
sweater is so cute to Ruby and Jenna
this little store in Syosset and then my
jeans are just mother jeans I love them
and then again same shoes when I also
got a dark gel manicure which I love
then net for Thursday I literally have
no makeup on except for my eyelash
extensions this cropped red sweater is
from honey bum and then I have my dark
Johnny curium and then my leggings are
just Lululemon I think there were the
original line ones but the new line ones
are just as good I love both of them so
yeah and I got wear the same shoes okay
then for Friday I'm like talking to my
friends during this but I wore a little
bit more make up because you guys
probably remember this appetite took a
bunch of pictures and they have fairly
good Instagram and this top is just from
American Apparel by the way are they
still around anymore did they like go
out of business I don't even know and
then that skirt is for my left I got it
recently I love it and then my black
booties that are over the knee I get so
many questions about they're like pretty
old what they're from Chinese Laundry so
yeah and yeah again a quick little plug
goodbye Poshmark don't forget you can
download the app for free with my link
in the description box and also I just
thought of a really good idea
you guys should comment your closets
down below in the comments because then
I can like stock your closets and buy
your cute clothes because of a
Shopaholic I know it's a problem okay
I'm not only inviting you to just like
go get other people's clothes so you can
buy clothes it like for a cheaper on
there cuz it's like obviously really
smart and like an affordable way to shop
but also like if you're like Fogg
Archana I'm like you and my closets it's
full of clothes but I don't wear anymore
go on there and start selling I love you
guys and make you so much for watching
I'll see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
