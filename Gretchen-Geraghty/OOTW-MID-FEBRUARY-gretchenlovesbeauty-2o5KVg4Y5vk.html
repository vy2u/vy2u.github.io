Kors watch my blue jeans are just from
American Eagle and then my brown riding
boots are just from up Frye alright on
Tuesday my hater is I think lightly
curled or just natural I don't even know
I've seen jewelry as usual I just like
pink gel manicure that I have all week
long I was borrowing Lucy's light gray
cropped sweater from reading level and I
loved it so much I actually decided for
myself as the other day and I'm
interesting these black high-waisted
little lemon wonder Enders started my
voice is like gone right now doing this
voice over I miss reading these at black
sneakers and it's just like a comfy
casual day star my room is like a mess
in the back
but anyway so for Wednesday my hair is
just hurry in the training grooves
natural yeah oh no I blow dried it
because when I blow dry it it's like a
little bit wavy but like mine is
actually straight so yeah I blow dried
I've been looking at doing that in the
morning after I workout and like shower
and everything and I was just saying a
light pink gel manicure on my bed
Burberry jacket on today and I just have
this pan red long-sleeve a crop top this
is like my favorites like I always wear
it it's just from PacSun wearing these
light wash high-waisted jeans from
Abercrombie and they're like super high
waisted as them in dark wash because my
favorite jean-robert combi I love them
