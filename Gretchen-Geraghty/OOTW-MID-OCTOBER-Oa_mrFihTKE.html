be my app of the week for the middle of
October and I tried to slow this down a
bit because I knew you guys were saying
about two weeks were a bit rushed so
today for Monday I just straightened my
hair did some natural looking makeup I
have my typical jewelry that I wear like
everyday Tiffany bracelet David Yurman
ring Savior my necklace card earrings
Ramez bracelet and everything I can show
on this video will be linked down below
if I can find the links and this top is
super old it's just from Abercrombie and
I know a lot of these outfits look super
summery but this out week is from the
middle of October and it has been so
warm in Boston until like this past week
so yeah these jeans I just got from Ruby
and Jenna they're a boutique in Syosset
and then these booties are from ASOS
guys are seriously my favorite movies
I've talked about a million times
go get them I'll link them down below
you're welcome and this black leather
jacket is just from all scenes is one of
my favorite and I just love the way this
outfit looks together so yeah that was
it for Monday ok Tuesday the lighting is
wearable I'm really sorry because I
filmed like way too late at night but I
believe I just straightened my hair
again same jewelry as usual really
shipped pink nails by today that hair
tie was not huge so I had to get rid of
it but just like typical Jordanna my top
is actually from Zara it's just yellow
crop top which I know it look very
summery this album really doesn't go
together guys I even really don't know
how to make outfits like I don't know
why your Janie outfit advice for me and
then those at shorts from Urban
Outfitters cardigans brandy melville and
then those shoes are Sam Edelman love
them you guys can wear them with all the
time they're just like cute little clip
on shoes love them ok Wednesday I feel
like you guys look so sober I'm really
sorry if I'm a bit more makeup had some
fun shimmery eyeshadow straighten my
hair my romper is just from honey bum
I'm obsessed with it in fun story I just
have to show that little clip of me
pulling it up because I actually pulled
off the button on the back I was being
really rough with it so that was done
and I'm not kidding I stapled the top of
it together this day guys I stapled it
but it works totally fine and I just
really need to learn
so okay yeah so those brown booties are
from Steve Madden and I didn't like the
way I kept showing them so that I
finally end up taking them off and
that's why that foot is there because I
just took off booty to show you so yeah
all righty then Thursday it's gonna be
the last day because one of these days
this week I actually didn't film because
I did like my outfit and I was just
struggling trying to film this outfit so
then I moved it into my bathroom whether
it's better lighting because it was
really late my hair just kind of natural
kind of wavy I've been leaving it kind
of just messy recently because it's just
easy that way I painted my nails it's
really pretty blue color same jewelry
this top is so pretty it's also from
Ruby and Jenna that's a little boutique
in so I asked it it's why I'm showing it
all that you super soon and then my
black high waisted leggings are just
women and then I was in Brown at riding
boots on Fri love them haven't worn them
so long so yeah that was it for this
outfit the beak I really hope you guys
enjoyed I really hope it wasn't it
brushed his ones in the past and I'm
sorry this is new for me I'm gonna try
to slow it down as much as I can and I'm
about to catch up with all my of the
week so yeah I think guys so much for
