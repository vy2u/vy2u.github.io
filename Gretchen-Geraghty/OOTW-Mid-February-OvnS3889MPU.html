week for the middle of February and if
you guys have been keeping up with my
opted of the weeks you know that in
college it's been really hard for me to
like film them all in one week so that's
why this is just for outfits spread over
like a couple maybe two weeks because I
have some days in between where I
literally just talks about pants I don't
show those but anyway so this first day
my hair is wavy I don't know if I like
curled it or if it's just natural or
whatever I'm wearing my Tiffany necklace
my Tiffany bracelet I'm not wearing any
nail polish like this whole week I don't
think I wear any nail polish I've been
too lazy to paint my nails and then my
best is from forever 21 my white long
sleeve flowy shirt is from brandy
melville it's so comfy and like stretchy
and soft and then these new ish leggings
are the toasty tektites from the lemon
they're like my new favorite they're
just all black in like super warm and
then I'm wearing my chestnut tall UGG
boots that I got for Christmas and I
just roll them over because then they're
all fluffy okay then today I straighten
my hair and I'm wearing this white pea
coat that is for anyone believe it or
not I feel like it's super fancy looking
and I really like wearing it with more
like fancy outfits and if it's not too
too cold out because it doesn't keep me
that warm but um today I'm wearing some
eyeliner and mascara I feel like the
lighting was weird my face looked really
like washed out or something
but then oh I'm showing youtube I have a
lot of split ends and I'm gonna eat my
hair done before the next up of the week
so you'll see like I get highlights and
like a little trim and then my necklace
is from j.crew my top is from PacSun
it's just like a cropped like tan like
long sleeve shirt and then my black
high-waisted jeans are from Urban
Outfitters I love them and I've had
these guys forever if you guys have seen
my videos for a while and my black of
booties are from Steve Madden I'd
seriously wear those booties like every
day
today I curled my hair I'm wearing this
gold necklace that Taylor got me for
Christmas it's from Kate Spade and then
my gold bangles our Alex and Ani I feel
like my hair looks really long right
there yeah it's growing don't worry I
don't get that much cut off before the
next day of the week like only like a
tiny little trim I was wearing my black
Patagonia pea coat which is like really
soft and comfy that sweater is also
really old it's from brandy melville
it's just hand and black stripes and
then my dark wash of boyfriend jeans
from Abercrombie and these are my new
boots from Steve Madden that I showed at
my last fall video if you want to like
figure out where I got them I got them
from Zoo shoe but yeah you can just look
at my last haul video to see them like
the exact ones online and then today I
call my hair - and that necklace is from
a local boutique like back home I don't
know why I keep showing you my Tiffany
bracelet because I just never take it
off and that dress is really cool
because there's like a leather details
on it and if you can see I have a little
bit like brown like roots at the top but
