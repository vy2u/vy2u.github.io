outfit of the week and I'm so sorry I
know I've only been doing these videos
but I've had no time to do anything else
so this week is special there is 7
outfits and don't ask why it's really
just because I've had so many that I'm
just gonna put together so they're not
even really the real days but this is
Monday I have my long-term bag the tan
one that we'll see got me from France my
white jade address is from brandy
melville and my sweater is from brandy
melville I forget what it's called but
it's maroon my favorite sandals ever are
from Target so yeah that is what I wore
that day and that is my makeup I know
you guys asked for my makeup a lot so
it's just I don't know like eyeliner and
such okay so this day my hair is natural
which it usually is I have a black
v-neck from forever 21 I believe and my
shorts are really stretching you like
loose from brandy melville and I'm
wearing white bands that I wear all the
time
Wednesday my hair is natural again my
top is from brandy melville my bracelets
are just like miscellaneous I have like
light purple Essie nail polish that
shows up again later there's my dad I
have a sketch from brandy melville that
is floral and I believe I wear my vans
again yep so that is that okay
Thursday I love love love this outfit I
actually got in trouble and I look like
tan today I think I was sunny today
before it I was it was my hair is
straightened actually and I'm wearing a
white skirt from brandy melville and my
black crop top is from American Apparel
like I said I got in trouble the guy was
like your shirt just like to sort and I
was like sorry um my dad is also a long
chick bag but it's the black one at this
time and like I said I'm wearing my
eyeliner and can you believe it I
changed my earrings there are actually
gold little balls instead of my pearls
it was monumental to say the very least
alrighty so then on Friday I have my
blue pants from American Eagle my white
sweater is from Abercrombie and it's
really holy and just comfy cozy but I
like love these pants so much they're
jugging and they're really stretchy
and saw I was feeling that I feel like
spell almost that's a good way to be
able to describe them and then I have my
Sperrys that I really just worn out and
I wear them all the time
Saturday this really wasn't a Saturday
but you know uh-huh
my hair was like in braids I think so
it's kind of curly and I want foundation
so my skin looks better I just remember
I have my Tiffany necklace my nails are
just like a pinky red Essie color my
sweaters from Urban Outfitters and tor
screamin it was extremely corrupt as you
can see in my shorts I am in love with
they're high-waisted shorts that I got
at this boutique in like Costa Rica I
couldn't even tell you the name but I'm
obsessed with them my sandals are from
Target they're like black and strappy
and I wear those all the time as well so
that is what I wore that today this I
thought was fitting for Sunday because
my sweater I just thought screams Sunday
it's like a light purple um but it's
from j.crew and it kind of reminded me
of Grandma but it was comfy and I liked
it any much my light purple nails I'm
wearing this fairies and my top is from
Abercrombie and that is it I love you
all so much bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
