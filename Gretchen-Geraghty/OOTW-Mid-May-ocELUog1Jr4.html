week for the middle of May and I'm proud
of myself I'm catching up on these so
for Monday I'm actually wearing my hair
natural and it's just down I like it
usually is and I'm just wearing these
silver bracelets that I've been wearing
a lot recently they're like my everyday
go to some Alex and aunties
ones from other places that I'll go into
more depth later and there are some
blisters on my hands growing so sad but
I'm just wearing these rings from brandy
melville and most of them are from
brandy melville summer from like
American Eagle and I was just in a ring
kind of mood and also this week I
decided to tightline my eyes with black
eyeliner it's like gel eyeliner and I
really like that has been looking at
recently it's kind of more dramatic
looking but I don't know I just like the
way it looks and also I forgot to show
my lokai bracelet and that shirt is from
American Apparel
it's just his crop top and I'm wearing
lots of crop tops and I wasted shorts
this week I noticed but yeah I think
it's because it's starting to get hotter
out and those high-waisted shorts I
actually like DIY I think I made them in
like middle school they're like the
first pair I ever made just from like
first shop high waisted jeans that I cut
off and those shoes are those sandals
from Target and I showed you that it was
really sunny and I thought because I was
so excited it was so sunny out so yeah
that is all I wore on Monday okay for
Tuesday my hair is natural again and
it's kind of more wavy looking today and
you can see all that island I rewards
kind of a lot looking and look I was
really stressed because I had eight PS
that day and then my nails I just have
this French manicure and my tank top is
from brandy melville it's just this
muscle tank top and I'm also wearing a
bando underneath which is also from
brandy melville and they're just both
white and I actually forgot I had that
shirt so I didn't wear for a long time
but those shorts are also from brandy
melville it's just get really casual of
it because I literally had to say any
test for like five hours it was awful
and those leather sandals are from
American Eagle
ok so Wednesday I actually just got my
hair highlighted so I was like really
happy in there you can see it's awful on
no more roots um yeah I was just showing
you like literally like 10 minutes
before I film this I got my hair done so
that's why it's all fluffy looking and
again I tight line my
so lots of a dark eyeliner and look at
when I twist my hair like that it looks
also early because I have brown hair
underneath that necklace is from this
online boutique I showed it in a hall
recently and it's really springy looking
I don't wear like any bracelets just a
little hair tie and that dress you guys
have seen probably so many times it's
from forever 21 it's just this gray
t-shirt dress and it's super comfortable
and casual and I really like it a lot
probably one of my favorite dresses just
because it's so versatile it's a little
bit short problems of being like five
eight but you know I try my best
and then my shoes are just these white
converse and at them a lot they're what
I've been wearing a lot recently more
than my bands because my bands are
getting kind of old so I really like it
a lot ok Thursday I'm wearing more crop
tops in high-waisted shorts and my hair
is like more wavy looking I've been
writing a lot natural
yeah there's Ozzie you guys saw him in
my last outfit of the week and some of
you were saying that he looks like a
horse and you know he really does he's
just this huge big Great Dane and I
still calm a puppy even though clearly
not a puppy he's just my little snuggle
buddy and he likes to be the center of
attention so he likes to always come in
when I'm done my outfit into me but like
I said I'm wearing that same eyeliner
you look and then I'm gonna elephant
necklace which you guys can find at
Nordstrom you ask a lot just enough for
me like that I would say that but just
you know that turquoise ring is from
brandy melville and those silver ones
are from American Eagle and I just have
same a French manicure on my nails and
that one all the way to the right is my
Tiffany bracelet and then it goes my
bracelet from Abercrombie and then that
one metric a bangle is from Kate Spade
and then the other two are out tsunami
that's at the st. Christopher one and
then that one's my feather one which is
like my favorite and I also want my
pearl earrings case you're wondering bag
never come out and then that maroon crop
top is from brandy melville it's just
like a tank top I feel like I wear lots
of brain dural of this weakness
most of my wardrobe is from there let's
be real and then those shorts are also
from reading Melville they're just like
as technique print and I also showed you
I wore that big cream sweater from it
you can guess it brandy Melville but I
didn't show it on cuz they were that
like pull her out and it was just like a
really comfy and casual outfit and
that's base to it I wear when I can't
figure out what to wear is a good crop
top in short and those sandals aren't
from Packers mom be another knot or from
Target lol why does itah and then my
hair is just highlighted like I was
showing you I just kept showing you
okay Friday I'm wearing like a similar
outfit that I wore on Thursday it's just
another crop top and I rejoice and
they're both from brandy melville you
can guess it and my arse actually well I
think as I showered in the morning time
so it's kind of fluffy looking again and
then my necklaces are just these silver
necklaces that are layered from Urban
Outfitters I really like those things
are cute and I don't know how I didn't
get yelled at for that outfit showed so
much for my stomach's is that black
cop-out brandy melville is pretty crop
and literally look at my hairs like a
lion mane in the morning after I wash it
but yeah thank you so much for watching
and I'll see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
