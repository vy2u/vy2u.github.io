Kingsman 2 with my family but wait first
I want to show you guys my blush from
NARS exploded in my makeup bag like a
look at that so all of my things are
covered in pink flesh actually no it
didn't explode this when I fall I've
dropped it a million times and this
doesn't even stay on anymore like look
at the top just yeah all the pieces
finally fell out and went over
everything and now we I'm really sad
because wait do you letting migraine
that's so funny so when I came to
college this year actually stole my
blackout curtains from my room back home
so every time I come home I hang up a
blanket as curtains isn't that funny
but hey I just stopped by and I always
forget to blog with your like Anna is
literally my best friend of all time but
like I don't know what it is I think
when we're together there's always
something to talk about so we're always
so busy talking that like I never even
think like oh I have to blogger like oh
my god I get a picture with her
something it's like our memories aren't
captured very often like we have very
few pictures together for like how close
to friends we are which sucks but um see
I didn't even walk with her but she got
me these jeans guys for Christmas oh my
gosh I'm really this is so embarrassing
this is like all the stuff I got for
Christmas but I got to show you the
jeans so these jeans are just from
fashion Nova she said and she's been
telling me forever that I need to try
the fashion of a jeans and I actually
reminded me of a Brooke meteo here in
new to you because I love her and she
was always telling you how great the
fashion Imogene's are but
like never ever tried them and they're
literally so soft and so stretchy and so
great and handles like they're so
flattering and they are and I love them
I was like there's no way this size is
gonna fit me and they fit perfect so I'm
obsessed with these and like I would so
recommend I've had them on for like five
minutes and we're ready like my new fave
jeans so thank you so much and I love
you I can't wait to see you when we come
back from Stratton and yeah I gotta
clean up my room as you can see that it
augments because I'm behind and this is
the last day this is the conclusion I
want to apologize really quick because I
don't say I slacked this year on vlogmas
but i slack because here on vlogmas like
you guys know how behind I've been with
uploads and I feel like years past I've
been like even more busy than this year
and I'm still like on time with upload
so I'm really sorry I think I can only
attribute it to the fact that like
finals were so crazy this year with core
being in Paris and traveling and stuff
obviously it's really hard to upload
then and like Wi-Fi issues and such so
yeah that is that but thank you guys so
much for joining me this year on blogs I
had so much fun at capturing on my
memories thank you for spending
Christmas today with me it was really
great
my family's watching atomic blonde
downstairs I was just watching with them
but actually watch on the plane coming
up it's a really good movie by the way
it's very like thrilling like my
adrenaline was like pumping moles I'm on
the plane anyway I'm getting off track
thank you guys so much for watching and
I'll see you next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
