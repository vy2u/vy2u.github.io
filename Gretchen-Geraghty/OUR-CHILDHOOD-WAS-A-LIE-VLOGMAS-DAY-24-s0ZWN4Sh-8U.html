I don't know what stories of yours are
fake or true or embellished you're like
Sasha Sasha has these like elaborate
stories and everyone's like we don't
even believe him okay long story short
tell me what I'm saying things wrong
okay a great grandmother's wedding ring
and fell off into the lake when he was
fishing and then five years later 20
years later there's no way this is real
he was fishing in the same link any fish
to fish boom and then they went back
because they brought it back and they're
gonna eat it hey check out an item any
cut into the fish and it hit something
hard and guess what it was like please
put water off the wedding ring and
you're like the bottom of the lake huh
yeah like everything we learned our
childhood was a lie
you things but like certain things that
Lucy and I knew to be true we're just
not how it was but we just thought it
was it's like we thought
chapstick was kiss kiss until I was
probably 14 cranking forever and finally
one day at school I was like steady
nobody kisses like my lips are so
chapped and they're like what in the
heck are you talking about because we
always call that kiss kiss and you guys
just went along with us in it hair
pretties we have we always draw hair

them hair pretties oh my gosh and we
this was actually the worst ever I told
all my friends for him that we had a
lollipop tree in our backyard

forgot about it till just now I told all
my friends elementary school to be able
Ollie pop tree in our backyard you know

do like it's magical it grows a lot of
hops because everyone's know every day I
would come home from school and I would
run to the backyard and look at the
local tree but only once in a while
I pop some tape to the tree like tannish
times that like it's been that you use
like art class what is that called
no but not masking cuz that's like duct
tape isn't it or maybe it is math yeah

that was the tape that you always had in
your crotch but we were like so we were
like oh it like grew from the branches
