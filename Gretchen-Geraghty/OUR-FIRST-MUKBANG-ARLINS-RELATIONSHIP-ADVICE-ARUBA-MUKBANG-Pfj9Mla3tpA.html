this is my first math class
so bear with me tell me what we're
supposed to do and see how much I wish
we had questions to answer you can see
them I have two hard-boiled eggs two
pancakes
cantaloupe grapes and pineapple
and I have
I know bacon I have bread with like
different types of jelly some potatoes
banana some fruit and I put salsa on the
side because crazy gracefully
yeah you actually do you make me like
them more
last night we went to a steak house last
night and we are like really good steak
and really good Wow yep you've never
been to Ruth's Chris Steakhouse whenever
I think of this cake I just think of
your metaphor relationship advice guys
ready lift in right now you know when
you like like somebody and am I just
compilations well most people develop
crushes on other people and sometimes
they like
go on a date and maybe they hits
the next day a lot of people time to
wake up and they can't stop thinking
about it
and I can't stop thinking about that
person and like does that person like
them back
what does it mean are they gonna start
dating are they are they gonna leave
them for someone else why aren't they
texting them back so they take something
first all these questions and they end
up spending like the rest of the next
day even like the next week
sometimes even weeks or months thinking
about one person and again and what they
should do to move forward and so I came
across this analogy called the steak
analogy wait you didn't make it up I
just I just like very to someone what
are you basically in the copier
everyone's a pop here I'm kidding come
here
people ChromeOS Alexis Rafi
and the steak analogy is that when you
have a nice steak like we did last night
you enjoy the steak while you're eating
it
you enjoy the flavors of the sage you
digest it feels really good and then the
next day you wake up do not like what's
my steak doing right is my steak enough
am I gonna see my steak again what am I
gonna have steak again
my city I miss my street you just wake
up and you have like a different state
or maybe like eggs like this and you
don't even so the point is you should
enjoy people when you're with that you
shouldn't spend too much time thinking
about what they're doing you should just
be yourself and just love life and yeah
that's it Emmet
the New York girl Marlene learned on
this trip that could have so many
emotions like this and girls mothers
like this but we just steal things up
under trends more than boys Jason
these potatoes are really good I don't
think they have them the other days
every way you guys are something
tell me right like really be and saw
yeah but guys kind of sound
Maggie's not right here right now but I
would say this to her too but for some
reason like these past couple days I've
actually felt like I'm an only child
actually felt like you guys were like my
sisters you're like another brother to
me I know every day we go like our
brother I had this guy in my life right
we went to California right you may know
us each other happy California we went
to Boston
he'd get mad and be like Harlan send me
screenshots of my blog where like I like
on my arm around your something and
you'd be like mad and I was like okay I
was like my brother didn't literally
I wasn't enough the boys are acceptance
and really think that they can control
your life
I know boys are controlling
that guy's you'll because outside school
really like guys with hope things like
what to wear but they can't wear and
that's just like you know a big loser
thank classic friends have you know
that's yeah
I like this is love advice from Harlan
meet you like I do I need like the hard
truth
do you guys know me have any questions
hopeless romantic
anything
in your opinion actually no I know what
you're gonna say because I know there
are guys that do but I feel like there's
no guys in college at want like
relationships it's like they've all
stopped or like they like be nice and
then like will disappear or like I don't
know there's good guys in college it's
like
but then I know there are some guys that
like to love it like I was in joshing
like you don't mean like you see that
you like what's girlfriend but like I
don't know I think so many guys just
like don't about Burrell in college yeah
so what is the question like do that are
there I'm doing this some like really do
yeah I'd like 22 million so wait what's
the question I don't know like why are
guys the way they are in college because
they just want to like chill and have
fun yes
I think people like contradict
themselves a lot and say they want
something but they end up doing and
acting a completely different way I mean
girls are guilty of it too yeah
they're like like oh I want like a
boyfriend like you know who like loves
me and appreciates me nothing you see
like so many girls dating assholes and
it's like why do they did assholes why
don't they just date a nice guy yeah and
it just doesn't work like that yeah but
so like there's there's definitely a
pool of got like nice guys slash
assholes somewhere in the middle and I
love to say dr. Jerrold yeah
no I mean like
but yeah I heard an interesting thing
the other day
women of mothers raise their boys
to be met right yeah but not no it
doesn't stop there
mothers raise their boys to be the men
that they would want to date so the
thing is like
mothers raise their boys be the men they
want to date and now not the boys that
they would want today if they were 19
yeah I want my voice to be much players
hockey then I want to play hockey
lacrosse I want them to be tan I want
the hair to be like kind of like their
skin to be just married and how do you
walk up to actor our girls yeah okay
gentlemen yeah yeah and I want them to
be smart and I want them to open up the
door for girls just imagine how many
guys ask them on a date over text is
they're too nervous to ask her because
that was me guys if any you guys will
watch that I was too scared to ask the
pretty girl in high school in person
and then I learned that you have and
then I learned if you do it in person
it's must be you text the air DM me and
I'm like God some kid asked me I went on
my first day to share he asked me or
attack asking for even if I didn't like
the person cuz they did it in person and
I would be like good for you you know
what you say
what's your relationship advice wait for
me
just hook up with a girl yeah like girls
the first time you mean I always I don't
either
ok I can't give anyone my system so
about that like I'm so funny like I
am the one that misses the snake for
eight years so but I feel like girls
just want guys like I want a guy good
luck with guarding and like different
like not like you know all the other
guys I just hook up with girls there's a
guy that wants a relationship and like
when guys will doors for me I'll go
notice oh I got a pea oh yeah like so my
guy friends like I'll just notice like
they like always hold the door like are
things over the network or something or
they like let you go first
like I notice that stuff like a walk
yeah girls always do I
that's so true God
now I make me think of like everything
in me too I want to be married yesterday
oh my god
haven't done
I also have another theory about girls
girls want you guys bizarre you guys
watching girls want guys to do well
they're rooting for the guy and often
you don't have to do a lot but you just
screw it up I do it a bunch of dumb
weird stuff so pretty in-depth theory
but seriously girls are rooting for you
they want you to be like cool but the
main thing that happens is guys get
weird and do weird weird stuff like
I don't know what are some weird things
guys have done to try to impress you
like when guys like a girl then they
just act super weird I feel like when
guys trying to like me
well I try to be me there's I don't
really mature like still in college like
will be mean to girls if they like you
know what I feel like when you're like
young that's up to say maybe like the
girl you've been like
or
the guy in personnel just like act like
idiots we'd be like you bit we're gonna
try to show off yeah and then they still
look down like there's two one Cana I
remember with a freshman or sophomore
year it was sophomore year of sophomore
year you played on the football and you
would like purposely after a game or
like it just did this to try the lake
impress me or like others like you would
take his jersey and you like literally
fold it up to here am i my friend was
like what the hell are you doing why are
you doing that I'm just you know
this is your channel right but I'm with
you girls I need I need advice - how do
you get a boyfriend how do you get boys
to like yeah
I'm most probably not gonna have a
boyfriend until she's like 18 because
all the guys in high score going to
nervous all the guys who aren't gonna be
nervous to stand up to her like no yeah
you're probably gonna date like when you
get to college you'll probably date like
a junior or senior probably like
or you can voyage and I liked all other
guys you'll probably honestly date a guy
in a crap for a little bit brat you know
you'll probably do the guy in a frat for
a little bit date and then you'll
probably date an athlete
hi there first or second you'll date
both you think that Brad guy and the
athletes probably hockey player but
prepared me you'll realize that the
hockey players like a little bit
socially awkward because he's like
playing hockey all the time
you'll probably married
Oh
I can't go out all right now on to
Gretchen Gretchen if you want a
boyfriend soon stop doing it you're
doing we need to stop saying that you're
hopeless
because whatever you yes it's so true
whatever you're sad but every other
boyfriend you more looking for them like
they just like show us then raise your
looking for them they're like yeah it's
like people who don't have money always
walk around saying I'm broke I'm broke
and then they don't make any money
because they just think they're broke
mm-hmm so if you just like you should
walk around like oh I have a boyfriend I
have a boyfriend but definitely don't
say like I'm hopeless
is it about you know I hope they got a
kick out of all this would I just say
guys I love it which way do you know I
want more this potato dobrik done to a
guy for nine months and even asked me
out once
yeah weird cuz he was nervous why
yeah he was nervous
nervous immature scared of heartbroken
hard
god you're so scared of rejection yeah
they really are but it's like shoot your
shot you know
you learn through failure that's a good
one for everybody across the board
I am learned so if you're a girl you're
like why is this guy asking me out why
don't you ask him out and then if he
rejects you then you'll know to never
ask however again yeah but I think if
I've been asked out I definitely can
have said
yeah be like a lot of I feel like a lot
of the advice I would give is like too
straightforward for this talk it's like
- like Blanc you're very like to the
point that like that's good if you're
like don't be psycho I'm like
sugarcoating a lot of stuff right now
yeah like don't care about a person they
use different words they're the state
that's what you guys need to a lot of
you are probably waiting around maybe
we'll do a Q&amp;amp;A Leah have the questions
in the comments in the next video we do
together yeah we can do it and all it'll
be like guy advice for girls and then we
can do it on my channel that's girl
