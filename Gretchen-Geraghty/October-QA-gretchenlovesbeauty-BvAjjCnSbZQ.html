channel and they were like Christian
what are you talking about
hi everyone I like never get my hair I
don't really know hey everyone so today
I'm filming a question and answers video
and I'm so excited to be doing this
video for you because I know I haven't
filmed a video in a very very long time
I know like everyone just gives these
excuses but I've been so so easy with
school look I can't even tell you like
junior year is probably a hundred times
harder than I thought it would be
balancing it with crew and like a social
life that I currently don't have because
I'm just trying to like balance
everything so it's been like really hard
but I just wanted to film this video
because I know I haven't like sat down
and talked to you guys in a long time
and I just want to like talk to the
camera I want to put up videos that you
guys want to see so comment below videos
that you want to see like okay I already
know you guys really really like outfit
of the week video so I'm gonna be trying
to film those as much as possible but my
outfits haven't been that good like I've
been wearing a lot of yoga pants and
such and stuff it's added that is I've
been looking like a bomb I try to wear
like better outfits in the upcoming week
so I can have some good after the week
videos and yeah I think that addresses
everything so people just get them to
question how many blue sweatshirts do
you own um I really couldn't tell you
out of the sweatshirt that I do have our
blue or like navy blue so maybe a
majority of them are blue I'd say if you
were a superhero what powers would you
have I would like to fly because that
would just be really cool
talk about crew I really want to start
I'm in eighth grade for those of you
that don't know it's like you're rowing
in a boat but it's really competitive
it's definitely a sport at my school
it's considered like a club I think it's
because you have to like pay for it so
it's not just like a normal school sport
that you like just do its look expensive
with all the equipment and everything
like that
like your rowing in a boat and there's
like shoes in the boat that your feet go
on and there's like a slide II like
seeds sculling is with like two oars so
you're rowing in either a quad or a
double or a single and then sweeping is
like when you just hold two hands on one
or
like on either starboard or port and
that's in like an eight or a four or a
pick a really good workout if you didn't
know what you're doing it kind of is
hard to like learn how to row like i'm
when i first started rolling I wasn't
really good but once you look at the
hang of it it's good and then you a
trace on what are called regattas
they're just like crew boat races and if
you know crew you know exactly what I'm
talking about like if you row or you
like know some that does crew look
different than every other sport I'd say
there's so much more behind it like you
really have to like like how you row is
like dependent upon how hard you try and
how much you train to put a lot into it
to get a lot out of it
so that's why I always have crew
practice and there's like earning which
is like the indoor rowing machines and
that gets really like intense like
colleges will I compare your to Kate I'm
so that's like really like something I
hope to improve on like my - Kate I'm I
yeah yeah I don't really know what it's
going you could just see what like
opportunities for rowing there are in
your area if you think you'd be
interested like it's just really fun if
you're like strong and you're willing to
like put in the work it could be really
great and then you can Relic in college
and there's like all sorts of
opportunities so yeah I would definitely
suggest like trying rowing because it's
really fun and I love it a lot and then
my sister and I will grow
tomorrow afternoon hold on and double
and then we'll go and eat as well in the
morning for our high school yeah I
really like growing a lot yeah you
haven't noticed next one is how did you
grow your hair so long and how did it
tell him to take you in tip it was like
I'd say it's like my bellybutton it's
actually shorter because it's all curled
but maybe a little past my bellybutton
because my belly was right there um yeah
it's pretty long and honestly I know
you're supposed to get your hair cut
like once a month and that supposed to
make it healthier and let it like grow
longer but I like never get my hair cut
so that I didn't the last time I got it
cut it was that beauty of our channel
it's October I've honestly like realized
like if your hair is like healthy like
don't cut it because that's like what
makes your hair short like if you're
cutting it all the time like it's not
gonna grow like I don't know I just
don't cut it that much so I would say
frame them cutting it as much as
possible and try not to use heat on it
that much but I haven't been putting
heat on it like that much
and so it's like tips and honestly it
just takes time like you have to be
patient that's really all it takes like
I haven't cut significantly like like
portions of my hair off for a long time
so I just keep letting it to grow and
maybe it'll get even longer I hope I
like long hair so I'm just never gonna
cut my hair ever what would you do if
you win the lottery I don't know it's a
really good question
oh I don't keep some to my family yeah
I'd like I'd like split it up among my
family and friends and then they'd like
me what's the furthest you've been on
holiday oh this person was feed from
like Europe or something um I think the
farthest I've gone would be Mexico like
Cancun Mexico we go there with our
family we went like twice and I think
that's the part that I've ever gone I
love it there like if you can go
anywhere go to Cancun Mexico it's really
nice and warm and fun so oh yeah that's
the farthest I've been will you or do
you have a pl box oh I don't have one
and I've never actually thought about it
it would be fun to get one maybe I will
get one if you want me to get a PA box
comment below
good suddenly stuff but I don't want to
get if you guys have a P o box like send
me stuff cuz I don't want you to have to
like send me stuff I don't know I guess
well actually that would be cool if you
want to like send me letters and stuff
because that's like you know more
personal than like messages or emails or
something so maybe I will yeah comment
below if you want me to get a few box
that would be fun how do you stay fit
yes I love you in your gorgeous oh thank
you okay I I just stay fit honestly from
rolling and like we have crew practice
every single day and we actually used to
work out before school in the morning we
don't morning work out so I'm just like
honestly I'm like exercising all the
time so I pretty much eat like whatever
I want which is like so bad I eat like
not really healthy but uh I think I kind
of get away with it just because I work
out so much so yeah I just stay fit by
like growing and we do we do a lot of
training like before school we would
lift weights we would run we would earn
me too
like cardio and stuff so there's always
workouts you can do maybe if you look
can't go to a gym or look not a part of
a team you can always like workout so
yeah there's just like a lot you can do
I made a fitness video that I will link
in the downbar um stuff that I do when
I'm like not rowing yeah I win my
fitness video below so you can see more
about that where do you want to live and
what do you want to do when you're older
I think I like there and now like I'm in
New York State I will just say that I
don't see like the time I Love New York
City but I want to be close enough to
the city where I can just like go for
the day and like my cousin lives in Long
Island so maybe that would be cool to
live in Long Island because she's not
that far from the city or like New
Jersey or something but yeah so maybe
somewhere around there and what do you
want to do like what do I want to be
maybe I really am interested in like
science and like the medical field so
maybe like an orthodontist or something
this one says favorite stores besides
Brandi um that one sorry but well this
shirt is from Topshop
so I like that who wants to be in my
video
she was in my um what's it called
Christmas all the video if you guys saw
that but she's not actually my pop she's
my cousin's book that's visiting oh yeah
oh yeah oh yeah yeah so I like Topshop
American Apparel describe myself as an
animal I would say no I'd like to be
dolphin or maybe no elephant that'd be
fun do you get heat at your school from
YouTube so much no like knowing actually
I don't think people like hate I think a
lot of people kind of talk about it or
maybe are too scared to talk to me about
it but um there's not like one person at
my school it doesn't know about my
YouTube videos like everyone knows I
don't think I get hate but you can't
have a YouTube channel without people
knowing like
that doesn't happen everyone will know
if you have a youtube channel at your
school like everyone know about trust
like people find that have you ever been
to Canada yes I went over the summer for
rowing and it was so much fun and I
absolutely loved it and it was really
nice there so I love Canada
are you going to Los Angeles I Maxim
January I love you I wish I could go but
I'm not planning on going plus he knows
is really far away because I live in New
York so yeah I don't really think that
happening but that would be really fun
if I could go if you were a chair who
would you want to sit on you know can
you make a brandy melville collection
video I don't know with people get
really mad and I talk about brand name a
lot so probably not only because I know
all the comments will be angry at me so
I probably won't meet one of those like
I do have a lot of clothes from that but
I don't see that too happening 1
megabyte up for the rest of your life
what would you use in what to brand um I
would say I would use mascara because I
think that looks like you look the most
put together if you were in mascara and
my favorite mascara ever is the L'Oreal
telescopic corner ladies that what's
your favorite part about having a twin
sister I absolutely love having to
insist her name is Lucy she's been in my
videos before it's really fun just like
always having a built-in friend I know
if that sounds weird but she's like also
my best friend but like whenever we'd go
somewhere new or going to new school
like I've always had someone so it's
really nice having a twin sister and I
like when we get along and recently
you've been getting along very well so
she's like my best friend
and I don't know honestly I have no idea
where I'd be without Lucy yeah I am I
really like having a twin it's great how
about you I'm 16 years old makeup
collection video this has been very
requested for a very long time too and I
think I will end up doing one one day
right now my makeup isn't really like
organized the way I like it if it's kind
of just like all thrown into my vanity
like it's all kind of like messed up and
disorganized but maybe someday I will do
one relationship status well I have a
friend so yeah in one event in your life
what would it be
this is a very deep emotion if I could
change one thing it would have honestly
probably be to start YouTube sooner
because I started YouTube like my
freshman year and now I'm a junior and I
think it would have been better to even
start it in like seventh or eighth grade
so if you're thinking about making a
YouTube channel like go for it
like I would definitely recommend it
because it's really fun
and I like it a lot do you use heat on
your hair every day and I really haven't
been using heat on my hair looked that
much at all just only really today it
for school I'll either braid it at
nighttime or just leave it natural
because my hair naturally it's pretty
straight so I just like to leave it like
that do you want makeup everyday uh yeah
I do like um over the summer I like
wouldn't wear makeup that much at all
this is just a good animal video this is
my dog all right boo just animals love
me yeah over this summer I didn't wear
makeup that much at all and I was about
to actually make like how I cleared my
skin video because everyone was asking
me because my skin looked so much better
without makeup any step like struggle
with acne a lot and then recently my
skin is been getting over really bad
again you can't tell because I like
covered it up makeup I think it's just
like over the summer my skin is really
good because of the Sun and now that the
Sun isn't like clearing it up it just
gets bad again so yeah I do our makeup
every day because I have to cover up all
my pimple if you could dye your hair a
crazy color what would it be
purple favorite staple piece of clothing
would probably be a like long company
sweater because in the fall I always
just I wear like a sweater over like any
outfit every day like this I could just
Darwin like any like wrong like cardigan
so probably just like a comfy sweater or
cardigan how do you keep your body so
fit I said that before like um I just
workout with all the time so I won't did
you blow like I said well i shadow car
looks best on you well today I'm gonna
eyeshadow and I don't wear eyeshadow
that much but it's like a tan one my
friend Erin says what is your favorite
subject math by far other hobbies
besides YouTube would be growing because
I read all the time so crew what is the
farthest you will travel for crew
I would travel anywhere for crew but
like realistically the farthest we've
gone the farthest I've gone would be
Canada we went to Henley over the summer
so that was really fun
do you ever think you would come this
far with YouTube and no I didn't I
honestly just started it because I
thought it looked cool and I never knew
like all the opportunities it would
bring me and everything so I don't never
even saw this as a like as a possibility
so everything that's happened because of
YouTube has really been like great for
me I could love it would you ever like
to model and I mean yeah like modeling
would be really fun but you have to be
really really skinny to be a model and I
don't think skinny enough like that
people are gonna like hate me for saying
that like I'm not fat tomorrow you need
to be like a twig this one says but do
your parents think about YouTube my
parents are like totally supportive I
remember I was so scared to like tell
them that I maybe you dude okay this is
really bad too
if you want to make an YouTube channel
ask your parents first because I just
like did it for a month and then I told
my parents I was like hey guys I have a
YouTube channel and they were like
Christian what are you talking about so
definitely ask your parents if you can
make one first because my parents were
kind of like what are you talking about
yeah I just made one and then like told
them so it's kind of bad but my parents
are totally supportive and they love it
and they think it's great
do your friends think your YouTube is a
weird job my closest friends
like I think totally understand it like
they know where I'm coming from like my
best friend Hannah was one that actually
had got me into it because she always
watched him so she totally understands
and like Marissa and like they totally
like they watch YouTube videos they like
know what it's like but some of my
friends I don't think really get it or
like know why I do it and it's really
just like a fun thing I like it a lot so
I think some people don't really
understand like where you're coming from
and they don't really know why like if
some people think it's weird they just
don't understand but that's okay so yeah
so my friend thinks it's weird but like
it doesn't really bother me and my kids
at my school don't understand but like
if they want to know more they can just
talk to you about it and I think most
people think it's cool if they kind of
like make fun of it but like what are
you gonna do like I don't care how do
you manage school crew and YouTube
honestly it's so
like it seems to be so are that's why I
haven't put up a video and so long and
my grades are way lower than they should
be and crew like like physically just
keeping up and like not getting enough
sleep like it's really so hard but you
just have to like focus as hard as you
can and really try like I don't really
know what else to say like it's really
hard but I just have to like push
through I'm trying my best
I have bad days and I have good days you
know you please do a room tour um maybe
someday well right now man I was kind of
messy not really how I wanted to but
maybe somebody most embarrassing moment
in school Oh
freshman year in English class my foot
got stuck under the desk and the bell
rang and I was the first one to get up
and I got up and I like screams because
as I was like walking I was trying to
like walk in my seat and I found I hit I
had on the chalkboard and like I'm not
even kidding my friend wasn't across the
room Sara she like point at me and she
started laughing and everyone was
pointing at me and laughing I'm not
kidding it was like awful and we had a
student teacher and she was laughing at
me too and I was like whoa it was like
it was so bad and I just kept my head
but I guy was okay but I like kind of
like yelped I was like god it was who is
so embarrassed I go and I tripped down
the stairs all the time I'm really
clumsy person current TV obsession
Grey's Anatomy if you don't watch it I'm
judging you watch it what is your shoe
size I'm 1/8 I mean I didn't even have a
taint everything if you're running late
in the morning what is your go-to
hairstyle I will usually either braid it
on the side or I'll just leave it
natural because that's what I do like
everyday so whatever what do you feel
has been the best thing that has
happened to you this year hmm what's
yours been pretty tough with like grades
and I don't really know I've like gotten
close with some people and I had my
first boyfriend so that is good his name
is Justin
I'll make him be in a video someday so
yeah the best thing that's happening
this year would definitely be Justin
because yeah he's really nice
what are you doing you're in a bad mood
it's just so bad usually I'm in a bad
mood I'm just like mean to my family and
they get mad at me it's pretty bad but I
oh when I'm in a bad mood out to eat a
bunch of junk food and then it makes me
feel worse and then I just like hate
myself and I'm like so what am i
productive that I would do is maybe if I
just like go to sleep don't like make me
feel better
I just like go to sleep and try not to
think about it I don't know I'm not good
at like coping with bad things he said
you love me to snatch and you mean my
day oh and this is so cute um so those
he don't know I like made a youtube
snapchat and it's GLP aut why I like GL
beauty and my friend actually made it
for Armenia and it was kind of a good
joke at first like I was like oh like I
don't want to get too attached at but it
was so cool like I didn't realize like I
get snapchats from people all over the
world and it's so cool like seeing you
guys from like Belgium and like the UK
like Australia so um yeah I definitely
snapchat me Geo beauty and I will try to
snapchat you back look I get a bunch but
I will try my best because I think it's
so cool I love talking to you guys it's
the best what are your favorite videos
to film really look book videos in like
outfit videos because those are my
favorite to watch I think so yeah after
the weeks and stuff are kind of fun I
like those
what grade are you in next school I'm
gonna lemon created I'm in my junior
year do you have a boyfriend yes you
will be in a video I'll make it what
something unique about yourself love you
well whenever anyone asked me I'm always
like I would spit when people that don't
know me if you guys know what to it just
something unique would be hmm I have no
idea
well YouTube's unique me having a twin
is unique but you guys know that mmm I
don't know
I don't know are you is he older um Lucy
divide me by a minute are you planning
on rowing in college I would love to bro
in college like honestly I've left on
college I love rowing but growing in
college is like really really
competitive like if you go to vision one
you need to be like that six foot two
like 200-pound rower that will like win
the Olympics which like isn't me because
I'm only five eight so yeah I would love
Troy division but no but there is
lightweight rowing which I might do but
you can't get a scholarship for
lightweight really but I think that's
what I'm gonna end up doing because
Division one like opened my rowing is
like so intense and I'm not even really
competitive in that field because I'm
not big enough how tall are you
I said I'm 5/8 um my friend Andrea says
are there any people in your life that
you let slip through your fingers and
you don't see them over the summer and
is that person begin to have separation
anxiety
wants to see you yes Andrea Joyce I love
you guys and I miss you so much
they're my friends that we see like
every summer and we didn't see them last
summer and I miss them a lot
and yeah I gotta see you guys soon so
bye hey what's my favorite snack healthy
snack would probably be like berries
like Lucy me burn like blackberries or
the corrals berries or strawberries or
blueberries just cool like everyday and
a healthy would probably be like those
peanut butter cookies but they're
Hershey Kisses on top because you make
them all the time in our actually though
to make them right now um so yeah but my
healthy one would be like business its
first kiss that my first kiss was
actually over this past summer because
yeah it was pretty late on the sixteen
we're not gonna get into that
whoo Danny Brent says is Justin gonna be
in any of your upcoming videos hopefully
he was gonna be in this video but then
he didn't want to so whatever
can you do meet and greet in Florida I
don't think so I hope they've in Florida
so that would be kind of
and I live in New York yeah sorry if you
could try one anywhere in the world the
way or would it be probably Australia I
know that's kind of weird but it's only
because Australia is only the other side
of the world so that would be really
cool like who doesn't want to go to
Australia
you know what inspired you to do YouTube
and please say hi Rachel hi Rachel and
what inspired me to do you - I think
I've answered this probably 100 times no
probably so sick of me hearing it but he
definitely be my friend Hannah and she
just like showed me YouTube videos one
day and I was like what is that like
that's a weird but then I was like these
are so cool like I want to do it so that
I started making them yes what classes
are you taking this here um - I mean
just like what come here Mike Scott -
okay first period I have English English
Lebanon is just like normal English and
then second period
I've honours physics and then third I
have financial decision-making fourth I
have Spanish if I have a push which is
just like AP US history that's fun class
I actually do like history a lot sixth I
have crap which is really nice yesterday
Shh I left school and I went to Dunkin
Donuts and that's actually against the
rules and I was so scared I was going to
suspend it but it was all good because I
made it back and then sevens I have free
calc which Maggie is my favorite subject
and like I still love math but it's just
really hard to keep my grades up this
year what is your favorite eyeliner
would definitely be the steel waterproof
marker eyeliner if I'm wearing it right
now and I wear it every day were you and
Lucy identical before you dyed your hair
no we're not identical twins were
fraternal but we looked way more like
with brown hair and a lot of people have
actually told me that they couldn't tell
us apart and I had brown hair which is
weird but we weren't identical we just
looked more like how long did it take
you to grow up your hair
I just haven't cut it
long time thank you so much for watching
and I will see you in one of my next
videos it will probably be a outfit of
the week or something of that sort so I
