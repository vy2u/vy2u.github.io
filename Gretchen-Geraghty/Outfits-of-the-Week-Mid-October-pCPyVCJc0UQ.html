color it is shirt from brandy melville
but it's really like soft flowy and then
I have my tan bag and some gold and
silver Alex I'm outies and some cream
lace shorts from brandy melville and
then my sandals are these white sandals
with like rose great skulls I think from
Jeffrey Campbell and yeah that's
obviously a pretty warm outfit cuz this
was like beginning middle of October so
it was still pretty warm and I wasn't
wearing me up cause I don't think I am
this full week already so then I'm
Tuesday I'm wearing the same exact
necklace just the silver one um my hair
I think I straightened all week long
because I decided that it looks a longer
one and straight so yeah there's me
pulling in my dress there's Taylor my
PFS Taylor um yeah I had to pull my
dress because I don't have boobs stoled
it up and it's new and it's from
Abercrombie and that Jackie you've
probably seen a Julian times is from
brandy melville it just goes with
everything and it's like army green and
yeah that dresser is like strapless or
whatever because it was still pretty hot
out but there's Taylor again she comes
over at all times or curve practice um
but yeah those are my combat boots from
Steve Madden and I was on the phone with
my dad because he hates to come already
then on Wednesday look I look pretty tan
I think it's just because when I wear
like a lot of bronzer so I don't get
pale in the winter months that's why
I've heard lots of project alright um I
wear my Tiffany necklace and my shirt is
from Billabong I think I really like it
a lot I like the red light

from ever coming and those are my vans
which are getting pretty gross and
smelly and nasty and I have way too much
fun filming these up in two weeks -
guess I danced around like a child um
yeah that's what I want that day and
surprise surprise guys I have a little
secret I haven't gotten to like a full
like five days of school in a row yet so
that's why there's only four this week
because I don't know at school Monday
through Thursday um my shirt is from
PacSun I love it tell me it's not the
cutest shirt you've ever seen it so
freaking cute and then my pants are oh
