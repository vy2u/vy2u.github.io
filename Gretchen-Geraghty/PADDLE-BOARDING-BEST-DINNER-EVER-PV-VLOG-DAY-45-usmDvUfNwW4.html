I'm gonna be vacuuming tomorrow meet you
they keep being like sign in the morning
and then we come at it like one let's
just do it
I'll go like whenever you want today I
literally will go like right now like
okay so shit shit I would bring my phone
but is that a bad idea I would bring
this thing and this thing would be in
the bottom of the freaking ocean is that
a mariachi band or something else
yeah ah it makes me happy I like that
really it's probably like really sweet
Wow is it like warm now it's cold
ooh cuz I felt like by him walking
around the Sun with them that it would
be like hot but I like cold GC warrant
cold you see warming up cold juicy like
sweet mango I want to do that banana
boat too
I really want to do it so there's my I
wanted to show you first I saw there was
like tie pasta with vegetables and I was
like young and then I saw my chicken
nuggets and I was like okay we're on
vacation
and then literally I just saw like
random iceberg lettuce and cucumber and
I think it's was feeling toppings we're
like a hamburger but I'm gonna be eating
with my fingers right now yeah I didn't
need vegetables Lisburn
how nobody showed them this cute little
like eating spot where we eat it's cute
guys and there's old lights unfair to
the time okay I wanted to update you
they played two songs this entire trip
we've realized Plain Jane and God's plan
hello Motorsports our three motors are
first but like pretty much just God plan
like that is actually been played like a
bajillion times I'm not mad about it
so I got more food and I'm never gonna
be over these like homemade chips I know
they make them homemade because they're
at war and so ya ma'am you're walking so
good
yeah did you just go to that stand that
we saw like yesterday oh yeah I feel you
guys walk forever that was so good
oh we don't have to pay for bath morning
we freed me and I are gonna go
paddleboarding right now I'm really
excited because we've been wanting to go
like this whole time and I just realized
I got legit so burned today like what
like I thought I was crispy before but I
guess not
so yeah lol um that's okay you like for
you to say I don't think I'm gonna peel
or anything it doesn't feel like that
type of burn but my hair's been getting
so crazy and the ocean it literally just
like this big fluffy Balmain it's like
weighing me down
so guys the last time I talked to you
you're gonna go paddle boarding and then
try to go paddle boarding and it didn't
work because they only have paddle
boarding until 2 and it was like 6 or
whatever
so we tried in May when it was good it
was really sad that's ok and I think
we're gonna go in 9 a.m. tomorrow
because I should leave by like 10 to go
to the airport and yeah I just showered
I'm like a crisp little bean if you can
tell so I just like covered my body
lotion but yeah
I want to show them meeting the first
floor by now should be surprised William
we found this place Magdalena literally
everyone calm it's really good I when
I'm blogging on Tasha's phone or now I
don't have my phone or my blog camera
but I just have any like real food going
out it was so good that was like one of
my favorite dinners ever it was really
yummy went to LA whatever I said in the
videos that I just owned it was so yummy
and we had the best dessert ever made
Rose ever so and what was that sparkler
think it was like such a loud bang did
he crack such a loud thing but yeah it
was like really cute and we love it and
the service was like so great like the
people are so nice it's like way way way
way way better than America and so
American servers need to take us nothing
fun weirdo beardo servers um yeah now we
have to go out I'm like feeling my burn
today like I just feel like I'm
radiating heat I feel like very hot but
yeah we have to go because it's our last
day it's like I've been so hot I
blogging this trip I'm sorry everybody
it's been fun I promise good morning
guys it's my last day here I guess the
last morning cuz I will legit after
leaving like less than an hour but we
need to go paddleboarding together first
on the priority and this is so nice
right now having no one out here this is
weird seeing this pool empty we're
running to go paddleboard I'm really
and one wearing Tasha's bathing suit I
think this is Tasha or is it Anna's
Emmet's Frank he's again I'm so obsessed
like I wouldn't go in him I'm buying all
their baby food I don't know how I
didn't know about them like literally
beautiful but anyway this is so pretty
annoying I was earlier like every
morning I'm sad the update words that
yesterday proposed was 9 because we
tried to go out like five or six and
they were like not close that like two
or three or whatever where's the
lighting even good around here I don't
even know but um so yeah we tried to go
and now they're just like yelling at
people on walkie-talkie
it's like 9:40 my name is queen for my
11 like no yeah then the guy was just
like you know what opens at 11:00
tomorrow you'll do it was that Tyler a
liar I'm like no you're a liar where's
that okay cross your fingers he's coming
back it's going fine I'm pretty sure if
we brought it underwater all they would
see is brown like the water is brown
guys I don't know if you can tell the
dark it is like why is it so dark I
think it's just like dirt mud or
something
it's our last morning and we had to beg
them to let us out on these paddle
boards because it apparently opens at
11:00 but it's like 9:00 yeah yesterday
they told us 9:00 and I need to get on
my plate and we just illegally took off
our life jackets and we're back fam my
figure is just over the ledge
and meanly I've been taking a photo
shoot and really I need to go get on my
flight but what is more important here
yes you did it it was really funny
followed I'm so impressed he just like
fell straight on the board we took
pictures there yesterday and it was so
cute it was like cool shadows there's a
little bow over there
what else can I describe to you if we
crash
I leave my ballads that I follow each
other oh my god this is so hard to
balance I think my knees are like
shaking the entire time okay guys if you
go get on my plate out
he's been fun okay it's 10:59 I have to
go board my flight right now so I'm just
gonna rinse my nose off in the pool and
leave my cookie you get chicken nugget
when I'm sweating
who wouldn't have to leave all right
okay I'm just gonna call my friends you
gotta send it
it is 1:45 fun tax I broke my camera on
vacation it went under the ocean water
so it stops filming every couple seconds
but that's okay um but yeah what I was
saying is like real print like
thoughtful presents are better than the
dollar bill I don't know that's why I
should say I'm being really weird and
rambling because it's like Who I am so I
gotta go to bed but I love you guys so
much thanks very following up along on
my journey through life so deep and
through these vlogs traveling and such
it's really fun oh wait I didn't mean
okay I'll just say this like like I
didn't say this earlier because I did it
at the airport once we're out there and
I didn't vlog at the airport anything
but before I left Mexico when I was in
PD at the airport I was texting Maggie
and I'm out and we were like Frick yeah
let's go to Miami next week because
we're doing swimsuit videos what's awful
you guys know is awful is like my
favorite swimsuit ever I'm so excited we
get to do video with them again and so
we're like wait let's go to Miami where
we can actually try them on the beach
and like run around and show people that
and stuff because that's even way more
helpful than me just like showing them
in my dorm room you know so if we just
did like a really impromptu like trip
for that we're just gonna be so fun and
kind of gave us like a reason to go and
don't worry I'm not missing any class
because I only have class Monday
Wednesday now because I dropped my
finance class and so we're going like
Wednesday night Saturday morning so I'm
going to be missing nothing so no one
