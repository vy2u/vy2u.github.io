it is 9:00 a.m. on our way to our baby
right now I just left at Lucy's
apartment we made it our Airbnb is so
cute I need to give them like a tour
right now this window is all I've been
looking for in my life it's gonna be the
coolest pictures like look at this this
is what I picture I picture Paris like
how beautiful oh we have to chat below
get questions on this anyway because I
feel like people always notice like
things that you're wearing like jewelry
clothes and stuff but I got this new
watch how cute is it oh wait there we go
it was like upside down it's just from
JC they like the cutest watches but got
like the tan one it's like tan leather I
know it has 76 diamonds like all around
the side and then the dial is like
genuine mother-of-pearl so this watch is
like so nice guys I know it's also water
resistant which is really cool because I
hate having to worry about that and yeah
I know this is just like Italian leather
like I was talking about it's like
really nice leather and I really like
that they have the different straps that
you can attach so you can like change
the band's color without changing like
the watch face itself watches like this
that are like so nice typically caused
more than like $2,000 so even though
they are pricey because they're like
really nice quality and then I know this
straps are just like switch up the look
and make basically make it look like a
whole different watch oh and like $65
each so yeah I'll have it linked down
below in case you guys are interested do
you like it isn't it cute shiny so Lucy
is going to go it to her internship now
and the guys are Airbnb is so cute I
have to show you around
it's literally adorable and me and Tasha
are gonna get ready a bit more and then
we will try to have their on the train
hopefully we make it because we really
don't speak any French and it's really
funny us getting around just the two of
us because we don't have Lucy to help us
and then we're gonna meet me at her
internship it just explore it'll be a
really fun day this is exactly where we
came after I are at the airport
yeah tell me how you feel about potatoes
I remember there so that's like at last
time enjoy I got this million and it was
like whatever but I think the waiter is
here I think we're funny because we
clearly don't speak like a like a French
so they like make kind of us but it's
guys ha she's so tired she's going on
like probably 80 hours not sleeping and
she just goes she goes where's your car
dude oh look at DIY okay oh you take
your card I think so we just end up in
McDonald's and I have these really cool
futuristic order things that I've never
seen in my life you don't want some and
I go look at ah damn mommy tell them
what you said about our hot waiter went
oh my gosh Tasha Oreo and I got like a
cookie butter flavor and it's so good so
this is the window I just closed it cuz
it's getting a little chilly it's chilly
in Paris this time of year and this is
like a little hearts a family room
living room area guys it's seriously so
cute like look at it this rug is like
adorable it's so cozy and they said the
couch is like brand-new so they put a
little cute blankie on it there's a
picture
the ceilings I just think are awesome I
remember seeing the ceilings and the
Airbnb listing and I'm like this place
is cool there's some books over there
there's like a little kitchen over here
like we'll eat out most of the time
anyway but in case my mom wants like it
anything's for like breakfast or
groceries or whatever there's like a
bedroom over here it's just like two
little bedrooms cuz there's just gonna
be three of us today and then four of us
for a couple more nights with Tasha me
my mom and Lu
the closet and then of course really
cute window again and then going back
out this way past the kitchen
Tosh's in the bathroom getting ready and
I was alone and they're like quite
little but like we said every place in
Paris is little in this place like it's
not like horribly little you know it's
like New York like every place it's
gonna be little and then it's funny
because like the sink a mirror and a
shower over there and then they're just
like a toilet in this little room over
here so I think it's funny there's a
good washer and dryer but I don't think
will really do laundry there's a front
door and I think this is a room at Tasha
and I will stay in just like a cute the
children there's me there's a big closet
over here and yeah what's out here oh
just like more pretty views Paris is so
pretty guys I think everything is so
like beautiful in Paris and like
photogenic so okay I'm just talking we
gotta get ready for the day better go
get food so Tasha doesn't starve I had a
bunch of frosted flakes this morning out
of the box oh I'm not that hungry but
I'll still eat always eat
guys it's seriously like so good is this
this is the best waffle ever in America
so it definitely is here too and my
avocado toast looks so yummy oh yeah
cute it's the latest benek please hang
in here
it smells so good that smells so good
they're like not that many nail places
and stuff here so we just stopped by
where Lucy works or she has our
internships it was really cute and like
soothing and then like pretty and I felt
like spring spring every day we're down
you said mom look at this wait Lucy what
is it called what is it called love all
my Shay hey so you look at how pretty
and yeah this is explaining to us like
all the different brands here there
instead of like different stores are all
just like different little boots it's
really cool there's like a lute meet on
one arm as wine like Tory Burch so many
friends there's like Chanel
wait I want to look in keels because I
want their self tanner Maggie and me or
at souls like a little girl
we're talking about self tanner and a
girl butted in she's like I'm really
sort of like button your conversation
right now but you guys need to try the
key of self tanner it's my favorite dude
right now just like Tasha's favorite
store
I need to cue to stuff from try in a bit
you're vlogging versus me vlogging
Tosh is talking I'm just dancing um
picked up some clothes we're in Brandi
what's new and I feel dumb buying in
Paris because we're literally like
things I can get in Boston but this
shirt says Paris so and I just bought a
bunch of stuff that subdued it's gonna
be so cute maybe I should do like a
little Paris haul while I'm here I for
sure well it'll be fun but oh yeah you
need those Vuitton shoes not enough to
buy them yeah I just got this during
blogs miss oh wait I don't know if I
showed it yet she don't tell anyone I
told you I think that comes later on I'm
ready messing up putting my presence in
each day I keep forgetting so uh when is
even the last time I blogged I don't
remember I think it was three days ago
basically me and Tasha came back after
shopping and such I put on my new a
parachute that I got from brandy it's
really cute and me like naps not on
purpose but we're both just like so
tired and jet-lagged and then now it's
like 9:00 is it 9:00 already like 9:00
and so we're gonna go eat dinner with
Lucy I just put my jeans again in my
leather jacket so I'm gonna put on my
little slides we're gonna party my feet
cuz they're like new not really broken
in yet but yeah that is the plan
and then tomorrow we are gonna meet up
with the dope peeps and take pics with
that man sup homie just figured out how
to make the heat work and our Airbnb and
Tosh and I are like so excited because
we were literally for eating our butts
off earlier like this is not gonna work
but we figured it out so yeah we're
going to this place now I figure what
it's called baltoy when we get there to
be really good Italian just what we need
where we'll be oh we were supposed to go
to Cafe Charlotte which I ended up being
really dramatic because long story short
I was like crying because Lucy is
stranded we're pretty sure because
she does on the phone or anything and
like probably know why I signed her
computer might be dead
it she doesn't have any key to her
apartment sometime like it so she's not
here with us even though she was
supposed to be because we told her that
we like we're going to a different
restaurant it's literally two minutes
down the street but she wouldn't know
they went to the old ones try to get her
but I couldn't find her anyway
business has married everything and
happy always its crops whether it's from
forever I think yep and it's just like
peach peach 1313 sighs jingle all the
way I actually love these I love these
little sponges look how cute they are
I have like little baby Beautyblender
ones and you like blend out your like
eye concealer under eye concealer then
love these are really cute oh here's 14
