different video and it's just a little
bit of fun so recently I was just
thinking of all the reasons I love
having a twin sister if you guys don't
know I have a twin sister named Lucy we
actually put vlog Channel together it's
called Gretchen Lucy so definitely go
subscribe and if you're not subscribed
to this channel definitely subscribe if
you want to see my videos I was just
thinking of all the reasons I love
having a twin sister and why I feel so
grateful so I started to make a list and
I actually have a list of 20 perks of
being a twin and I just thought it would
be fun to share with you guys you might
think it's interesting so yeah let's
just get on into it I love you Lucy when
you see this perk number one they help
you stir cookie dough perk number two
they actually double the size of your
closet so helpful well I mean I guess if
you're like the same gender twins but
not if you're like a boy girl tonight
perk number three they are always there
to straighten the back of your head I
don't know how I would do it honestly
without a twin sister like I just don't
know freak number four is they can
easily cook double the food to give you
half this saves my life Lucy cooks for
me all the time it is a life saver
number five they can drive you places
because you are usually going to the
same place literally a story of our
lives like we spend every minute of
every day together we share a car but it
doesn't even matter because we're always
going places together anyway number six
they can read your mind number seven
they always know what you need and the
right thing to say since you were born
a perfect match my Lou number eight they
don't judge you because you're pretty
much the same number nine they are
always there to zipper your dress
sometimes those zippers can be so hard
thank God for twins number ten they are
always there for a shoulder to cry on
number eleven but they are also a source
of endless laughter seriously until
you're like peeing your pants on the
ground curled up in a ball crying of
laughter we can make each other laugh
like no other number twelve they know
you better than you know yourself
seriously they do like she can tell me
how I'm feeling better than I know how
I'm feeling or if I tell her how I'm
feeling she knows why like she's like
cuz this is what you really want or this
is how you know she just knows they know
number thirteen they surprise you at
exactly the right moment and when you
need to be cheered up the most literally
I'm not even kidding like yay I remember
Lucy got me a bathing suit and it just
seems so small but I think I was in like
a bad mood that day or whatever and it
was like literally the perfect moment
and she just surprised me and it just
made my day
like they just know you so well she can
tell and I'm down I can tell when she's
down you know number fourteen they hold
you to a high standard and keep you
focused and on task I would not get half
of things done that I do it without Lou
fifteen you never run out of things to
talk about with them you can literally
just talk forever about anything to like
the weirdest things sixteen they have
your best interest in mind and won't
allow you to take crap from anyone in
this I'm so thankful for because
sometimes you are blinded by feelings
and emotions and relationships with
people but your twins can really see
what's going on and they're like you
know what don't talk to that person
anymore break up with it you know what I
mean they don't let you take crap from
anyone it's great like you're a little
guardian angel looking out for you at
all times seventeen they can laugh with
you at family inside jokes and crazy
relatives this could not be more true
this video if you have crazy families
and relatives do 18 they hold your hand
at concerts seriously Lucy is like my
life like she is just I don't know I
would not have any friends if it wasn't
for Lucy because she's my best friend 19
they tie back your hair when you're sick
she takes care of me when I'm sick and I
take care of her when she's sick you
know and last but not least 20 if they
will make forts for the two of you this
is so fun the other day I got home and
Lucy had a little port for us and we
just hung out and watch movies and it
was great so if you have a twin you
pretty much know all of this I mean if
you're like a boy boy twin maybe someone
them like don't apply like straightening
the back of your head if you're a girl
girl twin you probably know if you're a
boy-girl twin I don't really know I just
wanted to make this video because I was
just thinking of all the perks of having
a twin that like other people just don't
get to experience I feel like maybe if
you have a best friend or another
sibling but I don't know I just feel
like twins have something special going
on I just feel really lucky that I get
to be a twin you know so let's see when
you're watching this I love you very
much and I don't know where I would be
without you I was just thinking of like
fun reasons I'm happy to be alive and
share my life with my twin sister you
know so yeah thank you so much for
watching this video and I'll see you in
my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
