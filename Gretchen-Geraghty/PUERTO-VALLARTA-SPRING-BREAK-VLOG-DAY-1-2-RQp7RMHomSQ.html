being outside of where we met
at 3:15 my alarm went off my phone and I
was like wait a minute I think for the
airport right now
so remick's my room about my vacation my
friends and roommates were like getting
me in my little car and sending in my
life stuff
the airport and I honestly guys I don't
know how I got here but like I'm in one
piece oh my god I slept my make fun last
night that I didn't wear any of my
jewelry or anything all my rings all my
braces my necklace my earrings because I
was like I'm just gonna like lose em oh
yeah I left on a flasher like already
I found them there right no not these
ones then oh now I've learned my lesson
I'm gonna wear my $10 yes
I'm gonna I need to show them what it
looks like outside
this isn't eggs I don't like in handle
swiss guys wait oh my god
this is so we just ate dinner and it's
so pretty
it's like golden hour right now
like I want to be like standing there
for a picture I love like golden mark
pictures the best
there's so many people what I'm really
here because it's always so loud down
there
I got this what do you think this is a
cupcake cupcake hey let's see how it is
boys
would not recommend this rock
antosha can't eat her pie because it
smells wrong really this is an informal
introduction hello I said this is your
formal introduction so Anna tell us
about yourself oh my god I always forget
that like she's your big you know I
think I know you
when I think of you I think of you in
that yellow dress yeah I think the
people I think of people in an outfit
that weird when I think of you Tasha I
think of you and your gut ball out
because it was like so cool and I felt
safe it was a Munich like everything in
the Hat I know so guys we are going now
it's gonna be fine I mean a birthday
dress honey but I've been so bad I
belong okay I'm gonna belong
everything's wrong I'm going to get a
show every single thing we're doing so
that people think it's interesting okay
bye so guys I like I didn't really nap
because I don't know if you can hear
like how loud the music is out there I
was just trying
like literally the walls shake like the
bed I'm not getting the bed shake
because I fell out the music is like
we're like right on the ground level so
it's just really freaking loud during
the day and and I and all the time but
whatever so I just played here with my
head once in for a bit and I knew I just
needed to take away and I'm feeling
better but then and I was gonna go out
and join him I hear just laying in the
Sun but then I realized I haven't
assigned and I have to do and I want to
have a chat about school but I want to
figure out what I have to say first
because I think people have been asking
me so much about what everyone's like do
you even go to school oh my god how do
you like Travis lunch with school
some people think I don't like
prioritize my education much I don't
like when people say that because if I
didn't want to be in college I wouldn't
be do you know what I mean like look if
I'm there and paying to be there I want
to be there and I thought my education I
want my degree
he already mean like so many people that
do YouTube don't do college which is
fine and that's what they wanted to like
that's what they're doing for themselves
but the fact that I'm McAfee you means
that I want to be there you know I'm
saying anyway that's all and I'm still
full time student fully enrolled taking
all the class that you take so I guess I
just did the school talk kind of but
yeah that's it
you know what yeah I'll just tell you
right now so pretty much and people were
confused because I was talking about
this in like a college day in my life
and a lot of people were like oh my gosh
you can't just like give up when things
get harder stuff like that but I I don't
know there was a lot of backlash when I
wasn't expecting it cuz I was just
trying to like promote like you have to
do what makes you happy whatever so
basically i what i mean the question
school of business you guys know that
and I'm I had two concentrations before
I was concentrating and finance and
marketing and that's ready like pretty
ambitious like to do two instead of one
because you have time for like one and a
half so then if you do too
you have to like overload or take a
class over at summer or whatever so I
was doomed to and then it was the last
day I talked about this in the college
day my life play it was the last day to
drop
I was out of W and I was sitting in my
finance class and I was like I didn't
enjoy learning about it anymore and I
used to you but I mean as you feel like
into deeper levels of it like obviously
it's like different like hard stuff
I don't know all I'm trying to say is I
realized I didn't like it so I dropped
my finance class and I dropped my
finance concentration which is totally
fine I'm still concentrating in
marketing so many people are like so are
you just like doing nothing now no
concentration in marketing and I really
love marketing and I know it's right for
me because all my marketing costs I'm
taking right now I love I'm taking
luxury marketing and that's what I have
to actually do an assignment for it
right now
that's Tuesday and then I'm taking
consumer behavior marketing and I'm
taking psych 101 would usually like a
freshman class so it's like pretty easy
so my course love definitely is not as
hard as it was like last semester with
core like I really only have class
Monday Wednesday yeah whatever it's
confusing
I don't know I'm being so confusing
right now oh oh y'all go I have to do my
assignment
I think I'm just being really frazzled
because it's so loud but I'm gonna bring
you guys along and show you more subside
guys look at how pretty it is I need to
show you more of everything look at how
cute right here it's like people get
massages right there and I took you I
think it'll be really relaxing if you
couldn't hear like blasting music the
whole time hi friends they're all like
napping in the shade because hey I don't
have Sun before the Sun is so hot today
like yesterday it was
like okay wait that doesn't make sense
suddenly said walk today talk but I mean
like yesterday when I was out in the Sun
like I wasn't hot but I felt like
there's something strong but today I
think it's strong and it's hot whatever
I'm gonna shut up now oh yeah so I used
to my homework assignment inside a bit
edited something youtube vids I'm like
behind so much of my Florida vlog we
kind of catch up though I don't know if
I can really handle going out tonight so
maybe I'll stay in and catch up on
videos but oh my god this sand is so hot
guys it's burning my feet someone's
parasailing I want to do that looks fun
I love that
I literally came running to the water it
disposed Mikey were burning
the ocean I notice is like wait but I
don't even know we're pretty later it is
no I do okay I don't mean to sound up in
Mexico so I'm like 99 when I'm sure this
Pacific Ocean which I've only been in
like once before in Costa Rica actually
be around with the Pacific coast and I
remember the water being like darker and
like the ocean was really like rough and
I feel like is a house Pacific Ocean
Oasis yeah I feel like it's more like
rough I don't know anyway I'm probably
gonna get any sense but it feels really
good and my hot feet I really wanted
parents downtown I'm telling you so fun
you just feel like you're like above
everything
I want to show the vlog the rock look at
the rock oh my god like these waves are
so strong I'm about to get like knocked
over but this place is so cool I really
like it being quiet and serene over here
I'm over hit the music
hi blog I like don't know what I'll to
show them I'm like we're just chillin
it is crunchy click here you hear that
something is wrong oh my god okay
there's like water all over the lens
this is just a new baby oh good news is
it's still filming today for like an
hour I didn't even like play really I
just kind of walked around but that's
good too much Sun is okay we're gonna go
now we're gonna go get sushi I think
let's see how this sushi is indeed part
of priority' I feel like it might not be
good but we will see I thought this will
be cool and it literally looks just
weird cuz I hate it already okay you got
me so queasy miso soup yeah okay we got
miso soup and there's some weird
substances that we don't know I think
this is big crab and that's like squishy
tofu and I think are these like rice
noodles I know I use my fork we think
this is cheese maybe it's like
mozzarella sticks kind of
you don't think I thought that was the
chicken it's cheap um I gotta to
literally come on surrealistic this is
so fun good
is it go
this one's good yes I did
this is so pretty I put on the camera
you don't I mean like
you guys don't even know how pretty it
is right now but it's really pretty
the lighting is a one touch to later
yeah it's bad
I have wet hair and go makeup in your
t-shirt this would be really good
lighting to film a video I'm gonna come
to live in it I know perfecto
we had the Sun just went down really
quick
like that it's like quiet and chill out
here I know I wait I have all the lights
behind us like those our wedding is
still noon
you know how
get on the boat
I don't know if the camera can see them
but I can see em they're right there and
me so now we are back from sunset and
dinner and I'm talking about accent and
now me and Tasha are going to the hot
tub and I think I've convinced everyone
to not go out I'm just like you know
sometimes have to be responsible 21 is
the year of me being responsible oh wait
someone said something the other day and
I was like that's gonna be my motto for
this year I like being accountable for
your actions and I'm like that's
something I should work on oh it wasn't
it SoulCycle she said something about
like accountability and I was like yes
girl yes anyway we're gonna go to the
hot tub oh and we're actually gonna go
to the beach too because oddly enough
the Wi-Fi on the beach is way better
than in our room that's like it was so
weird to me like there's two different
Wi-Fi xor's like friendly Vienna and
friendly Beach or Beata beach or
whatever and the beach one guys is so
much better like how does that make any
sense maybe there's a router out by the
beach that's stronger like I don't know
yeah we must have Wi-Fi so I didn't fill
in the hot tub and we were just coming
back but then I realized I need to film
for you guys but in the hot tub it was
really fun there's some obnoxious people
staying here but it's okay we're not
letting the murder of occasion we were
like bye oh my god this is good light
hello
and I'm so impressed I put my hair up of
no ponytail that's like the best movie
to bet you just like twist it all up and
it's the scale
the male species crazy baby what did you
say
oh we like met men and women are like
two differences it's so fun observing
them and we have look at that one look
at him go I'm gonna make a video
observing the male species that would be
so interesting the flags of the frat
stars oh my god yeah the kings
everywhere Mexico to show everyone this
place is something else we're at our
second dinner and it's really good I got
two kinds of salsa and really thin walk
