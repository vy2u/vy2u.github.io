bug mistake 14 and it's not even really
morning because it is 1:45 p.m. because
I'm so my stuff because of the times
like it's also really weird that it's
Thursday because I slept all of
Wednesday missing me both woke up at
11:30 which was really bad because it
was these internships at 11:00 so she
like scooted on over to her internship I
just showered got ready and I packed my
stuff tried like consolidate Lucy's room
a bit cuz her room is really little and
Todd was actually landing in like 15-20
minutes I'm just waiting for her I'm so
excited but this is gonna be really
tricky sharing this room we're just
sharing like one night and Lucy's room
and then tomorrow morning go to our
Airbnb
I know I was just saying how it's gonna
be a little tricky squishing at Tasha
Lucy and I all in here for tonight
because Lucy's I guess like don't wanna
you could call a dorm room it's quite
little you guys want to see it before it
gets too dark because it's only like
4:15 4:30 right now but it's already
getting like so dark yeah I don't know
we're leaving tomorrow morning so I
should give you it well two are really
quick so this is when you walk in on
something that I think is kind of funny
it's like this is her key this is how
you like get into the room I don't know
what get America you know we don't
really have keys like this so it just
looks cool let me turn on it's getting
so dark okay so this is like a quick
overview of Lucy's room it's actually
quite big I would say probably bigger
than a lot of dorms in America or at
least I'd be you so it just looks like
this and she just has this little twin
bed over here which she really nicely
let me sleep in last night and probably
Tasha and I will share her bed tonight
and she got a mattress topper so she
just put that on the ground so that's
right Lucy slept when also I didn't even
say this she is at the City University
of France it's like hey I don't really
know I don't know it speak French so
what I'm gonna try to say it how they
say it in French and she brought this
little poster with her and she brought
that one as well also with her dorm room
just came at this little desk
she's like a cute little wooden desk I
would say also pretty typical with like
American dorms you get mini fridge so
she just has a little mini fridge just
Nana's oh and in France you guys know
the drinking age is
18 in Europe I think everywhere in
Europe I think it's 18 don't quote me on
that but I think that so she's been able
to you know Lucy just really doesn't
like alcohol it's one because she's not
even hearing down I'm telling you all
this
she really still doesn't even like wine
which is like I sit in Europe like they
drink wine with everything so off her
fridge her boyfriend is from Ireland but
he actually studies in Amsterdam and he
was just here and she said that he likes
Birla so they drink lunch beer that
feels so weird to say I could look at
America were not even allowed to but
anyway there's some oatmeal this I think
is the funniest thing ever also has
nothing to do with like door mugging
here but the oats here come in a box
like what up here it came with like this
shelf little thing that goes around the
room she has some shoes up there her
also came with this little nice Dan
little thing man her closet is also
quite big I would say the strip seems
bigger to me than dorms in America and
also what I think is really cool is her
room has a sink I know some dorms at
colleges in the US had that but at BU we
don't so I just think that's kind of
cool cuz you don't even need to go out
to wash your hands or like brush your
teeth at night and then her view is so
cute oh cool so yeah that is it pretty
much Lucy's dorm tour and I found this
little whoa stand to put my camera on
perfect so voila just put on my outfit
it's really cute I'll show you at the
end but I just have to touch up my
makeup and such
you guys already know I use if he is
makeup brushes that come on I joined one
of them a bunch of times before and
everyone always like I said tweets me
I'm like are they commenting on that
video member I just like a morning
routine showing these real fans you'll
remember kidding but a beer would be for
my day what do you remember I think it
was last year the year before I showed
that I was using these and I've like
turned all my friends onto these like
Taylor uses them loose use them and
they're just this brush set from vanity
planet and it's called like the makeup
palettes brushed it I think and I'll
have it linked down below use my clipper
70% off because seriously then they're
so cheap and like obviously they're so
worth it everyone I show them to we Tosh
you actually have to feel these they're
the softest brushes you'll ever feel
gosh these look actually so soft so
anyway they're really great I'm just
gonna touch up my makeup with them we're
just gonna get ready I play you guys
some music like normal except you know
copyright on you too
these days alright so I'm just gonna
they're falling out I'm just gonna use
this little Belen z1 I was caught about
to call it a buffer brush literally I'm
such a good makeup artists here I
actually rediscovered this Too Faced
natural and eye palette I still make up
all over when I was like not makeup
ladies that nail polish when I was like
seventh grade and this is like really
old this is like literally from seventh
grade but like I said okay it's very
it's fine why is my eyeshadow creasing a
primer well anyway I'm just gonna put
some more and you know for nighttime
when we go out we like to look dark we
like to have a dark look because I even
know what maybe it's because when you go
out it's like really dark outside and
dark inside of where you're going so you
need to wear extra makeup so that people
can see it you know why do people wear
dark except maybe to like emulate
nighttime since it is nighttime let me
know um well this one looks pretty it's
like sparkly and black I'm just gonna
use the same brush because why not oh
wait this is really pretty I think I
always just go for the blending ones
because then you can't my separately
because it just like blends out all of
your mistakes you know what I mean that
is my tip like flat shakers really scare
me
umm because then you don't blend it out
or then it's a car to let it out when
you screw up you know looking mess in
night tiny but actually I just lied
because I'm about to use this flat
shader one for this which one did I use
earlier ooh this sparkly one right here
and then I just put it
is it in here oh no my strap I wish this
was a more leg get ready with night time
with us but um yeah
normally there's music just things like
rap music right now okay my face
sometimes I literally go crazy like put
a liquid over all of the stuff I already
have one and which probably like isn't
the right way to do it I mean definitely
look he's never clean liquid over a
powder that you put on it up whatever
like it's really not that but it's still
kind of there so then I just like touch
up this is like a really this is like
the really soft I'm talking about like
Taylor uses it every day and she
obviously should probably wash it
because use it so much and she does
about you but I wash mine so much like
these feet I actually just got anyone
see these ones are newer because um the
other ones are so long I got new ones
and so I'm just touching up where I get
really oily I should've put more
under-eye concealer oh well I guess I
never went for the dark and scary look
oh okay
and then oh this guy also used some
seventh grade this is the exact one I
really am not running out until now I
think miss muses big fluffy one again um
oh yeah I just got any one of these from
when this runs out because it's
literally the best ones ever like look
at this mm-hmm
nice and dark you wanna look like you
were just in Turks and Caicos even
though you weren't you were in Boston
rock star is succulent right now you're
listening to in the car today but lemon
laughs Wow this is what I use for bless
you blush oh yeah my blushes like really
screw up I always use orgasm it's just
like this really pretty pink shiny color
get your head under the cutter guys hmm
we're just talking about blush here I
just love how soft these brushes are I
think they apply your makeup really
evenly and just like blend it all out
don't forget to check out my link in the
description box so we can be twins need
the same stuff little brushes Oh freak
my lips through like look look at this
cuz it's been on there since like eight
I am sad I am brothers I'm gonna wipe it
off a little bit def a XS alright maybe
oh oh it's coming off quite easily wow
I'm impressed the Kylie ones I've
noticed like you need like a weapon to
get that off of your lipstick they
literally don't come off at all with
like soap water force nothing
makeup remover but this is the Smashbox
one and I'm just like rubbing it on is
coming off that's nice okay so it's like
pretty much off now you know I might
switch up the color actually I might go
you switch my mind just there this is
the dark sparkly red one then I guess
you today just like nighttime fun when
I'm gonna put on like maroon dangly
earrings so this will go with this like
a Smashbox shiny one it's a really dark
and pretty over for Ireland's 21st
birthday it's really hard to put on
without lip liner but we will figure
mmm clearly so good at me over here have
Miranda sings okay okay what that smells
good low red lip oh and I wanted to show
