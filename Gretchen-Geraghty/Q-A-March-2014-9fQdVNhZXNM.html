how did I get such tan skin well I just
got back from Costa Rica so right now if
you can notice it's actually already
faded because I got back like almost a
week ago but um I'm tanner
I like normally and I believe I don't
know if you can tell I don't fake tan at
all like I've never used fake Tanner I'm
like scared of it over the summer I'm
like black because our lifeguard and I
like guard outside like eight hours a
day so I get really really tan but now
I'm just hand because I just got back
from vacation but other than that I'm
really not that tan like in the dead of
winter I'm like pale um but yeah if you
see pictures of me tan it's either
because I'm wearing a crap ton of
bronzer or because I just like got back
from vacation and did I even mention
this guy's i got like braids like
cornrows kind of corn rows is that what
they're called they're like the braids
are just like braided along your head
and I got them like a few days ago
started turning like ratty but I love
him it keeps my hair look out of my face
like I would like do it again like if I
could get it done here it's a pretty
cool but yeah those are my braids side
note do you have a car and if so which
one I do not have a car I actually don't
have my license and an almost 17 we're
not going to talk about it do you have a
religion yes i do i'm christian i'm
catholic but I'm not like I don't want
like offend anyone but I'm not like
really really religious but are young
Catholic what is one goal that you have
for the future well one goal that I have
that I don't even know if it's a
possibility but me and my twin sister
like obsessed with crew like rowing and
our goal is to win Stotesbury in a
double but yeah I don't really know if
that's gonna happen but if you guys like
no crew you know stotesbury and our
dream is to like when stotesbury in a
double what was your first job I'm a
lifeguard right now look at the YMCA my
first job look real job was lifeguarding
what I did over the summer and it's like
literally it was like the best job ever
and I'm gonna do it like every summer
it's like right down the road for me to
the like these like apartment pools and
yeah that was like my first job was
lifeguarding i started youtube obviously
before i started working there and like
I get paid from youtube so maybe that
could even be considered my first job
have you ever been fired no I've never
been fired where do you want to travel
to i would love to travel to australia
because that would just be really cool
what is one thing you want to accomplish
this year this year I'd like to figure
out where I want to go to college I
don't know if that's like realistic but
I at least need like a better idea
because right now it's totally up in the
air
no idea and um look maybe another
accomplishment would just be like have a
good GPA and like keep my grades up
because like school and like grades is
really important to me what's my least
favorite food uh I really do not like
sour cream and onion chips and I do not
like lots of kinds of cheeses I know
pretty random this one says I love you
and what's the best advice you can give
to have a successful life that's kind of
like an open-ended question like I I
don't really know why you're asking me
how to have a successful life but um I
love you too and I would just say like
do what makes you happy because in the
end that's all that really matters is
that you're happy so don't do other
stuff because for other reasons like
people are pressuring you or like you
think you should just do what makes you
happy and that's really all that matters
I guess will you be were doing a room
tour I don't know I haven't really
thought about it that much and my room
isn't like exactly how I wanted so maybe
someday right now in my sisters room and
I always film in here because there's a
big window right there and I always have
good lighting but maybe someday I'll do
over into her I don't know off to think
about it tips for hair growing for those
of you that don't know my hair is pretty
long it goes like past my belly button I
believe um but it's kind of like dead
too and I've been thinking about getting
it cut I'm not really sure but i might
be getting it cut soon but um tips would
be don't cut it like i know people are
like get it trimmed like every month
like whatever but honestly i haven't cut
my hair in over a year Shh i know it's
so bad and all of you can bet creditors
all about it so dead let get it cut off
and i probably will because i realized
that i know it's a little disgusting um
but honestly if you want your be long
don't cut it cuz that's what i did and
you don't cut your hair it's really long
do you want to get any tattoos oh no i
don't really want tattoos because I feel
like I might regret it I don't really
that's not my thing oh my gosh my
stomach is so itchy guys I got so
sunburned and Costa Rica like I'm so
itchy all the time like I literally want
to like show you my stomach like wait
can you see that oh my god I'm sober
okay that's probably really
inappropriate but like my whole back is
number two and it's peeling
itching my back I'm like chunks of skin
really coming off I'm so itchy and so
sunburned and I can't even take it but
anyways and what's the worst when you
burn your butt because then your butt
just all the time but you can't really
eat your butt because that's embarrassed
when's the first time you had starbucks
i don't know maybe like middle school
what drink to you order at starbucks uh
I kind of don't like coffee that much so
I usually get like strawberries and
cream something is just like a
Frappuccino kind of like flavor II drink
it's yummy are you ever going back to
normal hair color probably not because I
realized that I like very blonde hair
looks on me better I don't know I feel
like it looks better on me brownie looks
like okay to like I don't know but I
think I like blonde better on me so
probably not anytime soon but yeah if
you don't know look that is my normal
hair color it's like kind of medium dark
brown it looks really really dark next
to my blonde hair but it's kind of like
medium brown favorite makeup brand would
probably be either Mac or benefit I
realized like all my makeup is benefit
so I must like it I wear a lot of
benefit do you watch gossip girl if you
do who's your favorite person from
Gossip Girl um I did watch cross
squirrel I watched like all of the
seasons and I loved it and my favorite
person would probably be either Serena
or chalk and I love Chuck and Blair
they're just so cute but yeah I love
certainty like blake lively's like I
love her are you a morning person or a
nighttime person definitely a nighttime
person like I can't even wake up in the
morning and I can sleep too like 2pm and
I can stay up to like five I am like I'm
definitely a night person how long did
it take you to grow your hair uh I don't
really know maybe like over a year but
like I don't really know where I was
starting probably up here or something
but I just like really don't get it cut
that much um but yeah maybe overlook a
year what is your current phone case
okay this like hideous thing but usually
until like a few days ago I just had it
normal like this um because I oh my god
so bad i would i have like several phone
cases too but on I like get phone cases
and I don't wear them because I like the
way my phone feels better without one
like is anyone like me like I just don't
like the way cases be on my phone but
you know I just gotta deal with it in my
case is because this is the fourth
iphone I've cracked from not wearing a
case um but yeah I have this one on now
but you know just because you reminded
me I'm taking it off I hate it can you
do a morning routine oh I actually
already did a morning routine you can
see on my channel but yeah i'll probably
do nuin soon because i know you guys
like that a lot do you prefer to film in
the day or at night do you have studio
lighting i performed well during the day
definitely um because then i have
natural lighting like in front of this
window like right now it's 541 and it's
getting dark so the wedding's probably
change like it probably got darker too
um but yeah I definitely prefer feeling
during the day um so that there's
natural lighting and i do not have
studio lighting so I really can't let me
film during the day are you ever gonna
do a meetup PS i love you oh my gosh i
love you too and um I don't know if I'm
gonna do meet up I haven't really
thought about it like I don't know if
there's enough people in the area that
will let come meet me but then again
there is like 40-something thousand of
you that watch me so maybe someday I
will Juliana says can Jacqueline sarah
and i please be your bridesmaids yes
Juliana you and Jacqueline and Sarah can
be my bridesmaids can you tell us a
little about career because I'm starting
soon and don't know what to expect LOL
ok i talked about curtain all my videos
but basically it's best for ever and i
love it and you should totally do it and
have fun because if you're starting it
soon you you might even like not like it
when you started I feel like I don't
really like it but you will get into it
you will love it I promise how is your
boyfriend Danny Rosh lard my boyfriend
is great today is actually our four
months today's meeting just since four
months anniversary four month
anniversary for months together and it's
also my best friend's birthday so today
is a pretty exciting day one thing you
want to do before you die that got
pretty serious pretty quickly kind of
morbid but I think I want to go bungee
jumping I was about to say cliff jumping
but in Costa Rica actually did go cliff
jumping and you I like took a bunch of
videos and pictures there and I really
want to make like a cool
like Costa Rica blog experience video so
if you want that can you thumbs up this
video if you want like a Costa Rica vlog
um I'm gonna try to like put one
together and oh I didn't get footage
from the cliff jumping on there but like
it was really fun so we like went
whitewater rafting and then we climbed
up onto this cliff and we went cliff
jumping so yeah I just do that was
really cool about you and your boyfriend
heart eyes from Carol yeah I love Justin
and I feel like everyone in my school
like everyone in my area like knows
about us but it's okay because it's all
right your favorite memory with your
boyfriend PS i love you oh my gosh i
love you too my favorite memory justin
might be one time we went sledding and
that was like really fun or just like
just like hanging up I don't know we
just like have fun on her own like he's
really funny and like pretend to be a
monkey stuff and it makes me laugh a lot
so that might be one of my favorite
memories he's gonna kill me for saying
that but it makes me laugh a lot so
that's probably my favorite memory what
color is your room PS can you film the
room to our love you so much oh my gosh
guys you're so sweet I love you too um
my room is purple and I'm in my sister's
room which is blue and the lighting I
know has probably changed drastically in
this video because I've been filming for
like 50 minutes as usual what's a gob
video if it's not 90 minutes long but um
Lucy's rooms blue and my room is purple
how do you stay in shape fitness routine
oh I made like a fitness video long time
ago but yeah it was long time ago time I
took an updated one and I just stay in
shape from like crew they're obviously
like right now I can't so we like go to
the gym and just do like winter training
and stuff and yeah I just like go to the
gym and do a lot of cardio I'll run and
go on the elliptical to equates like
i'll go on the rowing machines like
stuff like that but I just try to like
stay active sorry that's pretty general
but yeah Natalie 13 says tips for a2k
okay this is just like personally my
experience in those of you that don't do
crew like probably will you probably
can't even really like whatever just
ignore me but um my tips for 2k is like
do what you know works best for you
because I've had like all my coaches
tell me that I need to go to really high
school
great like ice cream show from them mmm
all right I just turn off the light so
sorry I just got really dark I love ice
cream I've heard koj say like as a
lightweight rower like you need to go to
really high rate so that you can you're
like pulling your weight like whatever
but like aren't asleep if coaches are
telling you to go to at a high rate I'm
like you don't think you're ready or you
think you can do just as well or better
at a lower rate just do what you want to
do because like my coach will tell me
like he needed what be about 28 the
whole time like even a 30 which is like
way too much for me like if i go to go
for 30 the whole time I'm like really
tired I by the end and I like died and
then my scores look awful in the best UK
pull the guy PR debt like I was that
like a 24 like 26 a whole time and I
know people are like you can do way
better than but for for me that's what
works the best so honestly tips for 2k
would be like do you do what you know
works for you and also for a2k like I
always do 10 strokes heart as hard as
you can at the beginning and usually
ends up being like 15 or 20 but like as
hard as you can and then just settle
into your base pace and like stick to it
through the whole time and then for the
last like minute just crank it up and go
like as crazy as you can and yeah that's
what I always do this one says what's
yours UK time right PR is a 749 92 my
splits a 157 and that's like I like okay
but I want it to be a lot better look I
know it can be my better so that's why
I'm definitely gonna be trying to work
on in the spring and this saturday i'm
actually going to a rowing competition
so hopefully i will improve their jenny
says do you love me yes I love you Jenny
