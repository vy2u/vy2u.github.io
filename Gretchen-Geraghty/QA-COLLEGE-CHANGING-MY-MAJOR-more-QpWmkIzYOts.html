Q&amp;amp;A video and I've been requested to do
this question and answer video for a
very long while now just basically at me
answering all of your rises questions
all about college for those of you that
don't know I go to Boston University I'm
finishing up my freshman year here I
just tweeted out what are your questions
all about college and I have like a list
to go through so I know I've seen before
like I know or like some pretty
frequently asked questions so I will do
my best to get to all of them so the
first question is what was your GPA in
high school and this question I actually
got when I did like a college advice
video recently I know I didn't mention
it in there I think I just forgot but my
GPA in high school is in 94 I mean I
guess that's like pretty decent I don't
I don't really know like it I guess it
just depends on what you think decent is
I try pretty hard in high school I took
several APs and yeah my GPA was 94 and
that got me where I am today I don't
know how your school does it I know like
in college at least here it's on like a
4.0 scale but in my high school it was
out of 100 another question I got is how
do you make money in college and do you
have a job so my main job right now is
YouTube it's you guys I know for a lot
of people in college it can be really
really hard to make money especially if
you're busy all the time with classes or
if you're like a student athlete or
something I know it's got to be really
hard to have a job so one company I know
about is actually called Opinion Outpost
and it's just basically this website
where you can take surveys and you can
get paid for your opinions so I think
you Opinion Outpost
for working with me on this video
because I know it's something that a lot
of college students struggle with like
everyone's broke in college and you guys
are interested I'll have it linked down
below but if you don't have time for a
job or surveys or anything I guess I
would say just save money from Christmas
and birthday is what I do too someone
said do you like you and what's your
favorite thing about it and yes I do
like video I think my favorite thing
about it is just being so close to the
city because I'm really a city person
and I just love having so many things to
do and so many like stores and
restaurants and stuff like I just love
being in the city like it makes me happy
so definitely mind if everything about
it is just being so so close to Boston
like if you know beat you it's like the
city school like you're literally in the
city so it's great what's the hardest
part of college
classes are a lot harder than high
school I noticed like I went to a pretty
good high school too and high school
wasn't like easy certainly I had classes
that were challenging but it's
definitely step up from high school and
I would say another hard part about
college is just time management we're
trying to stay active having YouTube
channel your academics with social life
like everything and I feel like in high
school you have a lot more structure in
college a lot of the time management is
up to you
so I would say that is a hard part about
college definitely this one says what is
your favorite item from Lululemon and
also about bu my favorite item from
Lululemon is probably just their wonder
unders I have like a million of just the
plain black fares I think I'm wearing
some right now yeah yeah I just like
their leggings that's not really
colorful eat it I guess it is cuz I go
there all the time like Newberry is
dangerously close go shopping way too
much and then my favorite thing about bu
well I guess I already said it it's just
like being in the city so yeah this one
says what is the best part about college
I guess this is kind of like the other
question I just answered but I realized
I really enjoyed the freedom and just
being my own like boss and like you have
to like motivate yourself and stuff cuz
in high school you have your parents and
everyone like kind of telling you what
to do but it's kind of nice in college
to just do what you want for yourself
and make your own decisions like I don't
know I think I've really enjoyed that
freedom this'n says was it hard to get
into Boston University and I'm not
really sure what this is asking I guess
I only applied to Boston University
which I think I mentioned in my other
video I do not recommend that at all and
I know on like GPA and SAT score wise
it's a pretty hard school to get into
for me I guess it wasn't hard just
because I wasn't that range and I knew
that I probably would get in try as hard
as you've had in high school to put you
in a spot where you can go to a college
that you want to this one says what is
your favorite class you're taking right
now and for those of you that don't know
some other questions were about this too
I came into my freshman year of college
as a bio major and I thought that I
wanted to major in bio and I thought I
wanted to go to dental school in first
semester I was miserable and chemistry
and biology it was very very hard a very
very rigorous like course load and I
just wasn't aware it was too
I wish someone would have told me don't
do this Gretchen so first semester I
really struggled kinda made my GPA bag
but this semester I'm loving my classes
I'm switching into the business school
officially in the fall I will be
enrolled in the quest term School of
Business so I'm so happy about that and
right now my favorite class that I'm
taking is my finance class I was not
expecting to love it as much as I did
I've never taken a finance or business
class before but I'm really really
enjoying it and I may even consider a
career in finance because I love it that
much
I was even thinking yesterday that I
wanted to be a teaching assistant in
finance length semester so maybe that'll
happen this is getting very in detail
but yeah my favorite class right now is
definitely finance this one says do you
like being away from home and would you
rather go to a closer college and I do
like being away from home in the sense
that I'm happy I'm in Boston and like in
the city and stuff and I like having
like a new environment and some I think
it's good to like branch out when you go
to college and try living somewhere new
but I definitely missed my parents so
much probably more than I thought I
would like I just think of them all the
time it's okay though I get to like text
up and call them every day but I just
miss them a lot
like Lucy and I really really close to
their parents so while it would be nice
to go to college at home to see my
parents all the time I think this is
good for me to like you know make me
grow up and live without my parents that
being said I'm very excited to be able
to spend the summer with them and I just
missed them all the time
this one says what time do you normally
go to sleep and like I mentioned in the
fall I was taking biology in chemistry
they were very very terrible classes not
too scary if you like that go for it
like I thought I did but I realized from
the first semester that I didn't and it
was almost good that I made myself go
through that to realize like I don't
enjoy taking chemistry or biology
anymore and that's okay because I loved
it all in high school so the reason I'm
saying this is because in the fall I did
not get asleep I would stay up so late
studying doing labs reading online
assignments like I just had so much work
I had to do for those classes so I
literally would go to bed so late like
past midnight like every night I'd have
to get up so early for my classes it was
just a bad situation but I'm happy to
answer this now because my New Year's
resolution
myself was to get more sleep and I can
probably say I really try to get to
meant by like 9:00 or 10:00 every night
and like last night I'm going to put it
like 8:45 the night before like 8:30 I
know it's like weird because I'm in
college my go ahead know like 8:30 like
what a loser but no it's so great and
I've noticed a difference like in my
energy and stuff and I like feel better
during the day and I'm more productive
so yeah I would say try to make it a
goal for you guys to like get to bed
earlier because it's made a difference
in my life I'm definitely noticed this
isn't said did your parents support your
decision to go away and yes they did
like 100% when Lucia and we were looking
at Boston University our parents were
totally for it my mom was one who was
like really really for it like she's
like oh I could totally see you guys
here like I love this school it's such a
good school academically like when you
graduate there will be so many
opportunities for you like career-wise
and she's like I know you guys will love
the city so our parents were totally for
it and yeah and the last one I will be
answering says West Campus vs. Warren
tower's for freshmen West is the best
but it's all I will say is the best
those are all the questions I have time
for it for this college QA if there's
any other really big questions that I
didn't address or get you you can leave
them down below and I'll try to respond
to them individually so yeah thank you
guys so much for watching and I'll see
you my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
