video and again I'm really sorry my
voice is gone right now because I'm
getting over being sick so I'm really
sorry that my voice is always scratchy
right now I apologize sincerely this is
just going to be a little Q&amp;amp;A video of
questions that you guys ask me I put out
a picture out it's okay but I said leave
your questions below and tell me a Q&amp;amp;A
and I actually got like an overwhelming
response I got over like a thousand
questions which like thank you so much
for asking your questions I can't
believe like that but maybe you took the
time to like type out questions and
stuff for me to answer there was stuff
like notice that were like quite popular
so I will answer those ones and I have a
few things just to say the beginning of
this video first of all a lot of you may
have noticed I posted it on my Instagram
which is at gotcha loves Beauty said I
have a personal Instagram which is that
Gretchen with five ends and a lot of you
have found this in the past just three
like my friends and stuff but I've now
made it public so you guys can totally
follow my personal one if you want to
it's not gonna be like YouTube related
it's gonna be more like my personal life
and like me interacting with my friends
if you guys can totally follow that to
you like you're welcome to because
YouTube is my life and I totally like
accept that and love that you can follow
my twin sister which is that Lucy
Garrity with two eyes that is our last
name and I will always feel weird saying
that because I feel people don't say
their last names on YouTube but there it
is at Lucy Garrity with two eyes and my
boyfriend Justin's Instagram is that
Justin rm5 so you can follow him if you
want and Lizzie's boyfriend's Instagram
name is that Danny Brandt so you can
follow him too I feel like it was like a
big reveal like oh here's my other
Instagram but yeah so go ahead you can
follow that one too and yeah I just have
a lot of questions from you guys that
you want me to answer so let's just jump
right into it I'm super excited so a big
one is actually where are you going to
college in the fall I've known for quite
some time I'm gnomes in the probably
December that Lucy and I are both going
to be attending a Boston University in
the fall we're going to be a part of
their rowing
we're gonna ruin their life 18 which are
super super super excited for like it's
just perfect for us and we're so excited
to row there and just the program it's
like so perfect for us the people are so
nice and so incredibly excited to go
there I can't even tell you
I couldn't even and like stayed
overnight with like the girls I'm the
team it was just perfect and I love
Boston and I love the school everything
about it so I'm just so excited and I
didn't like tell you guys at first or
anything because I didn't know if I like
showed or whatever but it's a huge
school so it was really make a
difference
pretty sure there's like 30 or 40,000
kids that go there so yes Lucy and I are
both going to Boston University and I
actually have some apparel right here
I'm super excited that I'm going there
and I feel like some of you already even
knew and yep I'm gonna be rolling there
I'm a lightweight team so I'm super
excited for that and another question
that I saw a lot was what are you
planning to major in and when I go to bu
I'm planning on majoring in biology
another question dies down here a lot is
how tall are you and how much do you
weigh and I'm 5 foot II I feel like I've
said that up but I'm like pretty tall
I'm 5 foot 8 and my weight like luck
shoe eats a lot and I feel like I said
my weight and like a video before I'm
not really sure if I have I feel like
some people aren't comfortable with her
weight but I don't really care I'm not
trying like lose weight or gain weight
or anything I'm kind of fine with it I'm
usually around I would say 127 126 I'm
like a good day 127 126 in there
usually I weigh like less than that in
the summer cuz in the summer I usually
weight less maybe like the dead of
winter a little more you know at
Christmas time probably like up in the
200s but yeah my weight fluctuates kind
of a lot but usually around in there is
one says do you have a job and actually
I have like several I would say I live
car net pulls over this summer that I
just do it as a summer job and then I
live card at the YMCA like near my house
and then I also have YouTube before I
could get a job I always like wanted
money somewhere but I didn't know how do
I know I mentioned this in videos before
but I thought it's like really helpful
for you guys it makes this website
called Opinion Outpost I'll have it
linked in the description box down below

for signing up and it's basically just a
company that you take surveys because
different companies
need your opinion for research it's
different companies through Opinion
Outpost they like want your opinions and
it's totally free to sign up so
definitely just click the link down
below if you're interested another
question I saw a lot is how did you
ingest meat and we actually met freshman
year of high school we had Spanish class
in biology class together I remember
like I didn't talk to like any boys and
he was like the only boy that gave me
the time of day so he just kind of
became friends like school friends we
like walk together in the hallways and
you would like talk to me in class and I
remember getting like so nervous that
you would talk to me I'm like why is it
boy talking to me but that's how we met
we just kind of met through like classes
we had together freshman year and we
kinda just like stayed friends since
then and then we started dating so I'm
really happy that we were like friends
first and I definitely think that when
people want to date someone they should
like be friends first because you just
get to know them so well so yes we did
meet freshman year of high school what
do you want to be when you grow up and
I'm pretty sure now that I want to be a
dentist
dante's just because it's a really
interesting to me and I had an
internship there I had lots of fun doing
it I just love working with patients and
like helping fix their teeth and I just
think it's really cool it's always
interests me and I'm really excited I
want to like go into that field says
where do you like to travel and I like
traveling anywhere where there's a beach
and it's warm Maddie says who is your
favorite cousin and clearly it's you and
your sister Mary how do you stay
motivated to be healthy usually I don't
know it's not really a problem for me
just because now even I don't even like
eating like junk food that much like I
usually my body like crazy
salads and like fruits and vegetables
and like good food cuz I just know
that's what makes me feel better
so like eating wise I don't know it's
been kind of for me to like eat healthy
and like motivated to work out it's like
I just love rowing and I love being with
the girls on my team so that's like
motivation enough for me I love rowing
and I love eating healthy so if you love
what you're doing then it's not really
hard what is your favorite thing to do
in your free time
aside from filming YouTube videos it's
probably just like hanging out and
watching like Netflix with like Lucy
you're adjusted in her yeah I just like
hanging out watching movies this one
says what is your perfect pizza ooh I do
like pizza a lot and I
like normal cheese pizza but I like
ricotta on it because I feel like the
way ricotta taste on it taste so yummy
do you have any of your non-existent
children's name picked out and I
actually do not put some of my friends
do and I think it's so funny I do not I
will have to get on thinking about that
favorite exercise for a flat stomach
splashbacks
my favorite core exercise of all time is
legless I don't know why I just love
them I can do them in my sleep like all
the time
I just love doing leg lifts they're my
favorite this one says how long have you
in jessamine together a lot of these are
about Justin I'm happy you guys like him
so much Justin and I have been together
almost a year and a half now in a month
it'll be like a year and a half how
crazy is what person do you rely on the
most and I would say it's one person I'd
say it's two people definitely my
parents mom and dad I didn't dam I just
love them so much and they support me in
everything I do so I definitely rely on
my parents I'm always gonna be a mommy's
girl and a daddy's girl I just love my
parents days Justin your first boyfriend

vlogmas next year and as of now I'm
planning on it I really like to blog was
last year so hopefully I can do that
again how many babies do you have I'm
sorry I couldn't even get for you I way
too many I don't want to think about it
favorite emoji would probably be the one
that's like you know the smiley face
that's kind of like blushing it's like I
love that one put to order at Panera and
usually I will just get a chicken Caesar
salad because that is one of my favorite
foods I love it so much are you going

going to be practicing with my rowing
team probably like two or three times a
day it's gonna be like really intense
spring training season so I can't go
anywhere over April break because I'm
going to be training for possibly Youth
Nash and also if any of you guys go

my friend Erin says she's a huge fan and
she was wondering what I eat for
breakfast to start off my day so usually
I leave toast with peanut butter and
banana not a surprise to any of you or
lately I've been eating a lot of maple
brown sugar oatmeal because maple brown
sugar oatmeal is best this one says how
did you lose 15 pounds in freshman year
and I know I mentioned this
a video before and I I feel like have a
lot to say about that so if you guys
want me to make another video on that
can you just uh mess up this video just
so that I know I will make another one
on how I like lost a bunch away even
though like I'm not way telling anyone
to lose weight but just like how I did
and I didn't even try to it just kind of
like happened because I decided it's
like the healthy person his own says
will you do a room tour and you know
what I think I will once I had hundred
thousand subscribers mark my words and I
know I've been putting it off forever
but I think I'm like twenty thousand
dish away right now
so once I had a hundred thousand I would
do room to her promised so I think that
is all the questions I have time for but

will see you right next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
