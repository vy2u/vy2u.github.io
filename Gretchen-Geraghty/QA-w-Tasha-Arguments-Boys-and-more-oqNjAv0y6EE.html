number one like nono is like to message
and like annoy other youtubers because
they're not gonna want to talk to you if
you're just like yo check out my videos
and subscribe and that's literally what
I did because I'm like she's like my
sister you know like I feel like I did
subscribe to her and then she messaged
me and she was like yeah you subscribe
to me and then like I can't occur but
that was that before YouTube like their
whole setup

inbox like where is that why does
YouTube 15 everything oh this is Charlie

flip and slide right and we change into
our bathing suits I was like carrying my
clothes out and then I must have dropped
that day the week success underwear
