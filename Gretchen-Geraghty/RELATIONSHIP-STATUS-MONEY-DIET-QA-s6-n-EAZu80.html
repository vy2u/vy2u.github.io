that why do you live in a dorm style
apartment do you have an internship are
you going back to video so yes I do have
an internship but I'm living in New York
City in the summer dough is based here
in San Francisco but I just work
remotely for them and where I'm living
it's confusing because it's like a dorm
style setup but it's just an apartment
it's not actual dorms that students will
live in during the air just intern
housing over the summer that college
students that are interns live there
what is your favorite part about working
at doe I just love it so much because I
love the after so long I love over to
Natasha and that was up my favorite
shopping app ever so so get your come
true honestly being in New York City or
Boston more I think ah Livie - Kelly

York City like I really think I'm gonna
live there after college and I just love
New York City my team says how do you
make money and you like living in New
York City basically I just making money
off of youtube and I love living in New
York City a lot of you guys do tell me
though that you don't have time for a
job you're in school you're busy
- you're wondering like how can I get

things that I want to get in called one
thing I know of is your specific website

down below as you guys can check it out
and start taking surveys today and start
making money and thank you so much a
penny outpost for sponsoring this video
he's really really personal as well
because I always kind of say to ask
personal questions because like they're
not really personal they're not fun I'm
getting the like I don't know like I
want to get to know me more
what is your most embarrassing moment
after you so I wasn't any answer is good
forget about any embarrassing moments
okay I do but like I have this ability
where I can like a race embarrassing
moments in my head
I'm not even kidding like things that
happened to me or that I get embarrassed
about people remind me of like years
later and I'm like whoa I totally forgot
that happens like in middle school high
school because like I literally just
make myself forget cuz I can't like
embarrass my I understand so it's got
seven like so I'm like okay a lot of
people hear this and questions that I
got a law or that got lots of likes I
tried to put in here yeah there's a lot
of people are wondering uh yeah this
gave a really personal really quick but
wasn't very single moment FPU is uh for
this past winter at the end of last year
I was having the what are we talk out in
front of my dorm building and um boys
drove by friends of the boy in their car
and they were like oh get it like being
obnoxious like boys and I was like wow
this is like just a really embarrassing
unfortunate moment so yeah that's that
one goes first okay
let's just address the elephant in the
room I got a million questions about
just all-encompassing relationships my
relationship status Justin my
ex-boyfriend if I'm single if I'm in a
relationship
everything about that and I'm just
decided sent overwhelmingly all the
questions I got word about that and I
understand like it's personal you guys
right now I know Justin was such a big
presence my youtube channel and also in
the last key day I said I wasn't over
him
and now I can say I am but I'm not gonna
get into that in this video I'm actually
gonna film that later today I just have
like so much I could finally tell you
guys might open up about so stay tuned
for that sorry this is kind of like a
little cliffhanger but you'll just see
that and really see what happened now
I'm not dating anyone single Pringle leg
is good what's the hard part about
college definitely the classes let's
kill a bunch my hardest ball how much do
you love being an alpha P you know the
humans like a normal person hey sorority
girl honestly the best decision of my
whole life
you're kidding no but honestly I love it
it really was a good decision
different sisters time I saw size of
classes do you take a week I've ever
done blowed I go to as many as I can but
no I haven't double what I have them
it's like they need four or five was it
hard transitioning from veganism back to
standard diet did you have to slowly
incorporate foods back in or just all at
once so I don't think it was too hard I
did get stomach ache stirs because your
stomach and your body isn't used to
eating that type of food so I definitely
incorporating it slowly I remember I
started eating dairy first and I like
hurt my stomach about to attack me but
now I'm pretty much better sometimes I
get stomachaches but that's just how I
is it very personal but I know I really
talked about it before so that's that
what is your favorite I'll sleep oh
please you've ever been to it definitely
a paradise Bowles in Manhattan Beach so
good why does your alcohol drink so I
don't drink alcohol because I'm not 21
if I did it would be it was never your
granny thing or want to go back and
change something in your childhood I
live my life with no regrets that sounds
dumb but I really try to live my life in
Hillcrest
what are your in Lucis middle names my
middle name is Inga and this is my name
is a Margaret your parents feel are
living in York City for the summer they
are so supportive of me and I guess it
wasn't really their decision that sounds
bad but I mean sort of decided for
myself since I'm 20 years old and I paid
for my apartment I pay rather by fluid I
pay for everything so they don't really
have to worry about supporting me paying
for me so it kind of was my decision and
you haven't totally supported they miss
me of course by you to visit home a lot
and hopefully they'll visit me a couple
times
Claire says what part of York City do
you live near and what parts you
recommend to visit when they're
basically before I live there I would
only ever go to like Soho just a week
sitting for like as the best shopping so
I actually love so much you like their
it's a fun area there's no restaurants
and stuff
like at East Village of town we get tiny
bit more and I really love the know how
easy Village area like I love it there
that's where I want to live after
college so I would recommend just
visiting no home are you happier now
that you've been more open about not
being vegan anymore so yes definitely
happier there's no I wrote on the
lightweight team at BU my help freshman
year of college when my own is a part of
the rowing team I couldn't even talk
about it so it sort of was the same
situation with not being vegan anymore
which sounds silly but like not being
able to tell you guys just a main person
like that kind of killed me and like I
don't like feeling like I can't tell you
things if I was just so scared of with
the Curtis system he thought I was gonna
get people have been really cool so
definitely happier probably gonna get
any comfortable this would be about it
the like time you see yourself turning
youtube into a full career once you
graduate or you can continue vlogging
your video channel after you graduate I
do plan on continuing evolving or at my
channel after I graduated I do not see
myself turning it into a full-time
career because I've always obviously
prioritize my education and that's why I
go to Boston University and I'm working
towards like a real degree I can have
instead of just trying to go for
suitable time which I need so awesome
that people do that but I just have
always kind of wanted that the
traditional career and I'm not sure that
is yet but I think that I will just get
to read how early did you apply for this
internship do they require prior
experience to be eligible I would love
to do something like this in the future
Tasha I got really lucky and we didn't
have to apply or interview or anything
for this internship just because we had
worked with dough for a while just on
our YouTube channel that was really
helpful since they kind of reach out to
us more like hey you want to be
insurance for us and we were like yeah I
mazing so we just kind of got lucky for
that and if I thought good for the
internships it's just like apply to
place that you've been you can really
see yourself you feel more comfortable
living in Boston in New York City where
do you feel like you thrive the most and
you can be yourself the most
honestly New York City I've just had
such a fun time for summer I'm a little
biased because summer is usually a lot
more fun what do you think is most
important in life I think the most
important in life is surrounding
yourself with great people like Tasha
and just like friends and family what
it's like being away for Lucy for so
long at least I misheard
and how tall are you 5 9 I think that's
a good place to end oh wait Beleza my
believes that I love you I miss you
shout out to Louisa a new friend to call
Adriana I love you thank you guys so
much for watching this video and I'll
see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
