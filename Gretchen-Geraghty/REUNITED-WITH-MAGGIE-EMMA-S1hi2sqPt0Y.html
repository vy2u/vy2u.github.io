screwed it up and I put it in there but
it was on boil so then only the top half
was like toasted but the bottom half was
like frozen from the freezers too so but
I figured it out don't worry I just I
just flipped it over
not that you guys was boring coming over

so maybe that exam is way harder than we
thought psych 101 is probably the
easiest class offered at BU literally we
just simply didn't do it we just weren't
prepared and we did study just like not
as much as we could have
there are many ganas or external factors
yeah we're gonna have our self-serving
bad first blame is Abbey foster she
knows when we trying to study yeah
second is whether there you go okay pop
the string in the rain and then you go
to bed study out that's distracting
something about us playing inside the
Sun oh Jesus so sore up and I just feel
so tired now I'm like I should have just
not even bothered studying because I
know it's so bad and I should I just
left don't win that the person that was
like handed their testing before me with

duet midnight tonight
