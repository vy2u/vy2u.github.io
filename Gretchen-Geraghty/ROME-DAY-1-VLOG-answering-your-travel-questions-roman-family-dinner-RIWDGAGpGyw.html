know I get it
good morning world
good morning guys we are waking up here
in Florence oh I'm so confused because I
think we're not still in Florence cuz
we've been here for so long now you know
yeah um yeah we're still in Florence
we're about to leave to go on our little
bus to Rome because today we're going to
Rome and it's so weird that it's the
last city that we're gonna be in in
Italy because I feel like our plane
landed literally 10 seconds ago
look I really we just got here and it
just like whips by so quick and oh yeah
I wanted to talk more and today's vlog
about EF trips in specific because I've
been getting so many questions on vlogs
and I've been posting or Italy already
well okay yep ultimate break I keep
calling it EF travel and just like EF
like no it's EF ultimate break that's
what it's called and I you probably
heard me call it the wrong thing and
blogs before but yeah so me and Maggie
are here with EF ultimate break and
basically cuz I've been getting so many
questions I'll just explain it they have
like they're like a travel tour guide
company and as like a travel company
it's so nice being on a trip that's like
organized by them because everything is
like planned out um we have a tour guide
that like lives here in Florence but is
like he's actually from Chicago he's
from America Oh
some of you were commenting to you that
you like have been on trips with Tyson
before so that's like so funny in like
such a small world and if you know him
like he's the best but um
yeah I recommend I said but yeah so
basically they just have like tour
guides that will like lead your trip and
it's so nice because they'll have like
tours planned out for like the cities
you go to and they'll bring you to like
really cool restaurants and they know
like all the best places to go obviously
like especially you Tyson because he
lives in Italy and like wine tours and
like we went to Tuscany and then we like
went in the vineyard and then like we
have pasta making classes which is gonna
be like I'm so excited about the
itinerary and I think that's in Rome
right yeah and then we'll go to like um
oh my gosh wait don't tell me the Trevi
Fountain is that what it's called it's
like the most like iconic one oh my god
let's women I don't know but I'm like
we're gonna go there like they take you
to like
the best spot so yeah basically it's
been really great I'm trying to think if
I have any other questions Oh someone
was asking if we stayed like in a hostel
or hotel I think technically the one
that we're at here in Florence is a
hotel I think it's more of a hotel than
the last places and it's like they're
like these cute little bungalows oh I'll
just tell you what it's called because I
mean we're not gonna be staying here
anymore when you see this anyway um it's
called camping firenzi but it's just
like all these separate little bungalows
it kind of just reminds me of hotels
that you go to that are like all
separate little um not like cabins but
do you know what I mean like little
little rooms or just like single rooms
all by themselves with like a little
space in between yeah bungalows see like
the next one's like right over there so
that's what this is and then in Venice
we stayed in a hostel I know but what I
heard is that like hostels in Europe are
really different from hostels in America
like everyone in their 20s and you're up
like goes to hostels and I think in
America's just less of a thing but like
when you're traveling around Europe like
everyone uses hostels and it was like
super nice literally the only difference
I noticed from like a hotel versus a
hostel was that there wasn't like soap
like we brought our own soap and there
were still towels and there was still a
bed and a shower and a mirror and a
toilet and like you mean like it was
still normal and you guys saw our vlogs
and they're like it I just felt like it
was like a normal room is the name of it
right here of the first puzzle that
we're at in case you're like interested
and going or if you go on this same EF
trip oh wait I should tell you so I know
I've been talking about my instagrams
just so I could tell you guys but I'll
tell you right now I know you can use it
Gretchen 100 for a hundred dollars off
of a trip of your own well I just like
tripped over my words Kristin 100 for
$100 off a trip of your own and yeah I
just think that's such a great idea
everyone here that we're with we were
talking to them about like why they came
on the trip with the F because you guys
know Maggie and I obviously are like
working with them and got to come which
is like the best thing ever and
literally a dream come true because I
love traveling so much and yeah it's
been so fun but everyone we've been
talking to you and like everyone on our
trip there's like in our 20s a lot of
people are in college a lot of people I
just graduated and there's like some
couples that just really wanted to
travel together and like didn't want to
have to like research about everything
literally you just like pay one amount
and like everything is covered like
where you're staying like a bunch of
food they plan out like all of the day
so you're doing like all the fun things
that you want to do and like thank
you're in seing the culture and stuff
without like research I don't know I've
been talking about this for so long but
I could just talk about it forever I
think it's so great and I know so many
of you that have been commenting on my
videos or my Instagram have traveled
with EF ultimate break before so I think
I can link our specific tour that we're
on down below
so you can see the exact trip or on its
the Venice Florence Rome wine because
those were like the three cities we go
to obviously I'm trying to think about
any other questions you guys might have
if you have any more questions about
like the tour itself or like you have
ultimate break you can leave your
questions down below because I'd love to
help you guys out because I know so many
of you were like interested in traveling
and I feel like Maggie and I have a lot
of tips because we've traveled a lot and
actually at all but you know I think I'm
gonna make it a surprise I'm gonna be
surprised we're here all I'm gonna say
is have I mentioned it in a video before
but I always do this I like think I can
make a surprise and then I'm like talked
about it before okay yeah I don't think
I have I don't know why I haven't just
cuz I like think I was gonna keep it too
sensible but actually a couple days
after we get back from Italy we're going
somewhere crazy and really fun and it
was super last-minute but I'm so excited
and it's just gonna be a wild ride so
yeah that's that um anything else about
EF I don't know oh actually right now so
it is 9:05 I'm Maggie and I are like
still jet left like I thought that I
wasn't jet lagged because the first day
I just stayed up the whole time lunch
about it like normal bedtime got up in
the morning but like Maggie and I find
ourselves staying up til 3:30 every day
and like being hungry because we're like
oh it's like 9:00 p.m. at home like that
makes sense that we're hungry now yeah
like dinner I almost didn't like yeah so
it's been hard and then we get up in the
morning we have like peel ourselves out
of bed we're like oh my god we're so
tired so we were so tired right now but
that's a guy and we're gonna I keep
almost choking oh my god we're gonna go
hop on the bus um I need to stop talking
so I can just show you today because
it's gonna be really fun because we're
arriving in Rome and I can't wait and
people love Rome and they said that
cannolis are the best in Rome and
yesterday we got a cannoli that was like
okay but I like a good cannoli you know
is so happy look at how full it is you
even have the extended part out right
dad I think Maggie and I are gonna have
to bring another bag back oh yeah if you
come on a trip like this or even just I
guess traveling in general like because
you're gonna buy pack light and you're
gonna buy stuff for like your friends
and your family and make especially like
Maggie's never been to Europe before
like do you wanna get cool Stephanie
Gretchen I'm not getting you guys I
think this is really funny I don't know
why we got these bracelets and these are
like to get breakfast here and all the
other days we actually slept through
breakfast here in Florence which I don't
condone that eat breakfast but Maggie
and I like I said I've been so jet like
saying I'm so late that like we like
sleep through breakfast and literally
it's so hard to get up but then once
we're up and out and like in the Sun
we're like fine and then we'll just like
grab breakfast later like door during
one of the tours or like wouldn't be a
free time in the morning um but I just
think it's really funny that we have
these bracelets dude we never even put
them on but if you stay here
look at these bracelets for breakfast
have a little breakfast bar yeah okay I
need to stop filming inside please look
at how beautiful it is outside
Maggie's with the boys fastest oh my
gosh just looks so good that looks way
better when I got that memories I got
that truffle oil pasta at the other
place it tastes like a bottle of truffle
oil but that looks really good I got
plain yours I've been missing plane yeah
and Maggie that is like the cool that's
we get it it's like spicy J I hope I
don't know what they're like there's no
thick and squishy and we got caprese and
that was the best Parade ever
ocular it's so amazing
I wish it was really good okay actually
I feel like one second which got pop so
wet really
we have like an hour and a half left I'm
driving to Rome
he's driving back
my god guys this is our that might fun
for me to go to it's like a million
stories and she said it's like unreal
and me and my here's our doubt we were
just home in these arms are you gonna do
yeah our tour guide right now is pace
tonight or leader and they ever a little
earbuds in and these are actually so
smart I never like me what they are and
they only have one so that you can like
hear what's going on in here are you
saying and then I think we're gonna go
to the Trevi Fountain and then we're
having our big hair oh yeah
this is Rome so far
it's so cool
taury
we just said that they measured this
whole things like strings and you could
fit a perfect spear in here spear that
sphere like this to the ground is
exactly the same as like all the way
around like point to point
see that was really cool guys Italy's
first King is buried over there and
Italy's second Kings buried over there
like in here I look in office place is
so cool
getting back in wondering why the middle
was blocked off right above like the
light up there but it's not a light with
a glass or anything he's like there's no
saran wrap it's literally a hole it's
like a straight hole it needs to get to
play incredible coming here when it's
raining because I just like they just
let it rain inside and go down drains
quickly
yeah I was not look I'm like really
shook that they just they literally just
let it rain all over the ground right
there and there's like dreams in the
middle of the floor and he's like the
room and that's just how they did it
I'm like really chef what I'm learning
so many new things he was writing in the
next couple days and we're here we have
to like run down here so we can see it
cuz it's like incredible like imagine
seeing it just rain you got sick I'm
