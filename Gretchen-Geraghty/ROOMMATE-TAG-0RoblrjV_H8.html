filming the roommate tag basically it's
just a bunch of questions we just looked
it up and there's like 21 questions and
we're just gonna jump right into it whoa
also fun fact makai is leaving me in a
couple hours and of course we wait to
film this video until Matt we've been
roommates for like what eight months
yeah and we're not filming it till the
night before she's leaving so we've been
talking about we'll get to it so first
one did you guys know each other before
you became roommates um sort of that
really like no I just remember over this
summer we got like introduced and I was
like mmm like after orientation ended I
went over to the boathouse and we were
there at like the same time it just kind
of worked out that way yeah what did you
guys initially think of each other the
first time you met I just thought you're
like really put together and that's like
oh my god what are we gonna mix up into
like it was gonna be a disaster
because I never do my makeup like
anything I was looking like when I first
met you you were so put together and
like you just looked so East Coast II I
was like looking your pictures on
Facebook too and I was like oh my god
yeah and that was before I knew that you
were a youtuber um and really that's
like not me at all my life is in
shambles the first time I met you I
remember I was like oh my gosh she has
to be so cool cuz she's from California
like this is gonna be so awesome it's
like room with someone from California
and then when I actually met you I was
like aren't you so cute and I like I
remember your hair I liked your hair
because it was curly that's vibrant and
I was like this is gonna be great
how long did it take until you guys
became friends we're still not friends I
think I don't know just like radio and
we've always just been friendly yeah I
don't think there was a
we weren't friends yeah I only remember
one fight we had but maybe that's a
question later or that wasn't even
really a fight it was just me being like
a brat what you guys usually argue about
I remember what it used to be for me but
I've been good recently uh you know we
haven't we haven't had an issue and the
bananas were a problem like literally
said there's like five there right now I
would stack a bunch of bananas on my
desk and in the beginning of the year we
had a bunch well not we I had a bunch
that were like got really kind of old
and like brown and I just left them
there
and it attracted fruit flies
Mikhaylovich yeah because we had so many
what was it was like you got flowers for
something yeah times oh no it was not
about Valentine's Day I mean it was my
anniversary nice of an anniversary and
Houston like sent flowers or brought
flowers or somehow there were flowers
here yeah and it was so awful like her
entire side of the room I'm like wow
what is one thing that really bothers
you that your roommate does do you know
what you know I can't really think of
anything but I can't even say that
you're messy cuz like I'm just as messy
as you and for both medical you're like
bill for each other I don't think
anything really obvious mean and you're
like quiet in the morning mean you threw
up so the only things like I can think
of is the alarm clock going
oh wait like 10 times before she turns
it off no I sleep there my arms oh it's
a real thing mm-hmm do you guys both
have the same passion for makeup no I
feel like I used to like being to make
up more and but I still like really love
makeup and like over the summer I'll
probably like to put more time into it
but I feel like this year I like more
often that I just would go to class with
like no makeup on and just be like on
whatever I'm more together this year
that I have been really in the past
I like the opposite I'm like let's put
together really colleges may be really
sweats every day yeah
like I have to get up in the morning get
my day started like I don't have a
choice
yeah so I think because of that I just
like helps you yeah
carry about carry on my day what does
she think of your YouTube um I actually
think it's really cool I remember when
you told me like you texted me this
summer I was so like you're just telling
like three days before we got here and
you were like oh by the way I have a
youtube and so I'd liked you up and I
was like oh my god this is insane
yeah and then but I remember like
texting I was like I think that's really
cool like anybody knows about it I
remember I wonder if any of us watching
this video remembers I remember vlogging
over the summer and I'm like guys I'm
about to text my roommate I have a
YouTube channel I was against so what
scared to tell her I'm a pretty powerful
so I wasn't even remembers that but yeah
I'm just so scared you but I do not
think yeah you're like very supportive I
feel like you've taken it the best way
and then cuz I I feel like some people
are just like all weird about it but
you're like um who spends the most time
getting ready in the morning
honestly I think we both get ready
pretty quick I mean I feel like toss up
cuz like 10 15 minutes really out the
door yeah sometimes I'll drag my feet
and it'll take me like two hours to get
ready but yeah other times it's like
fast turnaround because I'm late yeah I
gotta go yeah liquid pens on the deck
what was something that you two didn't
notice about each other until you became
roommates when I had a really good laugh
I didn't really know before but I love
your laugh I guess I'm doing second yeah
I guess I just noticed like you're
entertaining ah yeah oh he's like a mess
and have so many issues I'm just like
listen to this wait do you guys
sometimes get fed up with each other
from seeing each other too often I don't
think so because our schedules really
pretty different in the spring semester
we've seen each other more because like
in the fall I literally at class like
every single hour every day was like
terrible so I feel
never even really saw her that much in
the fall and then like in the spring we
saw each other more but still you're
losing prints oh yeah it's not like
we're like in here like all day every
day like yeah I mean it's like kill each
other's we definitely have different
schedules like I feel like and Paul we
never saw each other like I was always
just like she got back to the room yeah
how do you to avoid tension while living
together I guess it's just like being
respectful I physically both isn't like
really good about it like I'm not gonna
be like I would just you know Justin
sleeping over every single night like
yeah some people in this building that
we know have boyfriends people over
every night like I would never do that
or like I would never like watch a movie
all night long with like no headphones
in or something like I know what some
some of my friends like the roommates
like never use headphones in their like
commenting to bed or like they like have
the lights on herself
yeah um times I have the lights on you
probably want to like shoot me and
occasionally like honestly I don't know
I feel like I can sleep through a
hurricane yeah I like easygoing
what's one rule you guys have while
living together no banana no banana but
she breaks that rule how do you deal
with sharing a bathroom oh it's kind of
different cuz I go home floor like it's
like a community bathroom share I guess
in general we just have we of doing your
shoes it was so girls we had the Oliver
and then my RA was like Gretchen like
you need to wear shoes like you don't
know it's like on those floors and I was
like okay you're right so like that foot
fungus is yeah like the first couple
weeks I was like I don't use but like
don't worry guys actually wear shoes now
you only time it make you so know like
whatever how do you make two separate
dinners that night
oh that's kind of not really applicable
to us and feel like oh they got me home
and stuff yeah but we usually don't eat
together yeah I have like different
schedules like food wise because all
actually I think he did it earlier than
usually I think would better layer and
link it up earlier so we're just kind of
yeah my days kind of like shifted
forward yeah nationalities then some
random nationalities maybe like American
do you see roommates things without
asking I don't think so
I think I maybe know stolen like food
before or like utensil or like a plate
or if I text you and I'm like hi hi my
name into butter I saw some of yours or
mom like I took your hope you don't look
like there was the time I stole your
headband that was bad day it was not
having it we've been like good about
that cuz it's not like I'm like wearing
your stuff every day I'm a road warrior
bu sweatshirt at that one time I love
that right boyo what are your favorite
things that you like to do with each
other

think of my fall semester I just think

our bonding moment so literally fish
