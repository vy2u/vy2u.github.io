whoa because last night was Halloween it
was super fun and now I'm just qualified
to class I have a team meeting first
procore I'm just wearing like literally
really comfy clothes today and like
sneakers because I just wasn't feeling
it yeah I'm going to Seoul tonight and
that he saw something really fun
hopefully I remember to vlog that I mean
so batter like remembers to vlog or my
camera and maybe today's the day will
meet my core team maybe not when they
stood about before cords I have to do so
I just got back from class and I brought
my blog camera and of course it just old
at all because typical me but I'm just
feeling it so what tired I like it's not
that I slept a lot last night but I
really didn't because it was Halloween
and we had some fun festivities and I
didn't go to bed till super late and I
got about seven like ready for the day
like I don't know what it is with me
this your eyes but I never used to be
like an early rise or anything but I
literally get up at like six or seven
every day and like I'm up and like I'm
ready and I know I talked about this a
million times
but I know a lot of it is because like
my wall of windows right there obviously
it's bright early so then that just
makes me like a wake but I like not even
like a wake like oh I'm like tired awake
but like I'm off like I'm ready awake I
don't know but then if I don't sleep
like enough hours then it like hits me
later in the day and I like crash and
I'm just like I just want to cuddle on
mine I'm so tired
oh and I did my own laundry yesterday
finally like I mean wash my badly my
sheets and stuff and I was so lazy last
night when I came back that like unmade
but what I love about my at least some
mattress is that it's literally just
like comfy and I mean when I first
thought it I was like I don't even want
to put sheets on my bed and I'm almost
like Gretchen but sheet on your bed but
like you don't even need to like this is
what I do when I'm really lazy and I
just use my pillows without pillowcases
and everything is great in the war I
stole it so in there you Nattie and then
we're gonna get dinner then we're gonna
come back and try and dresses cuz I put
your dresses and we dresses you know
we event that when you dresses for so
yeah you can do it again do it again
your house different is a shorter wait
really
they're normally like looks different
than normal
oh my I gotta go
this is so explicit there's so much
alcoholic beverages in the back but
don't worry we have a roommate that is
21 okay is she 22 she met him 22 not you
I wish she was you but it's not okay bye
have a great night man love you bye
hello guys it is me I am back Michael
and guess who's the biggest idiot and
didn't even bring their camera with him
Oh yep that's me I did it you just
really don't even forgot it it was
really fun because my roommate Lee's
first time and it was a really good
class with Jonny it really could miss it
today it was killer really fast pace
who's like dripping in sweat like dying
but me and daddy love him so it was so
good and I wish I brought this like it
blogs and daddy leaves in it and then
after we're gonna get it
sweet bean and then we were like wait
really guy in hungry I think cuz it was
like such an intense class like victims
when I work out like really really hard
I'm just like so tired and like dripping
sweat after that I'm like I have not
even hungry right now does that make
sense I don't know it's like when Baton
Rouge we added all came three creams and
now it's like eleven and I just rated
low cereal so much probably something
could mean dinner we should learn to
address them too many guys are really
quick so if you saw Orleans one of his
most recent vlogs because there's a girl
at the end which honestly was really
exciting to me I just don't hit
something special let me just describe
all of them to you guys I've talked
about this in videos before parents
different than most guys okay gives you
so focus I'm some I got really liked
about him like being for real I really
do like that I haven't cuz he's not like
most guys and he just like is so hint
and I really like that he's not me
but if it's girls who he made up at him
has one of his most recent blocks and
never saying that she didn't look like
me and it's because it wasn't me and
yeah I'm just really sad and I don't
know what I should like bring it up with
him um but I'm just really sad no but
yeah I look like I was unless it on
Halloween it was totally fine we're good
we're chillin we're friends and we're
like always gonna be friends guys I just
I don't know what you never black thing
you don't need to do that in a video and
I was like Kenny like I'm actually gonna
do it actually it's being for real like
Arlen is like I'm just gonna say nice
things about now that I just gave me
crap and so we he cheated on me which no
we were dating never we're never hooked
up is that where you say how do you do
like we're not gonna like we're just
buddies like honestly are like such a
good guy like he's so like focused and
driven like efficient and that's
something I really admire and I like
aspire to be more like that because I'm
willy nilly all over the place like I
can't be focused or like prioritize my
things that need to be done like for
example it's 11 p.m. right now right I
have two assignments to a minute that
I've started to like maybe instead I
think video where I should've been doing
back you know I mean like whatever I was
just really good at with that stuff and
like getting a lot done he does
everything you know and I'm always like
I want to be the person that you like to
everything does over time it's hangs out
with her friend goes and explores takes
cool pictures and videos like everything
in one day I don't know I feel like he
has a really good like a balance going
on
so yeah another 30 bucks I still need to
go shower but first time I do those
homework assignment today college yeah
okay okay
good work um I'm I'm really upset with
the what you've done to be able to get
sliders nope I'll just leave because
