so today we are doing a relationship
advice video it was requested in the
past and then I thought it'd be a good
idea to film with my friends because we
all have like different experiences and
everything like that and then um so I
put a picture on Instagram and you guys
left your questions including some of my
friends from school all right Tyler
grant Oh Justin diamond you really want
to be near basically the boys protein
anyone else like if you watch those
videos right now it's just like a shout
out to you because you want one shout
out to my fans bang bang oh wait can I
just throw in your anyway some of you
think I like to smoke no that's just my
voice sorry
yeah just question one what do you think
about high school relationships as for
relationships are good
don't freak it doesn't work out yeah
what is your opinion on friends with
benefits
I feel like friends with benefits always
ends a trend like someone like you
normally write like you're gonna have
feelings for them and then it's gonna
get really rough how do you know if
someone likes you probably you don't
like because people try to like talk to
you a lot or they might like be like
touchy you know I mean like felt like
yeah rub up against you or though just
like they'll be like hey what's up
delicate like how do you how do you get
guys to be interested in you become your
friend before you like take it well yeah
well like a lot of people like you can't
expect like like someone really have a
thing with them if you're not press
first I like my guy best friend and I
told him so now it's awkward how can I
change
back to being normal and not awkward
well okay now it's kind of awkward
because you told them that you like them
but you probably just have to try to
like talk through it if you're best
friends before and it's not gonna be a
normal said it's not gonna be the way it
was before cousin told me you liked him
but like we didn't talk it out and maybe
it'll be okay that is the struggle my
girl I am sorry how do you get over a
guy when you think he still might like
you maybe like there's like reasons why
you shouldn't be with them oh go on to
the next guy what do you do if a guy
really likes you but you don't like him
back you definitely be nice to them and
like let them down you like don't be
like a bitch and be like it you're gross
and marry because that's me hey it's
Joey again our first kiss oh oh yes yeah
sure sure
let him down easy like you have to be
straightforward with him and tell him
that you don't like him because if not
yeah they're still nice to him he will
think you like it yeah like being nice
I'm isn't gonna solve it I feel like
what to do you like sighs I'm literally
just tweet under like Jeff aknowledge
yeah how do you build a stronger
relationship with your guy friend become
better friends just like talk to them
more and like hang out with them and
like make plans and stuff I talked to
the more persons like that can be like
accomplish so much more than like so
long of texting if you like hang out
with them a couple of times like you'll
feel a lot more comfortable around that
ways will be weird and they'll like text
you and you don't even talk to him in
person like that's probably open to all
of us because boys are weirdos but
literally if you're a boy and you're
watching this right now and you look
like a girl do not text reverse if you
don't know each other like definitely I
know it's awkward but like talk to her
in person first because it's like I did
a lot of watching it away but never
because like texting them is so good and
saying I don't feel it relax
and then look you see there's some
person that it's awkward and it's weird
yeah yeah yeah but girls but most girls
will just straight up reject or the
thirties so let's you know if you know
your friend talks about it you know
they're people but when you ask her she
denies it that's not a friend
yeah that's not good she likes not like
don't be friends with this girl she's
lying about you and denying you talk to
her like just like straight up you like
you would say it's my name I would mind
to ask the guy out I really think it
should be the guy that makes the first
move so if you think you like a guy a
newbie he likes you like wait for him to
make the first move I'd say because yeah
you should ask him out like we wouldn't
ask you about they like to be the one to
initiate the date yeah I want to be like
a Sande don't make them feel like Emily
every year and they don't like that
sorry like this guy he's really cute and
he has great everybody dresses poorly do
you have any advice on what I should say
to dress and nicer clothing like brandy
melville Charlie Roachy 11 if you like
where's bran available Oh like I know
he's a keeper
you know yeah he has the flow NES pretty
well what do you do if your friend is
embarrassed to be around you and doesn't
ever want people to know then they're
not a real friend and you need to find
this person
what do you do the person you like likes
your friend okay in the person you
always like your friend that's gonna be
when you're on no actually you're not
you like likes your friend if your
friend knows that you like him then they
should be even a friend to not yeah you
probably stay away from it but the guy
likes your friends like you shouldn't
try and like change it or like break
them up like you should just try it okay
how do I tell someone I like them
without it being awkward leave a
you got to know them before yes a
anything gonna feelings because if you
don't know them and then you just
proclaim love for them they're gonna be
weirded out they say hi page hi gage how
do you get a guy to start noticing you
in the shallow ease of like skinny yeah
other than like physical things like
trying to dress differently or look
differently like just like like you
should just try to talk to him yeah like
be his friend first you like have a
class with a guy you like you could just
like read and we like start talking
about homework and then if you like
branch it was like that how do I get a
guy to like me and how do you how do I
get a boyfriend yeah don't just have a
boyfriend to have a boyfriend have way
up as you like someone like you care
about I
like so many people just get a boyfriend
because they're like I want a boyfriend
but like really you should feel like
there's you yeah I'm not against someone
to like you don't pretend to like be
someone your Doc's like if you're gonna
date for a while they're gonna obviously
figure out that's not who you are
wait this this one's kind of weird it
says how to friendzone a guy which is
like I think you're kind of saying like
maybe a boy likes you but you don't like
him back so you just want him to be
friends with you like is there like a
stupid like you have to be
straightforward and tell them that you
just want to be friends with them I mean
if they're constantly texting you like
back off and like don't answer for a
while and if they compliment you just be
like hahaha you're so nice
what's the first thing you see in a guy
eyes first thing I probably know better
i definitely when i first like
especially if the guy is a lot of sweat
i just have a shot his personality can
see that his bug is evident yes why I
like him I like even man let's say I
don't know Lucy how do you run I like
them season the buzzwagon St you know
the guy you're dating is playing you
probably they won't be that nice you
obviously they talk to other girls like
there's a good clear give me yeah and
you should I think if you're like if you
think that he's playing you he's
producing problem he's like distracted
when you're together or he's obviously
not listening to you if you do when
you're stuck in between two incredibly
sweet guys
honestly though are this is so hard like
struggle you think it's really long
Marissa me I'm like a conversation with
two hours district basis is yeah this is
like like Dhoni if you're stuck between
two guys honestly you really need to
just think about like pros and cons like
where do you see yourself like who do
you see yourself oh no they're always
like well enough to like know which one
yeah is better for you and like you need
to just think
you know and like really thinking about
it and like see who you like would see
yourself in the future with it like if
one person has like different goals than
you know that it's like not gonna work
with who you are as a person and in a
way like if you started with one and
then another one comes along and you're
like you probably it like the first one
enough right yeah they're looking to oh
yeah I wanna be yeah but if you're like
really like I don't know no one else
comes in here that I just on either side
of this like if you can't pick between
two people I think it's just weird that
my boyfriend wants to go through all of
my text messages when I'm texting yes
yes yes like he like your boyfriend why
she should yeah your boyfriend should
trust you and you should be able to have
guy friends iran's are getting away
right now talking to people and I
literally third me all the time and
whenever we hang out or go to parties
they're always in oh I'm gonna get so
annoying and they always try to set me
up with people and I don't know how to
handle it cuz it gets annoying I think
it's like third mailing is like your
basic question just like find other
people to hang out with jealously don't
you yeah I don't there because I don't
just be awkward in your third-wheeling
though like think you won I heard we are
actually with a boyfriend on the daily
hi third wheel it's okay it's like a
warning three I know okay like in the
hallway times they're reeling you guys
cuz you guys are so cute this one says
do you actually get the butterflies when
you meet the guy of your dreams
I don't think okay that'd be crazy my
ability knew honestly I don't think you
have to like it might like develop over
time
I might not think you like you're in
love with someone but then like it could
like happen I mean if you're meeting I'm
like the first time you I like this
person a lot yeah I guess 16 year olds
we were very unqualified answer
questions about guys seriously yeah yeah
this one says how do you open up and not
be so shy you know tell me we're scared
of rejection so they're just like shy
and stuff I feel like you kind of just
have to like push through it how do you
get over a broken heart ice cream you
get a flex food there you go how do you
keep the conversation going and
conversation starters don't like don't
be scared just like talk about whatever
you talk to like any of your friends
would like just pretend like you're like
close with him I don't know that's what
I do
I just like saying anything that comes
to mind conversation starters can just
be like yeah
random anything you have in common or
anything to do with school or sports or
like whatever how to deal with having
something with a guy who's a senior and
you or any younger good news leaving
next year I would say cherish the shine
you have with them but like I don't know
like gonna I don't know the
long-distance thing yeah yeah you should
let them like have their college
experience I know like you think that
you can make the long-distance work and
like trust me like I understand that
like wish you like them enough but
you're gonna run out of things to talk
about when you live so far right you're
never meant it's not going to be worth
it you're not gonna want that that would
be like your senior year your junior
year when they're in college like you
can you live your life - yeah I'm not be
worrying about them like what are they
doing in college otherwise about why I'm
gonna change relationships I'm like do
you think they can work and like I think
it may be like a really good
circumstance if you really like the
person and you don't talk about it a lot
and like if you keep in contact and
maybe but like other than that I think
it's kind of hard to make it work but if
you think you can with that person in
you're really close then maybe again
think long-distance relationships are
challenging and like your feelings can
still be there but being with that
person is actually really hard because
like you don't see them and they
obviously look far away and like you can
all still carry those feelings but being
committed to them is a different thing
and like trusting those different things
so if you talk about it it can work if
you talk about it anything else it's not
going to work that you have to like come
to terms with that oh this one's eyes
are even a relationship I Gretchen loves
beanie yes I have Justin you will be in
a video so you too if your boyfriend is
friends with guys with bad habits like
smoking and drinking or I'm gonna even
say if your boyfriend has been smoking
and drinking like if you really think
smoking and drinking like isn't cool at
all then like don't be with someone that
smokes and drinks because it will
ultimately just like make you upset if
you're really really against it you
should know that like they're not the
right person brilliant on this one sighs
well I'd be forever alone I've never had
a boyfriend you and I missed off
literally don't worry about it like I
was a sophomore
last year and I never had a boyfriend
until this year like don't worry about
it husband sighs do you think it's okay
for a girl to ask a guy out honestly no
unless you know they're gonna say yes
and it's like yeah I think we're for
relationships but I got we know it can
be hard so like don't try and force one
about yeah and don't make someone change
you
that's so yeah sound can I see don't go
looking for anything you'll find someone
yeah oh yeah if you look like somebody
did you interview like in a relationship
with them like people always have
something to say like oh it's try to get
involved with your relationship and you
need to just like know how you feel and
not let anyone else say affect it
ignore everyone else like they will just
try to like get involved or like be
annoying and like that only one you also
might you feel about the person yeah
yeah and if it does then it's ignore
right don't listen to the haters yeah
seriously
bye everyone like everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
