it's Alisa and Beacon Hill and went to
her once before in Chestnut Hill and it
was really cool so I'm excited to go to
class again today and today is like the
first movie I look up and it's like
super even my voice isn't like
yeah like anyone here is perfect thank
you
the soul was awesome it was a really
good class I love Lisa I would highly
recommend her I remember that she had
really really really awesome music when
I had her in Chestnut Hill and like she
disappoint her music was so good it's
just like really current funny music
like I don't know if like Bona yellow is
in there and I was like oh my gosh I
said you can just really jam house yeah
it was a great class and I really
enjoyed going at like 7 a.m. because
then you just get it over with and now
it's only 8 and I'm like bad and I'm
gonna shower and then I go to classroom
12 site you like productive on line guys
something really unfortunate happened
when I was showering I had my phone
balancing up there I don't know why
thank God I have a life proof case right
guys Wow highly recommend for moments
like that when you play music when
you're showering in your phone in the
toilet I showed the vlogs everyone my
phone all clean when I made a sauce
labels and they look really tasty are
they good so I'm going to class now I'm
wearing at the acutest run forever from
honey bum I'm like obsessed with it I
will
he's capabilities and I'm taking me
pretty far right thing yeah
gravity date right now
[Laughter]
everyone made it out of the movie
without I wasn't without crying too much
no with crying a lot of much me and I we
cried so much and I actually thought it
would be like funny if we like vlog
after like sobbing but then once it
actually happened I wasn't in the mood
because I was really really sad so I was
like I'm not walking that's like pull
some spongebob so that I'm not is that
because I always do that okay I just had
things but yeah just made me feel really
grateful for everything I do have and
really sad because honestly Patriots day
is sadder I will say that because
Patriots day and stronger really very
similar but on Patriots it was a lot
more like graphic and showing like
actually the bombing like over and over
and any time anything she was about the
bombing ideally start like bawling cuz
it's like it's so close to home and he's
like obviously like literally right down
there like right down there but yeah
that was that it was still really good
movie I would definitely recommend
seeing it and I really don't think I've
loved all that much today at all because
I just in question all day I had my
lunch later I divided dinner there and
we were just cranking away at work they
have a presentation tomorrow and then
I'm going home tomorrow night so I don't
make vlogs super super exciting to be
with my family and with Teddy would you
say like in the corner of this green
like
I'll be here the weekend after if we get
out of that in the weekend after that
but not the weekend after that because
then I'm going to rot yeah that was it
for today's vlog go hug everyone you
love and tell them that you love and
care about them and yeah cuz that's just
a mood I'm in right now I just wish I'm
Teddy just cuddle with me okay
