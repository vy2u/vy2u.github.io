best time of the year I don't know if
they'll be snow hi guys happy fog my
stay for I'm just really studying all
day today for my quarterfinals which are
tomorrow and Thursday and Taylor is like
knocked right now we're just doing some
work out there let me show you I'm a
puppy I haven't like vlogs at all today
I need to tell them what I've been doing
studying I did start a good laundry got
a late start
oh yeah we did the laundry we made
dinner I mean we made named Megan but it
was a show but it was like literally
I've never like just like cheese pasta
in my life and now it's like all I want
in college it's so good
she's my closet and sprinkle parmesan so
that into my girl chicken so I was
dinner I was studying finance and oh we
should tell them what I did that was
really bad I had a breakdown today and I
was like sobbing because I basically
forgot to do the easiest thing in core
which is like you give a team feedback
to everyone in your team like the nine
and other members and then that's how
the professor's figure out your grade so
it's like really important because you
recommend if a certain members should
get like an upgraded downgrade or like
the normal grades that they give the DA
I got to tell you I did TLA also J
really yeah so it was due at noon but
you guys know I was gone in like LA all
weekend and I read 12:00 p.m. last night
when I got off my flight and I was like
oh it's due at midnight one day like I
have all day to do it and then at 2:00
p.m. I looked and I'm like why's the
forum like closed like it was on t LA
and I just like obviously 12 p.m. is
noon and I just like didn't realize and
I literally had a breakdown because
they've told us for like since the first
day of the semester literally that like
if you don't do the final
um team like TLA it's like the most
important one you get five points off
your final grade in every class so then
like all over it's like five points up
your final grade
so I was like freaking out and I was so
upset but so that I just did it on a
Word document and send it to my four
professors and like apologize and was
like I assume total responsibility for
this it was totally my fault
and I hope you can consider my feedback
even though it's like three hours late
and I only totally apologize I was
traveling so you can literally just it's
my fault I thought it was jamming night
not noon so cross your fingers that
maybe they'll consider it
I'll probably get some points off maybe
I'll get like one point instead of five
boy like two didn't have I don't know
crazy burgers I hope but yeah like I
still tried you know so anyway my um
lesson of the day is pay attention to
deadlines and I thought that I did mind
you like I had this forum open on my
computer since last Tuesday and it
opened last Friday but then Friday
whatever I was gone with again so
planner you know I do have a planner and
I didn't use it the semester which is so
job I've always used it in the past in
the semester I have like really pulitzer
planner and I just stopped bringing with
me because I stopped writing in it and
this is probably the most important
semester that I should have used planner
I like it's the most important semester
at BU so just really I'm done fell apart
without my planner I know I used to and
then now I think that I'm like Superman
like don't need it and like I do need it
see I use a planner page I do deadlines
but whatever we're gonna go open blog
this day for and it's gonna be great and
my camera is dying so this is how today
is going everyone so everyone Meghan is
currently sitting on the couch that I
unpacked on yesterday it's covered in my
things on any bus remained ever gay
XO did a teen day for gay seems exciting
I need some excitement today since I did
a whole lot of crying when you're just
like so frustrated and like angry at
yourself and like there's no one to be
angry at except for myself
and your stuff deserves no one here is
obviously thanks for my dad
oh my gosh these are so fine I love
these I think these are actually like I
might be making this up but I feel like
these have a matching top because I know
Tasha has this top and it's like kind of
long-sleeved and flowy and like ties in
the middle and it's like cropped so it
would totally go with these pants these
are so cute they look like they fit me
perfect t-minus like 18 hours until our
finance final tell me what happened
today
oh I told them really what the
professor's replied really nicely but I
explained that I was like away no I will
be good for you too hopefully it's okay
cross your fingers guys Dave my dad
texted me it goes at 5:00 p.m. tomorrow
I'm gonna say a prayer for you you see
my comment on your dad's comment no I
need you yeah he goes he goes Wow great
presentation guys I surely would buy one
and I go a compact only eighty four
ninety-nine okay guys did you know we
took a portfolio you do I first okay
everything like two different things
like you're like Google and Microsoft
lesson of the day
lesson of the day you know like
Microsoft and Pepsi right and you have
2,000 shares of Microsoft at $25 for
Sheraton you have 3000 shares of Pepsi
at $36 a share and then if the stock
prices change you just gotta multiply
that by your number of shares so pause
here everyone write that down
yeah for those of you who are following
along back home and you can't repeat how
many shares 2,000 shares of Microsoft
3000 shares of Pepsi they're not doing
good at teaching that my goose goes to
$33 and penisy goes down to 32 so then
you multiply those by better
I'm 33 I think isn't that sounds right
and then 3,000 times 30 G's that she can
do math in her head okay two plus two
equals four minus one that's three quick
bones when she gets nervous and doing
math she starts playing with a hammer
so you a ninety six thousand to you at
66,000 you get a hundred sixty two
thousand and if you will refer to on the
PowerPoint I am looking at right now
then you get stop it you guys haven't
gotten if you haven't gotten it here
please don't continue the video pause
here to figure it out again we're trying
to figure out the weight of the
portfolio this is a video the video will
resume in three two one
so moving on you can see that the
portfolio weights change change then if
you add them together you equals one
hundred percent yeah and that's how you
know if you got it right
teaching with Gretchen Oh in this I
actually knew okay so suppose you and
suppose twenty thousand City hold on
question two for those of you falling
back home this is number two and then
eighty thousand GE title of this video
how I can teach you how to get a degree
in finance and then eighteen percent
return for that forty percent for those
of you following on home this is the
problem we're not giving them to answer
to this one okay comment below with
these but yeah if you guys get this
right I'm really excited for you because
I did it in my head actually I was so
proud I got it right that just shows how
smart she is
so in closer
today's gonna be teaching with Sacha and
Gretchen a lot of you guys want to know
how we give such great presentations not
me but you if you like the secrets you
will sign up to my six week course three
easy payments of 99
you know I just look for it it's okay no
one but no him or I will disown you as a
subscriber
venmo me and I'll tell you where
Gretchen lives and Oh actually I was
reading for this did you know you can do
theirs okay there's three ways for like
returns or something there's average
return geometric return and realized
return and then realize return is when
there's dividends and then average and
geometric is when there's no dividends
right okay lesson number two today pause
if you know this is it a standard
deviation standard deviation variance
which is good oh my gosh it is 157
I'm so tired I've literally just been
reading through PowerPoint yeah I'm
writing a rap he's gonna write a rap
about me it's gonna be a love song all
of juice and I'm in underneath all the
powerpoints or lectures ever
that's like approach about say I mean
everyone knows that but I would say like
I feel like sometimes in the beginning
of college it do you know that like the
lectures were available online you know
but definitely like rewatch them if they
recorded or like go through the
PowerPoint because like obviously that's
why you're gonna be tested on if it is
in the lecture they say this off for a
while yeah we can do the rap at the
beginning of tomorrow cliffhanger
