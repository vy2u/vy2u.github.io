home
you can't tell in my room right now I
was trying to live in I got up around
9:00 I live in Tibet at 9 p.m. last
night insults on my name like I saw
every 12 hours - they're so tired from
traveling from Paris and it's nice and
smelly yeah look uh because there's like
pretty cold in Paris but it doesn't
really snow there I don't think it's
just really closing this now and right
now me my mom headed to the gym was he
still some news and she was super tired
and oh actually at 1:00 p.m. me and
Caroline are going to get our nails are
gonna get mani-pedis and I'm so excited
because I haven't seen Caroline since I
saw her in London and what's so crazy is
like before that we didn't see each
other for like a whole year and we're
like why haven't we seen each other in
so long like this is horrible we miss
each other so yeah it's gonna be really
good to see her and then we're gonna go
to Christmas
Evie which is so insane to me like you
know the day before Christmas Eve I
remember growing up we'd always have
like Christmas Eve parties with my
friends and whatever it's just so it's
so like nostalgic being home you guys
get me if you like I live away from home
and come home for the holidays
oh wait before I forget I think the very
first got like the getting my blog so
long and I don't want to do that I don't
like doing I could put boring to watch
but just gotta keep you guys updated
yesterday you guys know my luggage was
lost when we went from Paris to JFK like
never got on the flight from Paris to
JFK so today it went from Paris to
Boston to JFK and now it's on his way
from JFK to Detroit and then Detroit to
Albany where I live it's a good very
roundabout way I don't know why I think
those are just like the quickest slides
because I was crying to the woman I
didn't even beat you but like tears on
my face I was like I don't even care
about the stuff in there
I'm just sad that Lucy's Christmas
presents are there like if she doesn't
get those presents I got her like she
wanted to go for Christmas I'm gonna be
so sad
hopefully that comes it's opposed to
getting that like 10:30 p.m. tonight so
I cross your fingers that it gets here
I'm scared cuz like snowy they like it
might get delayed whatever I just I'm
praying cross my fingers
oh also Sasha met Jeezy the other day I
think he has like mutual friends with
them which is really cool and it was
like chatting with him and he sent me
videos of meeting him inside so I'll
insert them right here today
Marielle and I are on our way to bgz you
show yourself well you can say some
stuff yeah she's like Jesus biggest fan
so mommy just went to the gym okay she
doesn't want to be filmed I think you
look they always though the waiting is
so good right now
I think cuz it's so like right out from
the snow I remember being a little
kidding going out at recess and putting
on sunglasses no snowy and everyone was
like what are you doing and make fun of
me and I was like no this snow is too
bright oh my god I said my ears need a
pop like does that ever happen you work
out I hate here maybe it's cuz my music
was so loud and this problem to my hair
is like really really clean I mean now I
just worked out but like I washed it
last night and it was just like really
really clean this morning my hair's
really clean it's really like slippery
and like light I don't know how to
describe it and like fluffy so that it
doesn't stay in a ponytail that well
like I'd rather work out with more like
dirty hair look like dry shampoo in it
because then it like stays in place my
hair was just like before I hang out all
the time because it's really like you
know I mean nice yeah mine's really
is better when it starts to get dirty
really
that's just so he's happens to be and
like when it's dirty it's kind of like
Gracie there's like product and iton
stuff so it looks kind of stays in place
but now I just get all these like fluffy
clean little hairs hurry that didn't we
played basketball together oh my gosh

match to the snow sole you'll be living
