we already have eight of those because
me Megan Taylor and pretty much Leigh
like all eat the same food and if
there's anything different it's cuz we
got it cuz she'll eat some different
something else but like or like if
there's ever like meat in there it's
usually leaves cuz we just like don't
eat it that much like a fish you eat
chicken sometimes like Taylor obviously
doesn't so I don't know we just all have
the same footing there like literally
I'm like if I one more carrot and hummus
I'm literally gonna lose it it's like oh
we eat like there's like sweet potatoes
and bananas and apples like that's all
we ever eat because we're just like
really healthy so it's really fun when
someone like brings back cookies or like
junk food or something and we just like
go ham cuz we like eat healthy all the
time

watching Sam cook chicken for us behind
the oven and it's still there we're
gonna get my you guys notice it or no
yeah that tofu for me with my fingers my
hands are like burning I was like squish
the chicken before Connecticut game if
she goes Gordon Ramsay over here taking
like one of those stabbing knives or are
they called
I don't know anything nice and I could
probably use anything but like it like
I've actually cut off my hand like why
did I choose to do that vlog is gonna be
cooking with a V a V invention for
chicken turned out so well k now you
can't help but make it be such a good
job one word nice ass I would I'm
literally scared to shop myself eating
check out on the blog I'm gonna go out
of spring don't it's really good Megan
knows what's up and I don't think it's
wrong I think it's really
first time cooking and it was kind of a
training wheels up chicken Caesar salad
which is like my favorite bit of all
time yeah Wendy Kim how is the one food
I missed I went to buy Chloe I may have
as you just how that's all begins but it
tastes just like Caesar salads and it
was like the best day of my life because
I was still being in but I kept like eat
it kind of and they make it out of like
cashews and stuff and it literally
tastes like me and having just decided
that you know our chicken suit ours
great although we made pasta but like we
should have sauce like I wasn't about to
put it in a pan because that's you know
cold so I put it in a teacup one two
three bill them all over the microwave
it it looks really good cuz he turned
out great
I put corn in it let me just tell you oh
we also made corn in my cream because we
are gonna it is also 8 p.m. so wait we
guys can you actually teach us like oh
maybe that's what you do wine is pasta
sauce explode when you put it in the
microwave
who would've thought it was in there
it's like five minutes is in there for
like literally a minute I check it out
every 10 seconds stick my finger in and
it was so cold so I don't know you know
what I'm just gonna be a good roommate
I'm gonna clean it up right now
so that no one else has to deal with it
because I'm a tailor my type of pasta
okay you would I can't tell the
difference see the one that's in the
container right there that's my type but
I'm scared she's gonna be mad even
though actually her this brown rice yeah
like I think so I think that means it's
boiling but except when it's really well
it's like you know it does that mean
boiling let us know but um Taylor's
pasta in that bag right there is brown
rice quinoa and mine is whole wheat so
like what if she doesn't like Kobe even
though they literally look exactly you
see
we're eating your whole wheat but I'm
gonna make our brown rice quinoa cuz I'm
scared she's not gonna like whole wheat
will she even noticed different no it'll
be probably not okay everyone look at me
I'm just a home what is it a housewife
