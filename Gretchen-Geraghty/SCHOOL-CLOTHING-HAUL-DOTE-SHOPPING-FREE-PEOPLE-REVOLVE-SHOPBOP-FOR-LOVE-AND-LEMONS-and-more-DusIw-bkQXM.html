time because a couple wants it all right
but yeah I love it up anyway so their
stories really cute they like the cutest
stuff and it's basically like her style
which I love and like it's like it's in
weird mine so the first thing I got
they're just these white skinny jeans
and yeah we're just we're looking gray
oh the brand is making her that one
looks getting like other brand and yeah
they're just some clean basically skinny
jeans gonna trick you it was me that
prepared waving me games but this
summertime and then this top I just
thought would go perfect with it oh my
gosh I didn't even know the back looks
like that so how cute is that so I got
this top from Lulu's and all this is
Monday August lady course but that
wasn't quite enough before it's just
like this white and blue stripe top I
love the cut of it I didn't even realize
when I ordered the back of ties I do so
many other bralette yeah oh my gosh so
cute
well basically love this and obviously
didn't go so cute with your white jeans
and then I also got this gray
from Urban Outfitters which I actually
had at the toe colors my favorite ever
that I loved it so I just got it right
because in this great color now I
thought it'd look really cute together
so this is like the comfy sweater ever
to look if you now suburban
you know what I'm talking about if you
don't get it I have it in green too
hey guys like me might like something
about it every killer we're like really
loved about me but I want to try to see
the typical back because that rug is
really cool not all of my full outfits
have come yet but I wore this yesterday
in an Instagram post really like so this
jumpsuit is from for loving lemons and
asked lemons on it also about one them
yeah so it looks like this and how the
tires are waste and then I think it's
cropped because it fits me pretty one
way and I'm really short so I'll be like
ankle length on here like yeah and yeah
with it I print this bag from the shop
off or doesn't get so cute me strawberry
I'm so on point right now yeah oh really
and yeah also the necklace I'm wearing
which I think it's been shot Bob yeah
and then I got these shoes from Dolce
Vita but I feel need they're from
shopbop mondo and they're so cute
they're like these little sandals and
they have a little bit of us with a
little going on and they're like the
white colors this match everything and I
know this will go with so so much it's
actually the mine Glasnevin I was
showing you guys I got like three pairs
of shoes for my five outfits because you
don't need any precious traffic come on
girl
so I got these gray ones that are super
cute me Tasha but obsessed with this
time I got think yeah yes you have the
same ones I'm actually wearing ones that
are really similar to them right now
but these are just from the Steve Madden
your great and they go really perfect
with those white jeans blue top gray
sweater you know like the whole vibe
these are be really good for the
exterior being to you're saying could
wash it out together your three
like little tiny likes and early heels
like this that are just really classic
would be like perfect for that so love
these obviously don't find out two bags
to go with all my different habits so I
got this one from three people and I
think this is so cute I've been needing
a new crossbody and I love ya it's so
cute
yeah this was 48 and like bags out like
this or like oh so that next outfit this
other bag it's literally yeah this one
is braids this one doesn't fit same kind
of style so I'm just like II love this
little crossbody style a big bag yes I
agree I love it
well it's also $40 so basically same
kind of deal and I thought it looked
really cute with this lavender romper -
I know I have your invoice
yeah she does but I just gotta click
away to live in there
so cute it's like ties run away so it
kinda looks like a wrap so it's on our
type to show the soft and comfy I guess
I want you spread these shades again
with it yeah
I got this dress I kind of copied
Gretchen because she has this in red and
okay online this look yellow but the
color is orange and I think it's
definitely like that yellowy orange by
it's this really cute dress it has this
little tie in the front and then a half
little cut out we're gonna Outfitters by
the way so for my next outfit going
ahead and backwards I'm going to show
you the shoes first because I am
obsessed for the shoot I've actually
been saving for a while these are from a
shop up as well but they're actually
from Steven by Steve Madden I think how
they had those like climbs by Steve
Madden you know the opinion and I just
like white leather refueler the bag just
has a little shiny detail which is cute
they kind of I mean look at dienes in
that way I've been wanting ask the
jewels were so long and I feel like
these are perfect because they're like
really basic little bit stickers like a
little platform detail and I don't have
any platform shoes severities so pretty
living yes they're like a big you know I
actually post a picture on Instagram in
them and everyone was like oh my gosh
the answer is shop she go with I just
got these jeans because I haven't had
these which everyone has them there's
like a classic there the Jaime high
waist
grazer Topshop team they're my favorite
cheese yeah Tosh's love them forever
it's obvious read about that I feel like
every months them so they're just like
the dark washed color and they go away
to your ankle I would ease yesterday
with those shoes and it looks pretty
bomb in my opinion and then this top to
go with I've also been ironing on three
people it's just like off the shoulder
your buttons uh I really like this style
of it I just think it's super cute and I
thought its kind of like a washed out
with the color little like burnt orange
actually going up actually it's kind of
red other those red orange salmon salmon
okay
okay I got something else from 311
Lebanese people obsessed it's actually
so so small it gets it's very tight like
I can zip it but like my boobs fly out
and I don't have to so like we're gonna
we're we're gonna do something to have
us like works out like I'm gonna get
next results an extra small very tight
that don't get too small and it works so
it made me out of small mouths but I
don't know it's really kind of like
shows you guys know it runs all because
Tosh is like the tiniest bit kids I feel
this cherry pretty dress you guys see I
like printed things apparently and yeah
I'll be believer to show but it kind of
just ties in the front here and this
part where I could get it tied close
enough together really not expose myself
but yeah really cute little dress if it
was a sign up you're probably looking to
cuter on me but I knew like this and I
actually probably wear the same sandals
and then I got this dress and I got this
dress from Luke in gray as well and I
actually feel like I wanted just that
look like this from Zara do you know
what yeah I know the exact dress girl
Jenna off-the-shoulder
so I found this one looking gray and I
was like yeah I just thought it was
really cute and I don't have one that's
like officially this oh this is funny
cuz I'm wearing I'm like I didn't ever
dress right now oh yeah this is little
baby needs a fever is like but yeah the
only other denim dress I own
right now but I don't feel me one so I
wanted one that off-the-shoulder because
the sort of thing yeah okay yeah yeah
connection to be a little cute
take the last two things that I have to
show you guys and from Reformation which
recently was introduced to me says I
haven't tried this on yet so see if it
fits this stuff I bought running small
to order like I said I just went outside
but I got this really cute dress I think
about his slippers he has it so that's
how I saw it like this red dress I know
I have this little cutout right and then
I kind of like your apps and then it's
like this I got this little bitch inside
but there's nothing small like short to
begin with so I need like two short I'd
go with those white sheet as well and
then I think my favorite thing that I
got is this two piece set from
Reformation as well at the top looks
like this it's a little crop top and a
lace up with a detail come into these
pants that are like high-rise and I
think they're supposed to be cropped but
like I said I'm really short so they go
like full-length but they're just these
striped trousers or pants and I think
this is so cute together
I ordered a black espadrilles to go with
this so as you can help in this trial
video I tried to try on like the outfits
completely together after I showed them
all so you could see what they look like
together so let me know what you think
about that in the comments but I also
got this outfit that I forgot to show in
the video I got this tank top from Free
People the jeans were the same ones from
Topshop and then that bag is the same
three people one and my necklace is from
revolve and then the boots I got from
forever 21 I love them they're just so
cute they're just basic black booties
that go with everything and then I
actually got these one cheese spoon
jeans to go with the outfit but then
they didn't end up fitting me but
they're like so cute like boyfriend
jeans with rips I love how it has like
the rip in the back I think that's so
cute
