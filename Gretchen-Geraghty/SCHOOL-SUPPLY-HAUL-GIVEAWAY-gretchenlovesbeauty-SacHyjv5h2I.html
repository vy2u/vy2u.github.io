super exciting video and it's actually
my back to school supply haul oddly
enough I've never actually done one of
these videos before I've been on YouTube
for like three years now and I've never
done a back to school supply haul video
and I actually never used to understand
like the big hype about them and I was
like why does everyone even do them like
they're just pens and pencils and
notebooks but the other day I was
watching some of them and actually
they're really fun to watch just to see
all the different notebooks and like
folders everyone gets and like honestly
it's so exciting like when I was getting
notebooks and folders I was like oh my
gosh this is awesome and like I just
can't wait to write on them and you know
when you open up like a nice new
notebook and you have with your new pen
and you're just like like I don't know
it's the best feeling ever did announce
me like that is it just me stay tuned to
the very end of this video for all the
details about the giveaway and for those
of you that don't know I'm actually
going to be a freshman at Boston
University in the fall but I still got a
bunch of school supplies for my classes
just like you and in high school and
most of the stuff I got is from Staples
and some stuff it's from Walmart to
everything I got you can pretty much
find at both of those places except the
first thing I'm showing you which is my
Lilly Pulitzer planner and for those of
you that watch my videos you know I'm
obsessed with elephants so this is like
the most exciting thing ever and for my
senior year of high school I actually
had the green and pink one I think that
was like this past year's edition of
this planner so I just got the 2015-2016
one and it's just navy blue with like
these gold elephants and this just makes
me seriously so excited like you have no
idea I really like the way my other one
worked for this past year so I knew I
would like this one too and the next
thing I'll show you is actually another
planner that I got but this one's from
Staples I decided that I would get two
one for school and one for YouTube so
like I said just one will be for school
and one for YouTube it'll just be easier
to have them separate a lot of the stuff
I got is actually like writing utensils
so I got a bunch of pencils I just got
these like yellow Ticonderoga ones I
feel like these are the best
non-mechanical ones because mechanical
ones are my favorite but you know you
just sharpen these ones they're like
number two basic pencils these ones like
are actually my favorite mechanical
pencils they're the big extra Sparkle
ones they're just like pretty colors and
I like the way they write
I've always use these ones I got these
mechanical pencils too these ones I
think look more like normal pencils but
they're like mechanical pencils they're
like the yellow pencil II colored ones
and it came with a pen too so that's
cool and then I got these markers I mean
think he's so excited so I can stay
super organized and like color code my
different classes and YouTube and what's
not and I realize these because they
make like thin marker lines because they
have like a felt tip so love these and
then I just got some exfil markers
because if you saw at my dorm hall video
I got a white board for my dorm room so
it's good that I got a bunch of colors
because then I can color code my
whiteboard calendar too and for headers
I just got these sharpie ones they're
just a bunch of different colors and I
like these too because they're thinner
so it'll be easier to like hold in my
hand and they're not like the really
basic ones
I think I like the thinner ones better
and then I just got these pens these are
my favorite pens they're the big round
stick grip extra comfort and I just got
blue ones in black ones and I'm actually
realizing now I got 24 blue ones but
twelve black ones oops I always use
these pens and I just like them because
they have like a grip on your hand so
your pen doesn't go flying out of your
hand because believe it or not that has
actually happened to me so many times
and my teachers have always been like a
stickler for like not using colored ink
I'm pretty sure in college they'll
probably be like that too so I just got
the blue ones and black ones no purple
or pink for me I wish I wish we could
write like light blue aqua ink or
something oh my gosh can you see my
stomach in this video I don't think you
could oops I just got a bunch of folders
and notebooks and I got them to all
match each other and I've always kind of
color-coded my subjects too and if you
take four classes each semester and each
class has four credits so you take like
16 credits each semester anyways so the
four classes I'm taking our biology
chemistry like a writing class that all
freshmen have to take and then Spanish
for all of these I just got with the
five star one subject notebooks and
folders and I don't get the paper
folders I get the plastic ones so they
don't rip I find these ones hold up a
lot better for Spanish I've always just
used light blue so I just got a light
blue notebook and a light blue folder
also I just got one subject for all of
them because I'm the kind of person
where I don't like carrying like really
big notebooks like I don't like the
three subject or the five subject ones
just because they're really heavy and
for me like if I fill this whole thing
up I'd rather just go buy another
notebook
and start with a new notebook that have
like a really heavy one you know I'm
saying then for chemistry because it's
seriously the worst class ever I just
know I'm gonna die I got the color of
death but no seriously chemistry is
awful
so I had to get black so I just got the
black notebook in the black folder I
know these plain colors aren't like the
cutest things over but they just help
keep me organized so we're biology I've
always used green kind of like
self-explanatory treatise I guess grass
but I just got the same folder and the
same notebook in green and then for my
writing class like I said all freshmen
have to take I just got white and I
really like the way white looks I don't
know I think it's white notebook looks
really sleek wait no both white folder
and then I saw this pretty purple folder
and I just think this is so pretty
this isn't designated to like a specific
class but I'll probably use this as like
a homework folder or like a take-home
folder I don't know if you guys have
those in your schools I've always done
that so this will probably be like my
everything folder and I think it's so
cute have you guys noticed my videos
recently maybe just right now I had this
thing where I like drop my ellos
recently I don't know why I've been
having trouble with him I've never had
trouble with my Ella's like all growing
up until recently like it's really hard
for me to say older and folder folder
folder
I don't know ah my friends my family
will like laugh at me all the time but I
don't know why I can't say it folder
folder oh my Boulder Boulder and I just
got two things that will sleeve paper
and if you're anything like me you
ripped through a loose leaf like it's
nobody's business I think I always run
out of this stuff so I just got 150 plus
150 is 300 brushing up on those math
skills and of course I got the college
rolled ones because I'm in college you
know I feel like even in high school - I
would use the college ones cuz they're
like thinner space than the wide ones I
mean if you're not in first grade I'm
pretty sure you use the college ruled
once and I just got some note cards
because I feel like these are always
handy dandy and I will probably end up
needing them to study for my classes I'm
so nervous for college like classes have
to be so much harder than high school
and I've just heard terrible terrible
things about chemistry so these will
probably help me memorize like elements
and whatever then I just saw these
scissors and I figured I would probably
need some scissors and these would say
ages five plus so don't worry we made
the age limit so I guess I got pink ones
and purple ones I'll probably just give
a pair to Lucy Lucy's coming to be with
me too if you guys didn't know even
though I've said a million times we're
not rooming together but we're on the
same floor in the same building so
pretty sure it'll be okay then I just
got this ruler and it's bendy because
I'm actually five years old but no it's
royal blue so of course it makes me
happy
I love royal blue and I'll probably need
this to like meet graphs and whatever
you use rulers for maybe measuring
things I don't know then I got some tape
because I figured I would probably need
some tape if I rip any papers I have
tape and if you guys didn't notice I
actually got my hair done yesterday so
look no more roots but whoo I'm so happy
so blonde and also do you probably can't
tell but I did get it cut I only got a
tiny bit trimmed at the end like
literally a tiny bit because I want my
hair to be long again because gvt when I
chopped it off there in inches in my
hair do you guys remember that because I
sure do and it has been growing out
since then so now it's like this nice
boob length okay this is getting
off-topic moving on the last couple
things I got are actually all really fun
and colorful I got some of these like
colorful flippy things that I can use to
organize papers or I can put it in my
planner to like put what day I'm out you
know and I got this little container
from Staples which is so nice it has a
bunch of those like mini Clippy things
it has some rubber bands it has some
weight what are these called Oh paper
clips and also have some tack and the
last thing I got are just these magnets

all these things look there's some polka
dotted ones and some striped ones so now
