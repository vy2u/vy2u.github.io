the train this guy came to Tosh I need
real a picture of her on the train how
cute
oh yeah but I felt weird well you know
there because it's really quiet
but we are at Madeline trains
we are going to Fiji because how she
needs her Gucci belt and hopefully this
one has four sides because yesterday
they didn't got the one that we went
today the cabinet and
she would enjoy its presence in her life
Pauline it's like people I had no belts
- that's why I was like might as well
get a good one because then you can just
nobody was good at that
yeah my bothers link was from brandy the
other day and it straight up is like a
very tight choker on me because I have
like a thick neck you feel look at how
pretty the area is that we're in so
pretty it's area down there there's like
a big building and like you're statute
and stuff we'll go down there after this
we can show you but right now we're at
like the biggest fuchi ever so we're
gonna go to this Gucci and hopefully
katashi's belt probably gonna get yelled
at for something but these were out the
belts look at this bag rotating guys
look at it she's checking for Tasha's
belt right now just cuz she's sore so
cute okay we're sad because Tasha
checked online just to make sure that
there was the size 70 thin black Gucci
belt with the gold and then I didn't
even have it and she was like the
closest one in your size is in Italy and
it's a 75 not even a 70
which is so annoying but I should have
known he's like that's the island when I
went to the one in Boston I just got so
lucky that I got mine cuz she's like
from like Stephanie to like 85 is just
always sold out because everyone always
gets that I know they're just like
always so about maybe they make maybe
it's a thing where it's like and they
like make them always all that no Joe um
they always make them sold out so that
you like feel like you need it or you
know what I mean
but you like want it more since there's
like less available but anyway we're
trying to find food right now this is
like not cute lighting I look like a
pale a pale rodent look how pretty I
should we will get closer but like what
did we stumble across over here don't
yell at me I should probably know and
then that ferris wheel like we just
ended up over here somehow but yeah so
that's really pretty
and
we're going this way to go to Angelina's
Angela men for that one of you commented

suggestion because we're going to take
about chocolate because that's usually I

gained 50 pounds but like I'm just
living my best life chocolate croissants
are they so good oh and I just bought us
25 euros truffle chocolate truffles
spending my money wise over here and in
breakin more comfortable vlogging here

chocolate couldn't you just see the gold
Cartier bracelet right on my wrist right

because we speak no French and I think
we're okay yeah and beginning we were
worried because we have one waiter that
didn't speak that much English but like

would say that 90% of France speaks
English like so we're just let me like
everyone in Europe or in English yeah
