we're gonna go to Paradise Falls and I'm
so excited because me and Tasha have
been dreaming about Paradise Falls like
since yesterday my favorite place ever
sorry I look I'm so excited battery no
yeah Paradise Falls is my favorite if
you go there get chocolate hide it is
amazing I would get it like every week
when I was at school I'm so excited
okay that's definitely what I'm getting
you guys know we love making the
chocolate ones
look how pretty it is we were saying
like just look and Tasha told me I
didn't realize but it's so right that
it's like cloudy in the mornings and
then I get sunny in the afternoon that's
like very true because yesterday was
cloudy the mornings on toes just can
make a cloudy cool day and by the
afternoon I was like dripping in sweat
it was so quad then we have our little
shoot with stylehaul which we don't
really know what to expect it's kind of
unclear if it's like a video or like
pictures were like who's even involved
so we don't really know but we're just
gonna hope to have fun and kind of wing
it I'm wearing you shorts I got
yesterday whoo

how pretty it is out here we're on the
Manhattan Beach Pier and me too oh my

Hall this this is cool now I just walk
around LMU it's making me deeply
consider being in the cold and snowy
Northeast I know right for like this
summer and like probably with like no

figured Now or Never off the bat yeah

of campus seeing palm trees every day

would just wake up and like instantly be
happy I'm like a look at the view
like what I like that it's actually
campus like IPU you guys know bu it's
not a campus it's a street no there's
smog in LA yeah I thought that was like
Mexico City our cell library is really
cool too
this is gonna good to show my parents
too so when I say what did you do when
you're in LA I'll be like mom and dad
watch my vlogs I'll call the palm trees
right there I'm just obsessed with palm
trees I think I have a weird obsession
with them because they're like not where
