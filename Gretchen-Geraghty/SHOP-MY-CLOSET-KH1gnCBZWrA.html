video that I'm so excited to film for
you guys and I've said this before that
I've said this before but I say that I'm
excited to film every video that I film
but actually I'm so excited to film this
and by the way you guys didn't know like
YouTube makes me so happy and I'm in a
really good mood when I film so of
course it makes me excited
but anyways I've just been meaning to
film it and finally here we are today as
you can tell for the title of this video
it is just going to be a video where I'm
telling you how you can get my clothes
and they're my clothes that I've either
grown out of our clothes that I just
don't wear anymore and the way I'm
selling all of my clothes and I
mentioned this on Twitter and Instagram
I've never actually mentioned it like
officially on YouTube so hopefully for
some of you that don't follow me on the
consumer Twitter which you should like
links in the downbar as usual so the app
that I am at selling my clothes on is
called posh Mart and I don't even know
if I mentioned it but the link to
download Poshmark and just shop my
closet will be a link down below and
yeah thanks again so much posh market
for sponsoring this video and I know
that so many different people use
Poshmark to like sell their old clothes
so I've known for a while that I wanted
to use Poshmark just because it's like
the most simple app in my eyes I think
and his videos really exciting too
because they actually reached out to me
and I was like um let me think about it
yes like oh my gosh because I'd already
been planning on making this video to
tell you guys about the clothes that I'm
selling with Poshmark and then they
reached out to me and we were like do
want to work together on a video so I
was like yeah like I already have over a
hundred things listed on my Poshmark for
people to buy so yeah on my Poshmark my
user name is Gretchen with five ends and
like I said I have over a hundred things
probably over 200 items of clothes like
they're literally all under my bed right
now and it just takes me so long to
actually post them on my Poshmark
I all really plates already
basically if you don't know Poshmark is
just a free app it's like a marketplace
for women's like beauty and fashion and
the reason it's so convenient is because
it allows you to just buy and sell it
straight from your phone and you can't
tell how I feel about the app already I
love it I just think it's such a good
idea for some people to get rid of some
clothes that they don't fit anymore that
they don't really wear as much and then
other girls it might be like their dream
shirt you know and then you can get it
for like way cheaper like I know I've
gotten I have this one vest and I
remember I wanted to show that from
forever 21 and then they sold out didn't
happen anymore and I thought on Poshmark
so I just think it's such a good idea
and such a great place that you can get
clothes that you
want that you couldn't get other places
and if you use my code and as gfu you
will actually get $5 off of your first
order and if you don't know Poshmark
works if you're interested in like
selling on their basically what they do
is you get 80% they take 20% because
they do like all the shipping labels and
everything which i think is like so
convenient because like in my experience
on there it's so great like when someone
buys like a shirt or something of mine
they email me a shipping label and then
I print it and ship it out right away so
it's so nice and it just uses like a
standard shipping label for like five
pounds for each package so it's just way
easier that way see if you don't have
Poshmark already definitely download it
using my $5 code and as she a few at
registration so you can I have a free
five dollar system on there and bonus
shipping is only 99 cents on your first
purchase on the day you sign up
so enough about the app I just picked up
some clothes like randomly that I'm done
on there so you can have an idea like
the type of stuff I'm selling you didn't
also you can just check out my Poshmark
like I said before it's scratching with
side ends and one of the things I'm
selling is it dress this dress from
Urban Outfitters which I love but it's
just too tight on me anymore and I'm so
obsessed with it and it's so cute and
links and literally I would still wear
it but to go and then they sure I've
just worn so much I'm like I can't wear
it anymore and it says navy blue at
least tank top from Abercrombie and
Fitch and these are just some a denim
high-waisted ripped shorts from forever
21
again I love these too tight what
happens if you grow up kids it's a
little Chiyo parola from brandy melville
I have so much braiding all in there
like literally so much and that means a
little Mexican friend choice from brandy
melville and I seriously have so many
different brands I have some athletic
stuff some lemon some brandy melville
some Abercrombie through urban like
literally a bunch of everything so
definitely go check out my Poshmark
and yeah thank you guys so much for
watching this video and I'll see you my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
