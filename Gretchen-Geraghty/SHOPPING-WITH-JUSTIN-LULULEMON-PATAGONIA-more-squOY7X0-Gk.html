started trying to vlog today but um
Justin was being grumpy because I kept
filming him yeah how he got me these
ones from yesterday they're like Sandoz
I really like them I think I'm gonna
keep them in for a while Lucy do you
notice I think my skin's gotten better
it hasn't been this good in like a
really really long time and I don't know
why I think I've just been like careful
with it I've been eating healthier too I
think that's like a part of it and um I
don't know I've been poisoning it a lot
and I also think too of being Clemson
just like having the Sun on my skin
always helps it yeah so plan for the day
I think we're just gonna go to Newberry

think we're just gonna go
like lemon and such and then I think

yesterday and I want to loose he'd come
with us but she is too much homework I'm
like really tired we slept till 11:00
but we stayed up to like the one we were
talking to Makai of so late and
listening to all this different music
and Makai and Justin know that country
music and they kept playing it my ears
were bleeding yeah that's the face I
made to hate country music - right I
literally hate it he looked like a
floating head Barry didn't like kids
yeah they love it and they're playing
like house party and just all these
country songs and I was like oh look I
really try to like it I just hate it I'm
sorry for all you country fans who's
with me that look I like the lyrics are
good like I try to enjoy it but I just I
can't like I think it's like ingrained
in me because I literally try to listen

meanings and stuff but just like how the
songs sound in my head just like give me
a headache

I feel like my voice sounds like it's
getting scratchy like you know when it's
late my voice gets all scratchy but
anyways I haven't vlogged in a while I
think the last time we've logged was
when I say goodbye to Justin literally
right as I said goodbye I was like bye
when he was like getting on the train I
like walked up the stairs I started
crying I always cry ranee leaves I'm
such a baby but anyway um yeah now it's

really do keep you on like you know your
parents always like like wear your hats

sir very underrated but now that we
lizards makes big yeah I'm gonna go wash
my teeth and I'm gonna hand off the blog

it and I'm not gonna eat the Lindt
chocolates because she likes those mmm
it's almost 10 o'clock
past my bedtime oh boy alright well I
don't know if we'll see even
successfully ended off his walk
wait can I tell them when I want what I
was saying I wanted to say earlier okay
guys I know we've been trying to end
this walk for a while now and I'm sorry
it's just like the song segments at the
end but I just have to tell you my
thoughts really quick before I forget
about them I was thinking a lot
yesterday and today about relationships
just in general and it occurred to me
that I just feel like people in general
and I guess not all people but a lot of
people probably don't remember to tell
people that they really like and people
are really cool in their lives like how
much they mean to them and they love
them and stuff and I just think that's
important and that people would be a lot
happier if you just remember to tell
people that you love that you
love them and yeah it would I don't know
I was just thinking that so if you love
someone don't forget to tell that
because even if you think they know I'm
sure they would love to be reminded
sometimes just an idea anyway is so I
got really deep really quick but I don't
know I just been thinking a lot about
things and having lots of thoughts in
the past couple days so yeah thanks
watching today's vlog and I'll see you
in my next video bye everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
