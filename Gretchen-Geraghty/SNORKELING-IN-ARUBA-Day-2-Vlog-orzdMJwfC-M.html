cute okay it's getting foggy so I just
had to run back upstairs to grab my
headband but basically today we're just
adventuring around the island for those
of you that know about Aruba
half of it is like not inhabited so
we're like venturing around the island
because there's like some really cool
parts and it's like rocky we're going to
like the Natural Bridge and we got a
jeep for the day and I'm so excited
because I seriously love jeeps and it's
a white Jeep and it's like my dream car
or maybe a black one
they're so cute that's hard to film
outside because it gets really humid
like it fogs up the camera really quick
so I have to be careful about that
