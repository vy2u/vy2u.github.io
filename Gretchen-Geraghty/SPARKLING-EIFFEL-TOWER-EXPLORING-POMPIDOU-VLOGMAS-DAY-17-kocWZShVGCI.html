so both fears have not gone out of my
block campus I'm holding you find it but
it's horribly so there's like a
breakfast place like right downstairs
from where we live it's called Big Love
it looks so good so you're so excited to
go there and look at their building it
is like a long wait and probably like 10
15 minutes remember like it's like 11:30
and they're like okay like we'll call
you at 2:00 p.m. and they're like what
so you're like no and I walk to a
different place and they're like the
weights like 40 minutes yeah like what
we just call the new birthday I comb and
I think we're gonna end up going I don't

like you scars store see ya
I didn't really blog in there now we're
going to museum

just stopped in to flu

and Tasha got a scarf that she's been
wanting here's my mom for Christmas

while I was here and then we see a hat
because your head chilly clearly my mom
and Lucy need food cuz they would eat
all day and it's like three something so
hi Daddy

everyone know he says that they don't
hear you speak French and they want to
know if you do what
guys crepes here are amazing it's
spreading my hand off right now
but it's so good you have to get them
like literally anywhere you get them are
so good right there
there's that cooker over there
oh that's so cool
I think the little Ferris wheel you can
see to her he fell
what's a Latorre found mean lose hate to

don't want to show them this one I'm
confused

I'm just like a person and it's weird
that there's only color right there yeah
and there's like the other secret
there's like cross-hatching everywhere
but who is this person
comment down below cuz I have no idea is
that one two naked people and why are
their necks like really long these are
so pretty
Lucy defacing this one before it looks
like familiar don'ts pretty we like
talked about this in my marketing class
we saw that this painting looked safe
and then if it represented an airline we
would take it I remember it so clearly
that's so interesting
Lulu they showed us like this and then
they showed us like crazy funds really a
bunch of different color ones and
they're like which one would you which
company would you work for and everyone
said the colorful one because I thought
it would be fun and some people don't
want it like a safe job pick this one me
like what airline would you go on and
like 90% of people said this one because
like straight lines seemed like safe and
that cool it's not actually like moving
oh the lines are reflecting and this is
trippy oh this is parallel
look at the Eiffel Tower Sparkle and it
was like that app that you can buy that
makes things Sparkle I wish I bought it
that is so cool
that is unreal

is what they are telling us at dinner

remember when it was in Paris I think it
was last year they when they were
shooting the Paris like commercial video
for the Victoria Secret Fashion Show
they paid the government of Paris a
million dollars to keep it sparkling for
12 hours straight so they could get good
pictures and videos his men seyn I mean
it was so worth it for them it was
obviously no it's not that because I
just checked in it's 6:05

every hour that's so cool so guys we are
