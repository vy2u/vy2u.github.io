gym why I'm all sweaty Taylor's very
late for an important date as normal I
wanted to show you guys so I attempted
making overnight oh it's last night my
Robert Lucy and I did it once before but
Lucy didn't like it she was like why
would I like cold mushy oatmeal but I
like it I think it's good and then you
can just like grab it and go in the
morning I think it's like smart so I
literally used like an old peanut butter
jar container because I was like why not
and then I just hold a recipe I found
online it was like half cup almond milk
half cup oats maybe I could tablespoon
of chia seeds 2 tablespoons of peanut
butter and like a tablespoon of maple
syrup and I was it would that'll be good
to make it sweet but what happened was I
was holding the tablespoon and the maple
syrup and I poured it and it came out so
quick into so much one in here so I just
started eating it and it literally is
way too sweet like I can't even eat it
so I just made literally plain oatmeal
in a little ball I'm gonna attempt to
stir them together and hopefully it's
not weird but this is like too sweet
like can you see at the bottom I think
that's all peanut butter maple syrup
like a lava syrup so that's what I'm
doing
oh and I mean here with banana too
because I always eat oatmeal with banana
this morning is just very busy it needs
to be efficient good morning because I'm
presenting this morning for a QM
workshop in core and that is that 12:15
so I gotta get my butt to the business
school by like 11:30 so I can run
through it with my team and to be honest
I haven't really practiced yet I don't
know what I'm going to say look I know
the material so I can just like talk
about it and explain it from my own head
you know what I'm saying
but I should probably like run through
that really quick got a shower get ready
at home look nice representing even
though they're like pretty informal
until our last like formal presentation
because we just have like the
presentation workshop it's a bunch with
the different sections of core it's like
I don't talked about this before but
it's finance operations and
in QM and I wanted to post a video last
night I said like 2:30 editing it I just
could keep my eyes open like it wasn't
gonna happen but I knew that I had to
get it up this morning then because I
wanted to post yesterday it didn't
happen but I was just up so late and so
tired and had to work out and go through
my presentation and eat my overnight
oats and run and stuff so I got a bit
like 7 so I slept for like 4 and 1/2
hours so I'm so tired you know I was
just talking to Taylor like guys I don't
know how I did it freshman year I
literally didn't miss a day of vlog
mastering vlogmas uploaded every day we
had lifts like so many mornings at 6
a.m. we didn't practice for like 3 and
1/2 hours every afternoon Saturday
morning for like 4 hours like how was i
living like I actually wasn't in like I
was about major like I had my Kevin
Biolabs
so much they were three hours each you
so much chem class so much bio class and
not to mention my other ones and like I
just don't know how I was living like I
ended up being sick a lot and you're
breaking a rib and whatever but I like
did it somehow I just don't know how
like that was so much I guess like for
me being busy is good but I need to find
a balance and like make sure I'm getting
sleep because I feel like in the past
year I've just realized so much like how
important sleep is and the number I
don't sleep I just get a sake and feel
awful and have like bad days so it's
better to just sleep more so today I'm
gonna sleep a lot and I'm about to fix
my oatmeal off to class outfit of the
day fitness
Oh
so I just got back from shopping I
stopped into brandy melville super quick
I was actually looking for their cropped
jean jacket in red but I found it in
like black denim and I don't have any
black denim jean jacket so I thought
that was super cute and it was good to
have a little shopping break after
course and said so stressful then I
stopped into forever 21 and found this
crazy sequined silver sparkly skirt and
I was like hey that would be perfect for
my angel costume for Halloween this year
but I don't find any other like white
shorts that's what I initially wanted
wear so yeah that was fun and then now
I'm back I think I just want to make
broccoli for dinner I'm just in the mood
for broccoli and I think I bought
broccoli another day so yeah just made
dinner and I feel like it looks really
weird but I swear it's really good I
just cut up sweet potato tofu I actually
made it in a pan but the sweet potato
the broccoli and the kale I all just put
on a baking sheet in the oven with some
olive oil and salt and pepper
it makes sho good and you let it cook
for like a while some the kale gets
really crispy it's kind of like kale
chips like literally they sound like
that like really bright and crispy but
that's how it's good and then yeah I
just put with some teriyaki sauce on the
stove it's still good any combination of
this is my go-to because it just really
hit me now I'm just gonna juice
Marc this was a presentation I presented
today made that cool little pie chart
ever in my group was very impressive I
made this and no one thought it was me
but it was me so I just went to go hang
out with that being Lisa and I literally
brought my camera and then didn't even
blog cuz I didn't think about it I was
hanging out with my friends and chillin
and you know talking talking talking
because that's what we girls do but yeah
sorry today's vlog was like really
boring it was just a chill all day and I
think I spend like a lot of time alone
during the week which sounds sad but
it's just like how it is when you have
class a lot and whatever um so it's not
like it's exciting to vlog yeah it's
totally like okay and just I'm like
learning how to be cool with being alone
because being so extremely extroverted I
like hate being alone like I literally
like me being alone equals sad I don't
know if you guys are like Apple like
I don't know I think it's just something
that I like struggle with because you
need to be okay like on your own but I'm
like 9 even plan on talking on this
right now but that just gonna came up so
yeah I'm trying to be okay with being
one but that's something that I like
really hate like I just remember like
the first week or two of class like I
would get back maybe like 4:30 5:00 and
then everyone else my suite that's on
the room team get back like 6:30 so I
haven't maybe like an hour and a half to
myself every day and I'd come back and I
would see nothing I take here and I
would just like be sad and uncomfortable
because no one was around I mean like I
could never live my own oh my gosh never
if I should be able to but like I just
are you guys like that I don't know like
for me being alone equals sad but then
for other people it's completely
opposite like who sees the opposite of
me like she loves her a long time she
loves being alone she needs to be alone
it's like recharge and whatever so I
don't know it's really interesting to me
you were like yeah I'm about to go into
Taylor's room and bother her I'm lonely
and I want to talk to her you know
whatever anyway thank you guys so much
watching tease watch I'll see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
