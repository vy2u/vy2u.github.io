videos hey everyone so today I am
filming such an exciting video for you
guys I think it's just natural to have
this much energy at 11:36 p.m. I thought
we should have a nice little chat I'm
even wearing my PJs bottoms already I
cannot wait for spring break
the promise of sunshine is really just
getting me through these next few days
in school I'm sure many of you can
relate I just want to share with you
guys obviously from the title of this
video my Spring Break essential so that
you guys know well I'm definitely
bringing for spring break and maybe
it'll help you guys out with what you
should bring to if you are traveling
this is so exciting that I can finally
announce this it doesn't feel real I
feel so lucky and so blessed
you guys know pink right okay so they
reached out to me within the last couple
of weeks at first they were like you
just want to work on our Instagram
campaign with us and I was like let me
think yes I'm in love with pink like
this is funny but all of my undies are
from that this shirt is from there I was
be not even kidding I wasn't planning
that like I really wasn't Almighty next
I get her from there just because
they're like shopping company and fit me
really well but yeah I just love them
forever so I know I can work with them
on Instagram and they also mentioned
that they were going to take two of
their favorite social influencers to
bring to Cannes known for their spring
break party and I thought nothing of
this I was like no way am I going to get
picked like there's a million people on
the campaign ball ball I'm not going to
happen then I got an email that said
exciting news I read the first line and
it was like you've been picked like
company came to I literally lost it I
was bouncing off the walls I was running
laps and my suite everyone's like are
you okay I was screaming at the top of
my lungs like I'm not kidding I noticed
I was like ridiculous but I was just so
excited because I just didn't think that
it was going to happen at all it just
really hit me how grateful I am for
YouTube and just like all the
experiences it brought me and this is
like such an incredible experience with
such an incredible brand that I've loved
for so long and the fact that I even get
to work with them is so just like unreal
and really humbling and I wouldn't have
been able to do without you guys next
week you're my actual spring break from
bu I'm going to be going to South
Carolina or like Charleston with my mom
and we're just visiting families can be
a really low-key it is it relaxing
vacation we're going to be there for a
week and then I come home for one day my
birthday March 11th and I fly out March
12th to go to Cancun with pink their
party is on March 14th and you guys can
expect lots of snapchats we'll be there
for a couple days when they come
basically I just need to be there
prepared for sunshine so that's why I'm
making this video I talked away too long
let's get into it
my first Spring Break essential is just
a bra and panty set from pink and this
is the new eyelash lace bra let
literally guys how cute and I just think
a bralette is so essential because you
want to be comfortable on spring break
and if you're going somewhere warm a
briella is like perfect to throw under
tank tops t-shirts literally they look
you with everything and they're just so
comfortable I honestly love this one and
I just realized this style of like the
halter and it just looks so pretty like
peeking out a book even a shirt like
this or like like I said tank top so so
q and then I just have the matching
panty obviously don't forget underwear
that would be horrible and another tip
that I would recommend is pack extra
underwear because if you're swimming
wherever you're going you'll probably
learn two or three different underwear
prepares during the day or at least I
lose you so I always tag like lots of
underwear when I travel then my next
essential would be definitely a skin
care product with SPF in it so I
described the a cosmetics your skin but
better CC cream because this has SPF 50
plus so this is just like amazing for
your skin they started using this
recently because my three main oh well
showed it to me and I was like this is
amazing where have I been on my leg
because it's so good for your skin
because it's because CC cream was like
anti-aging hydrating serum but it also
has such good coverage with this Lily's
full coverage and then really what sold
it for me is the smell of it it smells
like lemons like it smells so good but
really any skin care product with SPF
you should be good you want to protect
your skin especially when you're out in
the Sun this is going to sound dumb but
for me I always forget like food when
I'm traveling and you don't want to be
hungry like I am look culprit getting so
hungry so I let me just grab this little
Cornell bar to show you bring tools
where when you go in there and clean
because you don't know whenever you be
able to get food when you're on the
plane or a layover something and I
always end up being really hungry at
simply so just throwing this little
granola bar and your bag will save the
day especially if you look a long flight
to Mexico or wherever you're going miss
grab the Larabar peanut butter cookie
one this is literally my favorite type
of granola wherever if you have
insurance are bars so super good and the
peanut butter cookie one really just
tabling a cookie but it's like better
pukes which mean that is for me dates
peanuts and sea salt but yet really any
snack should suffice
of course I grabbed so much sunglasses
and I just grabbed a pair of these
classic ray-ban
creators are just the black ones with
the gold frames because don't forget it
sound gases especially these ones are
polarized I mean if you don't get
polarize ones is probably fine to large
ones I know we're just really good to
protect your eyes especially if you're
inside a lot actually this is the same
shirt so this is like the white v-neck
from pink and then this is just a dark
green bean extra pink I've been obsessed
with this gorgeous green color recently
I don't know why I just think I really
it looks like against like blonde or
something I don't know
yeah these are just both the same and
literally I need to always remember to
pack just company short sleeve shirts
like this because I never have enough
t-shirts - just like wear during the day
or to sleep in like I always have way
too many fancy clothes but then appear
just like going to breakfast or lunch
and you're like wait I can't wear like a
ball gown and heels you know what I mean
so I always have to remind myself to
pack extra just like basic t-shirts and
hang cops I think this videos just
reminding me to like be sensible because
I always cut the random stuff instead of
like the necessities so these are like
my spring break necessities we just got
my rainbow flip-flops because you guys
need a good pair of Beach flip flops
there's another thing I do I bring like
a bunch of layers of cute sandals and
whatever and literally remember on one
trip I think it was in South Carolina in
Charleston again I really would have to
wear like Steve mattis sandals for the
beach because I didn't just have a good
pair of flip-flops so make sure your
beach flip-flops because obviously you
need them when you're at the beach but
also it give you're just feeling comfy
casual you can wear them around and
these ones are obviously so old and
dirty and gross but almost are that way
because they're really broken and comfy
so literally any pair of like comfy
beautiful fossils ooh I described an
eyelash curler and mascara because I
look keep it really natural and like
light when you're like going to the
beach or somewhere warm so again with
just like a BB cream or a CC cream like
this I would really probably only do
that on my face and then fries I'll
really just try mascara like right now
I'm only wearing mascara and I think it
just like accentuates your natural
beauty so I just grab this like
covergirl blast Cara any mascara will do
and especially you can get like
waterproof mascara if you feel like
you're going to wear it like out of the
fugitive stuff and then an eyelash
curler because sometimes really what I
do is I won't even saw on mascara if I
know I'm going to be at the beach I'll
just curl my eyelashes because I think
it's so simple and you would really
think about it but I honestly make such
a difference just make sure I pop a
little more and then last but not least
obviously some swimsuits have this a
banjo top underneath pink a little Rouge
the bottom everything this video that I
can find the link to a link down below
definitely I know the new eyelash lace
scroll up from pink which is so cute I
don't just launched for the
Spring Break collection I'll definitely
have that link down below I don't even
need to say this to thank you so much
