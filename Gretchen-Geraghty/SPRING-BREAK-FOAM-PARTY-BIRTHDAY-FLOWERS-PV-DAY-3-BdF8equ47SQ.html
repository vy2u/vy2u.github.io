doing some video stuff and I think it
like to burn anyway but I am missing
quality sense I'm coming back out now

beach and lay in the Sun and just hang
out as gals everyone else is like living
there College Spring Break if you know
what I'm saying and this pool right here
that's like right outside of our door is
like the biggest main one and I'm like
scared of what's in that pool you don't
have to say it so there's always like
800 million people in there with all
their drinks and dancing and there's so
much foam I'm going to show you guys
right now look at this

mean like just being around like really
loud crazy college kids started to like
drives me nuts you know and I'm like
completely extroverted but like I don't
know it's like maybe I'm changing I
don't know but yeah I literally just
like fell asleep in the Sun I was laying
in my stomach
my back was getting jammed because I was
laid on the back whole time so my back
wasn't an but now hopefully I got tan
tan I don't know um but I just feel like
so out of it it was like sleeping in my
own little island it was good to just
like have a good night of sleep and like
not drink or like dance and party and
just like
run our bodies into the ground you know
21x Aldo is I feel like most people's
ears of like going crazy and like
drinking and whatever I've dug it to me
my ear to like focus I'm like my hell
and kind of prioritize that this has
been nice to find my moment of peace oh
and I've like recently just found out
today that I'm like obsessed with
Frankie's bikinis and I wanna buy all of
them and Frances I've only worn one ever
and this is a it's um Anna's but Taschen

like comfy too so I really want to go
buy like every single one yeah okay I
need like go back and stop being like
weird but we got like it was a huge
blizzard
last night and we have snow needs today
I'm pretty sure like every school in
Boston does
Maggie was snapping me like covered in
snow but bundled up and I just think
it's really funny that I like to mist it
when I'm here I'm kind of sad I missed
it like smoothies are fun in college to
hang out with all your buddies we found
it with the mystery flowers are from
earlier I logged when you sent us the
picture and I was like oh my gosh it's
the hotel like how did they know it was
