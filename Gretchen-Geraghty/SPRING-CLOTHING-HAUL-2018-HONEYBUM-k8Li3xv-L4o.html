company for you guys and I love doing
whole videos you're so fun and I know
you guys like them too and everything
I'm gonna be showing you you ready
guessed it termini bum my favorites
wherever they've so many cute clothes
and yeah without further ado let's just
jump on in
so the first thing I got from honeyBun
which i think is so cute it's just
bodysuit and I think it's just like
literally you so cute and like trendy
and like edgy and just adorable it
really reminds me my big mat and I know
you would love this my friend Liv I feel
like you would love this too it's like
this is your guys sign but it's just
like so cute and I love how it like
laces up this side like that it's just
as black clean bodysuit I like that it's
like a thong bodysuit too so you don't
have like underwear lines and I like the
white and the black details on straps
and Oh before I forget to mention I know
you guys can use Christian 20 for 20
percent off of everything in this haul
video and I'm gonna try to act more
normal in my calm in this haul video
don't worry I haven't got a soul cycle
yet today I'm going for 30 and it's only
156 or dad so I'm not like that hyper
I'm usually normally a pretty hyper
person so that's why I was like so crazy
in the last haul video I posted because
I literally filmed it at 10 a.m. and
there's a lot of hurtful comments on
that video being like you're annoying or
just saying other things and I just
wanna let you know that I would never
put up a video that I didn't want myself
to people portrayed that way and does
that make sense that didn't make sense
I don't know you got you know what I
mean like um yeah I just wouldn't want
anyone to think of me and like a
negative way and like literally what
happened is like I went to SoulCycle I
was like really hyper like after I
workout I'm just like DC DC like so
happy in the best mood so I was just
acting crazy that my best friend from
home was here so I was just like in a
mood you know and people were just
saying hurtful things so I just wanted
to say that really quick so I'm gonna
try to act more like calm normal in this
video so sorry if I I don't know
whatever moving on okay I got this red
sweatshirt which is just this plane
right it's my church and I mean
no cleaner and sweatshirt so I like this
it's like really stretchy and just comfy
and I really like athleisure and this is
like perfect for a things you're just
like chillin you know what I mean um
let's do my next everything ooh ooh
definitely this black t-shirt I think
this is so cute on t-shirt but like cute
little top like this black shorts like
top it just likes to choose up the front
it's like ribbed and it's just like so
flattering and cute on so I really
enjoyed this piece and I get a lot of
tops from honey bum this is like my
favorite top of all time if you might
have actually like recognized it from
another honey bum home video that I've
had and just black um long-sleeve like
off the shoulder top it's like ribbed
and it's like really really cropped as
you can tell and I yeah I actually had
it before but then actually my big that
still has it heyno so I just got it
again because like everyone loved it and
like everyone always wants to borrow it
and wear it so then now me and my
friends if - yeah we could marry more
you know now now we can't win but anyway
this is so cute and it actually comes
with like bottoms that go with it like
kind of high waisted leggings that are
like ribbed as well but I don't know
where they are but it comes with us you
can read it as like a cute little set so
yeah oh wait a minute I didn't even
notice this okay this is also a set this
is just like a really cute black tank
top and I just tried on the black tank
top by itself but I didn't even see this
little guy it's like a set it's like a
skirt that goes with so this black crop
tank top I know I got cropped black tank
top is just so simple and you could
probably get one from like anywhere but
I really enjoyed this one because I
really fit fit oh just like how it looks
on it's like really soft and comfy and
just like fits perfectly and I like the
length of it too it's like it's good I
don't have cropped if you don't I mean
and I guess it comes with this matching
just like black tight skirt to go with
so it can be a cute little matching set
okay then I got this red bodysuit which
is so cute guys I actually thought at
first that like this was the front and
it like tied in the back but then I
noticed all the little adjustable parts
this wraps from that part so that's
definitely back and then I know it
definitely ties in the front and I think
you have to wear it with just like
really high waisted stuff so that it
like covers the top of the bottom of the
body
- if that makes sense I'm gonna being so
confusing in this video but as you can
tell what I'm trying it on like you can
see like the red part like above my
skirt and I don't know if it's supposed
to be like that can you guys let me know
how you're supposed to wear I think
you're supposed to really really high
waisted stuff so you just see the part
where like ties maybe I don't know but
yeah it's just like ties over your boobs
it's like a little revealing but I just
think it's so cute and I really like it
and then I got this tan body so it's
just like that one except for its tan
and the style is different
okay the straps just survive each other
I don't really know but it's just like
this square neck and I really like that
look with just like the skinny straps
it's just plain tan little bodysuit so
yeah and then I think I'm speeding
through this again I'm going so quickly
yeah I am oh my gosh um but then I mean
I guess being concise is like good and
also I got this red or it's like reddish
pink I would say this isn't like a true
red like member okay I have this over
here
remember this red lace bodysuit I from
honey bun these are like different
colors I feel anyway so is this kind of
like reddish pink but it's like this
halter top lace in the front and I love
the back of it how it's like always I
think this is really cute this gives my
Coachella vibes or just like it's
obviously very summery so I'm really
excited for that like in the summer and
then Wow last but not least I was a
quick little haul video I got this kind
of it's called Terry this material I
think terry cloth it just feels like a
towel obviously but I saw it on there I
thought it was like so cute for like
this summer and like if I like get out
of the shower you know it's just like
white and pink and black like stripes
and like stretchy and it like fits
really well and it's super comfy it's
it's almost like a romper kind of I
didn't think of it like that but like
it's like a romper I guess but it's like
obviously very casual and just comfy and
cute and I really like it so yeah
everything I got from honeyBun I really
enjoyed all that don't forget you can
use version 24 20% off everything on the
website and thank you so much for
watching I'll see you next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
