video for you guys I've been you need to
film this whole video in particular for
a while because I've been doing a bunch
of shopping in the last couple of weeks
I'm scared I'm gonna be forgetting
something we're just gonna roll with it
so let's get on into it sorry for the
weird setup right now too you can see
April like chillin in the back and I
just got the selfie fly but it's going
to find its home for it's got to go
somewhere in my room but there's
literally no space underneath the other
walls because I already have enough
people on right there whatever is fine
so the first two things I have traitors
from LS and the first one is this red
dress which you guys have seen me wear a
bunch I wore it in the video where I was
talking about sorry Harvard and it's
just this red dress the cute little
choker top and it's like knit and just
body con and really cute and then I also
have another choker style top in my lap
it's just as green a sweater it's a
little bit cropped then I just got these
booties from Ella but I forgot to show
while I was filming but they're so cute
they're kind of like western looking and
I just love the cutouts in the heels I
just have some stuff from Anthropologie
and a bunch of you guys were asking me
where I got this pink tank top from it
just really cute satiny silky pink flowy
tank top and as these really cute like
gold details right there it's really
weird right now because all seven of my
suitemates are gone this weekend so my
door is open and I just feel so like
free but like lonely it's so weird like
I'm filming my door burnout I don't have
to worry about anyone else because
everyone's hot anyway the next thing I
got from Anthropologie is just this blue
blouse and I think this is so beautiful
it's just yeah light blue has details
this leaves like flare out a little bit
and these are birthday presents for my
mommy thank you mom
I'm honest thing I got from
Anthropologie I got for myself it's just
this sweater it's like blue and
off-the-shoulder
and I don't know where it is right now
it's literally round somewhere but here
it is oh look from the wall can we stop
by the Lilly Pulitzer store and I got
this really beautiful white off the
shoulder top I've been wanting and off
the shoulders up like this for a while
honestly I kind of regret getting it
remotely polo to them because I feel
like you could probably find this like
Everton won
anywhere so there's probably way more
expense than agency but regardless I
think still cute I know where to March
and then this dress guys is literally
beautiful it was the only one last it
was my size and I was like this is a
sign a my turn it on and it's just so
used I love it I don't know where yet
but I'm gonna find something part
because I was this beautiful gold like
detailing and what I love is that it
goes around on the back so this is like
a pretty fancy dress I just fit
perfectly then I went to ham at Urban
Outfitters are we surprised it's
literally my favorite store ever
I got this black kind of like cowl neck
cropped sweater and I've wanted this
specific one for a while actually
because I saw in the store and I loved
it and then all of these I just got on
the dough shopping app you guys know I'm
obsessed with though I literally don't
even need to talk about except talked
about before but I'm pretty sure if you
use the code Gaucho and you still get
you like your five dollars off and free
shipping if you haven't used it before
this is just really comfy and cute and I
love the way it looks with your hair
like up looking a bun or like a ponytail
mckylie to jeans and this is so random I
actually got two pairs of underwear
these I didn't know we're like this
high-waisted like what eyes let me try
them on as you can tell with like the
tag on I have this in like the bralette
version it's just this really soft like
stretchy material so literally I'll just
wear it like bed like the bra and undies
when I get really hot I've been so hot
like sleeping or somebody so anyway
these will be fun we'll see how yeah
we'll see how that goes and then I have
the Calvin Klein grey like bra let talk
and I used to have the gray like unused
to go with and I little awesome like I
can't behind them anywhere so like okay
I'll just buy easier because I don't
know the matching set just makes me feel
put together and fun
and then these black high-waisted jeans
I actually already have in urban
outfitters but I've had them for
literally ever I've had them I'm pretty
sure to the eighth grade yeah yep I got
a May 8th grade and they were just super
like we're not even worn out they still
look good and I still have them and I'm
a just sophomore in college so they whoa
9 3 times great 11th grade 12th grade
freshman year sophomore I've literally
happen for six years and they're still
holding strong so like good job Urban
Outfitters with your jeans yeah I just
have them for so long that I wanted like
a blacker newer pair
and they're like literally the same same
size same style but the only thing
that's different actually is these I got
a shorter inseam because the other ones
are like pretty long and I like cut them
but I wish I got the longer ones again
because these are the shorter ones and
you guys know I'm 5 9 so literally there
like ankle Panza me but it's fine Urban
Outfitters will always have my favorite
black house jeans then I just saw this
car to get and literally my friend
Hannah when she saw this she's like
Gretchen what the heck my whole clothing
rack right there is like tan and like
cream sweaters this is kind of different
though this color I thought was actually
really unique it's kind of like a
grayish taupe but it's just like this
really slouchy style I actually have the
same sweater Bourbon Outfitters and like
a dream so I already know I love this
it's like so soft and comfy and you can
like throw it over an outfit I love the
outfit I wore the other day with these
black hurry to do this in like a white
like high neck tight like crop top it
looks so good so you'll see the buy off
of the week oh and then from Urban
Outfitters I just grabbed this - this is
a Mario Badescu drying lotion it's been
literally working wonders on my skin -
you guys know I'm still like using
ecology and everything but I v like a
really really annoying like big pimple
or a really problem spot I'll put some
of this on it and literally it like
dries it up by the morning this is like
such a good spot treatment and it
literally says do not shake and what I
just did before this video is shake it
so I hope it's okay but I would highly
recommend and then those of you know me
best no it wouldn't be a deal be home
video without some Lululemon but
actually I haven't gone so from the
lemons so long and I feel like so many
my recent haul videos have it as I'm
alone but GLB is back in action guys so
I just got this playing a black sports
bra this is like the Y sports bra I'm
pretty sure that's why it's cold but I
already know I really like this type of
sports more because I really have it in
so many cars I have a blue and I look at
some study color one I have green and
then my favorite type of leggings from
them now are the Wonder under high-rise
ones and I already have one pair of
plain black ones I just have to get a
new pair because I just felt like I wear
them all the time when I get
I don't know it doesn't sound ridiculous
but my dresser right there I have an
entire drawer just for legging but
literally I live in them and I wear them
like every day so yeah why not this is
like very worth it for me and I'll
highlight when the high-waisted ones
because I don't know I just something
are the high waist ones out they really
suck you in and it could be like skinny
so I like them then I stopped by forever
20 woman I knew Barry the other day just
because I needed some of these no-show
saw so I got two different packs these
ones I already ripped open it's almost
like two black and a gray and this one's
like two black and like a nude and then
I just got five pairs of white ankle
socks and also I highly recommend these
no show socks because I already wore one
pair and they're good and for three
pairs it's 490 so like that is a good
deal okay I know last thing that I show
you guys are just shoes from Zoo shoe
and I did a hole after the week like
wearing all these shoes during the week
and there's to be a giveaway and stuff
so definitely like go check that out if
you haven't seen that yet but the first
there I got or just these really key
little booties it looks so awesome on
camera - they're like kind of like
distressed looking and I wear them to
brunch other morning I got so many
compliments on them and they're by
Freebird by Steven I think it's like a
little section of Steve Madden I believe
it's like a little line that they do I
don't know also from Steve Madden I just
got these little tan like toe booties
you can never have enough foodies you
guys know I love booties and then I got
these little shoes which lucy has had
forever and I've always liked them and
then I was like you don't finally why
not get them so they're just like the
black quilted little sneakers those are
so important they're like so convenient
to just slip on and then these are
literally adorable but they're just
these really cute black little booties
and I just feel so fab and I walk in
these are really like clickety - like
when you're like walking down the hall
these ones remind me of what are those
ones called it'll just like these like
the Jeffrey Campbell ones like I really
like the big flick split down the side I
think these are just really fashionable
like the toe is look a little more
pointed and then I just got these black
shoes you're activating tonight for a
little sorority then and these are the
brand Bella Marie they're just black
little suede heel that are like perfect
for like I'm here in a sorority I'd like
I just keep talking sorority stuff
because they're just like really simple
and they're like a little bit shorter so
they won't be like way too uncomfortable

watching the whole video and I'll see my
next

top of my hanger but anyway</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
