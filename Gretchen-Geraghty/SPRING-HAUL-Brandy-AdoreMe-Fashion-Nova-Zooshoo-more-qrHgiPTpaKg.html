haul video and I just have some dresses
some other clothes and some shoes that I
just picked out for the spring season
some things like aren't so springy too
so don't come at me because sometimes I
feel like I make videos where I show
like clothes and stuff for like a
specific season and then like I shall I
call sweatpants in the summer and that's
just like how it is sometimes so don't
get mad at me if I do that but yeah I
have a bunch of different stuff to show
you so let's just get into it so the
first couple of things I have to show
you are from this website called adore
me and adore me is basically a
subscription service for like lingerie
and bathing suits and stuff and I know I
showed them before in a haul video and I
got a bunch of bathing suits from there
but today I have just like some bras and
underwear and abida need to show you and
they just have it super cute bras and
underwear on there and you can get like
a new pair every month with their like
VIP membership program I'm pretty sure
it's called
if you're looking new remember it's only
29.95 so I mean that's just a really
good idea if you like getting new bras
and underwear all the time and they were
cute so you can check it out I'll have
it linked down below so the first one I
got is just this light pink really
pretty lace strapless bra well it's a
convertible so it has straps but you can
make it like strapless too and I think
this one is so cute like I don't know if
you guys know but I wear like strapless
nude bras like pretty much every day
because honestly I'm too lazy to put the
straps on I'm not even kidding that's
why that's why my strapless ones and so
this is just really cute and I will wear
it because it's strapless and yeah it's
just as pretty like pink color and it
also comes with matching undies woo and
then also for those of you that don't
know I'm flat-ass bored and don't have
any boobs so I got this bra and it's a
hip superficial one it's like super
pushup and it just has like this black
lace on the front but like come on this
one's like really pretty guys like I
need really cool also fun fact I just
let my roommate this the other day and
if you wear a matching bra no underwear
I'm pretty sure you're like more
productive or you like feel better about
yourself so of course I got the matching
undies oh yeah I got this black bathing
suit which I seriously think is so cute
it's just like this high-necked one in
my fifties are very in fashion right now
or at least in my sense they are looking
I can take
I can't take myself seriously I gotta
get through this okay and like pictures
and survives you know Instagram I feel
like just hi next bathing suits or like
in like they're just like really pretty
and like you know more like fashionable
than just normal bathing suits and this
one has all these like cutouts down the
front it's super cute and it just comes
with these black normal bottoms and I
think they're a little cheeky so yeah
that's fun I know I talked about sushi
before and I have some more shoes to
share with you guys because obviously
for the spring like you need more shoes
I just decided I needed some more
sandals and I have some from Steve
Madden Sam Edelman and Dolce Vita
Dolce Vita how do you can say that don't
say Dolce anyways I know you talked
tarazu shoe before like I said it's like
this not shoe website they probably have
other stuff too I think and they have so
many good brands if you Madden Sam
Edelman I love those brands and usually
it's really hard to find like the right
sizes and stuff at least I know on Steve
Maddens website because they like sell
out so quick so as you shoes like really
good for stuff like that so many
different cue shoes yeah so all of these
shoes that I'll be showing will be
linked down below and also there's like
a little keep-away going on so check

the first pair I have to show you are
just these Dondi that's what they're
called white sandals well they're like
white and brown and you guys know I have
these in brown and they're like one of
my favorite sandals ever so I'm really
happy I got them and white because I'll
just go really cute with like shorts and
dresses and whatever and they're really
simple and I just like them a lot and

and they're really cute they're just
like a silver they're not silver their
gold and they're like this like
snakeskin
type one and also these are just very
simple and super cute and I think they
can like dress up your outfit a lot for
this spring and they're nice and I think
they're eight and a half - because
that's my size and then I have two pairs
from Dolce Vita and these ones are
seriously
cute they're just all black with like
some cool details and these ones are a
little bit more fancy and I like them a
lot too and in my last pair from Dolce
Vita or just these tan ones that have
some gold accents on the top and these
ones are seriously adorable too like I
said I feel like these ones from Dolce
Vita are a little bit more fancy you can
wear them with like I don't know more
fancy dresses and such oh my shoes from
Azusa will be at full estate down below
so you can go check them out if you're
interested

realized all the shoes like on our

website with a bunch of cute clothes and
I got a bunch from there recently so I'm
super excited to show you but first pair

not like that springy but like I still
wear jeans in the spring and it's still
kind of cold like on the East Coast you
know because believe it or not I don't
have plain black like low waisted jeans
I have high waisted ones you know I do
some normal one so these are super cute
and I can't wait to wear these so then I
got this plain white dress it's just
like this swing dress and it goes kind
of higher in the front and like lower in
the back I love shirts that are open in
the back too I just think they are like
a really cute like addition Josie
stretchy and comfortable I love this
material by the way and then I just got
this black dress which is like a little
bit more fancy for more like fancy
occasions I guess and it just has like
this detail on the top and it's just
short sleeve I realize the fit of this

little intense but I know it's gonna be
super cool for like concerts especially
over the summer and just as royal blue

like one of my favorite colors ever and
it just has these really really cool
detail on the front in the back like how

shorts or like a skirt or something this
is like the same type of dealio top just
like you know crop top good for like if
