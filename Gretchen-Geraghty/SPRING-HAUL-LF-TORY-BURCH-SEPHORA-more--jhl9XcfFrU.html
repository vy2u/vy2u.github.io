haul video for you guys because I've
been doing a lots of it shopping
recently and if you are new to my
channel hi it's me Gretchen don't forget
to subscribe if you haven't already it
is a write down below what you mean
inside when I post new videos and as
always it don't forget to follow me on
all of my various social medias you can
keep updated even when I'm not listing
videos and if you like this video be
sure to give it a big thumbs up so I
know you like my haul videos and without
further ado let's get on into it so the
first place I went to foreclose is LF
and I just went through chrome in this
past weekend for a rush here at BU in
tonight's big night I'm so nervous like
I really hope I get my first choice but
anyway I went to a ttle up to it pick
out dresses for prep night which was
last night whoa it already feels like so
long ago I think I got it out Wow oh yes
oh I got both of these at dresses for
prep night which was last night and
wanted options on which one to wear and
obviously I went with all black I sort
of knew that I was all along it's hard
even oh my god this red one yeah I just
got this a black dress from LF as you
can see it on it's just like a choker
dress it goes high up and it's just like
this black suede material that was so
soft and comfortable I got so many
compliments on it literally everyone
said it was like the cutest thing ever
and then when I was at LS I actually
found these heels in the dressing room I
asked the girl who was working in the
dressing room I'm like are these like
for sale like can I buy them and she was
like sure cuz I try these on with a
dress and like these are so cute and
like perfect to wear with it so they're
just like these nude heels feel like tie
around your ankles so yeah that's so
cute I have a lot of compliments on
these - everyone is so nice to brother
Brandon shut as CH you tease
yeah I've never heard of that before but
oh my gosh it literally says in the
bottom has the Eligius found on the
bottom it said they were initially at
185 that's so insane I got this during
their like 60 percent off sale and same
as that dress so they were so affordably
I definitely recommend to go to LF it
during their like 60 percent off sales
because everything that becomes way more
affordable than how it usually is I just
got this red dress from Urban Outfitters
because just like this fit-and-flare
like skater dress and I like the
neckline at the top - I think it's
really cute I don't know what that
necklines call but it's like really
pretty through back it's just like a
little scoop and there's a zipper so
this is super cute and if I get my first
choice and all the feeds nothing their
colors are red and I'll get a lot of
wear out of this red dress so grabs your
fingers oh my gosh by the time I'm
editing and posting this video I already
know so nervous last like clothing a
shoe I don't have to show you it's just
around Tory Burch literally I'm such a
loser
I saved like so much packaging in this
video to show you because I felt it cool
being like woohoo but literally I wear
these all weekend and I just wear them
to class today so I just put them back
in the box for a dramatic effect but I
just got these all black Tory Burch
flats makes like every other mother has
these and literally my friend was like
Gretchen you don't already have those
like how do you never have them so guess
I'm really late on the bandwagon but the
dress is black suede flats and I like
the gold detailing and they're still
comfortable like everyone during
recruitment cuz you're walking around so
much was like complaining about how
their feet hurt and literally these were
brand new and you'd think I'd have like
Brickman and they'd be uncomfortable at
first and I've had so many flats that
are so comfortable these are so
comfortable they haven't had my feet at
all and I don't know if it's because
we're like bunching in the back or
they're just like squishing on the
bottom but these are really nice quality
flats because my feet didn't hurt at all
alright moving on to civil round so bad
I literally have an obsession guys so
the first thing I'll show you is very
quickly becoming a favorite is the
cosmetics your skin but better CC cream
there's SPF 50 anti-aging hydrating
serum color correcting full coverage
green basically it's just like really
good stuff that's really good for your
skin I got the shade medium but it's so
insane how full coverage this is guys my
sweet maid Noel showed it to me and I
actually tried hers out in light and it
was like too light for me maybe was a
little bit too dark but you know
whatever I like being tan or pretending
to be tan but this is so insane this is
like more people covered to them like my
full coverage foundations but it's CC
cream so it has like good stuff in there
for you better than just like foundation
and it doesn't make me break out and on
top of that literally what sold me like
readies I borrowed hers for day and I
really want to score the next day I got
this
it smells like lemons it smells so good
I can smell it just by going like that
oh my gosh if you guys have acne prone
skin like me you need to trust out the
only thing I thought that might be an
issue is since it is SPF 50 I think if
I'm taking photography with flash I
might have it like white cast my face I
think that happens from high as PS
foundations I don't know we'll see I
haven't tried it out yet so well you
know you'll be updated when I save the
little bucks to show you guys why
Gretchen next from Sephora I just got
the first date Beauty ultra Repair Cream
and this I've used of Michael Voris
smells so good a favorite moisturizer
ever it's just the best and I actually
just showed it in my very favorites
video so it is a favorite and always
using like a little wine but I just got
this really big one and you guys didn't
know my eyebrows are lily is so drawn on
because I have the worst like a natural
eyebrows but these have come like a long
way because they used to be like
horrible and I really like how they are
right now I like them like thicker like
this I think they go with my face better
I have a really big head so anyway
everyone comes here any 100 real quick
and it's all because of Anastasia
Beverly Hills brow is in soft brown is
my shade I went through this pencil so
quick like my last one literally ran out
in one so I just picked up this one wait
let's see let's roll it up in CL woman
oh my god is this gonna get break I'm so
nervous I just want to see how long it
is
I feel like you would think it'd be the
whole pencil but it definitely isn't cuz
I went through it so quick this is so
dangerous of me why am I doing this I'm
scared I'm scared I don't want to roll
it up anymore it's gonna make it break
time yeah yeah bad idea Gretchen bad
faith really play around 20 bucks oh
it's not that bad but I'd rather not
have to buy anyone every month so am i
doing something wrong look I literally
put so much in my eyebrows but I don't
know I still love this it's still so
good use the pomade for a while
but then I realize I like the way my
eyebrows looked when I had this better I
think I'm more control when the pomade
is just too like free hands for me like
you have to use a brush and this just
makes it easy because any little pencil
so I really love this just let me know
and you guys like run out of yours super
quick and I literally go through it so
quick
then I just got these at Sephora
collection eyelashes because I've never
tried any other fake eyelashes and the
ones I'm wearing right now and I get
questions out these all the time these
are just the kiss every Z 11 lashes I
think and literally you can't find them
anywhere so I always order them like in
bulk online if I can find a link I like
them down below because I love these and
same with everything else in this haul
video I will have a link down below but
yeah I just wanted to try out some new
ones so these are the recal number 22
lash yeah these look pretty dramatic so
these are exciting to try it out the
last thing I got from Sephora is just
the detox at dry shampoo but from my dry
bar just looks like this I went to drive
our the first time this weekend and I
was obsessed I was like this is
literally my place how have I never been
here like I just love I'm gonna go all
the time now but my friend Carrigan
actually showed me their dry shampoo and
it smells so good it smells just like
your hair once you leave there and it's
like shampooed and conditioned in there
it is really it smells so good
and I would show recommend for blondes
because when I put it at the top of my
hair it makes it like a little bit wider
so especially when I love roots I'll use
a bunch because they'll like help blend
my blonde hair and my brown roots but I
just got my hair done so it's like not
bad right now but this smells so good
and I mean it would probably find your
brown hair - you just have to like rub
it in more so you don't
that weight like powdery look at the top
you know it's amazing such a good dry
shampoo and now I don't have to steal
Carrigan's anymore
and I just got this asked in an a via
post makeup recovery spray and I've been
using this recently after you take off
your makeup you just spray it all over
your face I'll just tell you what it
says are zinc infused most rapidly
replenishes and lost nutrients and
moisture immediately after removing
makeup hi purified witch hazel and
gentle exfoliant help prevent clogged
pores that can lead to breakout I need
that because my skin is are so acne
prone you probably looks okay right now
but there is a bunch of pimples like
hiding under here directions apply
within five minutes of removing makeup
spray two to four times yeah I always do
that because right after I remove my
makeup I just oh yeah I've been liking
this I will keep you guys updated on how
it's doing with my skin then like I said
I got my roots and recently in Boston at
a new hairdresser and she was asking me
if I use like a deep conditioning
treatment and I never had and she music
recommended it and I don't know if you
guys know about olaplex but basically
it's just like this deep conditioning
treatment that you can get at a salon
from what I know
Faye's wanting to you can only get done
at the salon it's like an oil treatment
and then I don't know something else and
then phase early number three and bye so
I just got this on Amazon and they're on
like 20 bucks that says like olaplex
number 3 use once a week between
chemical services to strengthen hair a
hair Perfector so I'm gonna start using
this and again I will keep you updated
on my feelings towards it because I'm
excited it's like this little bottle but
good things can come in little packages
so we will see okay who else is obsessed
from ordering all for Sephora to because
you literally get so many samples I love
it I just have a bunch of makeup from
covergirl to show you and they're not
like paying me to show this in this
video I just want to show you guys
because I've actually loved this
foundation for so long so when they
reached out to me and said like do you
want to work together I was like um is
that even a question like yes if you
guys have seen my old makeup videos and
hauls and stuff this has been a favorite
foundation for so long because if you
guys know my skin gets oily so quick and
this is literally the one foundation but
I think my skin that doesn't get oily
with it like stays matte so I just have
it two shades the covergirl outlast
all-day stay fabulous at 3 in 1
foundation that is a mouthful Wow in 842
and 845 medium beige and warm
and this I already used it's the outlast
all-day intense color a brilliant base
color and it kind of looks like maroon
if you're looking at it but literally on
it was more of like red I don't know if
you guys saw my post on insta is with
this so I really like this board on
Valentine's Day out to dinner then I
just have the covergirl outlast all-day
matte finishing powder and eight to the
thirty
it's just perfect I've been using it so
much and then I have the covergirl
outlast all-day concealer and 820 light
pale and I've been using this literally
works so good I've been using on like
blemishes and it doesn't move and I've
been easy under my eyes as well and it's
so good and then I just got this in the
mail today actually it's the outlast all
day at custom Reds for light pale skin I
really like the way they do that
matching the lip shades with your skin
tone because I think that's a super
important and yet I just sees a little
lip glosses so super excited to try
these out as well and it's not I'm
actually wearing it right now it kind of
has come off a bit but I feel like it's
still like glossy if you can see it's
the covergirl outlast all-day intense
color brilliant in 100 nude intensity
and this I like because it's more of
like an everyday like I wear this to a
class and stuff whereas I'm not really
comfortable wearing like a super red
lipstick class and the last thing I have
to show you are just from Ecotools I got
some Ecotools brushes and I love their
brushes like forever like affordable but
they're so soft and obviously Ecotools
is really all about the environment so
I'm so about that and I think that's
super special and nice so I just has
these like makeup sponges and literally
guys I use the other day and it worked
exactly the same as my Beauty Blender
from Sephora which is like probably five
times the price so I would highly
recommend this it also comes with this
like little smaller when I feel like I
would use this for the cream bronzer and
then I have these little color
correcting minis and if you can't tell
my light pink when it's getting so gross
because I've been using it for like
underneath my eye like under-eye
concealer and then these ones are good
for other things like dark spots redness
stuff like that I lost one of them it's
around somewhere and last but not least
I have these eco tools at brushes this
is just the big fluffy powder one I've
been using this for just powder on my
face and this one is literally the
perfect size for contouring I've been
using it for contour like every single
day because I'm obsessed with bronzer I
don't know
tell like my studio lights kind of like
washing me out make me look a little bit
paler but literally I wear a ton of
bronzer every day so yeah I think that
is it for this haul video again
everything will be linked down below for
your convenience thank you guys so much
for watching I will see you next video
bye it's not wearing pants I never wear
pants when I feel but that's okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
