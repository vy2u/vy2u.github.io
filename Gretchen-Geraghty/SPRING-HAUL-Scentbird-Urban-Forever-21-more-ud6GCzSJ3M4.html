video for you and I guess I just
realized right now it's kind of summery
because I was thinking that it was a
spring haul but I guess a bunch of my
stuff is pretty summery like I got some
dresses and the weather is getting more
where I'm so excited like literally my
mood just like instantly increases does
that make sense my mood would just
become so much better when it gets
warmer out and it just makes me happy
and there's sunshine so yeah I'm really
excited to show you guys all this stuff
that I've got and recently for the
warmer weather and disclaimer some of
this stuff isn't for my mother like I
did get like leggings and stuff and like
sweatshirts but like you can still wear
those in the spring and summer when it's
chillier out so anyways and also I've
had a rough day so I'm hoping that
filming puts me in a good mood usually
puts me in a really good mood and
usually when I'm done pulling a video I
like can't stop smiling and I'm really
happy so the first thing I have to show
you is actually this perfume it's called
oh Lola by Marc Jacobs I'm pretty sure
Marc Jacobs right oh Lola yeah
Oh smells so good I like one in this
routine for so long and I just think
it's perfect for like the warmer weather
okay why do you only one like this I
feel kind of crazy but I feel like in
different seasons I like having
different scents so this is definitely
gonna be around like spring summer Sun
it just smells so good but basically it
is from this website called sin bird and
I know I talked about sin bird before
cuz I'm like obsessed I seriously love
it I can get such a good idea
and I like love trying out new perfumes
so basically if you don't know scent
birds just like an online subscription
service or a perfume and they have all
different kinds of perfume I've gotten
like Viva La Juicy from their Chloe
Donna care in New York be delicious and
I have Marc Jacobs oh Lola and it smells
so good I'll have it linked down below
in case you're interested and also
there's a discount code there so that
you can get 25% off of your first
perfume I'm pretty sure so sunburns
pretty sweet and you can go check it out
if you're interested and I really love
my new perfume now it smells good in
here
and then the next thing I'm going to
show you I've been waiting to talk about
for so long until I filmed a haul video
cuz I haven't thumbed a halt in quite a
while I feel like
but anyway it's this hat and if you guys
have seen my vlogs or Instagram pictures
and stuff or like even Twitter - I feel
like I've talked about this hat
everywhere
it's called love your melon and if you
guys haven't heard of love your melon
I've been obsessed with her company for
song and I've been like wanting to get
their hat but if you guys are familiar
you probably know that they sell out so
quickly like I remember I wanted the
gravy Nene for so long and it was always
sold out they like planned their
releases I'd go on like 20 minutes after
they were released and everything would
be sold out because their stuff is like
so popular so Taylor thank you so much
for like reaching out to me Taylor is
like a part of love your melon and she
sent me this so thank you so so so much
Taylor like you don't understand how
much I love this it makes me so happy
first of all the beanie is like so
comfortable and I just think it's so
cute this has made me into a hat person
but even more than all of that I'm just
totally for like the cause behind love
your melon if you guys don't know like
each hat you purchase one gets donated
to a kid with cancer so I think it's so
so good
if you saw my candy Club unboxing video
I was actually wearing this in there so
I'll have this link down below I like
love their hats so cute and they also
just came out with like really cute like
sweater like zip up type things and I
need to get one of those so yeah I love
this if you can tell I just talked about
it forever oMG I can't believe I forgot
to tell you okay well my recent favorite
that I literally have not taken off
since I got and I'm are these two
necklaces from a silver and strand if
you can see look out they all right I
just love them it's a good shark tooth
on the top and like a little moon on the
bottom
I'll have them linked down below because
I think they're so cute you can check it
out if you're interested and I have some
like miscellaneous stuff from like all
different places and this first thing I
just wanted to show you if it's romantic
loft and has all these elephants and it
was actually a present to me from a
Justin's grandma Gigi so thank you so
much Gigi I seriously love it I think
it's so cute and I'm so happy I can wear
it now that I'm finally showing it in
this video but I just think it's
adorable and you guys know I love
elephants speaking of which look at this
little guy that my mom got me for my
birthday I love it it's my new blue
elephant pillow
I think it's so cute and those of you
who know me does know that it wouldn't
be a GLP haul video without some
Lululemon's so oh my goodness I actually
feel crazy because I just realized all
the stuff that I have to show you from
Lululemon is actually black so basically
I don't know I guess I just wasn't
feeling adventurous or branching out at
all first thing actually is this scuba
hoodie that I'm wearing it's all black
and I just think it's really cute you
guys know I have a good gray zip-up I
can get this kuba hoodie that's kind of
like this and I love it
so I decided I would get it in black and
I wear it like all the time it's very
useful and comfortable and it goes with
everything from this black
I really like this a lot it's not start
by ordering online so that's why they're
in there I just have it's open them yet
so you guys are gonna like it think I'm
crazy but I don't know if you saw my
Lululemon collection video if you
haven't you probably should watch it
because it's super cool but basically I
have a bunch of Lululemon like wonder
unders are my favorite I'm wearing a
pair right now and my first pair that I
ever got of just plain black Lululemon
wonder unders I lost and I was like
heartbroken when I realized they were
gone because I always like so sad that I
lost them so anyways I have a bunch of
like ones with like printed bands at the
top but I lost my plain black pair so I
knew I had to get another one and this
is not anything I'm crazy I actually got
two ones these ones I'm just gonna leave
in here because my thinking is that I
should get two plain black pairs because
one day I'll either lose these or like
they'll get really old and pilly or
something and future grouching is gonna
think old Gretchen for buying yourself
two pairs so that one day when I'm like
dang like I really need another pair of
black leggings I'll have a pair like
stopped away in my drawer so those are
gonna be really good for future Gretchen
and like I said I just got two pairs the
plain black slender unders I also feel
like in my time of buying things from
Lululemon I feel like the material of
them has maybe changed a little bit like
these feel a little bit more like I
don't know how to describe it like
stiffen like thick and like I thought
the older ones are more kind of like
soft I don't know if that makes any
sense but one thing I do know is that
the price has definitely gone up because
these were $98 like come on the dilemma
I remember when I first started getting
the Wonder underpants I think they were
just 80 each which is like okay a
three-day Achilles it's honestly way too
much but like I said like I look I'm not
kidding guys I wear Lululemon wonder
unders every single day like there's not
a day that goes by that I don't wear
leggings so it's worth it to me to like
have good quality leggings and know what
I've talked about these for like a
million years I'm just happy I got those
and this I guess I'll just open up right
now I can't believe I just opened it yet
I was trying to like save all this stuff
to show you guys in a haul because I
like to not wear it until I show it or
else if I start wearing it then I forget
to show it in a haul you know what I'm
saying so I just got this black won't
sleep I guess
it's acolyte black okay that was a
little like a really dark gray but I
know it's called heathered black yeah I
think it's heather black or heather
slate I don't I don't know it's just
this long-sleeve shirt in a grayish
black color or whatever you call it and
I really know I think this is really
cute I have it at much different colors
and I didn't have a light black dark
gray color so I just thought why not and
the last thing is actually a present to
me from Taylor thank you so much Taylor
this is for my birthday and she knows me
best and knows that I love with women I
louia so many sports bras I like told
myself like gosh you're not buying
anymore Lululemon sports bras then
Taylor came in clutch even got me one so
I didn't have to buy one this one is
just plain black and it has all these
crisscross straps on the back and I
actually don't think I've seen this
style before so so excited it's the all
sport bra a three strap am I saying that
right I mean this is super cute and
really strappy and I know I'm gonna wear
it a bunch cuz I like living my
Lululemon sports bars also what else
what else
and two forever 21 and urban the other
day and I actually ordered a bunch on
urban and forever 21 after I went
shopping that day so that'll be another
haul coming soon
keep your eyes peeled like this and then
the one thing that I got from urban in
store was just this long-sleeve cream
shirt and it just laces up like that
I've noticed this little lace up trend
is like so in right now like every
single store has a million things that
are all laced up and I'm really into it
too I think it's so cute so I've been
buying a bunch of stuff that lace it up
like that in the front I forgot I threw
this up here to show you but I wanted to
remind myself to show this in this haul
video because it's called it's a 10
miracle even product and I remember this
is so funny I literally remember back in
the day when I first started YouTube I
remember people talking about this and I
wanted it so bad but I remember is so
expensive so I was like I can't do it
but then the other day I was at the
grocery and why did I get this oh I was
like traveling and I just want to look a
little like um leaving like hair
conditioner and it was looking the mini
Isle and I was like why not it's so cute
and I'm so happy I'm trying it out I
think it's made the ends of my hair like
really soft and healthy it also guys
look at how long my hair's been getting
I'm so happy
like I chopped it all off like two years
ago and it's finally like growing back I
feel like but anyway I like it this
one's so cute little and it's been
lasting URL too so you can probably just
get the little one if you're like not
that into spending way too much money on
the
sighs one because I probably went by the
polls I just want to be honest then I
went to pepper 21 and I seriously love
it there I hadn't been there and so long
and I feel like I usually have trouble
finding stuff there just because I get
really overwhelmed with like all the
clothes but I found - really cute
dresses in this first one it's just this
all-black one like I said lacing up the
front it's enduring now guys I know I
know I've seen it everywhere maybe it's
not in maybe just every place thinks
it's in so they sell these stuff anyway
I don't know I don't really know and
then there's lace all right there on the
top and then it's just black and flowy
on the bottom it's spaghetti strap and I
thought it was really simple and cute
and the only thing is I like didn't have
time to try these dresses on so I was
just like hopefully this is the right
size Gretchen that one's a little short
but you know when you're 5 9 everything
short and this actually isn't too short
I was pleasantly surprised Lucy told me
she thought it was kind of funny because
it had like literally like rope like
yarn straps but I thought that made it
kind of cool and it kind of looks like a
tablecloth almost but I don't know I
just thought it was really interesting
and different and I was like you know
Gretchen you're gonna like branch out
and I love like loose flowy dresses like
this oh and then also I got a big thing
of pearls like look at how crazy this is
you go from like baby ones to like huge
ones and if you can tell ones missing
right now because I put in like a medium
sized fair and if you guys know I love
pearl earrings and pretty much like only
wear pearl earrings and I actually
bought a couple pairs of real ones but
silly Gretchen I don't know how they
like fall out of my ears and I like lost
all of them so not gonna buy real pearls
anymore probably like the other day I
got my mom real pearls from Tiffany for
her birthday and it was like so fun and
chews so excited if you guys saw that
vlog I don't know if you've seen it if
it's going up before after this but
anyway so yeah I got her like real
Tiffany pearl earrings and like they're
seriously gorgeous and I love them and I
like wanting to buy myself a pair too
but then I remember kaya - is even like
Gretchen you can't buy like really
expensive real pearl earrings because
you couldn't even keep real ones when
you have them before and you would just
lose that male like fall out and I'm
like you're so right so I think I'm just
gonna stick with buying the like three
dollars and ninety cents a crumb forever
21 because you know they do the job the
only thing is sometimes they kind of
irritate my ears and bother them and
kind of make them infected so I just
have to be careful and I keep them clean
and stuff right now cheap ones will do
and the last if I want to
you is just the stuff that I got from
first aid beauty and I'm really excited
to show you guys what I got I haven't
tried it all out yep I'm excited to try
it out and I thought I would show you P
is one of my favorite moisturizers ever
is from first aid beauty I'm seriously
obsessed with it so this isn't that
moisturizer but I thought I would like
try out some of their other products to
you because I know I love that
moisturizer if you feel me so this first
thing is Flo glow gradual self-tanning
moisturizer so that'll be good
going into the warmer weather and this
is the cleansing body polish with active
at charcoal cool I actually have seen
charcoal like face masks that I love so
this is probably really cool I got some
gentle cleansing wipes these ones good
makeup removing cleansing wipes yep
remove stubborn makeup and usually I'm
too lazy to use those so it's good that
I got those because usually I just like
rub my um what's it called face cleanser
like on my eyes take it off my eye
makeup but those will be handy this have
actually tried a couple times it's the 5
in 1 face cream oh it says age delay but
it's probably still good for like young
skin I'd say because it like reduces and
prevents wrinkles corrects uneven skin
tone nourishes moisturizes see like I
need that anyway and to me it smells
like bananas I don't know if I'm going
crazy but it smells kind of a nanny so
that's cool then I got the ultra Repair
lotion and if this is anything like that
face moisturizer I love I love this this
is the ultra Repair wash oh this must be
like for your body cool this is face
cleanser oh I know I love this well I
think I love it because I love the face
moisturizer and this is the ultra Repair
pure mineral sunscreen moisturizer so
that's cool too and I guess I will like
keep you guys updated if I try these out
when I like but maybe in the vlog or
something so yeah that is everything
that I had to show you for this haul
video thank you guys so so much for
watching I'll see you in my next video
