huh we are going to film a story time
video and it's actually really funny
because I've never filmed a story time
video before because I never thought at
anything to talk about
but then Tasha was like crutching to
remember what happened just like three
summers ago like this would be such a
good thing to talk about and I was like
woah like guys it will literally blow
your mind like honestly it's actually
like so weird that it happened like it
feels like it's fake yeah because I have
been so long ago it's so it's so like
bizarre and it's like typical just like
I feel like people just being naive but
guy was just so stupid I was oh it's
fine I only like think the best of
people and Tasha's like Gretchen like no
like this isn't okay like we're getting
scammed so yeah we were talking about a
time when we got scammed by a youtuber
and like literally I'm so dumb like I'm
so done I mean you think of youtubers as
all I don't know it's like it's like
young people like their friends and then
all of a sudden like people are sketchy
yeah people aren't that nice sometimes
so basically this story starts three
summers ago August 2013 Gretchen and I
so I make videos too by the way
oh my and like whose idea don't know
Tasha is you should she's been in a
bunch of my videos before and I've been
in some of hers and she's firstly Tasha
here on YouTube you should definitely go
check her channel and subscribe if you
haven't already there's like way cooler
and has more subscribers than me so you
probably know she is but yeah you should
check out her channel anyway if you
don't know so yeah Tasha and I had been
friends for probably like I don't know
like a year at this point or something
or like a cup never met though in real
life yeah it was kind of before I met
yeah really we had we had like texted a
few times you know but we didn't like me
each other this was before youtubers
were like it was before YouTube was
really big you know yeah so I think
people like had their youtube friends
but they just kind of like texted and no
one really like hung out or anything
like that yeah
so it's kind of like that this was like
a long time ago yeah oh it was so
different
yeah and so basically what happened was
we're not gonna use okay so I'll just
tell you there's like six girls involved
in this and we are all just youtubers
and it's me and Tasha and like four
other girls and so what happened was one
girl had been like watching my videos
and like I talked to her a little bit
and now her channels gotten like really
big on YouTube so I don't wanna like say
her name - like involve her and we're
not gonna like say anyone's real name
except I think the girl that scammed us
because she's not making videos anyway
so I don't know we didn't know if people
would want to be in the video like about
I mean like it's not like they did
anything wrong but yeah just to be safe
yeah we just like won't mention them but
basically so this one girl who has like
a really big youtube channel now if I
said an in you definitely what is she
like started after me and Tasha and so
like when she started off she was just
like commenting on my videos like being
really nice whatever and I was talking
to her for probably like a couple months
and she was like oh like I had some
friends that we want to do like a
YouTube giveaway with like we can do a
summer like back-to-school giveaway and
you should be in on it with us like you
just like pay some money and then we're
all gonna like get a bunch of stuff and
like give it to someone who will win the
giveaway and like it'll be great so I
was like okay like sounds good to me and
then I don't remember exactly if she was
like wanting someone else to be a part
of the giveaway so that like it would
cost less for each individual person you
know but she was like oh like I think
she said do you have any other YouTube
friends that would like want to do it
with us and I was like my friend Tasha
like doll like totally so I asked Tasha
yeah so I remember I should ask me and I
like didn't really want to do it because
I never done anything like that she was
like yeah I can quickly like I don't
know I'm very like cautious for it yeah
and I thought it sounded like kind of
weird like I didn't know any of these
people
hmmm and what I thought was the weirdest
part was that she was just having us
send her the money
yeah she said oh I'll buy all the stuff
whereas I thought I mean I guess it
would be kind of hard for us to all buy
stuff individually and like send it to
one person yeah I just thought it was
kind of weird that we were like sending
this girl money like none of us really
knew each other
uh-huh but I mean I was friend as
Gretchen and I was like okay thanks yeah
I mean look I did agree and yeah so I
mean we we sent her the money I mean she
wanted like $50 from each of us so it
was like a pretty oh yeah I'm out I know
there was six of us so be all beed $50
that's literally $300 of stuff which is
like like a pretty good amount of stuff
I feel like very giveaway so also to
like back when I told him
back when I told my friends who is in
Tosha that like okay Tasha would do it
with us she made like a group message
with all these other girls and I'm just
gonna say right now like the girl that
scammed us her name is Alyssa and she's
not on YouTube anymore you probably
don't even know like what her YouTube
channel is I won't even say the name of
her YouTube channel because it wasn't
like Alyssa anything it was just like
you know like a name yeah and so
probably none of you like know she is I
think your channel was just like really
little at the time just like ours were
too but um yeah I know like right after
this happened she deleted her YouTube
channel she wasn't really in it for the
right reasons clearly and we had this
like group message going and yeah so she
said like just you know at PayPal me $50
each like everyone and then I'm just
gonna get all the stuff and I'll ship it
I wouldn't really and I like I was
thinking like stupid like young Gretchen
was like that's so nice I've heard her
like take her time to like get all of
our money together go buy this stuff
like ship it out I'm like that's so
sweet of Alyssa like why would you do
this for us that's so sweet so like
whatever and we post videos and I
actually just made the video private cuz
I didn't want you guys to like go to it
and like find like channels of the
people that were involved so because
like you know it's like a scam like I
don't know if I've ever even addressed
it I feel kind of bad that I haven't
addressed it but like I just was like in
the past it was so long ago so it was
like it was just like a back-to-school
giveaway like 2013 whatever and I just
like talked about it and was like
comment below to like enter and it was
like all this stuff and she had a
picture of all the stuff like she took
this one photo yeah I was like all the
items that were for the giveaway mm-hmm
and sent us all the picture and we were
all to like make that our thumbnail yeah
and she's like yeah I'll pick the winner
and we were all like okay and she never
really told us who the winner was she
said yeah she said she picked the winner
and then this is where the big youtuber
will call her like let's call her Sarah
Sarah I'll come there so you can okay
yeah so Sarah I think was more like
pushy on this because she she probably
started to feel a little bit sketchy
about it just because this girl Alyssa
who's like okay I picked the winner or
whatever I think we were all waiting to
be like okay like who's actually the
winner and like maybe where does she
live or whatever like confirmation that
she shipped it or whatever we never
really got honest I'm really talking
about it here I thought you know we'd be
like friends we did it together
but it kind of just like stop yeah so
Sarah I think goes ahead and like text
the screw message and is like okay like
who's the winner or whatever and she
thinking back she might even acted like
sketchy about it a little bit like oh
like the person didn't respond or like
oh like I had to pick someone new we're
like you know what I mean I thought it
was weird and also - I wish we could
show you guys like our actual messages
however this was like three summers ago
like obviously got like new phones and
stuff on them so I wish we had them but
we don't and so I think this ELISA girls
acting weird and so at this point I know
Tasha felt kind of weird about it and I
was probably still like hopeful like she
did the right thing like what she's
still gonna like ship it to someone and
Sarah is like going at it and it's like
if you like didn't pick someone like
someone needs to be picked whatever
whatever and then probably a month or
two goes by like it was a while after in
Sarah I think just texted us
individually after and was like guys
like this ELISA girl scammed us like she
took all this stuff herself really gave
it to a friend or something like she
just grabs it needs a giveaway winner
she chose was one of her friends yeah
she had her friend comment and then she
chose that winner it told us that was
the username yeah and then she kept all
the stuff for herself and we found this
out I don't know how Sarah felt like
there must have been like going to the
user and been like figured out that like
Coalition is there something she went to
the user found like the real name search
tip at when she was friends with ELISA
like crazy like good for Sarah honestly
I'm so that yeah yeah because without
her we would've been like oh like
someone got it whatever and just like
she would've like kept our money yeah
and I remember what Sarah was texting us
in the group message and she had
literally got ahold of Alyssa's mom he
was like it's like blowing everyone off
and like trying to get away with her
scam obviously and Sarah got in contact
with who mom and then ELISA had to
refund us all yeah I got refunded via
PayPal yeah Sarah was like guys don't
you worry about this like I'm gonna get
this done like I'm gonna get our money
back like follow ball and I was like
okay like thank God for Sarah because I
would have been scared and iPod easily
probably wouldn't let it go I would've
been like oh whatever like not doing it
giving people I don't know again and
also - I think which is good to know is
like we live in New York
and I'm pretty sure this ELISA girl
lived like on the west coast like we
didn't live like anywhere near that me
know what I mean yeah looking back it's
so weird it was
I was like Oh it'll be fine because you
just naturally think the best of people
but like really she scammed us and I
kept it so I would say maybe advice for
people out there like really just like
be aware of what's going on it's hard to
tell how someone is just from the
internet you know yeah that's like
because people yeah like just like you
and then are they nice to you and then
all of a sudden you're stabbed yeah and
I guess we're lucky it wasn't more money
you know because big youtubers now we're
giving away like Matt backs and like
literally what's next to call you know
bigger so it's just I think it's
important to keep in mind like you don't
really know ya anymore so basically I
guess that's pretty much it that we got
like scam ins by this girl
it's really weird thinking back like I
think a part of me was so embarrassed
that it happened I was like Gretchen
like how did you let this happen like
you're such an idiot
I don't even think my parents know
honest like I don't think I told them
because they were probably like crushing
the car you stupid like you like PayPal
this girl like 50 bucks like I didn't
even know where there's no I'm alike
none of us I guess every ways weren't
like a huge I mean they were a thing but
no one really knew like the exact rules
of how to do a club giveaway you know I
was like okay go for it
yeah but yeah yeah so it's in the past
but I'm sorry to any of you to yet like
Andrew that give what I like didn't get
anything I'm really sorry too because we
had no idea yeah like we were in on it
yeah I'm really sorry but yeah so just
be careful and that is our story of how
we got scammed by another youtuber I
guess you never really know people like
I don't know I'm gonna do a video with
Gretchen and Lucy on my channel about
the 10 things you need to know in high
school I know like a lot of you guys and
my subscribers are in high school
