my voice is still gone but I'm going to
cut in its elections prophecy tonight
and it's kind of like a dreary cloudy
day in Boston but blown-down literally
this morning I had like coral din and
like meetings and stuff my genuine blog
it is like 1 a.m. right now which sounds
insane but I'm at a B Louise says hi
puppies and me and the Lisa just filmed
a video with Kings he lives in a
beautiful building so that's really
funny and Spiro and me and Lisa did like
the stupidest thing ever with Kings and
was really dumb she should watch this
video because our lips still hurt so bad
make those look good so basically I'm
really dumb and like the new story short
yesterday I had a team meeting like down
the street from here but like not that
close like probably half a mile whatever
and in postmates that was like the
address and I delivered three Caesars
Backlund
into that apartment but we weren't there
but I realize that I didn't change
apartment yeah so then I just had to
order three new ones - this one yes
and um yeah they're just like two doors
your salads but time they look so good
guys 50 but then we don't know where
those ended up and that was fifty again
but honestly like so worth it because
Abby needs race against Michelle okay
she anything all day and he's 1245 right
I can't believe how late it is but
that's what I do for your house
basically just don't be dumb like me and
just like be cautious and careful where
you're delivering your post mates and
just yeah and go watching me at Lisa's
video games this is really high
where they banned both places she
visited again
Cory's getting really heated today
because final blood right so read final
business plans are due in one week from
today Tuesday and you guys gonna go back
to OB and take some lessons on how to
work in teams what am I like never mad
and I came in and I could just tell you
like didn't look right and I just
couldn't see him and I was like what is
wrong tell guys I just got back from
court and this is like the best day ever
and so unlike court it is now 3:25 guys
3:25 and my core classes go to like four
oh five or ten usually but today was
like a big Fe human workshop and it was
actually kind of like a bloodbath I know
I felt a tiny bit with Sascha in there
on a break but there's five teams and so
I was like three teams presented there
was a break-in in two more and when we
went last saving the best for last
obviously but now I just feel like all
the teams are getting so tense and
anxious and angry and some teams are
dividing and having issues with each
other and fighting and stuff and I'm
just so blessed and lucky that our team
it can just work really well together
because even though it's a crunch time
and our business plans are literally -
in a week like that's obviously why
everyone's freaky now and we're still
like keeping it together and going
strong and I'm just I feel so lucky for
that and if you hit tell haven't watched
my hair like four days it literally
grows so I throw it up in a ponytail
we're gonna get camo sweatshirt leggings
I can't do this like I feel like when I
get really into school like business
mode I just kind of let everything else
kind of fall behind just like my arm is
complete mess right now haven't done
during like a month probably should
watch like my sheets on my bed because I
don't want to be like a gross demon I
should probably you know like shower I'm
like on YouTube like stuff like that so
I just feel like the universe rewarded
me today and I really needed this
afternoon off to like get my life
together and catch up on just like being
a human and not having a team meeting
because I just assumed we'd meet this
afternoon and our team was like okay
guys like let's all go home or group and
we'll meet early tomorrow and just crank
out Wednesday Thursday Friday to finish
my business plan word like final stretch
but anyway I just wanted to say like
take this small I don't know opportunity
is life gives you like that just makes
me really happy I don't know I'm just
how's it person another thing I wanted
to say is now that we're having a deep
intimate talk right now over my leftover
chicken Caesar salad that we got it when
I am last night so I just wanna keep
this really like general and big because
I think it applies it to a lot of things
but I don't you guys remember that
everything happens for a reason I know
some people don't agree with that but I
really really do agree with that and I
think that like when one door closes
another one opens and like everything
happens for a reason and it might not be
apparent right away but like in a week's
time in a month's time in here's time
you might be like oh like I didn't get
this internship I didn't get this job I
whatever miss this flight like it could
be anything like that didn't happen and
like this is the reason why and yeah I
just want you guys to like have faith
that wasn't things like don't work out
the way you wanted them to like it'll be
okay and just like it's so interesting
because things are like a really big
deal like right now today something
really really upsets you today it's a
big deal tomorrow it's a big deal a week
from now it's a medium deal a year from
now
you forgot it happened and when you're
40 years old you're gonna look back at
it and
laughs that you were even upset in the
first place so I mean this doesn't apply
to everything obviously like sometimes
there's really serious important things
that happen but I don't know I just want
you to know that like whatever you're
going through know that like everyone
has problems everyone goes through the
issues like it's gonna be okay and
that's why like okay exams ring a really
good explanation and my friend sometimes
I get caught up in this we're all right
like don't worry enough about I have an
exam or homework or something but I'm
always like you know what like I'm gonna
try the best I can right now but that's
all I really can do and like literally
when I'm 40 and I'm looking back at
going to be you and like did I graduate
with a good degree yeah am I gonna
remember what grade I got in my is
midterm no am I gonna even remember the
is class that I took probably not like I
don't know so that's just kind of my
mindset about things and I always when I
get upset or something happens I always
just try to think big picture and that
usually helps me so that's just some
advice for you guys but anyway this we
really productive I'm really excited
about it I'm gonna go film a honey bun
haul video because I gotta pack into the
clothes a while ago and I've been
waiting and waiting and waiting smell
because I'm a suspect clothes no but I
like never come back home with hers
daylight but now there's still day
license 3:30 so I'm really excited film
so every watch Christmas movies have
dinner with my roommates I'm so excited
so every or never all home together okay
and we thought this would be in the
spirit right now Megan got a special
chocolate peppermint almond beverage
which happens I probably have to shake
well it Oasis gluten-free lactose-free
soy free vegan well thank goodness for
that better just say Taylor friendly on
the package it actually smells so good
he's like chocolate mint medicine I
forgot
thick creamy I'm not what you're saying
is that really
I wish you a sweeter I would add sugar
good job is yeah I shake I shoved well
two books open at once using your laptop
as a book stand they actually look so
cool way I'm like really about it yeah
they're like super dark
I don't know but still like metallic II
like well yeah let's go tell we got a
bunch of free stuff that we've been
looking through and leave put on green
like red lipstick it would be fun really
go Halloween costume eat lipstick color
wise I think this actually works better
on me than a red Oh color that you read
like the formula you like Michael Scott
right now it's all vegan for you puppy
it's actually so good everyone get cafe
472 it's really weird that they call it
tofu base because it's literally just
like soy base but tofu Oreo peanut
butter chips Oreo again and peanut
butter on top how is yours good
so provocative like sweet salacious this
is getting bleep sounded so but no one
listened to Christmas tree by lady gaga
no one listened agrees mr. Dwight like
the Kafka it's a really bad my Christmas
