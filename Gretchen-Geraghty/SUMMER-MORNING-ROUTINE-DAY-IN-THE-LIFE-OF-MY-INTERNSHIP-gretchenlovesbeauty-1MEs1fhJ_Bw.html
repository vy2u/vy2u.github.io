the title of this video this is just
going to be a day in the life of my
internship and yeah but I'm wearing
today is actually kind of different than
what I would typically wear for our
internship but today is kind of
exclusively me and Tasha filming getting
so much content as much as we can for
them we're basically gonna take photos
like all day long and a bunch of
different clothes that we ordered
there's Tasha in the back of a car this
is why I have so much makeup on too like
normally I wouldn't feel like this heavy
of makeup for our internship because
we're just like in the office chillin
with everyone but I have like the fake
eyelashes and all except for Kylie we
don't know where she is
girl are you but yeah we were just
headed to the office right now the first
thing we're going to do today is if I'm
gonna haul video with clothes we got and
like this actually really is a bad
representation of what we do every day
for an internship because basically we
have today and tomorrow and that's the
last two days of our internship or those
but we will continue to work with doe
just like a lot less than we have this
summer because obviously we'll be in
school because we love them and we'd
hate to just be like bye see you later
basically every day looks like more like
we go into the office if we're in San
Francisco of course because we've
traveled here this is like our second
week we've been here in the summer just
to like work out of the office work with
them it's a lot easier when you're like
communicating with people in person
instead of over slack and like FaceTime
you know but we did work remotely most
of the summer and Tasha was in LA and I
was in Manhattan we would just work on
like joke pic list we completely ran
their Instagram we work on Twitter we
would do like a bunch of different
content idea like strategy type stuff
but then when we're here we get to do a
lot of more like fun things because
we're here like in person like tonight
we have this like Rebecca Minkoff little
event and then we get to use they may
look a little Content room for us for
like filming using a whole bunch of
different stuff on dough and like we go
and we take photo shoots out in the
other office so anyway that's what today
is gonna look like sorry I've been
talking so much in the beginning and
yeah let's go to the office so cute it's
gonna be a perf backround variously in
Lorient and we're here really early it's
film our video will it go back in there
to have like a little brain storms and
meetings and stuff this is another
little room that we go in some
brainstorming whiteboards these are our
desk which are filled with clothes and
stuff that we got this is like everyone
else's dad
and there's a big meeting room up there
which was fun and we actually had to
meet up all right here for anyone
watching this that came to our Meetup
you remember in all of this was moved
out there was chairs we had like a
little panel table right here and then
up there was the kitchen and we had like
food and stuff up there so yeah this is
like the coolest place ever
oh we're gonna show them my outfit and
this is like the other bathroom I just
couldn't be really quick because there's
a full-length mirror because I want to
show you guys my outfit so this dress is
super old really wrinkly and I literally
just bored here because all the other
clothes that were like shooting in and
stuff we got a delivery to well wear
those and then I'm also getting a spray
tan later today and I got on the bus
before so hopefully it goes well I just
knew that I wanted one for beauty cons
I'm really pale I'm pretty sure I got
this dress from Windsor but I just need
like a loose dress you know for when I
get a spray tan like afterwards and then
these shoes I just got from Sam Edelman
I think they're like so cute if anyone
knows like these ones that like a
lace-up I thought they'd always fall
down if you don't dye them tight enough
so just like how do you do it woman OH
dane life so funny it just took us
forever to set up my camera because we
the camera is literally heavier than the
tripod that's okay our inner little back
room right now our desks are out there
like I showed but we're just back here
doing some work together and we just
posted our dota pics for the day and I'm
gonna show you guys the internal tool
with like how you do it cuz I still just
think that's like the coolest thing I
don't know why I like amazes me they're
like if you activate it online it like
shows up in a book it's really cool but
anyway today I did a movie night
playlist not playlist Oh pick and then
Tasha did the Happy Birthday Kylie don't
pick list because today is her birthday
so this is what it looks like when you
go on the internal total I put it all in
I think this could be interesting for
you guys I wasn't interested in like
social media or it's kind of like the
more like tech side back kind of things
if you go to marketing and then do oh oh
dope pics and then here's like all the
ones that we have
and there's the movie night when I made
in the Kiley line so then we just put
like the socialist ID in there you can't
see it right now but then there's the
cover image there's a little gift we
have oh my god I love modern family and
there's all the items in the list so
that's like a big part of what we do it
takes a while like things really good
Dokic ideas because we want to stay like
really famous and current and do like
trends that you guys are interested in
and then right now we're gonna go take
some pictures and our outfits that we
got for our whole video and do like all
the Tryon and such so yeah this rapper I
got from urban I think it is so cute so
close that so on our way to square right
now and we're gonna like I guess to
orange like Kate lunch happening we're
really excited it's gonna be cool and
yeah you guys are no square is I just
think it is like those receipts they the
email templates like payment processing
layouts of Squarespace and a bunch of
other stuff wanna say hi hi seriously
Newark idli and oh yes it kind of
reminds me of like when it became our
last week we were here and we went to
like Google on snapchat all that stuff
that would been fun about oh wait I did
what's the time I logged Anna go check
it out
we're gonna get paid to their badges
yeah guys it's a Miss a building is the
uber building and I'm just like excited
about that cuz it was cool can we just
like pop on over hey we're here you're
going in the building
yeah yeah this one's actually kind of
cool they designed this about the
designer Vivienne Tam for like a limited
edition you're on the first door and
you're like a white iPod swivel thing
that comes around to you we basically
invented all of that and now there's a
bunch of competitors in markets yeah a
ton of it like we're the first this is
so cool the point is like everybody when
it's like brand you're like totally this
is kind of like the coffee bar at Google
but that's where so cute Wow when
there's tea that is what I'm about we
love these cubes so guys we just left
square and it was so fun going there so
nice and we were really scared that we
weren't gonna be able to film because a
woman when we were going and was
literally like if you're gonna go in
there you can't film so I was scary and
then made her sign NDA's and I was like
oh my gosh we definitely can't film but
then girl we were with us so sweet
Heather know so nice to meet her and she
showed us around and squares look way
bigger than I thought really cool and we
got to see the library and yet
I was really good and our uber is here
updating de valet so cut back from
square quickly took some photos really
quick of Tasha in her dress and we're
just taking photos of me and my clothes
later because we just had like eight
minutes to take photos cuz now it's 2
o'clock I mean for rent upstairs cuz
we're gonna do a podcast we're gonna try
a podcast and see how that goes and I'm
really excited because I could talk all
day long about anything and I think it's
kind of like a radio show so this is
exciting
hey Bri my vlog camera with me can be a
vlog maybe in the podcast we'll see oh
podcast god I forget exist the limit
does not exist stay in the life of an
intern this isn't really usual at all
I've only gotten a spray tan once before
in my life like last winter but then I
just got one because I was like I'm so
pale for beautycon I need to look at
least like a little summary so just got
a spray tan and you probably can't tell
from my wedding but it turned out really
well and right now at Taschen art
actually we're gonna do some shopping
for the Rose I mean golf event so you
got some time on our hands and it's gone
like Fillmore Street I believe and we're
gonna go like rag-and-bone like benefit
and such an art goober is almost here so
that is what is happening oh we filmed a
podcast I think I films like one second
but we literally fun hour and a
half and it was so fun wasn't that so
fun I knew it besides it was so awesome
but malaria were right there he's
walking a mess
so everyone we're this little cafe now
cuz we came over to like Fillmore Street
where they're about to make coughing is
we just often up just look at the
eighties and fries it's called
physically Tasha and I went to dinner
twice I don't think I've filmed or like
at the Rebecca Minkoff in yeah I can't
believe this is the end in this video I
just ripped off my fake eyelashes I mean
I didn't get it at all she just posed
mated budge and it came with caramel
going so I'm eating caramel corn nut
caramel corn that was cold
yeah what are those things are you gonna
Halloween them that are triangle Oh
candy corn this is karma there is tan on
the minute you probably can't even see
huh that's for my legs oh yeah they're
literally orange oh I don't know how to
say that in Spanish no Ron ha I know
that's a orange fruit but is that the
same as an orange orange you guys should
hear me and Tasha's conversation and you
shouldn't hear them people would pay our
uber drivers are probably so entertained
or I was very disappointed with the
youth of America
one or the other I'm feeling like I was
just blogging today and I could be like
a total idiot normal but then I realized
I was trying to like set a good example
of what like a day in the life of an
internship is like but in reality we
don't have an internship like most
people like whenever explaining over
like that is like really ideal and it
really is like we're so lucky that we
get to work like who else gets to have
an internship that's paid with her best
friend and that gives travel a bunch
literally no like we're so lucky so
lucky I agree
today was really fun Rugrats okay and I
know today was like not like a typical
day but there really isn't like a
typical day for us at dope because it's
like a startup so it's so fast-paced
there's new stuff every day so you can't
really say this is like a typical day
because like it's not the same every day
it's different every day which is
another reason I love it
that is our internship Jana life have
you saw Josh's video probably very
similar to mine cuz we were together I
know I know
thank you guys so much for watching and
I'll see you next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
