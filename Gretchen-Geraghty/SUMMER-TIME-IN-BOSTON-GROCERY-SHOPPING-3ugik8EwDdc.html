like mind-blowing thing like I'm just so
like whoa right now and this is us I
don't know if this does this to you guys
if you've seen mrs. s but when I watch
it I'm like sad most of the time because
the show is just like really like
heartwarming it's all just about like
families and like family dynamics and
stuff I feel but it's like whenever I
watch it I'm like sad and I like think
so much about life because it's so much
about like relationships and like love
and like whatever but hey I just heard
me the craziest thing will you read it
again
I like I was like I have to pull my vlog
camera so she can say it because I live
I got the chills and she read it like I
have a mind look where did you find that
Instagram somebody reposted it yeah it
says here yeah well what if when we die
the way at the end of the tunnel is the
lights to another hospital room there we
are born the only reason you come out
crying is because you remember
everything from your past life and your
crying at the fact that you died and
lost everything and as you grow you
start to forget your past life and focus
on the lighting up now the patches of
memory stay behind and that memory
becomes deja vu think about that oh my
gosh like what
that's so trippy right as he said when
he died the light at that in the tunnel
is in another hospital room and you're
reborn I was like whoa and then I
thought I would like I feel like your
soul could just like transfer like you
could have been like a kitty cat in your
past life or like a dog or like Abraham
Lincoln I go Hannah I could have been
Abraham Lincoln that's so wait and you
know like things that you're like and
people would be like oh I was like a dog
in my past life or whatever like I
literally was a golden retriever like I
am a golden retriever
