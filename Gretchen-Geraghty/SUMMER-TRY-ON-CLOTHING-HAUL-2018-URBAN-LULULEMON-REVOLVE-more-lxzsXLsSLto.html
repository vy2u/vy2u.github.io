my new apartment right now if you can't
tell this is like a different background
I'm also filming on my DSLR because it
has the good mic on it so hopefully this
all works out also my air conditioner on
because it's so hot out today it's like
85 I hope you can't hear it maybe I'll
turn it off and just suffer in the heat
for the sake of this haul video hang on
alrighty so I have been getting so so
many clothes for summer and some stuff
doesn't even really make sense for
summer I got a whole bunch of jeans but
I'm the type of person that I'll still
wear like pants in the summer or like me
and Louisa went to the gym this morning
and I was saying like even though it's
so hot out like I still have to wear
leggings when I work out and like I
still really like wearing jeans in the
summer I'll just write was like a tank
top and sandals you know so that
explains like all the jeans and like so
it just in sweatpants like I don't know
I look like wearing warm clothes in this
summer if that makes sense if it's not
too hot like I love wearing like a tank
top and like joggers or like a
sweatshirt in short so that's why I got
like stuff like that and I just have
miscellaneous stuff from all over the
place that I've been running this show
for so long and I've gotten so many
clothes that I'm not even showing all
the stuff that I've recently gotten like
this cute little said I'm wearing right
now it's from Toby but I'm not gonna
show the stuff that I got from Toby in
this video I'll probably just post a
bunch of pictures and the stuff on
Instagram because I didn't get that like
too many things I got so many things
from Princess Paulie I'm literally
obsessed I'm gonna do an Instagram haul
with them and the next like day or so
maybe the day that this is up but today
I'm gonna be showing you stuff from when
I went to Burlington I got so much stuff
at Echo boutique I got stuff from Aldo
well just one pair of shoes stuff from
revolve and then a whole bunch of stuff
from Levi's so without further ado let's
jump on in okay so but first I'm gonna
show you I got four things from echo
boutique when I was in Burlington I'm
gonna start with that because I got it
like a couple of weeks ago and I visited
Hanna my first thing I got are these
shoes I think I posted with them on this
room oh yeah when I wore that hold graph
it it was like right after I got these I
got strap but yeah they're just these
dark grey Steve Madden shoes you can
tell everyone I'm a bunch of everybody
like dirty on the bottom but I am so
obsessed with these I just saw them in
the store and I was like these are sick
and they remind me so much of my big
navvy be because I don't know they're
just like really edgy cool when I finish
she would wear shoes like this so I love
those
than these I've been getting so many
questions about these have been all over
my Instagram I've literally worn them
every day like I remembered I got them I
wear them for like a week straight and
everyone's like Gretchen please change
but I'm so obsessed with these if you
guys have seen in my Instagram Oh Goldie
I discovered actually in the fall at the
same echo boutique in Burlington because
they have a Goldy items but I know they
have a Goldie and like revolve and just
a bunch of other places too and they're
just these a Goldy light medium wash
ripped like denim shorts and I'm so
obsessed with these I have like two
other skirts from the Goldy a pair of
jeans from a Goldie like they just fit
me so well and I just like always know
that I'll be like a size 27 and yeah
they fit me perfect and these are
actually like at first I was like I
don't think I like them they're like out
of my comfort zone because they're kind
of longer I know that seems crazy now
I'm hoping them up they look like pretty
short but I'm just used to you guys
probably know like like denim shorts I
feel like can be booty shorts a lot and
I'm used to like really short shorts but
these are a little bit longer and I'm
like look at you go girl 21 all mature
now with my like inch longer assurance
but um I mean just obsessed these and
literally you're gonna see them everyday
news your pictures so for all the people
that have been wondering where they're
from I found I'm at a boutique but
they're Goldy so I'm sure you can find
them on their follow very cool these
website or whatever Oh which reminds me
everything that I can find links to in
this haul video I'll link down below
because I know that's so helpful for
y'all and I haven't tried like
everything on yet but I'm going to this
isn't me trying off because I know you
guys like those the best and I don't do
try and all people get really mad so I
will be trying everything on
oh wait this I read showed going keep
continuing it from echo boutique I saw
this bag and I was like what is that I
need it and I'm so weird about bags like
I'm very like picky and particular and
like what I like and don't like and I
don't even really know what that is I
just like if I see like most bags I feel
like I don't like oh my god I wouldn't
use it if I see a bag and I love it
that's like important because I'm like
weird about bags but I saw this and I
was like I need it it's so cute and it's
from the brand day and mood and I didn't
have never heard of that but I've been
like posting whether something's
grabbing tagging them because it's from
there and I just think it's so cute and
I love it and I like how big it it's
like there's a lot of space in here like
I put my computer in here and a bunch of
other stuff in there all fit so I just
love
I get it so slouchy and like soft
leather love then ok this I'm like mad
at myself about because I literally just
tried it on to try on like the whole
outfit like take a picture in it when I
was at the boutique so this is literally
just a white t-shirt that has a little
v-neck and I was like we I don't have a
white t-shirt that has a little v-neck
so I bought it and it was way too
expensive it's by the brand Michael
stars I've never heard of that but
apparently Michael stars has some
expensive t-shirts so don't buy this
please don't buy I'm not even gonna link
this one down below because I don't want
you to waste your money and I actually
went to brandy Melville like a couple
days after and I literally got this
exact shirt button gray and I know they
have it in way too so literally go with
the white one from brandy because it's
better than this one anyway no like I
obviously liked it but it was like 65
dollars or something like ridiculous so
go get the one from brandy I'm pretty
sure it's like 15 or 20 so yeah but I
mean it's all like is it so comfy and
Cayman and whatever I live my life with
no regrets right guys oh I got so much
stuff from Lululemon sweet here they are
I worked out with them this morning so
they're loose with even gross I've been
wearing them so much I wore them to work
out in Aruba as well when I was Arlen if
you guys like saw a little peep of these
in that vlog but I just love them
they're so cute hi we said wonder
runners and I like that these have we
said 1 earners are super soft they must
feel like a lines but like a little bit
thicker because sometimes when renders I
feel it can be like the luck stream kind
and they're like more spandexy which I
like sometimes but I just like that
these ones are soft you know I'm saying
so these are soft they're like a
speckled gray color I think there's 7/8
so love these I've been waiting to show
this stuff from the loop for so long and
then I got this black sports bra I still
haven't even worn it it's the free to be
serene raw and I just got a in black to
get a 4 or 6 oh I got a 4 probably
should I'm six my boobs are a little bit
bigger now but that's okay um so looks
like that just crosses in the back I
have so many sports bras I realized but
it's okay I'm gonna work out a lot this
summer
me and Lisa started our fitness journey
this morning we're gonna work out all
the time because we want to be really
bad this summer so yeah
okay and then I got these black a new
pair of black line leggings
and I get these in a size 2 and I would
recommend it online leggins going to
size down because I'm always like a 4
and Lulu button these I get it too
because they're like super stretchy and
I like my leggings tight so let's not
get it two of these but they like
stretch out I feel like and yeah they're
perfect and I love them and there's
nothing better than a fresh new pair of
black Lululemon a lot literally okay
then so this is just one thing I got
from SoulCycle I saw that they were
having like a little sale online so how
cute is this I saw this is on sale a
size small I was like it was made for me
I need it and it's just as my own I'm
getting a huntsman because that air
conditioning is it on so everybody
started like dripping in sweat but it's
just this like neon II light orange
SoulCycle sports bra it's a Nike and I
love it and it makes you look tan and I
love it it's just so cute then okay see
that this is so like miscellaneous also
wait oh this is I got in Burlington I
showed up showed this sooner but this is
from Free People
and it's the black like iconic like tube
top thing that they have you know that
like looks like that and a bunch of my
friends have it in white and my big
Natalie actually had it in black so then
ever since I saw her wearing it I was
like I need it and I saw it I was like
this is so perfect for the summer match
tried on the only one and I feel like it
looks better on me but I love this one
so I'm so happy I got black one and okay
then from her ball I just got one thing
I ordered online because I was like
scrolling through as shopaholics do and
I saw this stripes that I thought it was
so cute so the bottom oh it's my brand
show me your movement by the way and I
got it all in a small and I kind of wish
I got the top and a medium just because
I'm like super wide like around like I
have like very broad shoulders and I
feel like the top could let go closer
together like I think it's so far apart
cuz it's kind of tight on me so it shows
like all my boobs and like I wanted to
wear it's like a family dinner the other
day and I'm like they don't want to see
my boobs during dinner you know but the
pants are like perfect they're just like
vertical gray and white stripes love
them and then this gray and way of shape
let's talk just looks like this and it
ties in the front I love the style top I
think it's so cute but again it just
kind of shows my boobs law so probably
about a medium but that's okay and then
I just got this from urban wait actually
hang on this isn't the Hebrew to because
I've been wearing it so much
oh okay from urban I ordered this
bralette because it just looked so cute
like I love this like washed blue color
but I've also been wearing this like
every single day so than this I just put
the hamper finally to get washed but
it's just this blue really stretchy
comfy bralette and I believe it's from
their line like out from under yes it is
and you guys if you guys are familiar
with that their stuff is like so just
soft and so I love this everywhere new
so much yeah and then oh this is out
from under as well and I have it in like
light gray I don't even know if I showed
that yet I think I showed that in a
whole video though because I have this
exact one in like gray and I love it so
I just got it in black and just has
really stretchy straps and the whole
thing is like stretchy and just soft and
I love it's like the perfect little
black tank top and then from Aldo I just
got these pair of shoes if you've seen
on the mainstream I'm worn this stuff
that I've gotten recently I've been
wearing like crazy so I got this one new
bear the other day when I was with
Maggie and Kyle and Michael if you guys
don't cook on Michael I love them Kyle
okay I always everybody's name stuff so
confusing okay so my friend is Maggie
why am i explaining this right now
little just like little detour real
quick
but um Maggie's boyfriend Tyler has a
brother Kyle and then Kyle's boyfriend's
Michael and Kyle and Michael started a
YouTube channel and I love their videos
and they're so cute so go out to their
videos but anyway I was with Kyle on
Michael and Maggie on Newbery and we're
just shopping eat lunch and hanging out
but I was wearing my Saint Laurent
sneakers I showed her Selena haul that
are so freakin cute but hurts so
freaking bad and they were just giving
me blisters as they do and I'm really
trying to break them in but they just
always rip apart my feet and I literally
couldn't stand it anymore and couldn't
walk so I walked into Aldo like
tiptoeing around because my heels hurt
so bad and I found these and I was like
I just need them because I need to wear
them right now but also I've been
wearing them like every day they're so
cute like I actually might just wear it
with this outfit because they're so just
like beachy and fun and you can already
tell how like or how worn in they are
because I've worn them so much but
they're just like nothing I
and they're so cute so I'll definitely
like them down below they're really cute
looking look okay wow so I think that
was everything up until Levi's
so we've everything I got from Levi's
and then book a clue the haul so I got
so much denim I guess we'll just start
with that
this I've already worn you might notice
when I went to at Bridgewater to visit
Maggie I actually wear this denim jacket
I felt so cool I feel like Lucy when I
wear denim jackets cuz she's super like
edgy and cool and like hipster vibes and
she wears these but um it's just like a
plain genom jacket from Levi's I'll have
the exact style like link down below so
you could see what one is because I know
they have so many I want to say it was
like boyfriend or ex-boyfriend or like
something like that I just got it in a
small and it's so perfect and I love
that'll be perfect for like chilly
summer night and then like I said just a
pile of denim let's start from the top
okay this is Levi's original fit 501
jeans firming straight leg button fly
but these are shorts okay in these
shorts I got in at 28 because I didn't
want them to be like too tight muffin
top you know so I just got them in at 28
I haven't tried them on yet but
hopefully they said well I feel like
they'll be like a low loose that would
be good so that's what these ones look
like and then these are also got a 28
they're like same sort of deal but they
like fold at the bottom and I have like
no denim shorts anymore so I just kind
of went in and got two pairs then I got
three pairs of jeans if you guys saw
recently did I ever show those in a hall
I don't know but basically Abby had
these high-waisted skinny jeans from
Levi's that have like two holes minis
and I loved them so much and I borrowed
them so much and so then I bought myself
a pair of them so then I realized I like
love Levi's jeans so then I got three
pairs and these are like high-waisted
ones these are like super high-waisted
my on super skinny extra high rise slim
through hip and thigh these are 27 ya
get 27 of their jeans
and these just look like medium Amish
but again I'll have them all linked down
below so you can find me exact pair cuz
they obviously have so many jeans and
Levi's these I thought would be perfect
for like nighttime summer because
they're black mile high super skinny 27
just all black and you can never have
too many
black jeans am I right sister these are
like I think okay remember the ones I
was talking about that have you had that
I had to get they are like these exact
ones but medium wash and so then I since
I love them I saw that they had them but
in dark wash so it's literally the same
they're just dark wash like that you
make holes on the knees high waisted and
really cute and ring okay then I got a
couple other things that aren't denim
and then we'll be done promise so this I
got from Levi's it's just a gray um
what's it called v-neck t-shirt and
short sleeve and I realized I didn't
have a great v-neck like if you noticed
that white where price
Michael star shirt that I got for him
echo boutique in Burlington I was like I
don't have a white t-shirt and then I
went to bring him a little and I was
like oh my gosh I don't have any gray
but it's like a lighter gray and it's
like crop oh my gosh I get my battery
died it's about to die again because I
don't wait George it for a second but
all I was saying was this was longer
than the Brandis shirt that I got so
this is why I like this one okay three
more things whom you guys then we're
done I got two sweatshirts this one was
actually on sale in the men's section I
was like how can I not get it it's so
cute I always look in clearance and that
always look like in the men's section
because sometimes a really comfy cute
stuff and I just thought this blue color
was like beautiful obviously I like love
blue I don't know just blues really
pretty and this is just a small and it's
super big and cozy and I love and like I
said I love blue so this one I just
thought was super cute as well like in
the summer with some like ripped shorts
and it just says Levi's and it's like
baby blue and it's like a hoodie and the
reason I got this I think is because you
guys know my friend Emma McDonald has
like a light blue hoodie like this but
it says baby girl and I just always
thought it was so cute ever since she
wore it so I love this and it reminds me
of that and the very last thing I got
less but certainly not least are they
using grey like sweat pant joggers and
I'm so obsessed with like
athleisure and just like joggers like so
hands down because it can be soaks up
well what that wasn't English you can be
so comfy and cute like at the same time
so there just needs like gray
sweatpants and I love them and you'll be
seeing all these Oliver ends it's you
why am i having troubles being English
right now okay so that was everything
again don't forget I will have
everything linked down below that I can
find and yeah thank you so much for
