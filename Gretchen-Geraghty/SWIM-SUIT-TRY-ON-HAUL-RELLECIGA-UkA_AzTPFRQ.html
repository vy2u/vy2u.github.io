haul video for you guys and I'm so
excited to share this video with you
guys because I'm obsessed with some
suits I'm actually about to go to my
lifeguard job right now and I'm going to
be wearing one of these so I just got
these bathing suits online from Arella
sigue bikini and I don't even know if
they have like an in-store store because
this is the first time I've gotten stuff
from them online but some other
swimsuits are seriously so cute in the
ones I got I'm obsessed with and I
couldn't wait to show it like another
haul video with a bunch of other stuff
so I'm just showing them all by
themselves and I know some of you guys
like shorter haul videos anyway so I
thought that would be good and I just
have three bikinis to show you and let's
just get on into it so the first bikini
I have to show you is definitely my
favorite by far and it's just this
floral print one it has like a yellow
background with some red and pink and
blue flowers in the bottoms just look
like this
I actually just wore this one and like
Georgia's past weekend and Justin said
he liked it I got a lot of compliments
and I just think it's so pretty and I
love also too the roughly details around
the side I also like that it's like
bruised up the but I don't know I just
like bathing suit bottoms like that I
think they're really flattering that's
definitely my favorite bikini out of all
three of them but these definitely my
favorite bottoms and this is just a
plain black bathing suit in the top just
looks like this it is kind of push up
which is nice because I have zero boobs
as you can tell by this like try on like
I literally have no boobs but this does
have a little push up so it helps a
little bit in that area and I also love
how as the crisscross detailing in the
middle I just think that's so beautiful
it makes it so different and unique and
I have no beading to top like this and
just ties around the top like a little
halter simple black top and the reason I
really love this bathing suit is because
of the bottoms they're all black but I
love how it has cutouts right there on
the sides I just think it makes it look
so different and unique and really cute
so I really really like that one and in
the last meeting sue I have to show you
is just this kind of red in blue and
white printed one I thought this was so
different different than what I had and
I thought it was very patriotic like I
could wear for fourth of July or
something because it just has this blue
and white like bird print I guess and
then there's like red lace on the top
and I love like all the strappy
detailing right here on the top and also
on the bottom I just love how it has all
those straps I think it looks so cool
and all
I got all of these in a small except I
don't know why these ones fit a lot
tighter than these ones and these ones
like these to fit like a small and these
fit like an extra small extra extra
small they're just I don't know if you
can see a little there they're like
really tight around but like I don't
care it's like stretchy so it's barn so
if that's why it looks tight when I'm
trying it on but I still really like it
and it's funny as Justin was telling me
he's like the bird print reminds me of a
cross between like Hollister and like
American Eagle because you know they
have like the bird-like logo for their
store so I just think this is really
cute too and like I said so different
than what I had and all these bathing
suits from elysee go will be linked down
below so you guys can check them out if
you're interested because you guys know
I'm like obsessed with bathing suits
like I literally have so many triangle
and Victoria Secret ones but I tried to
branch out and get kind of different
looking ones that I do normally have in
those I think you're so cute like I said
I'm about to go to lifeguard right now
and I'm gonna wear this one because
luckily my lifeguarding job allows me to
wear bikinis and so you guys know - like
I'm so obsessed with bathing suits but
they all have a use because I do
lifeguard so I'm allowed to wear bikinis
so I wear them all the time I wear like
all the bathing suits I have even though
