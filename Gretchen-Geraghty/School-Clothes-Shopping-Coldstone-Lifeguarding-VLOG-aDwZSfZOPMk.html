explained it before but they're my dad's
best friend Rob's daughters and like I
said before at Gabby's going into ninth
grade and Marissa's going to seventh
grade and they were at Catholic school
before so they were getting a lot of
clothes that they can run a public
school that they couldn't have worn
before until the Catholic school and
there's so much fun being able to shop
with them and help them pick out clothes
and also - it's crazy is just shopping
with them and seeing how big they've
grown up look I seriously sound like a
mom but since Lucy and I like grew up
with them it's crazy how time flies and
I know I'll miss them when we go to
which two and in that last little clip
when we dropped them off back at their
house we went on their golf cart and
