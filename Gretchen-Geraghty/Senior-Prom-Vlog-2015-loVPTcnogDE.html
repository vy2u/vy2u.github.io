beginning of my senior prom vlog it is
actually May 14th right now is a day
before prom which is tomorrow and I
honestly cannot believe that my senior
prom is tomorrow okay is going to be the
last prom I ever go to I thought it
would just be fun to start vlogging
tonight and I just tweeted out like
would you guys like to see his senior
prom vlog and a lot of you said yes he
would I actually have like lots of
makeup on right now because my senior
class just went to senior Awards tonight
I tried doing the eyeshadow and I did
like a piece of tape right there and it
made it like more dramatic looking and I
think I'm gonna do something like this
for tomorrow for prom because I'm
getting my hair done but I'm doing my
makeup because I'm GLP I should be able
to do my own makeup and like I kind of
don't really trust anyone else doing my
makeup because I'm kind of particular in
the way I like it we have senior picnic
during the day and then Lucy and I have
to leave early because we have to go get
our hair done my dress is actually right
here it is like aqua turquoise with
silver sparkles were there and if you
remember from junior prom
I'd like a pinkish purple dress with
silver sparkles on the top so it's like
a very similar style because I realize
I'm like specific and what I like right
here we have my Yoona suit and getting
into that I actually have a race this
weekend it is in Lowell Massachusetts so
it's pretty far from where I live and so
Lucy and I have to leave really early
Saturday morning for our race so a lot
of people do fun stuff after prom and
will like go to like houses with like a
bunch of cakes and stuff but Lucy and I
can't we actually have to come home
right after prom which is like I'm sad
but careers really important to us I
have to literally bit like 5 a.m. to
wear that cute little thing and Rowin
some boats I actually went to go get a
pedicure yesterday with Amelia and Lucy
and I was like I'm gonna get red
toenails and I got red toenails and then
I was like I hate them like after I got
them done I was like this is like dark
red it is not gonna look good with my
green dress I'm gonna like a Christmas
freak so I was like I'm sorry please
don't hate me but I hate my toenails and
I'm gonna take them off and paint them
purple so oops I actually think I put a
snapchat story of it so if you don't
want me on snapchat you totally should
you could add me it's Gretchen with five
ends so total Academy on snapchat
because I always like put up stories
like my outfit right now it's very cuz
you all at senior Awards
I wore this pink dress it's an outfit of
the week that will go up cuz I featured
it in there so you'll see that and I
actually have to go pluck my eyebrows
right now because you're going crazy
like I said with my makeup I'm just kind
of picky so I just like do them myself
hi I'm gonna go wash of all this makeup
it's gonna be a shock I'm look really
different without Oh dis makeup on line
hey do you like my nails guess what
they're actually my real nails they're
actually and C which is just like this
thick polish that they put on top of
your real nails so my real nails just
got like really long and if you saw my
tweet I actually went to school today
late because I slept in and I only saved
for two periods because I started to
feel really like nauseous and I came
home I just went back to bed and I've
been sleeping so much these past few
days I don't know what it was like I
just have not been feeling well and I
started your lace dress
so the tomorrow senior problem like I
have to be okay for some your problem
which I'll be okay I'll pull through I
know it oh my gosh
and also missing your awards night we
got our senior year books and I was
looking at them and there's this picture
from a junior prom
it's a Danny Lucy Justin and I in like
the limo we were in and secures picture
ever and I've never even seen a horse
all inserted right here because I
thought it was like the cutest thing
ever going to it like a country club
that's nearby with a bunch of our other
friends and there's little we can be
like 22 people they're like 11 couples
so it's gonna be really fun to take
pictures of all those people I'm gonna
do a prom getting ready with me like I
did last year cuz that video was really
fun to do
yeah oh wow back muscles it was you so
strong and me appreciate the fact I got
one pick for prom of course right and I
forehead
I've been taking such care of my skin
should be good for prom look at how some
scarring right along my cheeks
everything because I've had look good
back me in the past but it will be
covered up with makeup
see off-key got some loves teeth it's oh
my gosh 12:39 I had to get up early and
shower or go to bed uh
and I keep donning
I'll see you in the morning where isin
prom everyone sorry I have a morning
voice my voice is always really scratchy
in the morning it's like this
I gotta go shower and get ready but not
too ready because when you get your hair
done they want you to just have your
hair washed but you not supposed to do
anything to it because and that messes
up what they're gonna do it looks like
it's gonna be a nice day out I am
excited Lucy and I are getting our hair
done really early like twelve in one but
that's just because when you could do it
then we're just gonna come in after and
like you do our own makeup and you know
it's good that it's early because it
takes me a while to do my makeup and get
all my crap together I'm gonna go shower
right now
ready break ready go in such a struggle
to cover morning I set my alarm for 8
o'clock and is now 8 11 a.m. so getting
my day started early since today's
Friday I'm a 15th they give the seniors
the day off and we get to go have a
picnic nearby which is really nice
because they know like most people I
don't think would come to support
anyways and it's prom prom is at 7
o'clock tonight two hours we could can't
hide it then
hey my hair actually has grown a lot
recently last year I've years remember I
caught up to here
at the beginning of March now it's May
of the next year my hair is going out
and that's always good and I was almost
thinking yesterday maybe I should just
let my hair down for prom but like I
feel like you don't get to wear your
hair up like fancy too often so I'm
going to do up and every morning I have
to like a here look like a
about to commit
so use your bathroom whoa wake up you're
up you always say I know so we're off to
the senior picnic and I'm wearing these
sandals from Abercrombie which I love
I'm super excited for our little picnic
I feel around this holy brandy melville
sweater and I didn't want to put on like
makeup really because I wanted to be
able to do my makeup later after I get
my hair done this is my long-term bag
