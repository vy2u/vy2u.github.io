occurred me to vlog today and it is
currently 932 on Thursday during my
spring break which is like the first
week in April so whenever you're seeing
this right now I just thought I would
vlog today because Lucy and I have some
errands to run and our cousin Mandy is
coming tonight so she can be in this
cute little vlog and yeah I don't know
nothing too too exciting planned but
Mandy's coming so that's really exciting
I just got home from morning practice
for roaming because we have practiced 7
to 9 and 4 to 6:30 p.m. every day during
spring break so double sessions really
like wear me out and everything and this
little roller comes in handy especially
because my legs are so sore I actually
just scarf down some oatmeal and we'll
be in my what I eat in a day video which

in a day video cuz I'm excited I have
some nice little pears and um what are
those blackberries and I had to get
myself some hot chocolate too because
it's literally so cold like it's spring
break but it's not here in New York
because it's so freakin cold and being
on the water at 7:00 in the morning it's
below freezing

go to the dentist and some of you may or
may not know but I think I want to go
look into dentistry when I get older so
yeah I'm like really into teeth and
everything I literally lost like every
single night so I'm excited to go to the
dentist and for them to be like your
teeth are very clean and healthy you
know whoa but yeah Lucy and I have
someone Aaron's trying we have some
snacks together and Mandy comes to eat
really yummy food with me I guess
yeah but I'm gonna go upstairs and try
to get warm because I still can like
barely move my hands oh look there's
blisters go crew hashtag crew probs

ridiculous I was like blowin in the wind
so no it's all
yeah Hannah's coming home to him so
excited I miss her too bit and I will
probably see her too Janna and Lucien
are and Mandy you're gonna go get ice
cream so I can vlog that because we
literally have to get I shouldn't like
every school night I'm not kidding we
have to get our ice cream vics and if
Lucy and I don't get ice cream we just
eat ice cream at home like we have the
ice cream everyday it's so bad so much
to do so little time I feel like an
adult these little Aggies are so
dangerous though it's a Cadbury like
mini eggs and they taste like the best
chocolate ever I mean ever I walk far by
this pool I just always have to eat some
don't even look at this picture it's my
dog my mom my dad as you have a photo
shoot for Easter it says Easter
greetings little model I think you've
been in quite a number of my youtube
videos some people like you they're like
how is he so big and I put a picture on
Instagram with you the other day I just
feeling the love aren't you baby Oh
little puppy I always call him puppy but
like clearly he's not a puppy he's like
160 pounds of man did you just catch a
fly I think you should be my dog
tomorrow's king yes I know I can show
you this is the best almond butter ever
I actually forgot to put it my own meals
today but sometimes I put it in my
oatmeal and it taste so yummy yum yum
yum guys hope I can't stop I'm addicted
to those little eggs
we're so delicious look at my hair's all
crinkly cuz it got like wet and rainy
and that's drying funny and I look like
such a massive sniffling let's go see
what Lucy's up to good girl that's what
I need to do I'm gonna walk today
decided I need to do that oh my eyes are
so tight what's it called right there
your quad my quads my quads are tired I
took down my hair now it's all crazy and
like curly and like puffy but I wanted
to let you guys on inside secret
something you may not know about me is
that I'm always cold like I'm always
freezing don't know why I'm always cold
and not only that but like I just hate
being cold I'd rather be like sweating
like I honestly don't even mind if I'm
like dripping in sweat like that Sun so
good but I'd much rather be like really
hot than really cold and so every day I
come home I just sit in front of this
nice little heater I have and I just
like sick curled up in a little ball in
front of this heater and I'm so toasty
warm it makes me not so cold so that's
what I always do or any of you like that
that you'd rather be hot than cold cuz I
feel like a lot of people would rather
be cold than hot but like summer is like
where it's at for me and I just would
always rather be hot so would you guys
rather be hot or cold let me know down
below because I'm curious why don't you
something cool I finally bought oakley's
the other day cuz I really wanted them
really bad and want to see what they
look like I'm so excited it took me
forever to finally pick out the pair I
wanted I had to like look through every
single one and try I'm like literally
all of them but I found that I really
just got them for rowing because I
needed a good pair of like rowing
sunglasses when it's like really sunny
when you were so used to just roll with
these kind of like crappy polarized ones
and I like broke them all awesome or
something but I knew I really would need
it like polarized ones for like glare on
the water and everything like it makes a
really big difference so let's look at
the ones I got they look like this
they're black and there's like so many
different names there's like radar radar
lock and to like all these different
ones sorry this is like boring if you
like don't even get but I don't know
it's like interesting to me and these
ones are flak 2.0 I guess I got these
new ones called 2.0 and there's like
more rubbery and they go like farther
around my crap
around your head which I like because
it's like stays on when you're moving
around when you're rowing and then I got
the big lenses because I like them
bigger so these are like Excel or
something and they're just they're like
polarized black ones but the flacc 2.0
didn't come with polarized lenses so I
actually had to buy the frame itself and
then just the polarized lenses but it
like worked out they're quite an
investment because oakley's are kind of
expensive but like they're gonna last me
a while and look really fresh when I'm
racing no just kidding but they're
actually like very useful and necessary
and I've actually been sitting down seat
in the boat and my pair partner Ashley
who's to seat actually had black
Oakley's and inspired me and made me
want to get black oh please so shout out
Ashley now we're gonna be twins and
killing it in bow pair yeah okay I'm
gonna make like a separate rowing video
because people always like ask me about
it more and everything and I don't
really know how I want to like set it up
yet but I know I'm gonna be making with
another rowing video maybe like rowing
question and answer or like I don't know
I'm just like talking about it I've
moved around a lot in the book when I
first started out I was like 5c for a
while then I was like seven seat and
then this past season in the fall and in
the spring I'll probably say baozi but
yeah I never used to robe out and so it
was weird like going into it at first
but I literally love bow now it's like
my home and I love it best thing about
bow for all you Rovers out there is that
if your bow you actually cross the
finish line first so that's always fun
yeah sorry I'm like boring you I guess
I'll just talk to you before after my
dentist appointment later and tell you
how fresh and clean my teeth were
excited look there's so noise they're
gonna love them I know it
oh it's so toasty mm-hmm
so we're Badgley for them in just now
and naturally I'm eating candy on the
way
Mamun gonna be late for the jive - and
look at our egg noon foundation stuff
cuz I wanted like a new makeup just to
like wear in my face I want to try new
stuff um so I got these two like
foundations from Bobby Brown that I kind
of used both of them you'll see I think
I'm gonna do like an everyday makeup
routine with them and I'll probably show
them in a haul soon so you can see more
about that but yeah what do you think I
like it so far
I'm done easy to apply like it so yeah
there she is
so what are you looking at peanut butter
half-baked she's looking at all the Ben
&amp;amp; Jerry's did you have no comedies no me
neither
go girls except I have to get a cap on
my room now we came home from practicing
Mimi the dirt cake and we were gonna
make it give it to him
YUM because that happened before like in
touch when we vlog - we bought it wow
we're getting some good kale and grapes
to make our salad some brownie mix ice
cream tostito chips yeah
oh my gosh Oreo ice cream cake that
looks delicious
all right people are looking well guys I
just walked for like five minutes and
then realized I did it the whole time
but you missed cutie Lu reading out of
her new book that she got which is
called boys in the boat and because we
decided this year for our senior year
like you're supposed to have senioritis
so we wanted to find books to read to do
like fun things other than doing our
schoolwork and clearly so yeah what are
the three books you got your a Looking
for Alaska The Four Agreements which was
like about like something I keep showing
my girls blisters sorry
do we like my foundation looks now that
you can actually see in the light yeah I
put on my Bobbi Brown foundation I'm
gonna show them in a haul video and like
an everyday makeup routine video
oh my sweats whole your sweatpants right
now quickly oh ho Lucy got Nike
sweatpants and they're like so comfy and
huge Thurman's medium yeah we're like
waiting right now because I'm meeting
Justin at Panera and Lucy's gonna drive
home and um it's just got seeing how
many times we've gone to Panera in the
past like week you've gone like three
times but it's because I've been
recently obsessed with their chicken
noodle soup I like discovered it and
then it's like so good so I will
probably get that maybe a chicken Caesar
salad cuz we all know that's like my
favorite food ever maybe maybe not
depending on like the mood I'm in and
Lucy's just gonna
so far I like this foundation but look
it because it's making my face kind of
oily like we have the heat blastic right
now cuz we like it really hot but my
skin gets oily kind of quickly because
this isn't gonna make sense but my skin
is dry so it gets oily because it's a
producing oil so right now it's looking
kind of oily and usually I try to find
foundations that don't make it so
morally but it's looking at all greasy
but whatever so yeah I'm gonna go to
Panera now and get me food with jaybo
maybe just a name Panera Oh sneaky and
he actually told me recently that he
would like be in a video with me and I
got so excited but apparently he was not
really sure that he wanted to be and he
was still considering so oh yeah he just
texted me he's here gotta go hi darling

got mac and cheese - that's like a
really big bowl
