feel like I haven't sat down and filmed
like a video like this and so on and if
you're wondering this is like a weird
side crunch Dover to talk to you I don't
know where my tripod is I literally
looked everywhere and so you're chilling
on my pillow pet with me and we're just
chilling in my bed and I actually
remembered not too long ago I did a haul
video of just so much stuff that I
bought over the past a couple weeks and
you guys really like to in you're like I
really like seeing like what you buy
instead of like what brigham send to you
or just like I don't know stuff like
that so this is like stuff that I got
and I want to show you and it yeah over
the past month some stuff I got like for
Coachella and I'm already Coachella but
I just wanna like formally sit down and
show you and I literally have class in
like 25 minutes so I like gotta get
going and please don't hate me but we're
liking finals here now at bu and I
remember I tried out once before to
doing a haul video without Tryon just to
see like how it went and people were
really mad and we're like we just want
to see you wearing it on but I really
don't have time to like try this on it's
not like too much clothes like some of
it it's like shoes and other stuff
you'll see but I'm gonna try to insert
like the models wearing it just you can
see what it looks like on and maybe some
of the stuff I pictures in I can show
you but I'm really sorry that it's not
gonna be try and please don't eat me
like I just really wanted to film this
and like get it up because I know I've
been doing so many vlogs and I wanted to
show you stuff that I've been getting to
and just sit down and chat and have a
little haul um so I just decided that I
would make it not try and so that it's
easier for me is it okay okay great okay
cool I'm happy on the same page moving
on also um I'm just really stressed I
have a psych exam at 8 a.m. tomorrow so
I'm gonna be studying all day I have a
presentation in my 69 tonight just
whatever and so I decided that I
wouldn't wear makeup today is it okay
okay cool thanks thanks for
understanding me so first thing I'm
going to show you is okay let's just -
LF because I got this stuff a while ago
um I just like never formally showed it
I don't think I hope I didn't wow if I
showed this in a haul video I'm really
sorry I didn't I'm embarrassed but I
don't think I did so this white top is
obviously crazy and super like out of my
comfort zone but I got it to wear
Coachella and actually didn't end up
wearing it I Coachella they had so many
clothes first that I ended up like
finding clothes that they hadn't wearing
them but this I know I'll find something
cool to wear it to you like it's still
really awesome in white in cage and
long-sleeve and cropped
and can I be like super honest this
stuff I love from LF but truly I do not
think I'll be buying stuff from Elif
again if it's not during their sale and
I'm like kind of punching myself and mad
at myself that I bought this like not
during their sale because when it's not
LF sale thir stuff is so overpriced and
like crazy expensive and like their
stuff is cute but just like we're being
real here you know so yeah just like
word of advice don't go in if it's not
the sale because you're gonna follow my
with stuff and the employees will like
push you to buy things they have quite
pushy employees sometimes but they're
really helpful they helped me find cute
stuff that I like but yeah I would say
going during the sale because if not
you're gonna like buy insanely expensive
jeans that you love but like just wait
till he goes oh dude I'm saying okay
cool so I got these boyfriend jeans that
are so cute like the one of the girls
that was working there was wearing them
and I'm like I need those jeans but
obviously they're like a million dollars
but they're so cute like I'm not that
mad because I really like them and they
told me that I needed to buy them and I
was like I don't know and she's like
literally text me if you don't wear them
but I know you're gonna wear them and I
have worn them so it was good there by
the brand car Mar I feel like that's an
ALICE brand or like that brain's always
there also I'm trying to mad because I
think I got 27 or 28 I don't know where
the tag is but um normally I'm like a 27
or 26 but I think I got a 27 or 28 and I
wish that I went to size down because
they're like really loose but I think
boyfriend jeans are supposed to be loose
whatever you get me so I think these are
really cool you should probably like try
them on oh the girl that worked there -
she was like salve Montana was that her
name I think I followed an Instagram
she's like so pretty but she was like
she just posted an Instagram in these
and so like you need them or whatever
and I was like okay cool so those are
cool jeans I really like them and then
these I actually wore day one of
Coachella so these are like so worth it
and I think these are literally the cool
shorts ever I saw them and I was like I
need those and she said that they're all
like vintage like none of them actually
even have a size anywhere on them she's
like literally just gave me a handful
and was like try them on and they're so
adjustable and don't have sizes because
they like lace up on the side like this
and like like I said they're just like
vintage I think like handmade or
whatever so I just think they're really
cool and I just found like the darkest
ones I could find they're just like dark
black and they're really cool and
awesome and I love them and then these I
actually don't think about I don't think
I like formally showing like a whole
video
that's why I just want to show you right
now because we're like hauling some
things and these I got in the past
couple of weeks and they are the Saint
Laurent I don't know if they're called
but just like white sneakers and I
literally got them because my big madly
has them so love you Natalie like so I
totally copied you because when we were
in spring break in Florida she was in
Miami and me and Abby and Lisa we're in
Jupiter and then she came and visit us
in Jupiter for a couple days and I
remember the day she showed up do you
guys know that Free People
band oh um like bodysuit or like just
team top type thing that look everyone
has and it's like strapless and it has
like the cool just like crochet lace
kind of design on it I'm probably making
no sense right now and most people have
it in white I never actually saw in
black but she had it in black and she
looked so fab and she was wearing like
high-waisted black like Levi's and she
was so tan and was wearing these shoes
and I was like you look so cool like I
want that outfit so hey these these kind
of go with like the but she's my big sis
I'm allowed to copy my big sis okay so
yeah I literally got these because of
her and I like thought about it for
awhile because obviously they're like
quite expensive and a hefty price tag
but I think they're so cool and they're
so like nothing that I ever have had
that I was like it's worth it and then I
thought about it for so long and then
finally I got them on Neiman Marcus in
the last sighs wasn't in half like they
literally was like one left eight and a
half and I'm like okay obviously I was
meant to because I'm an eight in half so
I love them I just think they're so cool
they just say love and they had little
sequins and they're just like I don't
know really cool like I just think
they're so fun they do hurt really bad I
have so many like blisters and cuts and
stuff and that's that in the beginning
like they're literally like rocks like I
feel like I'm in ski boots are just so
stiff because you're like nice shoes but
you have to like break them in and
whatever but yeah they're really cool I
don't know if I could find the links to
link them down below because literally
it was like the last player in human
Marcus and I just think they're like an
older style so I don't know if they're
sold anymore but I'll try to look for
you guys I'm gonna try to link as much
stuff as I can down below for y'all and
then okay let's do actually wait let's
do great band it you guys know I
freaking love great band it and I got
stuff in them before but then
I got three more things recently and the
first thing I wore yesterday my senior
brunch and I'm so obsessed with it I
remember singing out on our website and
being like I just love this little
two-piece little getup and it like ties
in the back and then these shorts
actually I don't know if these shorts
was a tie in the front of the back but I
just taught him in the front I just
thought they looked cute and it's so
cute together I got a size medium and it
just fits me perfect um what was I gonna
say oh yeah when I saw in the website I
was like I don't know if I'm gonna wear
like lime-green it's like a light to
lime-green I would say um but then I'm
like you know what let's get out of my
comfort zone and try it and I love it
and so many people gave me compliments
on it yesterday so I love it and I think
it's so cute and hopefully it's on the
website so I can then you down below and
I actually got two other things from
grey bandit but I just couldn't find
that when I was looking for them for
this stuff in the haul video that's I
need to start doing halls like right as
I get things like I remember when I
first started youtube I would literally
get home from forever 21 and be so
excited and like have a little bag with
me and be like today and to show you
like all the stuff in the bag right is I
got it but like I feel like I get older
I don't shop like as much just like
little things over time so then I do
like a more collective haul but then I
like forget about things that I bought
it and I can't find them wow I'm like
really chatty today aren't I uh it's
other things I got from Greg bandit I
got a black um what's it called jean
jacket that was kind of like frayed on
the bottom like button-up and it's
really cute it's actually longer because
I already have one that's kind of like
that from Brandi but it's more cropped
and then this one's like longer so yeah
I can wear it like a full length jacket
and not like cropped um but I don't know
where it is I was just looking for it
and I don't know where it is and also
the snakeskin skirt I actually think is
intelligent somewhere but I was not just
like dig through her stuff because I
think she worked the other day um but I
also got the snakeskin that skirts from
gray banjo I actually posted on
Instagram um if you guys saw from great
brand it also if you don't vote me in
each video please follow me I'm so close
to 100 K on there and that's just to
like make my life and I just love
Instagram so much that that would just
mean a lot to me so well me on Instagram
I'm Gretchen Garrity yeah basically I
post them Instagram with my like
snakeskin little print skirt and so many
my friends on YouTube have it I know
danielle has it I think Marco has like a
bunch of people but it's literally the
cutest girl ever look out so recommend
it and I know I also got a size medium
because I kind of like a bigger like
button like thighs I would say and waist
- I don't know
if you earn I don't really know where
this is going look I feel like in top
snowman like a small but then if I get
like a skirt I'm gonna get a medium and
you don't want to skirt to like be so
tight and like a muffin top type you
know I'm saying whatever just know that
I'm a medium if you know like we're the
same size whatever um and I think Taylor
Ward the other day so that's why I was
just saying that I've just talked about
that skirt forever so that is what I got
from gray bandit and then the other day
I went shopping I got a thing for him a
thing a smudge it I'm brandy melville in
this top from urban and Thank You
Arianna you helped me find this because
I was like oh my gosh I've been looking
for this top forever but I can't find
the one with the skinny straps like I
see this pile of wines but they have the
thick straps and she's like Gretchen the
skinny strap one he's like right over
there and hang her and I'm like thank
you look I never saw it but I've been
wanting this for so long because I think
Maggie and Emma have it and it was just
like really cute when time we were in
the airport and I looked really cute and
so I saw it and I was like yeah and I
think it was like super affordable it
was 18 bucks and it's like super
stretchy and soft and nice so I really
like this from urban and I will link you
down below for you guys and this I'm
embarrassed to show you I've worn it for
like two weeks straight and I've gotten
so many compliments on it like I don't
know why I just like this really light
yellow sweatshirt from brandy melville
and it says sinked bar bars Barts I was
sort of Saint Barts but it says BA R th

something really weird but I've always
wanted to eat like yellow sweatshirt so
yeah okay let's move on to revolve
wait a minute there's two things in here
that I don't even know where they are
mmm okay it's okay that because I took
pictures in them so there
first thing I got from revolt is this
black halter dress with like lace right
here and I just pretend like I'm holding
up right now because here's a picture of
me and it's at our formal so cute oh and
by the way if you're wondering that
picture on my Instagram it's me and my
friend Nikki some people were like oh my
god it's your new mans are like Arlen
was like handsome like no like he's
actually I just love the kid he's like a
really good friend um yeah he's like
roommates with ha she plays soccer Sasha
anyway that is Nikki and I just posted
that picture cuz I was like we just like
so fun and happy and whatever that is
all single Pringle over here still just
you know um okay and then I got this
navy blue dress it's like long and it's
like I'll open in the back and how's it
going up the side and I don't have it
with me right now
because I got it and my grand big ariana
I love you Ariana I want her to keep it
I got it but like she needs to keep that
dress because it looks so good on here
here's a good picture of it on the model
and like the picture on her like it's
just so hard and she's so good on it I'm
so happy that she walked to our formal
because it just looked so good on it so
yeah I don't know I just feel like it's
like that like cool vibe of like I don't
know I feel like you I don't have to
have like big boobs to like fill it out
and then just like hey whatever it
looked so good on her that's that and
then I got to other things because I was
just like scrambling for a formal and I
didn't know what to wear so we got this
Mandy actually picked it out
I like texted me and a bunch of my
friends like Hello and they like figure
out things
Addie picked this one out - so - Mandy
and they just buy the brand by the way
and it's just like this pinky nude color
I would say it goes up high it's so cute
I actually saw we had our formal Friday
and then we had Pike formal all weekend
in Vermont at like Maureen if you guys
saw I was posting pictures and um
this dress I think it's really cool cuz
I'll open in the back of it just has
these like tiny little straps on the
side and I saw a girl might already
actually she had like a like this button
light blue for like Pike formal in
Vermont and it was just so cute so I
love this dress it's so cute but I'll
just find something else where - and
this I know I'll wear during the summer
oh but beware I don't know if I'm stupid
and I didn't like look at the color but
this is straight-up like light yellow
and I think online I thought that it was
cream like I got it like thinking that
it was cream but it is wet yellow this
is by the brand by the way oh this I got
a small this dress I know I got a small
the black one but I first talked about
that I
small and in that bloom in a small I
don't know I feel like I'm revolving I'm
just abilities are small and yeah it's
just like these cute little shorts and
they're so like roughly and flowy and
cute and then it goes with this yellow
top I love in it like crosses in the
back in like ties okay last but not
least yeah hey we're finishing up okay
the rest of stuff I'll be showing you is
from Kenneth Cole and I'm so excited oh
my god my memory cards right now hang on
okay I'd lose some footage we're back in
business we have some room on the memory
card so I was gonna say everything I'm
gonna be showing you the rest of things
is from Kenneth Cole I know if you use
the code it take 20 you can get 20% off
of their whole website I believe it
through May 15th I checked and yeah I
just go for it
and I'll show you probably like Kenneth
Cole what that's like random but I was
just like looking on there honestly for
like suitcases
and then I got sidetracked and found out
other things other things like you know
when you go in at Target I mean he's
like I don't know hair ties and you walk
out with like carts of stuff that's what
happened to me because basically they
just had like a pretty big sale going on
when I got them I got these like
suitcases on sale so first this is so
funny I'm so you shiny suitcases but I
was just in the need of like some good
like heavy-duty hard suitcases cuz you
guys know I'm like constantly traveling
so I got this like little carry-on just
black plane suitcase and he's like
initially we're like pretty expensive
but again like you can use take 20 for
20 percent off and I always have like
offers I feel like running on their
thing ya know why this is 200 which is
insane like why is luggage so dang it's
been said can you please let me know but
um yeah like I just really need a good
baggage so it was like worth it and I
got them for a pretty good price and
then I got the big boy this one's so big
that's the other one was like the little
carry-on size this is a 28 inch renegade
in case your honor I think this is like
the renegade question it's like the hard
one again and normally I think it's like
300 oh my God why are suitcases so
expensive but um yeah you can obviously
use like the discount code to give you
and like there's usually other offers I
feel like so it's like worth it and I
feel like that's just something that you
like me you know what I mean like if
you're always traveling like you need a
good 2 K so that's that and then I got
really sad
and done all these shoes like I was just
going in like you ever go on a website
online and you're like online shopping
but then you have to look at like every
single category to make sure you're not
missing out I'm so weird
okay these you can tell are like dirty I
got okay I think I got all of these two
weeks ago I have worn these every single
day all my friends are like do you like
wear other shoes now I've literally won
these everyday they're so comfy and
normally like with new shoes like these
oh my god they ripped my feet apart but
these are so comfortable they're the
Kenneth Cole they say New York I don't
know if that's like their full name
eight and a half I don't know what
they're called dang it but like you can
just tell by like how holding them up
like what style they are and they have
this like little gold stripe in the back
I just like that they're so low-rise and
like clean-cut and like white it's like
overexposed I feel like this is so
bright like you can't even see like the
details right now
I'm sitting in front of a window maybe
that's why but um so cute I really love
them I've been writing every day I'm
about to put them on with these leggings
and just this great thing and hop off to
class so yeah I'm literally about to put
these on right now yeah okay then these
I thought were just so cool and just
like really awesome and I actually got
them like I will wear them but um I got
them for like Lucy like tell me these
aren't like Lucy's five guys like you
know I'm saying they were just like
black sneakers I didn't know the same as
those other ones but they have like red
and then like the same gold stripe on
the back and they're just like the same
really comfy like style and then
actually with the white ones I remember
maybe I'm making this up and I think
like I was just really into almond
shopping today I was looking at all this
and I literally was like reading all
about those sneakers and then this like
little video I played and it said that
they have these like special technology
that make your feet like not really hot
and they keep them like cool and I think
when I wear that was my feet aren't hot
but no no when I wear sneakers my feet
are like sweating is that TMI and like
random I don't know
basically I'm into online shopping and
I'm like a new like sneaker head so
that's what you've learned from this
video okay then the very last thing I
have to show you is that all I'm
definitely forgetting things but I've
just been getting so much the last thing
I'll show you are these black boots
because I can never have too many black
booties in these I found I'm like
clearance or sale or something and I was
like hey like I always need black
booties or stuff and I like that these
ones are just like flat these really
remind me of
Doc Martens don't these give you like
Doc Martin IDEs and Lucy how does it
look like these actually we she had them
in brown and black I think she has ones
that look literally the same as these
but dark Doc Martin but these are
Kenneth Cole and I'm like fairly certain
I got these for like $30 over like 40
maybe like they were on like super good
sale and they're super nice just like
leather little booties come around rings
at night that's what I like about these
they're like flat because I feel like I
can wear them in the day and night I
could talk all day about that black
booty Queen over here I love them okay I
think that is all for everything thank
you guys so much for sticking with me
I'm sorry this probably wasn't like the
best haul video ever because I know I
can't really try it on
but again I'm gonna try to find all the
pictures so I can like insert them
because that'll be like a lot quicker
for me um and yeah I gotta hop off to
class now but I will be guys so much and
I'll see you nice video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
