video and I'm super excited to show you
what I got I actually just got back from
Hilton Head Island off of South Carolina
Lucy and I and my dad just swam like
last minute for a little vacation to
visit some family I'm really happy I got
to go over my February break and I did
some shopping from Free People Urban
Outfitters and Nike and maybe like a few
other places I think that's basically it
though so let's just pop it into it okay
so one of those other places I said this
first thing I got up in the north we
don't have Piggly Wiggly grocery stores
but in the south in other parts of the
country I believe they have Piggly
Wiggly grocery stores and we see me and
my dad are just fascinated by them and
we really like them so we got these
Piggly Wiggly t-shirts and I just got
this like really pretty periwinkle blue
color I love it
it says Piggly Wiggly t-shirt and I
think it's so cute and there's a little
pig so it just decided I would show you
because I mean it's really cute like an
old thing so I'm just really excited
about that it's alright moving on to
Nike the first thing I got are actually
a new pair of sneakers and I don't even
know if the cutest knickers ever but I
actually just needed a new pair because
I have like a bunch pairs of those like
thin free runs but they don't have
enough like support for me when I'm
running I realize because they like
really hurt my feet and like my knees
and my ankle sometimes so I decided I
need a pair that are kind of like
thicker and have more support so I just
got these light blue and medium blue and
dark blue sneakers because I tried them
on and they have lots of good thickness
so they have good support for if you're
running so I'm super happy about these
so I can run without pain anymore next
thing I got it Mikey I went a little
crazy just a long-sleeve black shirt and
this is good for growing specifically
when it's like colder like when we get
on the water back to March it's gonna be
really cold and you have three lots of
layers so like long spandex shirts are
like the way to go and this one's really
thick and like warm so I knew I needed
this and actually a great one but I
don't have a black one so I was like I
really need this one this is very
necessary and the next thing I got is
actually just another black long-sleeve
shirt because like I said they're like
really good for rowing and like blending
outside blah blah blah but this one is
actually a little bit thinner so it's
more like
breathable and as a cool yellow neon
lining at the top and and as this cool
mesh detail on the back I don't know if
you can see it's like all these little
holes then I just got to sports rods
because obviously you need sports rise
when you're working yeah and I got this
it's like the Nike Pro like aqua blue
one and then I got this Nike Pro sports
but this is just like a really new
yellow sports bra and this will be good
too because you can never have too many
sports bra look good this fricking
Jackie I had to have it it's so cool
I've been saying I wanted like a new
jacket slick right outside it and this
is obviously perfect especially when
it's dark out early like here in the
Northeast it gets dark out pretty early
if you're like running outside at dusk
this will keep you definitely visible by
other cars and stuff and it stirs this
long sleeve jacket it's like pretty it's
a pretty thick I would say and I just
think you've so cute to work out in
because this neon yellow color is like
actually awesome and I'm not the part of
the video that you guys were probably
waiting for and wondering is actually
the giveaway part so it has to do with
free people so I went to free people
when Lucy me and my dad we actually went
into Savannah Georgia for the day and I
love that city I've never been but it
was super cool and it was really fun
I'll probably visit when I'm older
because I just like loved it there but
they had a free people there and they
don't have a free people where I live
and I got this shirt that you're seeing
right now that I'm wearing it's this
cold texture it's like a Henley shirt it
like buttons up and it has this really
pretty like maroon and white cuff detail
I've been wanting this exact shirt for a
while so when I went to this door and
they had it I was like freaking him out
and because I loved it and wanted it for
so long I decided I would buy two I got
one for you guys too
because I was like okay I love this
shirt like that all my subscribers will
too so I definitely wanted to get one
for you guys and we can be twins so I
did get two of them this is what the
giveaway is is this shirt so I haven't
done a giveaway in a while and I decided
I would get back to you guys so we give
me twins I'm so excited for whoever gets
this to enter the giveaway to get the
same shirt as me which is literally so
cute and I'm obsessed like I'm gonna
wear this look at every video you must

that you guys want me to do because then
I have an inspiration for what videos I

the giveaway for the shirt it's gonna
end March playing on so you have about a
full month to enter comment as many
times as you want below just make sure
that they're different comments so it
doesn't get flagged for spam and you can
get the same shirt as me I'm super
excited to be twins of you guys and I
just want to mention real quick they
actually run pretty big I noticed when I
went in this store I'm happy that I got
it in store because then I could try it
on and see what size I was so this one
right here is actually an extra small
and let me show you like it's not too
tight or anything like I have like it's
a good fitting but this is an extra
small and I think look I'm not that
small of a person I'm probably like a
medium sized human being like I'm five
foot eight so I thought that if I was an
extra small a lot of you would probably
be an extra small especially because I
know a lot of my audience is like
younger girls and I know a lot of you
are in like middle school so you're
probably not that big you're probably
smaller than me so sensei I'm not really
big I was debating on what size to get
you guys so I just got you the same size
as me which is an extra small it's due
time you might be able to wait till I
grow into it if it's too small for you
could like give it to a friend or
something I just got an extra small
because I decided it would probably fit
the majority of you which I know sounds
crazy because it's an extra small but I
swear they look fun big like this extra
small fits me guys so it'll fit you okay
and the Q is international so if you
live anywhere in the world you can enter
I don't care I will ship it to you even
if you live in like Japan or Australia
so yeah because I know a lot of you live
in like different countries too so
definitely its international so just
comment away and I will send it to you
wherever you live so I March 29th I will
just message you here on YouTube the
comment winner that Twins message me on
youtube and say congratulations you won
my giveaway and I will chip it to you
that way so that you can give me your
address and everything so definitely
keep an eye on your inboxes here on
YouTube so I can message you and picking
the giveaway winner is gonna be totally
random I'm gonna use random dog and find
a random winner so don't worry about
that it can be totally random
that we've gotten past the giveaway I
will continue showing you everything
else that I got the last thing I got
from three people is just this Hundley
shirt and it has like this cool tribal
pattern on the front oh it's almost the
same color is this I guess I really this
color I think they're super cute and
like basic that you can throw those like
a pair of jeans and you don't want to
wear that's what I wore to school today
alright and then the last place I'm
going to show you is Urban Outfitters
and I found a lot of good stuff here
this first thing I got is this really
really long cardigan like I don't even
know how to explain to you how long it
is like it goes past my knees but it's
like tight on the arms and it's kind of
like Fame so I thought it would be good
like transitioning into spring you could
wear with like any shirt or jeans or
shorts even it would actually really
cool with like crop top and shorts or
like a dress whatever whatever is just a
good plain dark gray cardigan I guess
dark grey black dark grey I think I
don't have a cardigan that is like as
long as this one so definitely like that
then I got this really cool romper and I
just saw it and I was like whoa I have
to have it I have nothing like this it's
like very unique looking so it's like
short sleeve on the top and it's this
like purpley dark blue floral pattern
with some like tribally designs it has
these little strings in the front better
or cute they're like tassels that's what
they're called
there's pants on bottom and it has the
same floral print and then like tribal
design right there and it just cinches
at the bottom I think this would be so
cute with some like leather sandals got
like buttons in the back too it looks
really cute art like it's like
flattering and then it hugs at your
waist but it's like flowy and it's super
cute and then the last clothing item I
got it Urban Outfitters is just this
black and white long sleeve sweater or
if you guys know this about me but I'm
like obsessed with stripes it's really
bad like if I see anything with stripes
like I automatically want to have it so
I saw this sounds like stripes but I
don't have anything that's black and
white stripes so I just applied myself
and buying it and it's actually this
really really long sweater I could even
be a dress probably on me like a sweater
dress and has this really cute zipper
detailing right here it's by the writing
unit which I know they have like really
cute clothes and then the last two
things I got from Urban Outfitters are
actually just accessories the first
thing I thought
these little gloves and I just think
they are so cute I actually have these
in gray I think I show them in a hall
not too long ago and I love these gloves
because they're super furry on the
insides and they keep you nice and warm
and it stays cold here until like April
so I was like I will still wear these
this winter last thing in this haul
video are actually these sunglasses from
Urban Outfitters they're like blue and
green and pink and purple rainbow
colored and I just think they're super
cool looking they make you look really
legit so I'm really happy I got these Oh
also in head South Carolina I got this
really cool assault lamp I'll insert a
picture right here
I just think it's so cute and I saw in
the storm and I really had to have it
it's just this cool lamp it's like
literally a block of salt with a hole
with drilled in it and you put like a
light bulb in it and then it just like
lights up and it's really cool pretty or
who's like unique that's everything I
got for this haul video thank you so
much watching and I will see you in my
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
