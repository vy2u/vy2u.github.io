whatever this is gonna be so cute and
I've always been scared of flannel
because I feel like it looks bad on me
so I never have anything flannel um but
yeah so I'm excited for this like to
style it because I never had anything
like Lana like and yeah the next place I
went to his friend were 21 and I was
most excited for forever 21 because i
was looking at my online website and i
found some really cute things but you
know when you're on forever 21 website
and if i have the cutest things but then
you go to the store to try to buy them
and they don't have them that always
happens to me and it drives me literally
crazy because i found the cutest things
and i want to buy them in the store and
they never have them or they don't have
my size like what happened today but
it's okay because i still had other
really cute things so the first thing i
got is these pearl earring set and you
guys may or may not have noticed but I
wear these pearls every single day like
I literally I probably have like four
different packs of pearls from forever
21 like I've so many um but like these
are like smaller and I wear pearls every
day because they go with everything and
I think they're really cute and ranked
last seen what not um but so I found
these and they're like huge which is
like so cool like an obnoxious I love
them so yeah I'm really happy I got
those and all of these were only 184 all
of these like it's so cheap so I'm super
happy I got those because I wear pearls
everyday so those are perfect for me and
then the next thing I got I stopped I
kept seeing there and like it's so
different and it would just like catch
my eye I never bought it and it's really
comfortable Mike stretchy and it's just
this Oh shirt and it's long sleeved and
it's like black-and-white kind of like
stretchy knit pattern you see you see
what I mean on but yeah it's just really
cute and it looks good on my gate like
sits nicely on your top you know um and
my friend said that black and weighs a
really big trend for spring so oh yes
sticking with those trends the next
thing I got I'm so so happy i got i got

they're so cute and I finally found one
that I loved so I'm so so happy I got
this huh it's gonna it goes with like
everything to like that i mislike match
everything and always look spectacular
you know um and I got it cuz in my head
this is all like working together as an
outfit on this is a black maxi dress and
it looks like this and it's shift fun
and really pretty black yeah I just love
it and um I'm 58 if you guys didn't know
so I'm pretty tall and this actually
goes long enough on me so it's a good
thing like it's almost too sure but it's
okay because it goes I went to my ankles
so that's like perfect because usually
maxi dresses are too short so yeah this
is great and this is a small oh I wasn't
thanks um that was a smell this cool
stretchy shirt that I was talking about
is a small oh then I said as before
thats labels media so it's everything
that I got at forever 21 and yeah they
have a lot of cute stuff right now look
I wanted this mint green maxi dress but
they didn't have it in my shy so I
couldn't get it but they have a lot of
cute things so definitely go check that
out at forever 21 ok next American Eagle
also how to do crazy sale like the whole
stores forty percent off which is like
really really cool and so I got these
high waisted light wash denim shorts and
I'm so happy i got these because um if
you've seen my obsession like DIY shorts
i love high-waisted shorts like I was
like right now I'm wearing high-waisted
black pants with like this muscle sure
and I'm so happy it was like really warm
today so I could like where I'm also
sure you know and like high-waisted
laughs I wear these in rapid of the week
and people were like where'd you get
them and I got my I got the you that
urban outfitters and I got that Sara
Burnett voters to so I'm really heavy i
got these and they were forty percent
off of 4495 so whatever that is there
good deal in our light wash the name
rips and they're literally perfect i
love that and next thing i got at
american eagle was this blue shirt it's
just like caught my eye you know like I
and people ask me what my style is and
as I said before I I don't even know
what i would call like myself because I
just buy stuff that I think looks pretty
or that what catches my eye that's like
different like I just I don't know like
I can just tell when I like something
and then that's what I get um so it's
like royal blue and it's this tank top
but it's really cool fit like it's
really flowing goes longer on the side
so that's what really unique and then it
has like this on what would you even
call this a tribal print like hi next at
the top and it's so pretty on and I can
also imagine wearing this with like
white bottoms white jean shorts or like
wipes um panty now and this is so cute
and it's like really comfortable so yeah
I love this I went to pacsun and I got
this like bando kind of cropped tube top
thing um and I know this is from the
Kendall + Kylie collection so that's
cool and it has like white lace and some
buttons and yeah this thing is just
adorable it was kind of expensive to
with for a cab and oh but i was thinking
like I tried these on together like this
and then like high waisted jean shorts
you know my me and it was so cute so
yeah and when this is on it kind of goes
longer like that's hard to explain but
it kind of like stretches out especially
if you're a flat like me um but so yeah
it's kind of like longer and then with
high-waisted shorts it goes really cool
or you can definitely definitely wear
like a shirt over this which is I think
it's probably too meant for because it's
so little um but yeah so that is
everything in this haul video and thank
