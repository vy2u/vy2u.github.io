wait summer filling in my backyard oh
yeah yeah yeah hey everyone so today I
have a haul for you and I'm really sorry
because I know I haven't posted a video
and like especially long time like 2
weeks almost yeah it's been two weeks
and I'm really really sorry about that
um as you know I tried like to post way
more consistently usually one or two
videos a week but I was really busy with
school and crew and everything and I'm
not going to be excuses that's just how
it is but um here is a collective haul
and yeah I'm really gonna just show you
what I got in the last like probably two
or three weeks and yeah so let's just
jump into it so first from Abercrombie I
got these white jean shorts just because
I wanted a new way to in shorts and I'm
usually like a zero like Abercrombie &amp;amp;
Fitch but I get a 16 and ever family
kids and they fit me like the same and
they're too pretty now so yeah these are
just forever coming kids and I love them
a lot and white shorts wouldn't we go
with everything in there like somewhere
in the spring so I'm just really happy
to have these and then from Victoria's
Secret I got these sweatpants first of
all and they're pink and they say love
pink with like a heart and they're just
done like what's it called dark pink and
they're literally the softest things in
the world like oh my gosh I like sleep
in them like ever see you're like oh
they're so soft and I just love them so
much and they're really comfortable yeah
there's so much next from victory seeker
I got a quarter zip and I seriously
wanted this for so long my friend
Caroline has it and yeah I'm totally
copying because I love it um it's like
heather gray and it has stripes at the
bottom and I was like a pocket and it's
just a quarter zip and all my friends
have the cutest quarter zip so I can
unfaith and my sister Lucy to I don't
know just everyone has like cute quarter
zips and I had like none so I just got
this great comfortable yeah so um
seriously everything I got from think
was like really really really discounted
because I went online and they're having
a good big sale so this was like twenty
eight dollars like literally it's so
good it used to be at 50 and same with
these swap hands they used to get 50 and
I think I got these for $30 and then the
next thing I got I got the same quarters
a button blast because I wanted the
black one too and like I said before I
have like no clutter zips um so is the
same as that tan like a gray one but
it's in black
yeah this was also a $28 so this is
seriously such a good deal and I'm
really thick and my comfortable and I
decided that I was just going to look
online because I went into this store
and I don't know if you know but
seriously like all of this venture so
they have now are like really thin and
like they're not like but not like you
take the sweatshirts that are looking to
keep you warm they're like thin like
pullovers but they're like really
expensive and I'm like no that's not
what I want
okay next Victoria's Secret I got these
bathing suit bottoms and they're just
like yellow crochet they're like neon
yellow actually and yeah I got these
because I have some like plain white
tops that would be really cute with
these for the summer and they're
seriously so cute I just say summer and
can you imagine like a really tan legs
and like a stomach like this with these
would just make it look so tan cuz it's
like neon and these are unjust super
sale these were like nine dollars so
these are like fantastic and then I got
this baseball tee um it's like white
with pink sleeves and yeah it's just
like comfortable and pretty cute with
like some white shorts like the ones I
got from Emma combi really like this
summer and just like throw one really
quick and it's comfortable and this was
on super sale as well it was like 14
dollars I want to say so that's like
really good and you see I'm like
accumulating like a pile of clothes like
it's just sitting in my lap whatever
start that bothers if you come I can see
it at the bottom this week okay
my order from brandy melville came in
yesterday and first I got this light
blue skirt and I saw on the model in
velvet looks so cute
look at obviously it's pretty short and
I'm like really tall so seriously every
single bottoming dress and skirt there
it's so short on me but I just have to
deal with it but they looks like I could
fit like a child like do you see like a
little like it's really stretchy but I
don't know like that's not attractive
like it's like a big rectangle like it's
like longer wide than it is up and down
you know I don't know but hopefully I
can figure out a way to I said maybe I
can wear it with this top even um but
yeah this is just I might have to try to
figure out what to do with this because
it looks very very small um I think it's
called like the Silvius skirt if you're
wondering it it was $22 okay next from
brandy melville I got these shorts and I
said I've seen a lot of people that have
these um and I liked them so much and
they were seriously so cheap they were
like ten dollars they were ten dollars
yeah and they're like I don't know like
flowery tribal prints and I did try them
on and these are so short as well but
that's just like a trend everything they
were short so yeah I just think like a
white shirt or maybe you could just like
lounge around and because they're just
really comfortable and I didn't realize
when I bought them they're kind of like
satin like they're not like they're not
like fabric like this like I'm not like
cotton they're like satin I don't know
but I like them a lot and they're really
cute and then I got these leggings
they're like tie-dye leggings and I feel
like seriously like every store sells
these now like today leggings like my
friend got so I'm at hmm that look look
just like these but I really really like
brandy Melville's logging is because
they're really like stretchy and they're
so soft and they're like thick like
these really good material it's a good
quality you know and
they're just like tie-dye I think these
are so cute and yeah the come on I think
everyone has these too but I don't know
I just really wanted them and then I got
this muscle tank top oh my gosh I think
she's working on these leggings we're
$25 so that's pretty good for the things
and then I got this muscle tank and I
don't know it's kind of like brownish
tan gray and there's a good girl skating
and she's like like I wish I was that
girl - I don't know okay so I just
really like this a lot and I don't have
any like muscle tanks from random elbow
I have the ones that are like crop
muscle Pink's but I don't have like a
long one it's really open like on the
side so I'm just excited to wear this I
have like nothing that's color either so
this should be interesting to see I mean
like wear it and this was $25 and next
from brandy melville I got this tank top
and it's kind of like a rose pink brown
color it's really like that you didn't
like washed out looking which I like and
it's like fan like spaghetti straps and
he cuts really low in the front and
really low in the back which I like and
it's like really craft to but I really
like this with like some high-waisted
shorts and like I'm already thinking of
like the bralette that I have that I can
wear everything from brandy melville
it's like black and it has like
crisscross these straps in the back
it'll look really cool with this because
yeah and I just think it's so cute it's
like basic for like the summertime you
can just throw on with like it's my
twisted shorts and like a sweater and
you're like ready to go like when I see
these I like picture outfit so I had you
know I mean and this was $19 I think yes
and then lastly from brandy melville I
got two rings which I was actually
really contemplating getting because I
have two rings from there and both of
them are completely broken um I don't
even know I think I hold them like a
really long time ago so if you want to
try to sign them it was like the first
time I ever ordered from there and I got
like a skull one and like a wraparound
one and they both broke like within like
a day but I decided I would just try
getting rings again and see what
happened and I really like this first
room that got it's um it's just like a
silver ring and it like it's a criss
cross II like pray I don't know it's
like thin and really basic and it'll go
with like a lot of things so I really
like that
and then I got these what's it called
the keying game ringing I think that's
it um I get them in views of like a
peace sign do you know what I mean but
they just look like that and as you can
see there are two different rings but
then they'll join into one and I
actually gave the top one to my sister
because we're twins and I know this
means like twins or something so I gave
her the top one and you each wear like
the juice it was you know what I mean
it's cute
and then I don't really like I don't
know if you guys care about these or if
you want to see them but I just decided
I would show you um I got new Free Runs
and they're just black because I like
running a lot and I go to crew practice
but then I run like aside from going to
practice cuz I just feel better when I
run and everything so I got some new
black free rides
I just thought I would show you what
let's just hit myself in the face but um
yeah because some people asked for like
workout videos and stuff but I really
don't know if I'll make one because like
I don't know I don't have I'm not like
trained I'm not like a professional like
I don't really know that much about
working out I really just um like go to
practice and like run on my own like
it's nothing like in depth like nothing
that will really help you uh-huh so yeah
I mean I just like go to my sports
practice ku practice and then I like run
sometimes in the morning sometimes
before and after practice
um but yeah and I just need a new good
running shoes become that old because my
old free runs are turquoise and they're
so worn out and I feel were trying to
her so I just got some new ones hey
y'all
so those chokers okay so I know this is
the towards the end of my haul video
that I film this morning um and I just
changed it to a different way sure in
case you're wondering but whatever so I
went to the mall today again surprise
surprise and I just wanted to like add
this and at the end of the hall because
it's collective and I got this today
yeah so first from Francesca's which is
actually I've been there before but I've
never bought anything I got a dress for
my friend's party tonight her sweet 16
and literally I'm so happy I bought this
like the cutest dress ever it's white
and it's like um kind of satiny and it's
it's just like a I don't know what kind
of dress cut this is called but it just
kind of goes straight down and it's like
sleeveless kind of as you can see it's
like a tank top and there's like these
really pretty um like pink and blue
flowers and on the side and it would
really look so cute on and I'm gonna
wear it with some like nude pump
so yeah that's gonna be adorable
and I don't really know if you want to
see this or not but whatever I got my
sister addressed there too because I
thought she needed one but then she
didn't and so this is gonna actually get
returned but it's so pretty so why not
show you but yeah I'm gonna have her
turn anyway because she doesn't need
just this dress or they'll just keep it
for myself actually anyway um it's like
this shear like Larry um cream-colored
dress and has all these really pretty
like I'm sorry I'm like leaving this wig
out of this Sun this one's my eye but it
has all these like embroiders what is
that call big patterns right there and
then it's like really pretty embroidery
at the bottom this smells good too it
smells like earthy perfume but so weird
okay but um yeah I think this is like
adorable as well even though she doesn't
look maybe I'll just I really might just
keep it for myself and Francesca's is
pretty expensive but like for like
special occasion dresses and stuff it's
like worth it I would say and do I see
the dress she actually ended up getting
I'll show you she end up getting this
dress from Express and it's like taupe
and peach and white and it's like a line
and yeah I think this one is cute too
I personally
but she doesn't like it so he knows
whatever I'm the yeah I piss too this is
where that I'm not showing you her
dresses but they're just like sitting in
front of me so why not
and then I ever 21 looking for a dress
before I went to Francesca's and found
my dress and you know when you're in
there you can just go and not buy
anything so their dresses weren't really
speaking to me this one I saw these
shorts and I was like um hello

okay that's perfect and then they have
like rips these are so adorable and
literally like um have you seen my DIY
obsession like shorts video whoa oh my
god those would be um then you know that
I love high-waisted shorts but for me
it's really hard to like make those like
just dressing like that like literally I
don't know how um so if I want
distressed ones I just have to buy them
so these are literally perfect
and they're actually like long enough on
me like they're not way too short and
these were cheap too these were only
seventeen eighty which is would really
so good and I was really cute I mean
superb shorts so they obviously have
been like hiding from me I don't know
where they been my life and I saw this
necklace and I was like hello I'm
obsessed with elephants because they
were literally adorable and I saw this
tiny little elephant necklace it isn't
it so cute it's like I don't even know
obviously it's just like a simple little
gold necklace elephant but it was just
speaking to me you know like come on

amelia is obsessed with other things too

little elephant necklaces and yeah I'm
really happy I got these
