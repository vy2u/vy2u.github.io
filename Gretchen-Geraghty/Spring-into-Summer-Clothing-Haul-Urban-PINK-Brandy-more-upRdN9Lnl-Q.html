video and sorry I know I've been really
really bad with my videos recently but
um it was just spring break I know a lot
of you guys spring break too and I went
to Florida with my boyfriend Justin so
I've been really really busy with that
and also like I'm a junior so we have
SATs coming up and like finals and
everything when I was in Florida I got
so incredibly burnt like I cannot like
explain enough when you go somewhere
this Sun is a lot stronger than where
you're used to usually so just be
careful I'm just my words of warning
like when I came back I wanted to film
but I it like literally made me sick
like my face got all swollen because my
face was so burnt like I'll put a
picture right here I was really happy
and nice and sunburned as you can tell
enough with my excuses but this is going
to be a very collective haul video I did
one of these last year I will link it
down below it was like spring into
summer fall and that's what this is
gonna be you can see right here but yeah
it's just a bunch of clothes that I got
kind of for the spring and summer but
ironically enough a lot of them are like
sweatshirts and sweat pants and like
jeans so I don't know I'm weird like
that but yeah we will adjust get right
into it
okay so first I'll just start off with
brandy Melville as usual yep
brandy Melville the first thing I got
from brandy melville is this white
sweatshirt and it says the end with two
little zeros I don't know it's just like
comfortable and it looks kind of cute
and interesting I think I might have
showed these in an outfit of the week or
like I wanted to Lucy and I are sharing
these we got these gray really soft like
I can't even explain to you they're
really soft skirts and they're good
because they're like high-waisted so
they actually covered my button or long
enough these skirts are really good and
long and we got a dark grey one and a
beige one then also from brandy melville
I got this white really flowy long shirt
and it's really stretchy and comfortable
and yeah it just goes with everything
because it's white and it's so stretchy
I love it from a sauce just this online
store I randomly just ordered these two
pairs of knee-high socks I got black
ones and gray and white ones and I know
it's like spring and summer now so I
don't even know if I can wear them that
much but I just think they're cute Ben
from Urban Outfitters
I got this forest green scarf you just
thought it was so cute and it's like all
this fringe and it'll still look really
cute I might wear and like an outfit of
the week soon and you probably even seen
these in some outfit of the week because
like I said it's collective over the
past like month and then of course I had
to get a sweater because it's so cold
out obviously I got a beige cropped
sweater and it's really thick and like
kind of warm I mean it's still good with
shorts like I wore it when I was in
Florida one night when it's chilly like
you know like your top can be warm you
can still wear shorts so I'll still wear
this and I think it's so cute and it's
really like neutral so it just goes with
everything forever 21 I got this white
flowy shirt and this is the only thing I
got there it's just like this white
flowy blouse I think it's really cute
and goes with a lot like I got a lot of
like basic things because I always buy
that crazy stuff so this is gonna make
Tori secret I got lots of sweatshirts
and sweatpants cuz that's how I roll and
they're like sweatshirts and sweatpants
from Tori secret are the best like I
know they're kind of expensive but
they're like really comfortable I got
these boyfriend ones they're like
heather gray and they say I love pink or
something like that like in coral right
there I think and they're just really
big getting comfortable and I like wear
them to bed and I also got ones like
them but a navy blue and they're like
the boyfriend ones and they say love
pink down the side in coral and then
from pink I got two sweatshirt spirit
jersey type thing start it's like piling
up right there
but I got this heather gray one and
stuff there one's really big like all
this it's like extra small I just I'm
well you know i'm 5-8 like I'm not like
really little and I think pink just runs
really big because these are extra
smells and they're still like baggy but
this is like heather gray and it says
love hate or like just do this once a
just think across the bag I don't know
yes is pink across the back in white I
think I like this one even more I got it
in maroon too and I just think it's so
cute you definitely saw this in Africa
that week I think but um it's maroon and
it says this one says love pink across
the back and white and I actually got a
spirit jersey yesterday my crew got it
and it's this blue one and it says crew
across the back and you see my back just
grab
but yeah I like this one too the next
thing I'll just mention I've been
wanting to show you guys my Alex and Ani
is I think maybe there was a questions
about them I wore them in one outfit of
the week and I had four and now I have
five so my cupcake Alex and Ani my best
friends Alex and Ani with my twin sister
my monkey I was not even dressed in my
seahorse Alex and Ani and then my
elephant and I like love them and I wear
them all the time I think they're so
cute and then I don't know if you can
even see these bracelets we all thought
they're probably not focused sorry but
one says GLB and one says I love beauty
Thank You Meghan you're the best my
friend Meghan made these for me because
my name is Shelby and I do beauty and
peace oh so while I was in Florida over
spring break my twin sister was in
France for like a school trip like you
guys know how I went to Costa Rica over
Febby I break she went to France was
just so cool she got me a new Longchamp
bag and I wanted this one for so long
it's like the beige one if you guys have
seen my black one that I've shown in my
athletic videos I think it just say mine
is my black one but with the long
handles and it's like perfect for school
it's just like a tote bag and I love it
and it's new and I can say I got it from
France so that's really cool she said
they had like a jillion colors an
American ago I got two things
I got pants because I like never have
enough pants it's so weird I got these
royal blue I think they're like jogging
eugen things and I wanted to go out of
my comfort zone because I never really
wear colored pants but I think these are
really cool so I got those and then I
got these black pants and I just think
these are really like practical because
I always wear I wear like things like
every day if you've seen my outfit of
the week videos so I decided to actually
get black pants and they have like cool
little zippers right there and like
pockets and everything so I got these
cool black pants I'm like obsessed with
dresses and both of these are like the
same kind this one I got from
Francesca's and it's like this little
boutique place that they have but it's
like it's like a chain like they have it
at like different malls but I just think
their stuff is so cute and I've got
another dresses that I loved before from
there it's just this like purpley shift
dress
and so it's like loose and like high in
the neck and the reason I bought it look
at the back look at how adorable this is
it's a bow I think it's so cute and I
love it and I'm gonna wear it probably
like out to brunch or something I just
like picture myself wearing it out to
brunch but I think it's so cute I'm
obsessed with it while I was in Florida
we went to Urban Outfitters and I got
this dress and I just think it's really
interesting and I like anything I have
it's this black and white shift dress
and it's really like loose and high in
the neck again and it like zippers in
the back and I think it's so cute
