quick summer clothing haul and it's
pretty much from one place which is
Karmaloop or plunder I don't know I
think it's kind of like the same thing
but yeah so it's all pretty much online
except for one pair of shoes which I got
from Target so this is just gonna be a
quick little summer haul and it'll be
try on so you can see everything that I
got which is cool because I always liked
watching haul videos where you can
actually see what the people got like
how it looks on them okay so the first
thing that I got from plunder it's
really funny actually it's pretty bad so
I went to go open the package and my dad
was like Gretchen be careful when you
open that because you don't want to cut
your clothes on my dad you always tell
me I got this okay and I cut out the top
and I cut a little hole in my dress so
the first thing is it's really pretty
dressed but I don't know if you can even
tell there's a hole right there it'll be
okay though it's even my hair will like
cover it you know it's like on my
shoulder so it'll be okay but anyways
it's this really pretty dress
and it's like floral and it's from the
brand bill along and I think a lot of
this stuff is from Billabong I like like
they're like style
it's like three-quarter sleeve and I
love it cuz it like flares out right
there and I has like lace and in the
back has all these little Criss crosses
so yeah that's the first thing and it's
like so so cute and then the second
thing is also from Billabong it's just
this like really casual 3/4 sleeve
t-shirt yep it's like a baseball t-shirt
I think they're called cuz it's like
white and then it's red and blue stripes
right there and I like wearing really
just like basic tops like this and I got
this long sleeve t-shirt from obey and
it's grey and it says obey and read and
just I feel like I wouldn't normally
wear this is kind of like out of my
comfort zone but that's good you know
and I still think it's cute and it's
like comfortable so yeah yeah and then
these are also from Billabong and
they're these are just short shorts and
they're fabric fabric e fabric why can I
speak they're just like floral print
shorts and they're really cute and
they'd be good with like white flowy
tops for the summer with
sandals you know and then at the bottom
they get all fringy right there they
kind of remind me of like a rug a little
like a print of a rug but I like them I
can get cute and the last clothing item
I got I'm actually really excited
they're like acid-wash high-waisted
ripped jeans and they fit me like a
glove I have high waisted acid-wash
jeans from the Kylie and Kendall ones
from PacSun but they don't have rips in
them and these have rips in them so I
think they're just really like different
and edgy
Huell and stuff like I said before I got
one pair of shoes at Target and I got
these leather brown sandals and I just
wanted these because um I don't know if
you guys know but I have them in black
they're like brown on the bottom and the
straps are black and I've had them for a
while and I really really like them like
I find myself wearing them all the time
so then I saw them in brown and I was
like I really need them I also just
broke my Brown mother flip-flops so
these are going to be nice for the
summer and they match like a lot of
things like brown leather flip-flops I
fit just good with everything and match
was age for my quick little haul like I
said it was very very quick but I hope
you enjoyed it I'm playing to have lots
of cool videos during the summer like
I'll have like more summer hauls and
like back-to-school halls and like I
probably do like back-to-school hair
video and like I said before I'll have a
fitness routine up soon and cool like
collections and tours and such because I
haven't done like a room tour like a
bathroom tour like makeup collection I
have never done any of those so keep an
eye out they may be coming your way but
yeah that was just my quick little haul
and I hope you enjoyed bye
