Sontag I'm really excited for summer as
you can see I'm in my backyard right now
so the first question is a hair product
for the summer so my hair product for
the summer is this Moroccan and argan
oil by the brand organics this is like
this spray and I put this in my hair
after my shower I just like rub it in
the ends and I love this it's worked so
nice it makes it really nice and smooth
you can like you know happiness and then
the next one is body product so this is
gonna have to be my pink fresh Vanilla's
dream on body lotion this stuff like I
want you to smell right now it smells so
good it smells like heaven and I
absolutely love that for summer
oh sorry 7 the next one is the next one
is skincare product this is my
Neutrogena oil-free acne stress control
power exfoliating scrub this is really
nice for the summer um anytime really
you just need like a really good
exfoliator for the summer because you
get sweaty and dirty and ever so this is
a must-have for summer I love this stuff
and then the next one is face product so
this is just gonna be like any at tinted
moisturizer really because you don't
want to be wearing too much like liquid
heavy like foundation during the summer
so I just grabbed this is the Neutrogena
Healthy Skin one I love that one that
one's really light though this one's
also barely it's the covergirl aqua
smoothers and then the last one that I
recently got in a haul you saw is a bomb
shelter by the balm I really really like
that one
ok so my summer bag of tricks is self
tanner oh sorry
I don't not I do not use self tanner
because I just like to get a natural tan
so I
I might be using any soft hammer this
summer the next one is sent and this
actually goes with my like lotion this
is the fresh Vanilla's dream on pink
body mist this like these smells like
are so good like they smell like summer
maybe summer and I'm so happy I love
these it smells so good I wear all the
time then the next one is nail polish
actually wearing it right now I wear all
the time in all my episodes you'll see
this nail polish um this is 405 coral
reef by Sally Hansen hardest nails
extreme where I feel like I've seen
other people talk about this on YouTube
look everyone has this so this is
awesome go buy that if you don't have it
or like any other coral color because I
feel like you just need a good coral
color for summer um the next one is odd
product so I just grabbed I got a lot um
I really like creating shadows for the
summer because again I don't like to
wear too much eyeshadow in the summer
like I just don't wear as much makeup so
I grabbed these are the Maybelline Color
tattoo ones this one is in tenacious
teal it's like a pretty blue I just or
that if I'm feeling crazy um this one is
called toughest hope this is a really
nice taupe color I would wear that a lot
and this one is called bad to the bronze
I love this one this is just like
neutral to my back all the time the next
one is clothing so I grabbed two pieces
of clothing that one I wore recently and
then outfit of the week or maybe set up
yet I don't know um but this is a shirt
from forever 21 you guessed it it almost
is for man and it's just like kind of
like a Mexican like tribal print like
flowy shirt and I love this shirt so
much I actually bought it to go to
Mexico in the winter and when I wore it
someone's like that reminds me Mexico so
yeah that's really nice and then also
any kind of like baggy loose tank top is
really nice for this summer
be wearing this a lot it's just like a
waste tank top from forever 21 again and
I really like wearing Bandos with shirts
in the summer because they can give look
at my pop of color and you don't feel
like wearing a big heavy tank top um and
then the very last thing in this tag is
an accessory and I love these earrings
so much they are mint green earrings
from forever 21 like feather ends and
they look like this they can give you
your outfit a really nice pop of color
okay go here right now um these earrings
are just awesome and they're so bright
minty green and they have some like
jewels at the top you can tell it's a
Sun um these earrings are awesome
I love it so much so that is my
accessory for this tag and I think I'll
just show you right now I'm going to the
mall so I'll just show you my outfit
real quick I'm wearing these awesome
shorts that my friend let me borrow gate
so this is my outfit can you see it I
didn't even know these are the crazy
shorts and this like satchel is from
forever 21 again and then just this
baggy white shirt my hair is down and
then I'll show you my shoes I wear these
all the time because they match
everything look these white sandals
they're Moroni and Target I love these
so thank you for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
