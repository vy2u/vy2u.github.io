watching
happy vlogmas day 13
I always forget what day it is Mekhi and
I are about to go to breakfast and this
morning I put on running shorts to go
for a run but I didn't make it on the
run so I was halfway there didn't
actually go you know it's the thought
that counts
and then I'm importing some footage for
my hair care routine from the GoPro
hopefully it turned out good the only
thing is I think there's some like water
droplets across like the front of the
camera so that might make it kind of
screwed up but hopefully I can like get
some good pieces also I painted my nails
this morning so even though I didn't
work out it's still been a productive
morning Hank because I know my nails are
really cursed before and I think Lucy
and Taylor and I are meeting one of our
good friends from high school for lunch
on Newberry so that'll be fun I know
Aaron want to be in vlogmas because I
know she watches in my video sometimes
so that'll be super fun I don't know
it's so nice I was thinking last night
how we can keep our window open in
December that's crazy because usually
it's so much colder and like it's not
even that cold right now with the window
open because it's like freaking 60
degrees out it's miserable too hot I
know my guys from California and he's
probably like waiting for the snow and
meanwhile it's like global warming out
here I don't even know it's so warm
hopefully there's a white Christmas when
I go home my feathers not gonna be just
because it's so like warm now I like
when there's white Christmas but yeah
we're gonna go get breakfast now maybe
I'll film there but a lot of times I get
too embarrassed because it's the dining
hall so everyone I'm really proud of the
outfit I put together cuz I feel like
usually I pick clothes I don't match so
yeah you can never really go wrong with
a contained sweater though this potatos
letter is from PacSun these pants are
from Uniqlo which is this place in
Quincy Market that Taylor showed me and
they were seriously like nineteen
dollars and they're like jeggings and
like maroon and then I'm wearing these
Sperrys shoutout Hannah I stole them
from you in like seventh grade and I
still wear them kind of
Nicholas Justin got me before we came to
college it's purple and might show your
outfit you look so cute right now
no you look adorable that's better it's
been three people right and that vest is
from Abercrombie and those are for
everyone I figured out this the best
even looks good with it too so I'm
really proud of myself I feel like I
really can never make outfits but it
works oh yeah I did put a picture of you
on my snapchat story all my followers
would see ya
Taylor sticky poo hmm it's okay I love
your makeup
it'll all be better you look beautiful
always yeah you do
your hair is just a little fluffy I love
you do I can you say what you just said
again there's ona can that I dropped
well I dropped one of Taylor's shelters
and it's all like demented now I bet the
liquids inside they're still good okay
ready
me you just said a good question the day
yeah what would you sing I would sing
don't stop believin is that done they
always play at the end of dances of our
high school dances yeah a team that won
it's a good jam David say hi David with
your instagraming partners where
cleanliness yeah can i I was talking
about this in the car with them
Tommy to take another brain cavity right
now and we've never been here and it
looks like a really cute place I'm
excited we just met some subscribers
that was so excited she was so cool I
wanted that was so funny because Aaron
Aaron had just said like do you ever run
into people
subscribers and I forget to like put
them in videos if I'm like walking okay
so
what's going on let's get this honest it
might be the street performers really
cool place I'm excited me too
oh it's so pretty when it gets dark out
and they turn on all the lights all the
Christmas tree lights I've never heard
of this place
Oh Marino yeah it's gonna be so yummy I
think I'm gonna get cookie bar in
vanilla yeah I see a manufacturer real
quick you know they make them in little
in little flowers they Meckler and dive
in and one of those and forever this is
art see how they make the like it is her
face let me get ours oh yeah okay mister
it goes like really slow but yeah look
at all these flavors I think you can get
a different flavor for like each petal
I'm not sure which ones I'm gonna get
I'm use a cookie butter one though so
it'll be good how to show it
wait what flavors did you get the cookie
butter and chocolate hey what's up guys
i speculoos vanilla I think so hazel not
it's like cookie butter I don't know if
you've ever had any butter and then um
chocolate I think later we might go with
Anna to go to on we like
how he sees me taking a video hem get it
buddy
oh wait that one okay guys
apparently this is from so you life in
Zack and Cody this is the hotel actually
our yesterday's it's kind of iconic
looking if you ask me oh my god the
chocolate store let's go there Hayes
trying to hold his hand but she doesn't
let me to behold the pinkies likes to
just like I'm like can you tell everyone
how much you love me because in my walk
missus I keep commenting that you hate
me no I'm not kidding they're like
they're like Lucy doesn't see much she
likes you I know but you really do love
me right yeah okay last time I was in
here
I was going around vlogging like this
and the Prudential Center with Lucy and
everyone thought I was quite off
oh yeah Lucy changed in those trees
right there because she got a new
sweatshirt and she had to take off her
shirt it zooms in so slow lookit because
no one else knows how to really like
this is Josh's debut they've only seen
the back of Josh's have a good
explanation
love it say hi Josh bagels were you
giving her a kiss just then you can see
a photo of Josh now at the banquet here
why are you gonna take one together yeah
okay if I remember to put it in what are
you doing practicing is that a tag on
the sleeves does that need to be taken
off I was like that doesn't stay there
does it always forget to fill them on
the tee but that would be fun do
people know you know I was like so
pretty I was like I'm so tired
but I'm so happy we go it's not too bad
especially because I'm wearing gloves I
feel like this is kind of like overkill
that I'm wearing gloves right now I
brought my min I just went for it
yes yes that's a little game wait guys
did you know Jackie the other day saved
my life when we were running like I'm
like straight up saved my life
I'm not kidding so we're like at an
intersection like this right and oh yeah
and I saved my life with the T so we're
just like running along I like it didn't
even hit me that it was like an
intersection like I don't know so I just
kept going and she was like two rows her
arm out in front of me and like pulls me
back
wait Taylor that's where the street
performers are it was like not I'm Mike
and everyone oh yeah I think like the
actual Fanueil Hall is closed right now
it's the food inside I just not vlogging
and I'm starting again because it's so
pretty
oh my god it's so big remember before we
gonna stay for when they like lighted it
lit it lighted Wow
I tried but then it got too late wow
those are so cool you're such tourists
I know I'm like today I'm like I'm
literally tourists even though we like
live here
look at all the lights we take my
picture shoot couples making right oh my
wild they're so cute this isn't some
really stupid but is that a real truth I
have to be real right can we touch it I
think it is but my question is where do
I find a tree that looks like that
really so big like there's no way
because I know the one that's in like
Rockefeller centers how do they get it
though I can wear that's crazy just look
at how big it looks this is creep yeah
well I want to go home now for Christmas
I'm ready we figured out guys the tree
is real we even touched it and smelled
it
yep it's real where are we
it's even pretty sitting here you can
like see all the legs and stuff so cute
I think I mean they're gonna get either
pie tie or
kind of teriyaki chicken what does
everyone think of their dinners on you
got seaweed salad and I need to get that
some time because it sounds cool and uh
God I think you got what's he called
teriyaki chicken
I got Pad Thai and fun fact I've never
had Pad Thai but I'll try oh yeah Lucy
would like that Hannah would hate that
you would need that Gretchen can't use
chopsticks so she's turned to using one
chopstick instead of two since she can't
use them let's just see how it works you
can't even twerk it like a funder you're
the worst hey you take your pictures
no I'd better gob is getting ready for
her close-up
there you are Toby its Anna here filming
for vlogmas Taylor's a pro photographer
oh look at the pretty tree
yeah get Hannah
oh my gosh this is insane
there's always a huge line Wow this
peanut butter brownie is oMG all right
everyone I got two cupcakes and a
brownie and this brownie is like the
best thing I've ever eaten in my whole
life is an Oreo when I'm bringing Lucy
and then I know how to eat this thing
and then I'll probably like share this
with my cry because I told her it's like
the best ever and Taylor and I are about
to go to Target and we said we feel like
Aspen and Parker because we miss their
blogs and they're like always a target
right I think I feel like every day
I
can you tell how big it is on vlogmas
yeah but I feel like our new picture
took a picture that you can't even tell
they get it like this thing is but it
like a brick it probably is about I'm
not it's so good it's really heard hear
your mouth
it's chocolate peanut butter I won't
show you don't eat it myself eating it
because you guys get mad at me and I got
what did you get Nana a German K German
cake yeah like it's so quiet that's
browning I roll
guess where I'm actually kind of excited
we realize any likes going to like
Target and like Garcia stores and stuff
here because it like reminds us of home
and it's 10:30 at night very very far
from campus yeah we're kind of like
walking around alone in the dark like a
little danger we'll be okay we know our
way around it's not focusing on the
always focuses like on the back lots q
if I good for Fenway no get the light so
I'll be comfy Oh guys the whole reason I
wanted to come here I think I talked
about this in another and another vlog
most of the other day I was like show
look I really want to go to Target um so
that I can give a caii mention scarves
and they have this like little sale that
was like buy one get one half all I'm
like that's perfect but it took us way
too long to come here because we wanted
to like three days ago we never went so
now the sale is gone and they didn't
even have the scarf that I wanted to get
off
on another note I am getting these fuzzy
pants like these are gonna be the best
decision I ever made
tell me this doesn't look like Aspen she
has one on her couch that looks like
that except for says like peace we're so
creepy we're literally like in love
they're just so cute like actually I
think I need like an interior decorator
for my house and I'm older because I'm
not going to handle all of this it's
like kind of overwhelming you know wait
stop this other youtuber Claudia has
this advent calendar and every day in
vlogmas she like opens it up today is
what 13 guys look at this is symbolic of
today one of you actually commented I
don't remember your name but thank you
so much for this idea you said you and
Macaulay I scream all the time yes we do
it pretty much every night and he said
you should get an ice cream scooper for
your dorm so you know what I'm gonna get
her an ice cream scooper and it's
probably the best present she ever got
because she didn't even know she needed
it Oh get her that's frozen one oh my
god Justin this is for you he's gonna
kill me for saying this he loves frozen
you would die so I think that's Anna
he likes Elsa I'm pretty sure they have
our favorite cups guys this is one I
have that we always talk about here's
what it looks like at Target if you're
wondering because I think I still get
comments like where is it from like what
does it look like this is the exact one
I have and it's the best ever because
when you take out this straw it has like
a little lever right there and when you
go like that like nothing comes out it's
like a shaking shake and go that's
actually what it's called and it's from
mrs. Brown the idea sweet look kitchen
utensils I want a pretty one I'm boring
oh there's a blue one oh my gosh that's
present ever we want to know what I just
thought of you know you're obsessed this
is aspin favorite color people are gonna
be like shut up your success literally I
know this is your favorite color because
she always talks about how like aqua
cream and blue is your favorite color
what did shell
yes it is no it is it is he gave one to
on my own the other day with a chocolate
coin I'm so mad that they have these
pillows now cuz I used to want like a
pillow like this so bad and I bought
like the $60 one at Pottery Barn and
really I should they got like a cheaper
one at Target but I didn't know they
have that this is so crazy that's
actually so funny remember how like in
awe we were the first time we came here
we were like this is crazy
yes I remember when he has so arm
washes now that was so oh my gosh that
is from the Christmas story Elsa my dad
think that thinks that part is so funny
oh my god I actually need to get this
for Justin I'm not kidding he probably
would love it you would like die I'm
gonna get it from your welcome Justin me
too I can't get married it'll be a good
time oh good time of her life you
probably thinks I'm sorry your time is
up now um excuse me what are these why

get those whoa what are those
ginger bread Oreos I actually want to
try those gingerbread snap gum
peppermint gum where have I been

myself like I just always do this so I
stopped filming out and it's probably
annoying anyway because I'm just like
