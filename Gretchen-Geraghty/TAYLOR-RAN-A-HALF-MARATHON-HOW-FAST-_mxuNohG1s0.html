Taylor save be good until I woke up
literally two seconds ago but you know
kind of Jeffrey Taylor rolled out a bad
brush my teeth and you're going and I'm
wearing my so are we gonna go to the
finish
yeah I think yeah watching my 11:00 if
the roads open we can like bloopers I
finish if not he's gonna take this from
me but she told me first and she was
saying she was like if not like yourself
we're at home which like we're don't
should you go home with you let's see
you at the end yeah I definitely waited
at the end mood just once you finished
me could about you read by any could
motivate you closer at beginning but you
think you should just go to the episode
yeah and I'm like violin will be good
cuz I'll be after I know I can't wait
how come early and right now we have
space for work okay okay okay everyone
there is Taylor do you like my picture I
have for her it's very thin big tails
she's by Trader Joe's so I would say
she's like five minutes away so cute
so I'm gonna just do - and I'll put it
on every one just that tailor read by so
happy it was really great join me in the
vlog we're about to watch Molly run by
and I'm really excited I know she's like
in her element when she runs I feel like
running just makes her so happy so she
was really happy I sent the video to her
mom okay guys so it was really fun
seeing Taylor run by and then Molly and
then also like being with my own eyes
and see my own so long she used to go to
bu and run with us but now she goes to
mass she transferred I just really get
detailed run by and she's so happy and
when she just called me and she was at
the finish and she's waiting for Molly
finish and she's like it was really good
it was just um
a little windy and there was like a lot
of potholes in the mud what was crazy
was we saw people running by barefoot
and like what would you do if your foot
what do you know any cobble or like a
rock like I don't know have you got to
run barefoot let me know I think I've
done on the beach or anything when I
have maybe on the track like once for
funsies my featured dress Oh fun fact my
head has been hurting for like three
days straight
in my neck too and I think my neck
hurting has made my head hurt Megan gave
me I ripped open and I feel way better
isn't it weird how like if you take pain
medicine it just knows where to go and
your body like where it hurts
probably doesn't work like that I don't
know how it's an anti-inflammatory so it
doesn't yell when it needs to do it but
like it goes everywhere yeah my Marathon
winner

you so tired right now here an apology
mid watermelon I mean I know yeah you
just ran there if you were so happy at
mile 11 you looked like you ran for five
minutes before you looked like totally

run faster so that's what I did I could
have kept going and I feel like I could
