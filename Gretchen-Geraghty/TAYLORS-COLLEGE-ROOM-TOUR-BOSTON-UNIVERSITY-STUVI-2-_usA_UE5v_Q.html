Megan and I are going to take over the
blog for today because Gretchen has
finals this afternoon and some other
ones during the rest of this week that
she has to study for so she thought it
would be fun if we took the fog over
brew day so I'm really excited it's
around lunchtime so I already like had
lift and I went to class this morning
and a super requested video from you
guys has been a room tour so I thought
that I would go ahead and do that as my
vlog take over so I will go ahead and
show you guys that and then I have
practiced this afternoon and some other
things going on so I'll block as much as
I can and I think Megan will blog later
tonight because she's going to dinner
with her dad and also for the room tour
I'll try and link as many items as I can
down below I don't know how many I'll be
able to find just because I've gotten
some like throughout the years or a lot
I got at the beginning of freshman year
and I've just been able to keep so I'll
try and find as many similar items as I
can and yeah let's get into it but now
I'm eating lunch it's pretty much about
you like everyday for lunch I have a
wrap with banana and peanut butter and
then I just have a bunch of fruit that I
cut up or I'll have veggies so it's
usually like four veggies that I just
cut up and eat and it's raining outside
which stinks I have one more class that
I have to go to you at two o'clock and
it's like a mile away so I might try and
take the bus but I don't know
okay the long awaited room tour this is
probably a really bad time to do it
because it's mid-afternoon and really
dark that's okay we're just gonna go
with it so when you first walk in I have
a couple pictures on my wall and then on
the opposite side of the door I have a
container where I just keep all of my
like socks and sports bras and then this
is where I throw my headphones and keys
when I come back from class and then I
have to wall hangs that canvas painting
is from Hobby Lobby and then the white
picture frame I got from Target then on
the other side where my desk is I have a
couple of wire containers which I know I
got from Target this year so they
probably still have them just to hold my
books and some other miscellaneous
things and then this I got also at Hobby
Lobby and this is where I keep all of my
makeup and hair brushes and stuff and
then miscellaneous jewelry over there
and then I have these two signs hanging
up that is a med
tractor sign that I got from the place
that I worked out over the summer and
then this hanging I got off of Etsy and
I know that they have a bunch of other
cute designs that you can choose from so
you can choose like the color and the
background that you want I got that as a
going-away present for college then my
laundry basket then over here I have my
bed and all my betting I got from Target
except the blue and the gold throw
pillow I got from Marshalls
and those I also got freshman year the
monogram also came off of Etsy and they
have a really great website you can like
choose the size that you want and this
is my headboard that Gretchen gave me
from a website that I believe she worked
with and they have a bunch of different
like custom designed head boards and
then right next my bed I have my dresser
this is like usually where I get ready
in the morning so I have all of my
jewelry over here my makeup brushes and
then this lamp which I actually found a
similar base - I got this freshman here
as well but I recently found a similar
base to this because a lot of people
have been asking about it I think it's
like really cute and and then this
picture frame my mom's friend made for
me freshman year and I know that she
bought the frame this white frame by
itself and had like these knobs attached
to it and then she took scrapbook paper
and put those into each of the little
frame so this would be super easy to
make if you wanted something similar to
it as you can see my main theme is blue
and gold everything is blue and gold and
then that is my closet right there and
then this Gore Mountain sign that's
where we ski up in upstate New York
and this was a print and that's it so I
hope you guys liked it if you have any
questions about anything that you see
you can go ahead and ask oh I have a
bunch of stuff under my bed too that's
where I keep like all of my big duffel
bags and water bottles and shopping bag
so that's why that's kind of a mess
under there but if you ignore that there
you go
so now it is time oh and I also hung
some Christmas lights for Christmas so
now it is time to go to class and
practice so we shall blog some more now
I am going to my last class of the day
which I am kind of late for because I
was filming a room tour but I
know how to film but that's okay I tried
my best I hope that you guys liked it
and if you don't that's also okay
because I had no idea what I was doing
and I think the lighting is really good
oh look Gretchen loves garbage what a
surprise
I'm going to write five probably
literally and then I am meeting Sam to
go and finish artwork out for the day so
we like started this morning but it was
early and who he just didn't finish it
all and you know what sometimes that
happens they're gonna go back and finish
it which is why we have to go to
practice later
so yeah I don't know if I'm gonna fill
them walking down I'm have but perhaps I
will try so you can see that peoples of
Cana have look nice and rainy and cold
outside what a day and see oh there's
the bus that I just missed I had big
plans to take the bus which is why I
like film the room tour cuz it's like
I'll just fill in the room tour and then
take the bus and then sure enough I only
messed up like five thousand times so
we'll have a very edited room tour and I
can show you that I think I get worse
blogging because I just kind of forgot
to vlog after I did the room tour but
anyway Sam and I went and we finished
our minutes and then I came back and I
did some poor work and I just took a
shower and like started to blow dry my
hair and now I am going to go to Target
because I have to get a couple things
and I think I'll probably make Gretchen
some cookies because she's been so
stressed out with all her finals in core
and like who doesn't love a good cookie
so that's what I'm gonna do
and I'll make dinner so you guys can see
that and also this new song is dope I
don't even know if it's near
probably not know what it's like Calvin
Harris and I normally don't like
anything about country but like this is
pretty dope I really enjoy it my broker
thing and it slipped see I have no words
there we go
I'm Shawnee bad all right so that's our
next endeavor is target and then I don't
think I can open the Christmas presents
for bloggers like how fun would that be
also one last thing before we leave I
saw a lot of people asking about this
black jacket and it's the most basic
black North Face jacket one could own I
got it last winter and I don't remember
like what make it is but it's just kind
of like a quilted pattern and it's super
thin but like also very warm that's good
ooh kiks kiks on fire how about dad ma
damn okay so now we're gonna go to
Target XD feel like I could talk to this
thing all day and you're pros like shut
up but one other thing that I did today
was every year we do adopt a family for
Christmas and if you don't know what it
is usually like your town or city will
organize it and you can adopt a family
for the holidays and so you can provide
them at the Christmas gifts and usually
it's just like little things like a
couple little toys for the kids and then
like hats and gloves or some clothing
and actually my team is doing it this
year too we adopted a couple families in
Boston so if you can do that I think
it's a really great way to be helpful
during the holidays and get back if you
can so that's just something to think
about and maybe I'll be done talking now
it's a cutie I just found you're a
church Yogi's and I'm just a poser
it's a
Shelby nah she's busy today oh look at
the view bus say hey squad goals okay
Wow
bye sis what I'm meeting for dinner I
mean I have a suit potato some tofu and
then just a little veggie platter and
some country tunes I just got done with
dinner and usually Meghan Gretchen I try
and eat dinner together daily but since
Gretchen had or Tessa made went out we
didn't get to eat dinner tonight so I
just had dinner by myself
and then I did all those dishes and then
I feel like everyone's been doing like
such great things likely that the job
that she really wanted and Maggie got an
internship that she wasn't itself
I made some Christmas chocolate-covered
pretzels for everyone so that they can
have them when they get back to me it's
kind of a mess and not Martha Stewart so
it doesn't matter and here and then
hopefully Gretchen will be able to come
back and open her up her father's
presents that you guys can see that too
I like it excited cuz I want to know
what that all the present how could you
not see what gets a wild Sammy oh wait
they're over on the counter and a little
baggie I put you together a baggie no no
there's supposed to be Christmas themed
they're probably so like kind of warm
but I like threw them in that fur you
know for a little bit they're good I
thought they would be a good study snack
for people like yourself well bleep look

there is I don't know how to use it but
