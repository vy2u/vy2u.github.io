filming a teeth-whitening challenge and
I've never really done a video like this
before but we just thought it looked
really fun and so we're gonna try it out
basically what we have is some candy
that we think is going to make our mouth
kind of stain Lucy just has some like
red cherry belts and I have a blue ring
pop and hopefully they're going to make
our mouths kind of color that will be
fun and then what we're going to do is
brush our teeth so that we can use our
like teeth whitening systems they look
like this they're from vanity planet it
just looks like this like you have your
little mouth dry in your syringe and
listen I are super excited to try out
this teeth whitening system because who
doesn't want a whiter smile you know but
it really would really think so yeah
I've tried like teeth whitening before
what I haven't really been like
consistent with it so hopefully this
works out really well your recommended
to try this puppy out for two to three
months to see like the best results and
also you can get seventy percent off of
this teeth whitening system with the
code love your smile and I will have all
of that linked down below so you can
find out where to get yours I think it's
like a super good deal to get seventy
percent off because I know they're like
pretty expensive on its own the seventy
percent office like most of the cost if
you like what you see you can like check
it out and we're just really excited to
get into this this should be fun I think
oh and also in case you're wondering
we're gonna brush our teeth after we eat
the candy before we put in teeth
whitening things because I it probably
wouldn't be good to have lunch candy and
our teacher trying to wait our teeth but
also I think the teeth whitening systems
are more for working on like intrinsic
stains is out there call like stains
that are like embedded into your teeth
not just like surface stains of like
candy that you just say so that's why
we're gonna brush your teeth but we just
thought it would be fun to eat candy
first you can see how it's colored our
teeth good luck PS you guys like my
t-shirt that I got from zara cranberry
juice oh yeah we could go on the healthy
route and what's more fun beef or candy
Oh should this isn't that blue I thought
this was a blue ring pop and it's kind
of green but that's okay my I'm is candy
let me see me make a new teeth bed
are your mouth your thumb a little maybe
Holly one of those make my mouth had it
was just done between your teeth my ring
pop didn't work out too well because it
was kind of greenish we just had a bunch
of red cherry bolts and they made our
mouse like a little red I don't know if
he can even tell but they did they're
more color than they were before now
we're gonna go brush our teeth so we can
try out our teeth whitening system to
let's go found a vibrator they'd want is
to ya so there must be good oh this is
the result after we have brushed our
teeth I feel like our teeth or that
yellow but they're not that white an
Oreo I majorities but I've never waiting
my teeth before and also and i have also
Lucy was born your teeth weren't fully
developed when you were born so she's
had like I didn't have wicked mammal her
teeth are like less white that's why so
first we're gonna put the gel into the
tray in this try i don't believe
hopefully i'm not doing it wrong but i
don't believe you mold this once your
mouth I've done some before where you
actually have to like boil it and mold
it to ralphs and stuff and that gets
tricky but I don't think you have to for
this one which is like my split
convenient so Lucy's been watching me do
it first because I've done like teeth
whitening before and then you can belong
so I think with this one you just put
like a thin layer of gel on the top and
on the bottom so it gets your top teeth
and your bottom teeth obviously you just
go like this
you don't have to whisper she goes if
it's only on the bottom of the try how
is it getting it up to your teeth and
what happens where did you put it in and
you like bite down it like it's tight
and squishes to your teeth and then all
the gel will come up in front of your
teeth so it gets like the bottom and the
front just wanna make sure you have a
thin like even layer 110 3 we just
rinsed out our mouth if you could tell
was funny because he couldn't really
talk like with them entirely forgot that
we would be able to talk with him in so
this is being really funny and was just
Jimmy at to music overall my teeth
definitely wider and years definitely do
20 like new noticeably than before and
also this one I know is a more the
gradual system like I said before it's
like work event its use it for the two
or three months and then you notice a
really big difference but like it's
gradual from time to time because you
don't want like damage your teeth let's
do a little comparison to see who wins
so I think you must know arson was a
different though like I feel like before
mine were like noticeably wider but I
think yours almost got more wetter than
mine because they were like less weight
to be admitted that make sense but I
think we both definitely improved who do
you think wins ah but yours got whiter
too so it's okay yes this is funny that
is just our faces let's just continue
filming the video like this it keeps
focusing on pictures behind us okay
there we go this is like a really fun
video to film did you have fun yeah ooh
that was my neck here getting the frame
or this is so funny it's just our bases
but yeah you guys had fun watching this
video and enjoyed it definitely give us
a big thumbs up if you enjoyed like I
said the teeth what you thinkin that we
use will be linked down below so you can
check it out if you want I hope you guys
have a great day and I'll see you in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
