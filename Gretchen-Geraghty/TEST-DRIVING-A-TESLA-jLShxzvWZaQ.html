why is it snowing legit why it's April I
feel like my throat is like that - I've
been taking vitamins and stuff we have
Trader Joe's oh you're happy it's
snowing yeah yeah she was pretty good
actually they don't care about why to
say they care about me you have to say
YUM didn't our tailor has to go to
athletic training and then we're gonna
get our nails done and bam test-driving
and Tesla oh yeah wait you think I'm
gonna be able to the snow I don't let
you drive with that Oh tillers like why
are they gonna let you drive Tesla but
um basically I just had to sign up I
didn't have to but I signed up to
testify at Tesla because Amy is doing a
project on Tesla and she wanted to test
drive a Tesla it's like talk about it
but she's in the 21 so she can't and I
just turned 21 so I can so she was just
gonna come with me Angele
and I know one of the Tesla people that
come with you something you don't like
Rashmi stuff but it doesn't look like
the snow sticking so hopefully I still
can but that's a way of it's gonna be
this snow is so like thick does that
make sense it gets like big chunks of
snow I'm stressed
so I'm going back up from the gym I'd
have been a quick workout I just was
totally kidding because I'm like tired
and I always forget getting sick but
it's like snowing you called Imogen how
much time so many excuses but like
something is better than nothing you
know that's how I think about things I
mean - I'm gonna go get me Alison right
now I got to eat breakfast
probably like open ocean thing a shower
oh my gosh that's at 12:58 tonight who's
your date your market here we are
I was still snowing me and Taylor I want
to get your nails done
me too I'm so excited
hello we're about to go test drive our
Tesla I want to vlog in class and I got
scared like would that be scary oh I did
it last thing I showed was my nose but I
just made chicken salad and now I'm
eating popcorn looks like a oh there's
popcorn show bit around z Maggie and
they were eating skinny pop well now
this is gonna remind me of you because
you liked it too
we were just saying how we're never said
I'm gonna kill us in the Tesla yeah I
feel like I don't think I could do that
I mean dude I'm sure the guy yeah I'm
sure the guy will like lead us through
it though and amy was gonna vlog on her
phone because that way we don't know for
a lab to blog and that way it'll be
ready to try to get some video oh yeah
good hi cookie I think I had that robe
in my lifetime like when I was younger
to her yeah you'll be okay yeah the fuck
the followers love you I will loo have
you been in the vlog really well here's
number three so my threes in there okay
ty what do you have to tell them wait I
don't look now a cup like that now I was
inspired
little a few moments later hey guys we
found out I can't even test drive you
have to be 25 so we're just gonna ride
with the driver yeah but I side up and
they took my driver am I getting my face
but I signed up in
that's our building that's really really
yeah very tall I like
John's really pretty
three design studio is only available to
people that have reservation so about
six weeks before your car gets goes into
production you're invited to the design
studio and then you can like go through
and pick like your color and that's
tough
that is so trippy I would never get over
about to no steering wheel turn without
yourself that was so fun oh basically oh
I kind of said it on my feelings but
they wouldn't let me actually drive it
because you have to be 25 just at this
location is not focusing petty good but
they say they just get so many people
and like the Prudential location that
they have to like filter the amount of
people just by how old you are so you
have to be at least that's also weirdly
to be at least 21 just like sit in the
passenger seat then but luckily I was
and then I'm 20 alone yeah they let you
in the back beta where is okay but at
other locations you can be 21 to drive
but at this one you have to be 25 so
maybe was a little died on her neck or
something yeah that was so funny I just
can't get over how quiet it was yeah
any little thing we saw model 3 on the
highway yeah and she was like 6 in box
yeah and she said the waiting list is a
year and a half
can you imagine and she's like there's
over like half a million people that
have already bought a Tesla that hasn't
even been made for them yet
like what that's wild and they let the
Tesla car door handles go like right as
you lock the car they like go into the
door so I'm like no one can even like
break in excited try maybe someone could
like smash through the window but I and
if it's plugged in you can't drive away
because it's plugged in and the plug
gets locked into the car too
like so many little things I don't even
think about it was so cool and I got
some footage at the end yeah it parked
itself oh yeah that was the people we've
ever seen so and it was like the park
where you like perpendicular Park is
that what it's called yeah it like
drives past minute it backs up into it I
can't even do that Park I tried once and
it was awful but
because I'm sure everyone heard about
the guy that died I was gonna ask him
and I was like yeah better not help
spine I've never been in a Tesla before
it was a great experience what else is
cool oh it senses all the cars around
you oh and what I didn't know at all
meeting me didn't know this you
literally don't hit the brakes like ever
yeah yeah um because it breaks by itself
and you really only need to break
yourself if you're like stopping at a
stoplight she said are like we like we
were going down the hill in the parking
garage and we were pulling out and she
like had her foot on the accelerator but
it was still breaking because it knows
that it should break but isn't that so
cool okay me too
I just feel like the world that our kids
grow up in is gonna be so different than
the one that we grew up in I mean it
always it is from generation to
generation yeah but like the cars that
they learned to drive in is gonna be
like that kind of car and not like the
cars we learn to drive in and he saved
so much money because she said that like
if you charge like once a week like this
charge is like eight or ten dollars but
then getting like a full tank of gas
you know she understating money because
I was like wait if you get a power
station on your house you're gonna be
spending some it's more money on your
like electric bill right that's what it
would be issues like yeah but you saved
me and Gaston anyway that was cool
honey we're home I never come to this
location the Prudential I've been here
one
then you really like oh like just spring
one maybe I'll get a new one change
wait yeah oh wait they did lentil and
avocado look so bad yeah I always go to
the boylston one or the
but during recovery when I went through
men we went to this one every single day
he like had to eat every school that air
there is no today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
