so bad right now we look really funny if
you guys know Lucy and me and now mkhaya
- because Lucy introduced her to it we
are obsessed with loose delmar like we
literally love them they're so amazing
and people a lot of people I feel like
don't know that when they hear loose
somewhere and they don't know who it is
they just think it's like one person but
like no it's like a duo pretty much
except it when they perform it's like
more than just standing back - no they
have like yeah there's one guy's name is
you Nick I don't know their names but
whatever mainly it's like Max and Danny
and Max and Danny of you see this love
you you are the things you're the best
but anyway so Danny reached out to me on
Instagram because I talked to Matt for
their concert and I was like listening
guys so you know like me my twin sister
our little obsessive ear like music and
like now all our friends are - I was
looking at this YouTube channel make so
many my followers have been listening to

me so happy and if you love their music
as much as we do like I love you and

lose the Lucy is so good thank you
maybe I'll make this its own video
yeah probably why not I mean this is
pretty big I should just do it guys this
is gonna be its own video thank you and
for those of you that like I feel like I
didn't give it a background now
that I said this is his own dedicated
thing um for those of you I don't know
that who lose Tamara's basically they're
just this amazing band and I'll give you
some backstory I think Lucy found out
who they were
through Spotify she just found and I'm
like fell in love with her music and
this was like last year and she's
showing me their music and we like loved
it and then this is funny I'll just tell
you some really quick story their first
time they came to Boston Lucy was like
Peter Pan so excited and me and her both
got tickets and it was at this small
like bar I want to say I'm like right
near campus - we literally walked there
but the day before the concert I lost my
wallet and like that so the the venue
was 18 and over and I was like oh who
see no big deal like it'll be fine like
they're not gonna be that strict like
I'll have my um college like the UID
like it's gonna be fine and we get in
and there's a sign on the door it's like
passports or government-issued ID only
and I was like Lucy chill like it's okay
she's like you're not gonna get in where
I can be able to go like I'm gonna be so
sad like she was like already getting
angry that I wouldn't be able to go
before I couldn't even get in I'm like
chilling it's gonna be part
everything works itself out and like the
bouncer dude this big guy and he's like
okay I D he's not a can of my Bui D and
he's like oh no like do you have like
your license and I was like no he's a
gir passport I was like no like I'm
sorry like I just don't have it with me
I actually lost my well like I don't
have my driver's license and here's like
I'm really sorry there's nothing we can
do and as I kept bro like you don't
understand like we're twins like this is
fine like I'm 19 like I really am 19 and
he was like no like sweetie like no and
I'm like um maybe my parents haven't
sent me a picture of my passport and he
was like no and Lucy was so mad at me I
didn't have it down for a while and then
luckily they added a new show only a
couple months later over the summer in
Albany which is like right near where
Lucy now from so we went there so they
like and they're breaking up so their
Instagram I'll have a link down below
of--they and I'll have their website
with like two or days and stuff because
if they're coming near you go listen
them and even if you haven't listened to
a song before like how can you not like
their music like how could you not like
it is just happy music it makes me like
feel good I mean like it's just I love
it I love it they're like really really
good like so into it max is so happy
just like killing it on the drone and oh
yeah like I get to describe your music
in my head it's sort of like indie but
that does not encompass all that they're
about like there's so much more about it
it's just so good and it's almost like a
little bit wrong and I know they said
they're both inspired a little bit like
like Latino because I know they both
like a studied Spanish and like had like
fruits anyway oh and if you're wondering
fun fact
what the name of their band is from
Lewis was the name of both of their dads
did you remember that cuz I member alex
spence we're like why is it like Louis
tomorrow they're gonna watch this and be
like they're so creepy abut we just love
you guys it's okay
I think Telmar I forget it Oshin yeah
but like why do they say that that was
like important to them there was like a
significance behind it or something I
think it was just because like they live
by the ocean
and like yeah it was like that where
where they live in their bungalow and
everything it's like really close to the
shore and they like oh yeah yeah like
emerging racemic I have watched like all
of their like Facebook live say you feel
like read all these articles ever like
some articles because I just love them
but basically of all their stuff link
down below I love their music it's
really great and I feel so lucky them in
position to like spread their music with
you guys and have like an audience to
share them with and share my like
favorite artists with because I'm it's
just so exciting and really fun I think
so
I guess that is all nice and dandy again
if you're watching this I love you thank
you guys so much and when you come back
to the East Coast you know you know
we'll be there because we will Makai
little fly out from California to watch
like she always but um yeah okay this

normal and it very casual and just like
this so it's going on right now
