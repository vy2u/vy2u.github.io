say thank you thank you so so much you
have no idea like my mind is like going
crazy right now I honestly cannot
believe it I'm just here say thank you
so so much for everything one of those
things is I just say a hundred thousand
subscribers can be even fathom this
right now because I sure can't like
100,000 people can you just like think
about that for a second because like
what is 100,000 people I can't even
think about it like 100,000 human beings
have seen my channel subscribe like
watch some videos like I can I can't
even imagine I haven't even been on
YouTube that wrong I feel like I just
started like the end of my freshman year
I like oh I can't even believe it like I
can't like 100,000 people oh my gosh i
still remember when i hit 1000
subscribers and I was like holy moly
look I don't even know 1,000 people and
a thousand people have seen my videos in
100,000 like can we just take one moment
I oh I'm sorry I'm being knowing I just
can't believe it and I can't wait to put
out more like material for you guys and
just all you're so amazing you don't
understand like YouTube is my life and I
just makes my day when you guys like
message me and tweet at me and commented
sweetest things ever like whoa I just
I'm gonna start crying I honestly think
i'll be starting I tears my eyes and I'm
holding the bag and I can't believe it
like 100,000 subscribers whoa okay Wow
more than that I want to take a separate
video about this I thought I would just
put it right in here recently a girl my
rowing team cristianos Swedish human
being on planet literally such a nice
girl she contacted a bunch of you
actually and made a video for me as a
senior gift when she first showed it to
me I just had no words I like honestly
stopped breathing and I was like oh my
gosh and I just started crying
I couldn't believe it because the video
to started playing it was like we love
you Gretchen and I was like oh my gosh
like how did this even happen and
Christian ax worked so hard on
contacting a bunch of you and all of you
that worked with her and we're like so
pleasant like thank you so much you
can't even realize and how much it means
to me I probably watch the video that
she made me of you guys I would say more
than 50 times I watched it so much and I
just sit there and I'm like oh my gosh
oh my gosh like because I don't think
you guys understand like I'm YouTube
like people that make youtube videos I
understand I making videos of myself and
they're going on the internet and I can
see that they have like a thousand views
or 100,000 views or 100,000 subscribers
like I can see that people are watching
them but I don't see the people that are
watching them and I can't really see
your reaction look I get your comments I
get your messages your feedback like all
that but I never really get to like see
the people sometimes I get to meet you
which is like the best thing in the
world I've already said like how much I
loved meeting you guys so much of
meeting subscribers my favorite thing
ever but I don't get to see a lot of you
so you're seeing this video of your
faces like saying how you love me and
how I look inspired your legs honestly
like I just oh my gosh like I just could
not believe it and it's truly amazing
that I've inspired you in some of the
ways that you guys said it's so crazy to
me I never would have thought that I
ever would have been here ever a lot of
you know I started off up in ninth grade
just for fun like my friend had showed
me makeup videos and I was like that is
the coolest thing ever like if you're
not gonna make them i will and i just
started making them for fun and i never
thought i would keep making them for as
long as I have and it would grow into
what it has now and it is honestly my
life like I walk through the hallways at
school people like GLD what's up so
literally if that is my life now which
is so awesome like I love it that video
that gift that I have received is so
crazy along with hitting 100,000
subscribers like that is a huge
benchmark in my life
just can't believe it like oh you guys
are amazing i will also put in some
clips of the video that shadow put
together for me and it's a lot of you
just say like why you love me and how I
inspire you I'm not going to play the
whole thing because I think the whole
thing are is around like seven minutes
long so I don't wanna put the whole
thing in here and also some of it's a
little bit personal like some people say
like how it helped you through a
difficult situation so I wouldn't want
to like broadcast that on the internet
if you don't want that on there but i
think i'll put in like a couple clips
you guys can see that i could get your
videos i did see all of your footage and
it means the world to me like those of
you especially that took the time out of
your day to go film a video of yourself
saying how I've inspired you and why you
love me like I just feel so loved and it
is like the best feeling ever it's just
so overwhelming like 100,000 people that
is like six digits in a row whoa I'm
just so excited and I can't wait for it
to come with all my future endeavors and
videos and a bunch of you probably
realize what does 100,000 subscribers me
it means a Richter I promises a while
ago I said you guys if and when I hit
100,000 subscribers I was in the room to
her well guys the time has arrived
100,000 subscribers have come so i'm
thinking i will fail my room tour in the
next few days and it can get it right up
for you guys you can see that because i
know that has literally been requested
since my first day on youtube ever so i
won't finally finally do a room tour
right before i go up to college youtube
has impacted the person I am and who
I've become so much like it's helping my
confidence and just how I like approach
life and look at things and just having
like this big support network behind me
just makes it all worth it and I'm now
I'm going to keep making YouTube videos
in college and like it's so amazing some
of the opportunities I've gotten it
companies have i've been able to work
with because of YouTube is like so mine
and it's all because of you guys and I
can't thank you enough for just watching
my videos like I just love you all so
