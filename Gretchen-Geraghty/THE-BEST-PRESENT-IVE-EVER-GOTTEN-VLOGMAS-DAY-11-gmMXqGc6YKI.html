felt like chicken running around with my
head cut off today and I slept - like 12
- so it's only like 7 hours into my day
it's not that way for me
and look what I just made for dinner I'm
so excited
I always made some labels if I don't
have them for the couple days and I just
made it this really massive one and I
put it in a really big bowl too so I
could put a lot of toppings on anything
except chocolate and in my pajama outfit
that I wear literally every day I miss
phosphate wool is just so good a big
reason I'm making this video as well as
I thought it would help my throat you
can tell I've always like on you guys

I hate it so much I'd like I do
everything I can I try to not get sick
I've been seeing hydrated I've been
sleeping enough I've been taking vitamin

last night my throat's hurting in today
my lymph nodes are swollen oh my god I
don't know if he'd be tall but like my
limit oh there's one I was about to go
for a run and then I was like probably
shouldn't exercise if I'm feeling sick
already in a way Harry snores oh I don't
to be sick in travel annoys makes me
sick so I'm upset right now but I
thought what else can I do like I was
taking my hair for a while because the
doctor said I was like a little bit of
meemic guy literally do with a hydrate I
have electrolytes sometimes probably not
as much as I should I should get more
Pedialyte with Gatorade but I don't know
