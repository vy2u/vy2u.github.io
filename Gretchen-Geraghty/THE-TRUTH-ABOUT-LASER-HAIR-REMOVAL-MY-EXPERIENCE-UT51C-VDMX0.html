film this little girl talk video with
you guys because I remember last summer
I made a video about these are hair
removal and I wanted to give you guys an
update on how that went for me and just
give you a lot of more information about
it because I've actually done a lot of
requests for me on blogs I've just been
posting recently people were like hey
didn't you do laser hair removal like
can you give us an update on that so I
just figured it'd make sense it's make a
whole nother video about it almost a
year later just telling you how it went
for me and just some more details about
it in general sorry I finally make it in
this video too so I'm writing this slow
strapless shirt I just got
I love it but anyway so if you guys
didn't know if you did watch my first
video I did get laser hair removal from
laser away on my bikini area and on my
underarms and I could not be more happy
about it it was honestly one of the best
decisions I ever made and I remember
saying that in my first video about it
after I only had one session basically
if you have no idea laser hair removal
is it's a way of removing hair on your
body but it's a lot more permanent and
long-lasting than something like shaving
or waxing and I was never really a huge
fan of shaving or waxing because shaving
is just so annoying it takes up so much
time you get like razor bumps I always
hated those in waxing I only actually
got on my eyebrows a couple times
because I just couldn't deal with the
pain it hurts so bad I would get like
rashes on my eyebrows and it was just
kind of horrible so I do I did not want
to deal with waxing it also like my
underarms or bikini area I knew that
would be so painful and I'm so happy I
tried out laseraway because yeah I just
had the best results from it and I
remember thinking this is my other video
- I'm not like an expert so I don't
really know but basically I think what
the laser does is it kind of like kills
the hair follicle so if the hair that
was there will fall out and it won't
grow back and typically I remember
seeing in the other video - I think I
said it's like five to six sessions as
normal and I think for most people it's
like six to eight but for me I only went
six times and that was like totally fine
because it works the best are people
that are pale and have dark hair and
actually I'm pretty pale right now I'm
kinda chances of summer but we get laser
hair removal you're not tanned at all
you have to be completely like without
sun exposure because that just works the
best and then also that way the laser
can't burn you so you want to make sure
you have like no it's not exposure at
all sorry the lighting
weird right now Suns going down okay
sorry I just like readjusted I didn't
want that big seven spot in my face but
yeah I think you just worked really well
for me it starting to my skin was so
pale when I was doing it and my hair is
actually pretty dark and I think if you
have like blonde hair red hair gray hair
it won't really work as best for you but
you can just kind of talk with them and
I think with other types of lasers that
they can use but I know just working
those four pails came too dark hair so
remember the first time I went I said
that bikini actually hurt a lot less
than my underarms and then for my
underarms only one hurt and then the
other one didn't so that was so random
and then I would say each progressive
time like going second time third time
fourth time fifth time sixth time it
wasn't as bad as the first because even
though the laser strength goes up each
appointment to have better results I
actually noticed that it hurt less
because there is less hair that grows
back so there's like less laser
treatment that actually has to happen if
that makes sense
and also the appointments are so so
quick like I would be in and out in 15
minutes and that was really two areas so
it was so quick and so worth it and I
remember mentioning this in the last one
so I'm kind of going over this more
briefly and if you guys want to see that
video where I kind of explain like
waxing and shaving more in detail if you
kind of have no idea about any of it
I'll have that video linked up below and
I'm also gonna have a laser light went
down below so you guys can check out
their website and see like pricing and
everything and although I know it is
expensive I think it's so worth it
because it just saves you so much time
and I remember even after the first time
I saw results especially on my underarms
I just noticed that a lot less was
growing back and now like barely any
grows back at all and my armpits my
bikini area and I'm not gonna say that
it's a hundred percent gone because
there will be like one or two hairs but
like obviously that's way better than
having like all of the hair that was
there before you know what I mean and I
would say also I think I noticed better
results in my bikini areas my underarms
and I'm thinking maybe that's because
your armpits get more sun exposure than
your bikini area like it's like your
bikini area never would really get some
exposure and let's go Janet that baby
bottoms on you really have to be careful
about sun exposure like I mentioned
before because the laser can burn you if
your skin is tanned and I'm at one point
when I got my laser treatment I knew
that I was going to be going on vacation
or was right after I'm on vacation or
something and they're like just make
sure you like cover up the top of your
thighs if the line of where your bikini
area is because you don't want that to
get burned and I remember going into it
thinking that it was going to be so
painful and it honestly was about at all
also I was trying to look back on
questions on my first video to see if I
could answer any other questions you
guys had and someone asks were you like
uncomfortable with the technician at all
or maybe like with your bikini area and
honestly I'm typically a pretty
comfortable person I must say but I was
totally comfortable all six times I went
like I literally just like chatting with
the technician the whole time and I had
even one girl say like wow like you
don't seem like you're like a panel and
I'm like I'm really not and it's like
for me talking to someone makes me kind
of distracted so I literally just have
conversations with them throughout the
whole process because they would just
make me feel more comfortable and make
me not kind of focus on the pain and I
would be like distracted you know and
they're still professionals I'll answer
all your questions they're so helpful
I remember like asking so many things
about when I could have sun exposure
before and after and like how to treat
it after it's painful at all and I know
like I said razor bumps are so horrible
and you can have laser bumps but I think
I have them like one time I remember I
think it's after the fifth time I don't
really know why but I have them for one
day and they were gone the next day so
it's like totally fine and literally
just so so worth it like going a month
without shaving your armpits and having
them be like there is like kind of the
best thing ever and not having to worry
about it I especially feel like my
underarms would get so like sensitive
and you know you're shaving them all the
time in the summer and they would just
have like so many bumps it's up so
there's not have initiated
it's just like that dream come true Oh
highly highly hardly to recommend
nothing but a great experience with them
and what's funny is now I'm living in
New York City for the summer you guys
know and the LEAs are away I go to is in
York City I know they look a bunch of
locations on the west coast but then I
think they only have the one in New York
City and when I went from last summer
all the way through my school year at BU
I'd have to travel from Austin to New
York in New York back to Austin every
single time and of course once I'm done
now I'm living in the city where it's
like a couple blocks away like it's so
funny yeah basically if you guys have
any questions leave them down below yeah
this is really helpful for you guys
because I saw one other video saying
that it's nice like how open I am and
stuff you guys know and they're like an
open personal person so I don't really
mind talking about this and you guys
want any other videos that are a little
bit more personal bigger requests down
below because I really just don't mind
consider you all friends we're all
friends here right ladies so yeah thank
you so much for watching this video and
I'll see you next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
