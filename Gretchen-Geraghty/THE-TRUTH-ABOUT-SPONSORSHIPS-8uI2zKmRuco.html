of different type of video different
than like most of my videos and it's
basically just to acknowledge is one
topic that has really been bothering me
lately I just really felt like I had to
address this because it's been popping
up at a lot of my comments recently
think it's just this big thing that
subscribers and viewers think about when
they watch different creators videos and
I just kind of wanted to like lay out
some facts in like just completely tell
you guys about it in the topic of this
video is just sponsorships and for those
of you that don't know what sponsorships
are there basically German companies
will reach out to different youtubers or
on any platform really look I know you
can have like Instagram sponsorships and
like maybe blog ones I don't have a blog
so i don't really know companies will
like reach out to these creators and say
like hey we have this product we think
that you'd be interested in and maybe
your viewers and like we can give it to
you sometimes they'll pay you and you
can share with your viewers so i know a
lot of time subscribers and viewers get
really angry with sponsorships when they
feel like creators aren't being like one
hundred percent honest or like our kind
of misleading them and i just want to
tell you guys about me personally and
how I deal of sponsorships because it
makes me really upset when people
comment like oh she's just doing this
for the money or like wow this is
totally sponsored because oh that really
irks me I would like so hard on my
videos this is my job I take it so
seriously so I'm just gonna tell you how
it is I run to my phone some things to
keep me on track because I feel like
this is a rant and I'm just going to get
totally sidetracked it so I just wrote
some things on here also I'm really
sorry it's like night time it's monday
i'm willing to be trying to get up this
video like tonight because it's just
really been on my mind I just gotta get
my voice out there yeah I just got back
from working out i like just put my hair
out of my ponytail I'm like all sweaty
I'm wearing a raincoat so sorry for my
appearance but I just got to tell you
how I feel first thing I wrote I'm
always one hundred percent honest when
i'm doing sponsored videos i cannot even
tell you guys the things i promote are
truly things that i think you'd be
interested in it'll never talk about a
product in a way that i don't really
feel when i tell you guys about a
certain product is because i'm being
like totally one hundred percent honest
about it and that's how i feel about it
I'm
excited about it I thought you guys
would be interested in it I can't tell
you how many times companies that really
have nothing to do with like a fashion
or beauty or like Lifestyle channel like
mine for example this one time a kitchen
spice like like food cooking Spice
Company reached out to me and we're like
hey well like pay you a bunch of money
and like central these spices that you
can like show off on your channel and
I'm like really like this is nothing to
my channel I am not in it for the money
I actually just got an email today it
said they would pay me a thousand
dollars to talk about this new like
coffee line I don't like coffee i
personally don't drink it so i'm not
going to be talking about that on my
channel i could have thrown it into one
of my videos but I'm not for that like i
said i only talk about things that i use
i enjoy and I think you guys would like
to so when people are like this is toe
sponsors like she's just getting paid
like oh my gosh guys if i ever i'm doing
a sponsored video it's because i've
truly tried it out for a long time i
really like it I've seen the benefits
and I think that you guys would benefit
from it too that's that I write down I
really try out the products that use
them because the best is when companies
that I've already tried out and use
their products contact me because I'm
like yes I've always loved your products
and it's great but also for those of you
that are youtubers you know like new
startup companies will contact you
sometimes because they want to get their
products out there and I totally
understand that so sometimes they'll
send me products and I'll try them out
for like a month I'll try them out for a
really long time to really try to gather
my opinion on it and see if I really
like it and it's something that I think
my subscribers would be interested in
and I would say more often than not I
tell them honestly and straight up
listen I really didn't like this I
remember this happen with like some face
masks I was trying out I was like
honestly like it made my skin oily I
really didn't like it I'm choosing not
to show it on my channel and they're
usually pretty okay with that and look
oh sorry that you don't enjoy them like
whatever and it's okay so a lot of times
I don't show products that i don't like
I'm very honest with you guys like i
said but then if i am trying out
products and i do like them and i choose
to share them with you guys then i will
do that and a lot of times i won't get
paid for products that i'm showing you
guys look if i'm showing you something
and i'm really talking highly about it a
lot of times I feel like people jump to
conclusions and they're like oh this is
sponsored like she's definitely getting
paid for this like I would say more
often than not i'm not getting paid for
it and if it's something that i really
like I'm just passionate about it and my
listen this is so great like I'm gonna
let you down below so you can check it
out because I honestly want to like help
you guys and I think you're going to
benefit from it then that's that look
for example this face brush that I
talked about in my boyfriend versus
girlfriend morning routine if you guys
just saw that video I was so excited to
show you guys that like I've been trying
it out for the past month and I've been
obsessed with it like seriously my skin
has never been this good I know the
lighting isn't really good right now
it's like night time but seriously my
skin has never been this good and I owe
it all to that face brush so the fact
that i showed it my morning routine
because i was so excited to share it
with you guys and then for some of you
to be oh this is totally sponsored like
oh my god it breaks my heart because i
was so excited to like show you guys
this face brush this thing is like my
holy grail like it's what is making my
skin live and then for you guys to like
tear me apart be like this is your
sponsored like no like this video right
now it's not getting sponsored for them
for example and i'm telling you guys how
much i love their face brush so like you
know what I mean okay if you wanted me
to i'll link it down below like i said
this isn't sponsored but you can go
check it out and look at the face brush
that I love and that's changing my life
because isn't that even the point of
view to buck I'm just trying to share
with you guys my knowledge and what I
like because I think that you will like
it and it'll be beneficial for you Oh
like you see what I mean guys that know
me know that my favorite color is purple
and his face brush has all these
different colors and I freaking got a
purple one and it makes me so happy and
when I wake up in the morning and I wash
my face with it and it's purple it just
makes me happy so it's the little things
guys okay sorry this video is all over
the place but that is just how I feel
also I really focus on the products that
I think you guys will like a and most of
the time I just judge that based on do I
really like this product to I really
enjoy using it because I know most of
you are around my summer older summer
younger obviously and most of you are
girls there are the occasional like
voyagers but if i look at bi analytics
on youtube i'm pretty sure like
ninety-five percent my viewers or girls
so a lot of the things I talk about
pertaining to girls they can two boys to
like beauty and fashion and stuff so I
really try to focus on the things that i
like because I'm like okay you guys
would like them to I talk about
swimsuits lot I talk about makeup I
shocked about hair talk about skin
beauty if I really like them then I
would think that you would like them to
I'm not gonna like be promoting
something that I don't even believe in
you know not to say that there aren't
youtubers out there that do that because
you
must be like thinking these things from
somewhere like certainly there must be
some youtubers are honest truthful out
there and are just doing it for the
money for sponsorships but I'm telling
you that's not me I think I touched on
this before but I don't always get paid
if I'm talking about a brand or if I'm
talking about a product that I really
like and I'm just telling you that i
love it i include a link down below so
you guys can check it out like I'm not
always getting paid once in a while if
I'm lucky enough for the company to
reach out to me to offer to pay for me
to show one of my favorite products in a
video like that is like a win-win for me
for you guys for everyone because
YouTube is my job and like college isn't
cheap so like if i can get sponsored
videos for products that i love and i
know you guys love to it's great but
that doesn't happen all the time most of
my videos aren't sponsored i guess the
last thing I just want to touch on is
I'm really not in it for the money even
if others are because you guys must be
thinking these things from somewhere
like I said before there's got to be
youtubers out there that are doing
sponsorships for the money and I think
it's blatantly obvious because sometimes
like i said if i were to promote right
now spices for cooking in the kitchen
you would be like what the heck wretched
you have a fashion and beauty and like
Lifestyle channel that has nothing to do
with cooking like what have you ever
talked about cooking like all right
maybe the occasional like peanut butter
and banana because they know that's like
all i eat but like I'm not gonna be like
cooking a four-course meal with like
spices you know what I mean I think
that's an even tell when someone's
really selling out and they're really
just like doing it for the money but
yeah that's not me which is the whole
point in this video I didn't even
mention my hair care routine which I was
so excited to film for you guys me and
my roommate makhaya tried out as shampoo
and conditioner and like hair products
for like a month every day she wasn't oh
my god garching these smell so good my
hair's been so soft I'm like me too i
love it so it's so excited to film that
video with her and like try out those
products and stuff mind you I did not
get paid for that video i would simply
sent those products to try out because
they were like new products want to try
and I was like sure I will and we love
them like I would probably go by that
shampoo and conditioner again I didn't
get paid for that video some people were
like this is so sponsored I want to see
what you actually do I'm telling you
guys that is what I actually do so for
those of you that said I want to see
your real hair care routine that was my
real hair care routine like my hair is
looking like this it's gotten a lot
longer because I changed my shampoo and
conditioner all the time so that was
just what I was using that
I literally use every single branch
essbase Gloria like literally every
brand I'm I don't stick to the same
thing so that was one hundred percent my
hair care routine because I always
change my shampoo and conditioner so sad
that a lot of people said that it was
sponsored and that I wanted to just see
my real hair care routine oh the things
that irk me sorry this video is all over
the place I hope I defend any of you i
hope i got out everything that I've just
been feeling but it just makes me really
upset when people complain about
sponsorships when a lot of times my
videos aren't sponsored and I just want
to like share with you guys things that
I like and people automatically think
that they're sponsored or that i'm
getting paid a lot of money like no I'm
not really hope I got all my thoughts
that I wanted to out there and I hope if
i fended you you can forgive me I really
hope I didn't offend any of you I just
wanted to like tell you how I'm feeling
I worked so hard on YouTube guys I like
love it it is like the best thing in the
world and I never knew that it would
turn into my job and like turn into the
opportunities that it has I'm like so
grateful and I love it and I would never
take advantage of you guys like I'm a
hundred percent honest so this is me
right here telling you if that I'm
honest and open with you guys so yeah I
think that is all I have to say if I
didn't mention before I'm actually my
friend Taylor's right out filming
because crooms really pretty it has a
good background also i'm getting over
being sick right now if you're wondering
why I sound like congested like this I
love you guys so so much and I'll see
you in my next video alright i hope none
of you hate me for this video because i
still love you sorry i had to be so
serious i've just been really upset
lately</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
