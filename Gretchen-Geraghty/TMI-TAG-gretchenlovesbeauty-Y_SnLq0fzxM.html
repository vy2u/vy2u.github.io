TMI tag this one around like a long time
ago some of you have requested me to do
it and I also have a lot of requests for
like other like more popular videos
which I want to do I just gotta have the
time to do it so right is it hit summer
and like I get rid of like finals are
over I'll have more time to film really
good videos like routines and tours and
collections and all that um you're
probably wondering what are those
dresses those are prom dresses because
tis the season what can I say here we go
question 1 what are you wearing well
YouTube I'm wearing this black
long-sleeved dress from brandy melville
and my hair isn't this low bun thingy
and there's a braid can you even tell
it's probably messy cuz it went up a
long time ago but I made my twin sister
braiding I know I keep saying this what
I really really really will film a
fitness routine I have one from a long
time ago but I need like an updated once
you I can't promise one but see
shouldn't you ever been in love yes I
have been in love 3 ever had a terrible
breakup no how tall are you
I'm 5 foot 8 how much do you weigh I
mean is that like your desire I guess
I'll just tell you I usually 127 like
126 on a good day so it's like normal
any piercings I'm just my ears you but I
really want my belly button pierced OTP
um like a cute couple
I think that's what that means I just
thought endless love and it was like the
cutest thing ever the entire movie I was
like stop this is so good so the two
people in endless look even they're
probably not dating in real life but
yeah favorite show I haven't watched a
good show and like a really long time I
used to like love Grey's Anatomy I'll
talk about that but I have no time to
like watch TV I just watched Pretty
Little Liars but I don't even watch that
anymore so I don't really know what my
favorite show would be favorite bands
this is a really good question I don't
know I this isn't like my sister's music
maybe like the paper kites something you
miss I miss my dead dog and my dead cat
in my dead grandfather sorry I thought
was like really sad but I just miss dead
things
favorite song this one's really like
stumping me oh I've always thought that
song that my friend Amelia should we
last you marry the see it's in a video
that I have I think it's my like Brandi
lookbook I'll link it down below but
it's playing in there yeah I really like
that song where the sea
how old are you I'm 17 years old oh I
almost you said 16 to that like I was 16
zodiac sign I was born March 11th so I'm
a Pisces is that what a zodiac sign is
oh my gosh don't kill me
quality you look for in a partner
someone that's nice to you which
definitely treats you well oh my god
girls that put up with boys that treat
them like crap I can't even take it it
makes me so angry so first off someone
that treats you well it's someone that's
just like nice and fun to be with like
willing to try things that you want to
do like yeah I don't know someone that's
honest I'm in this loyal definitely yeah
oil tea is a big thing
favorite actor oh my god I know my
favorite actor hands down whoa Channing
Tatum favorites color all these
questions are hard for me like why
Gretchen why blue purple my room is
purple but I like my sister's room I'm
filming it all the time this is Lucy's
room it's blue I like wearing white
because it makes me feel tan but yeah I
don't know I don't know if I have a
favorite color I didn't like a lot of
colors loud music or soft music
definitely loud where do you go in your
sad uh usually I come running through
the bathroom into here to talk to Lucy
because she copes with my craziness how
long does it take you to shower
a typical shower for me is mostly 15
minutes how long does it take you to get
ready in the morning you so take me way
longer but now it's like literally 20
minutes cuz I'm lazy and wanna sleep
ever been in a physical fight like I was
seen I like a wrestle before and
fighting stuff by the way she can beat
me up cuz she's really strong but not
like a real physical fight no can you
see me in a physical fight guys now turn
on OH
when someone's really nice and funny
yeah turn off
when someone's just like mean to you
when they can get funny and like it's
annoying
yeah the reason I joined YouTube I don't
know I just thought it was really
interesting and I like saw videos and I
was like whoa look what even is that guy
just thought it was so interesting I was
like that is so cool like I didn't even
know they existed and then I was like I
don't wanna do it like why not and so I
just thought it was really cool fears
you know those movies them they're stuck
in like a rock cave and the water is
like filling up and they're like you
know they're like sucking for air like
in the Titanic that happens when they're
sinking they're like the air so that's
probably my biggest fear would be like
drowning like but you like know what's
happening like it's like you're
anticipating to drown last thing that
made you cry guys I think you
underestimate how much I cry I literally
cry all the time like oh um Fault in Our
Stars that's coming out I was sitting
with you guys today and the free you
came out and I started bawling like a
denieth anything and everything makes me
sad and emotional like I cry all the
time I probably cry once a week about
school about life about YouTube I cry
all the time for really no reason so
last time I cried would probably be
actually I might have been yesterday
last time you said you loved someone um
either last night or today yeah meaning
behind your youtube name it's kind of
straightforward Gretchen loves beauty I
didn't even I don't think I wanted that
to be my youtube name he just like
happened I was like I need one and I
love beauty so then Gretchen loves
beauty was born but if I could change it
I would I don't know what I would change
it to last book you read
it might have been the Great Gatsby for
English because I don't read if I don't
have to oh it's a book you're currently
reading no book I don't read guys come
on
I wish I read I wish I was one of those
people that were like oh this book is
amazing but I really like don't read I
wish I could I just get bored last show
you watched I think the last show I
watched it was like Dexter last person
you talked to Justin right before this
mm-hmm
the relationship between you and the
and you last texted it was Justin so
he's my boyfriend
I talk about him and like every video
we'd probably get annoyed but yeah
favorite food

because you also probably underestimate
how much food I consume and how much I
love food I love cinnamon buns I love
green beans that are warm with butter
and salt and pepper
I love yummy good pizza I love really
good ice cream I just had ice cream
before this I love french fries I love
peanut butter and Nutella on the rice

peanut butter and chocolate cookies I
love lots of food so I probably say I
have a favorite food oh my god I love
those peanut butter cookies but yeah I
like lots of food place you want to
visit I really want to go to Australia
because I just think that would be
really cool last place you were um well
I just went to my crew banquet and then
after we went to get ice cream do you
have a crush uh well yes and no I have a
boyfriend so I guess he's my crush I
don't know last time you kissed someone
