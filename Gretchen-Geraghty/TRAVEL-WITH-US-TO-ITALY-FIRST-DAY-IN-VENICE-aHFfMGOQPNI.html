well you're not but your baby never you
guys totally missed Taylor Taylor is
here whoa I look so dark because I put
on self-tanner last night and I just put
on bronzer so that was extra of me but
no guys update Taylor is now driving and
what did we do
oh we had to stop my sweet Korean and of
course it was 12:30 and rush hour at
speaker rush like lunch hour and so the
line was really long but they're really
good at being really quick and Dan at
Fenway shout out because well you were
really cute balls oh no oh my god he was
so cool anyway he I gave him like three
salad orders that were all very
confusing and he just like stuck with it
and got him alright so thanks but you're
the best and while my bronzer looks
really crazy right now but that's okay
we're fine and I'm just so lucky because
it was 1236 and I really should be at
the airport by now because my flight was
was leaving 2:30 and its international
however it got delayed to 250 and then
just now to 320 wait I hope you don't
miss start connecting one to Venice now
that's like an hour late cross your
fingers I think you should be fine
though I think the layover was like 2 or
3 hours so I feel like we're fine um and
did I tell you Maggie missed her train
and we were supposed to pick her up at
South Station and she literally thought
pull away cuz she was late so then she
heard all the way from Bridgewater to
the airport she said it was like $65 but
we're okay it's fine we got sweet green
salads everything is good
I got a guacamole greens I haven't had
one of these and so on let's see
good this reminds me of my little this
is what she gets but she doesn't eat
chicken I'm good
it's like I like it because the dressing
is like lime look it's really like
bitter good different I'm GH falafel
Taylor gets blah blah and now you get
spicy guy with no sunflower seeds add
broccoli and avocado Taylor gets went to
avvocato but with the basis spinach and
arugula and she adds falafel case you're
wondering I found good order doc to me
that's legit me me no know who did this
right here yesterday Abby why because we
kept getting lost and having huge
ratings but you know I'd be on a parking
ticket I didn't even tell you guys last
night Abby never drives like whenever we
go anywhere I just drive and last night
I was like you can drive she's like okay
like I'm kind of nervous for parking now
and I'm like we're going we went to a
10:45 movie and I'm like you're gonna be
fine
and but there was a Fenway game so all
along Brooke Arnab there's no parking
two hours after in four hours before
Fenway game which like makes sense but
then we found a spot like right out
front of the movie theater and there was
a bunch of cars because there was a good
toes own but then behind the sign you
know like everyone can park so we parked
behind the sign and then we come out and
then was poured $2 ticket and we're like
what the heck is this for and like a
block up at the front like all the way
up there like the front of the block it
said street cleaning midnight to 7:00
a.m. only on Fridays and it was at 12:45
on a Friday no and we were like gosh
dang it but it was only 40 at first it
said um it said like like something
number 146 and I thought it was 146 and
I was like oh my god I'm not telling her
but then I said like I'm out $40 but it
could have been so much worse when we're
in Montauk we were at the beach for two
hours and parked on the wrong side of
the road and it was 1:30 you're like two
hours
that's bad but yeah at least Ricardo
guys I did enjoy you yesterday but can
they see it oh yeah Aaron nail bar
shoutout err we love you did you go
there yesterday yeah I got my pedicure
and I went at 733 and they closed at
8:00 and she was like I don't even time
for a pedicure and I was like please I'm
going to Italy it she's like okay fine
and I cried man they did and they did
such a good job and they're so nice and
then dimwit me never has cash for like
tip and they're like we only have like
tip for like you can only do cash for
tip and I was like I'm parked like five
minutes away but I swear I'll run to my
car and get get cash and come back and
at which point I realized I never hid my
I never put in a jam pond and I was
bleeding all over the place so I was
like I really didn't go home but I
believe you to chip them so I went like
waddling in please and I gave them so
basically you're the best aired we love
you oh speaking of periods so then after
sweet green I was like ding and I need
to buns I don't have any left so then I
like zipped over to Target and I ran in
and I think I got out in like two and a
half minutes I really went running up
escalator for anything found escalator I
grabbed the first peg I saw so check out
zippity-doo-dah oh look we're like back

second
meanwhile we look for 20 minutes with
flashlights sort of in the middle of the
play wow I really need my sunglasses oh

to Gus and I don't have them in a video
the other day I was like my eyes are so
bad understand I hate it it was like

that fit together guys look it's the old
me I miss the old gotcha
this movie will graduate in the far
apart eyebrow grudges that was so funny
on my Instagram there are some other
funny ones too oh I didn't go back and
read all them they were really funny
whatever whatever Gretchen very funny
I'm so like I'm just this customers line
is really long but Maggie for so many
years
I know but I can't be on the camera
right now okay take a shower before I do
anything I know we're so scared
don't look at me right now though we got
tired little hostile thing and yeah we
can't wait to shower okay you go first
I'll upload a video do you need like
shampoo any things and I think me people
staying with us to dinners to keep
serving they're not here so we shall see
you new friends so guys we are going now
this is really horrible lighting I'm
gonna spare you move on our outside but
the lighting situation our room and
mirrors really bad so my makeup or stuff
like that I am I'll get you - oh so dark
but let's go we're at a train station
Maggie
actually we'll find out what they're
saying is that we're like
look it
that's sick we what it's literally like
water instead of a stream
I like wasn't expecting this I don't
know what I was expecting
that is so cool oh my goodness he I'm
such a Taurus Maggie what's that green
thing right they don't
three minutes whoa
these people just try to steal us but
it's okay and he was wearing one of
those morph suits ya know so special
what are these steps
over there I get the seagull hey guess
who just fell down the stairs she did
like a graceful fall right in the middle
of Venice I don't know it hurts
yeah it does guys look at me Maggie just
took pictures that are so pretty and I'm
like down this little alleyway we're
just gonna zip around and take some cool
pictures finally some good lighting
there's so many cute spots and then
we're gonna try to find it food and then
we'll end up getting gelato oh my God
look at this little place
I get really scared to vlog when we
click everyone on our tour but when it's
just us like off zipping around it's fun
oh my God look at this cool little nook
we found a secret spot we're having a
photo shoot but it's so pretty and I
need water
yeah we must go find water I'm so
thirsty
okay guys now we're in a spot where I
can stop and show you look at my legs
this is from the first time I fell just
that and then the second time I felt
like it kind of made it worse I in front
of my new friend I was trying to impress
wiki Maggie go but yeah so that's really
embarrassing and my chin has like a huge
bump on it and it really hurts but it's
okay Wow oh my god am I gonna like be
okay did I like heard it really bad it
hurts really bad and there's big bump on
it I'll be okay and then like what I
realized the issue is these steps are
like really not shallow like narrow
they're like oh yeah there's like
they're like short so like I don't know
my feel like aren't used to them and I
keep doing this where like I think my
foot goes like that I mean yeah see this
is so slippery right now because the
edges of them are like marble kind of
and I go like this and then I slip and
then that's how I felt the first time
then I just a second time I rolled my
ankle and naggy caught me oh my god so I
think a part of it is me just being
tired so I just put my phone now I'm so
home I've really done but um part of its
just like me being tired and not paying
attention but the other part of it is me
just being dumb and not paying attention
oh there's so many good picture spot but
don't worry it's not only about the
pictures I think I keep saying that I'm
looking for pictures obviously we're
taking it on because it's literally
beautiful it's so weird like being
somewhere I talked about this before too
and I was in Paris with the Eiffel Tower
like being smaller that you've seen so
much like on the internet or just like
that people have told you we're like
pictures and then you're actually there
in real life and you're just like whoa
like this is real I don't know like that
sounds really dumb but
but this is so cool and tomorrow we're
gonna go on like a boat tour and I'm I
haven't slept in like 24 hours or
something like I didn't sleep on the
plane because I couldn't but daddy's
okay and I'm making myself stay up so
that I'm like adjusted yeah this is so
cool okay we gotta find a place with
water or I'm gonna die I'm so thirsty I
think I like legitimately hurt my shin
like every step I take it hurts I'll
update you later I'm by shit from me
being stupid hi I think Italian pigeons
are nicer okay they're so cute
but it's really good the serving is very
small they're really little look at that
okay guys there's cool gelato in that
it's kind of dark but there it's right
this little bear
yeah which he yay guys okay be baggy I
know your room
I mean I'm magic not I'm not gonna say
matching room like a room for both yeah
so what happened was there's like four
people or I think even six in some rooms
or no I think most are four but then
ours this equation six I don't know so
how many people in a room I'm not
singing this right now but basically
we're just worried because we were like
well like we have like film videos and
stuff while we're here and there's like
four other people in our room and we
they're gonna have to be like hey be
quiet for the next 15 minutes or like
leave and that would be super rude so
then we asked the travel company people
Tyson we're like yo Tyson what up we
were like is there any other room we
thought we were supposed to get a double
anyway and he's like yeah you guys were
supposed to get a double like that's
what you like signed up for but um it
got I like so like greasy and his
battery died but um they were like full
or something and then he's like oh wait
like the driver isn't staying here
because he lives nearby so like you can
just have his room so now we're on the
seventh
and thank goodness I just feel so much
better that's we're not disturbing other
people yeah and I'm happy that we have
the same bed this you whew and we can
cuddle and be merry I just feel more
comfortable this and we have a cooler
view so what up yeah oh my god Mead do
you know how well we're gonna sleep
tonight and so well well me especially
since I haven't slept in so long it just
feels like I just like don't have to
ever sleep I feel invincible like I
could just keep going now because I
haven't slept in so long
look on the inside I'm probably died you
know I'm sure sir number Davis if you
don't sleep I think you die it's like 20
or 30 you actually need to sleep anyway
fun fact is that true okay tell me but
also we have to go down and have a
welcome dinner at 7:00 which is in seven
minutes and we are full because we got
Miyake that was really good a tiny
little Bowl but it was really good and
there's bread a caprese salad and I felt
weird like vlogging and talking where
two people are honest I just showed it I
was like young me too I was like this
acceptance way people that we do YouTube
ok guys I'm in our bathroom and it's
like bigger than our old one which I'm
really excited about and that's a good
day so that's really funny but I just
want to show you it's literally a ring
way like this was made for us like look
at this lighting and literally our old
room there was like one just one big
like floor mirror but not waiting like
and the bathroom to do like your makeup
or something and I was like how much
let's do my makeup and I was just
standing there like putting on makeup
blankly and I think it burnt Ito up this
is so good
high-five fuck you tomorrow pipe love
you and so like I'm more tired than I've
ever been in my whole life and I just
took to melatonin so that I literally
would pass out forever and I'm killing
it kick it Gretchen we have a problem
what my memory card just broke so I
can't I have my vlog
no I'm not kidding my whole first wait I
really hope you can get for the job fake
because I'd broken them before and then
all the footage on it is gone I even
knew right when I was putting it in the
other day I'm like fuck it felt like
loose I broken them into the worst ever
okay well anyway I hope you guys enjoyed
sorry today it was like a mess or did it
make sense
because I didn't sleep so I was probably
acting married we all know wag weird
when I don't like umm but I'm gonna
sleep for like 12 hours and I'll see it
and I am it's gonna be great we're gonna
get up at like 7:00 whoa</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
