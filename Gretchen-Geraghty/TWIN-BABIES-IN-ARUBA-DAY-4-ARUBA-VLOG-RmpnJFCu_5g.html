good morning happy last day of a rubub
walk well it's not our last day in Aruba
but it's lasted we're gonna be blogging
in Aruba because it's a fourth day and
dress inside be relative log four times
today is just gonna be like a typical
day I guess here because other days we
showed like really exciting things right
yeah we showed like the first day we got
here
we showed like going around the island
which we only did one day and then New
Year's Eve for the day after yeah so
then today is just gonna be like a
normal day where we just like go to the
pool on the beach all day
and Justins baby twin cousins are coming
so hopefully they can be in it we love
them in their cute little babies and
then we're just gonna go to the beach
right now it's really late already what
time is it 12 cuz I woke up at 11
dressed and woke me up at 11 I can't
believe I slept that late I literally
slept for 11 hours that means because I
went to bed at 12 anyway yeah thank you
we're gonna go to the beach and wait for
the babies to come finally we're getting
tan it'll be cool to watch like look
back a few of the vlogs and look at the
beginning and look at like right now and
like race a routine get anything to say
okay bye I just said come on let's go
pumpkin pie he goes I'm a human not a
pie come on
I'm sorry if it's really windy right now
I looked back on the second day of
logging in Aruba and it was like so
windy so sorry about that
Emira we stay where you stay the second
week is like back there and I really the
first week is like down that way more
it's like the Divi Resort in Aruba if
you guys noticed from like I don't
Instagram tags this is a good day for
vlogging it's so blue have anything to
say Justin hates the Sun it's really hot
our chairs are compared to the beach
isn't that so great everyone we're just
like sitting tanning and then you can
look out at the beach we were at the
beach a little bit but then we came well
I guess who beat me in a swimming race
ok Germany bundle up to cover from the
Sun he always puts his towel he's told
me all about soccer forever I know
everything there is to know about soccer
now right Justin quiz me make it easy Oh
that's how you're playing the Rochester
ito okay I'll let you continue talking
about soccer by now hi I'm surprised
you're awake from your nap well we came
back for lunch and we had really any
food and now where else to go to the
pool again and the twins are coming
Justin's mom went to go get them from
the airport and I'm super excited and I
changed my bathing suit because I have
to wear all of mine before I leave and a
bunch of you were saying and what I
packed through of a video but way too
many bathing suits you know what you're
probably right but I'm making myself or
all of them so sometimes that requires
to wear to a day so I only have a couple
left and we only have two more days and
I'm gonna wear them I promise
no I'm gonna do it tell me what you just
did he won bingo what did you win
dressed him so proud of you no I said
what these all backhand clear
Hey now you're lucky you better win
again
no posture this is cast you freaking won
again
trav is over the phone
it's not I just noticed yeah you're
terrible how red I am uh-oh we're gonna
go to dinner soon and I guess I'm not
gonna shower till after because I take
two on the shower so I'm not allowed to
know much how are you Steve
five hours you're ready so does that
mean I should shower after I'm gonna be
out a key for dinner I'm red
I just called Lucy it was great coming
home I thought there's things I wanted
to address I wanted to address the fact
that in some pictures I put on Instagram
in Lincoln vlogs earlier these bathing
suits of straps people are probably
gonna wonder why they're strapless and
just because I tried testing the straps
oh yeah you did take them either on to
be in it it's so cute
okay wanna do something funny sometimes
I think avens Justin and I like I like
pretend no I don't pretend why not
no I mean no Matt remember the other day
Justin yeah the other day I like when we
were getting those nachos I like I kept
kicking his butt because I thought I was
heroes and I want him to move but I
thought it was your foot and then like
the other day I like turned to him and I
like start or no I was like I'm in a
shower
except I thought I was talking to Justin
when I was talking you I always think
it's Justin
Trevor and Travis questions baby cousins
and they're so cute that's what I fear
here and it's really fun hanging out
with them and they just make the day
really fodder hopefully in the bottom
here you can take it and you can take a
video of yourself it's active been using

this what are we doing right now um

ever seen in my entire life I don't know

I want to know
I would have done limbo but we didn't
get that really enough I would have done
