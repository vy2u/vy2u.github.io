before I think so
extra how is your morning wait did you
get a green monster harvest one okay
harvest black is that the same I don't
know it does look the same the Green
Monster one was so good cuz it was like
barely anything I'm so yeah the
opportunity doesn't knock this build the
door GM in the whole thing boo we both
have the target kind up-and-up is where
it's at oh you have the real kind I'm
fake they both definitely oh my god I
told him yesterday that I wouldn't wear
this shirt again cuz I've worn it like
four vlogs in a row and Here I am see a
chunks in the trunk
bottoms up weird it's so good I thought
it makes you feel so much better
I just I'm drinking it cuz I feel like
dehydrated but just lie pack if you feel
like you're dehydrated or you don't
drink enough water or if you feel like I
think when you're sick sometimes you
feel like shaky or like you know what I
mean just like not good there is because
I think isn't there like really so I'm
like I don't know I'm talking about I
think that's right
but yeah you probably don't have enough
electrolyte so you can drink Gatorade
and stuff you know when you're sick you
drink Gatorade but um Pedialyte or up
and up pediatric or electrolyte solution
house way more or less like than
Gatorade so I was a strawberry like now
that's why I got this type because they
didn't have the real brand Pedialyte
strawberry Pedialyte sponsor me please
I'll freak out but actually just so you
know just so you're all aware since I'm
promoting this and this isn't sponsored
by them but I wish it was it's funny
that I have to say that um but wait what
was I gonna say oh it's actually made
for babies or like children with
diarrhea I'm pretty sure right I think
where'd you come up with these singing
the other day when you said kick rocks
but you actually said gay and they were
like I think that's just a really nice
way of being like f you you know hmm oh
yeah but anyway I just had to come over

Taylor were stringing yours and I was
drinking mine

you're not even like listening or
speaking at all you're so deep and
deeply engaged in your type stone Oh
what I realized there Lucy I was gonna
eat an apple before I went to class but
I hate my apples are warm and someone
took them out of the fridge
whoever you are one of my roommates that
took my apples out of the fridge I'm mad
no it's fine I really don't care I took
one of them and I put it in the freezer
so that it would be cold in like ten
minutes so I could eat it and I left it
there so now it's gonna be a frozen
Apple
I'm going after the roadway but um oh
yeah we're gonna go to saute and then
we're gonna go to Trader Joe's okay all
right you seem so out of it and like to
hire yeah I got a chocolate croissant as
an appetizer and then I got it
yogurt these look so good
what's my that sweet potato I knew
you're gonna say that it doesn't pick a
hash brown I think it says it was sweet
potato maybe it's even hash who knows
I'm freaking hungry oh my god I love and
there's caching it's like a gloomy day
but it's too like nice out are you
freezing yeah I know it said it's must
be sick Stephen I was like what it's no
like a day ago but I was just bringing a
sweatshirt earlier without this coat and
I was holding my coat that was hot
you know yeah
there's the tea everybody in case you
didn't know this they cosign is right
there the Citgo sign is legit like the
North Star you can see it from like
anywhere Whole Foods yeah I'm excited I
haven't been to this little Whole Foods
and forever
Lucy and me were just discussing the
differences between quick oats and
rolled oats which ones do you guys like
so we got their guacamole cuz their
guacamole at Whole Foods is the best
thing ever and I was going to start
getting other stuff to that I'm gonna
get at Trader Joe's but literally Trader
Joe's is so cheap compared to hold food
so we just like our $23
I don't you got like two three I got
three things ever I go to Trader Joe's
this thing of peanut butter like non big
enough for it to be other yeah I'm like
literally no oh this is me on the right
setting I thought whenever it was like
nine dollars
oh no it is peerless literally is like
$19 but whenever go to Trader Joe's I
have a full cart and it's usually like a
little under 100
it'll be like 99 for like so much stuff
so yeah
lip left Trader Joe's I give my hands
there so I just want like a half an hour
back with my trader Joe bags and they
were breaking and I got packages along
the way it was on pickup Center and like
I'm dead and I'm so scared they were all
gonna break and fall in comma but we
made it
you never so tired in my life bad guy
yeah I need water I can't breathe
look at this I don't know what's wet and
what's rain and I'm just my water with
my back carry I am like well I think I
injured myself I thought I could make it
like why didn't I Oh BRR oh my god and
then after I showed you I was in the
elevator this bag gave out on me and
fell in the hallway but at least a fella
in the hallway now I come out I'm just
trying to make tacos tonight for my
roommates that's all and I got so much
stuff that I couldn't even carry it like
I'm in a shoking wet sweatshirt you okay
guys so I mysteriously got these taco
stands in the mail yesterday I have no
idea who they're from or why I got them
and I asked all sorts of people did you
send me these and they said no my dad
was like what tacos Dana but that's what
they are so then in honor yeah I did and
he didn't tell him either
um and then I looked
oh it's within and honored that I was
like oh we need to talk out so I went to
Trader Joe's and got everything for
tacos except they didn't have tortilla
circles small enough for the taco stand
look you know when you get them in the
restaurants or like a small little
tortillas but the smallest ones I had
were just these nuts but you're still
too big but that's okay and we got the
guac from Whole Foods oh my gosh we're
making a mess but it's literally the
best walk ever if you guys have had it
it's so freaking good and oh I have
recommendation don't get these these
chips and Trader Joe's because I got
them to go with and they're fine but
they're way too salty like they're like
burning
my mouth from how salty they are and I'm
surprised because I feel like really
hard they're really hard to but I mean
corn chips I feel like are hard whatever
they're just like my really salty so
yeah and then I cut up some lettuce Lucy
made us some onions and black beans and
corn to put in them I cut up some sweet
potatoes and made those and oh I made
chicken and now I feel like I don't even
want chicken in mine
so yeah go for it cuz I don't know if I
really want them in my tacos maybe
oh and I got sour cream too and I want
to tacos sauce but I couldn't find taco
sauce Oh
so hello new camera I wonder if they can
notice a difference from like yours -
mine
just cuz mine's knew where la our
victory they told me to use at least 30
hots time that I learned coming my
followers oh our tacos were mad good I
ate two I'm so full</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
