it tell you about my experience going
through sorority recruitment and give
you some tips and things I didn't know
that I wish I knew
so if you guys don't know already I go
to Boston University I'm about to be a
junior and I rushed the spring of my
sophomore year so it's kind of later
than what most people rush at bu most
people go through your shorty
recruitment the spring either freshman
year but I was probably a lot of you
know I was on the lightweight rowing
team my full first year at BU so I just
didn't even know about recruitment or
really like what it was so I wonder how
spring I've been wanting to make this
video for a while for you guys and I've
gotten to so many questions about like
what we're permanent is maybe if you're
not from the US or there is a creek life
at school
so finally I'm like whoo I gotta do it
right now it's like nearing the end of
August and I know a lot of you guys are
actually going through grooming right
now for the fall semester of your school
actually my friend Tasha is going to
recruitment starting tomorrow at USC so
I think I got to get this video here
forever that's rushing kind of earlier
so first I thought I would just go
through some terms that I didn't even
know what they were going through
recruitment and then another thing is I
never really saw myself like in the
story you never knew that I would go
through recruitment but basically sex I
was in the lightweight rowing team all
my freshman year I was only friends with
athletes and I was in this little like
athlete bubble and it was great I still
love them but at the same time I knew
that I should probably branch out
especially going to Boston University
where there's like 20 thousand kids
undergrad I'm like I need to like meet
more people you know okay so obviously
rush I'm pretty sure just means like
recruitment like going through hushed
recruitment
same thing when years kind of talking to
all the different sororities and trying
to feel out like what you're gonna be in
and then to go with that like parties so
I didn't know what those were like I
don't know if you guys are like me like
I was just clueless like I didn't know
anything about them so basically the
different chapters on your campus each
chapter is like that specific sorority
on your campus and then the parties are
the different parties essentially that
the chapters have each day going through
recruitment so at BU it's four days long
I know it
the bigger schools accelerating schools
it can be like over a week at bu the
first day you meet with all Ted's and
then the second day you meet with 8:30
agree with five and I think that's like
half an hour 45 minutes and then the
last day prep night where you're between
your top two you meet with them for an
hour each that's how it goes with you I
don't know how it is other places and
then a bid is like your official
invitation into that sorority at the end
of rush and then a piano I never knew
what that was when people were talking
about about basically Canada I'm just
means potential remember so if you're
going through recruitment here at PNM
look at BU there was like 800 people
going to recruitment in the spring so
that was like 800 pm's another term I
heard a lot was a legacy didn't know
what that meant and a legacy is
basically someone who's I think it's
like their mom or their grandma or their
aunt like someone in their family above
them was in a specific sorority when
they were in college so that they would
be a legacy for that sorority a suicide
bid never heard that actually to like
the end of Rush and I think it'd be you
you're not even allowed to do it maybe
you are I don't know but basically it's
after a prep night you only pick like
one story but you'd want to be in so
it's kind of like suiciding because if
you only pick that one and then they
drop you then you're just not in any I
know if you don't do that because you
just pick like one two and if you get
through press night you're like
guaranteed to be there in your first one
you skate one and what's different of
you I know this is really different than
most schools but actually isn't already
houses at BU the recruitment actually at
a hotel and you just visit like ten
different rooms but the chapters like
set up for recruitment like a really
different experience in most schools
where you get to go to their house and
like tour the house and everything
because there isn't sorority housing at
the end and the group date your split up
and during recruitment it's like very
very organized I didn't even know about
going into it but they organized it so
well like you're not gonna feel lost if
you don't know what you're doing because
I was really worried
that but like no one knows what they're
doing is everyone's first time going
through recruitment you know and they
have like a run to current members in
sororities that disaffiliate during the
time of recruitment and you can't figure
out or know what sorority they're in so
that they like help you throughout the
process and you can talk to them and
they're kind of a few little Mentor
counselors I love mine they were so
sweet and happy either called PI PI's
but I know my other schools are called
micro gammas I'm a Minecraft night I sat
down with one of my podcast Danny and I
was like girl help me out like I don't
know what I'm doing and just kind of
like talking it out with someone just
really helps put into perspective like
your thoughts and like what one was
you're really feeling it
like for me I talked it out with her and
I was like wait I'm one partying company
I cried the other one I didn't I know
what I'm supposed to be in and it sounds
so crazy like I thought going into it I
was like oh this is a bunch of
mumbo-jumbo like girls are so crazy
together shorty might cry during
recruitment I'm like that's not gonna be
me like I don't even really care but
then like there I was impressed not
crying so you never know what another
thing I didn't realize is that they
match you up with people to talk to you
during recruitment based on maybe your
interest and where you're from and stuff
like that I thought it was just totally
random like I remember my first party I
walked into and I don't know I might be
different other schools again but we're
like walking in and like an athletic
align in there and a line inside to like
all the girls in the chapter and then
you would meet and like walk together
and I didn't realize that I was like
match up with a girl so I kind of wish
like looking around like walking around
she's like oh wait come on right over
here and I'm like wait am I talking to
you and the first thing she said to me
is I don't have to say New York and I
look at all the lightweight robberies
and I was like wow we're like the same
person
so you do match you up don't be like
afraid I guess it's actually nice having
something in common with the person
you're talking to you so you can be like
oh like upstate New York all blah
relatable it's like kind of hell that
way but like a little bit creepy like
they'll bring up things and you're like
wait how did you know that about me like
they stop you before you go through a
crewman like they pretty much talk
everyone they like look at your
Instagram stuff like that to like match
your face on interest so just just know
about because I was like why are all
these people like me another thing I
didn't realize is how much people that
are going to recruit me like research
sororities and
pick before work rib mimic which one
they want to be in which I totally would
not recommend because everyone said this
fbu during recruitment and I was kind of
like oh whatever but it's so true like
you have to trust the process because
it's that way for so many reasons and it
always ends up like working out and
another thing is you shouldn't talk to
other PNM's during the crimin about like
what sorority to your favourite or try
to like influence them on what one's
even your best or like you know what I
mean because some there's just biases
and like really you should just be in
the story that you feel the most
comfortable in and you feel like you can
be yourself and you feel like you're
with the girls that are gonna be your
sisters and best friends and I know it's
hard when you're with like eight hundred
girls going through it from and like all
anyone ever wants to talk about their
party isn't like oh did you go to this
one and hear that and blah blah blah
blah but like really trying to stay like
out of it all look I really was just
trying to like lay low and I'm not
trying to get involved in like a drama
or like because it could be really
dramatic especially towards it and
recruitment like people be crying and
really upset like so many people drop
but yeah I would just go into it
everyone says it's too like going to it
so open-minded because you have no idea
what's where you're gonna end up in and
I really do think it all works out for a
reason because for me specifically
because I'll just say it right now I
went into it is open-minded as I could
but also rushing as a sophomore I knew a
lot about the sorority just being Effie
you already for a year and a half and I
you had the girls in the different
charities so I kind of face them off the
girls that I knew in the different
sororities which again like I wouldn't
recommend doing so going into it I'm not
even say the names of any sororities at
all but this is one story that I knew a
bunch of girls in thought they were so
sweet and I was like I'm gonna be in
this radiant
I just knew and then after the first day
meeting with all ten I was like wow that
one definitely stood out to me above all
the others like I'm gonna be in this row
do you love them they're so sweet great
it's all over like I don't want this one
then I come back the next day and the
only sorority that I'd dropped me it was
that sorority and I was crushed like I
think I almost started crying again like
tears man cuz I was like what the guy
was just so thrown off because I was
like I had such a great conversation
with the girls I talked to you like mere
life laughing I was a ton present like
it was great and then so pretend to be
like the only match
I mean I was like crush do you know what
I mean what I realize it really does
work out the way it's supposed to and
I'm so happy I didn't drop because I
really was considering it because that's
like the only one I wanted to be in so
do not go in to recruitment with that
mindset because you just have to be so
open minded like I probably would have
been happy in a number of sororities but
definitely one I ends up in is like so
for me and I found with my best friends
in there so yeah definitely it's already
dropped to you it's for a reason and you
would be better off not and that's
worthy anyway so don't worry about that
yeah I'm so blessed it worked out the
way it did because I think if I end up
being the one that I wanted to be in I
wouldn't have been as happy if I'm in
there and then right now that make sense
and again like this time goes with what
I said before but definitely rush like
for yourself and not for like friends
because you want to be in a sorority
with them or like just try to be in a
sorority but you already have friends in
because the way I saw as I went into
recruitment knowing like maybe ten
people that were going through
recruitment as well oh I don't like
being sophomores at dinner rush freshman
year me so many of my friends dropped
going through it so many people drop
going through because they just realize
it's not for them and it's totally okay
and I actually all the people that I
rushed with that are conservatives were
all on different ones so I think that's
even better because like you're still
friends with them you can make friends
with their new friends they can make
friends with your new friends and just
kind of like expands in your whole crime
group instead of rushing with like three
of your friends and because we all need
to be in this one you know anything so
definitely I think just follow your
heart it was so dumb but like you'll end
up where you need to you know now that
the governor's dress is try it even if
you're only a tiny bit considering it
because I really wasn't like I said
before I didn't see myself in a sorority
I was like oh I don't know but really
what pushed me to rush was that I was
like I want to make my friends and
branch out look I'm at BU for four years
and friends of like my little athlete
bubble over here but like I'm not going
to meet all these other people and like
how can I meet with them how can i
connect with people and like make other
friends along that bu because like
that's for me one of the biggest parts
of college like meeting people that are
different than yourselves and kind of
branching out and you know when I met
different people's culture further from
just everything so I just that was
really important
to meet different types of people Effie
you and I was so nervous before Kermit I
was so nervous I really day before being
with my friend saw shipping I can't do
it I can't do it I'm freaking out like I
was so nervous about like talking to
everyone but really just know that been
really excited to meet you as you're
excited to meet them and they're college
kids just like you yes they're nice
already already but they just want to
have a conversation with you and hear
about what you're doing what your
interests are like what your major is
where you're from
like how many dogs that your sibling and
stuff like that so that's really what I
would recommend talking about during
your conversations with people anyway
whatever is important to you talk about
that but yeah remember what I was saying
before even if you're like iffy about it
just try it because you can always draw
off but everything once you start you
might find evidence for you yeah I would
just definitely recommend it and then
like I was saying before things to talk
about maybe to not talk about as well I
remember one girl said this to me going
through recruitment and kind of stuck
with me and she's like don't talk about
the three B's and I'm like what's that
and it's boys booze and Barak and I know
Brooke isn't our president anymore
basically don't talk about politics
don't talk about boys and don't talk
about drinking or partying anything so
they're kind of a more I don't know just
topic so you shouldn't talk about your
big ass word for me YouTube always came
up I know some of my friends that do
YouTube going to recruitment kind of
like didn't want to talk about it or
bring it up but when people would say to
me but what you do what clubs you in
what sports do you play above I'm like
literally I do nothing because of this
one big thing that's my whole life so
like obviously I have to talk about it
and so many people thought it was so
cool but obviously if you're not doing
YouTube just talk about like your major
what you're so interested like the
club's you're in like stuff like that
you know another thing I want to say is
after going to recruitment in before you
go in as well during it just nobody
doesn't have to be your whole life and I
know Greek life is like a way bigger
thing me down south but at BU it's like
a really fun great thing to be in for
like your social life I was like
philanthropy getting internships jobs
and I want to look at other schools it's
like I'm Gretchen I'm an alpha P instead
of like FB you it's like I'm Gretchen
see but I also do all these other things
so we have filling out my old friends
for Greek life that I met through
lightweight roaming I still obviously do
YouTube I still do so much that I did
for Greek life but just kind of like
adds to your experience of college I
would say and also I wanted to know that
I remember during the new member period
right after I joined I was so
overwhelmed like I was obviously very
stressed out during recruitment
I remember I lost my voice I got kind of
sick cuz you're there like all day long
you like forget to eat you like don't
sleep as much because you're like really
freaking out and nervous and it's just
like a stressful time and then during
the emember period it's so fun like mid
night was so fun but everyone's just so
excited to meet you and you have stuff
like every day but I'm number two after
you join so I remember being like oh my
gosh this is there any so much
commitment like I don't know if I can
handle this like a big part of the
reason I quit lightweight roaming was so
that I could you know focus on academics
try to be a good normal person that
didn't like to sleep three hours a night
and was running on nothing and I started
to feel like whoa I'm overwhelmed with
sororities already but just know that a
new member period is a lot more stuff
going on and stressful than like once
you're actually initiated and like in
the sorority because there's just so
much you have to do right as you're in
this room you like you try to meet
everyone big.little
all that but at least like a P you have
a timeline everybody goes after be a
little bit calm down a lot more and you
can kind of be as involved or as less
involved as you want to be so definitely
recommend being like super involved
because that way is just way more fun
and you get to like hang out with your
sisters and you know do really cool
stuff for your philanthropy or
fundraising I bet people that are really
worried about the commitment just know
that you get out as much as you put into
it kind of the same as YouTube I think I
covered like everything that I had a lot
of misconceptions about who's kind of
like advice for you guys I know I
definitely probably left this stuff out
of here so if you guys have any
questions or like subjects that I
totally like doing touch on definitely
leave me a comment down below so I can
answer for you guys I might make that
the part to this video or do another
talk about like Greek life specifically
yeah I think that's it thank you guys so
much
not going to recruitment here yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
