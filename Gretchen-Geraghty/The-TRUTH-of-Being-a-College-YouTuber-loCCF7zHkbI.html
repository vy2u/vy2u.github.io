exciting video for you guys and it's
actually a collab video with two other
youtubers one is Sara forget you guys
probably have heard of her she's such a
sweetie I love her videos her channel
will be linked down below and the other
youtuber is Brooke Vinci oh and I know
I've done collab videos with her before
- such a cutie I love both of them they
are so nice and so sweet so I'll have
both their channels linked down below
and definitely go check out their videos
cuz I know they're doing videos that are
like the truth about college as well so
that's a card whole theme going on and
I've been wanting to bone this video for
awhile and I'm really excited for you
guys to hear what I have to say because
I feel like there's a lot of interesting
things that to know about being a
youtuber in college so I have 9 little
truth that I've written down in my phone
so that's why I'm like reading off my
phone if you're under in my case it's
from Amazon because I have a lot of
questions about that but yeah the first
one is you have no time and literally
I'm not kidding when I say like you just
don't have any time with I have a lot of
other stuff going on at the YouTube
other than just YouTube that also takes
into account a lot of my time but
especially with YouTube you have no time
like it really is a full-time job so
having YouTube on top of academics on
top of trying to balance your social
life and having fun like it's a lot in
the fall I really really really really
struggled with time management like I'm
not kidding when I tell you I would get
3 hours of sleep every night but in the
spring I got a lot better with it and
it's definitely manageable but when
you're in college you to worry you don't
have time for anything and a lot of
times YouTube has to come before your
social life which sucks but it's worth
it because it's my job and I love it
sorry if you can hear my family talking
they're like in the family room
downstairs so you might be able to hear
them the second truth I ever in down is
filming in your dormers heart especially
if you're that close with your roommate
or even sturdy are you bad lighting
luckily I was very close with my
roommate she was such a sweetie
her name's mkhaya I miss her she's in
California but yeah if something wasn't
that bad with her at all like I would
film with her in the room she would
watch me and it was like really funny we
would like laugh while I was filming or
she would walk in and I could be in the
video so like that was totally fine the
hardest thing probably about my room is
just that we were both very messy people
we were perfect roommates for each other
so I would have to like pick up to film
obviously so that would be hard and
lighting is like iffy in college I would
definitely try to film it during the day
even
I try to do at home but if you like
don't get along with your mayor don't
really know that when you have to film I
know it can be hard the third truth
fiber and down is vlogging or filming
during the day is weird because it's
your college campus like at home in my
hometown I would have no problem just
going about my day like blogging you
know but in college I would just feel so
weird because these campus I could about
some university by the way this is like
the first video of mine that you're
watching be used canvas if you don't
know is literally just like probably
like a mile and a half like straight
down like city sidewalks I just feel
weird because you just see everyone like
you see all your peers they're like
they're watching you film yourself and
like at home I would just feel like
strangers so yeah I just feel weird
vlogging at school it's definitely
weirder College the fourth thing I have
is getting recognized by peers is fun
but also everyone knows you as the
YouTube girl a lot of times for amuse we
set the bus stops I don't know why but
I'd be waiting at bus stop like after my
classes would be done for the day to go
back to West Campus where I lived and I
know he's just running to people that
watched my videos at bus stops I don't
know why I like people that want to be
like I love your videos and I found
really interesting is that a lot of
people that watch my videos and go to be
you like found my videos because they go
to be you too and they would see that I
posted like a Boston University like
don't room tour or stuff like that so I
thought that was really interesting but
yeah and also everyone does know you as
a YouTube girl like you blow me you pick
oh are you that call that does YouTube
and I'm like yeah me so I mean I guess
that's cool I don't mind at all like I
totally embrace it if it thing is since
you're in college now you have to
explain YouTube all over again to new
people not like in high school and
everyone knew like in my high school I
just remember walking on the hallway and
people be like Shelby what's up like
literally that was my nickname like
people just call me GLB and that's
really funny is there's only like one
person at BU
that calls me GOP and it's funny when I
see him he's like GLD and it like makes
me think of high school so it's just
funny having to explain YouTube and like
how you got started and everything like
all over again cuz you're so used to
everyone just knowing like in high
school and some people just have no idea
like the YouTube world exists like some
people just come from completely
different backgrounds they know nothing
about it it's really cool when people
are like really into it they're like oh
my gosh I probably even like seen your
videos before so that's really cool but
you just have to be really like open to
explaining it to people because a lot of
people like don't even understand it the
sixth thing I write down is really funny
him you become really
closed when the workers at your mailroom
that's Teddy barking sorry because
getting a million packages is way harder
at school than is at home because your
packages have to go to a mailroom and
then you have to go pick them up so I
literally would be getting packages
every day and ever one time was too
embarrassing
I had so many packages that I literally
couldn't carry them and people had to
come like help me bring them out to my
dorm I'm like okay where are my friends
and I need them like yeah basically you
get really close with the workers at
your mail room that you by name and if
you didn't understand what I meant by
that I just mean like when you're
youtuber you just get a lot of packages
like working with brands and stuff so
yeah that's that the 7 thing I wrote is
that people still make fun of you and
hate just like in high school some
people just don't understand you know
but some people will think it's cool
there's still give me people that would
like make fun of you and I list in my
case I feel like a lot of the time it's
more like behind my back and I just like
hear of people like gossiping and being
rude and like telling my friends and one
time I actually read it to my face which
was really weird he's like that's so
weird pull up but like people won't
understand and they'll be mean and you
just have to deal with that and I think
I've gotten pretty used to that being on
YouTube for so long now I'm dealing with
hate but I mean so sometimes it gets to
me I posted a video on my vlog channel
with Lucy recently like why I feel that
and you're just opening up because
someone literally took time out of the
day to email me like please do not leave
mean comments like they do make me feel
bad like I really tried to not them get
to me but still sometimes I do so you're
gonna deal with hate just like you
always said if you do youtube in college
but like I said also some people
whooping it's really cool and I love
being able to explain it to someone new
who's never experienced like youtuber
knows youtubers or anything and they
think it's so awesome and they wanna
like learn more about it and I just love
people that learn about it with an open
mindset you know I think the vacuum is
going now so I'm really sorry if you can
hear stuff downstairs the a thing I
wrote is you have to be careful what you
say about all times because you were so
much more visible and I've gotten myself
in trouble before you really really have
to be careful what you're putting on the
internet and you're ready more visible
like being out of university I feel like
because for me posting videos that say
that Boston University like anyone at
Google as Boston University can find
them so you really are very visible as
it called youtuber and you have to be
very careful of how you come across and
I've run into issues with that before so
it's a lot to say about that
and you lasted nine thing I have to say
is
might sound bad but all of your friends
are broke and can't eat out with you all
the time or go shopping with you all the
time because basically is it called
YouTube where you're working like
full-time in college and most of my
friends and probably your friends too if
your ecology tuber
don't have a job at college or at least
not one that pays well enough I don't
know you know I'm saying so yeah like
honestly the truth is like a lot of your
friends just don't have money to eat out
with you and go shopping with you all
the time and maybe a couple of your
friends do and so you hang out with them
more because they can with go do fun
stuff with you and I don't mean to
offend any of you by saying that but I
just thought it was something funny to
know and literally all my friends are
like okay Christian we're not going to
speak green again no I can't go to new
area and go to brandy with you again and
Lilou and LF because I don't have any
money left like everyone's broken
College you know but if you have your
full time youtube job in college then
you're not broke which is nice so those
are all my truths of being a youtuber in
college like I said I'd definitely go
check out Sara's and Brookes videos
because they are amazing and I love them
don't we subscribe like I already said
and yeah thanks so much for watching
this video and I'll see you in my next
fun bye
well Y can like see all my pores this
lighting is crazy my skin so try I don't
even feel about their red lips guys I
don't know I was just feeling it I feel
like they go with black and white
stripes as I'm like a true rad took a
reddish dark bean I think comment down
