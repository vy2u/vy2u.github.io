go ahead a plane for the first time at
myself but you moodily across the
culture too
nervous but I know I'll be okay I just
ate some cereal
I was running a little late fancy
Nashville hopefully I make it on time
yeah just telling my dad that I don't
know how I feel about vlogging by myself
because usually I feel like I feel more
comfortable time with people that I know
so I don't really care what other people
think but if I'm all the way by myself I
feel like I'm living in a beer
but so I might not fog that much on the
plane and I'll try a little though
but I think I got to pick my seats and I
think I did the aisles because I like
the aisles he suspected I had more room
but I like beer in the window because he
can like take pictures up and then I
feel like claustrophobic I pushed into
the side of the plane
so I don't know and I'm you Natasha at
LAX and I traveled for ten hours
I go from 130 here to 830 there and then
add like the three hours for the time
difference
yeah I do it's like two and a half hours
to delay over so I guess I'll be
watching a lot of the vault season of
The Bachelor that I got so I needed to
hang her I feel we're talking to myself
this is like always what I remember
about O'Hare because of all the pretty
lights and pretty colors
just starting
you know walk the halls over there
I'm so tired that out to my friend Alice
for this shirt we're at our Airbnb which
it's so cute I was kind of worried about
but it worked out so well it's like
perfect for us it's gonna be so great
and yeah I'm really excited to go to bed
because it's like a million thirty my
time oh yeah and we're gonna go shopping
tomorrow
and hopefully find some acai bowls and
it's gonna be so fun and I already love
it even though it's dark so it's gonna
be really good
do you get tan here easily or useful
here then at home easier than home or is
it like the same on the night say it's
about the same we're like more south
right than New York yes okay okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
