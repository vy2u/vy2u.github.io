triangle swimwear review video and this
video is actually been requested so so
much and I think it's just because I
know I've talked a lot about triangle
and like different haul videos and I
post pictures of me wearing them on my
Instagram if you don't follow me on my
Instagram you totally should it's that
Gretchen Liz PD woohoo oh yeah a lot of
you know I'd like to triangle swimwear
for a while now and you wanted a review
and this is going to be totally honest I
have some pros and cons to them I
actually have a lot I have eight I will
be showing you which I know is way too
many bathing suits for one person but
I'm obsessed I just think they're really
cute and yeah so actually brought them
all down here in this huge bag because I
couldn't even carry them all and I guess
we will just jump right into things yeah
so first things first they will come in
either a box
or like sealed in like a plastic bag I
think it just depends on the style like
which one and then under that is one of
these puppies which is just like a
drawstring neoprene bag and most of
their bathing suits are neoprene by the
way which is one of the reasons why I
like them so much because they're really
good quality and they'll last a long
time because it's like this really thick
material that like wetsuits is made out
of so they come in these packaged them
nicely and then also you can like use
these bags after they're like we're
usable I just grabbed two to show you
since I don't remember like any of the
names to these I will just have them
listed on the screen as I'm talking
about that certain style but I'll have
them linked all down below so you can
check those out so I guess I'll just go
right in order and show you all the ones
that I have the first one I have is just
this basic one which is the light pink
one with the black outlines and I have
two that are in this style this one is
just clearly very basic it's just like a
triangle one and one thing to know is
that they actually don't have removable
like padding in there there's not like a
cop like there isn't a lot of ating
suits but since it's such thick neoprene
like material you don't really need it
and it just ties at the top and like
that and
in this top I have a small and then in
these bottoms I have a small too and the
bottoms are not my favourite only
because I don't like how thick they are
on the side for tan lines but other than
that they're alright
I just AM weird about like tan lines so
they are a more like full coverage
bottom and not as cheeky as like some
other ones and also another thing to
know is that neoprene bottoms actually
like pick up water and I realize that
like the first time I win the pool at
them so like water will get in your butt
when you're like swimming and you'll get
out and you'll have like a bathing suit
full of water and I always have to like
pick up the side to like let the water
drain out so keep that in time and I'm
small in these too
and then I just have this royal blue one
with black around this side it's just
like the pink one but in royal blue so
the top looks like this and there's like
a seam right down the middle if you
didn't notice in the pink one and then
the bottoms same thing but in blue and
then this top and bottom are also both
smalls and I know sizing is kind of
tricky because you can only order their
bathing suits online so I notice they're
sizing chart actually does a really good
job at figuring out what size you're
going to be because I looked down there
and it worked for the most part like I'm
five eight and a half I'm usually four
bottoms like a zero or a 2 and then my
top is usually like an extra small or
small like sizes are weird you know they
change like from place to place and
bottoms I would say small fits pretty
good and then for tops that can be
either small or an extra small because I
really don't have any boobs so smalls
and extra small fit me and in certain
styles extra small is actually fit
better and then I have this one to show
you this top I actually haven't a small
but I would recommend if you were
getting this style of top if you
normally get a small get an extra small
because it's really loose around and if
I were to do it all over again I
probably would get this in an extra
small and I actually have this style of
top that I got after that I gotten an
extra small and it fits a lot better so
yeah keep that in mind I think this top
might run a little big it's just white
with like the black mesh and it goes
with these like orange coral bottoms and
I really like these ones are a little
different because I don't have the black
lining around the outside and they're so
cute and they make you look really tan
when you're wearing them and then
they're like the same cut as these ones
but just all orange and then these next
two I have to show you are actually the
same style but different colors so this
style one has a bunch of different
colors it has yellow here
and then right here is actually like
this mesh material it's white and then
pink and I really like these ones I
think they're so cute but some of you
actually commented on other videos of
mine and said like that's not the style
for you since you don't have boobs you
can't like fill out the cups and I was
like sad face like I still like wearing
them so you know what you do you girl if
you like it you get it anyway so like
this top I actually have in an extra
small because I knew I didn't have any
boobs like fill out the cups and it's
still kind of big anyway but then the
bottoms I still just got a small because
small bottoms fit me the best and it's
cool because like sometimes the inside
lining is a different color mesh right
there another thing to be careful of
some tips for neoprene as I've learned
the hard way is that if you keep it
crumpled up in your dresser like this
they will get wrinkled and it's hard to
get them out so like you can kind of see
mine's a little wrinkly now I've learned
to lay them out flat like this so
definitely be careful when you're
putting yours away then I have it in
this blue color so it's like blue on the
side white nor like a highlighter yellow
color up there and this one isn't mesh
it's just like normal neoprene and then
this top is also an extra smog and the
bottom just look like this with the
white right there and then blue and then
black on the inside small in these
bottoms so those last five triangle
bathing suits I showed you I actually
bought all with my own money and that's
another thing I wanted to get into I
know they're quite pricey and when I
mean quite pricey I mean like they're
really expensive for bathing suits but I
just kind of think of them as like an
investment and if you think you're going
to wear them on if you think they're
really cute so like for me I'm at the
pool like all day every day I lifeguard
outside and we're actually allowed to
wear bikinis so I can wear these to work
I start outside in the Sun for eight
hours I wear bathing suits all the time
so like really practical like thick good
quality neoprene bikinis make sense for
me but definitely they're like an
investment I know they're quite pricey I
think the quality is worth it so that is
what I have to say about that and like I
said I bought all those with my money it
was quite expensive but yeah and I was
fortunate enough to actually have one of
the people that works at triangle find
my YouTube channel and she saw some of
my videos and she found my Instagram and
she saw that I love triangle bathing
suits and that I've been wearing them
forever and she offered to send me some
so these three that I'm going to show
you actually got sent to me
but I'm not getting paid for this video
it's totally my opinion they were just
kind of a gift because I love triangles
so much so thank you so much Emma you're
the best thank you thank you thank you
someone else actually commented on with
my videos and said you should try the
kind of zippers up right here because it
would be good for you since you don't
have boobs Italy is like more of a flat
bikini since it's like a bandeau so the
top is like this it's like hot pink
coral right there with like orange at
the top and then light pink in the back
and it clasps like this and this is just
like a push little clip and this top I
got on an extra small just because like
I said I don't have boobs
the bottoms I just got in a small light
pink with like hot pink right there and
like orange on the inside so I really
like this one and I can't wait to wear
it and since these are new and I haven't
actually like worn them swimming yet
they still have the tags on them it's
just like black and it says a triangle
and then I got this one it's just like
turquoise bottoms with a yellow and
white triangle top and this top is more
similar to the ones I first showed in
this video the pink and blue one is just
like a triangle top but this one's
different because the bottom right there
is white and then the top is yellow so I
got a small in this top and then it goes
with these like turquoise aqua blue
bottoms and honestly my favorite fit of
bottom is these ones I think all the
other ones are like this fit like the
thicker ones but this style comes with
like the tie bottom so you can make them
like tighter and I like how its skinnier
on the side so you get less of tan lines
that's what I worry about I don't know
about you guys and then last one I have
to show you is different it's the black
like leathery one I made still made out
of like neoprene just with like a
leather like coating it's like this so
this top is actually the same style is
this white top with the black mesh so I
remember that this small and that style
is too big on me and I actually got this
an extra small and it fits perfect it's
just like black leather it's really
simple and I love the back of this one
how it's just like really simple just
like a skinny little strap and this one
clasps in the back too and then the
bottoms are the same as most the other
ones they're just like thicker on the
side it's are just like shiny black
leather so those were all my triangle
bathing suits this is kind of like a
collection slash review and
all my honest opinions I think they're
really cute I know they're quite pricey
so if you're someone that's obsessed
with bathing suits and swims a lot like
me then I totally worth it if not then I
don't know if I would spend that much
money on a bathing suit personally and
like I said I don't want to get any mean
comments those last three bathing suits
were sent to me but I'm not getting paid
for this video and it's totally my
honest opinions and it's been requested
so much since I talked about them all
the time and if you get any of the same
triangle bathing suits as me or have any
of the same ones as any definitely like
tweet pictures at me because I would
love to see how they look on you we'd be
twins
and yeah I'm it's pretty much all I have
to say about triangle being suits so
thank you so much for watching and I
will see in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
