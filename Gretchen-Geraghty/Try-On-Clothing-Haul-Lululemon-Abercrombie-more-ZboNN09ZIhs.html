a really fun impromptu little haul video
I literally just threw my vlog camera
down here my pillow so we can just
settle in and talk about some fun new
clothes I've got a nice mic let's start
with this holy moly
this is my favorite thing you guys know
Lauren Elizabeth here on YouTube be
honest I haven't actually seen her
videos in a very long time but I follow
her on Instagram I love her Instagram
I'm obsessed it's like the cutest stuff
oh wait by the way you're not already
follow me on instagram please follow me
on instagram insularly
my favorite thing ever i post like a
million times a day you can add me on
snapchat you can add me on twitter you
can keep up to date with me I'm a hot
mess you guys know a Miss for an Abby
she always calls me that she was your
hot mess at least you're hot though and
I got this red jacket because Lauren
Elizabeth posted it on our Instagram and
I was like where is that from I need it
and she tagged her bulb and I found it
under balm and it's from the brand
lovers and friends and it's just like
cropped and this beautiful her little
jacket it's fake for her by the way and
it's just like this beautiful brown
color I love it then you guys know that
I just got back from LA I'm back in
Boston at school now and what's funny is
we were wandering around Abbot Kinney
and we walked into this place called
Skylark this little like boutique and I
saw this sweater and I thought it was so
cute it looks like crazy crops when I
hold it up right it's like I was like
literally how do my boobs fare right
there then you can see on it still like
super cropped but it it works you know
and it's funny is Maggie for that day I
actually brought this exact same sweater
like in her bag so that she could like
put it on if she was cold and hers is
from Urban Outfitters but it's literally
the exact same one so this is so cute I
love it been in LA as well we went to
the honey bun
pop-up shop and you guys already know
honey but mine is actually my first
store of all time me and Maggie are just
obsessed with it so when we went there
you guys probably saw our obnoxious
Instagram pictures we got this matching
set which I'm so obsessed with it's so
comfy and cozy it's just this black and
white striped matching sets like these
really comfy pants and then the top is
so comfy as well it's just this little
tank top crop top and they look so cute
together and we had way too much fun
running around in these everyone thought
we were crazy oh and by the way honey
bum please get this back into small
because there's only one small in the
store so Maggie on it cuz I was like
listen girlfriend we both need
and we both are really like a small but
I was like I'm fine I'll get the medium
so it's like kind of big but then Emma
couldn't get one because they only had a
small medium and a large
three or so seven she couldn't get one
and then I looked online to get her this
small and like surprise her with it
but you guys are sold out and small
there's only mediums larges left so like
please restock honey of them because
everyone needs this too so that every
member of the trio can have this then I
got this red little crop top it just has
white trim and it says honey and it's so
cute and lose he actually just return
this to me she stole it from me because
she liked it too and I got these green
pants I'm so obsessed with these guys me
and Maggie try these on in the store and
we're like these are so cute they looked
so good I'm like both of us do it
literally like sister into the Traveling
Pants because Maggie's probably like
five five and I'm five nine and they
like fitness both really well like
obviously they're shorter on me but they
fit me so well and like what's weird is
this I got and it's small but this I got
Ana medium and then this I got in a
medium and like sometimes I get me a
honey bun because I don't my clothes to
be too tight but sometimes small work so
this is a small and I just love these in
green little trousers oh it then I got
these jeans because Maggie and Emma had
them I like getting what I like and I
know what I like by seeing other people
wearing it do you know what I mean so
like I'm not mad that I copied my
friends and like copying is the most
sincere form of flattery and no my
friends find that I got me them like I
got this sweater because I have you had
it it's an urban and have this link down
below to because it's really cute but
anything I can find in this haul video I
will link down below so you guys can
find it so Maggie and I'm a Havanese
jeans from Abercrombie and they were
getting a million thousand questions
where they're from and everyone
Abercrombie I think I left out and
ordered these just in time because I
just looked yesterday and there's like
no sizes left there's like one pair left
in like a 24 or whatever got these in 27
because my waist is a 27 yeah they're
just like medium off a bunch of rips up
but they're like brilliant at the bottom
and then I'm so gonna Maggie and Emma
and they were like you're ordering these
right now you need them so I was like
okay I did it and I hope they like
restock them or something I'm sad
because I don't know if you guys can get
them cuz there's like not that many left
but I'll still like try to find a link
to them so I can link them down below
and are on sale to you which was really
sick oh then when I was home over break
I went to Lululemon and went kind of
wild I haven't been to lemons on so I
keep playing with my hair I just noticed
I'm doing that I do that a lot
I'm not going
the rest of this video so I went to
Lululemon over break and like I said
went kind of wild and these are actually
really dirty because I warm yesterday
morning SoulCycle I have seven I am but
these are just they're aligned leggings
and I've had the original lines that I
loved how soft and like buttery they
felt and Maggie's obsessed with like the
new ones so I was like maybe I should
try the new ones and I got a pair and I
love them in my word of advice is size
down in the lines because normally I'm a
four on their leggings but these are
literally gotten into which like I'm
normally not into from there like to is
so tiny to is like Emma sighs you know
Mandy sighs like really little I just
get these any two because they're super
thin and like really stretchy and I like
my leggings like tight so they can like
hold me and you know I'm trying to touch
my hair now that's just like but I
promise the video not gonna do it I just
felt like the new version of the aligns
I heard that you're not supposed to wear
a lines just soul because they're so
soft and like buttery feeling that it
can like mess up fabric and make them
pill or whatever but I've been adding me
issues with them because like know about
that cute let me know and if it is bad
to wear them just like soul or get
really sweaty and running them in what
leggings should I get from Lulu that
would be good for that I know there's
speed tights I really liked for running
wonder under oath and those like aren't
my favorite anymore
the high-waisted ones are good but yeah
probably speech I chose my favorite
running but if you have any other
recommendations then I found this sports
bra on top actually on sale and it's
perfect and I'm so happy I got it cuz
I've already worn at eight bunch what's
really good is that it goes high next
because my boobs kind of a sprouted in
the past year and I never like I'm
living a double A's before and now
they're probably like a solid B at least
but in SoulCycle you know you're like
leans forward a lot and so like my boobs
would literally just like fall on my
sports bra I'm like don't do that so
anyway what I'm trying to say is hi and
neck things are really good for me when
I'm like working out especially this
whole cycle so like that this goes
higher and I like the mesh at the top I
think it's a cool detail and it was
funny as the other morning I would just
be creative my friends and I have a good
sweater over the top so you just solid
thin mesh poking out and she was like
are you still wearing your body suit
from going out last night and I'm like
no I'm wearing this bar throbbing about
a workout and then I love the back of it
like the details I just think it's
really cute it looks with cute
and I like it a lot oh it's inside out
good job Gretchen I wore this yesterday
morning SoulCycle as well with few lines
if you could itself and also it's really
good of those lines is this top that I
got I like getting these like black
little sports bra working out type of
tops to wear them as tops because I used
to wear like actual t-shirts and tank
tops and stuff but especially I like
SoulCycle and if you're like I don't
know like running or walking on the
treadmill I feel like it's acceptable to
wear like really heavy sub leggings and
like a little sports bar or something
because it like almost touches and
you're not like naked you know anyway so
this is the free to be for like longer
version sports bra so that it like goes
longer and you can wear with a high
waisted leggings look it's hot and it
just Criss crosses in the back like the
normal free to be except this one is
just longer yeah then from private party
which if you guys don't know I'm pretty
sure they like started the whole
one-piece swimsuit like graphic trend
where it just has like the words across
the front and now like every website you
can probably find a one-piece swimsuit
that says like Rosa all day or whatever
um but I feel like private party kind of
started that and their swimsuits are
just such good quality guys like they
are pretty pricey like I want to say
it's like 100 for each one but they're
just like such good quality like I've
always wanted one and then perform until
I I got see a champagne campaign one
which I actually can't find it might be
with my swimsuit over there like in the
laundry or something but I were a bunch
in LA and it's around here somewhere I
literally almost wore out the other
night with like a skirt cuz I was like
I'm so obsessed with this weird if
advice they do run small but like okay
so I got my own a small medium and I'm
five nine so it really goes at my butt
and like shows on my boobs which like I
think it's kind of the look of them
anyway like it's kind of supposed to
you're tall and don't want it to be like
that showing probably get the
medium/large version I just didn't want
it to be like too loose I don't you know
what I mean so yeah that's that then I
got this private party a sweatshirt it
just says New York and it's this grey
color and they have a bunch of like fun
sweatshirts too that are like graphic
print date or have like words or
whatever and em I got one that's a baby
girl and I'm like I wish I got that like
it's like light blue this is baby girl
so I got a couple things from coral and
coral it's just this website that has a
bunch of cool like workout wear and
stuff like that and I didn't read that
before but I saw that Tasha got stuff
from them so
I wanted to try it out I just thought
this white little sports bra top to go
with these white leggings and I don't
have any white leggings so I'm super
excited to try out white leggings and I
really like the way they look together
as like a little say no to SoulCycle and
be like look at me in my white little
workout outfit and I just got these
black leggings from them as well that
have some like leather details on them
so yeah and if you didn't notice I don't
have those with me because couple things
I wanted to bring back to Boston from my
house in New York I didn't want to bring
it to LA if that makes sense so I left
them in a bag in New York so Lucy could
bring them back to Boston for me but
then she forgot the bag so I'm missing
all sorts of things right now like my
winter coat it just it's so a hard time
couldn't show you that coral stuff like
holdin on my hands but luckily I already
film the Tryon part of it so you can see
like what they look like in whatever I
don't have those linked down below as
well I've made an order from Nordstrom
Rack actually over break because I just
like I don't utilize that website enough
it's like Nordstrom but stuff that sale
I got the Tommy Hilfiger swatch with
that Emma and Maggie both got for
Christmas and it's just like this gray
zip-up sweatshirt that has stars on the
sleeves and you guys probably saw me
wearing it like a million times in LA
Lucy's borrowing it right now because
it's really comfy and cute so I don't
have it with me to show you in person
but I really like that then I got these
black leggings from adidas and I don't
have any adidas leggings but my friend
Kendall
banjee spray I saw her wearing these
once and I was like those are so cute
and they just Sadie this really big on
the leg and it's different than stuff I
would normally wear it just says added'
is really large on the leg but I thought
it was really cool when Kendall was
wearing them so I ordered them and I
liked them then I ordered a bunch of
Adidas socks which who cares about
seeing socks they're just a bunch of
socks cuz I always lose my socks they
literally disappear oh and then I got
this pink
Nike sports bra which is really cute and
I need to get new sports bras because oh
did I even tell you I love it can get
twos in their leggings and this actually
thing is a four but now I normally try
to get sixes in their sports bras
because I have boobs now and I'm not
used to it and I need sports bras that
my boobs don't fall out of and when I
was at double-a I could get two sports
bras and I still have all my sports bras
and size two from a lemon and my boobs
literally fall out so check my Poshmark
probably some of my two sports bras will
need to be sold very soon so yeah I
think that was it
for my fun little cozy hall with you
guys I hope you enjoy thanks for
watching I'll see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
