will like mix up our names come on now
we have two different color hair but um
I mean my hair has been like blonde and
brown and blonde and brown like a lot of
different times but still some people
mix us up which is stupid well we'll say
you look really like you don't look like
at all but I listen you could talk okay
I was older me I am older by minute okay
which is better at sports this one we do
the same sport okay we row crew but Lucy
is stronger than me show them your
muscles she is stronger than me
so she's better than we had crew and
she's therefore better at sports we're
like this statement running like our
mile times are actually one second apart
which is so weird anyway look Russians

twin siblings I mean relatives yeah no

your mom have you naturally oh no okay
well no because no moving on okay do you
have your own language no no we don't
have our own language um
do you dress alike no when we are
younger we did we our parents address us
as like matching clothes which is like
kind of weird and embarrassing but um we
have the same style now yeah we really
do have the same style though
like today she's wearing my jean jacket
and today you're wearing my shirt oh
yeah and that's her shirt but um yeah we
have like the same style so do you ever
switch places no well now we can't cuz I
have one hair but like so many people
like I always wanted we don't even look
like so you would really tell us apart
and like a second um
twin telepathy no not really no but okay
it's weird because recently you will be
like like I'll do something or I'll say
I'll say okay like okay we'll be at a
restaurant and Lucy will order something
and I'll be like that's what I was gonna
order and we'll be like whoa we're like
twigs and that our friend Amelia like a
crow and stuff I like will do something
that's really alike and I'm like oh my
god Lucy we're like so twins like
recently we've been doing so much stuff
that's like so similar or we'll say
something the same at the same time and
we're like whoa and my friend amazed
like it's because you are twins and she
gets so mad but yeah so do you feel each
other's pain we haven't really broken
anything yes I had well you broken like
your finger but like a finger like how
my finger like no no we don't feel each
other's pain
do you like being a twin yeah kind of
sometimes depends depends once in a
while sometimes we'll be best friends
did we actually pull boys and me
watching movies but sometimes we hate
each other and we seriously physically
beat each other up like she can she can
beat the crap out of me she's strong
yeah and tell Gretchen starts kicking
 around so yeah those were all the
questions we had for our twin tag and I
wanna like like spice it up with our own
things too like what else let's go with
personality I feel like at school okay
all the time I'm really like outgoing
and like crazy would you say yeah and
okay at home at home Lucy's like talking
nonstop like in my ears like filling my
ears with her knowledge but at school at
school she's more like quiet and
reserved and I get no sleep yeah
everyone thinks that she said grumpy but
at school at school everywhere I'm just
like I'm Lucy's like kind of reserved
but at home she's like loud too like me
and my family and my our friend friends
