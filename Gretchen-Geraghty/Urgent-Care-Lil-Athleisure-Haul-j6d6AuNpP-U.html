morning it is 102 p.m. by something like
probably 11:30 at gobos 12:00 because if
you can't tell I feel so ill why am I
always sick you're probably gonna get
annoyed I think people people literally
even know it in the comments are like I
feel like you are always sick and like I
am and I think it's just because I know
it's just because I travel so much I
don't seem as much as I said I really
try to sleep though but I feel like I
followed into 13 I'm like not sleeping
for a couple days I don't like not
getting enough sleep
and that make up for it and they'll
sleep for like 12 hours in a row like
three days in a row and think I'm okay
but it doesn't really work like that I
think I don't know if you can tell oh my
neck is so like I don't have like a jaw
right now my neck is so swollen my lymph
nodes oh I just made peanut butter toast
so call me dramatic but I think I'm
actually gonna go to Urgent Care with
Lucy in a bit over in Brookline partners
origin carriage ride back I like always
go there when I'm feeling sick because
Student Health is fine whatever at BU
but usually it takes like I'm not
getting a weaker we can have to get an
appointment and by then I like won't be
sick anymore or it'll be like really bad
I don't know I'm sort of scared I just
rap because I've never had strep
actually I never thought I had to rub
before but then my doctor told me at the
end of this summer when I went back and
was like hey I feel sick she was like oh
yeah like I can tell from your blood
test that you like recently had strep
she's like why did you have strap I was
like what I never had strep so I guess I
actually didn't have it but I did know
that I had it but I always kinda this
always kind of happens like if I just
don't sleep enough I don't want to bore
you but if I don't sleep enough or like
whatever I also like share drinks with
friends like if I'm like out to dinner
or just like during the day like I
always drink other people's water
bottles or let people drink mine which
is probably a bad idea I should probably
stop doing that but are you guys like
that like I'm just like a very sharing
person like I always share food like
I'll eat off of other people's plates
like that tell me and my friends my
family I it's actually really funny
because some families aren't like that
talking in mile-a-minute
and when I was younger my mom being like
yeah like I like one or two do their
with like our aunt and my cousins and
she like just stick a fry off of like my
aunt's plate and she was like people's
families are different but I grew up
like everyone's like reaching of each
others plates like I don't know everyone
just yours that's what I'm trying to say
but um so yeah maybe I like a strap so I
burned my toes
it's definitely burnt it's kind of burnt
I'll eat it though it'll be it'll be
crispy in fine
so yeah Urgent Care it is I think there
was something else I was trying to say I
would say psy attracted like halfway
through my like sentence deal Gretchen
I'm still in Hannah's Tri Delta t-shirt
from her sorority at her school and it's
an extra-large and I freaking love it
it's a dress maybe I'll just wear this
out with like some flip-flops because
it's so long I love and comfy and yeah I
watched like big little live last night
it was great and even though I feel kind
of awful I think I have to make myself
go to Trader Joe's it's actually right
over by the urgent care in Brooklyn
because I have no food here so I'm just
not your that much so then buying food
doesn't make sense but then I eat out
and that's not good and just
I'm a mess okay I'm just going to eat
some peanut butter toast pray for me
it's a little burner but it's still got
it so I'm gonna leave in a sec to go
meet up with Lucy to go to Urgent Care
but first I want to show you these
clothes that I've been waiting to show
you for so long and actually the first
thing I'm wearing it's just his black
sports bra but everything will be
showing you it's from fabletics and I'm
so excited to be working with them thank
you so much fabletics for sponsoring
this video because I've been wanting to
try out their clothes for so long
literally ever since you guys know my
friend here Tasha on YouTube she was
like raving about their like and she's
like Gretchen you look Nia to try them
and they're like two for 24 so I know if
you click the link in the description
box you can it get that deal as well you
literally get two pairs of like these
leggings that feel like Lululemon like
fake nice leggings for $24 like girl let
me know so yeah I'll just start showing
you what I got maybe I'll set you up
right here here we go okay Wow boob City
Am I but I just got this black little
sports bra and I love like the back of
it
how cute right and I'm running so much
of Lululemon but obviously it's like a
lot more affordable so I love that and
then this I got is like a matching set
for like spin you guys know I'm like
crazy with spin and all and SoulCycle oh
I wanted to mention sizing so I know
they're sizing goes from like extra
extra small to like 3x so I like that
there's like so many different size
options for y'all and oh also like these
joggers I got sorry I'm like all of our
plays right now but I also love that
they have like short regular tall
versions because these I had to get in
tall because you guys know I'm like five
nine and they fit perfect and I'm just
like so happy about they have that
sizing options but yeah so then I got
these leggings and just know that like
these are an extra small then normally
in the lemon I get a size 4 um so know
that if you like a size 4 in the lemon
or just like a small I would say in
leggings in general get an extra on
fabletics because I think they tend to
run like a little big but these are just
the leggings I got there like cropped
and they go perfect with this sports bra
I love a little matching pants for spin
it can be so cute so this is what the
sports bra looks like super to our ball
and then these joggers can be just I'm
freaking out
Maggie actually had ones that looked
just like these and so when I saw these
aren't athletics I was like I need them
and I just got them in a small Hall
which is so perfect for me they're like
a white waistband like super stretchy
and comfortable great joggers but you
know what I'm gonna switch into them
right now because I've learned these
sweatpants for like 80 days in a row of
the path like week so I'm gonna switch
into these saying hang out all your back
cooking it bring you to a full-length
mirror so I just want to show you what
these look like onto like they can not
be any shorter so I love that they just
have like the tall version because these
are perfect for more look at I love it
back to show you the last thing from
time lettings just waiting on one key
sorry so these are one of the two for 24
like options and it's extra small hi
Reese of lugging up-and-coming okay yeah
so these are minding me so much of just
like Lululemon high-waisted
wunderlanders or like there are lines
and legit I love that like they're so
thick and stretchy nice okay I wish you
could just feel them but you can
probably like tell how nice these are I
would say they're super comparable to
like they're heavies and runner runners
and obviously if you can get to 424 like
that's freaking insane
don't forget to click the link in the
description so you can do that and I
even know that they look at VIP like
membership thing that you can do if you
want but I know you don't have to and
you take the style quiz and like there's
no pressure if you like don't want to
buy anything one month like you're like
go off and I don't need like a pair of
leggings every month you can just like
skip and then go to the next month or
whatever and not be charged so yeah
basically I love have let --ax I've
wanted to try them out for so long and I
know that like my boo Kate Hudson
started it which is like so cool or she
like it's like a part of it like a
founder or something and a lot of people
actually say I kind of look like her so
through the nose like Kate Hudson's
people have told me that for awhile so
yeah that's part of the reason that I
want to try it cuz I'm like oh wait
that's like my twin over there but um
anyway yeah now I have my like comfy
little athleisure
I like become other stuff is like
athleisure or like actually active
because I think their stuff is like
active lifestyle so yeah let's go scoop

shoes I just got though from what you
McCall I think I showed them yesterday

I just looked at the viewfinder and I
was like well anyway I'm sweating I had
to put my ear but if what he tell me
they did all those dishes I don't know
if I showed them before but it was like
this never done no and I did all of
those in this pan is bigger than my face
no it's nice it works about to get dirty
again
so I did all that who else is the type
of person that when they just think good
they have to tell everyone 80 times I'm
like hey guess what I did the dishes
thank God I don't use it hey just remind
you I did your dishes that's me I love
this song yes jamming I know I take all
of my songs from your playlist yeah I
don't know how Lucy fines for music
honestly just rather playlists or how do
you find your music oh that's how it got
so hot in here so quick
no just because we know that no like the
kitchen it physically hotter it's like
80 degrees over there I'm like sending
him from the window being like so we're
making Lucy's tofu rice and the cake is
done
and normally you guys know we make our
cake in like to circle pans except they
didn't have that Oh three but we had
just one huge pan with this pan is so
big so it took a lot longer to cook so
you could tell we had to shove a knife
event like eight times see if it was
done I want to take like an hour or you
know and now we're making remaking the
prophecy yeah that looks like the sauce
for the rice that soy sauce um oh but if
you're wondering right what the guy at
his watch a bloody nose because I did
okay I would like that was the ratchet
licked it and it must be gone oh that
was so scary it was like right in the
spot of where my nose would bleed honey
home o our tofu who's done roasting and
toasting and that goes in there I'm
pretty sure Lucy I lied I didn't really
strain the rice like he wanted me to
guess how I did it
I just poured on the water out thank you
my lady we don't have a strainer that's
like thin enough for the recipe I was
about to pour it in the strainer no this
dream it would go through through those
little Oh didn't even think of it I was
going in then I was like now I'm too
lazy and I just poured out the water oh
my not if I actually did the way I was
supposed to it would have been a mess
all of our rice would never sink oh my
it lit I wish you could feel the eat me
right now it is like 85 degrees
I clean the whisk I clean everything hey
Lou I did the dishes here down here my
wedding right now okay there's like
clumps of peanut butter okay she goes
I'm gonna use my hands I think we just
need some melting I thought you'd say I
think it just needs a good man's touch
no it needs a melted like I was gonna
put it in the okay I'm not telling
Taylor that we used your hands you can
watch this later and freak out
how's it working out the peanut butter
that they use did three containers of
very mg peanut butter okay containers oh
good the illusion that there's more and
there is so like and you're like oh look
there's like none left in there chunky
looking dog food but what is Wow cooking
is taking forever it's so draining
we also need to go get my antibiotic so
I don't die can you dive some strep
throat someone let me know hi
wait how was your day of studying did
you get so much done oh baby by yourself
there's probably so quiet
damn how is your rice yeah I'm excited
um so Taylor's cake sort of had a mishap
on the way over
well we had to be the peanut butter
frosting on top and then used for
chocolate chips on top but I guess the
cake was still too hot because the
frosting melted and then the chocolate
chips melted and then the tinfoil just
squished them all around but um yeah
it'll still taste good I think when I
got some kombucha and all sorts of other
food I'm cleaning out our fridge and
being such a helpful little lady ground
