Mandy's our cousin our first cousin
she's my mom's sister's daughter
she's actually five never ate No
Mandy is 16 she just turned 16 on
January 15 and Lucy 9 will be 19 soon in
like less than a month which is so scary
but she's our BFF and she dates JT and
she's come Long Island question 1 does
she ever want to make a youtube channel
no no I remember I first started I
wanted you to make one so bad what is
your favorite brand of clothing Mandy
three people three people they have
really cute stuff oh wait PS guys look
it I got my hair done yesterday sorry
not to make this about me
I just noticed and I got my nails in -
do you like them there I n see I don't
know if you have a and C where you live
put the other Y are you struggling what
is your least favorite word in the
entire world and why moist how that's
like Miley say where - people say I'm
just like oh they make C cringe kinda
that's really funny because that's what
I was thinking what is your favorite
thing you ever bought from Lululemon
wonder unders I lost my blasto where
they're um has anyone ever recognized
Mandy out in public for her being on
your channel no no but when Justin was
that my sister's college the other day a
girl recognized him and it was really
funny because he texted me and was like
oh my gosh I just took a picture of
someone so that's funny but people
haven't met maybe that IPOP looks so
right on camera anyway what's the
scariest thing that's ever happened to
you at the lake oh yeah scary sigh
happened everyone to the neck and then
ran me down oh yeah and then graduated
Lucy had to go and my brother had to go
stay at the other house like 45 minutes
away because because our family was
falling apart and they paid they say fit
house that day
we ended up coming back at like 3:00
a.m. that was really scary
I thought you were gonna say when you
were just younger um Randall
Manny's older brother and Lucy and me
would always say scary stories Mandy
would flip out she just cried she liked
stuff and I'd be like me all we would be
like is ghosts or like possessed people
and she'd be like no cuz I couldn't we
were little man's family weren't even
friends it was like loosely and Mandy
were friends yeah and I was just friends
with Randall and I was like Mandy's a
baby and she said it wasn't even friends
with her but now obviously we're like
BFFs for life so and said do we ever go
double dating I wish we did like JT
making me a Justin but like we don't
because Mandy lives far away but that
would be really fun but we don't are you

you what is it like being cousins with a
youtuber I could leave the same guys -
link funny when I first started YouTube
Mandy and I had a bet she thought that I
was not gonna make it anywhere in life
and she was like this is like pathetic
kind of like you weren't that mean but
you were like lol like nothing's gonna
happen to this and we had a bet that
within a year um I said I would try to
get a thousand subscribers in a year and
she's like there's no way you'll get
like ten and I ended up getting like a
couple thousand so we were like whoa
like I won the bet pretty much what is
your most embarrassing moment um well
pretty much anything in school if I can
talk out loud my face gets bright red I
mean when I'm not in there I always gets
bright right if I'm speaking oh my god

bit more about Mandy we got in so many
fights that - we did do remember you

the shorts at the lake oh my god DIY DIY
when I was a young guy we would wake up
although our whole day would be like
short short short swim and then we wake
up we had or different cares guys we
didn't drive so we would make them take
us to go buy I didn't even fit us we
would buy high-waisted mom jeans and
then cut them off into shorts and bleach
them indictable in different colors and
