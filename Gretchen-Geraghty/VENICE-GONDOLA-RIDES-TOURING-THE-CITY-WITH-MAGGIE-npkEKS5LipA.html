I'll show you guys what they look like
when she put them on okay guys I had
convinced I found it mix of white gold
and gold you said yeah and then the
bracelet that goes with that
oh my gosh and what she said is you can
make the necklace longer if you don't
wanna wear the bracelet you can make a
link them together that looks so good
and it's like Maggie such a bad
influence
putting the David Yurman in retiring
goodbye David Yurman see you later and
this one needs to be cleaned so about it
so dirty you can feel how hot it is
oh look at this
Cuba area we're gonna explore and I
still need to put on my jewelry so you
can see what it looks like on me the
Magyars herd is where I put my hand on
the pony
because I just screwed my ponytail hair
came out where it's tiny yeah oh I got
caught on my we bring put all these
rings me and Maggie need to stay away
from jewelry looking
and these those are cool
Maggie's getting your trailer you can
show him this so he can see when you
were getting it oh my god I know coz if
I put it in mind he's like you told me
see it but she needs some alone cuz he
has like a breed of other Belton that's
like falling apart he would tell us
about mom and baby Bella yeah so what is
handmade in Italy that's that's really
cool I like this is there just one teeny
bit more block I think this birthday
guys all these other bags are so cool I
really like the leather one with the red
white and green we like everything and
all these wallets there's all these
furry pom pom things I wonder if these
are real for ooh these are definitely
real for they feel like real fur dad
don't watch this video because I think I
want to get this for you for Father's
Day
it's a leather black wallet and it's
real genuine Venice leather
I was thinking how I wanted to get him a
want her father said there's something
cool from Italy this is big enough or
just he want this one that has like the
flippy part I don't know if it Philippi
would bother me so I would get this one
guys I'm getting my mom this scarf she
loves like these little scarves and she
ties around her neck and she looks so
fashionable and it's so and it's our
Venice like so pretty and when they flex
harder on your neck you can't really see
the picture you just see the colors but
it's beautiful
I love that guys we're seeing so much
cool like stuff today okay I think
hi okay guys I'm sitting down first
I can show how long said the card yet I
know I thought of that when she gave us
the box oh there we go there all the way
down there
I can they see in this sound it's like
sparkling it's so pretty
and I don't understand how I think
they'd cut it then they look like really
shining it's almost like diamonds but
they're like they not it's because the
white and yellow gold is like cut raw I
got white gold and yellow gold yep for
the necklace here it is can you see it
oh my gosh my knees been labeled tape is
start starting to not stick which is
becoming an issue but it's so sunny out
I love and this is what can you see the
little tiny bracelet here I'll try to
separate it mine
yeah right there and they match and
they're so cute and I laugh
I know we got to find a good picture
spot looking okay this is a cool spot we
were talking about and we literally just
walked back here okay that was easy okay
let's take pictures quick before we like
get in trouble or something in this
mirror hey girl
No
what's your name Antonia
antonio is driving us driving what are
you doing paddling
antonio citizens retired and he thought
that it goes straight with
that's the legit where we just were
taking pictures
now we're going to an island it's either
called Marana Moroni I think it's home
of our own corona or Bharata I just
gotta have a cheese that we like yeah I
didn't get that yesterday we just hope
good for you see Butler Caprice whatever
you say but um I really like Bharata
because it's like the mozzarella that's
like more squishy in the middle you know
I like that and I just realized we need
a gosh darn cannoli this is so good
thank you taking a picture of us I'm so
happy we're here Maggie
it's so cool look at all the buildings
okay always on your phone I'm cool yeah
she was placing my picture so get off
her case also if anyone comes here you
better go on the gondolas because those
really really cruel that was Toby in the
gondola also the thing when you're on a
ski mountain and you go up the gondola
yeah how is there those two gondolas are
so so different well anyway go on the
gondolas here they're really cool I hope
you didn't Tony oh he was a gem in all
the different buildings this is so
pretty yes
this reminds me of Rainbow Rowell in
South Carolina guys if you've ever been
there I'm not so pretty
okay all the colorful buildings on the I
can't really see because of this fun but
you can see these things down here and
it's so pretty and we just have the
lines and then we Maggie are gonna go
find bridges to take pictures on you
know the colorful buildings the you have
to our guide Tyson and the people that
you have just know that we like want to
take a picture so bad so they're always
like go over here for pictures or go
like do this so and yeah it's just
really hot out nice out I like
underestimated how hot it would be here
in Italy on this trip you know yeah but
it's been good like I love the warm
weather and I'm really happy we have
rompers and hair ties this cute little
table yeah
I'm looking out prettiest oh man
and that's the really crowded bridge
over there that we used to go to man
he's gonna get this handmade bag it's so
pretty
I don't think they can even see the
color that well but it took was know
Italy like reddish orange it's like not
showing up on the camera that well and
it's really cool white and I found this
little blue one that's like it I wish it
was small like the blue one no really
yeah
I like that it's big and you like
carrying a lot of stuff like my camera
yeah and this I like I just don't know
if I would use it you know it's cute and
their hands mean in Italy
Maggie's like imagine telling someone
that I was handmade in Italy my gosh
wait this is like the prettiest about
all the different colors being real tell
them to go watch my voice I'm I'm too
scared too
next thing take a picture of him her
vlog with him but obviously would not
say anything to anyone okay anyway
moving on from this subject um he was
talking here yeah yes yes Maggie is such
a good sense of direction and I know
that I have really good common sense not
telling it burst I own I bagged weight
this place is cute
Oh what I was saying is Tyson was
telling us um oh I hear that if you live
here you have to like by law you can't
change the color of any houses so you
better like you don't wonder
you better like the one that you live in
because you can't change it because
coming this time they're probably like
we're over reminding them that it's time
to go let's see if they come or not
so we're by all the luxury stores right
now we literally just walk by like all
of them but then the other Gucci it's
right over here oh yeah this is a big
one that makes sense so they said they
had 180 left which is Maggie size from
about across your fingers because it
might be dawn don't guys we just found a
nugget why haven't I never seen her
she's probably maybe the one that they
have here you know okay they're probably
gonna get mad at me for filling so I'm
not really gonna film anymore because
it's weird to film in here but it's kind
of crowded today so I guess it's okay
now we're on a water taxi and we're
gonna sip maybe I shouldn't move down
it's like golden hour right now
we're gates nine and Maggie was waiting
so long for me because I was like laying
in bed and couldn't move because I'm so
tired but when you've given up and have
to make an outfit to go to dinner for
people jacket white shoes and none of it
goes together oh my gosh because I took
a couple sips and this is going like
right through me
so I got the truffle oil pasta and it
literally tastes like a bottle of
truffle and look I really like truffle
but it's a lot but it's still good
I'm Maggie gone I don't even know what I
forget but she's not really a doubt
about it's not like that in the picture
was like merely like red sauce and then
like I couldn't even explain to you the
flavor it's kind of different but you
know
obviously put seaweed in here it's just
like not what we're used to here I mean
it's like when you go to Mexico this
angle hi guys Gretchen's you know we
decided that Gretchen doesn't end off
her vlog she kinda just puts like text
over the screen in stock by actually she
waited so I'm an analogue like I enough
