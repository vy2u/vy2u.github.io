see myself anymore because I use this
one yeah morning Lucy darling so I'm
visiting Justin today I know so weird
people know there's people they can see
me well right now we're going Starbucks
so that's exciting
wahoo I'm so hungry I definitely want
chocolate
I'm a fan
wait is that yogurt no thank you
I'm just gonna meet Microsoft I'm not
croissant wait yeah these across no II
it is yeah I don't know I feel like it's
a it's not a croissant but it is a four
song you know Amelia if you're watching
this right now I'm thinking of you cuz I
got your eyes I'm so excited to see
Justin this is great he's getting so mad
at me that I'm vlogging but I decided
I'd be good way to make him be in it
yeah so I'm waiting at the to stop right
now
and yeah I'm just really excited to go
see Justin I didn't really explain it
before but I'm going to see Justin today
and I'm just going for the day and for
those of you that always ask we don't go
to the same College we're not broken up
his college is not too too far for mine
so luckily I can get there by the T and
yeah I'm just really excited to see him
and hopefully he'll be in some of this
vlog and then I just went to Starbucks
with Taylor and mkhaya and Taylor's my
best friend from home like I thought you
guys asked called you Taylor's and she's
just one of my best friends from home
and she goes to Boston University with
Lucy and I and then Mackay is my
roommate and she rose too so yeah we
just went to Starbucks and now I'm
missing Justin I'm like so excited like
I feel like such a noob but I mean it's
kind of more special to when you don't
get to see your boyfriend or girlfriend
as much and then you do get to see them
like I think it makes it that much more
special so yeah and I'm wearing my new
how's it going you guys it's gonna be a
haul video either before or after this
vlog but it's just the white fluffy one
you guys didn't notice - look I feel
more uncomfortable like I feel weird
vlogging at college just because in high
school I was kind of like whatever like
I don't care well I get college there's
so many people around and yeah like
right now like I don't know I'm like in
the middle of combat and there's so many
people around wow guys I really suck I
just realized that entire last clip
wasn't me cutting off my face and plus
it was like not focused on me it was
like focused on behind me so I'm really
sorry if I'm like bad I doing this but I
mentioned this in like a vlog before
that my front camera and my phone is
kind of like wonky I don't know why it's
like takes videos funny now so I have to
use like this back camera so like I
can't see myself so that's why I look at
the video it's funny family cutting off
my face or whatever
here I think you can't even see you
really look you say hi hello
he's very around are they what that
happen yeah I don't know if I can even
see me though can they see me right now
I think it's better like this way right
because in the way it's kind of on me so
you like blurry on your face
guys I know this is blurry I know this
is blurry but I'll give you a quick
update if you saw those few Clips before
this was me on the tee and I looked
really sad and it's because Justin
this was my bed right now it's alright
enough thirsty
I did it on once it
that's not one set well I mean in one I
didn't come up for air are you so proud
this is a water wasted it it's all in my
tummy
I don't be dehydrated what you have
issues can I make you look I like that
shirt a lot I forget where we last left
it off
Justin I realized I have doing this and
it like cuts off my eyes right
I didn't realize so I kept cutting off
my face but um if you saw those clips
before I felt myself on the tee I was
down here I was like because I like I
basically gave myself so much time to
get to where I needed to be to get to
Justin's on time that was mean
but I like the tea got messed up in
their construction stuff so it took me
way way longer than I'm supposed to and
it gave myself were you proud of me I
gave myself like an extra half an hour
in case I was like running late or
something I did and so basically the
shuttle to take us back to Justin's
College was supposed to be there well it
was there at 11:30
but then my tea got in like 11:35 so we
were like so stressed but then luckily
the nice shuttle driver waited for me so
that was nice I probably so gross right
now I like fell asleep my hair probably
is like icky hopefully you can see my
eyeballs cuz I know I'm really bad at
that I always cut them off all good
Justin I just ordered so much boat and
I'm so excited we're watching the Rams
Justin's eugenio football I learned what
it feels go Liz
we do they even know you want a haircut
guys look out looks it was so long
before it definitely needed a cut I was
so surprised that you actually got to
cut long hairs better on girls
remember when I got it cut short and you
hated me do it I dare you throw it at me
give me your best shot your socks with
converses yeah cuz they don't weigh
Congress's narrows your inner social do
you oh I could do you guys wear socks
with your converse sorry I don't know
those I got you them from Banana
Republic remember
Oh mind the best girlfriend ever oh yeah
so we ordered a bunch of pizza from
dominos I haven't had pizza and so on is
it zoomed down my face
oh it's cuz I zoomed in on your face so
for now I'm phone cuz I just drink that
whole water that how you fought my
stomach feels full okay
was the lighting this good the other way
see like you can actually see me now I
apologize but this way is blurry can you
like look at your face here it's kind of
blurry yes I swear it's blurry the front

camera aid made it kind of messed up or
something you know Justin gave me I
showed it or I don't know this is gonna
go up before after the whole video but I
showed it now okay I'm gonna stop
filming on this camera cuz I know it's
