the balloon place and pick up 40
balloons because 40 balloons won't fit
in this car I just like love surprising
people and write people's birthdays like
JC Smith birthday and all day and I was
in such a good mood because I was just
like a fake birthday
it's a great day to be alive I don't
know I just love birthdays now I care so
we're at Panera right now okay so listen
to this I'm actually so pissed we went
to delete the balloons and the girls
like it's here and I'm like no I ordered
them there was 40 balloons rainbow color
to be exact
he's supposed to be ready and she was
like no there's no balloons and yeah she
goes did you order from the right um the
right like store I was like pretty sure
and then she goes oh look at and she
pulls out like this I blog back like
full of rainbow blue and started my nose
is really dry and peeling and she's like
oh and she's like do you have time like
we're gonna have to fill them all up and
I was like oh my god Hong is this gonna
take
so Lucy no I just came to Panera and ate
dinner I should have shown you but
they're empty
cuz we're pigs and scarf down our salads
and shout out my BFF Craig who's working
here right now you're the best anyways
so we just ate our salads and now we
have to go get the balloons hopefully
they're ready freakin store I hate
people on top of their really
pisses me off
whatever we shouldn't be too off
schedule Lucy likes your water's lemon
and Mizpah Nerys full I'm just talking
to myself and people are looking but you
think so sad okay little day full of
surprises is going to plan faith was
very surprised with her cupcakes and she
liked them a lot and now I'm really
excited to see his reaction because
we've literally been planning it for a
month
like I hope she's so surprised and is
like hi welcome to Sarah Brad where we
always
yes Greg I I'm in the car now with like
all the freaking balloons so I'm sitting
in the back I'm holding all the balloons
I did it oh that's it but Lucy on the
other hand
so just a glistening probably like 20
minutes to get it all together but look
at how it came out I'm so excited this
is just how I pictured it and it's just
like a million of these colored balloons
with all these pictures be careful
though we have to be really careful or
out the pictures starting to fall or the
helium stops working and they start to
like fall to the ground and guess what
we did what we figured out we figured
out if you rub the balloon against your
head and kiss all staticky then you can
just stick it to the ceiling to the
ceilings or you can tape it to the
ceiling
if you really wanted to be secure
because that's what we do for some of
them okay she just called me she just
called me she's here I'm so nervous I
really hope you liked oh my god I'm
freaking out
I've never been so excited or nervous or
something I know this seems like crazy
but I don't know I've just been really
excited about it for a while so yeah I
gotta go cuz she's here but we should be
like somebody helium is going away yeah
