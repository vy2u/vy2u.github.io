and sorry I might send my song because I
had them on when I went in because we
had practice karate yoga too so we went
we bro this morning for two hours and
then we just went out yoga and I'm like
so tired but Lucy said all rowing
practice host he thought about we're
cold oranges and how she really wanted
to oranges so now we're actually going
to a market near our house to get
oranges because she wants foreign but I
just thought I would love today because
you guys like when I'm vlogging Mandy is
visiting and we have a fun day plan
because both of us don't have to
lifeguard today so it's really cool all
three of us are gonna like go shopping
and we started to go to Chipotle for
lunch so we've been so excited all
Minnie's been talking I was like I can't
wait till we go to Chipotle tomorrow she
has this like special order that she
gets that she's got me like hooked on
and I get it every time I go and it's so
plain it's like five things but I guess
I'll just tell you like when we get
there all about it I'll probably talk
about more anyway oh my gosh good news I
finally did my eyebrows yesterday I
didn't do them for the longest time and
they really
but that's besides my we're like so
happy Mandy's visiting just be like love
her so much and I mentioned Mandy all
the time and I don't even know if you
guys know but we seem you're 18 and
Mandy is only 15 she's actually three
years younger than us and we live
growing up with her as our cousin
so we've like always been so close to
her and we just like feel like she's
already Jenny might just buy one get one
pray you should get one I don't know
each other moms are good it is cold
let's get him Lucy what just happened at
the grocery let me see one debate with
their credit card but Lucy didn't have
her credit card so I had to run back to
the car and save the day
get money we only want to know oranges
and we walked out with two containers
bras berries two watermelons or
oh she is always right
so I know we sounded really healthy when
I said all that through we just got but
then we just got bagels too so if we go
to this bagel place like in our town
your high school and stuff like it's
literally reunion there's always people
there in the mornings fact like from our
high school so we just saw like four or
five different people it's like hey
never gonna see you again probably
unless we go to this bagel place I got
12 green bagel with peanut butter YUM
you're like half begging also guys I'm
going out to dinner with Justin tonight
we're going with Justin and his family
so he's mom and dad and Jacqueline's his
older sister and she's been in bulks and
Aiden is her boyfriend so we're all
gonna go do this this song is so weird
like why can't you feel your face you
know I can't feel my face when I'm with
you
I'm gonna make a list of all her pet
peeves she has so many things that look
bother her one thing is I always have
the air out in the car if you get stung
back because she just wants the windows
down he does the question is a great day
out
yeah I know I do like having run us down
because then I can act except one of you
left a really mean comment on my last
vlog and was like why are you being a
puppy it's not funny and it's stupid and
you wanna know why I'm puppy is because
my true inner soul is puppy so that's
why I'm a puppy
it's still also someone commented in my
last vlog it was like how are you
getting probably write all these songs
because I like oh you just play music in
the car you know and then I like talk
about it or like sing with it or
whatever so like can you need popularity
of songs are playing in the car yeah I
didn't think you could like it out for
two weeks what I do is a lot of you ask
- I will have like popular music playing
but look if I talk over it doesn't get
copyrighted so I don't know I like gonna
get in trouble but yeah I don't know
anyways we're almost home Andy's going
to sleep in all morning long while Lucy
and I left at like 6:30 to go to
practice and not yoga she's spent living
in now at 11:15
my voice is kind of gone right now you
guys commented in video before someone
says something mean and was like why
would you film a video of your boy
sounds like that like sorry I like
filming video I don't know I think it's
when I'm tired or like sick we got our
wisdom teeth out on last Thursday and
Friday I got mine on Thursday she got
his got Friday he saw those videos it's
been a week and we are like just getting
better like I had a really high fever
for a while and I had to go on like all
these medicines and Lucy her medicine
made her really sick and threw up
all good morning sunshine yeah oh yeah
you have a wild mane I was insane
immortal but actually like all the time
hmm that's the only thing I wished it
would be yummy guys if it's a motorman
Anna it's clearly
GLB so I showered and whoa I kind of
like blend in with the walls but right
now I'm just filming clips in front of
Lucy's white closet all my clothes on
the ground I'm filming a haul video
today so that's really exciting and like
try and almost honestly take me so long
to edit because what you have to do is
you have to go through and like edit it
like normal but then you also have to
insert all the videos of the clothes
that you're wearing into it so it takes
like such a long time but I like doing
it because I know you guys like
triangles better than normal ones anyway
don't worry I'll like do my hair and
makeup and stuff before I film the howl
video of my voice almost sounds like
it's getting worse so I just found a
whole video sitting right there except
for that door was closed
now I'm getting yelled at because
they're gonna leave without me to go to
Chipotle in the mall and we're so hungry
cuz I took forever to get ready and film
everything I found my necklace like I
was in my whole video I'm so happy
because I lost this little elephant guy
and then I found him in my pool bag so
that's really good and yeah we got to go
now cuz we're hungry I'm just trying to
import my footage really quick cuz
usually takes really long time
they make me say
in the back because they don't love me
we put Katherine at the video Katherine

oh it's upper side I was her finger she
was saying skinny bitches like like

really well usually doesn't really like
being in them so I was like whatever
he's not gonna be in it again like if he
doesn't want to be like I you know I can
just do my own thing and then today I
was like I'm blogging today and he was
like oh my god I want to be like trying
on and I was like what is wrong with you
he was like I want to be in and I was
like like I don't know any suddenly
wants to be in it's weird
but I guess if he wants to be in it I
will take the opportunity while tea or
so maybe a blinging song today's vlog
who knows and right now my bloopers
should be uploading up are you guys and
he's in those tones
he'll probably like that video all do

I just got home like he's a little cutie
if you understood from that little clip
I was showing you um we went to dinner
and then we went to the racino and I
didn't really walk that much with like
Joe's and his parents and Jacqueline
needed
I think Justin took like one little clip
of Jack eliminated so that's that was
but yeah I didn't want like without my
phone at dinner or anything and then we
went to this I don't really want to say
like where we live up now but went to
this place Rica Mike Campbell basically
if you're from near where I live you
know I'm talking about and it was fine
never been to like a casino like that
before um but it was cool
we like lost money won money and then
basically broke even but like we don't
really like I don't know like it's not
like I can't below the time I was like
the first time I ever gambled ever and I
Campbell ten dollars so no worries there
