she only drives like I just vlog that
the timesheets driving because
when I drove obviously I'm driving well
so it's really snowing sleet really
hoping first snow day but clearly they
took half man and now we're driving to
school in the snow and the roads are not
that clear so we really should not
forget the snow
in retaliation I'm wearing pretty crappy
clothes but that's like what I generally
do because you even cares anyways
so so yeah I Drive sometimes too it just
depends on the day
Lucy and I will just hijack an off the
granted I have a friend children begging
to because I thought I wouldn't have
school
so Gretchen show me yeah I'll be like
didn't do a lot of stuff through your
positive we weren't connect school we do
no delay or anything so that's that's a
pretty terrible but I'm drinking my own
coconut water I only have like five
classes spare get out super early so
I have too much editing to do for this
real Australia or or maybe the Bahamas
because I was really about to venture
out into the cold and snowy day guys do
you see this it's snowing so hard and
they canceled after-school activities
again and we didn't even have a delay or
snow day or anything today but we're
really really hoping that we get a snow
day tomorrow and yeah if you haven't
noticed this scarf has been in like my
past probably a million videos I'm
pretty much obsessed with it and it's
really warm and cozy so that's why I've
been wearing it so much outfit repeater
and I run my huge long coat it's
literally light like it's so nice I'm
seriously like vlogging in our school
park parking lot right now look how
weird I'm like magnets because it is
made me totally like ruthless is that
three word look I really don't care
where I vlog or anything I know look at
how coolly like we look like complete
Eskimos like like people eating this but
like yeah we're the real winners because
we're warm and toasty when everyone else
is freezing your butts off
so yeah snow just makes look super happy
and we're gonna go home and go make
 brownies and yarn at sweaty
brownies they're the best thing ever our
car so snowy uh-oh but um yeah we're
gonna go make some brownies you
just have a grand old handling
okay I just like we got in the car and I
decided to vlog again because I'm in
just such a good business like we're
driving with snow I know it feels really
different this is Lucy's my first first
like year driving with snow so it's
gonna be like first time it's gonna be
interesting but we're careful drivers we
should be good and what are we doing now
Lu Slater brownies with the yummies
thing ever they have cookie dough all in
the bottom of the pan and then you cover
the cookie dough with Oreos and then on
top of that you pour brownie batter so
it's like cookies and then Oreos and
then brownies and it's just so yummy
it's like the tastiest thing ever we
just went to the grocery and got some
 brownie stuffing also - I don't
know why but Lucy and I in the grocery
we like it's like going into target like
we walk out with like way more food than
Mimi and I don't know why we're like
children and we just like look at all
the candy and like
do knock or the research hungry we were
like we need this we need that watering
over like we got like two things of ice
cream and it's like snowing out like and
and OMG practice got cancelled so we're
just gonna have a super fun night and
just like make brownies and like
not too a homework and pretend that we
have a snow day again because that
always works out in our benefit just
like today right I said yesterday at my
blog miss that I feel like I just
complain all the time I'm like really
sorry if I'm just like why don't I win
but yeah I say positive usually update
update
I think we're getting our Christmas tree
on Saturday so that's cool
I'll vlog again later when we're making
our little bloody brownies but they're
like super yummy and sometimes there's
like an Oreo or two left in the
container that you can eat oh yeah guys
literally look at this the roads are so
there's so bad if we have school
tomorrow and me really mad here and you
put cookies in the bottom you got the
same and then you take your box of Oreos
and you put it like that and you just
cover it do it it's Oreos now your
cookie dough in the bottom and then I
Laura's on how we made like cuts above
and then moosie is going to pour the
brownie mix on top yum yum yum yum yum
just in case you were wondering we use
the nicely Toll House cookie dough it
came like in the little squares you know
and we just use a thing of Oreos and
then and then this is the brownie mix we
used it was like Ghirardelli chocolate
the supreme very mixed and I'm waiting
for blog miss day 9 to upload it's
taking a really long time
sorry I would like take it up the vlog
missus around like 3 or 4 p.m. maybe
even two cuz I thought that's just a
good time it's like earlier enough in
the days when we can see them and now
it's ready 6:30 but yeah I'm not trying
my best guys I want until you know how
ours
bad news came in on and the answer is so
yummy and so I tried to like zoom in a
lot
there's the cookie part on the bottom
and then the oreo part and then the
brownie part in there literally so good
so yeah that was basically dinner and I
know it's actually really crazy because
I put up like what I eat in a day and
like I ate healthy for a really long
time and then recently I've just been
eating like pizza and brownies and stuff
but sometimes I still eat healthy so
when I showed you like bad food I eat it
just cuz I'm eating with yummy food that
I'm like sharing with you but yeah
anyway these turned out really good and
also I'm like currently in denial and
like refuse to be doing my homework
because I like don't want to go to
school tomorrow and like technically we
could have a snow day because the roads
are pretty awful instance knowing law
but I heard it might look clear by the
morning so we probably will have school
I'm not gonna get at my hopes like I did
in yesterday's vlog miss if you didn't
see how happy I was yesterday I was very
happy I was like screaming out like
nowadays about it and we didn't even get
delay so try not to get my hopes up but
maybe we'll get it to Leigh who knows or
snow day that would be nice so yeah I'm
just gonna like edit videos maybe
starting for my huge biology test
because that would be the smart thing to
do so this was going to be the end of
vlogmas day 10 oh my god this is a
sketch right now this is going to be the
end of locusts day 10 I hope you enjoyed
let's pray for some snow even though we
like never get snow days yeah let's pray
anyway and I'll see you tomorrow in
Wagle stay alert</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
