always make us breakfast

ratchet Matheny like you're right if
he's going out but hey that I would vlog
this magical moment okay
thank you for vlogmas day 12 this is
just gonna go at the very beginning
because I forgot to do my question of
the day earlier which is what is your
biggest regret and why and yeah I just
think this is like a really interesting
question just to hear what you guys have
regretted in the past and maybe some of
your older than me it'll give me some
inspiration of what I should be doing
and if there's one thing that I really
regret from the past it might be I used
to play flute so quitting flute was kind
of like a touchy subject my parents
really didn't want me to quit and I
almost feel like now I wish I didn't
quit because it'd be fun to still like
play in the band and everything and like
play when I'm older so yeah my one
regret would be quitting flew and what
are your guys regrets comment down below
I made some really bad for me like this
cuz I mean I don't like show you guys
and I made like happy but I just am
eating really yeah music happy Friday
candy-ass be obsessed with her
guys who else loves this song from
Charlie's Angels be for real
guys I realized yesterday's vlog mix was
up around 10:00 p.m. and partially it
was due to I don't know why I was taking
so long to load like literally to export
out of iMovie took like over an hour and
then to put it on YouTube took like
another hour I don't know why it took
forever and also because I do finish
editing it until kinda later cuz I just
didn't finish it the day before which
it's kind of messy but yeah I've just
been really really busy with obviously
kind of like it's taking over my life
but I mean I don't mind like I love
doing it for you guys so that's why I
was up later but I'm really gonna try to
get him up with earlier in the day oh my
gosh I want to mention something would I
show you that comment one of you
commented and it's actually so awful
it's what kind of funny but like
terrible they said they tried like
peanuts and bananas or peanut butter and
banana like for the first time and they
don't logic reaction like guys I think
like if you have an allergic reaction I
don't know I just feel so bad but she's
like the things I do for GLD so I
thought that was funny but like
obviously allergic reactions are not
funny at all and I'm really happy that
you're like okay and like still alive
and I hope you're doing well
so yeah I'm really sorry thank you him
allergic reaction how did you need to
address that because I was like oh my
gosh I can't believe that happened
so yeah huge peanut butter please don't
eat peanut butter and banana as good as
it is because I yeah you probably didn't
know that you were allergic to peanut
butter so at least you know right yeah
I know no I'm happy you're okay oh
what'd you just tell me I made a video
well I was like I've got someone in the
vlog me spirit their struggle when
there's holes in here and your boots and
