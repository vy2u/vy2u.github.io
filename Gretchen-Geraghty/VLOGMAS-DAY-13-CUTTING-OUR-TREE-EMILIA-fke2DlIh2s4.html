Christmas tree of the season so pretty
look at how big they forget cheese

about it there's a brown spot but it's
okay there's faults in everyone
everyone's a little on the inside okay
mom you're five nine and look at how big
it is baby I'm excited I wanted to guess
when they had I think we found the
biggest one okay and look at from this
side it's really okay this can be the
front hop over the creek I'll get the
mountains

fell on mommy it's working
sliding into diems like hey look at you

Hey
the bark of the bomb
name
tired
so it's me from girl code in the
relationship video if I don't watch it
it's really embarrassing
we just watched interstellar I said it
right
and it was really confusing and it made
me change my view on life I'm confused I
bet you a bunch of the viewers that are
watching this right now saw it yeah like
what do you guys think about it was kind
of scary I read a bunch of candy you
know I have to date thirteen already
alright five dogmas so as you just
thought Emilia and I went to
interstellar and I just tweeted about it
it was actually like crazy and like
totally mind-blowing like maybe I like a
different outlook on like that sounds
extreme but I don't know that movie just
like messed with my head I don't know
but anywho I just got home and honestly
my Saturday night is looking pretty lame
I'm probably gonna do some homework and
try to edit some videos cuz I get so
behind and editing it's really bad I'm
gonna go to hot yoga tomorrow
and try to do some homework just editing
I think Justin comes home tomorrow night
from a soccer game right so that's
really fun and I think I can see him in
beginning yeah and someone sometimes not
involvement was like do you never see
Justin do you never hang out with him
like no I do I just said before like I
just he doesn't really want to be on
camera and I told it respect that so
that's why he's not in vlogmas but i do
hang out with him still so that's good
I'm really fun today getting our
christmas tree actually tired me out a
lot because we had to like drag it all
the way through the orchard net the
orchard like the before is basically and
then yeah right as I got home I just
went to the movie so that was really fun
and I got to catch up with me I and we
went on a little date so I'm just gonna
end up vlogmas day 13 already Wow
