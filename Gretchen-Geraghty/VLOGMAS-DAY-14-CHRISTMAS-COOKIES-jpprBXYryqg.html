Lucy and I are on our way to hot yoga
first we're picking up Danny cuz he's
gonna come with us yoga mats and
everything yeah I'm like short from
trieste righteousness and he did like
stretch out I freaking love hot yoga but
yeah I really can't like filming there I
don't know it might be kind of weird and
then we're making sugar cookies today
I'm so excited and I'm making their
peanut butter ones too can we share our
secret recipe I'll tell you guys our
secret recipe because it's literally the
best peanut butter cookies ever with
like chocolate kisses we've made them
probably a hundred times and I'm not
even like joking like we've literally
made 100 times they're so good I'm gonna
test them and they always make me fat
and I like love them they're like
perfect and they always come out
perfectly so yeah we'll share us the
kids later and first sugar cookies were
not so sure we just looked at her as big
online but those should be good too
Danny's a true yoga fan okay so I just
had a really really good question of the
day today's question of the day is if
you could have any food for the rest of
your life and only that one food what
would it be and why and for me wow I
didn't even think of one mine would
probably just be bread because breads
like really yummy and basic and I
wouldn't kiss sick of it what would be
your food that you would eat if you
could only eat one food for the rest of
your life comment down below oh my gosh
really beer now I was like
see look at professional who's gonna
sure makes you look really skinny - I
actually like it a lot I don't like it
at first it's like high-necked but it's
definitely liked it at first yeah it
looks nice so I'm gonna go shower just
look at my hair
hey cookie
I think my subscribers like when you
sing now is so rude it's a heart
with Lucy in it I'm dying dying alright
I literally can't even yeah so yeah it
was super fun I really like love how
yoga so much just because it makes me
feel like way better and I'm just like
really sore I don't know why I guess I'm
like not used to like urging a lot a lot
but um yeah so oh my god it's like being
crazy so yeah yoga was good and then
oh you saw we had french toast I don't
know why I think I've shown for his
toast like two or three blogs recently
and I showed it every time we make it
just cuz I don't know why I leucine I've
been like really obsessed with french
toast it's like really yummy I don't
know and we started making sugar cookies
cuz you know like sometimes you make
sure because you have to like let the
dough get cold in the fridge so we
started making that and it's gonna like
chill it in the fridge
I think Justin gets home from a soccer
tournament later so I think I might be
able to go see him later today so that's
cute oh it's coming that's weird yeah
Danny okay so like I said earlier the
best peanut butter cookie recipe you
will ever hear I'm about to tell you so
pick put pay close attention it's 1/2 a
cup of butter 1/2 a cup of peanut butter
1/2 a cup of sugar 1 egg 1/2 cup brown
sugar and 1 teaspoon of vanilla and you
like cream all those together alright
and then after that you add in 1 and 1/4
cup of flour 3/4 teaspoons of baking
soda 1/4 teaspoon salt and you add all
that into the like creamy mixture that
you had before because then
be more like dough form after you put in
like all the dry stuff you know because
before is mostly like wetter like sugar
and my ingredients and then after that
it gets kind of hard to mix together you
know like because it gets really doughy
and then you put them into 1-inch balls
and you roll them in sugar and you put
them on a pan and it doesn't need to be
greased and you can bake them 8 to 10
minutes at 350 or 375 just depending if
you like the more like crispy I guess I
think usually we do 350 and yeah you
make them for like usually eight minutes
and they come out perfect and then you
let them cool for like a minute or two
and you put on her she cookies on top
and they're so it's good if you eat the
dough raw too with some Hershey Kisses
look at our dome cookies yippee okay
what have you done
ten-foot childhood melted chocolate
eclair mustache joke you think of them
in chocolate disperses it on what
happened to that one that's the one he
tried to heat it was like folks funny
any song that goes on before I like
all right good angel oh it's so pretty
I'm seriously so happy we ended up
getting like the 12-footer my fav
we slept to put the ornaments on in the
star and everything they actually turned
up good I was kind of suspicious earlier
but now they look good oh I just got
home from Justin's and I said this is
probably a million boxes and videos for
but there's not any problems cuz he
doesn't want to be in the video so
that's why there's nobody from there
but yeah so now I'm just eating some
sugar cookies and I'm going to brush my
teeth

have some work to do really the
vlogmas for tomorrow see I saw a lot to
