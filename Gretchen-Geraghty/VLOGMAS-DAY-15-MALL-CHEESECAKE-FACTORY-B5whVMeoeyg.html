yeah this minute is heading to the mall
now guess right now what's our favorite
restaurant
okay if you said Cheesecake Factory
you're right it's a Cheesecake Factory
hopefully we know the Cheesecake back
here too because that's like a favor
restaurant ever and yeah we're just
gonna do some Christmas shopping and
procrastinate doing our homework cuz
that's what we do basically every night
we're running because we're really cold
okay so many so many bones
I love logging in the moment so much fun
my arm is literally about to break off
like I can't explain to you how heavy
these are I'm sorry I'm complaining but
like literally they're so heavy and
we're hungry we just want to go to the
Cheesecake Factory and get our salad
isn't it right
we're going to our last destination
which is Sephora my arms breaking off
and we can finally get food where are we
the bench was full inside so reason that
we haven't seen them fall we're wearing
sweatshirts from practice like we look
so usually I'll wear a dress to that
she's a factory for wearing sweaters and
in spann that like we literally spending
like sounders and then we got so many
Christmas gifts for like our friends and
fam
it was so much fun like I actually love
Christmas shopping for other people like
if I could just spend all my money on
other people I would because it's just
so much fun buying gifts for people like
I get so excited so yeah I went to like
LL Bean and Whole Foods and which my
secret and CVS I think yeah CBS Sephora
rumor has it below if you're obsessed
with is kind of bread from the
Cheesecake Factory like me it's like the
brown like oat bread I don't know how to
explain but it's sweet and so good you
know see and I like power down but the
loaf h-hour salad just came and it's
literally the best salad ever like we
eat this whole thing
did you see how massive it is and loosen
I eat the whole thing and it's like the
only thing I get i order it every time I
come here it's called the BBQ Southwest
Ranch chicken salad and it's like
massive so beware when you go you have
to share with someone but it's so good
there's like chicken and beans and
avocados and corn and tomatoes and it's
like literally like our pepper make
cheesecake came and we're so excited
we're just gonna split it because it's
like Qurna big but it looks oh yeah
straight up eating there's people you
shop when I eat in my vlogs or I get
pissed off that I eat my mom because I
wouldn't want to see other people here
in fence gross but I just want to say if
you can get the peppermint cheesecake a
cheesecake factory like this holiday
season you feel it it's so good it's
like chocolatey heavenly team we had we
had 500 shopping bags like in the
restaurant with us look how ghetto and
we look so ratchet we're literally
wearing sweatshirts and spandex like I
said before it's so embarrassing my bag
just ripped my bag just straight a
thrift there's so much crap in it
it's so pretty
but gray just dropped all of our goodies
Oh guys by the way um some people are
commenting like is Lucy just your really
close friend here always together Lucy
is my twin sister that's why we're
always together but yeah we're best
friends too and we're twin sisters so it
it just works out where you can be
yelling because she's my best friend and
my twin sister so that's always nice
when that happens you know
I know they said so song they said so
song so sad I was hoping you write is a
click record I started yawning um I
don't even know if I ended it off
today's vlog I guess I don't think I did
and yeah now it's like 2 a.m. so I have
to get up in like three and a half hours
for school and so many people have asked
me that question do you just like not
sleep like how do you keep up with
homework in vlogmas and stuff and the
reality of it is I don't yes when I'm
just really catches up with me and I
don't feel too well but I'm 85 I'm
enjoying stuff I will stick with vlogmas
I like some projects like schoolwork and
stuff that are kind of suffering but I
mean it's ok I can handle it and like
obviously today at Lucy I chose to go at
them all so I could have done homework
instead of that that's also something I
needed to do for Christmas shopping so
whatever like senior year you gotta like
live a little I guess
and yes it's like 2:00 a.m. and I'm like
really tired but whatever I should
probably start editing this vlog news
for tomorrow because if you didn't
notice my vlogmas day 14 went up so late
like really really late the 15 so I'm
really sorry about that like I said I
like to get them up earlier but I had to
finish editing it because I didn't
finish editing at the day before but the
ball was really fun with Lucy and she
always puts eat me and it good mood if I
just hang out there for a while I'll see
you tomorrow in my next vlog this video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
