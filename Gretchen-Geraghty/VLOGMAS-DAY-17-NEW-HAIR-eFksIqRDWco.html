right now vlog miss day is 2 17 is 17 I
know I keep saying that I'm like every
blog please but I actually can't believe
it's 17 like that means it's so close to
Christmas I mean it's literally a week
away but yeah Lucy and I are driving
this Court now we're stuck in a bunch of
traffic awesome and I am driving to have
my license I say there's no fog wait
okay everyone keeps commenting who was
that boy who is that boy so the boy
that's been in like two of my vlogs I
think two maybe three is Danny and he's
Lucy's boyfriend I'm sorry if I like
didn't mention it they've been dating
for like how long has it been now at
nine months they've already been dating
on so you guys know my boyfriend Justin
and Dani and Justin are like friends so
it worked out pretty well because it
depends and my friends someone someone
replied to a comment and it was like
because someone was like who's Danny
someone's like their grandpa like that's
so freaking funny whoever you are look
good so funny and today I'm getting a
special surprise as you can see by the
China I'm gonna get my hair done I
haven't gotten highlights in tomorrow
and it's gotten like so blonde that I
knew I just had to get some little
lights thrown in there so I think I'm
gonna get some blonde in some brown and
we'll see how that turns out I'm really
excited because I just haven't got my
hair done in a while if you can see
that's literally gross but yeah so
that's a little bit later day and then
we just have practice so yeah LP I think
I'm a little bit early on my way to my
hair appointment I'm so excited
I've been needing to take my hair down
literally for so long and I definitely
want some little ice thrown in there to
break up this like bleach blonde like my
whole entire head because usually I just
hadn't highlighted so having some
Brownback in there won't be nice right
for my hair appointment I'm gonna have
to like jet to crew practice I think my
hair will take like 2 or 3 hours like
it's gonna take a while you know just to
do like a full like boil like setup like
highlights and lowlights and then I'm
gonna go straight to pure practice only
staying until 5th period is really nice
at school when I get to leave after
fifth because that it's a really short
day look I just got to leave at 12 look
how awesome is that
but yeah so on my way to my hair
placement I'm super excited so the next
time you see me this should be gone
so guys I'm so excited I absolutely love
it I just got out of my appointment and
I'm sorry I'm so happy
literally ages before my hair was
stressing me out so much because I had
like two inches of like dark brown roots
that were just like hideous and now I'm
rushing to practice so that I'm not late
and I probably shouldn't be walking
while I'm driving but whatever so I got
some like brown put in it and I just
love it because there's like way more
dimension and it's gonna be way
healthier and I had our do like really
dark on the bottom because that's what I
like yeah so basically I'm just like so
excited my I'll show you like more in
depth later but I just wanted to check
back in how did it go run to practice
but this is a no more route thank God
she just did like a full set of
highlights and lowlights and yeah even
if I wanted to
so I just got back from practice and
here I'll talk a little bit more about
my hair
you guys like ask about my hair a lot
and so today I basically just told her I
was like okay my whole head is like
bleach Bond and it's just too much for
me anymore because initially I always
just had gotten blonde highlights but I
just been getting about highlights for
such a long time that like my whole head
turned blonde and I really wanted some
brown to throw back in there's more like
the blonde highlighted look I guess not
like my whole head bleached blonde the
whole underneath part of my hair is like
brown and I just like it like that she
like asked me if I wanted really put
highlights in there but I was like no i
like the underneath brown just cuz i
like like the contrast like I like the
way like looks differently I don't know
I've just always liked the brown
underneath and then I just got like a
full set of like highlights and
lowlights throughout and like I'll try
to show you it's just like I know she
would you like to blondes for one Brown
you know cuz like I I couldn't go too
dark cuz that would be like crazy
different thank God look I like don't
efforts anymore it's like so amazing not
having roots you know and yeah that's
that I don't really know what else you
guys want to know cuz you guys always
ask me like about my hair and like what
I get done like everything like that I
know the dive I use for my blonde is
like pretty blonde like it's like the
purpley white looking one it's like the
really strong one because I'm like very
blonde my blonde is very blonde do you
know what I mean and then the brown one
is like a chocolatey brown one kinda
like my natural color look you can't
really see my natural color anymore but
it's kind of like the brown that's in
there um so yeah that's about that for
my hair and I'm like really happy
because it just needed to get done for
so long it literally hadn't been dyed
and like forever oh my gosh my friend
Taylor got me a bagel and like she's so
sweet I'm gonna eat it down she got me
honey green with cream cheese
Taylor is BAE I've been trying to do my
question of the days each vlogmas at the
beginning of the video and i think i've
been failing miserably because some days
i forget to do them later in the video
and i know this is later in the video
but I'm just gonna say it anyway and my
question today is very fitting if you
could dye your hair any color what color
would it be and why
and it can be a crazy color to it
doesn't have to be like brown black
blond
like whatever it can be like purple or
yellow or something and for me I think
if I hard to do like a crazy color I
would do it like light lilac II purple
cuz like you know like you know what the
the platinum blonde with like lilac II
purple I think that's so pretty it's
just like really like daring you know
but yeah I would definitely do that
color cuz I've seen like girls with that
color hair and it's like so pretty so
yeah if you could dye your hair any
color what would it be and why leave
your comment down below guys look

not my good he's not my cousin he's not
my brother he lose his boyfriend
