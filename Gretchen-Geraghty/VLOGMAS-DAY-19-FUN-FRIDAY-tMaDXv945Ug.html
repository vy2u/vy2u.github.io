doesn't want to be on the camera so yeah
that last clip was just us like driving
home and that was me being really tired
in the car and I don't know how it was I
had so much chatter came it's like 2:00
in the morning and he was like dancing
and singing to his new favorite song
uptown funk so that was that I'm so
tired
it's 2:00 a.m. so okay so what happened
was basically we went to Justin's
basketball game and then afterwards
Hannah and Justin and I went to Panera
because we were hungry in my food then
after that Hannah had to go to like her
ski house so Justin I stopped by his
house so that he could shower and change
and then we came back to my house cuz we
were just gonna like hang out like watch
Christmas movies and then his parents
had like a party with like their friends
and family so they're like how about you
come over so then it was like 10:30 and
Justin and I went back to his house and
like hung out in like at a party and it
was super funny like pee pictionary and
I'm actually really bad at pictionary
but whatever and then they came and
dropped me back off and now it's 2:00
a.m. so I have to get up in like five
hours for practice which is like a
little before 8:00 boom I know very
early so I better like it to bed and I'm
already like getting behind in my
vlogmas but I'll really try to catch up
tomorrow
and I have to work on like a school
project tomorrow and look at what I got
from Justin's family will be the best
thing in the whole world
it's kettle corn and it's so good and
it's literally addicting like if you get
it you'll probably gain like 10 pounds
so like don't eat if you're trying to
lose weight cuz like you will eat the
whole thing it's so addicting it's so
good
but like look how peaceful it is like
late at night the Christmas tree I
walked in and I was like oh okay I just
want to like sing some Christmas carols
you know like take a little nap in here
I don't know it's pretty but I should
probably like head to bed seeing as it's
like literally past two I am now I'm
like really tired but yeah it's night
was really fun and today was really
really really a long day because I got
up at like 5:00 I'm very tired and hey
look I'm surprised my curls have lasted
all day usually they're bright they're
pretty good with that though like they
stay like all day I noticed and just
like Teen Vogue's but I tried to get him
a little bit so he might be like
scattered about like a tiny bit I think
I sound very like monotone right now
