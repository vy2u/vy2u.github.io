school again just like yesterday I just
got home in memory said I got that
jacket from Patagonia yesterday and I
got this vest too like it's gonna be in
there for the week - and I'm waiting for
my tea
yummy yummy I'm probably just gonna go
upstairs and work on some homework and
upload vlogmas day one so like say it's
vlogmas day one that's gonna go up on
December 2nd like vlogmas days you will
go from December 3rd so I have a nice
like edited and uploaded so it was
always gonna be like a day behind like
that and today I'm actually lifeguarding
down at the YMCA I'm gonna be like
lifeguarding a shift and then afterwards
I'll work out I filmed a little bit of
school today I think I filmed Hannah
she's like really funny I'm gonna see if
this is a regular potato chip orbit salt
and vinegar it looks like some vinegar
I mean crap oh and remember how I just
said how I was really busy with like
homework and stuff I literally stayed up
till 3:30 last night like I don't even
know how I'm functioning right now like
I was going nuts I think I tried to film
some vlog myself like 3:30 in the
morning I like was probably saying
nonsense so if that's any good footage
elegans are you here so it's actually
like really really early December 2nd so
I probably can't talk right my face is
all crazy for my moisturizer and I'm
wearing retainers I just thought I would
vlog now because this is the real life
of jail beeps oh yeah I'm awake I missed
8:30 and I have to get up in two hours
and this is why I'm dead tomorrow should
be rough he makes me happy my gosh also
- I guess I'll mention today when I was
at school I went to the bathroom in like
the younger hallways and this girl that
came out to me it was like oh my gosh
like I really love your videos like you
do such a nice job and that literally
made my day like when people say they
like appreciate my videos like whether
it's subscribers that don't go to my
school or do go to my school cuz I guess
I didn't realize - like I guess a lot of
that watch my videos do you go to my
school which is like crazy to think
about cuz I don't really know like a lot
of the younger kids since I'm a senior
but yeah if you're like a freshman or
like your sophomore even at my school
probably don't know you but if you like
watch my videos you can totally like
talk to me like I like oh my gosh like
it makes me so happy so yeah that really
brighten my day cuz I love when people
say they like my videos and I especially
when people go to my school like that's
so special and yeah I just like love you
guys so much
okay kids talk I was so early but yeah
now I'm just going to work so yeah it's
pretty relaxed night so it's really
awkward because I'm at fishing with a
million people and I'm really hot and
sweaty so I'm like I'm in the ground
somebody can tell I'm talking to myself
but I just heard I'm like five miles and
now I'm just a statue Duke or because I
usually like doing cardio and then just
stretching and doing court all right
so I just got back from the Y from
lifeguarding and working out and now I'm
gonna go eat dinner even though it's
like 8:45 I just had to know now I'm
gonna have my favorite snack ever which
is bananas and peanut butter and I
pretty much talked about it like a
million times on my channel but I never
even said what inspired me to eat
bananas and peanut butter which is
Justin's mom because she was eating a
banana with peanut butter one time and
it was so good and ever since then I've
seriously been obsessed so if it wasn't
for Justin's mom I don't know what I
would have done because I'm like
obsessed with it first you dip your
spoon peanut butter
like that then you cut a piece of banana
with it and it's like that so yeah I ate
and showered and I'm like finishing up
my homework I'm like really tired
somehow I still like Brendan worked out
but yeah that's like everything I did
today I hope you go into interesting
I'll see you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
