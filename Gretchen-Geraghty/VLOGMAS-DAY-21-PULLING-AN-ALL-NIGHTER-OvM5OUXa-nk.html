notice every Miss Asia I wore last night
when I was going to sleep so you know
what that means
oh my drawers are open I'm sorry that
really bothers me um basically that
means that I've been a lazy bum all day
long and I've just been like importing
footage and like I see right there I've
just been like importing footage and
like editing videos all day long in my
pajamas
so that's why I'm like not wearing
really human clothes I'm still wearing
pajamas um yeah so I've literally just
spent like anything all day and I'd
better like start my homework you know
like everyone needs like an off day to
just kind of like collect themselves do
some homework edit like eight videos
they have to do you feel but I'm getting
like really excited and I like am in the
Christmas spirit now because Christmas
is literally like three days away I'm so
excited
and can you guys let me know today's
question of the day can be do you like
Christmasy better or Christmas day
better because for me I love Christmas
Eve so much better like just the
anticipation of like Christmas is better
than Christmas itself which is kind of
sad almost but I always get like so
excited and my Christmas Eve is just so
much fun like you're like baking cookies
in like eating like we always have our
big dinner on Christmas Eve even like
getting all excited and everything my
Christmas days you just kind of like
chill out and play with all your new
toys like I don't know
Christmas Eve to me is just better um
yeah so I've literally been sitting here
all day just like editing videos and I
have to like edit my government project
it's to tomorrow
it's gonna be a video it's gonna be
super exciting that so I've been filming
with like Charlie and Justin and that's
what you seen them in my other vlogs
because this is very soon I'm very
excited and Christmas Eve I believe
we're just gonna like eat dinner with
our family here I think Christmas day
actually think I'm gonna go to Justin's
and like hang out with his family and I
love them to bed so that's gonna be
super fun yeah I guess I like check-in
if anything changes maybe if I like eat
some food or do something fun probably
won't probably just to homework all day
oh and it's literally it's 3:52
so this is honestly haven't moved from
this spot all day
I'll sound like I'm editing my last two
blog misses and I'm noticing my hair has
been curled in those two videos in here
and you're probably wondering touching
your hair is curly and like all these
videos and I'll just tell you I'm Way
too lazy to cut my hair everyday it's
clearly because I haven't washed my hair
in like two days but I get my self
justification in that it just got done
it just got dyed so usually we're
definitely get it dyed I'll try to like
give it a few days um before I wash it
but this time I actually washed it like
the day after I got it died and then I
waited like now I'm waiting like two or
three days and I'll shower in like an
hour too so don't worry but I mean it
doesn't look like that crazy or anything
and yeah so I just thought I would just
address the fact that my hair has been
curled and like all my videos and you're
probably like Gretchen are you like not
showering and no I have been showering I
just haven't been washing my hair so
that it can be like healthy and yeah but
I actually like the way it looks like
second-date curls cuz it's kind of like
wavy you know we're not like super super
tight like I'll show you see like right
there in this vlog mess I don't know if
you can tell it's kind of like tighter
curls yeah so I kind of like you wanting
to see like this but yeah guys will see
just through and she didn't I was like I
wish I've never done anything like that
my only where you tried again sorry I
have to go home editing a video no
pressure
take it easy I can't look at this I'm
looking at this don't look at that
well that's a family only do it I've
never even doing it in my own mouth it
was so casual to taste the rainbow
I got $80 worth of chocolate I spent
like my life savings on poor but I mean
now I just took a shower first shower in
like three days
cute so everyone well it's actually
technically December 22nd so this should
be vlogging to say 22nd but day 22nd yep
okay so I'll let me just start off by
saying it is for 28 a.m. and some of you
probably want to punch me I know I
should not be up this late I have to get
up in there for school so I just decided
that I'm not going any better I'm just
gonna stay up because what's the point
in trying to sleep for an hour when I
can be productive am i right so I'm
trying to export a video upload it it's
actually not for you guys it's for my
government class and it's like a 20
minute long video so it's gonna take two
more hours and I'm really stressed that
I'm not gonna be able to upload it even
before I leave for school because two
more hours from 4:30 if you do the math
is 6:30 and we leave for school a little
bit after 6:30 so
cross your fingers like pray with me
here hopefully this works out and
because we have to like watch it first
period um but yeah I don't even know how
I'm like functioning right now and I
don't know what in the heck I'm gonna do
for tomorrow feel like practice and
everything because I'm literally gonna
be like so tired and yeah literally like
you've seen today's vlog nice I've been
such a bum I've just spent editing all
day but clearly I needed to because I'm
about 4:30 in the morning so there's
that I have a lot of pimples on my
forehead don't look at them but I'll
just find myself staying up all night in
the fact that when I've two days at
school then it's Christmas so I can like
rest then right I hope maybe um but yeah
it is 4:30 a.m. and I do have to go to
school in like an hour and a half two
hours uh and I like didn't even do that
much more for my other classes like I
still have like work to do it's just
it's like a rough life you know there's
a lot to do a lot of people to see
places to be and not enough hours in the
day alright so that's what happened it's
4:30 that's just how it goes sometimes
did you ever figure the only one awake
in the whole entire world literally I'm
the only one awake right now
only one yeah so I'm gonna end up like
mr. 21 right here thank you so much for
watching you know I think I'm gonna
start filming tomorrow's vlog bits right
now because it actually is the 22nd</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
