4:31 a.m. the 22nd and I just didn't go
to sleep 21st and I was the 22nd cuz I
had a lot to do and you go to school I'm
like two hours but that's alright I got
stuff to do so I gotta stay up and yeah
so today's vlog this might be boring
because it might consist of me like
passing out at school it's a long day at
school - I have to stay 12 to 15 oh and
yeah I like edited all of yesterday did
some Christmas wrapping yeah so wish me
luck today with like zero hours of sleep
okay it's 547 and isolated go to bed and
I would get up in ten minutes for school
so I'm just gonna start getting ready I
turn off the lights so I could relax but
I'm still working in my video and it's
this I did it it's gonna be a rough day
basically is what I'm saying I literally
can't believe I pulled an all-nighter it
just feels really weird the wall usually
hit to right around 3:30 3045 I was like
but I climbed right over that wall and
now it just feels honestly weird I never
like to sleep look it feels like night
time went by so quickly you know because
I feel like sleeping for like eight
hours well actually you should probably
like six or five hours sleeping for like
six hours seems like a long time but I
just stayed up all that time and it went
by really quick there seriously is not
enough hours in the day basically what
I'm saying oh and you'll be happy to
know I picked out my black sweatshirt
leggings ugg boots and a vest first day
because I just know I'm gonna be cold
and tired and exhausted and miserable
something really comfy clothes and I'm
probably gonna be like really lazy all
day I don't know I felt like that's a
head injury now like the really really
tiredness hasn't hit me yet so probably
later in vlogmas will be like
but for now I'll try to keep my spirits
high this was expected of course I'm
gonna sound like this all day so tell me
how this works
I stay up all night how ironic I'm
literally gonna be late to school
because I'm waiting for Lucy
so up all night and I'm still gonna be
late for school
Christmas happy Monday happy hour
Taylor okay okay oh my government video
didn't go over so well since it was on a
controversial topic and everyone hated
it even though I spent like lots of time
on it
sad face and so yeah I don't like people
that hurt me what I said to Hannah is
like you don't have to agree with me but
you suck to be respectful and people
were like people were laughing they're
talking so I'm leaving school now and
today he's been kind of sad just cuz
like why not like the worst feeling ever
is that I have experience today why not
you realize people that you thought
liked you actually don't like you
because you hear that they've been take
not really nice things about you and
it's really sad and I don't mean to get
depressing usually vlog pieces are
really happy and fun but I don't know
today was just sad I heard it from like
probably like three different people I
heard like I actually don't really like
me too much and I thought that we were
like friends and stuff I don't know and
if you watch the vlogs yesterday and
like this morning you'll know that I
didn't sleep so I honestly don't know if
I'll be making it to practice because I
literally like I can barely keep my eyes
open so I might have to just go home and
take like a ten hour nap so it's
probably what I'll be doing and yeah
sorry you get all deep but like I don't
know I just kind of like had an epiphany
that I guess you just gotta try to stay
positive like just by everyone else cuz
I always try to just like make everyone
like me look everyone wants to be like
you know and it's it's hard hearing that
people that you thought liked you like
genuinely liked you really don't and
it's hard when people are kind of like
mean to your face or you you can hear
and people are saying weird things about
you like some people aren't considerate
and it's upsetting but yeah I sorry I
don't mean to get deep I just today was
a rough day it's probably partly because
I'm so tired so I'm probably extra
emotional but I don't know I just heard
like certain people like really don't
like me that I thought did and aren't
saying to nice things and
upsetting but I guess that life is and
you gotta move on so yeah I'm just
waiting for Lucy and we're gonna go home
and I will probably just take a nap like
I said a million times oh and like okay
so specifically with my government
project which is why I was up all
through the night cuz I was editing it
and uploading it so we could watch it in
class tonight I worked really really
really really really really hard on that
government project and it was like
opinion based and like a lot of the kids
in my class I guess have like differing
opinions from me and like um Charlie and
Justin Lucy in my group so like we
worked so hard on that and really put a
lot of effort into it and it was like
really upsetting when you're playing it
in class and I would just looking around
and kids like snickering and like giving
each other if they're like oh my god
like can you believe what we're watching
like look you know and like I like ask
to kid after like what did you think of
it and he's like I thought it was awful
like that was a piece of crap he said I
mean or worry but whatever and you know
like that's so hard to hear and like I
just can't believe people would say that
after you've worked so hard on something
and I think that like you could have
different opinions and people that's
fine but you don't have to agree with me
but you should still like respect me and
respect my opinions and be like
considerate and like I like in the
during the video when I would come up
speaking something like I would
pronounce something right a kid would
you start burst out laughing like that's
not nice like oh my god I just didn't
think it would affect me so much and it
literally was like so upsetting I really
wanted to be like guys like be nice like
I hurt so freaking hard on this like I
didn't sleep and none of you appreciate
it or like and more so you're making fun
of the fact that like kids are just mean
so sorry this has been a rambling long
not too happy vlog miss a little segment
but I just had to get it out there I
guess my point is is just like be nice
because you never know how what you're
saying really affects people and you
don't really know like what like
probably those kids didn't know that I
was up for like literally 14 hours like
editing that like they had no idea so I
mean I guess you really never know
people's like story your background and
just try to be nice because that's just
a good way to live I would say but yeah
I'm gonna drive home now
ah bees making me food oh so much become
and she's a whatever and dry you never
say what it is
nope we got the perfect nine little
banana slices going on looking good
one two three go mm-hmm exactly because
one I'm striving and haven't like eaten
anything today
and two sometimes the choice will it get
cold before I can eat it and it's good
because the toast is still warm and then
the pain but it gets melty and then it's
like super yummy and I seriously and I
was like breakfast or whatever but as
I've said a million times it's like an
all-day everyday type of snack like
breakfast lunch dinner snack dessert oh
yeah and guys it just like hit me like
for me this past month especially like
crew working out and YouTube and
homework has been like my priority but I
haven't really been focusing on like
myself and like health and like sleeping
too much so I really should be like
making that a priority because it's
trying to like take a toll and I'm
getting kind of sick and like not myself
because I'm just so like mentally and
physically drained
so yeah this nap is going to be very
helpful and I just gotta like focus on
getting enough sleep like I gotta like
plan time for sleeping enough and just
like make time for it
because it's like not good for me you
don't I mean so yeah
mmm guys so I took my nap at 2:30 and I
just got up and it's 9:40 and I'm like
so out of it like I don't know if I
should like do my homework I like go
back to sleep but I do have homework to
do still and tomorrow is the day before
Christmas Eve I still have to like
ketchup on vlogmas because I'm getting
behind and it's really rough and like I
said earlier I just gotta like make my
health a priority cuz I haven't been
sleeping so yeah as you can tell I
didn't go to ku practice today I just
slept right through it and now I guess
I'm gonna have to start some homework
but Napa has made me so and productive
I've been lying here for the past hour
like on my phone and Lucy just brought
me chips and salsa cuz I'm so hungry now
these are the really yummy Mike Santino
chips I think they're go and that's like
Tostitos salsa my home works out but I'm
just gonna hang out and eat some chips
for a while I didn't why the fact that I
have stuff to do haha yeah seven hour
nap really gonna screwed me up because
now it's like 11:10 and I just feel like
it's like morning I don't know what I
feel like but what doesn't feel like
11:00 and it feels weird like I should
be still asleep or something and I'm
kind of tired and just want to go back
to bed a bit like I it's tough to do so
I don't know that nap just really kind
of messed up my internal clock I guess I
should go to bed because I'm gonna have
to get up in like five hours for school
this is this whole sleeping thing is
really confusing but you know what it's
break in one day we have one day of
school and then it's break so I'll be
able to sleep in as much as I want so
it's fine um yes right today's blog miss
was like weird because like it was like
me staying up all night so it was
probably like emotional and like grumpy
maybe that's why I was being very weird
after school and saying all those things
but yeah I mean I but I still stayed
true with what I was saying and that I
think everyone should just really try to
like be nice to each other and really
understanding cuz you never know what's
going on with other people and I just
really got me thinking like being nice
to everyone you know I don't know if
that makes sense but yeah Lucy got me
some chips so I didn't starve to death
that's always good yeah as long as it's
just me going like this
bla bla bla bla bla so I hope you
enjoyed it's almost Christmas be happy
everyone I'm super excited
these next vlog missus will be like
Christmas even everything so yeah in
tomorrow I get to wear like my cool
Christmas sweater so I'm excited for
that
yeah I went ad off to bed thank you so
much for watching and I'll see you in
tomorrow's vlog Misbah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
