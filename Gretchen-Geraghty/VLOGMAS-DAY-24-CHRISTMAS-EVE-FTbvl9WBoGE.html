they prefer skin like me yeah they do
they were in yesterday's vlog miss my
math class friends and yeah what kind of
milk do you guys like what kind of milk

skim is the way to go so yeah we
honestly like almond milk how it best
way to go there Christmas - my stuff I'm
gonna clean my car and it's ours a
little a little messy
and I'll write your name I'm reading the
comments of my last vlog miss and
someone said it really bothers me how
when you talk you look like have your
face out of the frame so it's
distracting her to watch have your face
talking someone else was a guest
agreeing and I wonder second beginning
of luck miss I remember I'd always be
like this but it's only because like my
hand gets like tired and it just trying
to go slower lower and lower down you
know I don't know um but I don't I don't
usually I don't mean to but like my last
to walk misses I like purposely was
going like this because I had a bunch of
and both starting like right here and I
didn't want you to see them when I
wasn't wearing makeup so I would go like
this you could only see like my eyeballs
down so yeah that's really why I was
trying to cut off by the pimples I can
smell cookies cooking downstairs so
