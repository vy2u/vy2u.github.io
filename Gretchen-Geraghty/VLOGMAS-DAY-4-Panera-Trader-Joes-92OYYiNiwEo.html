December 4th and I actually slept in
today I'm really bad I like was so tired
and was just not feeling well last night
and this morning I could not get up at
like 5:45 5:30 so I slept till like now
it's like 9:30 and I gotta get to school
cuz I can't miss my lab class but yeah
so I just slept a little bit today I
feel so bad I like missed a bunch of
classes and then tomorrow I go off to
Wisconsin like I mentioned in
yesterday's vlog miss and I'm going to
try to upload as much as possible but I
don't know how that's gonna work out I
don't know what the Wi-Fi situation or
how much I'm even gonna build a film
while I'm there if this weekend's kind
of like weird with vlogmas that's why
you'll know why I like tweet about it
I'll be in Wisconsin so now I'm just off
to school but I hate that sticker I said
come back turn around and smile you're
gonna be in the next vlog Mase look at
her I'm this beautiful this whew I might
man I would tap the holiday spirit out
of him all right guys guys guys guys
guys guys just yeah where are we going
what you get here huh
can I have a Caesar salad and our
chicken and oh sweet and I need as per
usual and a yummy chocolate chocolate
mousse II got her Caesar salad with a
baguette and chocolate chip cookie and
that's really weird because I got a
seizure chicken salad David do it if I
get out of a radio jockey radio wish she
got one Lucy what is that unsweetened
this tropical hibiscus tea so bed
these cookies your life deep in my
Corazon
now we chose my homeland are we doing
really giving
Lucy what did you just find cookie
butter ice cream it's really really
obsessed with everything cookie butter
right are we gonna get yep we're getting
it put it in put it in salt stuff it in
there yep I'm good we can be nice today
yeah that's yes so listen I just went to
Trader Joe's whoo and we got a whole
bunch of stuff so sadly we couldn't get
like fresh like produce and stuff
because we mainly got like snacks for
our plane trip and we also couldn't get
food that would like go bad because
we're gonna be gone for like three days
so we didn't want to get like um good
fruits or vegetables anyway because they
would be bad by the time we got back so
yeah we just got some stuff that like
either wouldn't go bad and like yeah
processed food basically and food that
we could bring on the plane so if you're
wondering why it's not like good healthy
food that's why hi so we just got him
and I'm really happy cuz this scarf was
waiting for me and it's really soft and
fuzzy and I'll show it probably in a
haul video but it's like a plaid
infinity scarf and it's so soft and it
kind of looks like those like Burberry
ones you know but like it's obviously
not that expensive and yeah it's like
really soft and cozy though okay so this
is what we got from Trader Joe's and I
know it does not look very healthy at
all usually loose you know I will like
more fruits and vegetables and
everything which like we still are but
we just tried to get some basic leg
snacks and stuff to bring to Wisconsin
like on the plane and some other stuff
that like wouldn't go bad for when we
got back so that's why we didn't get
like fruits or vegetables and let me
already have some here anyway so we got
some more like unhealthy things but
they're like still like yummy so we got
these um blueberry cereal like granola
bars which I really like and I've gotten
those before and I've never had these
but was he said she really likes them
they're like chocolate coconut water so
we're gonna try those and then these
we've gotten before - they're like mini
peanut butter sandwich crackers and
they're really yummy and then these will
bring out a plane definitely I love
honey roasted peanuts and we also love
trail mix so we're
bring those and then these are for my
friend Hannah her mom had them before
and they are really good they're like
dark chocolate covered power berries so
I don't know I think it's like
pomegranate seeds maybe and some like
other things like acai really now and
then these really aren't good at all and
I just got them so we can eat them
tonight cuz it looks really I mean to me
they're like dark chocolate peanut
butter cupcakes and then these we will
like totally around the plane they're
called inner peas and I think they have
these at like other grocery stores too
from like other brands but just kind of
like dry crunchy like snap peas and
they're like have like barely any
calories but they taste really I mean
it's a really fun snack this isn't
really healthy at all but they just
looked really yummy in me love cookie
butter so we decided to try the cookie
butter ice cream cuz we didn't even know
that they had those and also we found
these dark chocolate cookie butter cups
so they always look really tasty too and
then we just got some fibre whole green
wheat bread because we like ran out of
bread and had to get some oh so it is
holy oh my gosh I cannot believe how
late it is gotten guys is now 12:44 and
I am leaving this house at five in the
morning to catch my plane to Wisconsin
so it's going to be an early morning in
a long day in please don't look at my
face I started to break out again like I
said I would I knew I would I could feel
like the last thing I showed you was the
food I got from Trader Joe's ever since
I got home I've just been like editing
kind of getting my stuff together for
Wisconsin and then Justin came over for
awhile and I just want to like throw
this in here really quick I know pretty
much like half the comments I get are
about putting up videos with Justin you
guys are like oh we love Justin like
show more of Justin and stuff but like I
want you guys to realize that making
videos and having a YouTube channel like
for me it's such like an easy thing like
I've always just loved making videos and
I obviously don't mind being on camera
at the in pictures like whatever and
some people are like that some people
don't care really about being on camera
and like pictures and stuff but some
people don't really like it that much
and some people like aren't too crazy
about like being in videos and like
taking pictures and Justin's just one of
those people like we're still together
he loves me I love him but he just kind
of doesn't really like being in pictures
and doesn't really
videos so I really try to respect that
and sometimes I like why I'm to be in
videos and stuff but I really just have
to like listen to what he says I'm gonna
listen what he wants to do I'm not gonna
like make him do something he's not
comfortable doing so if he doesn't want
to be in a video for awhile that's okay
and that's that so sorry guys like I
don't know that's just the way he is but
he's he's been in like pictures with me
and stuff and we're still together doing
good but he just doesn't like to be
filmed that much so yeah that's that and
I'm just going to conclude today's vlog
I'll probably just edit some more videos
on the plane cause I saw some Bahamas
ones I want to put up and then maybe so
much out of the weeks but yeah I'll see
you in my next vlog good night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
