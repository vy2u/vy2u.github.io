but this is just gonna go the beginning
of the video because it's the most
important and I just talked to Taylor
and today's a question of the day is if
you were to be a fly on the wall where a
juvie and why which I think it's a
really cool question because it's like
who would you kind of like spy on I
guess and if I were to be a fly in the
wall this is like I said this is pretty
typical but I would be a fine wall at
the White House because you could see
everything that's going on with like the
president and because Lucy and I are
obsessed with scandal right now and like
it's all about the White House and
there's like so much drama that goes on
so I think it's like real life which
even that's probably not but yeah I
would be applying the wall at the White
House to see all the drama that goes on
and probably none probably just like
politics but whatever suffocating my
neck we have some noobs and their cheese
hats right Madison Airport and we don't
want to leave it's actually so pretty
but mom all about that peace so cute
securities and today we're just
traveling home Tyrion's bigger than this

some time to kill before next play that
play was so quick it was like 2002 my
first house can actually be good

strawberry banana apple I didn't know
how it would be with the Apple but it
was actually so yummy but I just had to
look at oh please there's like a little
