announcement video so that you guys can
get some prom dresses if you are
interested I know it's about to be prom
season and I just have poor prom dresses
that I'm selling because sadly I'm in
college and don't have use for them
anymore
so one of them is my senior prom dress
one of them is Lucy senior prom dress
and then two of them are my friend
Hannah's that I said I would sell for
her because they're so cute and yeah
we're sad that way you don't have
problem to go to anymore because we
really want to wear them but anyways
this first one for sale is my prom dress
from my senior year it's just this prom
dress that I got at a local boutique
it's silver and all beaded and like
crystal e on the top it's so so pretty
if it's literally breaking my heart that
I can't wear it again and then it's just
really flowy on the bottom in this aqua
mint blue-green color so I'm five nine
and it fit me perfectly with flats so
Hannah is five six it is wearing three
and chills with it just for reference so
you know and in dress sizes are in
between like a 2 and a 4 I got a 4
tailored to fit me perfectly all of
these dresses are being sold on eBay
I'll have them linked it down below this
one is Lucy senior prom dress it's just
as black really pretty prom dress it's
all beaded on this side and this one was
really really expensive by the way I
remember she bought it for like $700
it's just a really nice brand you can
check that out I'll have it linked down
below the back is all open and the sides
are so pretty just all the beading and
how it dips really low and it goes like
higher in the front it's just black and
really sleek and simple I just think
it's so beautiful and Lucy looks so
pretty in it also it's a size zero
because Lucy is so skinny and she didn't
have to get it tailored at all she is
just a zero and a dress size because she
is a little itty bitty and Lucy is 5/8
and she wore these with flats just for
some reference in case you were
wondering now this is Hannah's senior
prom dress it's seriously so beautiful
it's Sherri Hill which Sherri Hill has
like the prettiest dresses ever it's
just this red beautiful dress she
literally went hunting for it because it
was like limited edition and it just has
this lace detail on it and like beading
and it's like kind of like mermaid fit
is that what it's called it's like
tight-fitting and it just has like beads
and lace on the side and it has like a
beautiful beaded like collar at the top
the fit of it is so flattering and just
so pretty Hannah look so beautiful in it
and again she's ring like 3-inch heels
with it and that's what she wore with it
so it's like also tailored for like a
five-nine five-ten and this is actually
Hannah's junior prom dress is beautiful
it's just like emerald green color and
it just has this beading all across the
top this one is a size two and it might
have got tailored down a little bit like
a little bit smaller I'll have all the
measurements and stuff for these listed
on the eBay listing the brand is love
them I know a bunch of you have problems
that you'll be going to this season so
you should definitely check these out
I'm going to start them all I don't
really low price so that they're
affordable for you guys but I am selling
them because my parents wanted Lucy RI
too and Hannah as well because promises
are expensive as you guys know so
selling them back is a great way for you
guys to get your hands on some dresses
but also that they're not just like
sitting in our closets and all of these
dresses are in really good condition
because they were only warm one night
and if you were interested in them like
I said you can just check them out I
will have the links to them listed down
below and yeah thank you guys so much
