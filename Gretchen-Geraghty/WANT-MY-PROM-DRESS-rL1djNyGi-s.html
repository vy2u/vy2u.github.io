obvious I've obviously pretty sick right
now so that's why I don't have a voice
but I still wanted to build it is a
voiceover for you guys so as you can see
i am selling my prom dress as well as
Lucy's on ebay so i just thought i would
share this with you guys because i only
work once last year to junior prom and
i'm absolutely obsessed with my dress
it's by the brand flush and it's just
like the prettiest pinkish purple color
and there's all these beads at the top
and I love it and it was up to me I
would wear to get into senior ball so
anyways I am selling on ebay and Lucy is
also selling hers so that will be linked
down below so I just wanted to let you
guys know because I literally love it so
much and I hope one of you guys love it
just as much as I do so both of our
dresses are strapless and they both have
like beating on them Lucy's has some
cutouts on it I love her is it
absolutely beautiful it's like a whitish
ivory color and both of our dresses fit
kind of the same way their like tight at
the top and they blow out and I just
included some prom pictures here and
there as well if you've noticed it just
has some like gold and silver beading
and I'm sorry must be so hard to hear me
right now and it has a cutout in the
back like I said Lucy's in my dresses
are both tailored to a size between like
two and four but it really depends
unlike the measurements cuz all sizes
are different so that measurements will
be listed on ebay so you can see that
and yeah both of our dresses started off
as like a four and but then they were
tailored down to like a two um just
because they needed to be able take it
in can shorten a little bit so yeah I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
and I hope one of you like these dresses
as much as we do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
