I remember a specific vlog I'm like a
year ago maybe and we went to the same
supermarket or about to go to right now

creams to eat them even though I was
like late at night yeah we're just gonna
go do that right now and I was like want
to bring you guys along so this might
just be like a quick little vlog but I'm
just really happy to be home

like love being home and I'm so fun we
just went out to dinner with our parents
and I just missed them they're like our
best friends like will see me a really
close with our parents and I know it's
hard on them when we both left at the
same time I always feel bad for leaving
huh so we're just gonna go good surfer

this isn't our car by the way
so guys Lucy's been trying to not have
it's like dairy or eggs it just really
doesn't eat meat anymore
yeah hurts her stomach in Chesnee me
seems like october so she's like pretty
much vegetarian and like maybe vegan
some day so we're looking for Ben and
Jerry's would you say maybe half wow
they've totally covered strawberries
wait this is like an omen Dutch in May
I'm telling you ever find out that's
your favorite why do you how do you eat
pineapple that you like to be really
close but I like chocolate-covered
pineapple but I don't like pineapple
when it's in every no no I don't we kind
of wanted to cook in things I just like
it fresh and cold when it's cut up you
feel so basically what I was saying
Lucy is trying not to eat dairy and she
like doesn't eat meat anymore so she's
hoping that they have the new almond
milk flavors with any cherries I don't
agree yeah they like it just came out
like a day ago so I don't think they're
gonna have on she hopes that they do
again either I'm screaming literally
screaming no okay okay
I just tell you a quick story real quick
I'm just gonna put these down for a sec
while I tell you my story when I was in
Aruba with Justin in his family me and
Alison and Jacqueline his mom and his
sister went to haagen-dazs to begin it
twice yeah we did get it twice because
they have a haagen-dazs
store there and we don't have one here I
don't know if you guys have one where
you live but
Jacqueline was telling me about this ice
cream sundae which is dulce de leche ice
cream with caramel and whipped cream and
bananas it was seriously the best thing
I ever ate and so I've been looking for
the dulce de leche haagen-dazs ice cream
to like recreate it and I just found it
and I can't believe it and it's gonna be
so good I'm gonna make it for Lucy where
is she going
but yeah so I can't believe it I'm gonna
get one or two of them and I go oh it's
kind of expensive it's like five dollars
of high and Lucy goes I am Oscar thank
God it was really funny oh my god I
think it's going to sell me well I'm
kind of embarrassed but this is the real
gob basically okay bye people are
looking what's that
Lucy was telling you the other day how
they have like these limited edition
flavors well everyone knows it it's just
common home
so she's really excited it isn't a cake
batter with raspberry swirls that sounds
amazing
oh my god me too I know my hamstrings
are really tight Oh Lucy's making vegan
chocolate cake because she's gonna begin
soon
we have mom's credit card so this
shopping trip has gotten a little out of
hand since we realized we had everyone's
credit card and can do lots of shopping
and no meeting some raspberries
programming shoga who else eats while
they're in the grocery talking up a
little basket now we have the full cart
and we haven't even north ice cream yet
boo pistachios I that's my dog I'm
really like oh yeah they're really like
a tag you look like a fork and like the
chocolate frosting tasted better so it
was just like a bad yeah will you see
black and white cookies all the time and
one summer on our lake house we only ate
the chocolate side because it tasted way
better than the vanilla side so there
was just vanilla chunks in this
container
we're actually guys no way fun fact
Brussels sprouts are my favorite food in
the whole world and me and Taylor got
this bag the other day and made a mat
for you for dinner they were so good
Taylor we're giving you a present inside
joke I hope you see this in laughs we
saw them in thought of you love you okay
that woman is laughing at us so bad
she's like you guys don't have a life
it's like literally 10:50 11:00 o'clock

gonna blame it on you because they like
know my business teacher puts it this
way she goes I'm a great consumer I
think it's so funny and she says
I've never heard this song but I really
like it it's cool mom we're back now
there's Lucy in the background and
basically it was really fun going to the
grocery and we're really happy we got a
bunch of ice cream and I'm about to eat
this little one I remember growing up
when I was like chubby I always loved
chocolate fudge brownie I haven't had it
in a while so it's probably really good
so we're about to just eat some ice
cream and maybe watch some netbooks or
something and go to bed because I'm
really tired and I'll probably sleep for
like 12 hours because that's always
happens I'm really tired
oh look this is my new shirt if you just
saw my haul video it was in there I just
got in Vineyard Vines
