huh YUM this is really what we needed
Maggie and I are at Zara we're trying on
a a bunch of clothes we found this cute
dressing room this is so a Maggie spied
now like how cute is this but I love
that right here get a smaller one but
that I thought you'd be too tight on my
body but I feel like those type of
dresses are flatter like ripped like I
like stretch out anyway
you know this knows boys yesterday
you're so so I'm this it's like a little
kid it just took me eight years to
button all this up to
I know how I feel okay guys I can't
really show you because Maggie's naked
but these jeans are really cool and
Maggie you can see your foot Maggie got
these yesterday and I really like them
so I'm gonna get them too
so guys Maggie's out there taking
pictures right now and the dress that
she's trying on which by the way is like
this plate babydoll dress and I'm like
I'm literally coffee
anyone could soak you and I knew when I
tried it on I'm gonna be obsessed but
anyway she had this little take her like
I was just hungry
no it was cute I was just gonna say
Maggie try this on it was so cute but we
thought it was a dress but look how
short it is look it's literally like a
short too now so you can try this on
tonight remember this would be cute as a
tunic that was like white shorts oh no
it's so fun but I would only wear it
like here okay also we I'm so gonna try
that on also I wanted to address really
quick I feel I look very dark in these
clips and I didn't tell you guys the
last night I use self-tanner
and I'm me and Maggie you're such a
loving tan gals like we always use dark
but I want to try extra dark because for
ultra dark right that's what I'm I uses
but then I just got Bondi sands to Trejo
and when I first was putting it on I was
in oh my gosh I'm not even tan but it's
developed overnight and I just look like
so good in bronze and I just feel so
much better that I had some color on me
like I was just very detailed before
because my loving tan like wore off and
yeah I would say that I love this bright
one I just spray it on the mitt and rub
it all over me and it just turned out so
good I think it's a little bit lighter
clubbing gym but it looks more like
naturally
and I also got the moose so I gotta try
that as well yeah I'll do right now is
saris Hugh okay so are you gonna get her
down as mom yeah and wait there okay
wait I'm back
I haven't taken this off yet and I can't
decide it's like really fine but like
what I wear more than one I don't know
it's so like distinct but also just for
here like it's so cute there's a million
of me hit the little things and let go
but this is so
and it could be cute like a baby to
cover up or like with like white shorts
or something just lines here
and I have like my new up around sandals
I got from Express I did a car my vibe I
love them they're just like flat and
have a plan for now like over them I've
been wearing them every day except for
today mark my idea feature sides but
those broad express one's Belding down
below because I just feel like I love
them so much and I just know they would
look so cute with this I'm really good
with everything but with this little
majiggy it would be really cute so I
might have to get this I'm gonna consult
with stylist Maggie easy as you think
and then I'm like Maggie you like if you
need to be a stylist / writer / just
help you because she's so good a thing
out together and I'm really not used my
blog camera I just sorta vlogging and it
was Maggie's lol but this is the dress
that Maggie had and I knew I'd be
obsessed with and I'm so obsessed wait I
tied in a little bow but I don't know if
it supposed to be just a knot but it's
so cute and what she showed me is it has
like little like lining thing on the
bottom like shorts which I love because
it's been kind of windy here and I'll be
wearing a dress and it'll be a few
