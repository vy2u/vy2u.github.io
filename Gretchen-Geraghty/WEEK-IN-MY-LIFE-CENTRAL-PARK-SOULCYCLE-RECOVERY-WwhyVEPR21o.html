and I just kind of Nava caught it that
I'm gonna try to eat and we'll look at
how perfect it looks I mean it's gonna
require a little bit of chewing but it's
like a really soft and I think I'll be
okay I put two little baby sweet
potatoes in the microwave and I'm gonna
try to like mash up and make like mashed
sweet potatoes I'm out this morning for
breakfast I made an acai bowl that was
really liquidy with no toppings because
I literally can't chew so the saddest
acai bowl ever I posted that on my story
I got some pudding I got some Go Go
squeezes and I also got some yogurt oh
and I got ice cream - I haven't had
normal ice cream in so long because you
guys know like I was vegan and then I
haven't really like eaten ice cream that
much since I haven't been vegan but this
just reminded me so much of my freshman
year of college me and my roommate
micaiah would like eat one of these
everyday so I just got fish food and
like lift a couple bites back yes you're
that because I'm literally gonna do and
I need to dodge all of the fudge fishies
but yeah and I think I'm gonna start
boosting blogs my main channel I'm just
gonna have like one or two a week over
across a couple of days so that they're
like more interesting and fun because I
probably will blog in today because like
morning fuzzy socks and like doing
chores and editing and relaxing all day
because I'm healing okay from my wound
just wanted to give you guys an update
that my mouth is doing better I am
finishing a PB&amp;amp;J so I want to real food
now which is really exciting and you
guys remember from my last haul I got
these pj pants that match at this top
from urban and this came in the mail
yesterday and I love it I'm just gonna
put on some workout clothes right now
because I'm gonna try to go to SoulCycle
with my friend Justin Juicy J as you
guys know him and I haven't worked out
and a couple days since I got my teeth
pulled because I didn't want to like
make myself feel worse you know and I'm
actually really excited to go because I
ordered these SoulCycle shoes online so
now I'm gonna have my own and I want if
like Brent dirty old clothes ones from
the studio so I'm so excited and I show
these are my insta story yesterday on
Instagram if you follow me oh my gosh
this mirror so dirty so I'm going to
this whole cycle all the way up in the
Upper West Side like West 60th Street I
think but that's just because that's
where Justin works he works up there he
has an internship at Prada I think we
told you guys about that before but
anyway so I'm actually going to
Starbucks up there beforehand cuz I
don't know how long it's gonna take me
to get there so I just don't wanna be
late so I'm gonna go chill at a
Starbucks do some work and then like
meet him there I just want to show you
guys I'm wearing my new gym shark outfit
so yeah it's just like it's really
pretty like burgundy color I think I
showed it back at my house before I came
back to New York with like Lucy and
Taylor the other week but I'm like
obsessed with it and I'm so excited to
wear it and soul/psyche looks I feel
like people always just wear like the
cutest little matching sets and soul
it just really inspires me oh and of
course I will have it linked down below
I'll put it first right in the
description box you guys can find it
super easy Oh remember your first time

people and you can like move in and know
how it's like a mess yes maybe yeah do
you have anything to say to the vlog oh
my god this is like when we're at Rosa
mexicana yeah Rosa Mexicano and I always
say Rosa mexicana I thought there was
mexicana because you have to match today
I think it's the Rosa Mexicano oh my god
it's an arrow someone probably would let
us know I thought it would be matching
the AIDS too but I know it's like it's
feminine okay maybe it's masculine of
dimension
this is a cute area everyone live in
barbarous idling once that's the nicest
restaurant I've ever been to good
morning New York today I can only say
that like one more day shows that we had
plans I'm a really fun last Friday of me
