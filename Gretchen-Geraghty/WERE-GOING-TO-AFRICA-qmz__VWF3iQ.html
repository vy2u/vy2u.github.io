basically we're going to Africa but hey
guys so we're going to Africa yeah this
is so weird a like doesn't feel real yet
but basically I just want to make this
video for you guys to let you know that
we're going to Africa and obviously I'm
going with Sasha Oh to Natasha's I'm
Sasha
yeah so we're going in May and it's
actually through bu it's like this group
of us that are going and we're going for
charity and we're gonna hike Mount
Kilimanjaro and it's gonna be so fun
yeah I just want to make this video for
you guys like really quick so that you
can donate if you want to because we're
actually fundraising money we're raising
money for child cancer so it's called
something through the B+ foundation and
that started with a boy named Andrew
McDonough and he actually passed away
when he was 14 it's very sad and tragic
but he had leukemia but was really sad
about it was well this is actually
uplifting is that his blood type was B+
so basically the motto the family was
you know let's be positive for him and
so they made actually a foundation that
now is a worldwide sensation and what
they do is they fund cancer research
they find events for kids they raise
awareness it's really for a great cause
that's so good okay so I was going to
say is we're fund raising money so that
we can go because basically we have a
goal that we have to reach and most the
proceeds goes to the research for the
kids and to the foundation and also it
goes into the trip costs you know
because we're trying to reach out to
Africa yeah we'll probably film when
were there too which will be fun
yeah I like share with you guys I'm
probably gonna bring a GoPro so you'll
get my perspective of a fun stuff
listen to Gretchen complain oh we caught
a mountain that's 16,000 oh wait yeah I
don't even think we told you it's the
tallest freestanding mountain so it's
just like by itself and it's the second
tallest it's like one of the tallest
mouth it's not the dormant volcano that
mmm you know good blow really no no no
no so I'm really nervous that I'm gonna
get out seat sickness but you know we'll
see a show before
you'll be fine okay I didn't even tell
you if you guys want to donate to the
foundation which i think is so great
like obviously we're gonna donate money
too and I already have but whatever
we'll have the links to our donation
pages linked in the down bars you guys
can check them out what sit down bar can
they don't look in the description box
okay it makes sense yeah it's gonna be a
great time you know fine we're gonna
raise money for a good cause we're gonna
show you guys what it's like especially
going a new continent that neither of us
have been to yeah obviously never been
to Africa and I feel like I'm like I get
so nervous in like a new situation and
stuff so it's gonna be like really
different but I think it something
really good for me is like a person and
it's probably gonna be like
life-changing not to be like too deep so
like it it's literally gonna be so cool
so I'm like I feel really lucky like
yeah I just lucky that we have this
opportunity that we can do yeah we're
gonna be going and you know there's me
elephants and little stuff like which is
her favorite no probably gonna be going
with us and they're gonna be no cell
service we're all is he just gonna have
like no makeup I don't know if I'm gonna
wave but I'll figure it out for instance
one of the days we wake up at 4:00 in
the morning and we end up actually
trekking for 6:00 on it right it's a day
you go to this on it no the day before
that a day before yeah and like oh yeah
we're checking for six days well it gets
like a ten day like trip but you Trek
for six days and it like berries every
day so I know like one of the first days
is probably shorter like five six hours
but then it goes up to like 10 or like
15 it's gonna be a lot we have to like
be in really good shape I'm gonna like
run more definitely consider donating if
you guys want to like don't there's no
oppression yeah don't feel like you have
to but just like I think it's such a
great cause I would donate even if I
wasn't going to you know I mean so
definitely if you want to delete down
below and you can literally donate $1
was like a million no one is kidding but
like you can donate go to and you know
what I mean 300 yeah like you don't like
2010 everything counts I feel like I
don't know what there's like a minimum
on there like on the website they might
say like you can't do it really could be
centrally you don't know but literally
if you donate a dollar like that's so
generous and so nice video anyway thank
you and we'd really appreciate it too
because it's not really even for us
yeah it's obviously not dress at all
it's for like research for childhood
cancer segments oh also something really
cool
that now we're going to be basically a
part of this foundation we go down to
Boston Medical well you sure it up with
like a buddy
it's like read to them and like hang out
with them and you find just makes it a
life overall a better experience yeah we
can't do this without you guys we can't
do this without you know the support of
everyone that we have and so we look
forward to it yeah it's gonna be fine
it still doesn't feel real like it
hasn't giveyou net worth actually going
like I said he's gonna donate money for
our trip to Africa and for Reaser for
the people as foundation it will be
