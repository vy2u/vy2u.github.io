what I ate in the day and yeah it's
obviously all vegan and I wanted this to
be like a pretty typical day in terms of
what I'm eating but it wasn't at all I
eat like random stuff and this normally
is nowadays so we try to do a better one
coming soon when I eat like three square
meals look at the dining hall and stuff
but anyway today I went for a run this
wonderful on Monday morning and I'm a
different person I can't run I'm empty
stomach so I work out at all you know
with no fuel on me so I usually just
won't eat like half of Larabar just
something really small because I don't
like to feel like cool or anything so
yeah I just say the capital R bar and
then after I go to the dining hall and
this big bowl of oatmeal with some
peanut butter and bananas in the back
from breakfast you know we're both
running late to our 11 a.m. classes so
we actually both overed to class
together you know they weren't like in
the same building when she's in charge a
and I'm in classroom and I forgot to
show it but I actually the other half of
my Laura bar on my way to class because
somehow I'm always hungry I just got a
salad at Buick which is what I do like a
lot of taste for lunch
and usually he me with the pull salad
because it's it really big so I like the
first half probably like one o'clock
fish and now it's 150 and I have to
write a paper then mEEMIC I ever going
to go didn't go very fast morning like
5:15 5:30 and then I think my gets
weaker and I'm literally getting hungry
again I get hungry like so easily I
think I'm gonna have the rest of my
salad and like I said I already had the
first half or at Olympia so that I'll
just tell you guys what I get my salads
are it's like not pretty there wasn't
much left you know just get romaine
spinach cranberries eat I literally love
peas carrots avocados so they did it
strawberry so I threw those no it's
going either the cupcake you're still
gonna like so I mean like
yeah no no I agree there so that was it
actually you know sending about what
it's still good no it's singing up this
is the but I managed to get one I got
one too she convinced me dessert before
dinner is always hot delicious right
it's so good I honestly like would
starve and we want two days to get your
shredding kale it's so cool I know
you've even do it like that like I said
this wasn't really a typical day
obviously music I rap like it's date
night so I normally don't have to salad
for lunch and dinner but this salad is
so good guys with sweet green is called
the tree mommy you have to go try it we
just shared it but really I look stupid

in the moment I and I got back from
there we ate some of these at peanut
butter balls which are seriously amazing
guys Lucy made them for us I think I had
about two of them so that was just like
the end of the second when I was eating
but we just used this Trader Joe's
peanut butter agave some coconut and
some chocolate chips and they're so good
