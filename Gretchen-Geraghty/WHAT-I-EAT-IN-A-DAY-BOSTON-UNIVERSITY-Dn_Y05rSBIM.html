well even if it's not morning for you I
hope you're having a great day and today
I just thought I would vlog because I
feel like I start every vlog off like
that do i I think I do but I just
thought I would vlog because I thought
it would be helpful to show you guys
what I eat in a day in college and I try
to eat pretty healthy and also Lucy and
I have some fun plans for this afternoon
I just thought it'd be a good way to
de-stress and you know enjoy Boston so
yeah I will show you that later on and
right now I'm making some oatmeal which
is like my go-to and this is just the
maple brown sugar kind I put some of
this vanilla almond butter in it like
you guys know I do and I take a super
super ripe banana like this thing it's
super ripe and I put it in there too so
we've got our oatmeal obviously I put
like usually about two like spoonfuls of
almond butter and then banana and I
usually drink this whole Nalgene water
bottle I put a Camelback top on it I
drink probably I would say two to three
and on a really good day four of them
I'm headed off to my calculus class and
a night finance class I'm in a class
it's a what Oh frog from yesterday was
he so good at her braids we should do a
tutorial reunited with my Lu I realized
it's my last finance class so because we
have finals next week right now like
what we didn't die so we're just going
to tell you everything the eighth and
you guys saw the opening I had this
morning and that was like only like what
like three hours ago I literally get
hungry like every three hours and I know
that's good for your metabolism to to
eat like every three hours or so so I
usually try to do that and so we're just
snacking on some pistachios I think
they're not the best nuts for you cuz I
feel like really really salty or
something but yeah I don't know I just
like love them so whatever you just need
some salt in your diet and then Lucy
will just tell you what sheet this
morning because obviously you didn't get
to see it but she had an apple with
almond butter right before this when I
met up with Lucy I went to the dining
hall and stole some bagels so we have
bagels to feed the birds it's like
really dark oh look at that the lighting
so much better whatever
shoukyou they are be surprised
this is our surprise destination
tired so guys I just wanted to let you
know that you know I lost my wallet
and so that I may be not that same
person that was just uneasily like I
keep good track of myself and also I'm
not represent a lot of cash on me just
in this instance I did like just a
couple of days I had a bunch of cash my
wallet of course and I use it because I
was traveling so that really stings and
also my credit card was an item I didn't
see my like everything like my driver's
license so loose you know I'd go to go
to this concert last night issue a
subsidy to go to it to be a tuner about
and I had my student ID else it'll be
fine
and the guy when we were like going in
he was like sorry we only take passport
or driver's licenses and I was like oh
my gosh I got going to believe it and I
was like come on Ella say looking at
this 18 I have 19 and I'm like she 19
chosen driver's license like we're twin
sisters but he was like sorry I was so
sad and we were some 70 so yeah no I
said in general so I was excited to go
but you get we look up at IO but we
haven't tried again hopefully they're
good this place is a human middle I love
it look at all those bananas look how
good does this look
I've never had this one yours looks so
good - ours are both so pink that was so
good with the coconut I love coconut
mine eyes like almond butter chia seed
raspberries granola and there's all
these birds that we can feed our bagels
to we just decided to come to Copley
Square we're going to go to Boston
Commons but that's like a 15 minute walk
that way so we were just like hey we'll
just eat here update this is like the
yummies thing I've eaten my entire life
oh also chain cos I like felt kind of I
don't know if you look to it appropriate
for class I just think you're I don't
know whatever it's doing I like it oh
and the reason this is really good -
that I didn't even know is there's
banana chunks in there and I was like
what was that and it's so good in like
our nevere hotel he's really show big
throw hard to finish you can't believe
we got pictures of that contrast man
yeah I was really excited
stop I said to Lucy you know things
happen for a reason so we'll figure it
out it means that maybe when I take her
to a new concert over the summer it'll
be even better you know I don't know
we'll see we decided to feed the birds
like we said and I was getting mad
because there wasn't enough and now
there's like 50 you wanted him away no
throw them farther I'm not kidding
there's so many all of a sudden there
was like none before I was it come on
now there's so many think I did 90
want it look at that guy's missing Lucy
keeps saying I gotta go hi go for it
little guy I'm scared
we're all like in the grass before and I
was like come on and then they came oh I
like the little cute ones they're so
cute what kind of birds are you I'm
excuse me a little birdie what kind are
you is that one like sick or pregnant I
don't know it would like touch my leg so
this is just our it's like a little
market at BU and they have really good
salads that we're gonna get like we
always get salads here
yeah but are you the to save on the
bottom is mean yeah your son salads
figure out those noodles hopefully do
you mean I took a role in nearly didn't
show meaning role oh very exciting cute
lol just crying like you my voice again
guys I'm such a emotional wreck if I
like actually think about it why I'm
crying it's kind of ridiculous you know
like I really shouldn't be but okay
instead of keep telling you that I am
crying largely explain why um Justin's
mom just snapchatting me and they said
r.i.p Jeff and if you guys didn't know
Jeff is Justin's beta fish-- Wallace was
just as beta bitch and I just like to
use a good fish Anna yeah I feel
connected to him
you should feel connected to most cuz
I'm dressing in me and his family was in
Aruba Lucy took care of Jeff and I don't
know I just really liked Jeff I think
the reason I care so much is because I
know that Justin like like love Jeff a
lot so I just feel bad like I like feel
for him you know yeah and I called him
and I was like say it isn't so
he was like I know he was sick it was
like POW but why he was like you like
Gretchen it's okay he's just a fish I
was like no you loved him yeah okay yeah
I do I think
yet he was more than just a betta fish
because he taught him literally such a
buzz why is it crying but yeah to me
he's more than just a betta fish I think
because Justin ton of all these tricks
he taught him these tricks that he I
think he like looked up videos maybe to
teach him or something and was like
Percy taught him I think with look at
pencils like with an eraser
he'd go like that the top of the
fishbowl and like go like that and Jeff
would jump and
also with your finger if you like went
like that on the water and like tapped
it Jeff would come up and like bite your
finger something like I don't know II
like thought of all these like tricks
because it was like a pet you know and
he loved him so yeah I don't know I need
to get myself together but I came in
here just listen I've had like an even
salad we couldn't eat them earlier
because we had eaten our smoothie bowls
too close to and we got our salads you
know um but also we learned the hard way
that this salad place on campus that we
love closes at 7:00 and sometimes I even
pack a little early so it's better to
get your salads earlier in the day and
then because if you're going to eat like
it's like 7:30 right now
because if you can only eat after 7:00
you can just you know like have it in
your room but I wanted to tell you what
I got in mind that is what it looks like
mm-hmm they're really big - okay so I
got some corn I got to hear me I'm like
not only just like congested I congested
I'm only congested from just like crying
but I'm like if you like her to be
talking you're a lady - I'm like
congested if I throw hair it's like I
actually think I'm like sick or getting
sick I've always sick but anyways I've
chord I have there's like a dried
cranberry I love dried cranberries
I have beets I have like those really
cooked beets that are like in cubes I
didn't like beets so I came to college
and then me a beet star daddy call and I
learned I really like them and then
there's some major oranges right there
there's some broccoli and oh of course
avocado right there you can't really see
it but it's kind of like buried in there
there's avocado and I get spinach in row
made and I get balsamic dressing on top
of all of this and also it's good about
eating healthy like sex I've been trying
to a consciously like a lot healthy
recently I'd like when you eat like
really healthy like plant-based like you
could eat a lot more cuz stuff is so
like not it's like I don't know how to
describe it yeah it's like the foods in
themselves you're like low calorie or
they're very like watered-down
type of thing you know like lettuce I
heard the other day like a pound of
lettuce legit has like 30 calories 60
calories like nothing so you can eat so
much of it and you have to make sure
you're eating enough calories during the
day so like this salad is like like I
don't know if you can tell but like it's
get massive and it's going to take me
like probably ten or fifteen minutes to
eat the whole thing because it's so big
but like you can and you should because
like the whole thing itself isn't that
many calories you know because it's like
so many other foods and vegetables but
anyways oh I wanted to film a video this
year I know it's so exciting
where well I'll talk about it it's like
it's looking announcement video pretty
much but basically Lucy and I made a
summer bucket list and that should be up
oh is it gonna go before this video
after this video honestly I'll probably
put it up before this video just because
I don't know why not it's like a fun
announcement video oh you put lemon in
your salad yeah but I was squishing up
my hands and in my hands rule on me Oh
Lucy has stopped liking salad dressing
she's very picky and she just like puts
a lemon juice on top which is probably
even better for you than sell a dress
think we made the bucket list we made
like literally a hundred things over the
past couple of days
like what like prioritize like what we
really want to do over the summer and
it'll just be fun to have like a guide
to make sure we have a great summer you
know oh yeah so we're gonna like film
right now but I've just been like crying
because of a betta fish dying so I don't
know if I can get myself together maybe
ofall but ya ever I'm showing that
you're eating - would you put in your
salad it basically all lettuce romaine
spinach sprouts coppery like sprouts I
don't like them um almonds mm-hmm
avocado and lemon yeah I can smell the
lemon from here berry lemon we forgot we
got those kale pesto noodles - the color
of my spudger yeah they're so green wait
so I don't get it is like the noodles
themselves made with kale yeah oh you
think yeah in the pesto yeah I thought
it would the noodles are made out of
tail no the noodles are linguini Oh
organic wheat something something
sunflower oil olive oil almonds kale
garlic sea salt first reaction that's
really good it's good I really like
pesto and I feel like I'm picky with my
pesto's I don't like that I don't like
with pesto Zoila especially when you can
taste it kind of separates out over
it's like Gracie that's good hmm oh my
gosh
this is gonna be a vlogger officially
cuz I'd like you feel better part of my
blogs and videos for a while but
probably for while the four years I've
been on YouTube
probably for four years people have
asked you to make a channel and it's
always been like it was just not like
really for I feel you've just been
hesitant and like we're so yeah yeah
that's that's exactly it for so long you
have just said a weird yeah you're just
like YouTube's your thing I don't to
copy you people are gonna think that I'm
copying you like taking your life like
you know I don't phone me taking your
thing but like I have always said like
no way that's not it at all you can be
on YouTube - oh my gosh wow this is such
an exciting video what did you okay so
since this is just gonna be like what do
we eat in a day video as we said where's
breakfast chatter Apple and almond
butter oh this is almond butter guys Wow
where'd you get again star yeah this is
called Barney butter almond butter
peanut free gluten free smooth blah blah
blah this is it like one day Lucy's like
try it and I was like I played almond
butters on my go haul ass I ate the
entire packet that in there just like
like that so so good anyways and then
she had some pistachios with me we are
snacking on her way we're just walking
into town and then she had a Pattaya
Bowl yeah they're like specifically
they're like Pattaya bowls and if you
want to look up who goes fosston you can
look up she got the Monta the Deo
pettalia Bowl if you like have way too
much spare time and want to see what we
was on what we ate and I had like almond
milk and bananas oh yeah
Pattaya the big coconut blueberries
Gruber no Lola
yeah a lot eme stuff in an Iowan that
was kind of like that mine was called
Santo Domingo
so actually you know I don't know link
who goes down below like the website
just because we really really like
smoothie bowls and they're like so yummy
and like good for you so I made a lot of
studies because I don't like drinking
things yeah Lucy doesn't like drinking
smoothies because they fill her up too
much so this is like a really like Thank
You videos oh yeah because it does fill
you awesome so it's more like food
instead of a drink I feel yeah yeah I
agree
I'll just let you down below in case you
actually live in Boston and you want to
like go to whoo go so if you haven't
heard of it it's like so small okay
showed in there it's like a little like
a little shack and like Copley Square
but it's like so great because their
food is so good it smells so fresh in
there like fruits and vegetables and
also even if you're not from Boston or
even close to Boston you can just look
at the foods they have and maybe if you
want to try to recreate like the foods
they have it might be a good idea like
probably when we go home for the summer
we can try to make like cool smoothie
bowls and stuff like that you know like
in and it shows like ingredients that
they use so it might give you some in
SPO oh yeah then we just had our salads
and now we're having some kale and pesto
noodles and then why I ate today it was
I had my maple brown sugar it's just the
Quaker one the instant one oatmeal that
I put my vanilla almond butter in from
Justin's that's like the brand and I
slice up a banana in there and if my
bananas too big I will just like eat the
other half you know if I put like half
in there I just eat the other half and
then I hacks mustachios for a little
snack and I pitaya Bowl and my salad on
a some kale and pesto noodles so that is
just traditional what I eat in a day
this is the brand by the way I don't
know if they have other places if it's
just like a BU family are they have a
legal Oh probably cold foods or
something everyone a chocolate rice cake
with peanut butter if you guys don't
know I like show this before I feel good
videos it would JIT taste like a racy
cup well I guess to me maybe not to
other people but it's so good and also I
usually use like well I used to use like
in shift peanut butter like the most
like unhealthy like I don't know like
sugary kind of peanut butter but then
recently
Lucy's got me into Teddy's smooth
old-fashioned all-natural peanut butter
which is just look a lot better for you
I don't really know why
okay maybe like less sugar okay it's the
ingredients dry roasted peanuts and salt
does all mm-hmm I literally can't
believe it though I was two ingredients
that's insane alright thank you so much
for watching go try a chocolate rice
cake with me but it's really yummy
I'll see you my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
