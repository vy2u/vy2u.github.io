peanut butter and banana and this is how
it looks this is like my go-to like
breakfast because you get your fruit
with the banana you get some carbs and
then like peanut butter because I just
love peanut butter and obviously has
like a lot of protein as you can tell
this video is like vlog style and I'm
kind of doing it on purpose to see like
how it goes on my main channel because
and I mentioned it on my blog channel
but Lucy is actually going to be taking
over our vlog channel instead of having
it be Gretchen and Lucy our shared log
channels and she is going abroad in the
fall to Paris we just thought it would
be really easy to have our own channels
and then it kind of just is separate
like I my own channel she has her own
and it's like we're two separate people
instead of like me and her blog channel
you know today's little vlog video is
going to be kind of like what I eat in a
day like help you guys out and show you
like what I eat cuz I get that question
a lot and this video is actually
sponsored by lysosome and thank you so
much like some for sponsoring this video
because I've actually been trying out
like some for a while now ever since I
saw Aspen talked about in her videos you
guys know me and my friend Taylor are
like obsessed with Aspen Parker's videos
they're like so cute and she was just
talking all about it in a blog and I was
like whoa like I need this basically if
you guys don't know but kind of like I
don't like to think of it as like
calorie counting but you can see like
your target calories and then you like
put in all of the food that you're like
eating for the day so like for breakfast
I'll put in oatmeal peanut butter banana
and then it'll say that I'm like on
target for like my breakfast calories
like that and I talked about this app
actually in a vlog before I use it to
like make sure that I'm not eating too
much but also enough because I don't
know if you guys can relate to this but
you guys feel like you're me like you'll
get a really healthy mindset and like I
need to eat healthy like I remember the
beginning of the summer when I moved to
New York City I only bought fruits and
vegetables which like is it good like
you need like healthy fats and carbs and
everything but I was like I'm only in
eat fruits and vegetables be really
healthy and then you do that for like a
week and then you're like well look I'm
still hungry like I'm craving like bread
and then you go crazy and eat like 4,000
calories in a day and then you feel like
awful you know what I mean like you just
feel like bloated and like gross so I
literally wanted to use this app just to
make sure that I wasn't eating too much
but also like enough and of the right
things because I feel like since I've
started using it I've noticed that I
probably don't eat enough protein but
also what's really cool about life some
you have like your carbs
and fat but you can change like the
levels or like the grams that you want
to consume per day based on like what
you want for your diet I would say no
I'm like not really active I used to be
like very active when I was obviously
rowing do you want FPU and I'd say now I
work out maybe four or five six times a
week so yeah I just feel like 1700 1800
calories like somewhere in there is good
I don't pay attention to the calories
like too much as long as I'm just eating
like balance like healthy meals and also
what I really like is that you can add
water in the bottom because I really
like enjoy drinking water no Sun stuff
but I know that a lot of people forget
to drink water and I'm usually pretty
good with it like when I'm home
especially when I'm in New York you're
like traveling a lot is an issue because
you guys know my travel a bunch this
summer just for having my internship
with Joe and just traveling to like see
friends and family and stuff and
whenever I'm traveling I just forget to
drink water because you're just so busy
like traveling and everything so I
really like that you can track it on
here you can add your exercise own it
has like things that I've eaten before
reset Larabar granola cups Gatorade eggs
pancakes chocolate croissants okay maybe
I haven't been eating as healthy as I
thought oat meal and then peanut butter
I honestly probably have two tablespoons
of that so you can change it to a whole
banana and there's breakfast oats I'm 44
calories under but I think the oatmeal
that I'm eating might be more than like
what I put in there because I think this
is more than 381 calories so that is
breakfast and then you can see you just
add lunch dinner snacks exercise oh also
it's really cool they have this life
score little test and it's just like
this quiz that you take and you say how
much you eat processed foods fried foods
fruits vegetables stuff like that and
it'll tell you like how you're doing so
for me it says I can eat more fruit and
take I used to be better with fruit but
now like living in New York City I've
just been really bad because if it goes
bad so quick so buying it it's just like
harder and I just buy stuff that like
stays good longer and I like eat out a
lot so haven't been doing too hot this
summer but I'm trying my best and this
helps me like stay on track isn't that
cool yeah what is it how does it know
what you have to do more of it says so I
took this score and I told them like
oh my god no I like answered all these
questions of like how many times a week
do we eat processed foods and I'm like
oh boy
moderate exercise healthy it was good it
was like quick I think it was like 40
questions so not bad so I guess I could
be a little bit healthier oh I could
have 20 more points and be perfect I
want to let you guys know that it's like
totally free and you can download it
I'll have the link in my bio because
it's just been really helpful this
summer so go download it check it out
he's such a bad example of a day because
it's 2 p.m. and I'm eating breakfast you
know what I'm eatin so like obviously
I'm very hungry from not eating all
morning so that's like bad and they need
to get better with that so like this
just helps me again to be like okay
since I'm not eating until like 2 p.m.
I'm gonna have to eat like lunch and
dinner sooner more close together do you
know what I mean cause like I'll still
be hungry and I still like made the
calories update I'm eating a DS crunchy
peanut butter and it's really good I've
never really had oatmeal with like
crunchy peanut butter I've always you
smooth but like couldn't stop I don't I
have to be really careful because
yesterday I cracked my tooth and I might
actually end up having to go to the
dentist today because I'm really scared
yeah I don't know my dad gave me a list
of like places that like our insurance
covers in here City and I'm gonna call
him up and be like hi fix me but I don't
know if I'm gonna go today I'm kind of
nervous to go somewhere that isn't like
my dentist at home you know but we'll
see I keep forgetting about it though so
I like to on that side and I'm like yeah
I'm gonna show you guys I think I'm
gonna do like a day in the life of an
intern I think I've showed this before
but um I really hope I'm allowed to show
this by the way Tasha and I oh my god
this is so cute summer day night she
always makes like the cover images and
then I'll add like gifts and like
YouTube videos so the joke pics and this
is just like the back end of it like I'm
the internal tool so I'm just about to
post this right now
and I'm talking really quiet I don't
want people to think I'm there yeah the
doctor said that I have to get it cold I
cracked the word would like to know not
to go it's like that one way back there
so you can't tell but no no I'm just
going home who just got back from the
dentist and I think I cried more so
because I was like overwhelmed and like
kind of surprised like shocked then
actually like sad because it's okay and
after walking back and just reflecting
England krachan it's not the end of the
world you always like overreact over
these things and yeah I don't think I
can really like show you guys well
actually I'll insert the picture of my
x-ray right here and it's only on the
outside of my tooth so you can only see
that that part of the root like broke
off and is in my gum and that's like
kind of not good too so I made an
appointment Monday morning 9:30 and
today's Friday so like I couldn't go to
Mars today an oral surgeon here in New
York City so that they can hold my tooth
which is says but I know it's not the
end the world like I got my wisdom teeth
out it won't be as bad as that and then
I think I just have to let it heal and
there's literally gonna be a gap in the
back of my mouth until I go home and get
like a fake tooth or whenever do any of
you guys are like fake teeth like is
that like normal like I don't know but
anyway since we all know that me and my
roommate had a look about like two
because we sleep all day long it is now
five sixteen and my internal clock is
just way off cuz we've been staying up
like all night like we just yeah so I
feel like it's afternoon but it's like
almost night in five sixteen but I'm
drinking and this juice that he had
because I was like you know I'm starting
to like get hungry I'm just editing
videos right now I posted my dope pick
list earlier this is just a raw kale and
apple juice and it is from
juice press press two three I don't know
something like that but it's literally
the only ingredients
it's like kale apple that's it I know
it's like really clean and like good for
me because I know so many like health
juices or just filled with sugar and
stuff like that so like you want to get
ones like these that are like actually
really healthy yeah I'm just gonna add
that into my life so my diary and I've
been good with drinking water day I've
been bringing my hydro flask everywhere
with me
I get so many questions about this this
is just a 32 ounce hydro class I got it
on Amazon and I loved it
and I need to survive this hit me top
two because I don't have to save you top
I just physically will not drink it like
I won't drink the water because you have
to unscrew the top and that's too hard
oh and what's really cool is I forgot to
show you guys this earlier but sends a
little juice I'm drinking has a barcode
on it when you have like snacks or
something see there's a little section
that says scan barcode and then when you
click on it it just brings you to like a
little camera like that and you just
scan over the barcode they'll just put
it in your food diary automatically so
that's so nice when you have like food
that you buy that has barcodes on it
because then it just goes in there that
much easier and you don't have to like
search for it since I don't know which
point in my life as you know I'm bad
videos when people flip out okay who
else feels like their life is in an
ongoing crisis because me and addi do we
just do okay everyone is now seven oh
seven pm and I just want to show you
sorry this is like a mess and I just
brought it on my bed so I could show you
because we don't have much room in our
little apartment but I got some broccoli
and hummus courtesy of Kirk because she
went full-on grocery shopping right
before she left so I'm just eating this
is like a little snack and then put that
green juice I drink before in to my
little life
food calendar thing as a snack so I
think I'm gonna make this like lunch but
you know when you sleep till 2 you don't
really have meals you have a
snacky-snack you like during the day I
don't even know like it's confusing but
like I mean normally this one happened
and I'm so proud of me like we're about
to eat like everything at home today and
normally I go out to eat like every
single meal so I'm like really proud of
myself
this isn't like too accurate because
most days include like a sweet green
salad put in there somewhere because I
never like want to make salads I just
like sweet green ones better and it's
like so close to where I live so I just
do that I'm just gonna eat some of these
Joel what I eat in a day because I have
my own meal having some hummus and
broccoli I had my green juice and we are
making soup potatoes and chicken and for
dinner nice and healthy
so guys now it is dinner time and I just
have this grilled chicken avocado and
sweet potato so I'm just gonna put it
all in the app and I think I might still
be under a little bit today because it
still isn't like too much food I woke up
still late at like I'm like not even
that hungry that much you know but I
might like grab a couple of snacks later
that I could like throw in like some
because it's like eight something right
now so yeah so you can see I just added
for dinner maybe avocado baked sweet
potato and roasted chicken and it says
it's 383 calories so like that's really
low for dinner so I'll probably go eat
like some crackers and like juice or
something but I just want to show you
guys like how that worked and definitely
don't forget to go at download life some
for free totally free especially with my
mishap with my two that I also have to
be really careful eating and like I'm
not really in the mood to eat that much
just because the tooth back there is
really cracked and I have to get it
pulled it from the orthopedic surgeon on
Monday so I don't can only two on this
side anyway but yeah thank you guys for
watching taste vlog and I'll see you
next month bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
