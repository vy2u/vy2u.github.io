forever holiday you celebrate
I just finished opening at presents with
my family and this is just so exciting
to be showing you guys what I got for
Christmas because I don't my gosh
I've been over three years now and easy
which is like so crazy to me and I'm
gonna try to get very quick usually I
talk way too long but I'm gonna have the
years of past videos linked down below
and also if you are new to my channel
don't forget to subscribe it's somewhere
down below just click on that so you can
be notified when I post new videos also
you should follow me on my Instagram my
Twitter they'll always be linked down
below and add me on snapchat so without
further ado let's just get on into it so
the first thing I asked both of my
parents with donations for my trip to
Africa and if you guys have been
following me along you know that move to
be going to Africa mag I'm going to be
liking Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania to
raise money for childhood cancer fatal
video artists also that link down below
so you can see more about it if you're
interested
there also have the link down below so
you guys can donate if you're interested
in proceeds go to research for childhood
cancer and is large trip is for so but
I'm on prints on a picture of a lion
it says African four hundred dollars so
thank you so much mom and dad for
donating and it's such a great cause I
can't wait to go and just be part of it
so the next thing I got is just this
spike roller which I wanted it so bad
because my calves get so tight and this
is like the only thing that can help
make them feel better and when normal
foam rollers work good too but for me
this bike one is the best and it like
hurts so good if that makes sense I just
love this and I just got this at Dick's
some of these Christmas presents
Gretchen got for herself from Gretchen
the next time I got are just being so
strong Bath &amp;amp; Body Works oh and if you
guys know I live in a suite with seven
other girls and so I share a bathroom
with three of the girls cuz two
bathrooms in our suite so I just got a
bunch of these at Bath &amp;amp; Body Works oh I
got peach Bellini
season twisted peppermint and black
cherry Merlot but and these smell really
good
also I don't have them with me I feel it
for Christmas you oh we need a good pair
of pajamas so Gretchen got herself some
pajamas from Victoria's Secret and I
don't even have them with me because
they came in they're hideous and I just
did not like them so I returned them and
now I have a gift card to give a new
pair so it's like I almost got pajamas
but not really the next thing are just
these at compression leggings they're
like the cwx brand they're black and if
you guys know I'm actually running a
half marathon in the spring in Oklahoma
with your probably Gretchen why are you
going to Oklahoma that's what everyone
says to me at least probably a lot of
you from Oklahoma hey what's up to my
friend Anna it's from Oklahoma and she's
actually running the full marathon so
I'm gonna be running the half so I'll be
running the half way with her and
compression leggings are literally a
must they help out so much but the ones
I have for 2xu hey I got those last
Christmas - guys remember those I feel
like just haven't worked though well
maybe they do but just for me others
have really noticed a difference and
I've heard that these are better and I
can already feel they're a lot like
thicker and these I just got on Amazon
so these are also cheaper than the 2x
key ones and they just look cool so I'm
excited to try these out the next time I
got is just a closed-form naked and the
first thing I got is just this top that
I'm wearing right now it's like this
beautiful like silky tan kind of crops
like v-neck and has been built in choker
and I just love it I think it's so
beautiful so I'm so excited that I got
this and all the clothes that I have for
naked I'll have links down below
everything in here if I can find the
links to our own link in the description
box so it's easier to find for you guys
in the next dress I got is so beautiful
custom black dress with like this slit
and this I just been seeing around a lot
with this style of dress I just think
it's sewing right now and I still queue
I think one of our new years and in the
next time I got is just this a black top
that like laces up the front and has
cutouts in the shoulders and it's just
this beautiful like black simple blouse
and I know it's on sale so I got this
for a really good deal and I'm really
excited about that
anyway guys I technically didn't get for
Christmas exactly because I got them
like a recent
in my head they're silly for Christmas
because this I've been wearing around
recently looking the past week or two
and I've been getting so many questions
on it so this is just this tan really
really soft knit sweater with like a
cute cowl-neck turtleneck type thing
going on so this is where make it to you
and like I said I'll have it linked down
below love this this is my go-to and
then I got two other shirts I don't know
where I put them but one I'll just
insert pictures of them one is just this
white long-sleeve a crop top that's like
kind of higher on the neck because I
just think that's really cute and I
really that style right now so I also
got a Miss black and white short sleeves
tight crop top same thing and it goes up
a little bit higher on the neck so I
think these are both so cute as well I
really hope my camera is in focus right
now because I will get to that present
but the next thing I got is just this
hydro flask it's just the white one and
you guys know I actually have this one
in the 24 ounce one but it's just too
small if I drink one sip and it's like
empty so I just knew that I wanted a
bigger one and I just got the 30 x one
and also I felt like I didn't drink out
of it enough because I just had to screw
on top but I feel like with like this 50
table I like drink more so I got this
tippy top as well then the next thing I
got or just these LL Bean slippers that
I'm wearing it currently oh my gosh
don't tell I'm filming in sweat pants
because when you film you can only see
your top but I'm wearing sweatpants
because they're comfy I got these
elevated slippers I'm wearing right now
in these I wanted to show bad guys you
guys know my best friend Taylor that
goes to be you with me and she was my
sweet now and last year her roommate
Katie I would go into her room Cage was
around and I literally put on her
slippers and walk around in them because
they're neither Barry sub comfy so I was
like okay got you need to get your own
pair this year I was like Katie I was
like I wear those so much last year so I
just got my own than the brown ones and
I'm super fuzzy they're sold out online
so it's freaky now but Santa came
through he found him in the stores I
think so
love these then I just know this book at
milk and honey is
doesn't really see me to share because
our desert is such good things out of
this so I can't wait to read these poems
then I discover there's a black baby
things - it's just this theta one for
swimming because Lucy and I actually see
on the swim team
fun fact so we just got any bathing
suits first domain for like working out
because I like really my swimming I want
to get back into it so I just need a new
baby judy has like other runs really
really worn out and then the last
present I got is just the lens that I'm
filming with right now I really don't
know how to use it it's a Canon 15
millimeter or 1.4 lines and it's not
even good for filming like can you guys
let me know or let me know what really
good ones is that you use for filming it

sorry but I literally don't really know
how to use this or what's going on so
