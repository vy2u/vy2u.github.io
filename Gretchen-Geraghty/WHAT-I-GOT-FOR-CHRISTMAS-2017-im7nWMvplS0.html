waiting for this day for a whole year
I'm just so happy to be at home with my
family this is going to be me showing
you everything that I got for Christmas
this year and I really think this is my
fourth or fifth what I got for Christmas

at years past and just see how
everything has changed
before I forget to mention everything I
can find them is helping you online I
will have link down below so it super
easy for you guys to find out what I am
so that we can't win so yeah without
further ado it let's get on into it what
I got for Christmas this year
so the first step I'm going to be
showing you is actually it from my
favorite shopping app you guys already
know it's out shopping I'm not gonna
explain it cuz I know I talked about in
every video but it just basically has
all my favorite stores on there and so
convenient and I'm obsessed with it and
I know if you use code corruption you'll
get five dollars off and free shipping
of your first order they've all my
favorite stores and they're like we're
fall orbit Outfitters Lululemon this
isn't sponsoring them or anything I'm
just literally obsessive dammit so the
first two things I got I actually
ordered Ando I got this a goalie denim
skirt because I don't have any like
plain denim skirts like this and this
time I know you can find I revolve
Bloomingdale's my best friend Avenue
guys oh we literally copy each other so
much and she had this white top it's so
beautiful it's from the brand likely it
kind of like flows out on your wrist
look at the sleeves and has a good
chilly top and then it ties in the bow
and back so I just think this is the
most perfect white blouse I'm so says
that now we're gonna match heavy males
up Steve Madden on do so I got these
black platform sneakers they're just
suede they're so cute
oh man we just got so much down here in
Albany so I cannot wait to go play in
this fella dude it's gonna be great okay
and then this stuff is also from don't
you guys might recognize for mine I was
just in Paris I took a bunch of pictures
in them these shoes are just at Vince
Camuto they're just black leather little
booties they kind of dip down lower in
the front and there's like cute little
studs all around the friend's little
edges if you can see I have these made
while jeans they just have buttons off
the front there like high-waisted and
black and I love the trend right now
jeans are really distressed on the
bottom at the ankle I think it's like so
cute looks so good with some sneakers so
I love these like high-waisted jeans
they fit me perfect so as you can know
that also I like made low on Tasha
window this black
long-sleeved blouses are Topshop kind of
look
neck and it like splits up the sleeves
it was all flowy and then this coat is
so cute guys is also from Topshop it's
this beautiful blush pink kind of pea
coat it's nice and long and cozy warm
and this blush pink little crossbody bag
is from made well it's so adorable I
didn't have very many a little bag so I
thought this would just be perfect okay
then we can move on it to what my
parents and my sister got me but Lucy
got me these vans which I was not
expecting I love when people know you
better than you know yourself like I'm
gonna be so obsessed with these and wear
them all the time because she actually
has the all-black version was like this
part and this part being black and I
would literally steal them from her and
wear them like every day in Paris so she
just caught me at the version with the
white I haven't really laced him up yet
but these are gonna be perfect I'm so
excited and they're kind of like did for
the my normal style they're like very
edgy so I'm so excited to wear these
then oh my parents I actually asked for
a couple things because I'm like 20 I am
like self-sufficient I can like buy my
own presence you know so the best
presents for me or presents that you
kind of need anyway in life you have
make sense so I literally asked for a
toothbrush toothpaste socks a little
flosser so I got some father's got a
toothbrush got some toothpaste thanks
mom and dad you're the best oh my ask
for and you do not make up remover wipes
cuz these I use like every day they're
so amazing and they get kind of pricey
and I think I'm always running out
because I use them every day so I got a
little packet to thanks mommy here are
the socks I was talking about they're
just like five little underarms I like
the big present I asked for my parents
or just these black egg slippers I think
they're so adorable I want to say the
style name it's like Coquette am I
saying that right that might be totally
wrong but they're just a nice and fluffy
and I actually got things because at my
cousin Mandy has them and I would always
steal them and wear them all is their
and I love that they have like the
really thick soles on the bottom so you
literally can wear them outside like
catch me wearing these everyday I was
like leggings in a sweatshirt I'm so
excited for these oh then I'm the worst
and like this is when people say it's so
hard to give me presents because like
anything I want I just buy so for
example I told my parents that I was
like wanting a silk robe and so my dad
got me this silk robe actually love it
though like I'll keep this and the one
that am I right now so he got me this
one it's just like this really long silk
robe kind of like kimono style and
there's just all these beautiful like
flower floral prints for the bird I'm
just
birds this is cool so I just so fun and
if I want like a long one over this one
I think on vacation like when you go to
the beach you wear this like a bikini
like as a beach cover-up or something so
I still really like this and then I got
myself some silk robe I just got this
red one from at Victoria's Secret it's
literally perfect it's like this dark
red color and I couldn't pick just one
color so I also got the black version of
this robe I love it because I love that
it cuts off like right on your elbow and
it's gonna be so perfect for getting
ready and I figured like it's my friend
to me or getting ready for like going
out or whatever they're gonna want a
silk robe - so then we can both wear one
a vo Lisa for you maybe I need to get a
third so about three of us and yeah I'm
gonna do it
what color do you guys want let me know
sex me okay finishing up the stuff my
parents taught I didn't even ask for
that thanks mom it's so cool
specifically proven neck support machine
washable it's like this travel pillow
that goes do you see the girl if she
kind of has it around her neck like that
and I'm traveling always like I
literally live on planes so thank you so

so at least this will make it more
comfortable and maybe a bit who knows

literally my favorite type of top right

different
I'm just been like getting them in the
past like month so when I was in Paris I
got this beautiful white fluffy eye that
has like two little pom-pom balls and I
know it's from a store called boys show
I don't know if it's a just in Paris or
Europe or whatever but it's like so
adorable I'll have some PJs from oyster
I got like three sets because I'm crazy
and I have like no PJs but I shouldn't
like a block or whatever there's just
like some right Christmas ones over
there there's like pink and white stripe
lines oh I showed you a choice your robe
and then also from me choice secret
I got a bras I really needed to show
just looks really pretty
purpley up bra and I went to Victoria's
Secret the day or to go and my friend
Caroline and she just got this and said
it was like the best bra in the world
and that I needed it so obviously I have
to get it I never really wear bras so
it's exciting to have a bra in case I
want to wear one you know but DNA I'm
wearing a bra right now
no it's Christmas doesn't want to show
it in the vlog from urban it like ties
right there flows out it's just
beautiful if a nanny at school actually
had an item copier because I think it's
so cute
fans are brandy melville in Paris I got
this white t-shirt just says Colorado
this reminds me of em ik Donald if you
guys know my I've got our Instagram and
YouTube videos in sup that she always
wear this shirt and it looks like so
cute and comfy so I decided I would get
it and I thought that I was gonna go to
Colorado in January which now not
anymore so I felt like I had to get it
but now I'm not even going but anyway I
just don't think it's really cute and
like it's a perfect comfy t-shirt fit
then I got with this crop little gray or
a tank top it just buttons up the front
oh my gosh I don't even know where it
went but also from the brandy melville
in Paris it was literally at this exact
style t-shirt but some Colorado is Paris
and there's like a Paris flag you might
have seen at my blog but yeah I think
you do be good to get a pair of shirt
okay oh my god I haven't used my mic
this entire time I've been filming I'm
so mad at myself
Gretchen is literally sitting right over
there the audio isn't gonna be as good
as I hoped I'm really upset right now
I'm really sorry that my mic hasn't been
going on it's probably a clicky for my
lens just like I got them like I'm using
the like oh it's so sad okay I really
hope that the click enos of the
autofocus on the lens is it bothering
you guys ping it lightly the rest of the
stuff I'm gonna show you guys is from
subdued it's actually at this store I
know in America they only have one
location in LA but they have one in
Paris as well and I got this beautiful
like white sweater
sweatshirt and it just has navy blue and
pink like stripes on the sleeves like
that and I love it because it is so
furry and soft and I also got this red
kind of cropped sweater I love the fit
of this I just think
so cute it's like long-sleeve and that's
in front of it and then I got this red
this is a corduroy scherzo decoy
yeah quarter I think it's corduroy it
kind of just like ramped up and down in
like soft material but wait there's more
I forgot there's a couple more things in
this bag it's a bunch of stuff that I
just got from like Sephora and such and
this bag I bought really recently I
guess I wouldn't say this is what I got
for Christmas but I bought it for myself
really recently it's just like the Louie
Vuitton 55 duffel bag I'm obsessed with
it and Maggie had and she was like you
need to get it and then you guys know
this gold cardi bracelet I just bought
in Paris so that might be I'll say
whatever Christmas is like guys oh yeah
I guess I'll just show you this nice
Tiffany ring I got in Paris last when I
was there for Thanksgiving and I got so
many questions about it it's just the
silver one from Tiffany it's the classic
like T ring that's that and then that's
cool cardio brace oh I just got I just
got my nails done wait they're actually
my real nails they're like a and C I
would definitely recommend a and C
because I'm obsessed with them anyway
oh wait this was from my dad I like all
out of sorts now but I know you couldn't
find this actually I don't have this for
I know they only have it at Alta it's a
heart-shaped tape concealer and I got it
in the shade light I've been wanting to
try this concealer for so long and I got
myself the Dior air flash foundation and
the way I sell the shock mascara because
I've been wanting to try these out these
are just from Sephora oh wait this is
for mommy I'm like missing all these
things I forgot to show you guys from
parents this is the Kiehl's Sun free
self tanning formula and fun fact I have
never used self-tanner
but I really want to try this because
Maggie always self-tans and she just
looks like a beautiful bronze goddess
and I'm like so pale same over here and
the other day when Mara SoulCycle of
women was like it's hard to interrupt
but I heard you guys talking about self
tanner and I use the Kiehl's self tanner
and it's like the best thing in the
world like you need to try it so since
you said that I just was inspired and
really wanted to try a self tanner for
the first time so we will see how this
goes
I'm really worried I have gotten spray
tans where you go to the place and they
spray you but I've never used like a
self-tanner cuz everybody's been to more
time turn out with orange food then also
from Sephora I got the fresh rose floral
a toner is also inspired by Maggie cuz
she had it and guys look at this
it's just like so great it's so cooling
and just like smells like roses it's so
good I like this a lot more than the
mark
c'mon Maggie told me that I would and I
do it's way better a little pricey but
very worth it well then I got myself
this sure I bar I think it took a wet
brush because I've always had the pink
wet brush but it's getting really old
and I actually lost it when I was in
Paris so good thing I got this one it's
just the yellow tribe are mine I'm
obsessed with Drive are you guys know
it's not really happy that I see a
little brush now that reminds me of them
Oh also from Sephora I got this YSL
lipstick in the shade 10 Rouge pur
Couture I don't know what I'm saying but
it just like this pinky nude I'm excited
to try this out I don't know you know
why I like at all so I'm going to say
the trap and out all the room Sephora I
just got the dry bar detox dry shampoo
because if you guys know me you know
this is my favorite - Ian - it smells so
good I would really really really
recommend if you have blonde hair
because if you spread on your roots and
makes them look like really white and
bright if you have found out I don't
know if I recommend because it might
make your hair look a little bit like
whitish gray is should I'm blonde it's
perfect and it smells so good and I like
the original scent the best by the way
and also from Sephora I got this
Brazilian bumbum cream I actually had
tried a little small travel version of
it and I was obsessed with it so I'm
really happy I got the big one oh baby
oh my god guys it smells so good I
remember my roommate in my suite last
year I was actually talking about it and
she said that it's supposed to be like
firming for like your butt and your
boobs or whatever that's like up bum bum
cream but I have used it for a while and
I haven't noticed any like firming it
doesn't really do anything it just is
like lotion that's really thick and
moisturizing and smells really good it
says fast absorbing body cream helps
tighten and smooth like no other I don't
think it tightens earthman's but it just
smells really good in my opinion then I
got a couple things from soap &amp;amp; Glory
I'm obsessive them I have to clean on me
soaking glory
body wash is me really good for you know
showering and it smells really nice too
then I got the soapy Laurie righteous
butter I've heard so much about this
everyone's obsessed with this body cream
so I'm really excited to try this out as
well
oh yeah I love the smell of soap &amp;amp; Glory
stuff it smells just like hands food I
just got a little one of this because I
love throwing this like in my purse my
bad I think I've showed this for like
years but this is like my go-to hand
moisturizer it's so great guys and I got
the scrub of your life ultimate super
smoothing body buffer Baba is just like
a body scrub
so this would be really good I don't
really get to like exfoliate before you
like shave your likes or anything like
that so yeah this be nice okay this is
actually the end now I promise the last
two things like ah I ordered from a
glassy eye because I like some cheek
Timms from them I had a brow gel that I
really like and I just heard such
amazing things about their gloss so I've
been wanting to try their gloss for so
long it's just the clear transparent
gloss and guys literally it's so glassy
and perfect oh yeah and the very last
thing I got is just this boy brow tinted
brow gel cuz I had a clear one before
but I wanted to get the one in brown
