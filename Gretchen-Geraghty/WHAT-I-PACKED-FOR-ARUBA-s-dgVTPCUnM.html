excited to spend the New Year's there

getaway lay on the beach also I want to
mention before I start filming that I
have an insane amount of bathing suits
and I mean with me like more than any
one person should ever have however we
will be on the beach like every single
day and I'll probably be in a bikini
more than I am in normal clothes so I
hope that justifies how many businesses

comfortable and just like nice to wear
on the beach and stuff they're just like
you know the long-sleeve ones that have
like the patterned elephants on the back
I just grabbed this one hat it's just
this pink one from polo and when Justin
was helping me pack he's like don't
bring it I have a feeling you're getting
one for Christmas so I might not
actually have to bring that one and then
right here I just have like a pile of
sports bras for and I will be working
out and I think they're actually all
from Lululemon
here's this one this one this one but

obsessed with them just like the best
man text workout in ever in may little
pockets I just love them and then I have
the same pair but in this cool like
pattern that I just have these white
Nike running shorts I have to be careful
with what I wear underneath of them
because they're kind of see-through and
I just have these black Nike running
shorts then I just have these black
Lululemon spandex and the same black
pair of blue lemon spandex but they have
a cool pattern right there then right
here I just have two pairs of sleep
shorts and also I think I should mention
when we're there I think we have access
to a washer and dryer so I'm planning on
like
watching my clothes halfway through but
some things like I know I just want to
bring a lot of like dresses and rompers
like I'm not going to wash and wear
again because I wanted to like be able
to wear a bunch of the difference I had
and right here we have workout tank jobs
I just have this white one from
Lululemon I've got this light purpley
pink one from the lemon this purple one
from Lululemon this coral under
Lululemon this grey one from Lululemon
and this oh yeah black one from
Lululemon then right here I have what
I'm going to be wearing on the plane I
just have a Boston University sweatshirt
I have white converse I have the short
sleeve purple shirt from Lululemon and
just these a black speed tight pants
from 11 these are like my favorite type
of leggings they have then I'm bringing
one sweater type thing for if it's
colder at night and if I just want to
like throw it over things this is just a
big huge like holy tan cardigan from
brandy melville I'm sure if you've
watched my videos for a while you've
seen this before because it's just so
comfortable and I feel like I used to
wear it with like everything then I'm
reading one pair of jeans in case it's
kind of chilly at night and then I'm
bringing one pair of robo's sweatpants
in case it's also cold at nighttime and
if I just want to be comfy this is kind
of funny then I'm bringing a swim cap
goggles and a sewing bathing suit I used
to be a swimmer fun fact but I'm
bringing those because I'm not even
kidding I wanna be able to race Justin
in the pool because we always have races
and he thinks he's faster than me but
he's not because I used to swim okay and
these are all the tops I'm bringing I'm
bringing this white top from brandy
melville it just has those crisscross
e-type things right there I'm bringing
this pattern shirt from Abercrombie &amp;amp;
Fitch I'm wringing this navy blue tank
top from Abercrombie any of the stuff is
getting dirty because it's like on my
ground but this first weight tank type I
just showed you this is the same one

I'm bringing this forest green v-neck
shirt from pink and I have the same one
in white and this is just like a black
slouchy like really soft black shirt
from brandy melville and here is a white
kind of like crinkly shirt from rain

recently and I really like it and then I
found this little gem in my closet here
I didn't even bring it to college but
it's just this navy blue tank top that's
lacy and has all these ruffles and it's
from Abercrombie &amp;amp; Fitch and here's some
t-shirts I brought I just have this
Boston University one
and then I have this long-sleeve white
one from brandy melville that again like
if it gets a little bit colder I can
wear this so I want to have like one
kind of more nicer like normal
long-sleeve playing shirt
rather than those like ivory yellow ones
and then I don't know if this is weird
to show but I'm actually not bringing
that many bras because I think you're
most of the time I'll be wearing bathing
suits so yeah here just the brows and
bringing I might put in like one or two
more like the one I'm wearing right now
probably and then I just have this
little set of brown underwear and then
there's my undies right there now I
guess we have to dress this whole mess
of bathing suits I just have a plain
black top inglis you got this from back
then so I decided that would be good
with all the other ones I have in case I
just need a plain black like string top
I guess starting from down here I just
decided I should bring all my triangle
ones so I have eleven triangle bikinis
and I did not buy all of them some of
them were sent to me I love you guys at
triangle at my if you're watching this
but I'm bringing this like coral and
orange one I just like lined up all the

top with blue bottoms I this top with
blue bottoms I have this yellow in white
and pink like perforated top with just
yellow and pink bottoms I have some teal
bottoms that go with this I really like

these pink bottoms with a black outline
that go with these then I have this
black leather one that goes with those
bottoms and I have these bottoms that go
with this top and so far that is all I'm
getting another one in the mail I'm so
sad I think it comes today after I leave
so I don't know what I'm going to do
that one is just like a white top with
navy blue flower bottoms update I know
this is way later and not when I was
filming earlier but I've just said that
I didn't think my other triangle bathing
suit come in time and look what just
came in the mail I can't believe it
because I'm pretty sure it was scheduled
to come the day after I leave so I was
like oh look I'm not gonna have an Aruba
and the FedEx guy just came and I was
like oh my gosh so I thought I should
just show you right now the one that I
was talking about
I'm bring this little guy to Aruba -
this is what it looks like it's just the
white top like this and then some navy
blue bottoms like this so it's difficuit
and I'm really happy came in time for me
to bring it all of these are just like a
Victoria's Secret bathing suits because
I used to just wear those before I got
into like the triangle ones and I have
these two tops they're actually the same
one but in different colors I have a
bunch of these like cheeky bottoms but I
don't actually know if I'm gonna be
wearing them that much because I'm gonna
be with like Justin's family but I
brought them in case like I'm tanning
because they're good for tanning and
this top I love and then I have like
this little matching set I have a bunch
of tops in this style if you guys watch
my bikini collection from like a summer
to ago like I just have like all of
these ones so I just brought a couple of
those like this purple one is for a blue
one this white one I wear a bunch
because it just goes everything oh my
gosh I forgot I got this lemon bathing
suit I haven't worn it yet so I'm really
excited to wear this that I have this
Midori bikini which I'm really excited
to wear and this top is just like the
mint green one with some straps on the
back and it's like the more cheeky type
bottom and then over here I just have
some more Victoria's Secret ones I have
these bottoms oh I really like these
these ones are just like the roughly
ones I think they're really cute then I
just have some plain black bottoms from
Victoria's Secret this I remember I got
like in the winter on super sale it kind
of looks like the triangle one I got and
these two just go together oh and then
these bottoms I love - they're like
royal blue from Victoria's Secret and I
thought I could just pair it with some
white tops like I have this white
bandeau top from Victoria's Secret and
it has all the fringe
oh yeah member said I have a bunch of
those like cheeky bottoms I mean they're
called the it C bottom a Victoria Secret
if you're interested but I just had them
in pink I have them and why I also have
them like in this color in this color
um I think I'm working the black ones -
they're like buried in here somewhere
in case I wanted more conservative
bottoms I grabbed these just plain white
lace ones from Victoria's Secret that
are more like full coverage in the back
these ones are from adore me of this
online website they're just like tio and
white they're really cute and then I
just have this plain a black top from
Victoria's Secret which is really good
for tanning and

so that is like the clothes and the
bathing suits that I am bringing to

other stuff that I know I'm going to
bring to so here I just have my black
fossil wristlet which I know will be
good to carry around sometimes I use
this like Louis Vuitton one that Justin
got me but that one isn't a wristlet so
I thought this would be good for when
we're like going around I'll have like
this strap to hold in my hand not really
sure if I'm gonna bring my like big like
DSLR camera this is the Canon Rebel t3i
if you guys didn't know but I'm not sure
if I'm gonna bring this one yet because
Justin's mom Allison has like a really
nice big camera I think she's like a
Nikon one so you might just like use
that for pictures I'm a hundred percent
bringing this bad boy though this is the
canon powershot g7x that I use for
vlogging and sometimes filming you guys
are telling you has like even better
qualities in my DSLR camera so

open them up a bunch of you to ask to
where they're from and they are from Liz
