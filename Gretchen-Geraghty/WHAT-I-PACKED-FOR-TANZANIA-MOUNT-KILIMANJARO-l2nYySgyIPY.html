you've been keeping up with me I'm
actually traveling to Tanzania today I'm
leaving tonight it's so crazy that it's
ready here because I've been fundraising
since like October and just anticipating
the trips anyway this video as you can
tell by the title is just going to be
wired bringing to Africa and
specifically to hike Mount Kilimanjaro
and then I'm staying on the extended
trip that we're doing it's like twelve
of us that are going from beyou and then
I know there's some kids from Yukon and
Penn State as well I think that are
going to be hiking with us but yeah I've
just been preparing so much stuff for a
while now because you have to be very
particular with what you're going to
bring because about Kilimanjaro you go
through all five ecosystems so the
bottom it's like 90 degrees Fahrenheit
like really hot like summer Africa
weather and then the very top is like
negative 20 like Arctic like so cold so
you just have to be like really prepared
and then I'm staying on the extended
trip like I said so that's like a week
long after in Zanzibar
so obviously that can be really tropical
and really hot and I need like bathing
suits for that so I literally have
everything from like winter coats snow
pants boots all the way to bathing suits
so yeah without further ado let's get on
it to it okay so the first things I'm
going to be showing you are just visa
compression legging in these luckily I
had it back from when I was rowing last
year and living rowing team at bu and we
just wore the conversion pants a lot and
these are so good especially if you're
traveling they just make your legs like
less solar and for me like when I'm
recovering from running in stuff these
just I notice help a lot and I used to
use the two XE ones with these cwx ones
or cheaper and better light pack
definitely go check them I think I just
got the money Amazon I'll let them down
below I can find them but you can see
they just have all these different like
I don't even know like sections that are
made specifically to help your muscles
and everything so since it's going to be
like two flights there and it's gonna
take like two days to get there these
I'm going to wear I'm playing and then
also I'm learning this like in my pack
so we had to get one of the like 80
liter huge pass so that's one thing I
got used to Mountain Sports and I
literally lived at Eastern Mountain
Sports of these past couple weeks I just
kept going to pick up more stuff I'll
also like hiking these two then I just
have these like snow cans
I'm actually born from Taylor when
you're watching the Taylor hi Thank You
webview because I didn't really have
like snow pants but these are just like
North Face these are going to be really
really good I just saw like waterproof
obviously and I'm like warm on the
inside so definitely need these and
everyone says the trick for Kilimanjaro
is really just layering it up so I have
like so many layers and all this time
I'm going to be showing you two is like
recommended from this list that the
people that were going with that are
like leading the trek they like gave us
this list of stuff to bring on also just
so you know we're going with choose a
challenge which is like a uk-based
company and they lead a bunch of
different like treks across different
now ends I think like around the world
so Kilimanjaro they said is like the
hardest one but I'll be okay these are
definitely the most important you need
to get like really good hiking shoes and
I didn't have any because I literally
like don't like so this is going to be a
really new good experience for me but I
just got these grind penguins from
eastern mountain sports I just had the
lady help me I was like listen figured
out Kilimanjaro I'm really not an
experienced hiker at all and these are
just really comfortable and I've been
wearing them like every day the past two
weeks to help break them in and then
they recommended that you brought a
thick fleece in a thin fleece to just
like lay up under your jackets and this
I'm considered like a thin please
because I don't really have a thin
fleece so I just follow this like
pullover Pru neck ones and these crew
neck sweatshirts are like my favorite to
wear anyway and then my thick fleece
I'll show you is a padded one you want
to look at the bottom and then they said
a couple long-sleeve a couple short
sleeves and like the drive fit ones I
think are better because they're lighter
and like breathable not cotton that can
be like heavy so I just brought this
Lululemon drived it one I always wear
this one running this is my
I'm bringing each of this Northface one
and it's so fuzzy on the inside and then
I was gonna wear do you guys know my mom
had Adonia blast like puffy coat I was
gonna bring that my dad was I got to
know like first of all it's kind of old
in the padding's kind of worn out so
it's not even really that more many more
and he was like Gretchen look you need
to get a really good one like you don't
realize I kept like so cold at the top
but get one that you can read about
online my people say it's good for like
hiking about Coleman jar oh and also my
long Patagonia coat literally goes to my
knees so they kind of be hard to like
walk up a mountain in you know I got
Wanda short one so I found this one it
is the nut C jacket in black and I just
found this on Amazon too if I can find
it down below and I think they were sold
out on a small when I tried to order it
so I got a medium and it's like so big
on me but that'll be okay because I can
like layer a bunch of stuff underneath
it but I don't know if you can see it's
like really really wide it's like very
very padded and fluffy and will
hopefully keep me warm up top because I
read a bunch reviews and people said
that this was like really good socks are
very important to with your head
features I hope is everyone tells me
they are so I had to get a bunch of me
saw so they were telling me Eastern
Mountain Sports that smart wolves like
the way to go so I just got a bunch of
these like smart wool hiking socks and
obviously like taller ones are better so
you don't get blisters or anything like
they don't recommend you bring like
ankle socks there were parodies that's
why it's unwrapped then I got these
smart wool mountaineering one no these
are like the thickest socks we have so
hopefully I can like sleep at night and
then like I don't know if you can tell
these are like the biggest thing ever so
that'll be good on like some at night
I'm so nervous for her to sum it like
it's gonna be so cold
then they recommended that you bring
like a thin pair of gloves in a stick
pair so I just got these ones from
Dick's they're like I think we're just
like running like fin ones but they're
kind of like furries you can see so
these I feel like we'll be good thin
ones and then I already has these like
snow like
and you know and I figured like worse
comes to worse if it's like really cold
I can wear these under these so yeah
here's some more smart while hiking
sausage' college so many of those I got
a headlamp because they recommended that
you get a headlamp which is so crazy me
but like on seven night I know we go to
bed really early like 6 or 7 p.m. and we
literally get up at midnight hike for
the first like 5 hours in the dark and
then hike the whole rested and age like
reach the summit so this is gonna come
in handy I know everyone says that's
like essential I found this thing at
Eastern Mountain Sports it's like the
Nano PAC towel and it's just like mini
little package but it apparently is like
a towel that's like it's 19 by 19 so
that gets pretty big that'll be good to
like I don't know towel off my face it's
really stressing me out I can't shower
for a week or like makeup or anything
but it's right then I just got these
bath boys because I was a noose around
sort of a be she's a Gretchen you need
these like you're not Camila shower for
a week isn't really gonna save you so
yeah hopefully those work out well and I
just have this derma rest that they
recommend to the eastern mountain sports
and basically this just goes underneath
your sleeping bag so that when it's
really cold it kind of like lifts you
off the ground for the coldness of the
ground like get into your sleeping bag
of that make sense and would make you
colder and the same goes for like when
the ground is really hot you inflate it
a little bit and there's like some foam
in there and like probably it'll make it
a little more comfortable too and also
just you know I'm ready to get sleeping
that when I get there because like
bringing one over would be like really
hard you know because they're so big and
they have like good ones that they have
like for like sub-zero temperatures so
I'm just gonna write one of those and
then I recommend it
good sunglasses so luckily I have my
Oakley's back from when I was growing
and yeah super fresh and then they said
bring like a Sun Hat like a baseball cap
I think that's what that means so I'm
just grabbing this Red Sox wine that I'm
doing at this white north face rinku for
when it rains and then first scarf I'm
just bringing this little eleven ones in
oh my gosh I'm reading so much gray 14
top I'm just playing this little lemon
gray one just this black one as well I'm
bringing two lemon black sports bras
this is just that like cool kg looking
one and this is just the Y one and then
I already showed you the other little
one my mom sleep grey shirt and then
this is just another long season
bringing it's just like a peso anymore
and for a short sleeve shirt I just grab
this gray and then this I know some of
these are cotton but like to me Cotton's
way more comfortable so I don't know I
just kind of brought a Mick for shorts I
just brought these black blue lemon
spandex and then these black Nike little
dry fit sure this was that thicker how
to go to your place I was telling you
guys about
I don't think told us to bring these I
feel get night owl monkeys I just grab
these Nike Pro black sweatpants I have
so they're like really warm on the
inside and then they said we should
bring a lightweight trekking pants so I
just grabbed these lemon ones I
they're like lightly and then for the
summit they gave us these shirts for the
b-positive foundation and if I didn't
mention it in this video I mentioned it
in other ones so half of the money we
fundraise for hiking actual Mongiardo is
going to the B+ foundation and that
makes you so excited because basically
if they donate to families with kids
with childhood cancer and then they also
just donate to research for childhood
cancer and just knowing that we're
donating to them like just makes me feel
so much better and we met with Carly who
works at the b-positive foundation and
she's telling us like all the families
we've helped and I don't know it just
makes it like so much better that we're
doing this for a cause as well so
everyone on the trip is just gonna bring
it there
b-positive shirt oh and then these
leggings were going to be a really good
cheese or just black Lululemon leggings
I don't know if they sell them anymore
but I remember that they are called at
the toasty tektites because they're
really thick and basically why they're
awesome is a hole inside is like soft
and furry they have a little pockets on
the side too so these are going to be
really good when it gets cold well and
this is what my huge bag looks like by
the way I wouldn't empty luckily we
actually don't have to carry these via
Sherpa that are like really experienced
climbers going up the mountain with us
so they carry those we just carry our
smaller little day packs and I'm just
bringing a small little Patagonia
backpack for like what I'm bringing
during the day I have some like
electronic stuff that I gotta bring so
I'm gonna bring my camera that I'm
filming with right now just my vlogging
camera it's the canon g7x and this is
the charger for an extra battery so that
let me get that I have two batteries to
vlog like twice as much when I'm on the
mountain you know so I plan on involving
the whole time then is a little Kate
Spade portable charger for my phone
someone on my phone I'm not giving my
computer and then I have some earphones
and then my dad got me this solar
charger on Amazon so hopefully this
works and that would be really cool
because then I have like another power
bank that gets charged in the Sun and
then for the extended trip the plugs are
different in the hotel then like
American plugs so I just had this huge
like all this converter stuff I think
got more than he needed to because it
looks like really intense like there's a
bunch of different plugs but yeah
hopefully this allows me to like charge
my phone and do stuff like that at the
hotel oh then I'm a trip also this is
really important sunscreen is definitely
must-have because at the bottom it's
like really hot and even towards the top
to you just because it's sounding so
strong you know and then I got some bug
spray because you don't want to get
malaria oh and speaking of malaria okay
let's move on to my toiletries so this
is definitely the hardest for me to not
bring like all of my makeup but I'm
getting inside I just have this little
thing from my toiletries I have shampoo
I have conditioner lotion deodorant body
wash chapstick toothpaste old toothbrush
tweezers I have an eyelash comb because
I need to comb my eyelash extensions of
course and yeah actually I don't even
know see some of this might just be for
the excited trip so basically we're
bringing like another bag that we just
leave out like a hotel for the extended
trip that we don't like bring up on the
mountain with us probably a lot of this
I'll just leave in there because like we
can't shower the whole week we're on the
bow in any way and I think we go like
five or six days up and like two days
down because obviously it's like harder
to go up and you have to go really slow
because of the altitude and like kids
can get sickness and everything but
these are just like the toiletries I'm
bringing and some didn't fit in there
like okay this looks really sketchy but
I just brought the red looking ones are
ibuprofen and the white ones are just
vitamin C because those are just two
medicines I wanted to bring and then
here my malaria pills like I was telling
you guys so still want to get malaria
definitely take malaria pills if you
were to go to Africa and then they
recommended we bring like next to give
you a lot of energy so I grab these
little cashews and my mom went kami got
me so many Clif Bar thanks mom so I have
a whole pack of these like peanut butter
Clif bars and then I have some chocolate
chip one then she also got another pack
of water bars and my favorite kind
between
so I have a bunch of those I don't know
if I'm gonna bring like all of these
this is a lot but we'll see oh and also
like all the stuff I'm showing you I
haven't really fit it all into this bag
yet
hopefully it fits what if it doesn't I
guess I'm not bringing some of it then
I'm really really scared of being cold I
don't like being cold at all and at the
top I just don't want to freeze so you
might think I'm crazy but I ordered um
40 packs of hand warmers on Amazon and
this is just 20 because I know I don't
be crazy so I think I'm just gonna bring
20 packs and dormers hopefully you know
fit all in and I'm bringing this
sunscreen for my face it's a Hawaiian
Tropic weightless face sunscreen you
guys know I posted on Instagram with
them I love working with them because I
love this stuff or feels of like a
lotion on your face you know so this is
good to have then my hairdresser Jill hi
I love you she gave me this mini little
dry shampoo I just got my hair done like
two days ago telling her I was going to
ask and I couldn't like shower for we
got anything and she's like oh my god
you need this like so your hair doesn't
look like gross sound like the seventh
day or whatever so she gave me this
little mini dry shampoo and I tried out
smells so good oh my gosh
it's the Amika perkupp dry shampoo so
love that stuff and then I have this
mini wet brush like how perfect I really
hope all this stuff fits because now I'm
getting rid of it it's not all they said
to bring a razor to so maybe you can see
I don't initiate my legs for a week I'll
be fun and then this is really
contingent on everything else fitting
okay so I know I can't really like bring
makeup or anything but I grabbed this
mini little NARS thing because I feel
like if I could bring anything I could
bring this you know it's just like
bronzer and blush because I'll just like
feel better about myself I can put on
bronzer and blush and then I found this
little mini kabuki brush and then like I
don't want to not have eyebrows well in
there
so I try to sneak these and smell I
don't know how I'm gonna really put it
on but we'll see if that works then I
just have these makeup removing wipes so
that I can take off that bronzer and I
have some acute tips and I have my
passport with my visa
finally a came thank God it like almost
any common time I was crying so worried
out of this bad to show basically that's
what these looks like they put it in
your passport getting close to the end
here I just had these sneakers one bring
- these are like my running song me
sneakers oh my gosh I they say that
wrong is almost on the other hand Sam
but I'm just gonna bring these feel like
camp sites I'm at night so I'm learning
right now I'm gonna bring my rainbows
again for like camp sites when we're
like in for the night I just want like
walk around in them at the bottom it's
gonna be really hot and then for the
extended trip I might need to grab a few
more things but basically it's just like
a week like on the beach and stuff so I
don't really need that much I might just
bring this white tank top that I'm
wearing I grab this gray one from Brandi
I grab these black shorts from Brandi
these were like you want me shorts I
wherever I grab these leggings from
Lululemon I was going to breeze on the
trek up but then I had two other one so
I'm like pick I don't really need more
than two these are just like a
high-waisted ones in case it's like
colder and probably cuz my other two
light things will be really dirty after
a week of hiking back down Majuro so I
want another pair and then I just
brought one dress because I said this
one's really versatile like you guys
like maybe to cover up as it can be
casual or I can like dressed a lot more
for you like do anything fancy which we
probably won't but I don't know wait
some of these have to go on my other
main pack - it's like lots of undies
obviously some more socks okay and then
bathing - you guys are neat so proud of
me I only brought two and a half dating
suit and I literally obviously want to
bring like 30 I just brought this one
from you toys secret it's like this teal
color and then I just brought this
maroon one from is awful I love this one
it's so cute and then this white topics
from is awful as well just in case I
want to stress like Oh No
then I just grabbed this white
long-sleeve shirt from brandy it's
really stretchy and comfy in some fuzzy
socks I visit gray a little hoodie from
brandy chilly at night and then I have
these ray-ban my black ones with gold
and then I brought this one little
perfume because I'm obviously not going
to bring perfume like going up on a trek
but this is just little Katie's room
Stepford with the perfume on inside I
forget what it's called Ellen said the
name right here it's like what Han I use
it until I copied her and I love it it's
like some of my favorite perfume or so
long so yeah I think that is everything
I am bringing to a good tight Malkiel
Manjaro
and i think this video is actually gonna
go up to like WOM hiking because I want
to schedule it so that I don't not have
videos for like three weeks no names you
guys have a hike Mount Kilimanjaro or
gone to Africa before comment down below
and tell me where and like when you went
up because I feel like that's just so
interesting and I feel like what's
really weird as I haven't even been to
like gear up but here I am going to
Africa so I don't know I'm really
excited and uh also I'm gonna mention I
didn't even tell you guys so I have the
malaria pills and I've seen other I'm
covered you're going to be safe and
maybe for your information - if you're
planning on going I got my Hep A Shau
