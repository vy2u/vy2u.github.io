Christmas wish list video and this video
has been so requested it was one of the
top comments on one of my recent videos
and I realized I tend to blab on forever
at the beginning my video so we're just
gonna get right on into it so the first
thing in my Christmas wish list is just
a black Patagonia pea coat because I
have it black Patagonia pico and I was
wearing it like a week ago and I lost it
I have no idea where it is like I can't
find it before I go any further let me
mention I know all the things on my
Christmas wishlist video you can
actually find on the dote shopping app
and you guys know how obsessed I am with
though like I feel like I don't even
need to explain anymore because I pretty
much talked about in every single haul
video of mine I love it that much for
shopping addicts like me it is like a
dream come true
dough actually just released a new
feature called lists so you can make
like your favorite lists of items
everything I'm gonna be talking about
you can just go on my list and like
everything will be there like the links
and the stores are from so it's like so
helpful and I'll have it linked down
below it's moving on to my second item
the second item I have on my Christmas
wish list it's just a little lemonade
yoga mat and I was surprised that they
had this on here because I know don't
usually has like clothing shoes makeup
but I found the black yoga mat I want to
just go in through dough I literally
scroll through there like aimlessly all
the time just finding new things that I
need to buy so dangerous so could be I
really just wanted this black and yoga
mat from the lemon because I thought it
would be a good time to get a new like
nicer quality one because I've been
doing hot yoga for so long like I just
love how yoga makes me feel so good guys
if you haven't done it you should try it
but the yoga mat I have is just super
old and worn out so I thought it would
be a good time at to get a new one and
the third thing on my Christmas wishlist
is just some at Victoria's Secret
pajamas and I'm a little bit salty about
this because actually about a dark pink
and light pink stripe long sleeves
pajamas from Victoria's Secret like not
that long ago like a month ago and I
thought they were the silky ones but
they're actually this cotton material
there's like sparkly threads in them and
they drive me nuts because they look H
my skin I don't know I'm just like crazy
so I actually found this lucky ones this
time and those are the ones that are on
my Christmas wish list hopefully I get
them Santa if you're listening please I
don't want pajamas that make my skin
itch the fourth thing on my Christmas
wishlist is there some pearls from
forever 21 because if you guys know come
on those of you that know me you know I
literally never take at my pearl
earrings and I wish I could be the type
of person to get like nice like real
ones but I know I'll just lose them I
tried to get real ones once I lost all
of them in like a month so we're not
going there again I just
take ones from forever21 and they're
fine like these are from forever21 the
fifth thing I have in my Christmas
specialist is funny this is something
that my family actually gets mad at me
about like when it's like my birthday or
Christmas coming up and they know of
stuff that I want I'm like the worst and
I always just buy it for myself
supporting because I can't like wait so
this is an example of that this fresh
face mask from Sephora it's like the
brand fresh it's like the black tea
instant perfecting mask and I cut it way
and I just got it awesome don't the
other day actually I ordered it on there
because I was looking at it and I was
like I want it now and really the reason
I got this like let's be real do you
guys know Claudia so whiskey like
another youtuber I haven't seen her
videos and so on but I used to be like
obsessed with their videos like I love
her get caught about her videos the
other day and she was talking out this
fresh black tea instant perfecting mask
in like a favorites video I think it was
and she said that it was like amazing
and literally like the best face mask
ever so I was like I need it so
hopefully I will like it because it's
pretty expensive but Claudia said that I
needed it so I got it so the sixth thing
I put on my Christmas wish list the
first aid beauty moisturizer from
Sephora you guys know it comes in like
actually I think it comes in like
squeezy tubes to you I used to get the
one like in the tub and it's such an
amazing moisturizer I haven't had it in
so long
my skin has been getting so dry if I
nose literally keeps peeling because
like it's getting colder you know so the
second thing I put on here it's just
this gray jacket from Nordstrom when I
was in LA with Tasha we were both trying
on these jackets and we like loved them
and I believe it's from the brand Blanc
NYC is that what it's called but it's on
my profile window like in the Christmas
at wishlist section so you can just see
it on there a thing I have in my
Christmas wish list are just these at
Topshop jeans because I'm wanting
Topshop jeans for literally my whole
life I feel like I've never had a pair
so I just want like the black ones with
like this little minis because I feel
like everyone has those they're just so
cute
ix thing I have is just to make up
forevers matte foundation because
although my skin gets dry in the winter
it tends to get very oily so I really
like using mattifying products on my
skin I always try to get like a
mattifying foundations and I really want
to try this one out and then the tenth
thing last but not least is the benefit
hoola bronzer because that is just a
go-to in mine you know I'm gonna get it
right now off of that you can tell it's
old because it's like the old packaging
where you just pull this off instead of
like flip it up make it seriously so old
and look at it guys there's like none
left like oh my gosh so I just really
need a new one of these and it's like
the perfect bronzer like I think it's so
good for contouring I just love it it's
not like muddy and I like that it's not
too warm too
don't look orange so that is everything
on my Christmas wish list this year guys
if I think of other things I might add
them to it you guys enjoy because this
video it's like really requested I was
surprised how many people asked for it
