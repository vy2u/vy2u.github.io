video that I've gotten so so many
questions about and I know it's a little
bit weird a little bit different I've
never really made a video like this I
know I feel a little like uncomfortable
for some people but I just decided you
know what guys we're all friends here
and I've been making youtube videos for
a while a lot of you have been watching
me for a while I feel like we've had
very close relationship so I decided to
just why not just like give you the
truth and let it all out I've gotten so
so many comments just about okay what
brawls do you wear what bras are you
wearing so that you can't see them when
you wear like really low-cut stuff like
this or like open back stuff like this
since I've been making YouTube videos
like four years ago there's always been
questions what bras room and Gretchen
are you wearing one at all a lot of you
are saying like no she's really flat
obviously like super flat I guess my
opinion really isn't applicable for
those of you that has really big boobs
because I clearly have not been blessed
in that area however a lot of you are
still interested in what I do where to
not show my bra when I'm wearing low-cut
stuff and open-back stuff and share
stuff in white shirts so a lot of the
times I've noticed that your questions
are simply answered with a nude bra and
I'm not gonna lie pretty much all the
bras I own are nude I grabbed a bunch to
show you I just decided you know like
why not just get all ten ones so that I
can wear like all of them all the time
you know what I'm saying because if I
get like a red wine I'm not gonna be
able wear under a white shirt so my
first tip would just be like get a tan
nude colored bra because that will solve
a lot of your problems when you're just
writing like white or sheer shirts
if you wearing a nude colored bra you
won't be able to see it if you wear like
a white one under a white shirt you'll
still be able to see it so just get like
a skin colored bra and you won't see it
works like a charm my next tip would be
if you still can see your bra it's
probably because it's like this sort of
situation where you'll be able to see
the straps so you're gonna want to get a
strapless bra I grabbed this strapless
bra this is just from Victoria's Secret
and all these bras I grabbed to show you
how some push up in them because like I
said I have no boobs so I need all the
help I can get I think this is just
there like where everywhere everyday
like a strapless push-up bra and then I
also have it in the like fare every day
I think that's what it's called
it's just Han a little bit of pushup
same thing and these ones I notice are a
little bit lighter than these ones from
Aries so I kind of prefer the ones from
Airy because they're a little bit dark
like match my skin tone so that I really
don't notice them under white shirts you
know I'm saying and this one's just like
a darker tan strapless one from Erie and
this is just a darker tan one with
straps for Mary
like I said tip number one just get a
nude bra it will solve a lot of your
problems and then if that still isn't
working mostly I can just get away with
a strapless nude bra for most shirts
sometimes you can like pull down the
back of the bra a little bit more so
that even open back stuff you still
won't see it but if you have something
that's very revealing for example like
this or something that's really really
deep in the back you're gonna need some
sticky boob pads and I didn't get some
of these until public a year ago and I
didn't even know what they were and I
thought they were kind of weird at first
but basically okay well I'm wearing mine
right now but basically they allow you
to wear tops like this that go really
deep because you can like separate them
or if a top is like maybe really open on
the sides lower than that you'd be able
to see like your strapless bra and they
have like a little hook in between and
you just put it like right here it just
goes on the front so what the sides in
the back is just all free you know I'm
just gonna take them off right now and
just be like braless the rest of the
video so that you can see all right ever
change them so these little guys are
just from Erie and I really recommend
these these are the only ones I've ever
tried out but they work really well
they're just sticky on the inside and
you just stick them wet right like that
if you can see you hook them right there
in the middle you just go like that
actually I think you're supposed to
stick them on your boobs first and then
you hook it so that it kind of like
pulls your boobs together but um doesn't
really work for me anyway because like
I've no boobs like it like doesn't
really do anything I know this was kind
of simple and probably common sense but
you guys wouldn't believe like the
amount of requests I get for like oh my
gosh should be wearing a bra are you
wearing do you even wear bras blah blah
blah honestly sometimes and stuff I
don't wear bras but most of the time I
do it's something that you're
questioning if I'm wearing a bra or not
I'm probably just wearing these in some
sort of configuration like sometimes I
just put in my own like all the way over
here so you can't see them like
in-between or whatever it just makes me
feel more comfortable to have them there
but sometimes like in this like
obviously I can get away without wearing
a bra because I'm like flat I hope that
answered your guys's questions I
definitely recommend the ones from Arry
the ones from Victoria Secret they're
good really you can just get any tan
nude colored bras from anywhere or like
whatever your skin color is because any
won't be able to see it for shirts or
see your straps and also I'm not going
to lie I pretty much just wear a tan
strapless bra every single day
matter what shirt it is even if I'm
wearing a sweater I'll just throw on a
strapless bra because literally lazy
girl probs I wear strapless bras simply
because I'm too lazy to like put the
straps on or like hook it around and
like a strapless bra you can just like
pull up from the bottom do you know what
I'm saying
I'm literally so lazy a lot of times I
just wear strapless bras and that like
cures the problem of even if you're
gonna like change into another shirt
you're already wearing a bra that will
work with it because there's nothing
more than I hate then seeing your bra or
bra straps I don't know why it makes me
cringe I hate it and I'm sure probably
some of you are like that and probably
some of you don't care like I know some
my friends don't care and they always
have their like bra strap right there
and like it's whatever I guess is like
personal preference but I'm literally I
can't tell you how many times I've
gotten this question everyone's like
what are you wearing so probably most of
the time it's one of these guys
hopefully this video is helpful for you
guys and answer to me your questions
like I said I know so many of you have
been wondering and asking like so so
much so sorry for those of you that are
watching this or like oh my gosh this is
so simple or this is common sense or I
already knew to wear like a tan bra you
might be surprised like I remember the
beginning out just wear white bras with
white shirts but if you guys know what
I'm saying you can like see it through
it like it's like really white right
there so don't want to do that I just
would wear a nude one if you don't feel
like we're here we're all just don't
because a lot of times I don't think you
guys so so much for watching this video
thumbs up if you thought it was helpful
if I helped you in any sort of way and
I'll see you my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
