what is on my iPhone video and I
actually don't burn to these about a
year ago and I just thought I would do
an updated one and it's been requested a
lot to do an updated one so I thought I
would just film that for you all today
I actually didn't even look at my old
one compared to this one so I don't know
how different the apps are but I know
there is definitely some different ones
the other day - I like cleaned out and
elated some of the ones that I didn't
use as much so I don't have that many
but I still thought it would be
interesting to show you some that you
might not have so I will assume you guys
in so you can see everything alright so
starting off at the top we have calendar
photos camera videos that's basic
everyone has that then there's maps
notes reminders then passbook newsstand
settings app store clock all that's
pretty basic little come with yours then
I have the Weather Channel app instead
of just the normal weather up because I
feel like The Weather Channel one works
better and I'm weird I like checking the
weather and seeing that then I imagine
store of course for music and then I
have at the FaceTime then the calculator
and then it starts kind of like social
media I have snapchat after light is
this app that I use to edit Instagram
photos and I know I show this in my one
before but basically you can just choose
photos to edit like that and then
there's all these different like filters
you can do you can turn the saturation
up and down like that
so yeah I really like afterlight and I
definitely recommend it to for editing
your Instagram pictures I do believe it
cost money I want to say it was like a
dollar maybe two then you have a Twitter
and Instagram of course of course you
did follow me my twitter is at GLB uit
and my Instagram is that Gretchen loves
Beauty sorry if this is weird it's just
like the bottom half of my face
talking through this video I'll go like
this there now you can see my face - and
then I have mail and then Gmail cuz I
have like two different emails ones my
business fund ones like a different one
so I had two different email thingies
and then I had YouTube of course of
course sometimes I'll watch videos on
there or just check how my videos are
doing I definitely room my comments on
there and respond to them and if you
don't have the YouTube app you should
totally have it because then you can
watch my video
and I mean get notifications to when I
post a new one so ooh and then this one
over here is moji which is actually a
new one I downloaded recently because my
friend Tasha told me about it and if you
guys know fiercely Tasha here on YouTube
she is like my BFFL they're basically
normal emojis except for they move so
like how cool is that they're almost
like little videos they're like gifts
they're really cool for texting and they
have certain ones that they don't even
have like emojis for so when you go to
text someone it just looks like this
and to get to the mogees all you have to
do is click where you would get your
normal no geez and then you click back
to ABC and then there they are so I'll
just give you a little overview of all
of them Natasha's actually friends with
a guy who helps make the moji app I've
gotten to know him he's really nice and
she said he would take suggestions for
these mochi so you guys can comment down
below mo G's that you want to see and he
will look through the comments and see
what they are and have your ideas sent
to the illustrator so they can make them
in the moji app and I think it's really
cool being able to help support my
friends friends so definitely go
download mochi if you have it already I
literally use it all the times like text
Justin and he gets so annoyed I sent him
like a million in a row but I just think
they're so cute and really fun to play
with when you're texting someone also -
I know some secret little emojis that
you can get in the app let me just show
you that one is see the guy that's
shaking his finger now right there you
hold him down you swipe this way let go
and then when you paste it it doesn't a
little like fake a lips like that so
it's really fun to text people that and
then they think that you're typing
forever but you're really not
and then another secret one which is so
good is actually a middle finger one
which I feel like I've always wanted
normal emoji for that so you go to this
guy who's like giving his thumbs up you
hold that down and you swipe to the guy
with his sunglasses so yeah I will have
moji link down below so you can go it
download it and maybe even see one of
your ideas ending up in the moji app so
moving on to the next page at the very
top we have this app which is called Li
pics Lee pics I don't
but sometimes I'll just use it to make
collages and I'm pretty sure it's free
so I have that one and then I have
Facebook which I really don't go on
Facebook that much but I know people in
college use it more so I'll probably use
that I want to go in college and I still
go on it once in a while but I don't
have like a YouTube Facebook I just have
like a personal one and then I have a
tumblr which I actually made recently I
know this wasn't on my last what's on my
iPhone video so here's my profile you
can I guess follow me if you want and
it's at Gretchen loves beauty with to
why zombocom cuz Gretchen loves beauty
with one why I was taken I haven't gone
on it in a while but now that I'm seeing
it I probably want to go on me again
because I just love looking like through
pictures then on the road below that
I've Spotify which I don't even know if
I have my own account I must but I
usually just go on to Lucy's playlist
because she has the best playlist and a
lot of you have asked me to do like
music playlist videos where I show you
music that I've been liking but honestly
I don't even like my own music I always
just listen to whatever at Lucy's
listening to so you should definitely
follow Lucy on Spotify it's just Lucy
Garrity so go follow Lucy on Spotify if
you want to know where all the music in
my videos is from and all the music I
like then I have a project at 3-6-5 and
basically it's like a calendar but for
pictures and you just have to remember
to put up a picture every day for each
day of the month and you do it all year
long and then I think at the end of the
year it might make a little collage or
something and I just think it's a really
cute idea to like keep memories for this
year then I have Netflix which sometimes
I'll just watch if I'm like in the car
and like a long car ride or sometimes if
I just want to watch netflix on my phone
usually I just watch out and like my
computer like a TV though and then I
have vine which I also don't go on vine
much but sometimes Lucy will like show
me funny vines on there okay and then
moving on to the last row I know I
really don't have that many apps at all
but this one right here is Urban Spoon
and I really just use it to find
restaurants and like places to eat when
I go different places like if I go on
vacation it'll help me find like a good
restaurant and then I have a Google Docs
app which I would use during the school
year to pull up like different documents
I needed and I have Google Drive over
here which also just had other documents
and like videos and stuff that I needed
for my classes I don't know why I didn't
go in order but the last thing right
here is PayPal which I'm sure a lot of
you know
you can use to like buy stuff online and
get money from other places so yeah that
is all that I have on my iPhone and if
you didn't notice I have the iPhone 6
it's just white and the back is gold but
I have this speck case on it and
definitely make sure to leave your
comments below on what Mochis you would
like to see in the moji app and
definitely go download it and we can
meet twins and do really funny ellipses
to our friends so they get confused and
wonder why you keep texting them so
thank you so much for watching I'll see
you my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
