gosh I literally just ate so much edible
arrangement fruit because it was so good
and I ate a bunch of the child card

pineapple and I just got so excited
because the FedEx guy just came and look
what he brought I was so sure that the
other triangle bathing suit that was
being sent to me was not gonna come in
time for rubra because it said it was
supposed to be delivered December 28th
and it just showed up at the front door
and I'm so happy it's this white top
like that and then the bottoms look like
that they're just like navy blue with
some floral print I guess it's a
Christmas miracle that it came in time
because I know it wasn't supposed to so
I'm really happy there's a bunch of fun
stuff I got from Target or a rue but I'm
just gonna work out really quick and
then I have to help cook for an hour I
keep saying New Year's Eve it's not New
Year's Eve Christmas Eve at dinner
it's been a good day so far I just
finished working out and I just ride and
I have to edit and put a puppeteer right
now because it's literally like holiday
inspired in today's Christmas Eve so
like it has to
today it'll probably go quickly tonight
or something I'm just cuz like you guys
don't even know I don't know if I'm just
like slow editing but I literally stay
up like all night every night editing
these videos I don't know why I just
takes me a long time and then like
during like nighttime I would say
between the hours of like 8:00 in like
11 p.m. I'm usually like with friends
and family like having fun so I don't
know like give up that time to edit the
footage later during the day so usually
I start editing at like 12:00 like when
I get back home and I'm like ready for
bed and I have to add it until like 2:00
or 3:00 and then I like try to get it up
and then before you know it's where I am
and I'm like halfway dead trying to
upload vlogmas so I don't know I'm
complaining like there's one day left
but just you guys know like why I'm like
aw like all the time but yeah I just
like I've know I've said this before
like it's so much working so tiring but
like I still love it it's so fun and
it'll be really good to like look back
at I know you guys like vlogmas and like
vlogging videos so yeah I have to edit
that like it took a holiday lookbook it
was really fun like putting together the
outfits and stuff it just takes me so
long to edit so I'm just like not good
at editing I should probably like get
better with anything but yeah that's
what's going on and then we're gonna for
Christmas Eve dinner my dad was like can
you help me and I was like dad look I'm
really sorry but I can't help cook
because I have to edit these videos so
guys I'm all clean and showered I felt
like so gross before because I like
worked out and ate and looks like with
my family but I'd never like showered
anything cuz I was busy putting on my
last minute holiday video and I don't
know I'm like so smiling and just like
happy right now because I can't believe
it's Christmas Eve and I'm so excited my
family here and tomorrow's me Christmas
and then I'm leaving for trubiz oh dude
and also I went to a dress I saw comment
on one of my last blog misses today and
I thought it was seriously so funny
someone was like new drinking game every
time she talks about Aruba take a shot I
was like that's so funny
I like send it to Justin and he was like
oh my gosh they would be dead like so
drunk because I like I always talk about
every but I also just want to share with
you today at Target I got if you think I
look tan right now I think I look really
tan I got
Maybelline New York Dream bronze bb-8
and one beauty balm sunkissed glow
Perfector sunscreen broad-spectrum SPF
25 and I got it in the shade
light/medium but it's like so dark like
if you can see my skin right now it's
literally so dark so I'm really happy I
got this and I knew I wanted to get
something that was like kind of like a
tinted moisturizer that I could put on
my face during the day like when I'm at
the beach but I know I didn't want like
foundation because I've really dark like
foundations but I was I'm not gonna have
foundation at the beach always wanted to
try the Maybelline BB cream Lucy's used
it for a while and she just has been
normal like light/medium one like I've
used it like once or twice but it was
when my skin was like really really bad
like my skin isn't that good right now
but it was when I was like really bad so
I couldn't even tell if it was like
working well because I was like oh I can
see my pimples and I just like didn't
really give it a fair shot so I was like
I'm gonna try this one out but also
another thing I noticed is that it says
it has sunkissed glow and click
illuminating look at my fingers right
now I don't know if you can tell but
they're all like shimmery orange can you
see that there's like shimmers on them
it's from the BB cream and if you
remember I think and I what I got for
Christmas last year
I wore this onesie in that video and
I'll probably even wear it tomorrow too
for old times sake and Lucy has it too
and we're both gonna like snuggle and I
would sleep over tonight and we were
matching onesies and hugs even off hurry
so it's like so cozy and I and I would
say for this BB cream so far so good I
really like it I know it'll be good
like at the beach and I'm tan and like
as you can see it's like BB cream like
you couldn't still see like pretty much
all my pimples underneath of it but like
it has good coverage for like what it is
and I know that it's good that it has
like SPF in it and it's like tan
remember if you Michael watch elf with
our family I can't believe it's
Christmas Eve like doesn't feel the same
to like being in college and being home
like when I was younger I would like
freaked out about Christmas even
something it like I don't know like it
feels different I'm still really excited
but like I can't wait for Santa to come
I'm so excited but like you know you
know I have to go wrap dresses Christmas
present I still wouldn't wrap them
they're like sitting over there in the
corner so guys I just did teeth
whitening like I showed in the last
couple of videos umm the like smile
science is one I'll link the video down
below where I talk about them more and
like have the link to their website and
I
maybe even oh yeah I have a discount
code for you guys I know that it's just
Gretchen if you type in Gretchen you get
it for like $29 I'm pretty sure from
smiles I just and I first has a cone
just try it out whatever guys look at my
teeth like do you see this this is so
insane I just did the little trees and
yesterday I usually put him in for like
20 minutes and I leave like the light
thingy on them because I think the light
makes them like white and quicker I'm
not sure if that actually works but I
just do it anyway and it's never
bothered me except for yesterday I don't
know why I think I put too much gel in
the trees and it must have been seeping
out of my gums or something because my
mouth was burning and it hurts so bad so
usually I leave it in for 20 minutes
yesterday I think I did like maybe 10 or
15 I mean like today was fine today I
did it again but I was more careful when
I was like putting the gel in the trays
and like I don't know why just today
when I took it off and like rinse at my
mouth like my teeth are so freakin white
like do you guys see this this is so
crazy maybe it's just cuz my skin turgor
because like I was just talking about my
BB cream but I don't know why my teeth
are so white look I can't
yeah I'm look I'm not even getting paid
to say this at all but like I guess if
you want white teeth like check it out
because it's working pretty well for me
and I saw as I go wrap Christmas
resident smell I don't feel like it all
