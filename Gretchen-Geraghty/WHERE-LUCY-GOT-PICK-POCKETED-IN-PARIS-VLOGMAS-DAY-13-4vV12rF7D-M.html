I made it to Lucy's room right now I'm
looking outside of her window there's
the tram gia actually got me from the
airport but then her internship started
at 11:00 and she was like I'm gonna be
late I like my way back to my little
apartment dorm with you and then trying
to go so I have to go straight there but
you're just gonna get off at your own
stop and get in and I was so nervous I
literally don't speak French but I made
it she had to get off like four stops
earlier than me and she had to give me a
code to get into the building and then
the code to get into the right wing and
then our key to get into the her actual
room but I made it and I'm so tired just
leave all day because it's 11 a.m. here
which means it's 5 a.m.
American time and so I didn't sleep at
all last night so I'm bout to sleep all
day and I'll probably wake up and Lucy
wakes me up from her internship when she
comes back at 7 p.m. so that is the plan
for today you can't tell I'm sick I
don't want to complain because I feel
guy would come I draw this you guys now
but whenever I travel I get sick and
I've done everything I can to try to not
get sick and I still do vignette can you
see my lymph node oh there you can this
I busy really cute decided to really
tone this side not as much why just my
left side so this one it hurts so bad my
tonsils aren't too bad which is out of
the usual cuz normally they are but just
my lymph nodes my throat whatever I'm
gonna sleep all day I hope like it's
better we'll see you tonight very maybe
some like Paris dinner it's so crazy to
be back today a little lose you to me
feel like I just feel like I know it so
well now that I second that surprise
guys oh yeah I found Lucy a little bit
it's raining
oh yeah I remember that no one white
leggings here saying we're like oh
that's everything jeans every day
because I'm like when I would like
exactly cuz people probably like treat
you weirder like that's so funny
good things put your arms out pop a
squat
your arm out when it's your face don't
itch my face oh that's a good look so
gross okay so it is currently 8 p.m. I'm
so turned on because I got here I got to
your bed at like 11:15 I would say and I
didn't fall asleep to like 12 so I have
slept for like 8 hours like I slept all
day so I don't know how I'm gonna sit
through the night I probably so well
though cuz I feel like really sick you
could probably tell I sound sick so Lucy
is bringing me she's dragging me to this
pasta place right now but she says it's
a never ever and I so oh my god you went
to the Apple store and got it today yeah
yeah put it back in the box mind just
literally broke wait I'll show you mine
I'll show you mine I was trying to mess
around with it today and it literally
just that was 50 bucks right or is it
over 55 euros which means like $70 and I
knew it was gonna be so much well it's
$50 in America why didn't I get you want
to bring it look it look it with me oh
that happened to my other one and I
literally envisioned of that oh boy look
like guys look at these stupid
converters if you have the new MacBook
like Apple I'm seriously so unimpressed
when I talk to you today his thought I
was French with it so confusing mary
vlogmas day 13 I texted Lucy on facebook
messenger cuz she still loves them fuck
whatever its Denton customs here anyway
when I was waiting in customs once I got
to Paris but non European passport line
was obviously like a million miles long
and the European passport was like empty
because there was just I don't know I
think they're all like international
blood coming in and then a guy came up
to me he's like man passport and I
showed it to him he was like oh like you
look so French like he thought that I'd
be European password I was like
we we said yes but yeah I'm like eyelid
I feel like I look like the most basic
like American anyway but okay yeah we're
gonna go Lucy said she just clogged this
our first day of augment and it's so
pretty
I dare you to go under that waterfall
guys rod this pasta place it's Lucy's
favorite and I'm so scared right now
because Lucy was standing right here
paying and that's someone to pick
pocketer and grab your phone they just
walked by and grabbed in your pocket
right there on that leaf food thing and
I turned around and I immediately
thought I was like no no Julia I'm
keeping my hand up here as a possibility
and so
it's gotten so much height so it better
be good if you didn't still eat with
your cast and actually know what that's
like I would I try to sign things in my
right hand or something
who's ever near so skinny nobody think
looks so hot
that was so quick my noodles look so
good
he told me that mine was with like
sausage ricotta so I was like okay and
there's a weird raw like pepperoni look
at me guys
oh my god I just had one is oh here
it's like sauce I've never had before
and these noodles are so cool
goofy brought the bag at home I don't
even know this
it's like squiggly I've never seen a
porch so good by its luck me unless
you're gonna go home but then we decided
to explore you know what Abby told me
every time I started a blog clip I said
guys look look obviously they're looking
after watching so we're just walking by
this end and wait Lucy what does it call
Notre Dom I learned this from last time
we were here I look over
lucy was just telling me about how her
boyfriend Dora
he's from Ireland and so the first time
he went to Spain that's the first time
he saw blue skies because in Ireland it
rains every day and they were like
taking pictures they thought it was like
the coolest thing ever
is it ever like really sunny in Paris
yeah I think the first day I got here
was pretty stunning but it's usually
kind of cloudy and rainy yeah like part
of the day it'll like clear up the
lighting is just impeccable for a night
time they knew I was coming all these
lights are for our blog</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
