video that's actually going to be
referring you to another video that is
on my second channel which is my vlog
channel of my twin sister Lucy and that
channel is called Gretchen and Lucy as
you can tell by the title we went vegan
and the reason I went vegan is for
actually many reasons so all those
reasons are going to be discussed it's
quite a long video we had a lot to say
in that video is going to be linked down
below this video is just telling you to
go watch that video because that is on
our vlog Channel even though normally we
just do kind of vlogs like what we're
doing in a day we decided since that
video really encompassed like both of
our feelings and our ideas and our
thoughts that we would just put it
together on our blog channel so like I
said if you're wondering why the heck I
went vegan go check out that video
subscribe to our vlog Channel we make
pretty much daily vlogs and if you guys
didn't watch Lucy made a YouTube channel
video that's all so I'll have that link
down below we have a bucket list for the
summer so that's pretty much what we're
doing in our vlogs we try to do
something off the bucket list every day
but this videos about why I went vegan
so definitely go watch the why I went
vegan video I hope it inspires some of
you and you know maybe just gets you
thinking about why we went vegan and
yeah that is all I have to say go check
out that video and I'll see you my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
