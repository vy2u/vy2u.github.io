this hotel room like I couldn't thank
you enough because obviously I wanted to

get your till 12 because there's so much
traffic I can't wait to just come up
here and the guys like oh it's a new

and I'm like okay it's midnight she's
sleeping I'm not waking her up like come
on buddy and then he was like oh let me
see if your name's like added to the
reservation and it all worked out but it
was kind of like stressful for a second
I'm like oh gosh so yeah basically not
being 21 is also rough to you because
then they like it's a bigger deal
because you're not like 21 oh I don't
know whatever but I want to show you

nice and the only issue is when I walked
in it was set at 60 degrees for a night
