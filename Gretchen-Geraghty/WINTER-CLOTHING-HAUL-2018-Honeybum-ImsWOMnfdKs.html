for you guys and you guys know I love
doing these haul videos like I literally
feel like I just post so many hauls now
and can you comment below if you like
hauls because I really like them they're
my favorite videos to watch because they
just help me know like what clothes I
like and because I want to buy you guys
don't follow me on instagram or do what
are you doing and term is literally my
favorite thing and if you guys do you
follow me you know that I've been
posting like literally bajillion times
today like I just got back from Aruba so
I've been posting so much and so you
might be everything ever and just follow
me okay I was invited to tell you if you
use my co2 Gretchen 20 you'll get 20%
off everything on honey balm which is
even better because even though the
clothes are already really affordable
you can save even more money so yeah
it's just really great you guys ready no
honey mom is literally my favorite
online store ever literally like the
majority of my clothes are from there
now
so this first top is a little wrinkly it
was thrown into a little pile of stuff
but it's super super cute it's just like
a white kind of like 3/4 sleeve top and
it ties in the front and I love like the
Crossy tie tops right now they're so in
and they're so cute and I love it just
plain white white is definitely my
favorite color to wear okay then I got
this navy blue sweatshirt II sweater
thing that I think is so so cute and
it's just like navy blue sweater and it
has these pink furry details on the
sleeves and I love love love those
little details it's so cute I have one
other like white sweater that I got when
I was in Paris that has like free little
details on the sleeves and I just think
it's so cute and I get mancini's around
a lot they're very in right now so I
definitely recommend this one because so
many of the pieces from honey bomb are
super affordable any one was just
amazing they think very like hidden gems
or everyone said oh my god where's that
from from honey bum it's not even
expensive this next thing I feel is one
of the hidden gems of honey button
before you judge I know it looks very
scandalous I do understand that however
I have a very specific outfit in mind
when I show this I think of this
obviously it looks like lingerie I don't
really think of it like that though
because I would wear it it's like a
little body suit like camisole tank top
underneath like a leather jacket with
like high-waisted jeans like a belt so
like a lot like covering it so you would
just see it kind of like peeking out
right here just like some red
and this little black crop top I thought
was so adorable I love that their stuff
is like basic with like cute little
twists to it like I love how this laces
up on the side I think that's really
cute you could never go wrong with a
plain black crop top oh then they spotty
sue I love my friends we're so confused
when I was holding it up like how you
wear it so probably it's a little
confusing but it's just like a plain
black crop top like the last one except
it kind of connects down into like a
bodysuit but then the back is like open
so it just kind of looks like it's open
on the side you know and again this is
like so adorable so good for going out
boo than this I was so excited for you
guys remember might have been my last 21
ha video or the one before it
I got a black crop top or no this is a
lack crop top I got a white crop top
that is this exact crop top but in white
so then I was so obsessive that I loved
it so much that I got it in black
because I wish like I don't even know
how to describe this to you guys like I
don't know if you can see the inside is
like soft and furry like it's a really
thick nice knit material but the inside
is so soft and like warm so this is like
perfect for the winter I know it looks
really funny holding up right now but
you can see on how it just crosses and
crop tops are my favorite thing the
other day I was wearing a shirt that
wasn't cropped miry it was like oh my
god you're not wearing a crop top like
right now I'm not wearing a crop top and
they're like oh my god you're not
wearing a crop top because I live in
cops house I don't know why I think I'm
just more comfortable in them and I
usually wear high-waisted things so they
just go with highways and things then I
got this black simple dress and you can
never have too many black simple dresses
and I love this trend of like stretchy
straps on if you can tell it's like thin
stretchy straps like the square neckline
obviously that's so like any trendy
right now and just really soft stretchy
black dress so I love this has an
alternative to like uncomfortable black
dresses because this one is so comfy but
looks so nice
and I would still recommend this if you
need a little black dress okay than this
I'm so excited for I don't know if you
guys remember I'm pretty sure that I do
it wall or might another one before
again it's like this black Teddy I think
that's what it's called
like bodysuit and it's like
short-sleeved and just goes like that
and to like a really deep V and it's all
lace and it's beautiful and this is like
the long-sleeved version of this when we
I know this looks so no thing enough
like you literally can just see me right
through it like obviously it's very
sheer but you would wear like a bra wet
underneath of it and again I think this
would just be so cute for like nighttime
or going out and it's like so dainty and
I love it already the last two things I
just show you this I just think is so
fun I have nothing like this it's just
this like snakeskin print bodycon dress
and I just feel like this is so fun and
will be such a statement and like really
cool on Instagram you guys know it it's
good someone actually told me recently
this little half ternal my thing is
called like a mock neck so I think
that's what it's called and it's just
like a long sleeve oh this feels like
the really good quality like thick soft
material it's like stretchy this is
gonna be so nice your stuff is such good
quality like this is like good stuff
okay then last but not least I have this
puffy silver vest that kind of looks
like a Hershey kiss actually I didn't
even think of it like that until my
roommate yesterday was like oh my god
that looks like a Hershey kiss however
if you guys are Mac McDonald she's like
my best friend
I love her so much and she had a silver
jacket that kind of looks like this a
short of the Super Bowl and you know
I'll just try this on right now because
like look at how cool it is like with
this outfit I feel like it's just so
edgy and just as like a papow adds like
a big you know so I think this is like
so fun to just like add to any outfit
and make it look really like I don't
know like stand out but yeah she had
like a long-sleeve coat version of this
vest that I think she got from like
forever 21 and she wore it to the Super
Bowl and it looked so cool and Instagram
so I was just really excited that I got
this one hi I'm filming a video I want
to be in it
I like just finished I just filmed a
haul video in Taylor's room cuz I had
such good lighting
Thank You Taylor if we're not being here
