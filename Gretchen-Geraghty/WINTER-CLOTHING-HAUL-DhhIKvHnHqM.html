video for you guys and I'm going to be
filming this haul video the other stuff
I'm showing you I like love and I'm so
happy that I got that I can't wait to
wear that and I got so many shoes if you
guys saw haul video that I posted like
about a month ago I talked about this
website called Z issue and I got a bunch
of shoes I'm a little crazy got some
more shoes and this doesn't like show
you how obsessed I've been with shoes I
can't even tell you
servers five things I have to show you
are shoes
four of them are Steve Madden and one of
them is Sam Edelman oh my gosh
guys I can't even tell you look at how
excited I am I got so many Steve Madden
shoes and then a pair of Sam Edelman
shoes I know I said this before but
Steve Madden shoes are seriously my
favorite shoes ever like most my shoes
are C Madden just because they're my
favorite kind so I'm so excited that I
got these because we're such good
quality I'm gonna wear them all the time
and honestly I've always wanted to
choose from Sam Edelman just because I
think it's such a cool brand all of
these shoes are from in this website
called su shoe and I'm so happy that I
found a new shoe because they have so
many different brands they like Steve
Madden Sam Edelman remember saying this
before too but I know that I'm Steve
Madden a lot of times like sizes and
colors will like sell out but then if
you check out a new shoe a lot of times
they have like the same ones and I have
your size which is great because I'm an
8 or an 8 and a half and usually the 8
million halves are gone because I feel
like every girl is like a 7 or an 8 so
when is if she has my size I'm like yes
it's definitely a great website if
you're like obsessed with shoes like me
and I'll have all of these link down
below so you can check them out and also
you have a chance to wear a free pair of
shoes and three lucky ones of you will
be chosen so all that will be a link
down below and even if you don't win you
get 15% off so the first pair I'll show
you this box is empty because I wore the
shoes today so I just got these at brown
booties in an 8 and a half and I have
our last time the shoes I got I got most
of them like in a year and a half and
sometimes and a half's are snug
sometimes eight and a half sore big like
it really just depends on the shoe some
of these are actually nines because I
know eight and half feel a little tight
anyways these are an eight and a half
they fit me perfect I'm so happy that I
found these puppies because they are
just literally adorable Brown sweet
little booties they have a little heel
okay to me this heel does not seem this
big right look it seemed kind of small
but walking around in them I feel like
they make me so tall seriously I'm
obsessed with these like they're so cute
and they looked so good with my outfit
I'm wearing this sweater
with some loose like dark-wash really
distressed ripped boyfriend jeans and
these are just so so adorable I'm so
happy I got these I seriously love them
plus they make that like clicking noise
when I walk around I like walk down come
to my classes and I'm like blah blah
blah and I like didn't hear the click of
my shoes I feel so important next ones
I'll show you are these flats and
they're called quilt in black they just
look like this they're these black flats
and they're so cute because they have
this like quilted texture on them and I
just love them for those of you that
know I'm transferring to the business
school here at BU I was a bio major
before it didn't really work out I just
was not happy so far I've been like
loving my business classes it's so
awesome so you have to like dress up
more like actually look nice and I am
actually excited that I have to dress up
because I like dressing up so yeah I'll
definitely get a lot of use out of these
they're gonna be great
when I don't feel like wearing heels and
for those me that's not my last home
video where I showed a bunch of Steve
Madden shoes I got these ones in nude
but this time I just got them in black
they're just these pointy toe little
flats I think they're so cute and
different because they kind of have a
little open space right here so you can
like see your foot I didn't have any
black flats that would point in toe so
like I said these are going to be a
super great when I don't feel like
wearing heels I'm so ridiculous I just
realized the last shoes I showed you in
these ones I actually got nude in my
last haul and I'm showing you them in
black because I just love them so much I
wanted to get them in another color I
always do that when I really like
something I have to get it in more than
them color any of you guys like that
like if I really like something I will
definitely be getting it in like tan
black white like everything anyways I
got these black putting in toe pumps
they are in the style proto black
leather I have these in nude they're
just like the best most basic pump ever
pointed toe you know and I want to say
these are like maybe three and a half
inch heels or four inches and thank you
one of you commented on my last video
saying that you're like a business
professional and like work in the
business world and you said that usually
the rule of thumb is like above three
inches is kind of more like evening wear
and you want to keep your business ones
like under three inches so these she
said we're like on the edge of like
being a businesslike evening wear shoes
so I might be able to get away with
these in business class the next where
I'm going to show you or like shorter
the last pair of to show you
these Sam Edelman ones these ones are
gonna be really good for business
because they're like shorter these ones
are like maybe one and a half inches two
inches they just have this a buckle that
goes around the top they're closed toed
and they're pointed and also I don't
know why maybe just because it's more
like professional in my business classes
they want us to only wear like closed
toed shoes so it's really good that all
the shoes I got are closed toed so I can
wear them in my business classes Sam
Edelman has the cutest shoes do you guys
know those ones they have flats and
heels like them that have like all these
like rhinestones and like spikes on the
bag I don't know why I remember seeing a
picture of them like legit probably four
or five years ago thought they were so
cute boys one of them so factor Sam head
let me make me happy and don't forget
like I said they're all linked down
below as well if you are interested oh
my gosh all the shoes I got were black
except for these Wow I just realized oh
my gosh clearly I'm not really branching
out in my neutrals but you know the next
place I have stuff from is Windsor store
and it's just like this online boutique
that has much cute clothes and shoes but
I got more shoes guys okay I couldn't
help myself
I was actually debating whether to get
these from Windsor or Steve Madden
because Steve Madden has a pair that
looks just like these they're called
like this Stacy or like Stacy and I was
gonna buy them but they're like more
expensive and these ones were like a
cheaper alternative many times I already
got so many other Steve Madden shoes I
decided I would get these ones and
everyone's restored and they're just
really cute they have just like the thin
strap over your toes these ones are
actually pretty high too I can never
tell like how high shoes are and got
mine you know so these are kind of hot I
just have a thin strap that goes around
your ankles I'll probably wear more in
the summer too since they're like
open-toed and I just really like them
and then I have three more things to
show you from Windsor the first two are
dresses and I'm so excited I got this I
saw this on the website and I was like
that's beautiful I need it it's so
Freddie it's like this white and black
like floral print and it kind of cuts
lower and in the front it crosses in the
back like that it's really nice quality
I don't even know material this is but
it's like thick but kind of like shiny
and soft and this will be like perfect
for my business presentations and with
all like the black shoes I got I look so
fancy I can't wait the next dress I got
is a little more casual it's just long
sleeve and like flowy and I love long
sleeve dress because I remember I had
this black long-sleeve one from brandy
melville and I wear it all the time
because it's just like black and
how uncomfortable and goes everything
but you like looks like you tried really
hard cuz wearing a dress and reality you
don't even have to match anything to it
there's my secret I always wear dresses
and I don't feel like trying to match
because it's just like one piece so I
don't know this is just pretty it's just
this great dress it's just like open in
the back a little and it's just flowy it
is a little short so I have to be
careful about that cuz I'm like five
nine but it's still so cute and I love
it and the last thing I got is a little
scandalous it is this black bodysuit it
just kind of Criss crosses up the front
or I guess like Lisa's up and it's so
adorable like I'm not gonna be like
wearing this to class don't worry oh
when I go out
just kidding for those of you that know
me I'm literally such a nerd all I could
wear this out to dinner with like Lucy
because that's all I do I like that it's
a bodysuit and it's really tight so you
can like tuck it in like skirts or like
high-waisted shorts or something and
I'll have everything that I got from
loser a link down below so you can go
and check it out and of course it
wouldn't be a glv haul video without
some Lululemon so I just sent a little
lemon the other day and I'm so excited
it was the stuff that I got I have each
other mental health video and I just got
them like a week ago so the first thing
I got are these toasty tektites and I'm
so excited that I got these they're just
season black long leggings from a little
women but they're not just normal
leggings because the whole inside is
like this fuzzy material it's so great
like it's so great for the winter and if
you weren't outside when it's really
cold and they're like thick like on the
sides they're all quilted to keep you
nice and warm and they pockets best
investment ever I just love these yeah I
got this white tank top and this style
tank top is like my favorite kind from
the lemon cuz it's just like nice and
breathable just like a racerback and
I've wanted the white one for so long
matches with everything since it's white
and yeah very last thing I have to show
you is just as white tank top I think
they look nice with like the thin straps
just like that but this one's special
for so many reasons guys okay the other
ones I have are like this kind of
thicker like athletic like working out
material I really know how to describe
it but this I saw and I was like what
the heck like it's like soft and
stretchy it's like so soft like I love
it and then I saw that it was on sale I
couldn't believe it
yes I'm I just was just guess it's only
$34 and I didn't have a white ink top in
this color it's just everything I have
to show you this haul video I feel like
it was longer than it should have been
because I talked about everything like
so much but I'm just really excited
everything that I got and yeah if you
get any of this same things is me be
sure to LIKE tweet them at me because I
love when you guys to me that we're
wearing like matching things we can be
twins it's my favorite thing ever so
yeah thank you so much for watching I'll
see my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
