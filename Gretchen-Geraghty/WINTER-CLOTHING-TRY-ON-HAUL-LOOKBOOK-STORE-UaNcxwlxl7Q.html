haul video and I know the last video I
posted like a couple days ago as a haul
video but I just have been getting lots
of clothes recently for the fall and
winter weather so I just have something
to show you from a look book store and I
know I showed you guys stuff from a book
store before but they just have so much
cute stuff so I got some more clothes
from there that I will just be showing
you today and also I haven't gotten
lipstick in the longest time so today I
just decided to throw on this like dark
lipstick for this video so I don't know
let me know what you think I feel kind
of weird wearing lipstick right now but
I don't know what do you think guys and
in case you're wondering I think it was
like a limited edition one from Mac so I
don't even know the name but yeah it's
just like some Mac one guys look this is
so sad this is the fifth iPhone I have
cracked and this is just a gold 6 that I
was running down the street the other
day and it fell out of my sweatshirt
pocket and fell on the back in the front
cracked and that happened to my 5s as
well and this has a speck case and like
a protective like a screen protector
thing on the front and yet it's still
cracked underneath the protector so this
is really sad sad time for glb hopefully
I can get a new one I was telling myself
that it was God telling me that I'm
supposed to get the 6s look that pink
one that came out because I think is so
pretty so maybe I should just get the
pink one but yeah this is like a really
sad time for me and if we actually you
guys would know this if you follow me on
twitter it's that GLB whitey if you
don't follow me go ahead and follow me
but yeah I like tweeted a really sad
picture of me holding this being like
okay I'm gonna show you how close I got
out alright the first thing I got from
Alec bookstore is just this black little
crochet bralette type thing actually
I've it's like a bro light more like a
cross between a bralette and like a crop
top but you can wear this with like
really high-waisted pants or like a
skirt or something
I got named tan from my book store
before so I have the tan one and I knew
I
liked it so I decided to eat the black
one and I know you're probably thinking
like Gretchen it's like cold out right
now I know I can wear in like Aruba is
where it's bringing somewhere to so I
just think this is really cute and if I
really really wanted to I could wear
with like high-waisted stuff and like a
bunch of sweaters and layers and wear
right now if I was feeling ambitious and
the next thing I got is like also a
little bra let and it's just a black one
just like the last one but the back
looks like that it just has all these
little straps and it's actually run meet
over Bartlet that I saw every people
that I really loved
but Free People it's way more expensive
so yeah this is just great and it'll be
cute under a whole bunch of things and
the next team things I'll show you our
just necklaces and this is just a gold
layered necklace that has three
different layers as you can see one's
like a little bar ones just like a
little circle pendant and I think this
is really cute I don't think I have any
gold layered necklaces so I really like
this one and then the next layer
necklace is just this silver one that
also has three layers and it has like a
bar like a little triangle in just
another little bar at the bottom silver
jewelry is my favorite so I know where
this one a lot and yeah we'll just look
cute with like a lot of basic things it
can help dress it up and then the next
thing I got from a book store is just
this long-sleeve white shirt that kind
of goes crossing like that in the front
it just kind of is all drapey and I've
been looking at styles of shirts like
this for a while and I've been thinking
that they're like so cute and I've
always wanted one so I'm really happy I
got this one it just is really like
unique how it does that in the front and
it's just long-sleeve and I really love
white tops if you guys know me because I
don't know I just always wear white tops
I feel like they go with most things
they make you tan
and the next thing I got is this black
long-sleeve dress
I didn't realize oh my god it the type
of material it was it's kind of more
like stretchy and thin than I thought it
just feels kind of expanding see you
guys now
but the front just looks like that it's
just all plain black but then the back
is really cool because it's all open and
it has those like crisscross see design
so this is like super cool and I don't
have a dress like this so I know where
this a bunch of when I go out and the
next thing I got is just this black and
white sweater it's kind of like salt and
pepper
colored and it's just this big cozy
comfy sweater that I forgot to show so I
just love it and it's so warm in that
and then I just have two more things to
show you from a book store and they're
both sweaters and the first letter is
just this big cozy white one it's just
plain and it's like a big pullover
sweater but then the back is super cool
because it dips really low like that
like a V so you can wear like a bra
even like this that has the different
crisscross designs because I would look
really cool you could have it be
completely open scandalous you could see
here hold back so I just think this is
really cool and it's really really
really thick and will keep you warm so I
really like this and the last thing I
have to show you is just as cream
cardigan I was just thinking at my last
whole video how I showed you guys that I
got a cream cardigan but I got another
one because you literally can never have
enough like I wear like all the time
anyway and this one's even thicker than
that one this one's like really like
heavy duty and just has some pockets on
the sides and it's again like
long-sleeve and just open in the front
and I think this is really nice too
perfect for layering the cold weather so
yeah that's everything I got from luck
bookstore if you don't follow me on my
Instagram you'd really should it's a
Christian ones beauty and like I said
