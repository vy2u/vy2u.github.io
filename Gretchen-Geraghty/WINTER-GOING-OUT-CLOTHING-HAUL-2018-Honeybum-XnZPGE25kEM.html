for you guys and you guys already know
honey bum is my favorite store of all
time it's probably very clear to most of
you so I have my voice I'm super rude
right now
I'm always sick my voice is always gone
I don't know what's wrong with me trying
to take care of myself the best I can
you guys always leave comments I'm sorry
so everything I'm showing you in this
video is going to be at 20% off with my
code at Gretchen 20 so definitely go it
utilize that because their stuff is
already pretty affordable and just so
trendy and so darn cute like I wear them
every time I go out and to class and
just every day and then with my code you
get it and then percent off so go for it
sorry I'm sitting on the ground in front
of my kitchen right now I just thought
it was like kind of good lighting the
sun's going down so it was like a little
wonky in my room anyway let's show you
guys what I got from honey button the
first thing I want to show you is so
dang cute my friend Hannah was just
visiting for the weekend and she
actually wear this one night when we
went out it's just this sheer body to
which obviously looks very scandalous
right but it's super cute with sure like
a black bra underneath and just like
high-waisted jeans and it's just like so
adorable and oh it's just so cute for
going out I love it and it's super
different I like nothing like this so I
love that and then the next thing I want
to tell you about is literally gorgeous
like please do yourself a favor ladies
if you're in college you go out and you
want look cute buy this I'll have
everything link down below as well it's
just black lace bodysuit and I can't
even show you right now because I have
no idea where it went I wore it out on
Friday yeah Friday Hannah wear this on
Friday and then we're this black lace
short sleeve bodysuit that goes down and
took a really deep v it's so cute it's
so flattering I literally love this it
just has a little string tie in the back
I actually just wore it with like sticky
boobs but I would probably recommend
wearing a bra light underneath so that
there's a little more coverage going on
but if you like don't really care you
can wear it sticky boobs like me so yeah
I just that's definitely my favorite
thing in this whole haul next favorite
thing is probably this sweater Hanna was
also obsessed of it she was like guys so
cute it's a sweater and it literally
feels like there's no way this is like
real cashmere because of the price but
um it feels so soft and just like really
like nice quality it feels like so
expensive and just as Sunday in this
light blue
and it's like gray and this is so cute
and it's like really cute and it's
significant and this sweater I got I
think is so adorable as well it's just
yellow crop sweater again like the
material like both of these are so soft
and like think and nice I just feel like
so expensive in bougie and then just
highs on the side which I love at that
little detail I think it's so cute then
I'll show you I got this black dress
guys which I know I mentioned this a
bunch before but I love honey bum as
well for like their rompers and dress
selection because since I'm in Astoria
here at BU there's like lots of formals
and events we have to go to where we
like dress up more so I'm always looking
for like plain little black dresses or
yeah stuff like that so I just got this
black bodycon dress and what I love
about this is how like open it is in the
back it's like a cool little detail so I
love this you can never have a too many
little black dresses women this sweater
again with the soft like thick and nice
material it's just red sweater and it's
like a turtleneck kind of thing going on
they want to wear this tomorrow I just
decided I'm wearing this tomorrow and I
always had jeans to meet really cute and
it's like super cross which I love and I
love how like see this sleeves just how
they go like that from the bottom I like
that I just think it's like a really
cute look I don't know and yeah so it's
really calm but you can just bare with
heavy stuff and then like I said you
could never have too many little black
dresses I would say is like a little
more casual just because it like the
lease is up to front like that so it
just like laces up you can like tie it
again super flattering I love just like
body con black dresses especially long
sleeve ones long sleeve black body con
dresses or my favorite I just feel so
like confident in that they're just like
really flattering I don't know I've just
ever since I remember like ninth grade
of high school I would always want black
bodycon dress it's like dances and stuff
I just love them I just yeah I love them
so I'd recommend that and then this
white top I got is so adorable it's just
white long-sleeve little crop top
it just Criss crosses right there in the
front this is really soft material too I
really enjoyed this again just look
really cute with some high waisted
things wow I've been going through this
pretty quick I'm in really efficient I
guess but um last thing I got is just
this red crop top and if you remember
from honey bum I got this in white not
too long ago and it's so adorable I'm
literally obsessed with that top so I
had to get it in a different color
she says rebels on the sleeves ruffles
on the bottom pretty crops I like the
little plunging neckline and again just
so adorable I'm literally obsessed with
everything that I got so yeah I think
knows everything sorry if I seem like so
like out of it right now really tired
I'm definitely getting ill I'm always
ill if you can tell can you tell there's
like a packet Pedialyte right up there
