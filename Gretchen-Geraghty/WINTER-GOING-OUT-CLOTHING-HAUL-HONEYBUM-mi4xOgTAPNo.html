literally looks just like this it's so
white and so fluffy and furry
just like the fluffy snowflakes anyway I
was in brainy Melville and a girl

arm she's like oh my gosh like where's
this from like I've been looking for a
fluffy white jacket and I was like honey
bum sweetheart like you gotta go oh my
gosh and you can use a coat of grunty
2424 self I know off their whole website
so don't forget when you're looking at
all these clothes on there use gretchen
2008 20% off so that's even better and
their stuff like is pretty affordable I
would say as it is like it's not like
crazy expensive so with the 20% off it's
like so good anyway I'm getting very
excited you couldn't tell that's
something that I do it is red it is
beautiful it is just everything you've
ever wanted in a shirt I am obsessed
with a style right now just how like
cinches right at your waist and ties I
think it's like so flattering
and I love life the long sleeve tonight
is actually our legs birthday well like
tomorrow's his birthday son Dan he's
turning 21 but like he turns 21 at
midnight you know tonight so maybe I'll
wear this for his little birthday
extravaganza we will see TV follow me on
Instagram then you build a seat enough
so from this top is seriously so soft
guys I love it so much
me and Abby both wore it yesterday
because it's literally like wearing a
plush velvet soft like a blanket on your
arms and I love the cut of it bottom see
how it dips down a little bit so again
like so flattering and like cropped it
looks so good with like high-waisted
skirt how I said sure high-waisted jeans
and then it's hard to see but we can say
just ties up the bag there's a little
bow at the bottom then this top also a
solid faith guys this and the red would
also be like so good for going out
because also wear like during the day I
love like plunging neckline things
because I just think it's like such a
pretty like detail and I just like I
don't know I feel comfortable in shirts
that like go oh of course in size I wear
like a turtleneck just really like the
way they look I think they're really
flattering and this one just goes like
really deep in the front and it's like
this dark is it black or dark navy blue
I don't even know I can't tell really
bad with colors it's like dark navy blue
next to my black sweater right but like
maybe between Navy and black whatever
you could probably wear as if it was
navy or black like one of those colors
I'm still getting used to this middle
part I like wear it seven days and I
parted like on the side other days and I
just like I don't know how I feel then
these pants I had to get here's you guys
know my best friend Abbi
she has camel pants and look at Abby has
camo pants I need camel pants so I got
camo pants and they're just like these a
camo like gene material and they have
cool little details right here I don't
know if that's called but it looks
really neato and then they just go whole
way down
camo jeans and I didn't have like any
camo pants so like I said I need pants
you can't tell I'm just so excited about
all of this this black leather jacket
fun fact I also have in like a white
cream color from honey bum but you can
never have enough black other jackets
you feel me girl if you're in college
you know I mean and you don't want to
get like crazy expensive ones for like
when you're going out and this one's
like not crazy expensive but it's also
like super super nice like it looks so
expensive and nice like literally girls
were complimenting me yesterday like
last night when I was wearing this it's
just so pretty and flattering
I love how it has like the flaps that
like open right there and just like the
zippers at the bottom and everything
guys you need this other jacket okay
girlfriend then this body suit is my
other option for as you can tell it is
quite revealing however I think it's so
fun for like going out and like why not
you know what I mean like you do you
like where it makes you comfortable
ooh and this black dress oh my gosh look
at it like sparkling Oh sequins I feel
like would be so good for like tea
parties or like for moles or like events
like that I love how it's like padded at
the top so golf right you don't need
aware of all this because there is
already pads in it not that I wear bras
ever anyway but whatever and then this
is just all like a mesh and like
see-through and then the bottom I also
like this to you because are you tall
ladies out there everything is too short
on you you know what I mean
look I'm 5 9 which isn't even like that
tall but everything you showed on me and
shows my butt but this does it like for
some reason it's like the perfect length
it's not too long but it's not too short
on me and it definitely is like the
perfect length in the back also has like
the mesh but then there's like little
crisscross details and guys this dress
is like it's so cute seriously if you
have any like events coming up where you
need like a little black dress but it's
like a little something special with the
sequined date party formal like highly
recommends you could get a two-piece low
set like this again this would be so
good for like a date part of your formal
it's like that really thick nice like
bandage material which I feel like is
just so flattering on everyone and I
love the cut of the skirt see how it
goes up like a little bit right there
it's like high-waisted so that you can
wear it with this tiny little tub which
is so fun you know you could also wear
this top with just like really
high-waisted jeans like a really high
waisted skirt short or something like
two pieces are the best cuz you can wear
them together or apart and like they're
just so versatile but this top is so fun
obviously super time you could also wear
it as like a bralette if you want to do
cuz thats a little it is just zippers up
the back so together you just look like
bangin you know what I mean already then
this little onesie what are these called
out bodysuit onesie I just thought it
was so different and unique than any
like bodysuit or even like top that I
have because it's not kind of this more
like coffee mocha
colors you can see like taupe but it's
like this thick ribs like knit material
and then it just obviously laces up on
the side and again it has like the
plunging neckline that I like
then I got this strapless off the
shoulder long sweater dress in how cute
is this I love it because it's off the
shoulder but like long sleeves so again
I think it just looks like really
elegant and cute and this is definitely
something I'd wear like to brunch with
like over the knee boot so we're like
booties and like so unique like I have
not seen a dress this style around like
anywhere oh what's the last thing
already
the last shirt I got from honey bun it's
just this short sleeve a little crop top
I'm obsessed with crop tops we've gone
over this before
okay never wear shirts that aren't
cropped I don't I don't know I don't
know I think as I like wearing
high-waisted things and then you wear
like crop things with high waisted
things and high waisted like jeans
leggings skirts shorts just like make
your legs look longer I feel like
they're just flattering anyway so this
stuff I just thought was so cute it just
says babe and I'm like this is just so
fun like fun little graphic tee you can
run out and about you can watch a lounge
around in so I really enjoy this and I
just thought it was really fun so yeah
that is everything I got from honey um
don't forget to use it Gretchen 20 for
20 percent off and honey button will be
linked down below so you can check it
out definitely TV pictures or like tag
me and in serum if you get the same
stuff as me and returning because
