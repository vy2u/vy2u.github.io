ones is another aviator type but with
black frames I like that I got one with
gold and on a plaque is that I have
options for like different effort that
I'm wearing you know when that parent
idea showed it was also like in
collaboration with Hilary Duff
so childhood me was screaming I was so
excited I saw that they were working
with Hilary Duff because I was like she
was only like my person for the first
like 15 years of my life okay and then
these sunglasses that I just thought
were super fresh like look at these I
like that since they're so affordable
you can kind of get like different
styles that you wouldn't normally get so
these are really nice why didn't I show
these first these are what I'm most
excited about
I got radians they have radians on there
guys they have so many different brands
of sunglasses radians and more these
kind of mind me on the side of the last
ones I just showed you
um but like obviously different in the
Arabians and I love how skinny it is on
the side and they're just so fresh then
I got these sunglasses to I think are so
different and I don't have any better

okay now I'm moving on to revolve see
you guys know I actually have these
exact Vince I'm gonna called the worn
Swede sneaker II thing and I have them
in like this beautiful taupe gray color
and I wear them literally all the time
and I actually had black Steve Madden
ones like these but they just weren't
the same like the Vince ones are just I
don't know so much better there's so
much more comfortable my Steve Madden
ones would give me blisters memories
comfortable and I was you know what I
wear them so much that it's worth it to
just get the Vince ones and even though
they're a bit pricey they were just like
perfect and I love them and I live in
them and they're so comfy and I just
really would recommend these oh wait did
I say revolve these three things I got
from shop up I'm pretty sure yeah
they're definitely shop up okay and then
this black beginning to you I'm not even
gonna bother a whole thing I'm to show
you right now cuz you can't tell but as
you can see on it's like super cute and
oh yeah I just saw it on there I just
thought it was a really fun black B
you different than what I currently have
him throw my soup Catherine uh made it
and then I got these 1tsp jean shorts
because I feel like I was really behind
I'm a trend and everyone else had them
and I didn't have them and I wanted them
for Aruba so I just got these things
they run a little big because I got a 27
and normally a 27 would fit me tighter
that make sense so I almost feel like
okay 226 or just know that I just feel
like they run big that's just what I
know about them so yeah okay so that was
chopped off and then I kind of went
crazy and I left the other day because
actually it's funny how it happened I
was facetiming Andy and I was walking
down Newbury because I was going to the
Boston Public Library and I go look at
my show we're like LF Brandi and she's
like what are you doing like go shopping
and I was like no I don't need to go do
homework and she's like no Gretchen like
elephant's having a sale right now I go
and I was like what so I went it
obviously was there for like hours this
first lap start you've seen all over my
Instagram I thought it was so cute in
the store I thought it was very
different than what I would normally
pick up so I thought it would try it out
and I really loved it
it's by the brand first-of-a-kind I've
never heard of that but it has like
these gold rose gold zippers so I think
that's really fun in I kind of went
skirt crazy so I love when the girls
that I laughs will come to your dressing
room and bring you stuff that you think
you might like and this was one of the
things and I was like keep it coming
girlfriend like how cute this royal blue
tight little skirt and like laces up and
down the sides I'm also gonna bring this
to a rubub right now for like nighttime
okay and then this I got specifically
for Aruba
probably the worst like the baby right
now I just ate breakfast I got this
white little romper and I thought it was
so cute it's by the brand seek the label
I think I've seen this label before I
thought it was really pretty and really
like tropical looking this I also got or
who huh you guessed it it's this white
I'm really like just stressed looking at
denim skirt and I just love this I love
how it buttons up the front like that it
is quite short in the front like very
short but then it gets way longer in the
back so that cover just brought
completely but I asked a girl I was like
you're gonna be able to see wait you
shouldn't be able to see it she was like
that you're good so I'm excited for that
last but not least this red top so cute
again I was one of the things that the
girl that was working there
brought to my dressing room and I was
Frick yeah it's just right a
long-sleeved top ties in the front
I love tops like this you're so cute and
she's like it's all so summery you know
I just love it
I know it's February but I'm really
excited for warm weather then from
SoulCycle
you guys already know I'm obsessed blah
blah blah whatever it's an obsession I
was leaving class in the morning and I
was like that pink sweatshirt is so cute
I like no pink sweatshirt I need it so I
just went ahead and got it and what I
realized during the days and I wish it
was cropped so I actually gonna go cut
it right now and then wear to the
airport because it's like so cute I just
wanted to be cropped I don't know why I
just feel that as I'm gonna go snip it
up real quick okay then if you guys know
butch in a second I got these great
brand new sweatpants and I've literally
been living in them I've been wearing
them every day I wear mine like a
million planes already I got these back
when I was in LA but I feel like I never
showed you guys and if I did already
show you in a hall that's embarrassing
but I don't think I did anyway I was
wearing them so much that I was like I
need to get a different pair of gray
sweatpants and I got these gray
sweatpants from soul cycle they're just
like really soft feeling they say soul
they have some stars my vibe total
cycles clothes is honestly way
overpriced but I like love them as a
company they're like literally my
favorite ever you guys know how obsessed
I am with them so I'm really willing to
pay anything because I'm obsessed with
them anyway
then from rainy mobo these two things oh
wait I should have this black tank top
from brandy melville - it's my closet
right now but I got it when we were
there no I got this Newport sweatshirt
why do I feel like I showed you guys
this already oh my god I think I did and
I'm really embarrassed well whatever
I think cuz I just realized that I wear
these every day and I was like did I
even talk about them that much because I
think I don't talk about them that much
but I literally wear them every day so
these are just their normal plain gray
Brandi sweat pants and I'm not too sure
you how much I wear them do you see how
like pill they're right there is that
supposed to happen I was like oh my god
is in a hole literally I worn them for
like weeks at a time so yeah I went at
first time I tried them on I was like I
cannot get these brand awful sweat pants
I am NOT like as skinny as their little
models that their clothes are made for
and they fit me like leggings but then
they like stretched out another like
comfy and cute so even if they're tight
on you get them anyway cuz they'll
stretch out promise
it's just like not flattering right now
