haul video for you guys and I know I
just posted my Black Friday haul but
these are some things that I have left
in Boston that I bought before I went
home at Black Friday so I just wanted to
show you guys what I've been getting in

been getting so many questions about so
let's just get on into it stuff I have
to show you is all from this app called

it's just this app and they have so much
stuff in here they have beauty they have
fashion they make up as you can see like
along the top beauty and makeup fashion

you guys always asked me my haul videos
Gretchen how do you make money in
college and how do you get money to get
trendy pieces so what I love about wish
is they have so many tiny pieces that
are really affordable

switched to a new one hopefully this is
still like working I don't know if it's
like better quality or worse quality let
me know but I was just about to show you
the first thing that I got from wish
which is just this huge brush that guys
I really like this big fan line and I
just got so much stuff from them because
literally it's so portable really good
for college kids and I just got some
fake eyelashes this I believe is a
concealer palette I'm gonna use this
look you know as like correcting
concealer it's a green and like yellow
to like cover up like redness and dark
circles and everything we got a shimmer
stick a bunch of jewelry necklaces
bracelets rings
a little makeup bag this I'm so excited
about their like little portable ones
and you can just fill it up with any
like big bottle you have and look at
like all my big bottles of perfume over
there we got some sunglasses some more
stuff some like gel eyeliner and I saved
the best for last my favorite so this is
just one of those like Waterproof
Speakers and this is so amazing I've had
one of these before actually I used to
have a pink one but I lost it and this
is gonna go great in my shower I love
like listening to music when I'm in the
shower so I'm so excited to it use this
and yeah so that is everything that I
got from the wish app and if you guys
want to start saving money and shopping
definitely check out the app listed in
the downbar
I showed these leggings and an apple to
the week video they're from Lululemon
and I was getting so many questions
about them guys are still commenting on
all my new videos like oh my gosh like I
can't find those legs anywhere boa pop
so basically I actually got these ah
splash marks they are from Lululemon
they came like brand new and the
obsession started with I was on Newberry
the other day and I was walking down the
street and I saw a girl wearing grey
cropped
leggings and they looked exactly like
this they were these leggings and they
have like black and like the pink
details and I just thought they were so
beautiful and so I went home and I went
on Google and I was searching like gray
crowd to Lululemon leggings like black
in pink and I was searching and
searching literally for like an hour and
I found like the style name of them and
I don't even know the name of this tile
but I just think they're so cute and I'm
so happy I got them so that is the deal
of these then I got this little lemon
shirt that I still haven't shown in a
whole video and it is this a bluish gray
short sleeve just like this is my
favorite type to workout in blue lemon I
forget the style name of this too but
it's just like their short sleeve dry
fit type shirt and that was actually
from Lululemon not like Poshmark where I
got my leggings this is also from the
actual store this is just a black
cropped tank top and I got it because my
friend Tom Schaad and I was obsessed
with it it's called the muscle of a crop
tank and I just really like you for
working out in and you can even wear it
click around to it and then this tank
top I actually got off of Poshmark as
well but it just says soul cycle its
from soul cycle and it came brand name
it like literally still have the tag on
it so I just think it's oq gray cropped
it's like actually really thick and it's
me so nice so just a couple more things
in his haul video it's kind of like
miscellaneous like I said just a bunch
of stuff I was picking up before I went
home for Thanksgiving break so got this
covergirl outlast stay brilliant gold
nail polish this is really funny because
I just showed you how I got some fake
eyelashes it from the wish app but I got
more so these are the kiss ever easy
lashes I literally bought them in bulk I
bought 10 on the internet because I
really wanted them and I heard that you
couldn't find them in store anymore and
you know the ones that I've just been
wearing like in all my videos that were
fake eyelash doesn't say that I wear
fake eyelashes everyone says that they
really like the way they look and that
they're like pretty natural ones so
that's really nice and I think they are
pretty natural looking they're not like
too intense so I really like these and
would recommend I like just started
wearing them like a week ago like I'm
still a newbie and don't even really
know how to put them on but I like these
aren't even this don't judge me I know
this came out like so long ago I feel
like well actually I know it did because
literally this is the Britney Spears
fantasy perfume and I just missed it to
be completely honest oh my gosh it
smells just this reminds me of my
childhood I'm not kidding I had this
like when I was little like growing up
and just smells so good it too like
girly and like sweet and I just really
missed this scent so I had to give this
perfume and the box is really pretty too
literally this is like my childhood like
in a nutshell this is my child
all right in the very last thing I have
to show you guys is just from support it
says fresh black tea instant perfecting
mask in this was actually on my
Christmas wish list but then I just
spoiled it for myself and went ahead and
bought it anyway because I wanted it
like now I didn't want to wait and yeah
I'm real excited to try this out I
talked about this in my Christmas
wishlist video but I watched Claudia so
loose key she talked about in her
favorites video and said how amazing it
was so I was like well if she likes it
I'm gonna like it and I need it so yeah
I literally just opened it for the first
time I don't even know what it looks
like but like so they just try this out
regardless and hopefully it's good
because it was really expensive so if I
can diamond leaves to some of these
things to link down below I will but
like a bunch like obviously these two
things I'm not able to find links to
sadly because they were like off
Poshmark and I bet they were sold at
soul cycle in women like a really long
time ago I'd have to be check out the
wish app listed in the downbar I think
it's such a great way to save on some
trendy items and just like anything that
you need shipped to you it's like so
convenient so yeah thank you so much for
watching this video and I'll see you the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
