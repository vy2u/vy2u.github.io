another winter haul for you in my last
haul video a lot of you were saying all
you do is haul videos anymore and I
really feel like I don't do that many I
mean a lot of stuff I've just been
getting recently I'm really I'd like
share with you guys so I just really
wanted to show you what I got
so the first thing I wanted to share
with you guys is actually this app that
I came across at this month and I really
liked the idea behind it but just looks
like this right there it's called cover
and it's a really simple app it's just
basically an app that like ensures your
belonging so you just like upload a
picture of it and it will insure it for
you even if you lose it by accident
which i think is so cool because I
always lose stuff so even if it's like
your phone and a selfie or like this
necklace I could insure which is so nice
because you look expensive jewelry like
some of my Tiffany stuff I definitely
want to do that for in case you lose it
and like right here after you make your
profile you can just select a category
to get a quote for your item and yeah
overall I just think it's a really great
idea to save you from those like scary
moments when you think you lost
something you're broke something and
I'll have it linked down below in case
you're interested alright the first
clothing store I have to show you guys
stuff from is Toby and I've been
obsessed with Toby's clothes recently
like I literally just go on their
website like every day I just look
through all their new stuff like if you
guys haven't like checked out Toby
online before their stuff is so cute
also I'm going to show you I'll have a
link down below so that you can find it
just like the style of their clothes is
so me and I just love everything it's so
like this I'm about to show you I'm like
so happy I got so this first little
upset I'm showing you it has this black
tank top as a top and I love it because
it's like scalloped on the bottom and it
simmers up the back and in this skirt is
like tight the same material as the top
scalloped on the bottom and it zips up
the back as well I mean look so it's so
cute on you can see like a little bit of
your stomach in between or at least with
me you can because I'm like really tall
you guys saw on my snapchat my snapchat
is that Gretchen you can follow me v
ends at the end by the way I posted a
picture of this the other day because
when I tried it on I just thought it was
so cute and Lucy actually helped me pick
this out so Thank You Lucy for
influencing me to get this because I
love it it'll be super good for going
out just kidding I don't go however and
the next thing I
toby is just this skirt it seriously so
adorable I love the fit of it it's just
black with this floral print on it
that's like gray and white I do not have
any skirt like this and it'll be really
good for my business classes and its
might be funny that I got tights online
but I just got a pair of plain black
tights from Toby because I just didn't
have like any black tights like I ripped
them really easily and figured out that
I didn't have any and I need them when I
dress up so these are gonna be really
handy and then the other two dresses I
got are like sitting right over there
and I just don't feel like getting them
because I'm really lazy but the person I
got is just this maybe blue dress and it
seriously so pretty I love the way it
fits and I love like the details across
the stomach and it cuts kind of low in
the front and then this light pink one I
got I seriously feel like a ballerina
when I wear it it's so pretty made my
roommate call it like the ballerina
dress she thinks it so pretty too and I
love it because the sleeves are just
flowy like that and the whole back is
open like guys the back is like
beautiful so that is all I got from Toby
and like I said if you are interested
I'll have it linked down below and then
from moon cats I know I've shown it to
stuff from their before usually I get
like scarves and stuff but this time I
got this sweater cuz it's like all
cashmere
I'll have this link down below too in
case you're interested in you want to
like find it it's really really soft
guys it's so soft pullover sweater and
it has like a little V I'm gonna wear it
with dark wash jeans and booties and
either a denim button-up shirt
underneath or like a plaid shirt you
know you can see the collar over top in
this box just came in the mail like
seconds before I started filming I just
ordered a couple things from Sephora I
thought I would show you I got a bunch
of like mini things and like samples
just to try out new things
I got renewed hope in a jar a little
mini like face moisturizer and I really
like philosophy like the company like
Pier do you guys know is like my
favorite face wash everywhere from there
and then I'm a trying out the Estee
Lauder advanced night repair eye cream
I've been wanting to try like a new eye
cream I'm also trying the origins high
potency night renewal cream so I think
this is just like a face cream this is a
goal of sample night and then I got the
mini NARS audacious
audacious my famous dashes oh it's just
this little mascara from NARS excited to
try that out
I got a mini ultra Repair hydrating
serum oh this is the first aid beauty
one I think I've showed this in a home
before I got like a bigger one before
and I love the
stuff everything too cheap to actually
buy the real one so it's good that I
have this little one because I already
know I love this stuff that I'm trying
the boscia I say it bozhe the purifying
cleansing gel and the Clinique foaming
sonic facials dope all that was just
like samples probably some of that I got
with you know like your points with
Sephora like I think this look Estee
Lauder eye cream I got 100 points right
250 points or something cuz I bunch of
those points saved up but I'm gonna
things actually bought I bought gimme
brow which is just benefits tinted brow
gel and I thought it would be bigger
I like sought the other day in Sephora
after I ordered it online and the
full-size is literally only this big
like that's not that big and I kind of
wish it came in a bigger one and this I
literally fell in love with I went in to
support the other day and I was talking
to the girl there I was telling her how
I wanted like a new under eye concealer
and she recommended this Tarte
high-performance Naturals maracuja is
how you say it
creaseless concealer blah blah blah and
she helped me pick out the shade light
for me because I knew I wanted like a
lighter one to go under my eyes because
I really like to like bright under I
look right now I'm not I'm not really
doing it but I love what other people do
it I always think it's super pretty so
light is like very very pale like it's a
lot lighter than my skin tone I was
scared it's gonna be a little too light
but I think it'll be good because it'll
be nice and highlighting didn't you put
this on me in the store I was like woah
like my eye circles were gone so I
already know I'm gonna love this then
waiting for it to come in the mail then
the last thing I got is just this NARS
blush and bronzer do you guys know they
have like some of my favorite blushes
and bronzers it's so cute and it has
like my favorite colors in it has Laguna
and orgasm I think that is yeah and
these are like my favorite of all time
like blush and bronzer from NARS it's
like this little baby Universal
packaging and this will be really good
when I travel it's just so little is
everything I got from Sephora I ordered
on Vineyard Vines like earlier this
weekend it already came I wanted to get
Justin a Valentine's Day present he told
me he wanted this navy blue shirt from
Vineyard Vines I don't let unab seeing
this but I'll probably see ya after
Valentine's Day anyway and it's just his
navy blue long sleeve shirt and it has a
little pink way on the back and says
Vineyard Vines just like the classic
long sleeve so and then
thanks obnoxious I decided I'd get the
same line but in white so we can be two
wins well like not exactly twinning
because if I got the navy blue and two
we probably hate me because it would be
looking exactly the same so I just got
that long-sleeve white one again it has
the light pink whale on the back it says
Vineyard Vines and then you know in
stores you have to like spend a certain
amount to get free shipping I like hate
paying for shipping so I decided I would
buy a bunch of these like vineyard by
little pink whale stickers but Justin
like stickers so I'll just give these to
him I still didn't really hit them
minimal I don't even remember how much
money it was but I had to like spend a
certain amount so I decided I would get
myself a little nightie and you like
wear Nikes when you were like a little
girl at always my 90s it's just like
this pretty light blue color and it kind
of looks like a butt and I'm sure that
like your dad would wear weren't about
last night it was really comfortable I
really like it just like this little
mighty dress and it was on sale don't
worry I didn't pay like that much for it
the very last thing I have to show you
is actually this dress that I'm wearing
right now I can tell it's a dress but
now you can see it on and it shows these
long-sleeve it crazy dress it has some
really cool like black leather details
at the top and it's actually from
Abercrombie &amp;amp; Fitch believe it or not I
like saw it in there recently and I was
like woah that is so cute it's like out
of my comfort zone I gotta get it
because I gotta like step up my fashion
game that is all I have it for my winter
clothing and other products haul thank
you so much for watching and I'll see
you my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
