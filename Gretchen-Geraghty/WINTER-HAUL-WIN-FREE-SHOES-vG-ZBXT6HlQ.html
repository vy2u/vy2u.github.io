haul video for you just how I look some
shoes and clothes that I bought recently
that I wanted to share with you I'm so
excited to be filling and like sitting
down right now I'm talking to you guys
like filming a video because I haven't
done this and so long I think probably
the last time was my Christmas haul
video since I've been in Aruba I just
got back two days ago and so it feels
really good it's like sit down and film
a video and just talk to you and I
missed it and like I obviously love
logging but yeah before I talk too much
we're just gonna get into it the winter
home video so the first four things I
have to show you are shoes they're all
these Steve Madden shoes and I'm so
excited because Steve Madden shoes are
my favorite shoes for those of you guys
like watch my videos for a while pretty
much all my shoes are Steve Madden I
would say so all of them are from this
website called zushio anju shoes like
such a cool website I'm so happy I found
it because they have a bunch of like
Steve Madden shoes and it's really great
too because on Steve Madden a lot of
times like the sizes and colors will
sell out but like then you can look at
ndu shoe and they have them there and
there's like a whole bunch of different
brands it's definitely a great website
if you love shoes like me I will have
all of these shoes and I'm about to show
you link down below so you can check
them out and also you have a chance to
win a free a pair of shoes a lucky three
of you will win a pair of shoes
so yeah it's linked down below and even
if you don't win you can get 15% on
first year I'm going to show you are my
favorite I just got these nude high
heels
and I have one other pair of like new
high heels but they're like rounded in
the front so I thought these were super
cute and these are a lot skinnier to
than the ones I have they're like are
these called stilettos oh my gosh
correct me if I'm wrong but I think like
the skinnier they are or something
that's what they're called I really
don't even know I don't have that many
else at all go into toe and they are the
throat ohh
blush Lee type if you are interested and
I mentioned it like a vlog before by
major before was biology but now I've
changed it to business and hopefully I
like it and stick with it and for the
business school at BU we have to dress
up a lot for the presentation so I will
definitely be needing some more fancy
heels so that's why a bunch of these are
heels so you know and then the next
shoes I got also from Steve Madden are
just these nude flats and I really like
dude shoes because they just go with
like everything and these are just some
pointy toe new flats and I really like
them too because there's like a space
right there it's just like different
than other new flats I have and these
are in the type illusion and then I
think the color is natural so if you're
interested like I said fourth awesome
from Steve Madden are just these black
high heels and these ones are like
really really high trying to bond and I
might have trouble walking in them to be
honest and these will be good for like
night occasions and they're a little
more dressy I probably wouldn't wear
them like to class or anything and I
think those are like patent materials so
they're like shiny and I just like the
design of how they're all at crisscross
you like that and also I'm five nine so
these make me like super super tall like
probably over six foot because these are
some pretty high heels they're in the
kind Stella black patent and the last
pair I got are like so cute and these
are by Madden girl Lucy is Madden girl
like a branch of Steve Madden yeah I
think Madden girl is just like a
category of Steve Madden I don't really
know someone of you can like tell me
down below if you want to I know but
these are so cute I love these I
remember my friend Julia at homecoming
had black like lace appeals and ever
since and I've wanted a pair like that
because I thought they were so cute I'm
so happy I finally got the I just think
they look so fierce you like lace all
the way up and these are pretty high too
and they're just so awesome they're so
cool I don't know I'm just gonna wear
them all in channel making occasion to
wear them and their style name is racy I
guess so I love all those shoes and like
I said before zoo shoe is like so
awesome name so many cute shoes on their
website so I really like their website a
super lot I have it linked down below
Hey more shoes I love shoes guys so what
Justin got me for Christmas since I
couldn't show it at my Christmas haul
video since I filmed it like Christmas
morning and then I got my presents from
him like later Christmas Day he got me
these ivory elephants and I was like
freaking out when I got them they're so
cute they're just like this really
pretty turquoise and green color which
is my favorite colors coming nails right
now sorry they're kind of chipping don't
pay attentions at all these elephants
and they're like darker purple at the
bottom and then light purple and then
like the teal color
they kind of like fade and I wore them
so much in a rowboat say Audrey L on the
bottoms and I'm so happy I got
and then Justin got me this yellow ivory
Ella hat with like the blue elephant and
it says ivory Ella on the back and you
guys know if you watching my blog I
literally almost started crying when I
got this because I was like freaking out
because I wanted this for so long and
it's just so and then Justin got me this
outfit necklace funny I'm wearing a
little silver elephant on right now this
is from Nordstrom too by the way you
guys like oh he's asked he got me this
it kind of looks blue but it's really
like an opal color I think so it kind of
changes depending on like the lighting
and I don't even really know but
sometimes just like a turquoise II like
blue just like shiny color and it's so
cute look I've been wearing it so much
and the last thing it Justin got me are
these purple plaid pj pants I wanted
them so bad and I always would talk to
him about it how I wanted these purple
PJ pads so I was like so happy and I got
these to you because he like convinced
me that he like didn't get them for me
but I was so happy then I'll show you
Justin's family got me like pretty much
dozens mom because she just knows me so
well I seriously love everything she got
me she got me this big jarred candy
first of all which was done in like a
day and then she got me this out of it
oh oh my gosh I just got so happy like
thinking about it like look at it guys
just look at it guys it's just this
really cute elephant mug and it's big
too which I like so that you can like
fill it up with a bunch of chocolate or
tea or ice cream if you want ice cream
in a mug I don't know let's see me
always do that it tastes better that way
I'm not even kidding
you just try it I just came in a bug
it's really good anyways it's also
really cool about this it's not only
that it has a cute little elephant face
and little elephant like feet on it is
that it has like a spot in the top of
his head so that you can put your tea
bag in it like once you stop like
steeping your tea isn't that when it's
cold I think I think you can just put
the tea bag right there it's just so
cute and I know she got it from Urban
Outfitters if you are interested and
then they just know I love elephants so
much like oh my goodness she got me this
silver little elephant and guess what it
does guys it's so that you can put your
rings on his trunk look it's a little
ring holder and I didn't even have
anywhere to put my rings she like read
my mind I don't know how she knew I
needed one of these but it's so cute I
think she said she got that from
Francesca's and then she got me a bunch
of tea to go with my elfin mug and she
knows I love to eat but tea she got me
are all from David's tea and I'm super
excited to try them
out she got me banana nut bread peanut
butter cup you guys know I love bananas
and peanut butter and she said she's
thinking acted like you mix them
together so to be like bananas and
peanut butter and then she I me
gingerbread cookie this is Coco mint
cream I'm so excited to try these out
because I didn't really have time to
since right after Christmas we left for
Aruba but I've been at home I'm
definitely gonna try them out and she
got me a bunch of tea filters obviously
to like put the tea in and she also got
me this big bottle of like liquid like
cane sugar I think and that's usually
what she uses to make her teas and
whenever she's made me tea with it it's
like so good so I'm so happy she at me
that so that my tea can taste as good as
her teeth and then I was so excited to
get this she got me this via Bradley
makeup organizer and it's one of the
hanging up once and I still have a bunch
of stuff in it because I'm only like
halfway unpacked from Aruba so far this
is like so handy-dandy and I seriously
think everyone needs one of these
because I literally was struggling
without this for so long like I can
never even fit my makeup or toiletries
in a bag like before I had this so this
is so great and also some of them are
like little waterproof sections which is
good because my shampoo spilled on the
way down so it's a very handy also it
folds up which is like so convenient so
then you just hold it like that
I'm gonna I'm gonna heavily go bang then
I'm gonna show you the stuff that my
friend Taylor I made for Christmas
because she gave me it on Christmas Day
after I filmed my Christmas haul video
so the first thing she taught me are
these fuzzy socks and they're like my
favorite fuzzy socks ever not only are
they soft on the outside but they're
like uber soft on the inside and you
guys know I look purple my room is
purple and then she got his his candle
and it smells so good it's amaretto
vanilla oh my gosh she's a miss cute
little mason jar love this she got us
his Kate Spade necklace and it came in
this little bag like how cute is that
first of all and this necklace is so
adorable I'm obsessed it's just like
this little like gold nah and it's so
simple I just love it little simple
necklaces like this and like simple
jewelry so this is so cute and I
seriously love it Taylor and this I was
like freaking out about because this is
one of my favorite scents ever it smells
so good and I've been like holding off
on buying it because it's expensive so
like thank you so much Taylor she got us
the philosophy amazing grace little set
I remember my aunt would always have
aunt Chris you smell really good you
know it's had the amazing grace perfume
if you don't have it like seriously just
like go to Sephora so that you can smell
it it also comes with the amazing grace
like shower gel body cream oh so happy I
got that thank you so much Taylor and
then if I was away in Aruba Lucy went to
the city and went shopping I was just
gonna show you the stuff that she got
because it's like really cute and
usually we share a lot of our clothes
and this first rates from brandy
melville and just his forest green short
sleeve shirt I mean super soft and I
really like that you got this at
long-sleeve black shirt from brandy
melville it just has all these like
ribbed details and it's super cute and
she also has it in grey so we like this
shirt we already know join two Lululemon
it wouldn't be a glv haul video without
Lululemon what have you commented that
on one of my hauls before and I was like
you know me so well try this like bright
blue tank top it's so beautiful and she
got on sale just get so much it was just
guys can't even freaking believe it it
was only $29 I don't even know how she
found this for so cheap but I don't even
know if it was on sale but it's like
beautiful and it's the cool racerback
tank top style I didn't even have to
look at the tag I just knew that as soon
you know you're obsessed I really know
the names of like all their stuff it's
like kind of sad and they're just like
stretchy and really good for working out
and then the last three shirts I have to
show you I just got in Aruba so this
first one I'm pretty sure I'm going to
keep for myself it's just like this
purple one that says Aruba and I really
just like t-shirts for like working out
and managing around and sleeping usually
I think all of them will see me might
share like I wasn't really sure since I
just got three so this one is so cool in
Aruba I don't know they have in other
places but they have this store called
del Sol and everything from there like
lights up when you wear it in the Sun so
it's so cool like things like it color
when they don't have color like I don't
know if that makes sense but this is
just a white t-shirt and it says the
Caribbean Aruba right there and then the
back is just a map of the Caribbean
which I thought was so cool and if you
wear it out in the Sun it like lights
off wait let me see if I can hold it in
front of the window and it'll work
okay sail it's really cloudy and dark
out right now so it's not working but
like when it's signing out this like
lights up and it's like a really pretty
colored map in the front like what I'm
saying like that I mean like it gets
color and it gets color right there too
this is like such cool shirt and I'm
super happy I got that and I just
thought this gray Aruba t-shirt kind of
like that purple
but it's just great okay I feel like
this hall video didn't even have that
much stuff I just talked like forever so
I'm sorry I know this is long but thank
you guys so so much watching and I'll
see you next video
