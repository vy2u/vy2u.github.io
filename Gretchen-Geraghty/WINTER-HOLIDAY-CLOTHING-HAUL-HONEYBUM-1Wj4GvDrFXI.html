everyone so today I have a honey bun
Omaha video for you guys and I feel like
I've been going all crazy and we all
know I'm obsessed with clothes so what's
new yeah literally everything I got is
so cute oh wait before I forget to
mention if you use the code Gretchen 20
you can get 20% off of everything on
honey bun their whole website so you're
welcome definitely go utilize that and
Before we jump into it can I be really
annoying and can you guys go follow me
on instagram please like actually go
follow me because I've been so says what
it's Graham I literally post a million
times day because I just like love
Instagram it's just so fun to be able to
like share my life instantly with you
guys if that makes sense cause like
YouTube I'm filming this video I'm gonna
edit it and everything and it's gonna go
up like a couple days well like
Instagram is like I literally get to
share my life with you like right as
it's happening okay and that's liver
bladder Gretchen the first item I got is
I'm not kidding when I say this actually
the softest thing I think I've ever
owned actually like my roommates were
freaking out they were like oh my god
very very soft like guys just literally
a blanket like I Lily will like cuddle
watch Netflix with it it's just the
fuzziest jacket of all time and I feel
like these fur jackets have been so in
and I tried on a boutique in Burlington
and I was like you know what I never
thought I'd look at jacket like this but
now I really need one and this is
perfect and it's long-sleeve a white top
I got it just like this beautiful lace
material it goes up around your neck
like that's a little bit more
high-necked and then as the flurry outie
sleeves which are so in right now and
are just so adorable I love that top - I
like loved crop tops like my memory
tailor was like do you ever wear shirts
alike are cropped I feel like most of my
tops are cross because you can wear so
many bonds with their echoey like cute
high-waisted skirt with a a Corky wide
waisted pants shorts the list goes on
and on and this top very surprised it's
cropped my big mad lady is here the
other day and I tried on a wheel this
top is so adorable
it's like it's this beautiful taupe
color that I love it just crosses a
friend like that it's super soft and it
is pretty cropped
you see how it goes it like upper thick
cuts a pretty high so now that's pretty
cropped in you have to wear like very
high waisted things
that I'm so bad at scrapping clothes I'm
gonna stop now this jacket I actually
think is really funny I really enjoy it
because if you can tell it's like
off-the-shoulder denim jacket I feel
just so trendy and right now and I see
so many people on Instagram being like
look at me in my fab denim jacket it's
like off my shoulders oh and I think
it's funny is like can't you just take a
normal denim jacket and put it off of
your shoulders but this is obviously
like made for it so I don't know I just
think it's funny I think it's really
cute though really trendy and I would
recommend if you're looking for out
off-the-shoulder denim jacket then this
top I got it's like this sparkly shiny
rose gold it's kind of like a knit top
once again tank top super nice for
layering for the holidays I love like
shiny materials like this for the
holidays like like it's just so in sorry
if I'm being annoying with my ponytail
right now I took this whole video I was
like playing with it I like never really
put my hair up and it's just been really
fun I've been like flipping people with
my ponytail day hey but I also enjoy
like this is like very nitpicky a little
but I really like that like the material
the whole shirt continues like on the
straps like it's all just one continuous
thing like it never like breaks I'm so
weird I'm really so weird and I use on
my last haul video you know pretty much
everything in there was velvet and this
top is also velvet and it's also really
I have it right here
hahaha remember this like purple ma be
like choker dress I show from bos oh
this reminds me so much of it it's a
little bit more purple but it's just
beautiful like really elegant tank top
it kind of drapes like that and then
it's all like open in the back I just
feel so like fabulous when I wear this
then it can I be completely honest so
some of those things I tried on before
and like more like that off the shoulder
taupe cropped little sweater I wore the
fuzzy jacket of course because that's my
new favorite thing that I own but some
of these things I haven't wonderly tried
on yet and this I've been turned on yet
I picked it out so obviously it's gonna
like be cute it looks good on line but
now I'm just really confused how it
works
I think these long things obviously just
like tie in the front just probably like
a little wrap cute chiffon top it's just
like this tan kind of nude color I love
this sleeves like I love that they're so
like fluffy and flowy look at it is so
sequiny and shimmery and I literally got
this for years like I got four years and
if you know me you know I love plunging
really open talks that show
your boobs because yeah okay but I love
like the plunging neckline I just think
it's like so fierce and the back is like
completely open obviously and this is
just like the cutest bodysuit and will
be the best for like going on the
holidays New Year's like expect a
million pictures on Instagram and this
New Year's all right the last couple
things they got reminding them I thought
I'd try something new because I don't
really have anything like these I got
three like sets but they're different
than matching sets I currently have okay
so this first one are we surprised is
that mom purple pinky velvet color
because clearly I'm obsessed in the top
I just thought was so cute this is like
what initially drew me towards this set
because I love that it just kind of
crosses like that in the front little
drapey detail it's like really soft like
a little crop top
obviously supercops to almost look at
bando you could wear it really really
Army's it's up but then it comes with
this kind of like MIDI bodycon velvet
skirt and together it's just like it's
so fierce and like I don't know like
this trend is just so cool and new and
I'm really excited to try it but then
this is like a little scandals I love it
it came together like this you can like
to see you it's like but it's just like
this red suede like structure kind of
banjo looking tank top that goes with
this skirt which is again like body con
sweet I love it like laced up on the
side I just thought it was so intriguing
like you had an ex-boyfriend that you
wanted to make jealous okay anyone would
just look so like dang it on this like
banging on a budget okay this last thing
I got again just super sequiny because
of why not can I say a little matching
to be set the really cropped tank top
lately is it like a crotch and sure if
it's not caught but this is obviously so
cop so fun wait literally I could wear
this for years to I'm just more sequin
to everything's like the whole week of
like Christmas and New Year's and then
the skirt to go with I just love this
matching side so cool together
so sequiny and I like these sequins
because they're like it sounds so crazy
I like these you can because they're
like soft sequins that make any sense
any of you
whoo Italy is like I don't know like
they're not like pokey harmful obnoxious
sequins they're like soft subtle sequins
they're like a matte finish I look way
too far into these things but I really
enjoy this okay so that is everything I
did to show you guys from honey mom but
don't forget you can use it Gretchen 24
24 south or whole website you guys
