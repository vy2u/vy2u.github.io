title of this video this is just going
to be my night routine for 2017 I
figured went onto this video since I did
my morning routine for 2017 the other
day and I was like well rich and it only
makes sense to do my nighttime routine
plus I know I love watching that time
routine videos in this video is always
requested him believe it 2017 already
and also this video is super exciting
for me because I'm partnering with
Neutrogena for this video thank you so
much Eugenia for sponsoring this video
if you guys know me you know that I love
did you know I'm always using their
cleansers and moisturizers and a piece
on my last skincare routine video you
know that I've been trying out their
light therapy acne masks for over a
month now and what I dug out guys
actually save the original box so I
could show you guys so you can see what
the packaging looks like so you can pick
it up and I'm going to talk about this
more later on but essentially it's just
so affordable it's so easy to use and it
works so I'll have Neutrogena light
therapy acne mask link down below if you
guys are interested you should
definitely go check it out it's
available at Walmart in the acne
skincare aisle so without further ado
let's get on to my nighttime routine so
tonight I was just out to dinner with
some friends it was really nice and
snowy outside so that was so fun like
when it's snowing it just brings me so
much joy who is with me so then we get
home and I try to pet Teddy but he
ignores me runs away and then I'm just
heading my way upstairs to start getting
on ready for the night I was so tired
after a long day and our dinner was
really nice and it's kind of far so I
was just so tired I don't want to hop
into my bed I had like a million pillows
everywhere
my shrink it's really dark out but first
I'm going to magically change into my
PJs there's a super comfy mint green
fuzzy sweatshirt I got recently and some
pink sweatpants because it doesn't
matter if you don't match if you're just
at home going to bed you don't I mean
then under storing my hair up in a bun
and I'm using the cleaning clear makeup
dissolving wipes to make sure I get all
my makeup off and get my skin it really
clear look at how much makeup is left
over on that wipe it is so crazy
and then I'm just washing my face with
this orange Neutrogena cleanser I've
been using it forever you can do took
almost gone because I want my skin to be
super clear before I use my light
therapy acne mask now I'm just sitting
in my bed and my wallet was there and
this is what my skin looks like before I
use the acne mask it's not bad at all
it's actually been getting a lot better
after using it for a month so when you
get your light therapy acne mask it
comes with the Neutrogena 30-day light
therapy acne mask activator which is
what makes the mask work and what I love
about it is you only leave it on ten
minutes every day so it's just a time
for me to chill at night take some
snapchats you should definitely add me I
always send funny pictures to my friends
and sometimes may get my story and then
I just go on Instagram and Twitter
should follow me on there I love going
through my Instagram I'm look absurd and
I always see cute couple pictures and I
die like seriously look at Ava and Adam
they are just so cute and then I just
saw this picture on Lorne Elizabeth's
Instagram and it reminded me because it
was just a page from milk and honey and
I actually read all of this book the
other day but it's just one of my
favorites so there's one of my favorite
poems that you can read for yourself
it's just one of the best and I just
love reading through here a lot of days
of our time that's the best ever
don't forget it ladies rebo poem and
then I'm just gonna go on my computer to
edit some videos which is pretty typical
I do that like every night for a while
and since I've already been using my
mask for 30 days I actually just bought
another activator from Walmart and
technically since you use it for a month
it's only 50 cents a day guys know that
I have acne prone skin so it's so nice
to be able to use this light therapy
acne treatment used to only be offered
at look at dermatologists office like so
expensive but this one's just easy to
use and at home and obviously allows me
to multitask and a couple more fun facts
about the mask is that its chemical free
fda-cleared
and it's not hot because I remember I
was kind of nervous before I started
trying it out but it would be hot but
it's not hot at all and don't forget it
will be a link down below in case you
are interested so once I'm done
scrolling through my YouTube comments I
forgot to lay my candle lifehack I
couldn't find my lighter for my candle
and actually another fun fact for all of
high school I wasn't allowed to light
candles my room because my dad didn't
trust me at the candles strong enough
it'll still smell good so you don't
really need a lighter again the purple
wine bar
ah the joys of being a twin I'm kidding
I Love Lucy but even you're 19 sharing
can be hard so you guys saw me at
moisturize my face and now I'm just boys
rising my body I'm going to try as my
legs to but I had to take off my pants
so you didn't see that part and then I
just brushed my teeth
pretty self-explanatory and I'm
literally such a noob I still floss like
every night so I just show that and I
wear my retainers yes I'm 19 and I still
wear my retainers but dental health is
like really important to me so yeah I'm
just very serious about that so then I
just plop down onto my bed go on my
phone a bit and I'm going to be drinking
some more water because water is so
important and then I'm just obviously so
that was it for my nighttime routine
