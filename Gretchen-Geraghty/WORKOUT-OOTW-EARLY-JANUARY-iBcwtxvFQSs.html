those are the only ones I brought home
for branch because this was filmed over
break on a sketch out at my house so
today I just did my eyebrows I don't
wear makeup that much when you go to the
gym especially if I'm just going to the
gym but if I already have makeup on
Jimmy J if I work out later and I will
so I'm just wearing my high-waisted
Lululemon Wonder unders and then I'm
wearing this white tank top from the
women and I was showing you my sports
bra which is rama victory secret all
right go on Wednesday I'm just wearing
this rowing change top I believe I'm
wearing these black Lululemon shorts my
blog lemons for underneath and you and

wearing big eyelashes because i sona's
all day so i should serve my hair
ponytail and then came balcony wedding
secrets normally I try to go to the gym
in the morning you'll see when I'm back
at school I go to the gym in the morning
before class but a home will for break
some days I worked out a few minutes
outside Nick upon those days and this
morning it was after yoga and I was like
it's so dead I was really tired and I
was really sweaty too so lol ooh my best
top is just from a gym shark and my
shield for thought some lemon my black
leggings are also from jin sharks they
kind of match I like no workout clothes
so I brought home over break so kind of
funny ounces and I felt like sort of
uncomfortable of my stomach showing at
hot yoga but you know is whatever and
literally those like my new favorite
leggings ever you guys know I always
have that gym charge students down below
again I'm wearing my highly fit of black
wonder unders because like I said I
brought home like no workout clothes I
just had to keep washing them and re
wearing them and that's really helpful
when you're getting sore and then I'm
just wearing this great changeup from
Lululemon

weren't earlier in the week losing
Lululemon Sports Raj which is cool green
line mine's like just in my eyebrows

always use those purple headphones that
I love but I always lose them I think I
literally lost them the next day so it's
so sad alright then for Saturday are we
surprised same logging don't worry when
I get back to school I'll have a lot
more working

you with the same clothes I'm just
wearing this bad Lululemon short sleeve
shirt I love working out and shirts
women women I'm in today Airmen were to
take off my favorite year my necklace
usually I just work out with the arm
which I know is probably bad but when I
bike especially it'll light down so much
it might make her my necktie remember to
take it off because I was just like
today I'm gonna put on it this one one
minute gray headband right I get so
sweaty so it helps and I absolutely
dripping down my face you know and I'm
gonna show you these Under Armour socks
