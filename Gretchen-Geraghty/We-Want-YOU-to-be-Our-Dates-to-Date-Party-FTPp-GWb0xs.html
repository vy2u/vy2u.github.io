looking for Dave horny Dave definitely
get out perform good morning guys
so it is plenty after 11:00 and I slept
- like a legend in it and I was just
about to tell Taylor at the lay back but
I had to share it you guys so this is my
life back
sleep in a sports bra because then
you'll work out in the morning like
actually and like I always liked working
out in the morning anyway but then if I
like I'm in a sports bra it like really
pushes me cuz I already am wearing way
athletic clothes anyway you know I'm
saying so just give me the most
perplexed look she was like as I'm like
normally I'm like way too hot if I'm
wearing like a shirt like a long-sleeve
shirt I've noticed not like at home but
like here my room is like toasty so then
I have like nightmares and I'm like
sweating so that it's just better to
sleep in sports but anyway I like really
enjoy going in the morning like
yesterday I went like six am but now
it's like 12 I ran by the river
yesterday maybe I'll go to the gym today
um you run really fast Taylor no you
always say that I need to go at like a
10-minute mile pace I didn't run in like
a hundred years Taylor runs like that
guy on the track right there that's what
you always say slow for you is like a
seven minute pace that's how Taylor runs
everyone she runs that fast so I am
finally going to the gym and me saying
in yesterday's vlog that I'm gonna get
up at 6 a.m. every day and like run by
the river obviously it was a total fail
today but in reality I do plan on doing
that like most days if I can get myself
to bed early enough and make sure I'm
getting enough sleep because like even
when I did yesterday then I before I
probably slept like five and a half six
hours like I went to bed Julie um but
ideally I would just be going to bed
earlier so I need to do that but then
last night after my exams like I
literally left it like almost 10:00
that's a good hour exam ended them and I
need to come back and like unwind and
like watch some of the clips I'm like
obsessed with the Twilight series again
like I've definitely seen every single
one but like back in the day when I
first came out so like I'm just watching
all of them and it's very underrated I
think I like loved the movies anyway so
you guys should watch them again because
Mandy was watching them last week when I
was visiting her she can like watch
movies at the same time that she does
her homework which I don't know how
because I can't focus but she was
watching Twilight movies watching them
again so I was watching that tool really
late last night and then I was like 1
a.m. and I was like so tired so I fell
asleep in I slept 11 so I'm finally
going to the gym I just need to be like
productive and then I'm gonna come back
shower get ready I really want to film
the video because family video just puts
me in the best mood and I like love
filming at videos especially haul videos
clips like new clothes I get so excited
about and I've been meaning to ship
clothes for a while and then I'll
finally study for finance in QM because
those are my two core midterms tomorrow
5 to 9 again not looking forward to it
but after I'm really excited cuz Friday
we have like a day off of class and then
Mandy's coming so excited I'm just
covering my differential yes enjoy it
sister is freshman here at BU Jen it's
just gonna be really good today with
everyone and then Saturday for my
sorority here Alfea we have red dress
brunch in the morning which is for our
philanthropy the American Heart
Association so I'm so excited it's gonna
be so great I just bought my bronzer by
the way if I look behind you because I
feel like I kind of do a little bit cuz
I like don't wear makeup when I work out
but I just put bronzer all over coz I
like about really pale yeah I'm weird
when the corners behind
sitting over there in the dining hall
yeah we something about okay so guys
I've been very bad at studying I was at
the dining hall for like literally over
an hour with my pals because sometimes
and no means of stress like this with
midterms you just gotta hang out with
your buddies and do you stress it but
but right now I actually am taking a
practice exam promise for finance and
then I plan on learning human tomorrow I
can't wait for me to come this weekend
that is just so it's like getting me
through this while I have to face in her
back actually but yeah I think I'm just
gonna combine today and tomorrow because
today was kind of morning and I've been
getting it much footage because I've
been doing literally nothing good
morning guys meri getting eggs my core
day literally these two exams say you're
about to kill me but it's okay because
when sir over there over I woke up quite
early this morning a bit before 7:00 to
read my finance textbook and know what I
learned I know a lot less but I thought
I did I was like finance is easy like I
know finance when I was reading around
like how come I don't know what these
definitions are and then like I started
to take the practice exam and I'm like
what does this mean like the practice
exam we took in class versus the
practice exam they both are online are
so different normalized
so whatever I'm just gonna work through
that today I find anything QM and then
QM I haven't even started saying core
but that's to come
alright guys so this is matt hojae no
it's okay
it's goes on her channel really yeah
alright so tell me what you think about
what you think about the core midterms
so far give me the low low nose
merchants definitely get a helper so
we're here at Duncan
Gretchen hit us up at four in the
morning last night asking to help her on
studying I'm joking but we've been
studying since early this morning
it never stops and Finance
