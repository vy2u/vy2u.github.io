showing you what I eat in a day it's
actually everything that I ate yesterday
so there's like breakfast lunch dinner
with some snacks and yeah this has been
requested a lot since my last one and I
also want to address in my last one
there's a lot of negativity I don't know
why that is some of you were saying wow
you don't eat enough at all look you're
an athlete eat more and some of you are
saying wow you need so much you're a pig
and you're fat so I really don't know
where I went wrong with that video but
it made me kind of sad reading those
negative comments if you have something
like constructive criticism that's
totally fine but just don't try to like
be really mean because accepted my
feelings well I also want to address I
remember some of the comments that like
you don't even showing all the candy and
junk food you eat and like yes once in a
while I will eat junk food and all the
ice cream and stuff but like yesterday I
didn't I usually try to be pretty
healthy I'll eat ice cream maybe like a
few times a week but I try to eat mainly
pretty healthy like I have been having
junk food today and mostly like fruits
and vegetables that's how I normally
like to eat so yeah that's pretty much
like what I yesterday but yeah so
without further ado let's just get into
it we found
so for breakfast I'm just making some
oatmeal and the first thing I'm doing is
heating up some water until it's boiling
and I'm just using the Quaker maple
brown sugar oatmeal and if you haven't
tried it you really should it's so yummy
I've been eating it like literally every
day and it's just like dry oatmeal that
you pour boiling water into it's like
instant oatmeal and then now I'm feeling
a banana because you guys know I love my
bananas and I'm just cutting it up into
little slices to put in my own meal
because I really like the way it tastes
my oatmeal it's actually sticking to my
knife as you can see that's why it's
like falling all over the place and I
usually will just eat the bits at the
end because they don't look as pretty
and then I'm taking my boiling water and
just pouring it into my oatmeal and I'm
going to make sure to stir it all up and
then I'm putting my bananas I'm just
placing it like all around the rim
because it looks pretty that way and
then they're easily accessible when
you're eating your oatmeal and then I'm
using Justin's vanilla almond butter and
if you haven't tried this seriously it's
so amazing it's so yummy and sweet and
it just tastes really good with that OH
meal and I'm not even kidding guys like
I crave this all the time it's like so
sweet and yummy and it's so good for
breakfast
okay so first snack I am just having a
nature Valley
peanut granola bar and IEP is like candy
they're so tasty and it's just good to
have a snack when you're hungry
mornings so now for lunch I'm just going
to be having a wrap and it's like a
tomato-basil wrap that's light like
orange like that and I'm having some ham
and salami on it because yeah I like
those kinds of meats in my wrap and then
I'm just spreading humus all over it
because it's better than light Mayo
stuff like that then I'm just sprinkling
some arugula on it and some kale and
spinach mix the more greens the better
and then I'm putting some dried
cranberries on it like craisins just to
add some sweetness and yeah these wraps
are like so tasty and sometimes I can't
eat both have both hats because they're
kind of big so sometimes I'll have Lucy
eat one or I'll just like save it for
later
and then I'm just putting some hummus on
my plate and some baby carrots and yeah
it makes me really fall for lunch and
it's just like really tasty and I like a
healthy alternative to like peanut
butter and Bluffs but those are pretty
good too
anyways so yeah I really like that and
then my second snack is for my crew
practice I was kind of hungry so just
ate some frozen mangos and they're
literally so yummy they taste like ice
cream I'm not kidding and I know some
people like to frost them or whatever
but I eat them straight up frozen
because they taste like the consistency
of ice cream - but like fruit and
they're good for you and they just taste
so yummy to me I love them and then for
dinner I'm going to be having some
salmon salad and this has literally been
like my recent favorite I had it for
dinner today - and yeah so I just put
kale all on the plate like a lot a lot
of kale then I have some cut up bell
peppers the yellow ones in the red ones
and that Studies on me sprinkle all over
the top with quinoa and then I have some
grapes that I cut in half that also adds
sweetness but I just put all over top
and then I have some fat-free balsamic
dressing because balsamic dressing my
favorite and this looks kind of funny
but it just cooked salmon my dad cooked
salmon for me because I don't know how
to cook it myself but all I know is a
super tasty and really good for you and
yeah that salad is like so good and I
actually ate like two servings of it for
dinner so I like a whole lot but yeah
that's all I
yesterday I had
oatmeal with almond butter and banana
for breakfast my granola bar for my
first little snack and then my wrap and
carrots and hummus for lunch and then I
had my frozen mangos for my second snack
and then I was literally so full after
dinner I couldn't even have dessert
because I had like two servings of that
salmon salad like I told you it's super
yummy and you try enemy definitely
