title of this video this video is going
to be a little bit different than my
normal videos and it's sort of personal
and something that I relate to think
about for awhile and I believe I am
ready to share it with you guys so just
bear with me and I'm going to try to
make this as least confusing and concise
as possible wow this is so weird that I
can like finally talk about it but also
if you're wondering about advice for
rowing um just for yourself getting
recruited like scores everything like
that that's gonna be towards the end of
this video so just hang on but right now
I will basically just tell you what has
been going on I felt like I was lying to
you guys for a year and it was honestly
so hard for me I hate being in a
position when I can't share things on
the internet like I just want this to be
such an organic and like free platform
that I can like share my ideas and like
my beliefs with you guys you know as you
can tell I wrote for the past year at
Boston University on the women's
lightweight rowing team and I was
recruited in high school with my twin
sister Lucy and I wrote for an entire
year I never knew that it would be an
issue with n-c-double-a but it was going
into my freshman like fall semester I
was notified over the summer that my
coach Malcolm he found out that I had
this YouTube channel and he's like you
know we'll just have to make some
adjustments with that NC double-a
regulations and roles and I was like oh
that's weird I didn't know YouTube would
ever become an issue you know so I go
into the fall semester and basically it
was like this huge like issue and I had
to meet with my compliance director
Aaron so many times if you're watching
this Aaron or Malcolm I a be like I just
want to let you know how thankful I am
for you guys and even anyone on my team
that is watching this like I love you
all so much and I don't know where I
would be without you like I've made like
lifelong friendships but I mean that
aside I'm so thankful for everyone that
was able to help me to get where I was
ultimately I had to decide that after my
freshman year I couldn't run any longer
because I had to decide just what was
important in my life and what I wanted
to focus on and I feel like I'm all over
the place already but now this is the
very beginning of my sophomore year this
is like my third day of classes my three
main focuses freshman year were
academics rowing in YouTube and it was
pretty much in that order it was
academics and rowing than YouTube things
sort of changed anyway going back into
last fall fall of 2015 I had to meet
with my NC double
i compliance director Aaron like all the
time and we'd have to try to figure out
what I was going to do with my channel
so what happened is I hope someone from
NZ Doble watches this or you can maybe
take into consideration when I'm saying
that would make me feel better if maybe
this message is helping other people in
some way because if you are an NCAA
Division one athlete you cannot endorse
products publicly so I mean I didn't
really know this or know that that's
exactly what I was doing the my youtube
channel but essentially our compliance
director was like Gretchen like this
isn't going to fly like your sponsored
videos you know when I'm showing
products from a company and I'm getting
paid for it that's endorsing products as
like a Division one athlete and as a
Division one athlete you're not able to
do that so we had to file a waiver with
the n-c-double-a requesting me to be
able to continue my youtube business as
I had for four years previous we made
the argument like listen I've been doing
this YouTube business for four years
previous to me being recruited in rowing
on women's lightweight rowing team at
Boston University so I should be able to
continue this and they didn't get back
to us for a month and for that whole
month I couldn't make any sponsored
videos I'd be very careful with when I
was like trying and putting out because
so many people were seeing it like I
just had to be so mindful and I mean
always you have to be mindful like
especially me being so in the public eye
like on YouTube like you all should be
very mindful of what you're putting out
there because everyone sees everything
that is what I've learned in many
instances so I couldn't make sponsored
videos for the whole month and they got
back to us in finding or like okay you
know what we recognize you've got this
business going on for four years
previous to rowing at Boston University
and what really upset me is that I was
like listen guys my endorsements have
nothing to do with being an athlete it's
not like I'm getting sponsored by Nike
it's not like I'm getting sponsored by
Under Armour because I know I'm an
athlete I'm showing makeup in clothes
you know so that's where I think that
CWI needs to kind of catch up with their
rules and that's where I was really
having a problem was because I think
that yes n-c-double-a division 1
athletes maybe should be able to endorse
products that are related to their sport
because then companies you know could
treat them differently and getting paid
and stuff when you're in college that's
like not how it is but I think if you're
student athlete and I heard that they're
actually trying to pass something like
this and the only thing is it takes
forever to get you know like legislation
passed to actually make this into like
rules n-c-double-a but i hear they're
actually trying to pass
so that Division one student-athletes
can endorse products that are athletic
ly related and they still haven't done
so but hopefully maybe this video helps
move you out there and again I flick I'm
all over the place but so they came back
to us with final decision and they said
you can keep making YouTube videos you
can keep sponsoring your YouTube videos
you just can't talk about rowing at all
you can't say you're deficient on
athlete IP you you can't say you're on
the women's lightweight rowing team at
bu you can't talk about bu athletics at
all
you can't talk about rowing at all which
is where I was like really like I
thought I would even you know just be
able to speak about rowing like
generally and maybe not that I was still
growing like in college but I couldn't
speak about it all I couldn't member own
apparel oh my god this is so weird I'm
not kidding I didn't even like wear this
for the sake of video but like this is
like one of the quarter zips I got last
year and hey it's proof P 130 rowing
like I rode for a whole year and it
feels just so weird that I wasn't able
to share with you guys and I know that
like YouTube is again like you know my
business but I also feel like I just
love sharing my life with you guys and
people were like retching look you don't
need to tell everyone that you wrote for
a year like it's not the big of a deal
but like in my mind it is and I just
want to be so transparent and like tell
you guys what's going on so I knew I
wanted to make this video and just clear
the air and tell you like yes I was a
Division one athlete for a year I loved
it I truly enjoyed every woman on the
team I'm so thankful I'm so blessed that
I was able to have that experience but I
knew going into the summer I really had
to make some tough decisions and I
really had to think about what was in my
best interest and my priorities and you
know what the kind of switch places with
rowing and YouTube because I realize
like YouTube makes me happier and
YouTube is something that you know I
don't know if I want to be necessarily a
full-time youtuber when I'm out of
college but I think that it's something
that I love maybe a little bit more than
rowing and I think will help me more in
my future and obviously academics come
first on top of that so again I feel
like throughout the year I just
absolutely loved my experience with the
be 130 community oh we also like if you
guys don't even know what rowing is I
mean if some of you don't know Aang is
I've talked about in my videos before a
year ago because I wrote all for high
school I started rowing in eighth grade
and it was amazing I've loved running
high school and obviously I wanted to
continue it in college and I just didn't
recognize you know how intense the time
restraints would be with rowing YouTube
and academics so also the lightweight
team
if you guys don't know basically
lightweight rowing is just for girls
that are like smaller and you just have
to buy in under 130 so it's just for
everyone that's under 130 pounds that
rose and as a girl you know it just came
down to I had to make some tough
decisions and freshman year you know I
ended up like injuring my back a couple
times and I really did love every minute
I had though on the team and again like
to any of the girls that are watching
this around my team like I love you guys
like you're the best like you everyone
support means so much to me but I just
knew that I couldn't continue to row in
the fall and I'm not gonna row the rest
of my college career because I really
need to prioritize academics and then
YouTube my academics you know kind of
struggled here and there and again with
YouTube it's something that I really
love and I wanted to be able to spend
more time on which I couldn't do with
rowing throughout the year I think I
sort of lost my passion for rowing a bit
and you know I'm not sure exactly why
maybe it's because I was in a different
setting like in Boston and I just had
these other opportunities I could have
explored that I was you know like
missing out on because if your division
on athle I'm telling you right now like
it is a very big time commitment time
constraint and for so many people that's
amazing and you want that and I knew I
wanted that a year ago today like I was
more than excited I had amazing time it
was so fun being able to to go regattas
and represent my school as a Division
one athlete that was always my dream but
you know like I said again I just had to
follow my heart I might look back ten
years down the line and say this is a
mistake and you know people have told me
this might be like the biggest mistake
of your life and it might be but really
all I can do right now is follow my
heart because I underpaying miserable in
the spring and just I was basically just
stretched too thin and I need to just
focus on things that make me the most
happy right now and while I will miss
rowing you know I can still try to hop
into single or double here and there
when I go home and I think it'll be
alright I just really wanted to make
this video for you guys so you know the
truth and you know what's been going on
because I really do feel like
essentially I've been lying to for past
year and I know some of you will say
like oh don't worry about it like you
weren't allowed to like I physically was
not allowed to look I had to take down
some videos I would get in trouble
because basically like my compliance
director was monitoring my videos my
coaches were monitoring my videos the
n-c-double-a was monitoring my videos
and if any of my videos just won against
the ruled out
take them down there would be some
extinctions against me like I actually
couldn't row in a regatta because I got
into some trouble so it was it was just
really really hard being a youtuber and
being a division 1 athlete and I
ultimately decided that I couldn't take
it anymore I feel like I'm missing
things if I'm missing anything maybe
I'll answer in the comments down below
- I'm leaving your questions also yeah I
was saying I was getting in trouble for
videos I couldn't wear any rowing
apparel or anything and like in vlogmas
that was especially hard because like a
lot of my clothes are rowing apparel and
t-shirts and my friends my rowing
apparel and I just had to be so so
careful I think I basically told you
everything I was recruited I wrote for
an entire year I loved it decided this
past summer that I couldn't continue
rowing anymore here at Boston University
I'm Homans lightweight team I just think
that's what's best for me and and now I
think I just want to touch on basically
your ethic he was about rowing Oh
although I want to say so also the
n-c-double-a told me they said listen
like you can't say publicly that you're
on the woman's like we're on team but I
understand you like I truly value my
relationship with the subscribers so
much like I just love meeting you guys
like this year my sophomore year at BU
already it's like the third day here
I've met I'm not kidding like 30 40 50
like plus of you guys just on campus
because so many of you watched my videos
and I'm just so thankful that you guys
support me and I love you and I love me
like I love you like it makes me so
happy like I meet one of you of I'm
having a rough day like the other day I
was sitting down I'm this huge
accounting assignment and I just met one
of you in the dining hall and the rest
of the day I was like like I just get so
happy so anyways event suitable I
actually told me that I was able to
privately message you guys if you reach
out to me and said hey what's going on
and so many of you did and this summer
when I was blogging I still was trying
to decide it took me all summer to
really decide because it was such a hard
decision to be like for months to really
just weigh all the pros and cons and
like think about my future and my
happiness you know to decide that I
wouldn't continue running but so many of
you said what's the deal with rowing and
send you guys like this big long thing
of my whole situation but now here's the
video for those of you that I couldn't
reply back tuned for those of you that
are still wondering I really hope this
clears the air and again if you have any
questions leave them down below but for
those of you that you know are rowing in
high school go you like I had such an
amazing time with rowing it really is so
fun we were trying to get recruited
basically I wanted to make this video
before my freshman
and then write the time I got there it
was too late and I wasn't able to do it
anymore and I thought I would have to
wait four years to tell you guys about
my experience and my all my advice when
it comes to roaming and just being
recruited as a do you want athlete but I
guess I'll need to wait one year because
Here I am and I can tell you so my tips
that I can remember back from like a
year ago
is if you want to be recruited you have
to put it in your own hands like you
cannot count on your parents you can not
count on coaches to come and find you
you have to contact them and also just
think of it from like a coach's
perspective like if they are recruiting
people they're talking to hundreds of
athletes potentially being recruited and
if they don't respond to you it's not
because they're ignoring you like you
need to make sure that they hear what
you're trying to say and it's not being
rude if you message them again if you
email them again if you say hey just
following up on to see if you got my
email and we're interested in looking at
your rowing program your basketball
program your soccer program whatever
like you need to advocate for yourself
and talk to them usually if you go on
the university's athletic website that
you're trying to be recruited at there's
usually like a recruiting questionnaire
I filled out some of those coaches we'll
get back to you that way you'll meet
some coaches maybe get ricotta's or
games or whatever sport it is for you
and just be like so polite and just talk
to them and be so honest that what
you're looking for and definitely look
at the university too don't just look at
it for athletics I feel like I sort of
was just like I know I want to
lightweight for one program I only
looked at schools with lightweight
rowing programs I guess I can tell you
now I took official visits at three
different schools I went to UMass
Amherst I went to Wisconsin and I went
to obviously be you fell in love with bu
but I also loved Wisconsin and UMass
Amherst it was like a hard decision
also if you're like really serious about
being a d1 athlete in college you can
take things called official visits and
for those of you that are interested in
at all this isn't gonna make any sense
to you but I'm basically a coach will
like offer you an official visit they
want you to come to their school and you
can come stay with an athlete since hear
you like it I think that's truly how you
feel like if you fit in with the team
and when I came to bu I was in love and
I still love the girls on my team and
I'm still gonna be friends with them and
again if you're watching this like I
love you guys and thanks for like
supporting me and I knew it would be
definitely an interesting period coming
into this fall and not rowing anymore
and I'm a tech person that I want
everyone to like me which I know is
impossible and that's why you know I
kind of struggle with like criticism
needs and times because I just want t
friends with everyone I knew it would be
hard in the fall because I know it's
people you know aren't going to agree
with my decision aren't going to see eye
to eye with me but I have to accept that
that's okay
and you know people that truly care
about me will just want me to be happy
and not necessarily care like what I'm
actually doing I guess for rowing
specifically to just for some tips like
I guess I'm not going to tell you
exactly my scores or anything because I
don't want to discourage any of you or
make you go crazy like measuring up
because I think I got like obsessive and
I would try to know everyone's 2k and
you know it can be pretty stressful if
you're a row where you know what I'm
talking about with two K's it's like the
big thing and everyone's just like
what's her GK oh my god she pulled this
oh my god you pulled that like that's
amazing blah blah blah she's a
lightweight she's like you know so I
don't think I'm going to tell you
exactly what my 2k is or was or my PR or
anything or my 5k every six hey you know
like my 30 minute piece I'm not going to
tell you that but basically just know
that working is a huge part of rowing
and it's very important when you're
getting recruited so that being said if
you don't have the best work scores I
would say race results matter so much
like my scores aren't the best and for
some of you that I messes privately I
told you my 2k PR I told you how I did
on pieces and stuff and you know and
really race results matters so much and
if you guys know youth Nationals like I
would say one of the biggest Slyke youth
regattas my junior year of high school
my twin sister and I competed in the
women's lightweight Youth double and we
actually came in fifth and I just think
that that race result helped me so much
and getting recruited like I was making
calls from like Stanford UMass Wisconsin
like buck now like just all these
different schools and ultimately I had
to narrow down to three that I wanted to
take my official visit to so I would say
if you have good scores that's amazing
coaches are going to love that but if
you don't want to not the end of the
world it's so weird that I can talk
about this now but if you guys have any
other questions definitely leave them in
the comments down below so I can reply
back to you and I think that's it so
thank you guys so much for watching this
video and I'll see my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
