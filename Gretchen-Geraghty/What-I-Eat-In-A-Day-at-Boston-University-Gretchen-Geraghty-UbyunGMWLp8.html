cut up an avocado on Sables and straight
ever no eating peanut butter clubs
walking this whole cycle crazy workouts
that guys I'm sure this is like gonna
attract my husband now thanks PS it's
just like a beautiful view out my window
good morning everyone so today I am so
excited to be filling the city for you
guys I'm riding me kidding last night I
could not fall asleep because I was so
excited to wake up and like film what I
eat in a day I'm how do you think it is
I don't know something about what I eat
in a day videos I get so excited to
watch them like I literally love
watching them I don't even know why I
like every human eats food but I just
think they're so interesting anyway it's
around 7 right now I've been getting up
so early because my wall is like all
windows which is so nice yeah good
morning guys so you usually just like
Nestle make my bed in the mornings it
makes you so much more productive ok you
should not make my bed in the morning
but I don't know it literally makes me
so much more productive during the day
so let's go get our day started ladies
oh my makeup it's just like my look so
now I'm going to be making an acai bowl
for breakfast I'm so excited it's like
one of my favorite things to eat for
breakfast because it's just like my
favorite food did I actually just make
lunch
do you guys know I have class like 12 to
4 every day so I just made some tofu
with teriyaki sauce cut up an avocado in
made some sweet potato yeah so I just
need that for lunch he's going SoulCycle
right after class cuz my crossings like
before and so staples at 4:30 that way
I'm not like starving because I like
medium or some psycho I don't think so
young this thing ever just don't hang
out so good
I think it tastes a bit different cuz I
used the powdered acai Joe guide and I
just brought you here into my room so we
could chat and you press this together
so most of the food I'm going to be
showing you that I'm eating today during
the day is from a thrive market which is
like literally my favorite new online
store oh wait actually something out of
the box my common room cuz I like hoard
all my things so do you want to do it
the box looks like so that that may be
helpful here yeah let's do that
when it'll look like when it comes to
you let me keep the inside is I know
it's empty now but basically when it
came it have a call bubble wrap around
everything to make sure that like my
almond butter didn't explode it's my
granola and I know I got maple syrup
small say you powder things and snap
peas when you know those mini adjusted
with peanut butter cups
those are living my addiction they're so
good in the dark chocolate ones I know
it's funny because I actually saw what
my favorite youtuber Margo Lee I don't
know if you guys know her but I saw her
talking about thrive and I'm like oh my
gosh I need to try them out because if
you guys have been keeping up with me
you know that I used to be vegan and
although I'm no longer vegan I really
enjoy eating vegan and let's plant-based
but I just like don't like labeling
myself like that anymore since Margo's
vegan I get like a lot of good ideas
from her and then I'm dry but you can do
it
filter all of the results by vegan so
all of the food that will pop up is
begin the reason I really love thrive is
because you guys know I'm in college
it's so good to go grocery shopping
especially in the city I live I can't
carry like all the groceries it's like
such a pain so first of all just getting
food chip to me is so much easier and
then also what thrive does it's like
they kind of cut out the middleman we've
been little lot about this my business
classes they basically sell all the food
on there at like wholesale prices so
it's literally like 25 to 50% off of
what you would spend on a whole food so
like this granola for example the purely
Elizabeth granola I always just buy
Whole Foods so expensive
I'm literally Chucky right now I'm
checking cuz I know at Whole Foods it's
like eight and nine like maybe upwards
of ten dollars and I'm gonna check on
thrive and you look at my confirmation
guys if you see that number 595
595 and then you guys saw my favorite
almond butter the Justin's vanilla
almond butter if you're my day one here
on YouTube you know that's my favorite
forever I actually got those on thrive
at Whole Foods they are like upwards of
$20 and on thrive there's so much
cheaper like I actually remember the
slip I got was buy order that I placed I
got maybe like five or six things and I
saved $38 like literally so much money
that you can go spend like clothes like
obviously it's like all the same exact
stuff like the purely Elizabeth like the
Justin John
whatever that's really exactly the same
but just markdown she liked wholesale
prices looks like the same premium like
organic food oh my gosh what makes me so
happy once you sign up on thrive you
basically have like this membership and
I love that thrive has like a CSR
component because I've been learning a
lot of besides business - if you're
business school you know just like
companies that have a corporate social
responsibility started in being so like
formal and business you but like that's
something I'm actually like genuinely
really interested in but don't really
talk about it when I'm talking about
what goes make it whatever basically
what they do is like when you have a
membership they give a membership to a
family in need and I love that time is
making eating healthy affordable for
everyone booked ate the whole thing
grapes it out on top of every day like
wholesale prices that you're already
getting from them I asked him if there
was something else they could give you
guys to make just eating healthier
easier and something I can offer you
guys as my viewers and basically they're
gonna hook you guys up with $60 of free
groceries and free shipping which is so
awesome like you're literally getting at
$60 it for groceries like you're welcome
like check the link down below so you
can check it out yeah about them more
about April giving five is so excited
it's a good a soul cycle today so cuz
it's literally just my heart and soul
like I don't know why like I don't think
of it working out I literally just think
of it as like a good time because kind
of like dancing on a bike you know it's
really it's just so fun it's like the
best part of my day I feel so great when
I leave I feel so great all day leading
up to it I feel so great well in there
but anyway I'm just you guys have to try
this whole cycle if you haven't caught
yet I mean if you see my videos before
you know that I can't shut up about it
so I can't show about a lot of things
I'm gonna go it's time for you and it's
supposed to be what I eat a day not
Gretchen blabbing to the camera forever
so we'll probably just skip to me eating
lunch okay so it's like 11:30 I'm like
getting home already because I eat
breakfast probably like 7:30 I don't
know I just been like editing this
with your emails and stuff Oh another
thing that I eat during my typical day I
drink so much water drink a million
water bottles and you'll just feel like
a million bucks I went through all the
trouble of packing myself lunch and now
I just feel like getting it now and then
days that I do get up early enough I can
eat lunch here before I go to class
which is actually better because then I
just like snack during class instead of
like flipping out for meals not actually
allowed to eat in our classroom anyway
let's go eat lunch done no I'm eating
peanut butter cups walking this whole
cycle great free workouts that guys
highly recommend so it's a beautiful day
in Copley Square and I made it through
my soul class somehow not totally sure
because I'm talking up a storm it was
pretty hard but um yeah 45 minutes goes
by so quick now I feel like I could do
like a double you know
so I am back now and 6:00 p.m. is just
like a beautiful view out my window I'm
so lucky and I just took the tea bag
that she was pretty quick it was just
like burning Li crowded
Seoul is still really challenging for me
like in the class but it almost I'm
so used to now that I could do doubles
like I said I could go for longer that
make sense when they're actually go meet
Louise in a be my best friend the dining
hall and I thought I was just gonna make
dinner here but I might as well just go
ahead and go with them and get to know
their because then it's just like a
salad bar all prepared which is really
nice that's one thing that I missed
about eating at the dining hall and my
freshman and sophomore year is that it's
just all like they're like ready and now
I just have to put all the time but like
I enjoy cleaning so it's fine but yeah
so some nights when they like want to
come down and hold me they just get
swayed me in and that's really nice so I
guess I'll bring you guys along so this
is like what I eat in a day I get a
drink more water though I haven't been
to be too much water
I'm gonna take some more of my nose
spray but I'm not as good jested and I'm
gonna shower super-excited you should I
wash my hand out I'm going to Seoul in
the morning it's I'm like obsessed to go
with this like I wouldn't like 4:30
tonight and then tomorrow I believe I'm
doing it like oh wait want to see
something hot first I'm sure this is
like gonna attract my husband right now
I like all the boys watching like look
it this is really cute it's like a good
burn I smells like dick when you're like
little and you're sick you know when you
put it on your chest so I can't guys
I'll tell ya it does wonders this is
like a horrible spot Pillman
it's only right in the middle of the
dining
Bon Appetit I got you know this Gore met
salads Gore met salad romaine in there
there's some broth please don't be one
of those called chickpeas is there
another name for chickpeas and then me
and Abby got chicken rice and I knew
your peppers okay yeah well they had
this way of just opposite just offer and
I just gotta go pretty monumental
because they do in Arlen
oh yeah you just technique I want to be
in are you now I like him but he gets on
my nerves sometimes you heard it here
first lady to live a do in Jackson that
beat we do not have
what's up okay everyone I'm eating dates
and making sure up
I'm excited my sister gave me this book
called me all looked up I didn't do
bleep
okay Lawler you didn't like you know I
asked them can you wait it aloud to me I
would love that
we got dementia Tyler doesn't read a
revelation
look I have this really big idea you
know how you say you always want to be a
business owner Taylor yeah oh yeah
everything was like automation now it is
I'll say but if you know how there's
like uber for people the others do or
for food like uber eat I'm like what if
well you know us packages sometimes
running hookers so like overnight
Ayres eBay and Amazon yeah but what if
there was like uber for packages but
people that knows to pick up a job one
could like Drive packages to your house
Amazon is like hiring uber drivers to do
that no way so like have packages in
their back and you didn't know that no
because I already got my idea and I tell
Mandy and she goes what do you mean like
the post office delivery packages what
is fun but I think that's the beginning
of a good idea you're on the cycle so I
forgot that I slice like ends off the
blog 1040x I have to get it pretty early
to go to Seoul in the morning I'm upset
I'm just gonna stop talking on it cuz
you guys already know it was a really
fun day to recap everything I eat I'll
just go through with you guys and my
also a bowl and add the acai powder from
thrive market and then it had the pure
Leon Smith granola which if you watch me
a few as well you know that's Lucy's in
my favorite girl
it literally tastes like cookies but
it's like good for you also had the
justin's vanilla almond butter so good
and then oh my gosh wait I didn't even
vlog on class so I didn't show you but
ads that Peter is also available in
thrive market and anthropocene class
fellow snack that was after lunch when I
had avocado sweet potato teriyaki tofu
very good very filling you can probably
get teriyaki sauce sorry my video soon
so looking to see if they have us
because they probably do I'm guessing -
oh yeah then I just had some dresses
peanut butter cups as a good pre-workout
snack I wouldn't recommend eating candy
right before yeah but I never for me I
was fine came back when just a dining
hall I had some rice with chicken and
veggies like cook food here I'm just
used to cooking vegan side you but then
like if I go to the dining hall and
there's like veggie chicken stir-fry
like I like that pretty much everything
else is like playing bass you know we
had that I envelopes I thought I really
liked their salad Spadina actually cuz I
love putting like the cut-up beets on
them cuz I really like oh boy I thought
I don't know it also didn't show this
look at you so much but I'm always
hungry I made a piece of cinnamon raisin
toast which they have identical peanut
butter on top of really good I like I'm
in doing that and when I came back I
used my thrive market maple syrup and I
dip some dates in they're so good you
