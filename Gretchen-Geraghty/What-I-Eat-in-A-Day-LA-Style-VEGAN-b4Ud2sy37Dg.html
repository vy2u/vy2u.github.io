had my little acai bowl for breakfast
sounds really good
you know from what's ugly school there's
a bowl it was like sunset Sunshine's
maybe whatever I fell in there a little
bit that was really really good ten out
of ten would recommend and then that
made me literally so full I don't know
why I just felt like stuff but then me
and Tasha have split that like fresh
mango and strawberry Cup that was so
good
that we got on the Venice Boardwalk
sorry I was just telling Todd should I
feel like so like sticky and sweaty
looking and then we're like okay we're
gonna wait till dinner so that we're
like hungry for dinner because we knew
we're gonna go this really any place
with an Marini by the way it was so nice
meeting an marine I feel like I've known
her I look as long as I know I'm Tasha
she's so nice and I guess I want to see
her on Sunday before we leave and yes we
didn't get lunch really well like I
guess our fruit we like also to be ate
breakfast late like I didn't get it
so you vote to like what probably 9:30
10:00 and then we have it go through
thingy yet probably like 12 so I was
like lunchtime mission anyway and then
you dinner at like 6:00 6:30 and that
was my Chloe and it was so good like the
whole restaurant is all vegan it was
literally like heaven cuz I got like a
beacon like Caesar salad and like
avocado burger but obviously it's made
with like all vegan stuff so it was just
amazing and I got a chocolate chip
cookie too dang it I don't think I even

dinner I went and I grabbed it but yeah
I got a chocolate chip cookie 200
