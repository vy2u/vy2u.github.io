what I eat in a typical day and this is
a school day and I know this is kind of
different than what I usually do but I
just thought it would be really fun and
interesting this show and I tweeted
about it and you guys seem pretty
interested in it so yeah alright so for
breakfast I'm just having what I have a
lot of times which is a piece of toast
with some peanut butter and banana and I
know peanut butter has like a lot of
calories in it or whatever but there's
like protein in there too and I'm
actually using PB to like later in the
video so I kind of a--quite both but so
yeah as I'm waiting for my toast toast
I'll cut up my banana and it just is so
yummy and I like that bananas really
likely right I don't know just throw
that in there like when they're sweet
and yummy
so yeah that's like one of my favorite
things for breakfast and there's little
oh and it's so easy in fact okay so for
mid-morning I'm actually filming this at
school Lucy helped me out and I usually
will just eat like an apple it's like a
break that we have during our school day
and Lucy's eating an apple too so since
we get hungry like all the time Lucy and
I are just always hungry we're eating a
granola bar in the hallway before a
class v period it's so random but we
honestly eat all day all the time
because I am always hungry and also too
I don't mention it too much in this
video but I'm drinking water constantly
out of my water bottle there's this
driving poem after sixth period because
we're seniors leave really a lot um so
then I usually just eat lunch when I get
home and I was feeling some carrots and
pretzels and hummus which are like some
of my favorite things ever
and they're just really yummy and like
salty and that's why I like the pretzels
at the hummus and there's me drinking
more water and I just feel like on this
lot too so yeah that's tasty and I've
been trying to be pretty healthy so yeah
oh also my hair is like pretty lady in
this video and I didn't use any heat and
if you're interested on how I do that I
was thinking video about that so just
leave me a comment below if you want
that so now I'm just eating dinner after
I went to the gym and I usually like
making salads law because honestly I
love to help they just taste so yummy to
me so I cut up some romaine and like
rinsed it off with my little salad
spinner and I'm tearing up some like
baby spinach leaves and I'm putting some
chicken and
shredded carrots and cutting up a boiled
egg on it because I love I get my salad
and I'm also doing some craisins because
I love praising and then my favorite
dressings like balsamic that I just
drizzle on the top and yeah I really
like that for dinner - um yeah like I
said look pretty much these are like
pretty healthy I would say I just like
eating better because it makes me feel
better and then you know you gotta eat
your dessert so this is like a pretty
healthy one - um Wow how many times a
nice did healthy in this video but I'm
actually using PV - with like two
tablespoons of the powder and one
tablespoon of water and spreading it on
top of a chocolate rice cake if you have
never had a chocolate rice cake you
gotta try it so we are may taste like a
chocolate cookie and it's crunchy and
sweet and it's just so good with peanut
butter tastes like a Tracy Cup but yeah
that's all I ate today and thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
