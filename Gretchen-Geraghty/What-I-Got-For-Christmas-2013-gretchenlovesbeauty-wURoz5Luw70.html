I got for Christmas first of all I will
say Merry Merry Christmas I remember
saying that in my last year's video
these videos are like so much fun to
watch actually like checked recently let
the other day and my what I got for
Christmas video last year is like by far
my most popular video that I have so I
figured I better film another one I just
want to say really quickly I think I
might've even said this last year that
I'm completely not trying to brag like
this video aren't setting up solely for
the purpose of you guys enjoying it
because I know you guys like these
videos like everyone tells me I should
do them and um clearly you like the one
that I put up last year and also I want
to say that this year I didn't get as
much as I got last year like last year I
kind of got a lot of stuff and I really
hope no one took that the wrong way
know how it is in your families but like
in our family we always get more for
Christmas than like birthdays that
Christmas is always like the big thing
like everything else is like not as big
as a deal as Christmas if you don't I
mean I'm sure that's how it is with you
guys too and I'm kind of going on and on
but yeah I just want to say there look
like Lucy my twin sister and I are going
to Florida for a week we're leaving this
Saturday and we're going to be there for
a week so that is like our big Christmas
present we're going there for rowing
I've talked about croon a lot of other
video footage yeah so we do crew and
we're gonna be at a rowing cam for a
week in Florida I'm also going to be
going to Costa Rica for like two weeks
in February through school and I'm gonna
be staying with my best friend Hannah
and we're gonna be staying with like a
Costa Rican family for one of the weeks
a lot of this coming years gifts are not
tangible items they're like vacations
that I get to go on so yeah I guess what
I'm getting at is like Christmas is way
more about giving them receiving totally
and like being with your family so yeah
that's my little
ran to the beginning of this video okay

you might have actually seen my tweet

Twitter if you don't already and I've
tweeted a picture of my iPhone 4 and I
broke it and I've been so bad I've
broken so many iPhones it's like I don't
know what what it is with me and iPhones

worked out and so that is like the first
thing I got for Christmas I'm holding it
