if you've noticed that a reoccurring
theme like all my videos when I get
stuff candy candy like I said in my Q&amp;amp;A
video I did make my personal Instagram
public to all of you because before I
kind of just tried to keep with the two
separate and then I was like you know
what all of you guys are like friends
anyway you guys want to like follow Lucy
which I totally understand since she's
like a big part of my life in my youtube
channel so I totally get that so I just
made everything totally like open you
guys can follow me now I have two
instagrams and you're welcome to follow
both and I'm gonna keep posting on both
because
one's more like you to be stuff and
one's more personal but you guys can
like follow both feel free you feel
welcome to follow my personal one I
could interact more it's like my close
friends I guess on that one so that
one's just acted crutching with fans and
my youtube one is at crush moves beauty
and then Lucy's Instagram is that Lucy
Garrity with two eyes I still feel weird
saying our last name is Garrity because
I feel
no it says fill anyone need you but it's
Lucy Garrity with two eyes like I said
before and then if you want to follow
Danny and dress in our boyfriend's
because I feel like you but some of you
guys want to follow that and go ahead
Danny's Instagram is that Danny Brandt
and Justin's Instagram is at Justin rm5
so go ahead and follow them if you want
yeah what Justin got me for my birthday
I was seriously so excited like he knows
me so well so the first thing he got me
is actually this shirt which I love it's
just this like white t-shirt but it has
little elephants on the sleeves how
freaking cute cuz he knows I like love
elephants and there's little elephants
on asleep it's perfect I'm looking I'm
even wearing a little elephant necklace

an elephant person you know basically
I'm an elephant
the next thing Justin got me I'm so
excited you see me with that mint and
vanilla us it's like blue and white
stripes but this one's pink and white
stripes and guess what flavors it is
strawberry and coconut I've never seen
this one of my entire life I don't even
know where he got it but I'm literally
obsessed and it smells so good and then
Justin got me the coolest candle ever
it's Empire fresh apple as what it
smells like it smells so good it's like
this really big candle but I feel like
like the candle and the wax burns down
it reveals jewelry but you don't know
what it is it's like hidden and male you
can't tell so you don't know what it is
until you like burn through the candle
and it says they can be valued at ten or
like two hundred dollars so you have no
idea what's in here at all a very
impatient person I told him I wasn't it
crack open the glass and get a machete
and like chop through the candle see
what it was but I won't do that
I'll just burn it off cuz it smells so
good and I can't wait to figure out
what's in here it's fun to have a little
mystery in your life you know and then
Justin Gaby
these are both kind of like funny but he
got me these Nike elite basketball socks
cuz I always passed it I always was like
you know the socks boys we're like
they're so cool I love that I'm not
really squishy I wasn't gonna wanna pair
I'm like you have cool lines I want ones
like you so he got me a pair yes I
so happy I literally love these and
they're so comfy and I really won't wear
them to like ruin stuff look I don't
even care and love them and then the
best president he got me he got me gift
cards to build a pair because I told him
I wanted to build a bear really bad but
you didn't know like what what I wanted

I actually chopped open my old one
