happy vlogmas day 22 everyone I'm really
really stupid and I just deleted the
first clip of this vlogmas again and I
did that the other day and it makes me
so angry but you really didn't miss much
feels like 30 seconds long it was just
Lucy walking into my room and she
brought me and everything bagel this
morning with green cheese they missed a
lot it was just a bagel so I'm just like
editing all day I got today's vlogmas up
and right now it's already 350 for
Lucy's gonna help me film really quick
I'm filming a quick like last-minute
holiday lookbook video it's just like
not even really holiday maybe just like
winter inspired kind of holiday like
this I know I'm pretty much gonna wear
on Christmas but yeah you need me as
much like pretty much I slept to like
10:30 and just like edited videos all
morning and yeah I really haven't done
much of anything today oh I think Lucy
now gonna go to hide yoga later that'll
be fine we're gonna get lunch with
Hannah Oh dinner with Hannah dinner i
yogurt and granola was really good you
should eat that
joe said may or may not come over later
tonight and help me pack more for Aruba
because I like have been packing and
setting stuff aside but I'm not sure
when I should internet brain you feel so
yeah we have to go come now I put on um
what's it called I shadow I feel very
proud of myself I use the smoky palette
case you're wondering they like Urban
Decay smoky one and I Lucy I put like
this lip stuff on from Maybelline it's
like kind of reddish but I didn't want
to go for a full red lip because that's
intense and scary so I just did like
it's like a lighter red lip and I'm
wearing my Daniel Wellington watch which
is going to be featured in the lookbook
video so we're gonna go film now are you
Liv hmm wait before I forget today's
question of the day also coming from Mia
ball she gets like shadows in all my
videos she always asked the questions
but my question is do you have a star or
an angel at the top of your tree I'm
very curious to know if you celebrate
Christmas of course that is because I
know there's like Kwanzaa and Hanukkah
and all those other celebrations that
people celebrate so yeah if you do
celebrate Christmas what is at the top
of your tree I think we have an angel
but I know some people have stars so do
you have an angel or star at the top of
your Christmas tree if you don't have
either of those what do you have at the
top of yours leave me a comment down
below I'm curious to know so guys I'm
still filming my holiday lookbook and
for the second month I'm wearing this
really cute statement necklace from
happiness boutique and I'm talked about
that so many times because you guys know
I love their statement necklaces I know
I've showed their necklaces a bunch and
like a bunch of different haul videos
and stuff but this is just one of the
ones I got this time and right here I'll
insert a clip the other one I got it
just has all these really big kind of
flowers it's a lot more like dramatic
looking in this one it's like a real
like statement necklace and this one's
kind of just more simple like crystal I
have a lot of statement necklaces that
just look kind of like this one or
they're just like it's just like this
plain kind of crystal color
it's like clear you know but yeah so I'm
gonna have these two necklaces linked
down below to happiness boutique also I
think I have a discount code for you
guys so that will be a link down below
as well and yeah I just really love
those same necklaces are seriously so
cute and they've so many and I'm like
affordable too they're not like way too
expensive so everyone right now I am
filming with my big camera like my DSLR
camera and actually I'm a your eyes
opinions what do you think about this
quality right now versus the quality of
my canon g7x camera because that's the
one that I use for vlogging normally
that I got like on Black Friday for
vlogging and this is like my normal um
like big DSLR camera except I've been
noticing it the quality of my vlogging
camera seriously is like just as good as
this or maybe even better so yeah like
what do you guys think does list look
like better the same worse I don't know
I just am curious to see because I feel
like in my head this one would be better
but in actuality like the Canon one
they're both canon my vlogging one the
powershot g7x does like an even better
job and it like blurs out the background
a lot and I don't know I just think it
has like really good quality so what are
your opinions and I really liked the
last look I did here's a little sneak
peek um yeah I just I don't know I liked
I have nude lips right now they're very
nude I'm gonna start putting my footage
together seeing what it looks like
hopefully it came out good because I
had Lucy help me film and then okay said
we're gonna go to hot yoga zoo and I'm
really excited oh did I even mention the
reason I'm coming with this is because
the battery on this guy died and I left
the charger to charge my battery at
Justin's so yeah now Lucy and I are off
to hot yoga Lucy just got me this new
yoga mat because I left mine FPU so she
had to get me a new one and I'm super
excited because I haven't done yoga in
like the longest time so yeah and
there's only what like three more days
left what you say sob sob love this Saha
what saw me
don't worry about it I thought you were
saying sup look at how cool Hannah's and
her sorority sweatshirt no I actually
mean it like I wish I was okay I guess
Wow
so I don't really know if you can see me
right now and if you can on a public
really gross because we're done with hot
yoga and we went and got dinner with
Hannah in those clips that you saw and
Marissa works there and yeah he's so
nice seeing them and I got to see them
more before I leave for a robot
Lucy Mir going home to make cookies I'm
so excited hi it was good today it was
at the instructor that we never had
before I don't know I just feel kind of
sick though I like to feel well during
it I kept having just stop and like yeah
I just I don't I kept stopping and like
having to like wipe off my sweat like oh
okay yeah it's good that we learned to
our lugging so because if you wear
shorts and hot you slip into your ID all
over the place yeah I remember times we
go yeah we could leave our shorts and
like any legs or iteration sweats you
just slip inside of her so I can't
anyway to go and like and like you I
guess you could wear long sleeve top so
that like your arms get all sweaty but
like it's not worth it like wear a tank
top but we wear tank tops oh oh I forgot
I forgot where we were going
we're performing some closure on Lucy's
relationship that we talked about
yesterday yesterday's vlog miss me how
are you doing little good oh I can
barely see you I love you so everyone um
it is about 16 mm mm and I know I told
you guys when we were coming home that
we're gonna make cookies but Lucy and I
really enjoy social and we're waiting
for a family that's downstairs watching
TV to go to bed until we make cookies
because we don't want to like bother
them or have them bother us or anything
