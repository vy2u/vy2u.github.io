of a different type of video and I
haven't made this personal of a video I
don't think before but I just figured
like seriously I consider you all like
best friends like I feel like me and my
subscribers are just so close you know
me better than I know myself I'm not
even kidding like I've seen comments on
my videos like just stuff about Luci
Justin Mandy Teddy my parents and I'm
like whoa I just feel so comfortable
with you guys so that's why I have been
thing like I should make some more
personal videos and I just felt like
this is like a really good time to make
this video specifically they can tell by
the title which is just all about hair
removal and I know it's kind of
uncomfortable and awkward and
embarrassing to talk about but I just
wanted to tell you guys my opinions and
just everything that I know about it
because I know it's summer time right
now and I just thought I would make this
video to answer I get some questions and
to just kind of like clear the air and
just make some things known if you guys
didn't know visibly about laser hair
removal but also like I'll touch on like
shaving I guess back saying so if you're
not ready to hear about bikini areas and
underarms and if you don't want to hear
about that kindly click out I don't mind
it's totally fine but this is just gonna
get a little personal or real quick okay
so I think the majority of girls tend to
just shave but what's so annoying about
shaving is how often you have to do it
and also for me I get razor bumps and
razor burn and it's so annoying and it
hurts especially like in the bikini area
like for the summertime the past couple
of months I've been like kind of
researching what I want to do besides
shaving I didn't know if I wanted to do
like the waxing Roux or the laser root
and I've been thinking a lot about it
and I've had friends and cousins that
have tried waxing but for me the reason
I didn't want to do that is because you
have to let it grow out in between your
honor's didn't really want to do that
especially in the summertime when I'm
wearing like bikinis all the time you
guys know like I'm obsessed with bikinis
joseon's FaceTime me and also I've heard
that waxing is very painful I mean
obviously some people have higher pain
tolerance aspec others but I've just
heard for some people that it's very
painful and I was always just too scared
of that so then recently I heard of
laser hair removal in seriously guys
I would recommend okay I think it is
like the best decision I've ever made I
just did my first treatment so basically
this whole video I wanted to talk more
about laser like I feel like most people
know about shaving and waxing but
specifically laser I just think is such
a good idea okay so clearly I'm not like
any expert but what I know about it and
the way I think of it is basically it's
like a laser that is targeting like the
hair follicle to kill it I'm pretty sure
and basically like the hair will fall
out and it won't grow back so I think
the average person to get laser hair
removal will go like five or six times
before they're completely smooth so I
just had my first one like I said I went
to New York City and oh I didn't even
tell you I go to Laser away so they
started in California but luckily they
came to New York City and that's on the
East Coast so it's like way closer to me
so I was able to go to New York City for
the day and get my first treatment and I
will have my next five following up
treatments there and seriously guys it's
gonna be a lifesaver I was talking to my
technician while I was there and she
says like it's seriously amazing her
underarms she got her Brazilian and she
also got her lower legs and she says
that it's like life-changing she's like
I just don't even think about it like
imagine just never having to shave again
like that's what like attracted me
instantly I'm like whoa like just think
about girls okay think with me or think
about how much time you spend shaving
like every day it's honestly like
ridiculous ever every other day or once
a week if you're me like you know what I
mean so it's honestly just like so much
of your life so I'm like okay literally
laser makes so much sense you're good
for years like a very long time and
maybe I think my technician was saying
like after a couple years you might have
to come back to get like touch-ups like
stuff like that but pretty much you're
set obviously shaving is like the least
expensive and then waxing is like a
little more expensive and laser is
definitely the most expensive because
each treatment I think is probably like
a couple hundred dollars so altogether
you're talking like a thousand plus I
would say but for me just like the
benefits of laser outweigh everything
else I definitely would recommend laser
like I said I've only had one treatment
so far and oh yeah peignoirs I wanted to
talk about that so I was pretty nervous
going into it cuz some people say that
laser hurts really bad but I've actually
heard that waxing hurts more than laser
so laser really didn't bother me that
much like it was honestly way less
painful than I thought I remember when
she was about 2 though she's like okay
ready and I was like yeah and I was so
nervous and she started going and I
didn't even feel it at first because she
was telling you that laser like if it's
lasering parts that have like less hair
it doesn't hurt that bad and then
obviously like more sensitive areas it
hurts more and what is really weird to
me is the drive inside I'm getting
underarms in Brazilian so she started
off with the bikini area and she went to
underarms next I thought it was weird
that she did that because I was like
well look I feel like runner arms would
be way less sensitive than bikini but
it's actually the opposite so for me
like bikini hurt but like not that bad
and then under arms well this is really
weird but the left one did it hurt and
the right one hurt so bad she was
telling you that like one side of your
body can be more sensitive than the
other and have more like pain receptors
or different pain tolerance or something
and I'm like that's weird like I don't
have that and then she went from my left
armpit to my right armpit but like it
really wasn't that bad and I also heard
too so I'm not even worried for the next
one that as you go through your
treatments it hurts less and less
because probably you get used to it and
there's like less hair there and
everything honestly after the first one
- I really have noticed a difference
with just how much hair is growing back
and it's really good about Laser is you
can shave in between sessions like it's
so good look I keep forgetting to tell
you things but basically super laser
like I said it's like five or six
sessions and you're pretty much good and
you go every six to eight weeks so the
hair is enough time to grow back in
between before you go again you know
afterwards I was recommended to use like
aquaphor or Vaseline are like
hydrocortisone cream it like is really
hurting or if you have laser bumps
because you can get laser bumps I didn't
experience any of those she said they
just kind of look like razor bumps but
they go away after a day or two also if
it really hurts you could use like ice
packs but for me it never really came
down to that like right after the laser
after the technician does your treatment
she'll put like an ice pack on and also
it was really really quick - each
treatment is only around 15 or 20
minutes and for me I think it was like
20 since it was the first time so she
did tell me more and I'm getting like
two areas at once you know but really
it's so quick so I just think it's like
awesome also you should not have it sun
exposure when you get a laser because
that can make you more prone to like
side effects like hyperpigmentation and
stuff like that she was telling me so
the areas that I'm getting lasered I'm
like keeping out of this side
and I think prior to your laser trimming
you want to be out of the Sun for like
two weeks ish and then after I was
asking her and she said they recommend I
think like seven to ten days but she's
like if you're just really careful like
wear a lot of sunscreen in between you
should be okay so just keep that in mind
also another thing I heard about laser
and my technician was telling me she's
like I think it'll work really well on
you because you have naturally pretty
pale skin but you have like darker hair
follicles and it works best on people
that have lighter skin and darker hair
follicles because the laser I think
grabs on to the difference in like
pigmentation cuz it's like a bigger
contrast you know so if you have darker
skin I know it's harder to get laser
there's like special types of lasers
that work better for you and I know if
you like blonde hair red hair gray hair
I don't think laser works for you but
you should definitely like check it out
and I think most people have darker hair
in their underarm area and bikini area
anyway you know like I said I go to
laseraway I definitely recommend going
there especially if you're in California
because I know they have way more
locations there and if you live in New
York or on the East Coast like me try
out the New York City location I just
went there and I blogged while I was
there maybe I'll have that link down
below
I'll have laser whaling down below as
well so you can like check out their
website and since the one in New York
City in the Flatiron District is like
brand new it was so pretty in there like
everything is beautiful and I went with
my twin sister Lucy and we were like wow
this place is like so pretty so it was
just a really like fun and not painful
and I think meaningful and good
experience because it's just gonna be so
worth it like it really is so yeah thank
you guys so much for watching this video

I'll see ya next video bye
I'm filming a video it's kind of awkward
