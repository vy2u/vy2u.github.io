what is on my iPhone 6 video and this
video has honestly been requested for so
long like ever since I first had the
iPhone 4 than the 4s than the 5s and
then now I'm the 6 and ever since I had
my for like forever ago
everyone has been asking me to do a what
is on my iPhone video so I decided I
just got a new phone why not show you
what's on it I actually wanted to do it
when I had my 5s but then I cracked it
tragically I really had my 5s for about
like nine months but I was just really
upset that it was cracked and so I
didn't really want to do what's on my
iPhone video because my phone is cracked
and I just thought it looked really
trashy and I didn't like it but anyways
so I decided to just go for it and get
the six and you guys will be happy to
see I put a case on it I just got my
cake yesterday so that's good this is
just the gold iPhone 6 with a case off
and it's kind of weird like it's so big
I don't know if you can tell you barely
like it fits in my hand I got it like
right as it came out and everyone was
saying like is that the plus and I was
like no no it's just the six cuz it is
like pretty big but like one thing
that's different than the 5s is that
this one is a lot thinner just really
thin it kinda reminds me almost like
those like iPod Touches I think it's a
lot bigger than the 5s is I think it's
like an inch longer I heard and it
smells a little touch bad thingy so you
can like open it with your finger so I
just got this speck case and it's the
white one and it's just white and like
dark grey I think or like white and
black and it's just like a really plain
one because I decided to go like really
neutral that way it was like match a lot
of things and I wouldn't feel like sick
of it
cuz I'm making myself wear a case of my
phone I have learned like four different
times that you don't wear a case you
will crack your phone so I wearing case
and I will not practice falling also
something new is that the lock button is
actually on the side right there instead
of on the top and every time I go to
lock my phone I go like that and it
doesn't lock because that's not
planning so that's my beat used to
alright now that I have that back on I
really don't have too many apps because
I use up a lot of my storage with like
music and photos and I really don't have
like any game the one game I had before
that I actually liked a lot was flappy
bird and I had it on my 5s but like
apparently you can't get it on the App
Store anymore it didn't like free
download on my phone when I backed it up
so my one game is gone but I just have
some other like basic apps that I guess
I can show you so let's just get into it
I guess I will zoom in so you guys can
see exactly what I'm filming ok I hope
you can see from the glare palettes all
the basic ones a lot of them I really
don't use but there's calendar then I
have photos which is just like all your
photos and actually on iOS 8 there's
like new like albums there's like
favorites and stuff so that's kind of
cool we have camera which is just like
the same camera look here's you guys aha
the camera is really good on the 6 just
like it wasn't that high this it can
take really good pictures then you have
like your little videos then there's
maps which are actually used all the
time because I'm really about getting
plays isn't driving and I never know
where I'm going so that is actually
really handy happens it all the time
then notes I have like a bunch of notes
in there and reminders like grocery list
whatever I really don't use reminders
too much passbook I think is supposed to
be like you can put like tickets and
stuff in there I never really use that
and I am newsstand I don't even know if
it is settings just all your basic
settings app store which is to get new
apps clock all my arms are on there to
get up early to store sometimes I get
music face time I use that a lot I like
to FaceTime people I don't know I'm like
obsessed with face time I use the
weather channel for my weather that's
like the weather app I use I'm like
crazy if I don't check the weather all
the time
then there's my mail and sucklings Taiji
mail so I really do like that mail app a
lot like organize it in a certain way
and this might be weird because I know
like everyone's iPhone is like organized
differently but this is how I just have
it
there's my contacts and gets into the
cool apps so I've afterlight right there
which is basically it's like a photo
editing app and I use it all the time to
edit my Instagram pictures in case you
were wondering I used to afterlight and
I really liked it you can do here let's
do a practice one so here is a picture
of me and a couple outfit and it's just
really cool you can do like brightness
you can like change that make it lighter
darker you can make it more saturated
you can add the cool filters and like
there's like light effects right there
this is how I add the border like that
to all my pictures so yeah after ladies
a really cool app I like totally
recommend it I don't know if it's free I
don't think it is I think it might be
like a dollar two but I think it's like
totally worth it because there's really
cool ways you can edit your pictures on
that then we have Twitter which I use
all the time you can follow me on
Twitter it's at GLB uit and that just
stands for crushing on speedy youtube so
y'all then there's Instagram and I'm
absolutely obsessed with Instagram I'll
give you guys like follow my Instagram I
just love Instagram then I just have
calculator right there I use that once
in a while if I'm like doing my homework
I have snapchat I also love snapchat I
use own time then I have Pandora which I
just use on once around for music then I
have YouTube I love the YouTube app
because I can see when you guys like
comment on my videos then going on to my
next page I don't have too much more so
I have this one folder that's called
utilities and it basically has like all
the apps that like you can't delete off
your phone but like they're like ones
that I don't really want and then these
are all the new ones with like iOS see
there's like tips podcast Pages Numbers
keynote GarageBand iTunes U and iMovie
and probably some of them are cool but I
haven't really had a chance to like
check them out or it's
like them yet only few our apps Facebook
that I don't really use that much
anymore but I used to use it and it's
good to like connect with old friends I
guess then I have Instagram which
sometimes I just used to put like two
pictures together if I want to look next
to each other for an Instagram picture
then I have by which I really don't use
too much but sometimes it was just like
funny videos on there that people show
me and yeah there's actually some really
funny videos on vine I could go in there
for like a powder or doesn't like be
entertained then I just have Netflix
which I will use sometimes on like long
cards I can watch like shows movies
Netflix is always a handy little app to
have it's right thing and then I
actually just downloaded like Flixster
the other day which is like a movie app
to see like movie show times in movies
that are out then I have your basic
messages phone music and Safari which I
just use those all the time and that's
why I have them it down at the bottom
and oh yeah the background is a picture
of me interested in I don't know geez
you're wondering think yeah that is
about it for the apps on my iPhone and I
hope this is someone interesting I know
I don't have too many I pretty much like
the basic ones and like uh some cool
like social media ish ones for my photos
I just really use Instagram and after
light I definitely recommend those apps
and I think insta frame is also free so
that it's really cool those are the apps
that work the best for me and if you
have any other really cool app site you
think I would like totally khana them
down below if you have any favorite apps
that you think I'm missing out on and
