of special video like it's kind of a
weird video actually so like a random
but um a long time ago I've been asking
like over the past few videos weeks
months I asked you guys what videos you
want to see now and they requested one
has oddly enough today what's in my
shower video so right now I'm in my
bathroom and it's kind of weird it's
like my bathroom is right there and then
my twin sister Lucy's bathroom it's
right there and then our shower we share
and it's like the little middle room in
between so without further ado I will
hop into my shower and show you what's
in there like it's pretty random and I'm
not sure about everything because I
didn't even check for this video but
let's just get into it
so this is my shower and we actually got
it redone recently because it was like
really old and gross and my dad like
retain all of this so and I don't know
how to explain it as you can just see
how it looks and then he built these two
little square cubby like things to put
on the shampoo the body washed
everything in so this is kind of like a
weird angle they show you everything
like right here and you can see this is
my sister Lucy's little thing me like
wash your body with and then this pink
one's mine sorry this is such a weird
angle we have just this little witchy
Michalek like shaving cream so I can
shave my legs and that is my razor and
then these are just two little face
washes I don't even know whether in here
like I don't really use them and this is
our body wash and I love it it smells so
good it smells like flowers and then
this is a body polishing scrub I know
uses that but it's just in there okay
and then in this little cubby thing we
have a cone
I can't so maybe it loses its like fresh
out her hair in the shower and then we
have this conditioner this is the
obviously 3 minute miracle and this
stuff works out like I actually love it
and then don't ask why we need 4
different shampoo conditioner
things these are on the Loreal like
total repair things so we have pink one
blue one in two yellow ones don't ask I
don't know why I've you just have all of
them okay and this is like also a really
weird angle but I wanted to show you
something cool I don't know if you can
tell but on the ground look what I'm
standing on there's a it's not like a
normal shower floor it's like a pebbles
kind of I'll zoom in see they're like
little stony pebble things they feel
like looking they feel really cool you
like to step on them they're all like
like rocks when you're like taking
shower we have one little surprise in
our bathroom that was actually surprised
after my dad built our bathroom first he
showed us and I couldn't believe it
so it's really cool if you just want to
have fun while you're taking a shower
like who doesn't want to like have a
party in the shower how cool is that
changes colors so yeah as you just
talked the little fast thing that the
water comes out of changes colors and
that's so cold I'm sorry that was like
pouring you're kind of weird but it was
really requested that was everything
that was in my shower and I hope you
enjoyed and I'm sorry also you probably
heard I'm very sick I'm cold
so my that's what my voice sounds awful
but I will see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
