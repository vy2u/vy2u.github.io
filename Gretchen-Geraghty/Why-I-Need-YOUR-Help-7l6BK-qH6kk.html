though just about 9:30 I'm feeling so
cute it just made me salad you said nice
oh my god you put a little cookie
outside we got it awesome no dessert
started vlogging oh really tonight
because I really just did homework in
editing videos meeting some question and
stuff all that cuz guys I mean quite but
I just had on my chapter so I was in
like fancy little outfit and I am living
in pepper to go on top actually Taylor
clean today you're the best ever you
deserve everything good that comes your
way in life but anyway I've just been
working on homework and editing and
stuff and is now at 12:15 a.m. which I
like going to bed a lot earlier but some
nights you're just gonna crank it out
and just buckle down and get it done you
don't I mean it's one of those nights
but a big thing I wanted to mention in
this vlog is I need your guy's help
I really need your help I mean my core
team that could really really really use
some of you guys for our project and our
product and what we're doing this is
actually what our questionnaire survey
it looks like in the printed out version
but it's right around 20 questions it
should not take you more than five
minutes at all their target demographic
is anyone located in the u.s. between
the ages of 18 and 64 so probably a lot
of you watching right now and
unfortunately if you're under 18 that
doesn't work because that's just not our
target demographic for our product long
story short I need your eyes help before
I'm just getting data on our target
demographic you should probably have a
smartphone since that's what you're
going to be answering about so between
18 and 64 in the US have a smartphone if
you could email this email right here
just acknowledging that you're between
the ages of 18 and 64 and probably like
your name so I know who you are and I
know who to thank and just like a
general location in the US that would be
so so helpful guys like thank you so
much we're not allowed to publicly post
it so I can't sleep post in the
description box of this video that's why
I need you to like email me and then I
were just reply to you with the survey
link and then please don't go like
sharing it anywhere I don't think you
will but that's just kind of like
there's a bunch of core rules and one of
the rules for core here at videos that
we can't post publicly so that's why I
just have to email it to you like one on
one
I'm like allowed to talk about it like
that soon I'm saying it's very technical
it's like our little baby almost just
because we've been working at it for so
long and it's really exciting just
seeing how much you've accomplished
already and we still have a long ways to
go for our final business plan but your
survey results are just so invaluable to
us because they really help us focus on
what we need to focus on and see what's
important was confusing wait you guys
like what you don't like again just
shoot me an email so I can send you the
link to the survey it's a questionnaire
it's on Qualtrics it's like this online
form that you'll fill out it should be
really quick it's sort of like checking
boxes and one see what you know that you
know - money my team maybe even me will
reply with the link to the survey like I
said literally five minutes or under
like 20 questions it would honest would
take me like two minutes out fly through
I'm just like can't even say how much
means so thank you thank you thank you
thank you thank you we need to have all
our results in by Monday so when you're
seeing this video please just do it
right now I don't wait because it's
gonna be too late and we need your help
and me and everyone in my core team
really really appreciate it so hey love
you guys thank you so this is so much
already for your help so I just realized
there's the night's pretty much just
going like this for me I'll probably
back for another hour to students work
as I can't in some videos um so I guess
I'll just give you like a little like
update I knew this would be hard to try
to vlog like everyday in core when some
days are literally just gonna look like
this for me just working working working
I know that's not super fun but I'm like
I mentioned earlier I did kids on this
waiting committee for alpha here at BU
so I was really exciting and I'm really
happy that I get to be kinda but part of
something bigger than one of me c1 LC
and like making a difference and just
the future of our sorority so that's
really important and cool so I know I
didn't mention it's leaving committee
earlier but here is where I talk about
being in symphonies depending on what's
right here and if you're in a sorority
or if you're in Alpha Thea this year
there's this new thing that you have to
do for your elections for a morning
eboard where it's called like slating
committee and it's just like from
nationals like everyone has to do it now
and we didn't used to do it this way
like this is the first year we're doing
in fact the current a board like
appoints isolating committee so today
they announced like the slating
committee and I was leading committee
and I like told them that I was
interesting but kind of like last minute
I was like Oh Julia like who's our
present right now
that would be really cool if I was on
there like I know I don't have time or
the commitment it takes to be on e
border eight board but I'd love to like
be solved as much as I can and I was
like no way am I gonna get it everyone's
gonna go gol ve like she does no sucking
around but then I like wasn't even
looking at me like like hey like you
made it my dad just texted me thing that
he's been liking my last couple videos
always typing right now he is the best
because he's just so supportive I love
you daddy when you're watching this
watch all my videos and please don't
watch
I'll just based on Tosh I'll FaceTime
her back in a second I can distract it
very easily but you know friends and
family it comes first I was like please
make time for my friends and family
which sometimes can be bad I like just
drag me from home working stuff but you
just kind of try to find a balance and
yeah I don't know just like speed it for
the ones that care about you because I'm
never there for you you should be there
for them
I don't know that means I'm I'm tired
this is rambley I think I'll just end of
the vlog here
long story short please take the
questionnaire if you are eligible I know
some of you are under 18 and that stings
for if you're out of the us I'm sorry we
were just focusing on like the US
markets yeah we really need your
valuable survey data is to really help
for us and I'm gonna shut up talking
about that now I gotta make a whole
video on core at some point and like
introduce I hope things you guys that
they were interested so you can see
actually what I've been talking out this
whole semester like actually see like
what's going on except like actually
take you to a team meetings show you a
car product were working on because I
know other colleges do you like stuff
really similar but anyway I keep trying
to end this one thank you guys so much
