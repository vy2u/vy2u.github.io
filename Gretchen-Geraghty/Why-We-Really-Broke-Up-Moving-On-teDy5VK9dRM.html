video that I've been thinking about for
a while now it's gonna be really tough
to get through and like talk about and
obviously it's very personal so I'm
gonna try not to get like too emotional
or anything
I really just consider all of you
friends and I just thought that with all
the questions I've been getting and the
advice that I now have I have to share
it with you guys I guess I've always
like taken pride in being so open to my
channel and obviously from my past
videos you guys know that if Tasha knows
everything like she's just very
supportive friend
so thank my last Q&amp;amp;A there's a million
questions about Justin as usual and it
was like are you over him and I was like
you know what honestly I'm not all the
comments really quite your strong that
you're like at least able to talk about
it and I know I'm finally in a place
where I'm over him and I can talk about
it and still it's not easy we only broke
up it hasn't even been a year it's been
like eight months and it's so weird
because it feels like yesterday but at
the same time so much time is fast I saw
Lauren Elizabeth's video about why she
broke up with her ex-boyfriend and that
just like really inspired me yes in I
don't know if you'll see this you
probably don't want to watch it I have
been really struggling summing this
video because I'm nothing but almost
respect for you and your family and I
really truly do care about all of you so
much at the end the day like I didn't
take care of myself first to be there
myself he wasn't a bad person he was the
wrong person that is what Lauren said in
her video and I couldn't agree more
here is one more things I wish I could
say but I don't want them to come out
the wrong way but basically just like
watch Lauren's video if you really know
things that I felt okay hold on guys so
I'm just undoing this video and I feel
like I have to interject I was too
scared to say it when I was filming it
but I'm just gonna say it now if anyone
isn't treating you the way that you
should be treated if anyone tells you
that they don't love you as much as they
use you or if you reach out to them and
say that you're struggling and you just
need their support and they don't
respond you don't deserve that and you
don't need that person in your life you
just gotta be there for yourself and
stick up for yourself and I say that
later on I know Lauren says this in her
video as well that all she wanted was
her boyfriend to say I'm here for you I
love you if anyone ever came to me if I
had no idea who they were if they said
I'm really struggling I need your help
maybe you don't know how to handle or
deal with someone that has anxiety
depression whatever they're going
through all you have to say is I'm here
for you and that's all that I need her
for him to say I'm here for you I love
you and I didn't get that I also want to
reiterate to you guys this is what Tasha
was saying to say it's obvious but you
only see tiny little snippets of my life
of his life you see an eight-minute
video you don't see 24 hours out of the
day it's kind of hard to convey
everything you missed things and he's
not only who he was on camera I'm not
only who I am I camera you know what I'm
saying obviously guys knew by the end he
wasn't the happiest being on camera he
wasn't so about that I just need someone
that will be kind of more supportive if
you do yeah by the end I just really
like wasn't loving myself anymore and if
you recognize that in relationship or I
started to feel like I couldn't even be
myself because I didn't know what that
was I was like I can't do this also for
his video I took away is she was saying
that she was in love with the idea of
love and when she said that I was like
whoa oh my gosh that was so mean high
school I would just see all these people
in relationships whether it be on TV
other view my high school celebrities
relationship goals you know I mean like
I need that I feel like there's like a
pressure almost right as you find
someone that you're attracted to they're
attracted to you maybe you date whatever
you like cling on tight and you're like
weird stay together forever we are
getting married and most of the time
that's probably not gonna work out most
people have a couple boyfriends
girlfriends before they find whether it
Ennis than the rest
with and I never thought about marriage
with him but I just was so in love with
the idea of love that I couldn't give it
up even though by the end I knew we
weren't right for each other and I
almost feel like I wasn't as sad right
as we broke up because I had felt like
our relationship was over for a while I
let that make sense and you guys know
like leader literally opposite you're
completely opposites like you aren't
going to see eye-to-eye on things and we
were just like such different people
that I don't think it could ever work a
realization finally hit me after I
watched a video that was like wow I'm
gonna be okay without him and like
moving on and I don't know I want you
guys to know that you'll be okay without
him moving on and I never thought that I
would be okay like being single because
I was always like obsessed with the idea
of love and I thought that I had to be
in love it to like be happy and I had to
like have someone literally after
watching Warren's video she was like I
like wasn't loving myself so you start
to pour all yourself into this other
person because you're not comfortable
with yourself so you just try to smother
them and love to make up for it that
makes sense and obviously that doesn't
work with certain types of people
whatever like if they can't accept it so
you just said 'no feeling like a really
empty him like sort of horrible and so
she was like after we broke up I was
like I just so focused on myself she got
super into working out seeing her
friends and family like that people that
really matter and her life focusing is
so crazy on her career I didn't realize
that until seven eight months after we
broke up and I really knew that it like
had to be over was when my best friend's
Taylor it was a Wednesday night and
she's like Gretchen you have so much
love in your heart to give and he can't
accept it it just hit me so hard and I
was like you were so so so so so right
so that was the weekend that I was like
I know many 10 things and you that I
have to have personally dated for three
years I wasn't gonna FaceTime in I
namely both deserved that type of
respect
Lori says in her video if she wasn't
loved the way that she deserved to be
loved and I don't know I would say I
deserve to be loved more but I just want
to tell you guys if you are like me
extremely affectionate and I've so much
love to like whore into someone you need
something that can reciprocate that and
if they can't they're not right for you
and
need that back or you're gonna feel
empty and horrible like I said before
Lauren again says that you take care of
yourself and you need to be there for
yourself because no one else is gonna
take care of you always and be there for
you if you're not a relationship that's
bettering you and you don't love
yourself like you should not be and you
don't need to be in that relationship
I'm happy to say that I'm finally moved
on with that relationship in my life
we're both good amazing good-hearted
people just not right for each other
which was the hardest thing for me to
grasp but I finally a grasped I guess
being so close with his parents that I
didn't want to film this video as well
yes this is like feelings of mine that I
wish I could have told you but once you
break up with someone you you're not
supposed to talk to them anymore and
it's so crazy to me is I'm sure a lot of
you were like this in your relationships
but since we dated for three years I was
just like oh we are together almost
nothing can break us up and obviously
most relationships don't last forever
either you're gonna break up or get
married one of the two and I never
really thought about just a man getting
married but right as we broke up since I
was really unhappy at the end of our
relationship I was obviously crying so
much when I visited my college we broke
up whatever I was obviously so sad for a
day or two but then I kind of had like a
false sense of heating okay because I
was in denial for a while is what I
realized like this is I'm trying to get
it still felt normal
I knew that we were broken up but it
didn't feel like it since we weren't
seeing each other at college anyway and
it didn't really hit me and I was like
oh other people have breakups where they
are broken up but we're different like
we're gonna get back together
I feel like towards the end of my
relationship I realized that I wasn't
loving myself which I feel like is a big
thing in a relationship everyone says it
you have to love yourself before you can
love someone else and I know in the
beginning of my relationship with him I
totally didn't start dating over 16 like
so young things changed from 16 junior
of high school going into your like
sophomore year of college so beginning
of sophomore year that's when we broke
up throughout our relationship obviously
dynamics change we grow up and by the
end I was like I don't even know who I
am anymore
I don't like myself we have to focus on
ourselves to grow as individuals because
you get so comfortable with each other
and all I'm gonna be like so honest with
you guys cuz you like my friend and I
went tearing up like so much right now
honestly not too long after we broke up
I was still obsessed with the idea of
love and I'm like I need someone to make
me happy so I so quickly filled that gap
and people say that rebounds are good
and they make you feel better and
whatever and I don't even know about
necessarily call this person a rebound I
don't think I would you're like on and
off for quite some time after Justin in
a way it's good they can distract you
and whatnot but it's not really helping
or solving anything and Lucy who's
always there for me obviously Olivia Lou
she was like Gretchen like I think you
really need to be single for yourself
you're always worrying about other
people doing things for them making them
happy like I want you to like focus on
yourself I need you to be single that's
what you need I know I need you but like
it's so hard when you're just used to
someone always being there for you
always talking to them for like three
years so again like I so quickly filled
that gap and was treating this new
person as my boyfriend and he wasn't it
was fine but what I really needed I just
couldn't see is that I needed to be
single and like it's okay to be single
and I think that's what I entitled my
video in the fall and after I mean this
person were done it is past March it hit
me so hard I was like I miss Justin and
that's what was so hard for me because
for seven months I was thinking that I
was okay oh look at I'm over him I'm
fine and I lost it I was like I can't do
this I miss him so much I was reaching
out to him trying to talk to him you can
distract yourself for so long but until
you can look confront and really try to
get closure with your ex-boyfriend
especially three years is a really
freakin long time of your life also if
your relationships because may be bad to
say that you only remember the good
times my first summer so many people
that it's so easy to remember the good
times you don't remember the bad times
and like the reasons you weren't happy
and the reasons you weren't loving
yourself and the reasons that you
shouldn't be together you just have to
kind of put everything into the
perspective and it's still like so hard
and we were to talk about it because I
would just consider myself like an
exception from the rule I'm like oh I
know this is usually have relationships
and breakups work but we're different
but we're not essentially it was a until
being in a relationship with someone who
is probably one
most important people in your life and
you're talking to them constantly all
day every day then in like a split
second it goes from that to you
shouldn't talk to them you shouldn't
talk to their family you shouldn't think
about them you shouldn't care about them
you shouldn't love them and it's just
such a quick huge change that's so hard
to cope with it obviously that's the
hard part about breakups I can
confidently and finally say I'm ready
and happy to be single people like Oh
like you're in New York City for the
summer you're excited it's like meet new
people and finally away from whatever
and I'm like I don't want anyone you are
now I want to focus on myself and be
selfish when you're 20 years old that's
the time to be selfish and focus on
yourself books on your career have fun
with your friends I'm loving 2/3 my
amazing friends from bu we have such a
fun time and I think that those are like
more important life experiences than
just filling the gap of a boy with a boy
that isn't right for you and I just know
that I'm such and such a loving caring
person I can't be in a relationship
unless I'm totally I'm 2% feeling I
totally can pour my heart into them if
that makes sense so I just think that I
will be single for a while and I'm
excited for it and I'm excited to focus
on what being single entails it was on
my career look I'm here for my
internship and it's probably like the
best thing I've been doing in my life
working on YouTube and surrounding
myself with really great friends some
people say if love comes when you least
expect it like it always falls into
place I just feel like that's always the
case I'm not saying that dress and I
will never be back together do I think
realistically we will and the way our
personalities are right now and how
we've grown I I don't see us together I
don't think that will work
and another thing Tasha don't you get
upset that's so many people every day
people bring up him I'm not mad that
people always ask me about him because I
hundred percent understand he was
obviously a huge part of my life I know
that it is such like a personal thing
and people just really strive to like
understand relationships and I totally
understand that I love watching my
boyfriend tag videos or a couple of blog
channels those are like the best to
watch of me
Tasha I even watched Aspen and Park you
know it gets so interesting watching
couples and so I still understand that
and I still understand why everyone's
asking but at the same time like we did
break up last September it's really sad
to cut them out but I don't wanna like
cut
kind of family out of my life I just
think that right now we need to focus on
ourselves I know down the line we'll be
friends I really do hope that because we
could have a really great friendship I
think it just takes a really long time
for exes to be friends again because
obviously you were once in love and you
once cared so much about each other and
that needs to switch to friendship which
is obviously hard there is plenty of
fish in the sea and I always thought
that I would need more experiences and
have more than one boyfriend you can get
over your breakup you can focus on
yourself and be selfish and start loving
yourself and be so proud of yourself
you just have to prioritize yourself put
yourself first and that's finally what I
did when I realized I knew that we
couldn't be together anymore because am
i happy right now and I'm not happy what
are we doing like I just felt like what
are we doing together I can honestly say
that all my friends and the people that
I'm close with I love so much and they
push me to be a better person so if your
boyfriend if your girlfriend isn't doing
that you don't need to be with that I am
a single Pringle I'm going to stand away
for a while I know it's gonna be a while
before I let like another boy in and
that's okay
but leave your guys's comments and
questions down below I'm gonna try to
reply back to as many as I can
to anyone that is watching this that is
in our personal lives just know that
this is so hard because I don't have
burn any bridges or any relationships or
make anyone think of me in any sort of
way in my personal life but I want to be
able to be so open and so honest with my
subscribers because you guys are always
there for me and I won't like help you
out when you need relationship advice
and I had experiences that can help with
that so anyway thank you guys so much
for watching this video and I'll see
your next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
