video I did some shopping for like
winter polish clothes just like warmer
stuff yeah I went to the mall and I also
ordered online so this stuff is from
like forever 21 Hollister brandy
melville I know you guys hate when I
show stuff from there but I just ordered
online so I'll just show that really
quickly these are just some clothes for
like more cool weather and I also got
some makeup because I haven't gotten
makeup in like the longest time alright
first I'll just start with brandy
melville because you guys hate when I
show stir from there so I will just get
it over with really quick this is gonna
take like one minute I promise the first
thing I got is this like okay it's
supposed to be black but it's not black
I don't know if you can tell it's this
like really stretchy shirt
it's like loose in short sleeves but
yeah if you're looking at mine I'm
pretty sure it's called the shearing
time and then the next thing I got is
this little cropped maroon tank top it
was pretty cheap it's just like a basic
tank top and I don't have like a little
tank top so I thought it was just cute
and I know it's a winter but I can layer
it with like high-waisted pants I
actually got high-waisted pants in this
haul so stay tuned and then I got this
dress stress is like black and it's long
sleeves I love it because it's like
different like I don't have any dresses
that are like a long sleeve it's like
flowy at the bottom and it's like more
like a loose-fitting and just like
cinches right there and I wore it in my
half of the week you probably saw with a
scarf this stuff I may have worn because
I got it in the last like two weeks and
it's really different so I'm happy I got
that cuz I'm getting stuff that I like
don't already have you know and then
this I got I'm really happy I got this
because I've seen it forever and I like
always wanted it and it's um you're like
an army green jacket those look like so
much stuff it's just like a it's like a
shorter one cuz I already have an army
green jacket but it took longer and this
is like a shorter like cropped one I
think it's so cute and I also wore this
my outfit of the week and then I also
got yeah
go I got this jacket in black as well
anyway is it me people who know I think
it's black I also got this little
cropped jacket in black but I don't know
where he put it but yeah I also got that
if I was also in that half of the week
so you probably saw it that was all I
got from radom elbow all right moving on
to hmm
I usually don't find like anything at
H&amp;amp;M but this time I was really happy I
found these scarves and they're so so
soft that's why I love that the gray one
it's kind of a good grayish blue I love
it it's so soft but the only thing is it
so thick like I didn't even realize it
I'm gonna be taking bears for this to
school it's huge like when I wear it on
my neck up I feel like I'm choking I'm
like because it's so like thick and
chunky I really like it and it's so soft
it's a complete ankud when I was up
check out the lady was like there buy
one get one free and I was like hello I
just grabbed the cream one two there so
sure also from hmm I got this room just
like t-shirt I don't know I like it cuz
it's kind of like basic and I thought it
would look good with those scars I got
it's really soft like it almost feels
like those ones from like brandy
Melville and from Hollister still really
like their bottoms insane with
Abercrombie but I just wanted to go
there to get jeggings into this haven't
you guys - can you comment below and
tell me do your dragons from Abercrombie
in Hollister do they like fade or like
wear out really quickly cuz mine always
like get really worn out and they get
like pili and like it they get like
holes in them and stuff I don't know
like the dark wash ones so I have to buy
like a new pair like once a month and so
I went to house or to just get another
pair of jeggings
and you know just like the plane like
jeggings but they're not like they're
normal jogging they feel like jeans
they're like you know they're not good
jegging material I don't know if they
don't make them the same anymore
I don't know their journeys really weird
so I might have to return them but yeah
I just like playing um dark jeggings
because I think they like go with a lot
my forever 21
I just ran in really quick and I got no
that's a lie we were in there for like
hours does that happen to you guys if
you go to forever 21
are you in there for like hours Oh
anywho Justin loves when I say that what
where does that even come from I just
keep saying anywho my hand thing
I got a stuff I got this marine like
thick in chunky sweater and it has like
white little stripes at the bottom and
it's so comfortable and this is like a
Gretchen sweater like I just buy
sweaters all the time that are just
plain because I don't know also from
forever 21 I got these maroon socks but
they're really special because they feel
like cashmere yeah that was those cute I
got them because my friend Han I got
them and so we're like matching now with
our cute little my socks in forever 21 I
got his room in tights and I don't know
how to wear them yet but I think they're
really cute and they might look it with
a good skirt or a dress or something
like that
oh maybe like high-waisted shorts if I
want to be all edgy or something but
yeah they're just plain when tights I
feel like I have something else from
forever21 what am I forgetting
dang it
our company I just wanted to get a vest
and I'm actually wearing ever coming
that straight now I took lycra
this one's actually for my overcoming
kids though Hannah and I decided that we
would share these best so I got just a
navy blue one but as you can see it's
kind of like blue a smells like
Abercrombie it's my favorite smell of it
this is like thicker panel then this is
like kind of thinner we share these but
um I've got a navy blue wine smells
really yummy and yeah I just really like
the best for like the fall and winter as
you can tell and whenever I see some
with the best I'm like I don't wanna bet
so no I have some of this from PacSun I
went in there and I didn't think I was
gonna get anything by just fell in love
with these like they're a little
ridiculous but there are these
high-waisted jeans and they're from the
Kendall + Kylie collection I believe and
they're like high-waisted actually gonna
get good use out of them because I have
a lot of like cropped things that I have
for like summertime that I would wear in
the winter except for my like host on a
good show so it's really good that I got
like high-waisted pants so I can like
layer the shorter tops in the winter
look at the back I almost cried
there were little bows they're so cute
like I know in the winter my boots will
like cover them but in the spring when I
wear these with like a sandals oh
they're soaking you can like see your
leg right there yeah like sold me
honestly the bows and yeah they like fit
really well - I know packs on sizing was
like weird I got a three I don't know if
that helps you out but like I'm usually
not a three I'm usually a good seer Oh
but at Pat's I'm a like one small so
yeah I got a three but I love them and
they fit me perfect I got this sweater
from PacSun and it's like army green and
if you guys know the Carolinas butter
I'm from brandy melville it's like it's
just like this it's like really loose
and baggy and like it literally looks
exactly like this but it was at PAX and
I started to sell like brandy melville -
so if you don't have a brandy melville
near you or you like can't order online
or something check out your packs phone
because they probably have stuff from
brandy melville like I saw stuff there
from a level so um yeah this is like
actually from PacSun though and it's
like army green and it's just like the
Caroline sweater so I'm really happy I
because I meet so cute and then don't
even ask where I got these I don't even
know I don't haven't get much plain
stuff so I ran into pink and I got these
like long-sleeve shirts I just got a
plain black long-sleeve shirt because I
don't have a plain black long-sleeve
shirt so I got a plain black one I got a
good tan beige long-sleeve one two and I
think they'll be really cute just for
layering and like with the scarves and
stuff like that you can like to see all
the clothes like accumulating on my left
and to the make up part and you wonder
if I realized my name on YouTube is
Gretchen what's beauty so you'd think I
would have more beauty oriented stuff on
YouTube but really like all my videos
are about fashion and I don't really
know how I feel about it like in a way
kind of good I think I've kind of like
drifted to the more like fashion end of
it you've obviously noticed if you want
more beauty videos can you comment down
below because I really like filming them
too I guess I'm not really sure how I
feel but yeah I just think it's odd
because my user name is Gretchen was
beauty but then all my videos are about
fashion they're kind of like linked
together like they go hand-in-hand but
yeah I went to Sephora in the store like
once or twice and then I also ordered
online yeah let's just get into the make
first I had to repurchase something and
if you've been watching my videos you
know I'm obsessed with this this is the
purity face wash by Oh philosophy and I
like love it to death like if I don't
use it my skin gets even worse and my
skin isn't even that great like acid is
right now so this like helps my skin so
much and I would 100% recommend it's
like anyone like it smells so good it
smells like kind of like lemons
and it just works really really well and
it takes off all your makeup look I
don't I don't have like makeup remover
like when my friends are like where's
your makeup remover and I'm like I don't
use any I just use this when I wash my
face so yeah this is the best and I
would totally say it like it's a little
bit pricey but I think it's completely
worth it to have a good cleanser that
works really well for you yes then I got
a benefit they're real mascara I'm
excited to try it out I've used like the
little one from the birthday so yeah I'm
really excited to try this and it's like
that and there's a go little pokeball at
the end yeah then I got the benefit
Porefessional and this is just like a
face primer and it says quickly minimize
the appearance of pores which is really
good for me
because I like big pores like look at my
cheeks and stuff I tried it yesterday
and it keeps my face really matte and
like no other primer does that so if you
have oily skin like me this I would
definitely recommend and I'll probably
put up a good beauty video with it
because I just love it that much so yeah
this is like really great and I just
realized a lot of the makeup I got was
from benefit and that was like not
intentional at all but I just guess I
really liked their makeup or I just want
to really like it so I just bought a lot
of it you know then I got this little
benefit Sunbeam and I think it's just
another little like highlighter kind of
like high-beam but like it's like gold
inside its users when I'm like more tan
maybe it's like bronzes looking I don't
know but yeah I'm excited to try this
and then I got a little coralista lip
gloss to you and if you order online
they like send you all these samples so
there's that Oh more samples oh and then
I got this little except thing well the
light is so weird I know I'm sorry it
comes with this Stila stay all day
waterproof liquid eyeliner and this is
like a cute little baby mini oh and I
think it's so adorable I have the big
one that I just I use every single day
for like my top eyeliner I'm excited it
comes with a little mini one because
then I can like bring it places and this
is like my favorite eye under ever so
that's really cool the main reason I got
this is because it came with Stila kit
in the like little eyeshadows I've heard
like so many people talk about it and I
wanted to try it out so I'm excited to
try this it's just like a really pretty
like pan champagne eyeshadow I'm sorry
the light is so weird right now and then
it also came with a little steel lip
gloss it's just like red so yeah that's
cool to the next look makeup thing I got
was this and this is the Olli and Olli
and things right I'm sorry
Henriksen brighten resurface hydrate
three little wonders and it's like this
set and I got it because I've heard like
good stuff about their skincare before
and I'm like all for like trying to
skincare stuff just because my skin I
would struggle with it a lot so I'm
gonna always try new stuff and it comes
with the truth serum collagen booster
the invigorating night gel and the shear
transformation brightening moisturizer
so I'm really excited to like try this
out and I hope it makes my skin better I
let you know in upcoming videos so yeah
this was like I think they look they're
really really small and like mini but I
mean it's cool that just like try it out
I think and then I don't know why like
this was like like a promo code makeup
bag and it has a bunch of samples in it
which is really cool like it has so much
stuff in it um it comes with the living
proof prime style extender like hair
thing and then I'm sorry oh my gosh you
probably can't even see me I'm really
sorry the light is so better you know
the Sun is a great night base and then
it comes with the Urban Decay vitamin
infused complexion prep spray I think
this is like a setting spray kind of
like I have the all nighter one if you
know what that is and then it comes with
the Too Faced tinted beauty balm like a
baby baby
and then more perfume samples and then
the origins plan description SPF
anti-aging cream and I'm pretty sure
this is like a really good moisturizer
there's some excited to try that it
comes with the anastacio
lash genius clear waterproof topcoat oh
I heard about this you like put this
over here am I scared it makes it
waterproof so that is a really cool eye
thing to have and then it comes with a
living proof nourishing styling cream
this is a configur sample and yeah these
are just like hair stuff and then also
this black little mythical baggages
really cool too well the day I went
shopping I got all this stuff and
naturally I went home and ordered more
makeup off of Sapporo which I'm pretty
sure is coming tomorrow so that will be
like the next part of this video all
right so the last part of my video I
didn't get to finish showing you all the
makeup that I got so I have it here with
me right now and yeah sorry I'm like
it's completely different day I'm about
to go to the gym so I'm wearing gym
clothes and I just had to like throw on
some makeup really quick for this video
so yeah just finished showing you the
makeup oh I got the holiday handbook
like lotion set from philosophy and I
just wanted this because I have like no
good hand lotions and they smell so good
I smelled that there's homemade honey
buns
spiced gingerbread cookie and
marry medley and they smell so good and
I just love them so these are really
cute and they're gonna be great for like
bringing them to like a school and stuff
I'm just like better than my bag and
then I got the benefits day flawless 15
hour primer and these literally just
came so I didn't really get to try them
but yeah I didn't even open it yet but
I'm really excited to like try it out
and I've seen a lot of people use it
it's like a good primer I heard and then
the same thing goes for this benefit
fake up concealer because I'm really bad
at under-eye circles and um so I'm
really excited to try this because I
heard it works really well for that and
it's like specifically for underneath of
your eyes and then oh my god I feel like
in the last part of my haul video too I
said everything I was getting was from
benefit and those three things were from
benefit and then I got two more things
from benefit so I guess I just really
like benefit I got um benefit Dallas
which I'm also very excited to try I'm
excited to try all of these I just went
kind of crazy and bought makeup that
I've been wanting for a while that I've
been like looking at so I just went for
it and I got Dallas which is like um it
says like a plum bronzer a blush so I
think you can use it as a bronzer or
blush not probably just like put it on
my cheek so yeah that looks really good
as well as benefits hervana which i
think looks really cool it's like berry
and it's all swirly which is so cool I
think so you can just look swirl your
brush and you have a really pretty color
from all of the colors so yeah those are
pretty cool the last thing I got is the
tarte lipsurgence set thing and it's
like a bunch of these on lip stains so
yeah I really like these and I actually
put this one on right now this one right
here I think it's called lovely so yeah
I'm with these all these are really cool
and these I can like throw in my bag is
just like the lotions and all that
benefit makeup I'm not really excited to
try because I love benefit but yeah I
don't mean for like everything to be
benefit like that wasn't on purpose but
I think I just like their stuff um yeah
