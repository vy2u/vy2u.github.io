on the couch
hey everyone so as you can tell by the
title of this video this is just going
to be my morning routine for 2017 I
cannot believe that it is 2017 already
like who's with me
that's just crazy if you're new to my
channel definitely don't forget to
subscribe down below so you can be
notified when I post new videos PS I'm
at home right now if you can't tell I'm
home on break I don't go back to Austin
University till January 18th so that is
why I'm at home and this is my morning
routine at home not at school
thumbs up this video if you want to see
a morning routine at Boston University
like a day in the life video for a
student at Boston University because I
would definitely love to film that for
you guys and yeah without further ado
let's just get on the into my morning
routine so since I'm still home on
winter break I usually sleep in a little
bit later than normal usually not like
12:00 p.m. late just today since I was
at filming this video and I've been
using this sleeping app and it's so cool
it shows like a graph how long you been
sleeping when you're awake that I just
go on my snapchat you guys should
definitely add me on snapchat sorry my
screen protector is like so gross - and
really cracked just ignore that also you
should follow me on my Instagram I
always scroll through Instagram is just
a Gretchen loves beauty then I go over
to Twitter to just scroll through some
tweets and if you guys watch my last
video you know it's all about my new
year's resolutions and one of them is to
drink more water so usually right as I
get up in the morning I'll try to drink
a bunch of water and now I'm just headed
over to my bathroom to start getting
ready for the day I'm just grabbing my
toothbrush and I'm also grabbing my
vanity planet ultimate skin spa brush
and you guys already know that this is
one of my favorites I've showed it in a
ton of vlogs especially recently I've
been using the exfoliating head because
it literally just gets your skin it's so
clean and so soft so obviously I'm just
throwing up my hair in a ponytail right
click to it get out of my face and if
you guys know me you also know that I'm
always changing my cleansers having at
school I was using like one from
philosophy in the orange one I use today
is just this Neutrogena one and I have
to tell you guys my favorite thing about
this brush is the fact that can you use
it in the shower
this morning I didn't shower because I
showered the night before and I know if
you guys want one of these ultimate skin
spa brushes they are normally 125
dollars but you can get it for only $38
if you click my link in the description
box because my code at Gracchus spa will
give you a 70% off so yeah I also just
around some light daily moisturizer and
leftover I just put my hands I plugged
in my flat iron because I'm going to be
the straightening my hair and then I'm
just brushing my teeth pretty
self-explanatory so now I'm just taking
my hair out of my ponytail and brushing
it out so that I can straight my hair I
was like you know Gretchen you're gonna
use some heat protectant so I found some
in my
ready wouldn't mean my hair really weird
and my greasy right there so I was like
reading what was I like I don't even
know it kind of is but I just found it
in my cabinet you know but anyway I
think it actually started to go away
once I straightened it but you guys know
how to straighten your hair so I just
cut that part out and that is just my
straight hair and now I'm taking out all
my makeup so I can do my makeup for the
day I'm not going to be showing how I do
it because I want to do an updated
makeup routine and by the way comment
down below video requests that's a
little sneak preview guy I baked my face
so this is the finished look what do you
guys think I know it's like a lot but I
was filming that day so I like to put on
a lot of makeup and I've just been
really getting into makeup I've been
doing like my eyebrows and everything I
have an eyebrow transformation video
coming soon like thumbs up this video if
you're excited about that because my
eyebrows have literally been transformed
and lol at Teddy so normally in the
morning I would just cuddle and play
with my puppy Teddy well I guess he's
not really puppy anymore he's been
getting so big but I'll just hang out
with him and now making one my favorite
breakfast ever I literally eat it like
all the time it's just a plain oatmeal
with a peanut butter and banana in today
doesn't have banana but that's okay so
I'm just having a dance party while my
oatmeal is cookie Teddy literally had my
sweater in his mouth he likes to you
know steal things from people's rooms
their sweaters their socks their shoes
and now we're just running around in
surround having a grand old time he was
so much energy and that was all my oh
meal is cooling I just threw some peanut
butter in there and some cinnamon mix oh
good no banana no problem and I'm just
skipping around because I have too much
energy in the morning as well if you
haven't tried a plain oatmeal with
peanut butter and cinnamon it's so good
