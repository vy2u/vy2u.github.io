winter night routine for you and I
actually filmed this when I was home
over a break so you guys can see my room
at home and today I'm just wearing this
top from PacSun thought I would just
drain my outfit while I was at it and
I'm wearing my favorite new leggings
from the lemon that I actually showed in
my Black Friday haul video and they
focus on the side so I just love them
and I'm just on my phone right now now
I'm just going on my computer I'm just
looking at all my comments on my newest
videos and I love replying to guys and
it's just so much fun to interact and
read all your comments I literally
branes my day and then I'm just going on
to Spotify to listen to some music if
you don't pull me on Spotify you totally
should it's just at Gretchen Garrity and
I'm loving my fall playlist right now I
have a lot of jams on there it's a
really good playlist and I'm just
started making my winter one which only
has a couple songs but it has some
really really good ones
anywho I'm just cuddling with Charlie
and fun pack guys this video was filmed
literally at 3:00 a.m. so I was so tired
and I was like falling asleep and you
ever get that when you're getting ready
for bed you just wanna like go right to
bed do you want to like get all ready
and everything but I'm getting up and
I'm going to my bathroom to start
getting unready for the night now I'm
gonna change really quick watch how
quick this is
guys I changed so quick are you proud
and then my top is just this long-sleeve
crew shirt that I got it like a ricotta
sometime and I just got my hair done too
I'm just wearing these pink really comfy
baggy sweatpants and here's my makeup
looks like from the day and my skin even
if you could tell from just there hasn't
been doing so well recently I just threw
my hair up in a bun because now you
could see my whole skincare routine
warning you right now it's really long
so usually I use this clear start
foaming face wash but tonight I decided
to go for the pore scrubbing the pore
control scrub because I decided I wanted
to exfoliate my skin and I hadn't done
that in a while my skin it really isn't
doing well like I was like really
contemplating whether or not to film
this video because my skin is not doing
so hot I don't really want you guys to
see me without makeup on but I just
decided why not so I'm just rubbing it
all over my face and as you can see when
I wash my face I take off my makeup at
the same time so my face gets all black
from my mascara
and I just dry off my skin step one
complete there's lots of steps so
Fester's all my skin looks like right
now and not really comfortable being on
camera with it but you know everyone has
their insecurities now I'm just using
this all-over toner which I actually use
so much it's like the best you just
spray it on your face like that I like
to kind of rub it into with some tissues
and sometimes I'll even use this toner
on its own too if I just want to spruce
up my skin you know now I'm using this
overnight treatment which is just really
good at helping get rid of my acne is
just kind of like an all-over product or
at least that's how I use it I just kind
of rub it in all over my face and I'll
just dot it around my face and I'm just
like to rub it in really really well and
I use a bunch of clear start products
together I've been using them for like
the past month and it's been making my
skin so much better like you probably
can't even tell in this clip because I
know have lots of pimples in my face but
it has been a lot lot worse I've been
dealing with acne for a while and I
found with using all these clear start
products together that it's just been
really helping with like all my symptoms
of acne because my skin will get really
red as you can tell by watching this
video and it helps getting my skin back
to the way it should be so now I'm just
using this moisturizer which is the
hydrating lotion and it's really good at
hydrating my face just like it says it
does and yeah I just rub it all over my
face and I usually will use this one at
nighttime because it's a little bit
thicker there's another moisturizer too
that I'll use during the day that I'll
show you but like I said I like using
this one at night just so that I can
soak into my skin while I sleep and I
found that using a moisturizer overnight
just makes my skin it's so much better
even that was kind of opposed to it for
a while just because I have oily skin
but even if you have oily skin guys
seriously use moisturizer because it
makes it a lot better I swear now I'm
using the emergency spot fix little
thing which is just like a kind of more
concentrated acne treatment that'll put
my really bad spots so as you can see
I'm putting it on all the spots that I
have like pretty bad breakouts that are
really noticeable in this spot trim and
we'll just help dry them up even more
and I notice my skin gets really bad
when I use like harsh chemicals and
fragrances and different face washes and
makeup in stuff so I think that's why
this line has been working really well
for me because it doesn't have harsh
chemicals or any of that it just helps
like revitalize my
like I said before I've been using it
all together so I think that's been
helping too and like I said that's just
the daily like thanks wash that I'll use
in the morning and just the Matt
moisturizer so it's really good during
the day because you can so moisturize
your skin which is really good for your
skin but it will help keep your face
matte as well so it's like perfect for
me so basically if you can't tell I'm
clearly obsessed with like a whole of
the clear start face stuff and now I'm
just brushing my teeth I was just
laughing at myself filming I just I was
having a fun time you know and so yeah I
just brushed my teeth like normal and
then I'm taking my hair down cuz I don't
like to sleep with it up because it
hurts my head a little you know like if
your ponytail is too tight or it kind of
makes your hair bumpy too now I'm
finally getting into bed it was so silly
when I felt as I was so tired I can
usually only sleep on my stomach
all rightie of you guys like that to
look you just can't sleep anyway else
other than on your stomach yeah thanks
for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
