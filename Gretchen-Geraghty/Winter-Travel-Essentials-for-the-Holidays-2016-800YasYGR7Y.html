travel essential video or what to rig
with your traveling just Alex on your
holiday vacation because I know that
I've been looking for videos like this I
think they're so helpful and I always
travel like over winter break and I'm
about to go home for a whole month from
college so I just thought this video to
be really helpful for you guys cuz I got
a lot of people to travel over break and
I think I have a really good idea of
what keeps me occupied and keeps me
happy on long car rides among plane
rides because I've been doing all of
those in my time here on planet earth
first essential would definitely be
comfy clothes and I just grabbed this
fleece Patagonia sweatshirt that I have
because this is so comfy and comfy
clothes it's always a must have
especially when I'm on plane rides I
always wear leggings in a sweatshirt
because they're just super comfy and you
just gotta be comfortable especially if
you're going like you Coast West Coast
or like traveling to Oklahoma you know
you just you gotta be comfy so I don't
know about you guys but I get so bored
on long plane rides and on cards and I
need something to keep me busy and if
you guys know me and you like know my
videos you know that I'm obsessed with
this one game that called best fiends
and I know I've talked about it before
but seriously I'm obsessed
so here I'll show you what it is it just
looks like that and he's all Christmasy
for winter and I've already talked about
on my vlog channel a bunch but I just
have so much fun at playing this game
and I'm on level 41 so try to catch up
but if you guys don't know it's just
like an adventure a puzzle game and then
you match at the same at colored objects
yeah that's how you play and like you
guys saw I'm level 41 leave a comment
down below what level you guys around
and this month for December the whole
game is gonna be it turned into like
holiday themes and thank you miss means
it so much for sponsoring this video and
you can it click the link in the downbar
so you guys can check out the app in
download it for free so the next
essential I have for traveling is
actually on my phone as well and it'd
just be Spotify music app and if you
guys know like Lucy my twin sister me
you know weird obsessed and we're always
on here and all of my music on here is
essentially her music like I don't even
really have my own music taste it's
really just Lucy's music that I just
like savor and playlist so I guess I'll
just tell you my user name is Gretchen
Garrity and Lucy's is Lucy Garrity and
honestly I would say follow me but you
should probably just follow her because
her blends are better and she's like
Spotify came and she has like so many
followers in Spotify
basically Spotify is definitely an
essential when I'm traveling and I like
the premium ones I was
I have the premium one because I like it
student so it's cheaper too so I
definitely recommend getting the premium
one if you guys use a lot because I use
it everyday like when I work out I use
it when I'm getting ready it's like so
worth it and I think it's like $5.99 a
month I want to say if you're a student
so I really like that and it's really
worth it for me but anyway probably a
lot of you already have it and ready to
know what I'm talking about are just so
good and the reason prettiman matters is
because if you're on a plane and you
like don't have Wi-Fi you can like
download the playlist and still listen
to them or like if you're on a car ride
you only four enough data so to go with
that
the fourth essential I picked out I
picked out eight by the way in case
you're wondering it's just a pair of
headphones I got these new up power
beats and these are actually Lucy's
white ones and I've been waiting to say
this in a vlog but I've been too scary
so I'm just gonna say you know really
quick and then it's just gonna be over I
got the new black power beats three on
Black Friday and I have him for about
three days and then when I was at fit
right here at BU I was working out one
Monday morning like two weeks ago and I
believe I left them at the gym and
they've just been going ever since so I
literally only had them for three days
and I'm like really really really sad
about it if any of you go to BU and
found a pair of black powerbeats hit me
up I'm not kidding because I miss them
and I really want to have
but anyway so these are just lieu season
I just got them to show you for this
video guy I really only had mine for
three days but I would recommend them
because I really do like them but any
headphones will do and now I've realized
I should probably just take with my
really cheap ones because I can't handle
expensive one I don't even remember
whatever wrong but the next thing I
grabbed to show you guys for traveling
which is definitely an essential of mine
is a snack because I'm always hungry I
get hungry like every couple hours just
like Lucy Lucy's always hunt for their
kids in like three hours like every
three hours if she's not eating she's
like really she's hangry you know she's
hangry try to describe the kind of
cinnamon Oh custard with black seed
granola and this is a granola that is
new to me I've been trying out recently
and I really like it it's really good
but really any granola or like any snack
I just grab this because I like always
tend to go for granola cuz it's really
easy and you can just you know munch on
it on the plane okay so the next thing I
want to show I'm five years old but you
guys need like a pillow or maybe a
blankie or something - just like snuggle
up in cozy online
plane rides I don't know about you guys
but I can't sleep like I just can't
sleep I try but I can but I still use
Charlie to like cuddle up I usually have
them on my lap so I can like edit videos
and he like keeps my legs warm and yeah
I would definitely recommend a pillow
but though because they're really nice
and they're your friends we are nearing
the end guys second to last thing is gum
have gum when you travel because
especially on clean eyes do I keep as I
can keep just much being playing their
eyes I think a lot of this is for like a
plane travel my ears will always pop
like on the plane so this is one helpful
last essential I have for you guys is
just touch-up beauty products and I just
grabbed this new eyebrow pencil I
literally got it two days ago it's the
honest Agia brow Wiz in soft brown
because of you guys know people have
been commenting that they like my
eyebrows I'm like thank you I really try
hard because everyone hated them for a
while I'm like I've been trying to let
them grow out and like do well and yeah
it's also like my Piron today's very odd
I like put on a workout tank top and put
on like a bunch of makeup just to film
his videos house and I had let's see
French made my hair but anyway okay what
was I saying
oh yeah normally I use the soft brown
honest Tasha dip brow pomade but I
thought I would pick up this pencil in
case I didn't have time to like do a
full brow if I just want to like slap
but I'm really quick or this way I can
like throw it my purse and like touch up
my brows you know you always got to keep
those eyebrows on fleek
ladies and then I just grabbed this
chapstick because I always have
chapstick with me and my lips are always
trapped especially now like in the
winter you guys are traveling over break
like you those lips and moisturize in
this I just grabbed is the fresh sugar
it's from Sephora and I like it it's
nice thank you guys so much for watching
this video definitely don't forget to go
download at best fiends I have it linked
down below and it's free and I always
use it when I'm traveling or nida
procrastinating so neighbor alright
basically that's all week so yeah thank
you guys so much watching this video and
I'll see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
