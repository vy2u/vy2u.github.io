I'm about to get a healthy snack I like
to eat a healthy snack when I get home
from school because I'm usually pretty
hungry after a long day at school
and you can choose anything that you
want to go with your apples but I
personally love peanut butter the best
so are under scooping some peanut butter
that I can dip my apple slices into and
this is a really like healthy
alternative to something sugary and
fattening and it's really yummy as well
so I love eating this when I get back
from school and also be super careful
when you're putting your apples I don't
want any of you to get cut or anything
like that but um yeah and I also just
use a cutting board so I'm just eating
my apple slices and I mean it's pretty
quick snack I can usually eat it within
like five minutes I don't even know if
that matters but anyway okay I'm
drinking water and water is so so
important I drink it so much throughout
this video you'll see but yeah I'm just
dressing
I can't even stress enough how important
water is and now I'm getting changed
super quick would you look at that okay
I'm just kidding but um so you're gonna
need some ear solos unless you're gonna
get bored and I use a nice Bowl and for
music and those are just my favorite
wedding suitors of workout sneakers and
I always wear half casts because I hate
my ankle socks like split them
yeah sister 9 and then you got to put up
your hair if it's long and get to me
face like mmm
and you can pause the video right here
if you want to see what we're doing is
just called 100 workout and this is the
playlist I usually listen to and look
I'm drinking more water I told you it's
very important and it just helps you
feel better I don't even know how to
explain it and then I got to spice up my
jumping jacks sometimes because how
boring can nose be and then I'm just
doing some crunches and leg lifts and
what I just said in that 100 workout you
can see if you pause and look back um
but I mean it's just like a really quick
workout and add some running at the end
and my terrible squats drinking more
water again and again and I really like
working out with my sister she makes it
a lot more fun and we're just going on
our jog so yeah that's it
although working out can make you feel
exhausted in the long run you will be a
lot happier about yourself so you just
gotta get back up
because my donut crew yeah I really hope
you enjoyed and I have a lot fun filming
this video I put a lot of hard work into
it so if you like this video please
thumbs up below and yeah that's pretty
much it so thank you so much for
watching and I'll see you in my next
video bye oh my god there's like war on
people right there and they like think
I'm enough tripod but I mean it's and I
started to film on the side right so
comfy do you go fish</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
