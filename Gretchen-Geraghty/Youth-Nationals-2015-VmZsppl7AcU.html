felt like such a long day we had to get
up at 4:45 a to catch our flight we
finally got to our hotel here in
Sarasota right around 12 ish so then we
just got lunch and we went to the course
and we did some practice and our boats
but it was thunder storm again raining
so we're literally soaking wet and like
all muddy and it was like terrible but
yeah I'm gonna shower and we're gonna go
to dinner and as I hope you're enjoying
so part eight you liked this video $20
or not I'll protect you come on now
isn't a good idea if you're like asthma
attack 20 seconds ago have you got this
in your mouth an extra five okay you go
in all the way but not your hair your
face - just not your hair is using
taking the defense you can swim then you
know how to swim even if Evan Tanner if
it's 100 you can still swim are you in
to make money or not
Lucy you know how to swim come on let's
do it if she wants to make twenty bucks
that's okay I guess I counts I don't
want to leave we've literally been here
five days and I feel like I got here
like five minutes ago
today's Sunday finals day at Youth
Nationals it's so sunny in palm tree E
and nice here and I don't want to go
back home all of a sudden I realize my
voice is kind of going away so sorry
that's like bothering you so iris in a
quad here in my quad although we didn't
make it to finals we still had good
races actually three of the girls in my
boat - me were very sick like one girl
could not breathe and one girl went to
like the emergency room so for being
very sick we actually did fairly decent
and we're like really small going into
it like all the girls in my boater
lightweights and we raced in the
openweight quad category so we did
pretty well
now our eight is racing today and we're
cheering for them so that's really
exciting I just can't believe he's
Nationals is coming to a close so
quickly because last year
Lucy and I raced in the lightweight
double and last year you Nationals was
in California so that was so so fun
because Lucy Knight never been to
California now it's like a whole new
experience with like a bunch of girls
cuz we have any any quads there's like
13 girls so it's been really fun and I
hope you guys enjoyed all the little
video I had put together and all the
pictures of us because it's been so much
fun just bonding with my girls and for a
lot of people that aren't rowing over
the summer this is gonna be like our
last time all rowing together because a
lot of us are seniors including myself
we're going off to college in the fall
and going to row at a different program
so I can't really think about not rowing
with these girls anymore because I love
them all so so much this is what I don't
want to leave
we got beat yesterday after a raise it
was just amazing and I'm like all backed
up and I'm just editing videos had a lot
of down time I was here it was for
arresting and stuff so I've been editing
videos like crazy
I love it here it's so nice honey
I think I belong somewhere more of my
love for mother okay before I bla bla
way too long thank you so much for
watching I hope you guys really enjoyed
it and for any of you that competed at
Youth Nationals I hope you all had an
amazing time just like me thank you so
much for watching and I always hear my
