I say I'm so out of it right now it's
like 11:00 I just barely got up but I
just call my uber and I'm actually
running to the bus station right now
because I'm going back to Albany even
though I just got back to Boston
yesterday because I have to go back for
an appointment and I was in Albany for
like two days and I was back in Austin
per day now I'm going back to Albany for
a day and then I'm coming back to Boston
it's very complicated
but I gotta go meet my bus but I just
wanted to say good morning and I didn't
fall yesterday because it was like a
mess of me just like trying to get back
to Boston early early in the morning and
then I had Tufts formal with Aaron and
it was so much fun I wanted certain
pictures right here but yeah we're gonna
go home now
so I'm back in Albany again and it's
been quite a stressful day so far I've
been back for two hours and I'm not
gonna bore you with the details because
no one wants to explain but just know
that buying car was a lot harder than
you would expect and there's a goal lot
that goes into it which obviously I know
like interns just paperwork and
everything and I'm like and then another
one that I was like very certain that I
was gonna get cuz you guys remember the
other day
there was that one I was ending it
nearby and then it just sold and then I
called the dealership today and they're
like can't we have it and then later
they were like oh nope it's sold so I'm
over it but that's okay we're gonna keep
moving on my parents are like it's like
looking at a house oh you don't get the
first one you'll get like you whatever
but good news is is also I was starving
I was about to eat my arm for lunch and
it's like 5:00 p.m. now luckily and then
there's like tax things I just had to go
to H&amp;amp;R Block office and oh my god oh my
god I have to go straight and there's
we're never gonna make it to the mall no
no and also it's been raining so bad so
there's like accidental accidents I've
seen literally ten accidents today and
avoided like wait what was I saying
oh but good news days were going to the
mall yay oh and next to the H&amp;amp;R Block
office said I was that there was a
Pokeball place thank goodness and it
really it was like highly mediocre
probably would not recommend it it was
food okay so I'm not starving anymore
why are we back here awesome
oh yeah what is it now yes lucy has to
go to pants and get stuff and I got to
get air pods and we're just having
students build a weird it screaming why
why at the end of every step this is
what happens to me why does your hip
hurt okay we're gonna find some fun
things to vlog later so the visit isn't
a depressing okay oh wait I noticed
right close to the vlog of you the other
day
turn on Air Force One is this still
about show me that I don't know if we
talked about it more if you like Gotham
or anything but you ordered them right
no I
but you said you did Lucy is ordering
apparently think Lucy's trying out every
sweatshirt in the store
literally I like that one it's comfy
yeah and I like how big it is it's big
comfy so if you just got one second of
me getting air phones I literally don't
know they're over here I want to show
you guys then I don't really know much
about them
all I know is that Maggie has them and
loves them and then I asked y'all's
opinion and everyone said that I needed
them in Danielle Callie was like you
really need them so I'm happy that I got
him okay now we're at oh wait that's at
Supercuts
polar head Trader Joe's and I've just
been in the car because I was facetiming
Taylor but Lucy is inside and inside
shopping and before I face them together
I was on the phone with like a car
dealer who like maybe found one that I
want but it's 7 o'clock right now and
they closed a so I want to go look at it
right now because I want to leave
tomorrow afternoon to go back to Boston
it might act like it's gonna be a
miracle if you can like get the whole
car buying process done in like a day
like that doesn't happen but yeah I'm
gonna try to figure it out because hi
I'm on a car and I want to drive back to
Boston and today's just been a ball of
stress but like I said tomorrow I mean
not tomorrow later tonight we need to do
something that's like purposely for fun
so that we stop dressing but it's great
because I was looking at Julia knows
talking to her and I went Lucy know did
you say first when every second would
know I never know the look
I feel like whenever I've gone to have a
drive-thru like once in my life like I
never know yeah okay this is the fun I
was talking about Lucy was dropping me
off at the BMW dealership which is right
across the way oh my god no tell them I
went to the trees are lots of fun
oh yeah Lucy my eyes hurt that's how
about me five nine okay this is the fun
I was talking about because there's
McDonald's across the street and I was
like we're going cuz is he hungry and
she can't eat a french fries or
franchisors no good and I got a little
chicken nugget I have a chicken I feel
like somebody here their friend's house
I'm vegan but I think they're supposed
to be vegan then I just say there be
like what some of them mix in like
chicken
french fries I know don't yell at Lucy
in this can't raise my opinion thank you
sue I don't oh it does smell like
McDonald's I haven't even thought Oh
Lucy if the french fries aren't
perfectly vegan because she's about to
die she's so hungry right Lou no I would
be like broccoli or cauliflower I don't
like either of those raw and I mean big
carrots I'm just using these french
fries you always tell Eddie
this is a fun that we needed after a
stressful day there's the car dealership
and now we've seen me or have a gas
station because we needed water Lucy I
just saw mommy drive in there she's
gonna be a where aren't you
I've been waiting forever Oh shiny my
new credit card is yeah that's funny
thank goodness
guess who made me like smart water yeah
you know people are really so down about
hearing about them they like changed my
life Wow Wow that's so crazy what we see
me we're like Oh Lucy throw over the
curb Lucy me really oh my god it's so
cold on my legs I feel so gross right
now we just ate McDonald's french fries
my hair feels greasy and I just feel
disgusting wanna know what I actually
know I'm so proud of you sweetie no it
is not for me for them no you totally
can don't worry go after this one so
guys sorry like this vlog has been all
over the place I pimple come I remember
that huge pimple had on my cheek
hopefully it's gone in the morning but
um okay yeah so I'm gonna try to make
this quick cuz I look really not cute
now this is the real meat and I finally
showered thank God because I felt so
after we ate McDonald's fries and just
yeah um but I went out to the car and my
mom was like I don't think this is a car
for you you wanted look at new wear one
with Les Miles but I'm like I just
really like it and I don't want to wait
around for one to like for like someone
to sell their old one if that makes
sense because I've tried it by pre-owned
so I saved money um I'm trying to be I
don't know
with the word that I'm thinking of
trying to be like responsible not
responsible
not like frugal but practical I'm trying
to be practical because I don't need to
buy like a brand new one when like I
could buy one that's like a year or two
old and like there's literally no
difference you know what I mean um oh
yeah and I asked the guy like what's the
difference between 2015 2016 2017 2018
and he's like literally no difference
except for like the front of the car
kind of looks a little different which I
noticed and then I think this is like a
sign too before I even knew about it
Taylor was telling you how she liked the
older versions better that like she
liked the way the 2014-2015 ones looked
in the front better than like the newer
ones which I kind of agreed so then I
feel like and what the one today and I
test drove it I was like oh my gosh and
like I wish I could've brought you guys
but I just knew that I wasn't gonna be
my blog camera I'm like this is just not
the time when I'm like really stressed
and like need to focus I'm looking at a
car my mom is like super skeptical and
is like I'm not about it I don't even
like it that much but I'm like no I love
it and I need a so we will see tomorrow
if I get a car and like in my mind I
just go and pay and like get the keys
but my parents were like no Gretchen
like usually you go and you like
typically traditionally P by a car tell
me this is right I think this is right
that you go oh my god I have one more
pimple cream over here I kind of went in
it's Mario Badescu drying lotion but um
you'll like go and you like get the car
but then they're like okay pick it up
and they get soon it's like two days
because they have to like do stuff with
like the Department of Motor Vehicles
and like insurance and stuff I don't
even know so we will see but my big idea
is like go by tomorrow me like drive
back to Boston already and when I'm
trying to figure out parking for Boston
because that's gonna be a wreck but
that's okay um so yeah we shall see but
I just want to end off today's vlog I
know it was probably very horrible in
the beginning to watch because Lucy me
I'd like a really hard beginning of the
day and really expressed and crying and
stuff but then end it out okay because I
went I looked at a car we ate some
french fries and all as well so yeah
guys so much nothing you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
