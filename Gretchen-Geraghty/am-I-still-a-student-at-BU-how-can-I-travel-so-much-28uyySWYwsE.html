this video at all which seems really
scary right now but as you can tell this
video is just going to be a little life
update and I've been wanting to film
this for a while now actually ever since
the day I got back from PV but now
that's like a while ago now I think I
got back
March 15th yeah and now it's March 26
I'm gonna upload this like right after I
tell them I'm just gonna take up a
little memory card job in my computer
and upload it which is gonna be really
new and weird for me um you can tell
here I am back in Boston again March 26
I just got back from Miami on Saturday
and let's just answer the questions
right away without any more fluff I've
been getting an overwhelming amount of
questions asking if I'm still a student
at BU if I'm still gonna graduate on
time if I'm still in the business school
just how I can travel so much how I
afford it how just like so many
questions about that so I joined to sit
down and answer it because everyone's
freaking out on me so answer number one
yes I'm still a full-time student at BU
yes I'm still in the business school I'm
still going to graduate on time don't
worry I know everyone's so worried about
it especially since a couple of weeks
ago I made a video talking about how I
dropped my finance concentration and I
actually got a lot of backlash from that
video that I wasn't like expecting at
all and I just was kind of promoting
saying like if you're not happy in your
life like make the changes you know that
you need to make to like make yourself
happy and there was a period in my life
I'll just mention this very very very
briefly and it was the beginning of my
sophomore year of college and I was very
unhappy and I made like three very big
changes that I know I talked about for
Brooke with the boyfriend changed my
major quit rowing and those were like
the best things they could have done for
myself and because of that I'm like such
much more happier person now and
whatever that just like set me on the
right path you know what I'm saying so
long story short that's why I dropped my
finance concentration because I was
concentrating and marketing and finance
and just wasn't feeling finance anymore
it wasn't like interesting to me anymore
like it used to be and I didn't need to
concentration so I'm just doing
marketing not that marketing isn't
challenging like marketing and finance
together we're both very challenging and
now marketing by itself it's still very
challenging I mean college isn't easy
you know what I'm saying so for people
saying that like not everyone can just
drop things when they get hard or
you know not do things that like
challenge themselves like you're
supposed to challenge yourself and put
yourself like I get that like I'm still
pushing myself but luckily because of
that I was able to make it so I only
have classes Monday Wednesday now and
that's pretty much the reason why I'm
able to travel so much because like for
Miami I didn't miss any school will be
left Wednesday afternoon I got back
Saturday morning so like things like
that I don't miss much school when I
went to PD with Tasha that was a trip
that I had known that I was going to go
on for a while and literally if you guys
like talked to your professors I feel
like professors know that you're human
too like there are also humans and they
get it and they get that like we all
have our own lives and stuff and
especially my situation like trying to
do YouTube full-time with school and
like being able to travel because
traveling is something that I love doing
so much and obviously you guys can tell
that I love doing it so much I like
literally can't sit still and have been
like so many places in the last couple
of months which I'm like beyond grateful
and blessed to be able to do and when I
see comments with people being like just
thinking that I'm not grateful or
thankful or anything that like literally
kills me because so the reason I wanted
to make this video when I was on the
flight back from PV I literally was like
crying in the flight home I'm a very
emotional person if you guys know me um
my Lydia was crying on the flight home
because I was just thinking of like how
truly grateful and blessed I am and like
thankful that I'm able to travel and
just like live my life the way I want to
and I don't know I just like feel like
overwhelmingly like happy all the time
and you guys know I'm like a happy
person but I feel like I'm oh he's like
choosing to be happy and I know not
everyone can I don't know this is all
over the place um but I just like really
try to focus on what makes me happy and
so since I like traveling so much and
since that makes me happy and even
though I'm young and in college and
stuff I still try to make it work so
that is how I travel so much I you know
I just make it work my professors
understand like I told my luxury
marketing professor and the very
beginning the semester hey I know I'm
going on a trip to Mexico that week I
know that's when I'm midterm exam is and
I was able to make it up later on you
know what I mean so that's that's how
I'm able to do it like I'm really not
missing that much school and the school
that I am missing my professors are
really understanding and can work with
me
here and there so yeah but I'm doing
that but other than that life is good
I'm living
no makeup right now I just want to be
like really real with you guys I'm sorry
I'm really all over the place you're
gonna be able to tell without editing
just like how all over the place I am
but love me or hate me this is how I am
yeah I literally put no makeup I just
got back from Chipotle with Arlen we had
a fun little chat yeah I also don't have
eyelash extensions anymore I'd handle I
pulled out the rest cuz they're driving
me crazy which like don't do that it's
so bad for your eyes but I did so that's
why I literally have no eyelashes um
what else do I want to talk to you guys
about I think I wrote down some of it oh
well when I was like really emotional on
that flight back from TV you guys know
this on plans by elefante or if you
don't know it like go listen to it
because it's like my favorite song ever
and I was like writing down quotes in
this song and I was just like crying
even more I'm so emotional but it's like
I don't let this moment slip out through
my hands and I'm like that's literally
how I feel like I'm just trying to like
live my life the best I can right now
and just like literally take advantage
of like every opportunity I have because
I mean I just heard 21 I'm only 21 for
so long and you know what I mean like I
don't want to look back and wish that I
did anything different and I've just
like come to the realization that like
I'm so happy in my life right now I
could cry like people that in my life I
love so much and I'm so like content and
again like thankful and grateful for
like everything in my life that's like
allowed me to get here especially you
guys in YouTube like I honestly have no
idea where I would be right now like
without YouTube like it's so crazy to
think about like my life would be so
different and the people that are in my
life and like my friends and stuff like
are like Maggie I'm not like I literally
would have never met them without
YouTube you know what I mean so I don't
know just like stuff like that and I'm
just like so happy I could cry and I
would not change a single thing right
now I mean other than I have like
extreme FOMO always and so when I'm like
always traveling and stuff I get sad
that I'm not like here for you with my
like wonderful roommates because I love
them so much but I wrote down some
things I want to make sure I covered in
this video
because I knew I just knew I would be
all over the place what am i right okay
yeah so how I can travel so much I
pretty much talked about that I don't
have a much class whatever um I know I'm
very behind on vlogs right now because
editing is really like the bottleneck in
this whole process here and that's why
I'm not gonna edit this I'm just gonna
throw it right up so I know I'm behind
on vlogs but I'm really trying to catch
up so that like you guys are living your
life with me and stuff and that's why I
like that I'm just gonna put this up
right now because it's just like real
and raw and today and you know how I'm
feeling in this very second you know
anything Oh
also this week is like crazy busy for me
so I feel like I'm not gonna be that
present on social media it's actually
like big little weak for my sorority and
I'm how I'm gonna freak out I'm so
excited so that's why I'm just not gonna
be around that much because I'm just
busy preparing and such yeah oh wait I
also wrote this down this is another
thing I wanted to say so for people
there was like a couple comments on
recent instagrams that made me like
really sad and hurt and I know some
people are saying like actually like
overwhelmingly on my last couple videos
like people will be like oh Gretchen
doesn't prioritize her education at all
she's literally just like traveling and
like drinking or whatever and that like
really hurts me because obviously I
prioritize my education if I'm here I'm
still a full-time student yes I travel
but like I found a way and a balance
that I can make it work and I think a
big thing that people maybe don't know
and my friends are like you should tell
YouTube this so that they know how much
you care about school like I pay for my
own tuition you really is not cheap at
all and I want you guys to know that
just because I do take it that seriously
and obviously I'm that thankful and
grateful to be here and like I'm so
lucky that I am able to pay for my own
tuition so I don't want anyone to think
that I don't want to be here and people
are like you're like wasting your
parents money like they're not paying
money for me to be here it's me it's my
decision to be here and if I didn't want
to be here I would have dropped out so
for everyone saying like I'm not
prioritizing my education I am and
that's why I'm here and I know a degree
is important and I really enjoy learning
I think learning about marketing is like
literally the most interesting thing
ever like my luxury marketing class I
just had consumer behavior marketing
today like it's literally some of the
most interesting stuff that I've learned
and I just think that it's really
awesome I'm going to my luxury marketing
class really soon tonight actually but I
don't dispute year long I'd already
talked for eight minutes and 42 seconds
but I love you guys so so much literally
you're the best ever I hope
but this came off in the right way and
stuff and I just wanted to tell you love
life update I'm happy that's how I can
travel so much I'm still soon MPO
surprise I'm still here yeah that's
pretty much it okay thank you guys so
much watching I'll see you next video
