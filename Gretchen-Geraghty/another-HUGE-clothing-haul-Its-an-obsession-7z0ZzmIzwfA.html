you guessed it it I've just been so into
getting a new clothes for the fall
season and for back-to-school so it's an
addition everything that I got with you
guys so we did some inspiration for
yourself and you go back to school or we
can tell them you can get the same
clothes in case you're entering the
romper I'm wearing right now it's so
cute it's like pretty cool it blew my
strength it's for funny bone so
definitely check out my last video where
I show at this room right so the first
time I got a super boot oh and before I
forget to mention everything in this
haul video will be a link down below
it's definitely check it out if you're
interested in some of the pieces I shall
first time I got from Zulu it just is
really cute camera top and I got
inspired by my cousin manatees to me
camel always seemed kind of like harsh
and I was scared and it was my darling
there for me but this I thought was
perfect because the tan is kind of like
a pinky tan so they mix a lot more
feminine I love this top I think Cameron
is so in right now then I just got my
got remove oh it's just this white
cropped t-shirt and I love that the
sleeves have a little rollover detail I
think that always makes sure it's
legendary about just me I didn't have
like just a plain white cropped t-shirt
so I needed this and this is like I'm so
excited about and don't even know what
to call it like a vest duster cardigan
thing and that's one thing I want to
mention about boobs their rights are so
affordable I think it's really good to
get stuff for booboo that's like really
trendy right now because you don't have
to go buying it from some other like
crazy expensive and then you get like
because it's like a really crazy trend
so that's why I just think the blue is
still good for letting stuff like this
my boss Warren at doe who's actually
wearing one that was so similar to this
it separators more like a cream color
and I was so inspired by that because
I've never seen like anything like it
and then when I saw this time to do it I
was like this it's such a beautiful like
tan rose color never move I just got
this big white and that's a t-shirt and
my uncle actually the massive t-shirt
that I always loved I was like okay I
need it - big t-shirts like this I kind
of graphic t-shirts you can really like
dress up with like black ripped skinny
jeans and like little booties or you can
obviously wear it to bed or like more
casual in this skirt is so perfect my
mom was like cringing that is so
beautiful
and this is so similar to the Topshop
one that I wanted but the Topshop one is
like so expensive and it's so much
literally just like it way more
affordable so cute and I'll definitely
be wearing a bunch in the fall maybe
some like baggy Cree sweaters let's
leave these black pants we're such a
steal how huge so this is what I came
out with trendy stuff but it's perfect
to just grab from boof and they go
little bit more high waisted up if
there's stretch your own beliefs they
can fit before and afters any move again
with the tassels I got this white short
sleeve dress it's just really simple but
with the tassels at the bottom I think
it makes it really unique and cute then
I just got
really baggy light wash up boyfriend
jeans and maybe a little written to me
and they're pumped up the bottom but
they're so baggy because the more baggy
the more comfy needs a really nice
quality they're like really thick nice
actually running a black and white
getting dressed like this for so long I
saw this movie I was like now it's a
time girl I love that trying to like
straight across and necklines then this
blue and white stripe John suit how cute
and also on the website I thought it
would be like a more like stiff like
chiffon material but it's so stretchy
and comfy which I'm so happy about my
honest white denim jacket and it's kind
of distressed looking it's just the
right amount of baggy on me so I love it
it reminds me so much of the one at me
though
which I always thought was so cute but
obviously so it's like this and it's me
Mel so this is perfect then I got this
black denim overall style dress it was
time for me to get my head alright
moving on the rest of the stuff I'm
going to be showing you is from chi in
and i don't know what you guys but for a
while I was kind of like skeptical if
she and I was like and I don't know it's
like too good to be true their stuff is
so affordable and I don't know I've kind
of thought of it is look a little bit
sketchy but then again Tasha she has had
so many haul videos showing that she and
stuff that it's so cute and then like
being with her in person and she's very
very stuff I'm like that's still cute is
definitely people and she's like no it's
their machine so I was like okay I need
like a top on this trend it gets her
from Xin and try it out for myself
because Tasha is the best stuff from
there so the first thing I got obviously
Tasha already has it it's just this
yellow and white kind of smooth ticking
on top I seriously think it's so perfect
it's so flattering I love the way it
fits and a little bonus is that it came
with this yellow and wait getting them
at skirt and you can wear them kind of
like separated so you can see your
stomach or you can like tuck this into
the bottom of this and it looks more
like a dress and mrs. skirt when I saw
on she and I was like whoa baby
my friends fair
actually had this exact skirt from free
people and this would've looked exactly
the same guys it's definitely the same
this is obviously so much cheaper sense
tarnishing and I love what the details
how it laces up on the side and I love
like the embroidered flowers obviously
like the lookit is so key open next time
shin you can never have too many tequila
blue pad and this I actually haven't had
one that looks like this in a parent I
actually harder to have one that looks
like this book currently these mines I'm
feel like place up in the middle or kind
of supposed to make it realistic
they're so sticky which is so nice
because do hate when your little sticky
boob has become unsticky and then you
can't even my room anymore that's just
the end and then I was looking at she
and I saw this really cool peplum top
I've never seen anything like this it's
kind of like hi-low also so it goes way
longer in the back and then it's like
shorter in the front and I thought it
was so cool and I have to try to help
it's kind of thinner material so it was
like really wrinkly when I'm trying on
but all I really have to do is iron it
then I got this black floral dress which
I totally took inspiration from Lucy who
just got a black floral wrap dress but
her is her Abercrombie obviously way
more expensive than machine one and it
looks just like it and I love it's like
a black dress trend that's going on
because I can be so cute and if you saw
my last haul with honey booboo
obsessed with matching set you got this
red little matching set
just plural kind of lace up the front as
a little flare sleeve which I love
super crop so it goes perfect with the
matching we will arrive it's George and
I cannot wait to wear this in this tank
top I've actually had mixed feelings
about so I saw the website and I was
like together this is so unique and I
haven't seen - sure everything looks
like this it kind of runs intimate you
might find it like me well I'm really a
nice embroidering like doughnut front
and across this guy right there and it
has tassels as well when I tried it on I
was like this is perfect with all for
sure where this to class and the
business who I think it's definitely
appropriate but also like fun it's been
the very last thing I have to show you
guys it's just looks like banana leaf
print one piece and I actually need a
girl in my sorority series I copy
everyone she dear had this one everyone
really similar to this because now just
thinking on that's totally why I wanted
to get this because I saw her picture in
it I'm like wow it's so cute cuz it's
super nice body like it's crazy for the
press because it's like double rise and
like really thick and nice and there's
like eh details over on the side and I
really have like one flat one piece so I
thought it was time to get another cool
fashionable one so yeah that is
everything I got from the boohoo and she
and like I said everything will be
linked down below in case you are
interested in
to me yeah thank you guys so much
