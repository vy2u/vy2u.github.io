different than my normal type of videos
sometimes need to be serious I'm just
going to be telling you guys about
childhood cancer obviously we all know a
child with cancer is an awful awful
thing all types of cancer are just
terrible I'm involved with the B+ and a
ssin and the B plasters B+ foundation it
was started by Andrew McDonough's
parents and Andrew Madonna died at the
age of 14 of leukemia which makes my
heart so sad his parents really try to
keep his legacy going by creating this
foundation which just pushes people to
stay positive because he was always such
a happy person so that's why it's called
it to be positive foundation as well as
his blood type is also it would be
positive so I'll have a link down below
it to their video talking about Andrew
stories before I get too far into this
video I just want you guys know there is
a giveaway at the end so stay tuned for
that it's a really big one if you guys
don't know already in the middle of May
I will be traveling to Tanzania in
Africa to hike Mount Kilimanjaro the
whole purpose of this trip is to fund
raise money for the beef plus Foundation
because I know a lot of people were kind
of confused about that before when I
made my video talking I'm going to
Africa so actually I've already donated
since is a organization film near and
dear to my heart and I plan on donating
again I just know personally so many
people affected by cancer people in my
family my friends and I know you guys
have two parents siblings pediatric or
childhood cancer especially I can't
imagine the feeling of a parent being
told that their child has cancer
donating to this foundation is such a
special important thing and not too long
ago a lot you can see a nice desk TED
talk you guys obviously know caseous I
digress but there was one part in his
TED talk I'm not looking down below I
was talking about obligation and
opportunity
Kansas whole idea about winning the
lotto on life Ellis whoa it really just
changed the way I thought about things
he was just saying I did nothing to
deserve to be born into a middle-class
family in America where there's just so
much opportunity waiting for us just to
put it into perspective I remember he
was talking about delivering morphine to
people in Africa dying as AIDS so that
they could die with dignity
like can you even imagine he talked
specifically about this 20 year old girl
that was born in the shack and she was
raped as a teenager and he or she is
dying of AIDS he said you know I won the
lotto on life this girl did
a lot of one life she was born with a
terrible lotto ticket you could think
that you have so many problems but if
you weren't born in this Shack in Uganda
and dying of AIDS at age 20 and you're
born into a family that loves you like
you did win the lotto on life it's all
just chance and just luck where you're
born into this world Casey was even
saying the worst that could happen is
maybe I live in a trailer park maybe I'm
on welfare but that's still not as bad
as the 20 year old girl so when this
opportunity that were born with an
opportunity that's always constantly
around us he says that as humans we have
an obligation to take that and that
really spoke to me and I was like what
am i doing that's these other things too
when you have opportunities take them
but I feel like I have a higher moral
obligation especially with my platform
with you guys to do something good with
it and to make a difference and to give
back because that's what really matters
that you can help me fundraise money to
my trip to Africa and donate to the beat
plus foundation by clicking the link it
can be the first link in the description
box down below I have three giveaway
prizes I just got the iPad Mini just
looks like this it's the white one I
think it's just silver on the back so I
also want to get you okay so I saw this
really cute mint green one it's like
magnetic so it'll like turn off your
iPad for you a second place prize I got
you guys a pair of ray-bans all black
aviators are just a polarized standard
sized ones and then the third place
prize I'm equally excited about that you
guys this hydro flask and just like mint
green as you guys know I have this exact
one but in white and the way to enter
into this giveaway is give the donate
five dollars to the first link I will
have in the description box which again
is just to fundraise money for my trip
to Africa and to donate money into a
childhood cancer research so $5 is a
magic number to enter you into this
giveaway and as an incentive to donate
more as you can every $5 you donate
after the first five dollars it's going
to be another entry into the giveaway
but I know the majority of you watching
this video or my maybe you're a
sophomore in college like me was not a
lot of spending money and I totally get
that I tried to figure out a way so that
everyone could win so what I came up
with is I actually ordered 700 of these
red little bracelets they're kind of
like the LIVESTRONG type you know what I
mean I saw mine and I customized them so
the front of them it just says it be
positive and all lowercase just in white
letters are just more
like this and then since they're coming
from me on the back it just says at GLB
so I thought these bracelets would be a
really good way to give back to you guys
for donating with each bracelet that I'm
a lot you guys it's going to come with a
note for me so that you just know how
thankful I am for you yes I know it's
probably going to take me a while to ish
about 700 bracelets I don't even know
700 of you were going to donate if more
of you donate I can always order more
bracelets and it's less than $700 you
donate that's okay I guess I'll just
have some extra today is February 1st
and I just wanted to film this video
today and preserve it today for you guys
because length of this giveaway is going
to last from February 1st all the way
through at February 28th so there's the
whole month of February so firstly sighs
I found Minuit case second place prize
black 88 Arabians with case third place
prize hydroflax oh and I also if you
couldn't tell it comes with like the
sippy top because mine has a sippy top
and the sippy top is where it's at so
figured you would want it to be tall but
just like me
the first rule to enter the giveaway is
obviously you have to donate the $5 and
I'll know that you enter once you donate
money because they'll get an email with
your name so you'll be automatically
entered that way and then remember each
$5 if you donate after the first five
dollars will enter you and just give
away again so you're more likely to win
so if you donate like a hundred dollars
will get entered 20 times you will
probably win I that okay make sure you
have your parent's permission if you're
not 18 make sure to get your donations
in by February 28th then I'll take the
winners on March 1st and I will amend
the description box to this video to
have the three names of the winners so
on March 1st definitely come back to
this video check out the description to
see if you have been picked as I
mentioned before the B+ foundation is
such an amazing foundation interview
Jonah's parents have done it such an
amazing job and helping other families
with kids with childhood cancer and just
honoring Andrew I feel so lucky that I'm
able to share this with you guys and
just use my platform for something
important like this so thank you guys so
much for watching this video and I'll
see you my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
