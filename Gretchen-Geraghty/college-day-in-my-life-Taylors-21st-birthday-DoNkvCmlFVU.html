I'm tired you get out it's um
I'm treinta is it like a 7:30 right now
and Megan's running around because it's
Talia's very nice that we're decorating
her room but I did yes you let go of the
balloon but I'm like running to class
right now but her rooms gonna be so cute
and Taylor always does solo minutes
after they left so Megan was gonna
decorate her room then
but of course Taylor is like coming back
oh my god of course okay
I wish I could stay in hell but it's
really like the one day I had class and
I wonder my supposed to I don't leave me
now so guys I'm in school yes right now
I think it's so early
like no one's here so I could spell it
was fun I like never film in class ever
and I really wanted to today it was for
little cuz it was like so interesting
and active and calm so I feel like I was
a distracted I just don't really we
would just like talk and that would pay
attention but you know to me if I give
you have a friend in classics like you
pay attention us I was just texting
about all the stuff because it was like
so interesting and I'm like I am like so
taking her psychology classes here at BU
I wish I could like minor
it was most interesting thing we learned
about toxoplasmosis and how it affects
like pregnant moms and their kids having
skipped sunny and just like what is all
about schizophrenia and like in like all
these drugs and stuff which I was it
what I was it was really like
interesting I don't know I just learned
how much stuff I didn't know and I'm
scared cuz I grew up with a cat and so
they never I'm pregnant
I might actually horses that's right
that's what we're thinking right now but
don't worry was like oh in my professor
so that like so many people have taxes I
can't have anything but anyway I'm
leaving now because I'm going into a
slow cycle and I my shoes with me and I
suffer like four or five hours because I
like staying when I watch TV TV is I get
sucked into the you to what but so tired
but I'm really excited because I'm going
with Johnny
and I don't know where it is do you guys
hate when it's raining anybody nubert
because in there like eighty million
dollars more you're dreaming and then
everyone the worst but yeah I like never
felt one canvas so here we are I guess
five home early enough we're chillin we
can we just this Range Rover so Q I
don't know if I should show who lies and
sleep but that's a really cute Range
Rover and I don't want it
oh yeah let's get it have you ever been
soul cycle have you ever been to soul
cycle
you can try it it's so close
yeah you get really sweaty good great
and it makes you in such a good mood it
just seems like really hot in the class
you know because you after you work out
you get all your like endorphins and
everything the best care I just got back
on campus and I'm going to our gym
because they have a smoothie bar and I
want to smoothie if you go to be you get
the smoothies from fit rec and get the
Green Monster that's so good
it looks kind of black it always dies
because they do a bunch of mixed berries
and then I think the spinach it's just
like it makes very sprit inch and then I
think like almond milk I what it tastes
good when they make it I haven't made
like a smoothie or a smoothie Bowl and
so long you guys know I was like queen
of tables I don't know why I just been
like lazy that's pretty much why cuz
it's kind of like effort 10:58 and I
have to shower I can do some things and
yeah but I didn't have class
red-breasted it which is nice I'm gonna
meet up with NAT a bit later though so
that we're gonna start something for
psych exam because our psych final it's
really just our third exam because our
psych class is 33% like just each is
each examine 33% because there's three
exams so it's kind of like
nerve-wracking and like the second one I
have to go super taking an exam and
you're like I studied so much I
literally know everything and I like
finishes so quick and I was like that
was in the easiest thing ever and I was
like I'm literally gonna get 100 like
that's a joke I definitely I 100 if I
did not do well and I was like it's
never happened that's so frustrating I'm
like I literally knew all this stuff I
studied and like I felt so confident
taking it so then now didn't I do well I
don't know so basically it's like I feel
like is just so interesting to me that I
think that I like know it really well
but maybe I actually don't I don't know
so we're gonna start studying even
though we're exam kind of seems far away
but it's really not it's really I mean
table 26 on my exams
they first can you believe it's almost
9:00 where is it I'm going their mess oh
why they went because I went to start Oh
you that so that I know I'm like I when
I went to class this morning it am like
the first time I ever went it was so
rainy and now it's like beautiful
obviously wait Megan I wish I went to
cost more and that we have it more
because it was so interesting we learned
all about
oh my knife root it's called tax wait I
texted it to my family and they're like
what are you talking about
and I'm like just listen guys it was so
interesting tact toxoplasmosis it's like
this thing it's as parasite and like
these parasites he's like these
parasites are smarter than like all the
psychologists in like the world because
they've just like as they've evolved
they are like so smart and they know how
to let keep living and guess where they
breathe in cats stomachs that's like the
only place where they can like throught
like I don't know like reproduce I guess
and then cats will like poop and then
that's how they like spread and then
they like and they also are there in
mice too
and so then that's why cats eat mice or
that's how like the parasite need to go
into mice because in cats eat them and
then like and when they're in the mice
mice or afraid of cats but then when
parasites are in the mice they're not
afraid of the cat so then the cats eat
them like it makes them not afraid
because it goes in this one part of
their brain that controls that makes
them like not afraid and it actually
makes them like sexually attracted to
the cats isn't that weird so crazy it's
like he was just saying all of this and
I was like what are you talking about I
guess he like research it so much it's
like all this crazy stuff happens and
when when humans have toxoplasmosis they
like half of humans have done because
like if you have a cat growing up or
something like you probably get it
because you are like around them and
like I don't know you can be exposed to
it like we probably have it we don't
even know he's in half female I guess
I'm scared I have it but like you know
whoa I did growing up George but like
it's okay
but if you're like pregnant it can like
affect like your child but it's not that
bad but if you get it while you're
pregnant it's worse
and then you're kicking out will be more
like the deaf schizophrenia and like
we're learning all about how your kids
might have schizophrenia and then if you
have if you have twins that are
identical then if one gets schizophrenia
the other one is like fifty fifty fifty
can I have schizophrenia and then if
they're fraternal it's like fourteen
percent why don't I remember all of this
I just thought it was the coolest thing
ever
what cool but just like anything yeah
literally I'm like why are we in the
visiting school psychology is way cooler
anyways just talking out all these
studies I'm like I don't know it's
really interesting anyway I will stop or
you lecture on like cat pooping rather
you like literally if it's on bad I know
everything about it it was just so
interesting and then it said like when
people have talked so plasmosis like the
part of your brain that it infects it
like it's like serotonin or dopamine I
don't really know what I'm saying but
also right before all about that we
learned about every drug and like how
elite filler like addictive it is and
like alcohol was it really high up for
like lethal which is true because if you
like drink way too much alcohol you can
like actually diet what people do
obviously and then it said that
marijuana was less addictive than
caffeine or like less lethal like how
weird is that I don't know be like guys
for marijuana do just have like weird it
just is with it yeah I mean if you are
use not even like that bad for you and
it makes people have like increased like
like memory and like function and stuff
so I'm like maybe I should try to drink
coffee but then you get addicted to it
yeah it's for your body to detox and not
by now I thought I had to do and people
like Shane get mad and like like I am
eBay I actually like lights get really
bright yes I don't have coffee with
thirty minutes of waking up I just can't
function yeah oh my god that's like
everyone I feel like but it's like my
whole family my dad drinks like four
years of coffee every morning really
they said they said you he said you can
overdose on caffeine like it's like
possible but it would never happen to
anyone he said you have to drink a
hundred cups of coffee in one sitting
yeah like what like creatine pills and
like no but like if you're taking
caffeine pills like drinking a Red Bull
and like it's like some it's like a
thousand something milligrams I think
yeah that's so unlike a diet coke only
has like seventy six milligrams I like
don't drink caffeine ever but I I feel
like I drink caffeine because I'm always
I think things possible that's why I
don't need it and I've been around
caffeine and that is a big crazy person
all I drink is water and I'm still like
a psycho
excited drinking coffee but I was like
in high school so I don't even know what
life is like without it's just like a
couple hours later I showered and just
put on literally like a summery outfit
because I'm gonna go meet Maddie B and
we're gonna study and just hang out at
Todd say I gotta go because poor nanny's
been waiting for me I've been just
trying to do stuff I wanted to have a
productive afternoon where I did a lot
of things but sometimes your plans just
don't happen how you want them to when I
got some pretty horrible like
devastating news and that really needed
me to say that and not be able to tell
you but it's like super personal and
just like family stuff so I spent a lot
of time being sad and crying but now I'm
better and you just have to like really
think positive really in life if you can
bring yourself to do it and realize that
some things are out of your control and
that's all and I just wanted to say that
I'm really thankful for my family and
friends in my life
and you guys do because you're my
friends and you're there for me and
thanks for being you and yeah that's all
I'm gonna say about that but yeah okay
now I'm in Taylor's room and I just want
to show you guys
