bed it is 10:30 and this is so I'm like
me no when I get up earlier and when you
know get after the day go to the gym or
whatever but some days you just have to
reward yourself by getting some rest
because so many of us don't sleep enough
I know I don't so typical college
boarding routine I get up with my alarm
blaring snoozing it a million times but
today I decided I can sleep in because I
don't have a class until 12:30 so
sometimes you just gotta get your body
what deserves and that is some sleep ona
I don't know if you can tell but I just
got back from Aruba
so my shoulder is a struggling it's just
so bad and it's just peeling and don't
worry I'm like covering my body and like
lotion but I'm still paying oh my gosh
it why are you like this I did not take
off my makeup last night I sometimes I
forget because I'm just so dang tired
and I get home but I just fall asleep
but I know it's really bad look at how
pretty my view is guys I always leave my
a big huge window like my whole wall is
windows right there and I'll leave that
one open so that natural light can like
wake me up in the morning because I
noticed I wake up easier and like with
more energy than an alarm does that even
make sense like I have to have an alarm
too or else I'll just like sleep all day
um but I noticed that like if it's
bright and light in my room
I like wake up easier yeah so that's
that you know let's like get up I hate
getting out of my cozy little burrito we
gotta go take over Meghan Gretchen why
are you like this do you guys hear that
yourself every day - kiss me - my skin
is just so dry look at that I'm not
complaining though it's no one's fault
but my own wait why am I even taking it
off cuz I'm just about to like put it
back on again
I should just left it on that's what you
think about when you're extremely lazy
did I know I'm going to be brushing my
teeth
pretty normal yeah
me it's a miracle isn't brushing your
teeth you can't go out out
I'll fresh Oh God so oh my God why don't
you tell me I'm like horrible
just look up um whenever I wake up I'm
starving like even if I eat an entire
pizza like three and the night before I
always make a punker you no matter what
it's just how I am so what I realized in
college is I think the easiest thing for
me to make that's to like real food is
like eggs and totes like eggs with
spinach and toast and I actually got
that idea for Maggie cuz she always eats
that so I think I'm gonna go make that
right now because I have some time for
my class and you guys know I mean if you
watch my blogs so I normally work out in
the morning like I have to work out I
just have to work out or like freak out
I'm something that has way too much
energy so I need to like burn off that
energy by working out and I know
somedays I don't work out that I'm like
so shaky and jittery and I actually
can't sleep because I didn't work out
today like yesterday I didn't work out
and I'm gonna do is walking down the
street I was like you know I'm saying
when I woke up too late to work out this
morning so I think I'm just gonna make
myself will work out in the afternoon
which I don't really like and it just be
more proud and it's like wow
and another pro tip is if you guys do
like workout classes I've literally
always signed up for like seven I am
SoulCycle or 8 a.m. because then they
like make speak it up and even though I
mic have asleep like you know it's good
once you get there so anyway uh our
toaster is so dirty Wow I'm sorry this
is just what happens what I actually do
get enough sleep on the rare occasion I
have way too much energy
Wow it's beginning to rubra my aunt and
my friend's mom amazing funders so much
baby like who are we oh yeah okay let's
test it out mm-hmm cuz I never film in
class
I hate that label Thank You chin look
money that's better
we're just a finance class and I had a
really big realization I almost cried
during class because having less were
texting me
and being really inspirational before
but I realized like you just have to do
makes me happy and I think I'm gonna go
drop my tiny hands concentration
including this class today's the last
day to drop the DW all you do is make
ends ok Chen pretty challenging yeah a
girl who watched your videos wait that's
really fun okay you think I can go meet
with him invite you right now yeah just
walk it it's really funny she's she's
saying she's had a realization that's
when this is a huge conversation that
I'm trying to say yeah I'll see that
it's a huge conversation I've had with
her about being happy at the luxury
stuff
because Abby and I just talked about
that last week really but happy and I
think I'm nervous so guys I just left
the gym and I have to say I'm really
confused
I don't know if you can tell but it's
literally snowing out right now a little
just like welcome to treadmill now and I
missed Oh like sweaty it's like such a
good workout I'm eating some more my
legit favorite granola bar right now
it's so good I'm so tired walking uphill
on the treadmill I don't know why I just
haven't realized how great it is all
this long because there's like you're
lazy I like working out just don't
really like it this is so easy look it's
literally so easy I'm sweating through
my sweatshirt like look at this can you
see how sweaty the back of my sweatshirt
be I taught my aunt Kris about walking
uphill and treadmill we're in a rubra
and she was like so happy about it cuz
she was like when I run like you can't
my cart your knees and everything
whatever so walking uphill is the move
you can do it for so long you could
literally walk uphill like forever and
you're literally dripping in spice like
so I'm going to talk to you guys really
quick about this little bar please
there's no yeah there's some love this
black flavor flavor this black packaging
one is my favorite kind it's just so
look you can't tell me I'm wrong like
this is by far the best one actually I'd
be tied with a chocolate peanut butter
one because you guys know I love
chocolate peanut butter but this is the
three egg whites six almonds or cashews
two dates and no BS it's the chocolate
sea salt bomb so I love these little
bars for so long now they're so filling
I mean you obviously see them around or
had them or else you been living under a
rock and okay but what I love about them
so much is they're so filling there it's
like literally like eating three egg
whites six almonds four cashews
two dates and I love that because I feel
like so many granola bars protein bars
have like lists of long ingredients and
it's like why is that even necessary and
it turns out just those simple
ingredients taste so good anyway like
eating the real like whole foods are so
good so you don't need all the other
stuff that they add I know there's no
added sugar and I know our X bar has 11
different flavors which I really like
because I feel like I get sick of things
so quick like I'll eat the same thing
for like a bajillion days in a row and
then I like get sick of it so I just ate
it
million times row which like I don't
like you're supposed to that with food
I'm so high-maintenance but um here look
at your some other favorite oh this is
when I was telling about peanut butter
chocolate uh-huh so you can visit our
x-bar comm slash at Gretchen for twenty
five percent off your first order and
yeah just make sure you use Gretchen as
your little pro Bogota you'll get 25%
off you can try out your own rx bars I
just love them they're the best when I'm
like running to my ATMs and I don't have
time for breakfast and I'm literally
running down come out and I'm like
shoving one tooth on my throat or if I'm
like running to the gym after class but
I'm like hungry because like it's not
time for my next meal because that's
like later but it's like been 2 or 3
hours since I ate and I'm always have
reason that I even then you know I'm
saying so I just really recommend them
and now I gotta like shower and like get
my life together since Albany members
just join my sorority it's so fun we
have like so many events going on to
meet them and stuff so yeah I just feel
like I'm running around like a chicken
with my head cut off oh but I mentioned
it earlier that in my finance class that
I film for like one second it was my
last day because I realized in that
finance class that I didn't want to be
there anymore so I'm just like a really
quick word of advice is the best thing I
can say to you guys is like you gotta do
what makes you happy and that's
literally probably the best lesson I
learned in college so far like let me
just tell you I was actually texting
maybe Kendall Juliet you guys know that
I'm from Aruba during my class and I was
like guys I just wanna you know I know
you're all seniors in high school and
the best thing I can tell you is no
matter what anyone says no matter what
your parents want you to do your friends
what do you think society is like
pushing you to do if that be like a
lawyer or a doctor a certain degree
whatever it is like whatever it may be
like I don't care you gotta listen to
like your heart and like what you want
to do because this is always said but
it's so true if you can turn what makes
you happy into a job you're never gonna
work a day in your life and just like
strong word of advice matter what anyone
tells you you just gotta follow your
heart and don't be afraid to like mess
up or like change either like I change
my major I just dropped a concentration
like you can always change it's never
too late I'm giving them a pep talk
because I dropped my finance
concentration today when I dropped my
finance class so I'm gonna have like way
more free time to like do YouTube and
like sleep and like work out I forgot
about you guys for a sec I just showered
got ready put some dry shampoo at my
hair cuz I just did like washing it and
my foundation and I'm doing so I'm sorry
now what is this called
I want our concealer and as you can see
it's really lay on me but I just really
like light on does it turn into a
horrible college day in my life
I mean I guess is a pretty accurate
College in my life because every day my
life changes like today I just had my
one class which I'm dropping
Oh Natalie Putin is calling me and my
big we're gonna leave it like no
actually if we needed to be there 9:45
maybe we'll leave it like 9:30 so that's
pretty much it for a typical day in my
life at college some days are more
eventful than others maybe I'll do
another one of these where I think I'm
more busy because today I just wasn't
like right now I'm dressed up in like an
America theme because lunch with him
already event and I just literally got
ready for the past week three hours I
found like a little haul video that's
pretty typical of me on my typical day I
found lots of all I love clothes I love
shopping into the gym it snowed a little
you miss my nutritious dinner snap a
little crisps
I normally trail food I was just eating
a bunch of those rx bars because I'm
obsessed so that like wasn't that hungry
so then I just was eating these out of
them I mean I'm just really hard to
adult and like make real meals you know
what I'm saying so my name is ooh a
cereal for dinner or snappy crisps and
granola bars but yeah that's pretty much
it
College can be pretty chill sometimes
especially if you decide to drop a class
things so much for watching I'll see you
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
