right now and I'm up because I have to
go to an appointment I'm so tired
I literally said I'd like 3:00 a.m.
watching big little lies because I had

there was only one season now so I'm
like really sad because I wanted to keep
watching it but yeah I got a good about
my lashes filled how Inc they haven't
been filled in like two weeks so they
kind of you're trying to close bars

gonna burn my ball camera and then I was
like nah I'll forget to blog anyway so I
just left it in my room okay she did
such a good job I love you CAD they look
so much better but then I would I was
walking back in my FaceTime Lucy and I
always liked you better be up because
I'm coming to you and we're gonna get
who goes and we just got who goes this
is the best avocado toast of all time
and I remember this is like one of the
first ones I have and it's always been
in my head is like the best time I ever
had so I might try it again and let you
know it's still the best but probably it
is because I just remember it being so
yummy it was taking funny boomerang
I just got photo shoot of her and our
new Lulu outfit you're so cute and I
love them and her neuron huh from who
goes is so good
yeah we're just chilling it's a really
nice day out can someone tell me what
this is called is called Copley Place
it's like office buildings and stuff but
who goes it's like right over there by
the back bay like train station is that
a train station I don't even know I
don't really know what's over here we
just came over here cuz it's nice to eat
our little pasta he bowls so yeah oh
also this thing on the back of my phone
I think some people asked me I was just
from Arian his his phone phones down
eyes up and it's from my friend Carson
because she's like an area ambassador
here at BU so I just got it from her for
free but I actually I'm like didn't
really think about I didn't know what it
meant but then Hannah was like where'd
you get that I love it it's so cute
because it's like put your phone down
living the moment like eyes up like be
present so I actually think it's like
really cute at first I didn't know what
it was and I just wanted to put these
things because my old one broke and I
always need to have my cards back my
phone
I don't want to
oh yeah you can sit in my lap who's he
has to stand because she just got for
you a line yeah honestly he said on the
concrete they probably would get like
messed up
wait Lucy stand here cuz I want to show
them the color of them yeah and the
light was good right how cute are they
guys there was a new sport you too maybe
darker and I wanted them I liked them
better but yeah those are the one man he
just got I swear I was watching hundred
videos last night and she got the ones
they're a little bit darker and she did
like a little quick halt oh also I was
just texting her and we were texting
each other
it's for you there's no screenshots self
selfies of each other crying because I
just was feeling so deep like not last
night I wish I could tell everybody was
like 2:00 a.m. when I was catching up on
all our videos and I was reading
comments of people just being like I'm
so inspired by you Maggie like every day
I think of like what would Maggie do and
you made me more like productive and
efficient and just like like Maggie
lives I feel like very like simply I
don't explain it like we're both like
very extra like we like like extra
things sometimes but not like too crazy
and I feel like she just has like simple
like basic clothes like you know about
you guys know Maggie she's always
wearing like athleisure but she just
like it's like it's like a way of having
her life he's simple I don't know how to
explain it like I feel like she's always
like in order like everything's like
it's place like she always does her
stuff together and I'm trying to say
like her rooms clean she doesn't have
too much crap everywhere like I don't
know so I feel inspired by that because
I feel like someone that's always like
anxious and worried and has so much
going on and like clothes flowing and I
don't know if this is making any sense
but the over the place I'm all over the
place to have a gala though and yeah so
sorting these comments of people being
like I think every day like what would
now you do and you made me be like more
simple and efficient and like I don't
know and like I'm like wait that's
literally me like I think every day like
what were you doing this is so I love
you Maggie
what are you doing are you gonna sit on
the back okay so it doesn't mess up your
legging that's really funny
but then okay I'm just getting to I text
her sorry this is like really funny
right now I've been talking forever
about 19 I just love her she's one of my
best friend I told her I was like been
drawn to her videos last night and I was
like I've been taught so many of your
videos last night to catch up and I just
realized when I was reading the comments
and how they look up to you like what
like how much I look up to you and what
a positive impact you've made in my life
already tried that came out of nowhere
this would be paja but love me says it
she goes oMG sorry I look busted but I'm
crying you're cute how cute
but anyway I love her and all my friends
midnight that make me like a better
person and to me you know seriously you
like all the people I feel like I can
call me and say all the friends I have
in my life right now
make me like a better person and I think
that's how it should be and you should
I'm why am I being deep right now and
just basically well I'm very short
before we talk forever I just be
thankful for other people in your life
make you better first time like your
family and your friends
yeah okay heck so we're gonna eat our
food now finally because my goal is
definitely melted

vlogs whenever I look back and edit I'm
like I think arrangement eating I'm like
like gross so just know that like look
at that avocado day and if it shows like
somehow this plate over on the way home

Maggie's in there trying on clothes and

me up what a gem and establish that it
smells new here because it is new
we're in a mood right now we're on a
laughing mood we do people call you Mike
or just Michael your your what you're
like you're like Britney Spears and
Justin Timberlake to all denim outfit
and look at you go gather nothing they
look like really
they look good Mandy I like them they
look like your princess Polly ones I'm
not gonna lie they look no they look
good but they look just like the brink
that's probably what I think
borrowing ones hi Lizzie's helping me
move a bunch of stuff out now I have so
much stuff you guys saw me take out my
tapestry yesterday and I wrenched up I
packed up so we're gonna move a bunch of
stuff out it's not even really gonna be
like I'm moving out well although I
think I always do like moving and moving
out but I'm legit like staying I'm just
moving some stuff out I can go home for
the summer that I like won't meet you
know so kind of anti-climatic yeah I
miss Maggie and Kyle Michael I love them
Helen Michael are so fun and I love them
oh yeah I'll have they're shelling down
below like I said earlier but um look at
all the traffic dang
okay I'm not able to film like any of
this right now because we've no hands
and I have to carry these but XO ah at
the end of an era
Cabaye Lucy's apartment you were really
cute we had so many memories here like
last night what about Cheyenne man this
is sad I will not miss this lamp and me
always hitting my head against it by
accident and I will miss the good
lighting this is where oh the other day
I remember this is deja vu I was right
here and I mean now I'm gonna make up on
and actually funny because in the blog
the other day I had no makeup on and
everyone was like or there was a couple
comments that were like your skin looks
so good and I thought I was gonna cry
how many people were saying that my skin
was like glowing because you guys know
or if you know me from like a wild all
right used to struggle with acne so bad
like I literally tried every single
thing you can think of except for a few
teams
I wanted to enact but I never did
because I knew someone evil that had
like really brittle bones or like had to
gothic because it was hurting my liver
or whatever so I never did that but I
think I did everything else and now I
actually just got a couple pimples like
yesterday but I don't know it's just
like usually a night like that some of
you were saying I had such good skin
because I struggle with it for so long
so now for people to be like you have
good skin and be like I like you like
you I'm like white like I never thought
people would look up to me for my skin
because I always actually other become
big on water skin so basically I think
the best advice I can get
is I think what I've learned the most is
like so random I just was thinking of it
cuz I was in this spot the other day
with Laura saying my skin was good but
on my best advice is less is more
because I remember I'd wear so much
makeup and I would do so much my skin
I'd like exfoliate and cleanse and tone
in prime and lotion and moisturize and
cream this and spritz that I don't know
I did everything on medicine I did so
much but literally like Mandy like the
people that I know that the best skin
Mandy's always had perfect skin you won
what she does she takes off her makeup
with a makeup line like every night
that's it that's literally all she does
and she'll watch it like once in a while
in the shower she remembers like I just
like less is more so yeah sure I
pineapple that was just a fun little
surprise I just got so happy that you
said that true is like a I've been
craving it and it's cold and it's caught
up and it's cold and juicy oh so good
pineapple or I mean fresh fruit and this
apartment is like a rarity Lucy never
gets fruit because the other day she
goes for it's expensive and it goes bad
really quick like I get it I honestly
don't get through as much as I would
like you know when we were home at high
school and stuff we'd always get fruit
cuz we would just take mom dad get fruit
but then I think when it's yourself it's
like harder I don't know why but Taylor
gets so much poop where daddy's been
waiting so long but we had to pack up so
much stuff uhm yeah peace out junior
year oh my god blue I think I'm a junior
in high school I'm getting sentimental
but also I'm gonna talking about it
today when I met Kyle and Michael I was
so happy they're like the funnest people
and if you're watching is kind of
Michael I love you
and we're ready best friend the vacuum
got it
who's he you'd need to me cry on my
phone you will love them um nice in fun
I'm happy it was such a nice day I met a
bunch of subscribers to you what it was
so fun I love you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
