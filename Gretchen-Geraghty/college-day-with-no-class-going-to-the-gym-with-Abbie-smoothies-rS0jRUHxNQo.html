right now and I'm just feeling so like
worn down I feel like I've been pushing
myself a lot and not sleeping that much
and today I'm gonna have class it's
Tuesday so I plan on like having rest
and relaxation all day and really just
trying to like heal myself drink a lot
of water I'm making tea right now and
heating up the microwave so yeah
okay let's try it oh it's good this will
thank me oh this just tastes like I
think I never had like normally Lipton
tea but it just tastes like normal tea
and I just imported a bunch of footage
to edit and yeah just one of those days
oh I also have to bring you guys to Best
Buy because I need to get you fixed
little camera I don't know if they're
gonna fix it and clean it out or just
give me a new one but this time I have
insurance I think okay guys now I'm
gonna do some dishes yeah I might try to
make my roommates like me see I'm
getting sick um but yeah basically I
don't do that many dishes
I don't do as many as I should so I try
to make my roommates happy
wait can I just say something really
like peanut butter on things is so hard
to get off you like scrape it off with
your fingers and wash it off huh okay
that's all resume montage of me cleaning
dishes I'm going to try to drink a lot
of water today too because obviously
it's just like really good for you and I
think I've been bad at it recently just
like when I get really busy and the
other day when I saw Maggie literally it
was when we were taking like our prom
pictures if you guys remember at the
Fairmont Hotel her skin was like glowing
and she just looked so good and I'm like
why do you look different like you look
so pretty right now good
and she's like literally I've been
drinking like an insane amount of water
so anyway I just know that water helps
everything so when I try to drink as
much as I can yesterday I hit my goal
and finished three of these and that's
like three liters which is so crazy to
think about like you can drink 3 liters
of water in a day like that is like a
lot of water you know like I remember
when I climbed Mount Kilimanjaro we had
to drink they would make us drink at
least 3 now jeans a day and if not more
because that was like the best way to
knock it off shoot sickness but anyway
so that's just why I try to drink three
day because then I feel like you're like
super hydrated cuz I think like at least
two is probably recommended but I may
drink three you're probably really good
Owen do you guys brush your teeth but
this is really written you brush your
teeth before really breakfast or after
you breakfast because oh I didn't even
show I just ate toast and eggs it's like
normal for me and my tea first and toast
and eggs
um but yeah do you brush your teeth
before after because I still have not
brushed my teeth and I'm like ooh I kind
of just depends on the day for me I feel
like I do both but now I'm gonna be a
brush in my teeth
I think it's so funny showing you guys
brush my teeth I don't know why there's
something very like real about brushing
your teeth you know I just put you on my
face moisturizer contain
way down there look I feel like brushing
your teeth is just something that
everyone does so it's just so normal and
universal you know ah much better
why am I like this okay you just did
that on purpose can we just shut up
because I just hurt you
I literally just ran into the wall with
it and I wonder why I keep having to get
new cameras huh Oh what I was saying now
is I'm really excited to show you
something
that Maggie like kind of talk to me
about lol my memory card was full okay
we're back in business
basically I want to talk to you guys
about is vitamins so I haven't been
taking like vitamin supplements
regularly at all in the past couple of
months but I actually have taken them
before I remember when I chopped up all
my hair remember guys when I got like 13
inches off my junior year of high school
lol how spontaneous and just irrational
of me but anyway I started taking biotin
after that because people told me that
it made your hair grow so I was like I
really want that so I took that for a
little while and then you guys know I
was vegan for was it like almost a year
over a year something like that it was
freshman year of college too sophomore
year of college um I was vegan and so I
was taking vitamin b12 because our
nutritionist sent a stroke for the
lightweight team our nutritionist just
told me that really the only thing
you're gonna be missing if you're vegan
is b12 so I took b12 then and then I'm
trying to think I've taken any other
supplements or anything like that
obviously like vitamin C just stuff like
that but basically I've been feeling
this is so weird I don't know if you
guys feel like this but in the past
couple months or so I've been feeling
like anxious and like overwhelmed about
like vitamins which I know sounds so
weird but like I really will go to the
vitamin Island I saw Maggie talks about
this in her video because I was just
watching it that she feels like really
overwhelmed when she's like in the
vitamin aisle as well and she just like
looks at everything and there's like I
don't know what to do and she was saying
that Kaylee
how's it together and like knows what to
get and I feel like that's Lucy like
Lucy has all of her vitamins and she
knows but I'm like super like curious
about vitamins but I like don't know
that much about them and don't know like
which ones I should be taking her I just
know like what I want from them like I
want like more energy I want like
vitamins that promote like clear skin
and being like hydrated and what I was
going to say since I was vegan before I
was vegan I don't think I was ever like
lactose intolerant at all or had like
digestive issues at all but I feel like
since I stopped being vegan right as I
started eating like meat and dairy again
my stomach would hurt so bad and now I
like still don't eat meat and dairy that
much just because of the way it makes
mice time I feel and it like hurts and
oh yeah so basically now I feel like
sometimes I do have like digestion
problems so if I had like vitamins that
could help me with that like I know Lucy
will take probiotics I think that's what
they're called like if I had like
probiotics or like someone like that
that would be like super helpful so
basically I'm like curious I know like a
little bit about vitamins but not all
that much and now he was telling me
about Kara because she actually saw it
on like this Co and it's so cute it
comes in these little packages it's like
these vitamins made just for you it's
like super personalized and it'll say
like hi Maggie hi Gretchen
and so I'm like super excited to try it
out and I think it's so cool and I'm
like super excited to try it out and
it's like you guys are like trying it
out with me and you can like see my
result so I'm just gonna show you the
five minute quiz that they have right
now on and it basically just has you go
through and I like took it before cuz I
already like ordered my vitamins but I
will show you like what I did when I
went through it but you don't have to
know the venom itself you just have to
know what you want on it okay so this is
what it looks like when you're going to
start taking your quiz hey it's so cute
curious for sure okay less than five
minutes I like that so it's like split
up into these like four little sections
I've actually didn't take it all the way
through again because I want to see if I
get the same thing as I got when I first
ordered that if you're taking vitamins
or supplements in the past on off for
sure do you currently take any vitamins
or supplements No
so I just finished my quiz so these were
the six that were recommended to me by
karat up and I'm super excited to try
them all out just based on like what I
was saying was important to me
I just enzymes I don't really know what
that is magnesium I know my sister used
to take I'm not really sure what it does
though see but like I know that this is
gonna be what I wanted to do since they
recommend it for me you know I mean
vitamin D isn't that like the Sun I
think probiotics I don't know what that
is vitamin E someone told me that's good
but yeah so those are the vitamins I'm
getting I am so so excited to try them
out and just see like the differences
and how I'm feeling or how my skin is
looking or you know what I mean and
literally I'm someone you guys know I'm
sick all the time I like try to take it
care of myself as best I can but
honestly I know I don't sleep enough for
how much I'm like active like working
out and just like traveling and like
running around all over the place like
I'm always very busy and I can wake up
and like sometimes you'll just be able
to see like my lymph nodes will
literally be like baseballs and just
like so swollen and I'm like why do you
do this to yourself Gretchen you're
running yourself to the ground you're
always L so basically I'm really excited
to try out these little vitamins because
I feel like obviously they're gonna help
me a weight on the page with my six
vitamins it shows me like probiotic
blend it like says what it does on the
quiz so if I just read then I would know
for my digestion you told us that your
stomach concerns and s tax and then he
talked about your skin a concern its
parts your skin health
oh I like this so I'm so excited to try
it out I can't wait to update you guys
and yeah that's pretty much it so now
I'm stressed
oops ed I know wouldn't but myself
because I just called Best Buy
and I mean I figured this would be the
case but I like to talk to the Geek
Squad I do have insurance on this but I
knew that they would have to send it in
and he was like yeah we can kind of try
to see if we can clean it a little bit
in stores but we don't really work with
the cameras we like send them in and
then can and will get back to us and be
like oh we can fix it and send it back
or like we can't fix it and they'll just
give me anyone but
he's like yeah the whole process takes
about ten business days but I literally
film with this little guy every day so I
don't know what to do because I want to
be able to vlog and next week Thursday I
go to Coachella so like if I don't have
it back for then like Coachella blogs
are like the funnest vlogs like I need
again and like clearly this is working
pretty well but when it starts turning
on and off obviously it's really
frustrating
um but boy oh boy I don't know what to
do but I'm gonna stop complaining
because literally it's no one else's
fault but my own so taking full
responsibility here I'm just gonna throw
in some clothes um I'm still like a
fluffy fluff all but that's okay because
you know this was supposed to be like my
relaxing chill day and now I'm like
trying to do all these things I have to
do but like sometimes you just have to
be an adult like whatever um because
I've been meaning to get this fixed so I
just gotta go it's like a little after
one now and I made my appointment for
two so I gotta go do that I'll bring you
guys long wait I'm back what I was gonna
say is I'm gonna show you since I'm like
not gonna shower or anything cuz I'm
just gonna workout later and I shall
read yesterday don't worry I already has
today for the gym so I'm still gonna be
showering every day I'm not gonna like
the skipper - are let's say oh I'm down
again to show you I want to show you
what I'm gonna do for my skin because um
and the morning I don't wash it I think
I've rinsed all this money memo just
like rinse it off with some water um
sometimes I watch in the morning kind of
depends but it's money you just rinse it
off some water and I've been using this
ultra or prepare cream moisturizer ever
to use so much of it can you tell you
can't it literally just looks wait well
it's like half gone um I can just tell
you and it kind of reminds me of just
like the set of fail little pot
moisturizer haha
called get digger out a little but like
you know the one that you go like this
i'ma fingers did a little dippy I don't
think any sense
but yeah we're just been using this so I
wanted to show you cuz I feel like this
is a vein of health and relaxation skin
care is important boys okay so I do that
well I thought my family ties are really
intensely because my skin just got so
red I was like
but um okay that and then you know you
only do this at night but I got this eye
cream I showed you guys actually by just
showing it in alcohol video um it's this
visit Bobby Brown
yeah Bobby Brown like hydrating I could
oh wait that's literally what it's
called I dream that look at me go and I
just take a little bit of that no why is
this finger because people I think
you're supposed to go like that and then
I just rub that all in I guess I'm gonna
do it going today
I don't think you're supposed to put it
on like your top eyelid but I always
kind of do that cuz like I don't I don't
know I just do what I do um and what
else
okay I'm gonna not gonna put any makeup
actually I should i I don't think I'm
gonna but Maggie made me love this fresh
rose floral so I'm gonna raise my I've
got so much better than the market ask
you one cuz you're just be like a fresh
glowing Rose should I come like maybe
I'll just put on eyebrows and I don't
have eyelash extensions anymore as you
can tell like these babies are so short
focus you can see yes yeah baby they are
that's just like naturally how short my
eyelashes are though like they're very
short so that's why I get extensions a
lot and I actually think I'm gonna get
them on Thursday Shay's Tuesday so might
go get them again I think I'm gonna
because I really missed them and if you
like find extensions right now I just
put on my eyebrows maybe some bronzer
and be done I don't know
decisions they overwhelm me maybe I'll
just do some eyebrow powder so I might
have to use pencils like light and now
I'm gonna do some bronze air I love this
brother this was like my day when
bronzer and then I used hula for a while
I know I'm back to this
sir this is the Too Faced chocolate
Soleil one and my favorite thing about
it though is masa and this one's new
because I just now finished my container
before and I literally had it since
seventh grade
I'm not even kidding you like that's
probably bad that I use it for so long
and you was so like old but that's just
how much I loved it and how long it
lasts like I love how long it lasts so
yeah oh and also I think I should miss
me video but my new favorite thing is
taking like this like eyeshadow brush
and going like that and I just feel like
it makes your nose skinnier come on
doing my nose like a look at that I mean
when you wear like more makeup it looks
more like normal and stuff oh and then I
just take it and I go like that I'm
gonna make up like once you start you
can't stop like I could just keep going
and going but we're going for natural
look yeah no I'm using my own ease my
eyebrow powder whatever I'm gonna use an
eyebrow pencil look at how baby this is
now like there's none left
it's the honest Asha one why am i
showing you everything to say I'm just
gonna show you everything today in the
way I mean except for today I don't have
class but I mean that's like a lot of
days I don't have class and they just
have class and they went okay and then
the other days it's like on me to be you
know responsible and get stuff done even
today I wanted to leave it on a but I
have it so okay oh you done I always
have to curl these because they're so
how I've been filming a lot okay I made
you my mascara off camera so that you
don't have to sit through this anymore
kboys here we go hi guys so I know the
last thing I showed you it was Best Buy
but I actually had to send in my camera
I was so stressed yeah it was very
crying oh so he just got to Lucy's and
luckily she's letting me use her camera
for the next literally couple hours
because tomorrow morning Amazon is
delivering a new camera that I got from
Amazon so that I can use that for the
next like month while they're fixing my
camera and then I'm gonna return it when
I get my camera at that make sense
because when you get your camera fixed
you have to send it in to Canon and then
they fix it and send it back and also
they can't fix it there just want to get
a new one but I'm getting like a like a
temporary camera tomorrow from Amazon

Amazon library yeah cuz I'm in I'm gonna
return it oh you can yeah I have their

Tana but you guys notice but like the
days I didn't vlog I was like sad and I
feel like I wasn't doing stuff and like
vlogging makes me do fun things so I'm
just gonna be like it every day's gonna
be fun

like whoo are you vlogging today please
