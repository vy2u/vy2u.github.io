and I'm so
so I'm back and I feel like I don't know
sweaty well I was like really sweaty in
today's class and I started to think
maybe it was like residually that's not
the right word maybe it was just like
left over from a hot yoga last face and
so I was like obviously dripping I was
like maybe I was like so sweaty because
of that I don't know if that makes any
sense
but I'm just like exhausted because I
wouldn't you got like 7:00 p.m. last
night and the night's also at 7 a.m.
today so it's just like very quick and I
got a pimple my chin yawns from oh but I
wanted to show you guys
oh wait whoa wait first before I show
you that um Maddie was really awesome as
usual and I know she's like struggling
with her back injury and I talked about
that and like a recent vlog but she my
neck she actually got on the bike today
um and was like on the bike first one
the class so I know she's like getting
back into it and I think Wednesday
Maggie and me are gonna go to her at
6:30 class and Beacon Hill together if
you guys are gonna be there because we
are flying out to Coachella
Thursday morning really early so that
Keys just gonna stay here boss with me
but anyway what I wanted to show you is
I don't think I showed these in a vlog
yet oh yeah I did it because I got them
on Saturday and addy still had like my
blog camera but like how sick are these
and obsess I don't know if you guys saw
my big and natalie has them and I just
straight-up copied her because I thought
they were so cool like they're so just
like I don't know not something I
normally wear but I was like these were
like pushed me out of my comfort zone
and she was wearing them and I was like
those are literally just just sick as
sneakers I've ever seen
so I'm so excited to wear these popping
around dang yeah I really wanted eggs
and toast but if you guys remember from
last night are like for hitch this is
not afraid our stove we like pulled out
all the way and Taylor had it's like
unplugging it
yeah except lunch because this burner
something is wrong with it and you can
kind of tell to see how it's all like
black and then these ones are more like
silver to our stove is literally okay oh
but you know we're college kids okay but
this was on even though all the burners
were like off this was on so we got
really scared span unplugged it but now
I really want eggs
so should I like climb back there so I
can plug it in make eggs and then maybe
I'll unplug it again and jailer made
popcorn here I'll just wait I have a
dilemma because I really want eggs so I
think I'm gonna pull out the stove and
plug it in again I think that's okay
because I'm an alcohol maintenance
afterwards to tell them to come and look
at it yeah don't use the scary burner so
I just pulled out the stove to plug into
the thing and then I turned on the front
burner I don't you can tell it's smoking
do you see that it's like smoking oh
there it is yeah so I'm kind of scared
so I just turned it off now which one is
this one okay so I did it I really feel
like Maggie she's the one that made me
like toast and eggs with like spinach
and stuff in the money guy actually more
than just by nature but spring mix I was
steady at the grocery forever looking at
all the lettuces being like likes
overwhelmed and a guy came over and he
was like always go for the spring mix
it's like the mix is the best I was like
okay let's do it and I had to pour
myself a little glass of water cuz

beretta and I left my hydro flask oh oh
I'm sad but hopefully they find it yeah
