under the weather
yeah I'm just wearing my body out in
college but you know we're young it's
okay Hannah was dusting this would give
me a lunch fun
but anyway I'm off to class and then
right after cost well I guess between
classes because I have cost twelve fifty
to two and then 6:15 to 9:30 but Arlen
and I are actually gonna go the
Prudential Center which isn't really fun
and he said yes like exchange his Canada
goose cuz he got to pick Emma size or
something and maybe I can like shopping
to Sephora and buy stuff
I lost my eyebrow pencil which is really
sad so I pulled in my eyebrows with
eyeshadow and I think they just look
like crazy so I'm gonna try to get like
maybe on Asajj your brow bone or
something whatever anyway let's go to
consumer behavior marketing Wow it's
actually quite interesting I really
enjoyed my classes semester it's way
better than coral Asmus so guys I have
the new sweet green special here we've
got hard-boiled egg chicken chick peas
kale I don't know what to do I just like
I picked out everything that I like
individually yeah not really considering
what would happen if they went together
but it's actually good so that's why I'm
gonna call it the Arland special yeah so
I've been bad at vlogging what's new I'm
pretty sure I blogged for like one
second with Arlen sweet green but we
just had a little date and then we went
over to the Prudential shopped around a
little bit took some pictures of course
I didn't walk any of that I just it's
just hard when I'm like in the moment or
like in a conversation with someone the
last thing I think is like oh I have to
like build this you know what I mean
whatever you guys get it and then I was
just downstairs and Abbey's room for a
bit a P and a D two roommates by the way
which is funny because her names are a
via Nattie and everyone says a be a D
like they call each other and then they
think the other person's name cuz
they're similar
anyway everyone's going it to be Mahad
tonight and I'm so sad I'm so sad I
can't go

place for the women's soccer team like
American soccer team yeah me and I are
sitting in the bottom cushion and it's
like way too early to be like a wake
9:15
you you'll tan I meant to tell you you
just like Centanni okay we're looking to
go and before I could do it is noon and
it's three
when he fixed my soul at 4:30 but it's
like literally across the street so I
mean it just doesn't work for that I've
been so studious a guy's you'd be so
proud of me because I feel like I'm
always just like doing sober youtuber
with my friends and just kind of
neglecting school but this morning I
thought I was 9 a.m. in room 9 since
12:30 I wrote a fantastic book and I
caught up because I was so alive I treat
a bunch of chapters I thought up
something like going and read for my
marketing class look at me it's like
pretty chilly out but I walked here from
classroom so I also feel productive
because of that nice new bird vlogging
in public I could do it it's so nice
that sweet green so close to Seoul
because I'll either go like right before
school class or like right after is even
better
you're like hungry and sweaty and tired
and it's just like literally all you do
like see greens right back there and
then Boston back they SoulCycle is like
right across
Copley Square right there whoa and here
we are so I just left Seoul of course it
started out now my hair is dripping wet
cuz I showered it was so good I love
James out look at guys you mean till I
got back from the grocery and they got
all of Trader Joe's how was it guys - Oh
Taylor did cor for 80 minutes straight
so that was her day wait Taylor did I
ever study that comment I think I did
and they were saying like Taylor how's
your morning and you're like season well
for me an alien invasion cured cancer
ran 20 miles did all my homework bolded
laundry vacuum did Gretchen's dishes and
and it's about it's about noon it was
really funny Meghan had a really busy
day in core if anyone remembers quiet
korloff semester so pray for Meghan
because it's really rough
is a little bit after seven right now
might sound like sick it's like always
fun in the morning anyway
and right now I'm just waiting it for my
naked Navi to pick me up

want to show you guys I made overnight
oats and I actually doubled it because
usually I just do like half a cup of
oats 1/2 cup of almond milk is - my
dutiful cup oats whole cup almond milk

short questions they're like the myelin
sheath is what do I even say that right
something like that you know I mean so
it was a really tough exam hi
it was really tough
yeah like well we didn't really go to
any so that was the issue but me now
we're like okay and like the worst grade
out of all of them out of the four gets
dropped so we're like okay so this can
be our one bad one and then we'll after
you got on the other ones and actually
you're exactly right we can only go up
from here right
hi Mandy I'm vlogging hey guys urban
right now I mean they just moved on
FaceTime Mandy
I just tried to a couple things I tried
on these overalls but we were like you
know Gretchen you don't need overalls
and swampers really cute but it's just
so casual like I don't know how to wear
it
because it looks more fancy but then
like the materials really soft and
stretchy and then I always see these
jeans because I saw them from her so I
have to get them for her they're the
twig black high-rise Eugene with rips in
the knees and I just had to search with
a guy forever to find ones with the rips
yeah I saw them from Lucy cuz I realized
him so now I'm gonna memory ones
it's so pretty out even though it's like
literally freezing cold I'm so cold
running across the street just full
cycle right now because it is 4/20 and I
gotta get my bike set up and everything
and I feel really done walking in there
with a bunch of shopping bags but what
else was a girl to do when you're
walking out Newbery on your ad copy
square if you walk by Brandi and I'll
have an urban so I had to do what I had
to do but I'm literally running because
like from the Public Library / - so like
it's just right over there so it's like
a two minute walk guys I can see I've
been literally the best mood before
during and after so like I don't know
what it is I'm just like way happy like
way more happy than I should be because
it's just like such a fun time like I
literally am like smiling ear to ear the
entire classes oh thank you camera oh my
gosh I just got a new phone case in my
phone it's a guitar D Funky's my guns
actually charging right now um but it
fell in the front and I thought my spear
was gonna crack I don't have my legs
with one anymore but I didn't think in
it so the reason I flipped out right now
is about Lucy's apartment - Conda and I
call her the urban outfitter scenes that
I stole from her so she keeps being the
Christian I need them like get me a new
pair or give them back but I just really
like her so I got a new pair but when I
went to the urban it's like high-waisted
black ripped jeans on the knees put the
non ribbed ones and the red ones are all
mixed together and the guy ever stood on
me mind decides 24 and I'm like well I'm
not 24 I'm like we needed 26 or 27 and
so he found them I told was pathetic did
it and she was up fat cuz I want to
surprise married like a few folks I did
I'm gonna bring her now so I can go
I keep that noise look who it is
hi I went on a spree I went on a literal
spree well if you really want to know
what happened oh my gosh I can't breathe
I was walking from questrom to the
library copley librarian with the book
you want but it's like not walking from
question is not far at all and it's like
because like if you walk like a half
mile from question me right the
beginning of Newberry street and then
majorly close so I was walking my new
beer and I was on FaceTime with Mandy
