right now and I tried to get it I like
it 7:15 to go to the gym but you know I
just feel like yeah I just needed some
extra sleep on this Monday morning I'm
trying to shake like whatever cold I
have so I was like you know what I'm
gonna sleep I'm gonna slip in a little
bit more get some breakfast and go to
the gym later so yeah I'm gonna make
some breakfast right now and then head
to the gym because I have closet 1250 so
I still have some time to worry I'm
gonna take my vitamins you guys know
I've been taking these and hopefully
they're curing me like please fix me
care of today's go if opportunity
doesn't knock bill the door I love it
like how I've been feeling who's trying
to take advantage of my opportunities in
life you know camera stop being deep
people said they were laughing when I
was swallowing vitamins before they're
like damn you just downed like seven
might have been so quick and take me
like forever to swallow like one I can
only just slurp them down it's your joke
it's okay you're never appropriate oh
girl
how was your gym says you did oh well
because I missed every other day weight
dealer we do this show you things in the
vlog too if you guys don't follow me on
snapchat or like add me on snapchat
whatever add me
I usually I'm scratch him to five ends
because you'll see Taylor roasting my
life half the time no it was like a huge
roast set last night but it was really
funny I just think it's funny and Taylor
way just saying what you just said you
guys can get a taste of hey but I deal
use it oh should I wake you up this
morning and you were like no I wake up
in touch
let her sleep for another half-hour
proceeds to so Matt wake up and eyes
looking on to her - really podcasters
going in Newberry I think she deserves
to sleep in for her big day of nothing I
want to be really really she's like what
the media today
oh nothing again great oh don't wait
overheads for yourself you just stay in
bed and then I texted you probably back
in 45 I actually was up at like 7:05 and
then I was like if we go at 7:30 I have
25 minutes of sleep and then I set my
alarm for 7:30 I woke up and I was like
I'm just still tired
actually no but to me that's not you
Taylor honey okay I do a cute little
montage this time but I just did all the
dishes so really proud of yourself okay
and then we never do the dishes usually
leave the pile of dishes but I did
okay so I feel well-being so I'm like
running through the Prudential Center
Arena how was it like 5:30 and you're
probably like what's going on or a
sprinter Center and I also have class in
a network but I saw in the question of
library it for literally three and a
half hours
oh my god music said I'm very sorry but
it's out there for three and a half
hours making a presentation as I'm
presenting today at 6:30 so I didn't eat
so I'm starving so I came here to use be
agreement obviously Heather didn't come
here everyday so bad and I also have to
stop by Sephora cuz my grandma gave me a
gift card for my birthday so I'm gonna
spend that I'm missin bogging how cuz is
like really hard for me oh yeah
I was in legit starving cities like
like Max Arthur's dressing my face this
is the guacamole greens and it's so good
and my little against this Julia except
for she gets it
what's it
cuz of chicken and I did that last time
and I feel like that's what I would lose
you because I like it better it's so
good
and I got chicken but yeah I would make
money now we're like sweet potato and
Apple and most ha making stuff or I get
like the other ones but this one to me
tastes are different just like oh I was
there for legit like 20 minutes I just
had to I didn't get out really quick
take some lotion and an eyeshadow primer
I got a new primer because y'all roasted
me so bad and I like really ancient one
from Urban Decay I got a nice one
because I think I've heard that people
say that one's good too
okay so this weird thing has happened
where I've actually told you guys that I
only have class like Monday Wednesday
and I like barely have any class because
I would drop by an anthem or whatever um
but since I'm only taking three classes
this semester since I dropped my finance
class I have to take for each semester
like senior here to me try graduate and
time which is like fine by me because I
was like I'm not doing spine class but
I'm actually taking a psych class that's
supposed to have lectures she goes to a
Thursday morning but I never have it so
that's why I just told you as I have
class Monday Wednesday because it is
like a rare week where I actually have
those classes like I think they normally
are just cancelled whatever so then our
final exam is next week May 1st so then
I was ago obviously we have class both
days this week and then I just checked
online and I like got up and brush my
teeth and I'm not really ready but I
started like getting my life together
and I was kind of excited to go to get
my day started and I just checked the
syllabus and we were never supposed to
have costed April 24th so yeah it like
this is exactly why I didn't tell you I
have class now because it never meets it
doesn't ever meet and because normally
our professor will just like read this
slide
and he's like he posts him on the
website so then he's like if you're sick
or like miss a class I don't take
attendance and like it doesn't matter
that much because I can read the slides
online that's all you have to do and
yeah a lot of times we'll just cancel
class and be like oh just read the
slides online so that that's exactly why
I didn't tell you every Tuesday Thursday
but like none of my other classes are
like that just that's why I think it's
just like it's like an intro psych class
it's really like all freshmen like me
because I I've never taken psych and I
wanted to do it so now I'm like what do
I do
all this time I slept really gently
probably four hours last name which is
just completely my fault what was I
doing
to like 2:00 or 3:00 a.m. but um yeah
I'm really excited because I made over a
night out so maybe I'll just go eat
though oh wait this is good that I'm up
early because I literally have 8,000
million things to do today even though
it's Tuesday and I like don't up class
all day um at 7:30 p.m. I SoulCycle with
addy so we're gonna do that and
obviously we're going with Madi love you
girl oh and also like for Coachella um
when we when like the day before we left
I mean mad Maggie I always mix up 30
days me and Maggie went to Maddie's
class that night and I remember like I
don't know if you guys remember but I
was like walking home from class and I'm
like oh yeah I got to go back and I'm
gonna pack what you guys packing and
then I'm gonna go to suppose I go with
Maggie tonight she's gonna be coming
here and like we're gonna get sweet
cleans up and then I like leave good
morning and then the next clip was like
the next morning like 5:00 a.m. us
leaving and I was like wait where did
all the footage go like when I was like
editing it and I formatted my memory
card like the idiot I am before I
imported that like last band of that day
footage so I'm so sad because I like
blogged with matías whole cycle any of
you saw like Maggie's wall gets probably
there cuz we were like both vlogging
with her but I was so excited because I
always talked about Maddy and then it
was like the end of the class and we
were like blogging and I was like oh get
over you're like be in the vlog
I reckon deleted it so I was like beyond
upset because I know it seems trivial
but just because I like oh we talked
about her and she wasn't me in the blog
oh what I was going to say is it's good
that I'm up early because I like a
benign thanks to I have to like ship a
package I have to get my nails done
these are driving me insane I have yes
oh oh and I need to go to our school
communications because I'm trying to
take the design class next Oh
oh my gosh my brain is working so slowly
right now well Arlo is telling me to
take it because he says it's like so
helpful and interesting and like if it
can help me with like YouTube stuff
because we learned in design that's what
it's called an Adobe I don't really know
good ever tinea and they're like
Photoshop and that would be like so good
for me to know because I I've never been
I've never like learned about
photography editing any like software
anything like that and I think a lot of
people have and I just like taught it
all to myself and try to figure it out
anyway anyway I'm gonna show that
because I'm boring and I just you know
it's get our day started house I've been
really horrible at vlogging I really
brought my vlog camera and didn't even
vlog but um I went to our school
communications talked to a person for a
bit and they just told me I had to wait
to register for this class I whined
until it opens up for non comm students
because I'm a question student and then
I hung out with Abbi and I was searching
in her room for a dress and I lost a
Baryonyx Ariana I know you're gonna
watch Justin I love you and it's
actually gonna be funny when we look
back at it because I'm gonna find it
tonight I borrowed her a black romper
for our last date party and then I'm
ruined dress I was gonna wear the Murray
dress but then I switched into the black
romper
and then the maroon dress she wants back
and I left it in a B Emily's his room
but like eight people are there and so
it's just like floating around somewhere
his way of dividing it I feel so bad
because I like never do this with people
stuff I'm always like so good with it

clothes are but I'm gonna find them so
not to worry
and I'm it is like a living something
