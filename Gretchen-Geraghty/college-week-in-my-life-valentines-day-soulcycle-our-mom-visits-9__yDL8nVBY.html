a.m. and I'm walking back from his
apartment and back to my apartment I'm
so tired
we went way too late I was like Lou
promised when I come over we'll just eat
generally go to bed early think I'm so
tired and obviously we went to bed so
late so yeah I'm just walking back to my
apartment so early because if SoulCycle
at 8:30 so I gotta go back change my
life together and our mom's coming today
for the day and I'm so excited because
I'm just really excited to hear and hang
out in probably go to lunch I think
we're gonna go to the Museum of Fine
Arts so that'll be fun she's got already
and I have to do laundry some I like
Alfie does not match at all whatsoever
but that's okay and I'm eating a banana
because if you guys remember this summer
I passed out and fall because I just
didn't eat forever I gotta make sure I
always eat before is one that I always
just see like a banana oh man woman oh
look happy he's actually my I got back

times if she's trying to go to bed she I
can't sleep social just like come sleep
with me or if I'm not here so I'll just
sleep in my bed oh but I wanted to talk
to you guys about this energy drink I'm
gonna try out right now I haven't really
been once like drink energy drinks
because I'm like scared of what they
like do to me cuz like a lot of times
they have like so many ingredients but
this one's called for purpose energy and
what I really like about it is that it's
an organic energy drink and like into
socially responsible companies just
because I've learned so much about them
in business school and it says at ten
cents for a better tomorrow and so every
can donate ten cents to education for
children in developing countries so I
think that's really awesome and the
ingredients list as you can see it was
like really short and it just says stuff
like carbonated water organic cane sugar
natural flavors lemon juice caffeine you
know I don't drink coffee because I
don't like the taste of it it kind of
just drink water but I literally cannot
keep my eyes open
I'm gonna try this out and I know it's
Rhys berry pomegranate that's what the
can says oh it smells good
