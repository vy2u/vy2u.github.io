like my sororities philanthropy little
event tomorrow so that's can be really
fun and I'm going to yoga with Abby in
like 45 minutes and actually before yoga
we're gonna stop by an apartment nearby

maybe I can like film there unless the
girl would think it's really weird if I
like without my camera but I could show
