doesn't it look so good obviously I went
to my bill Kyle I'll add a coat so on
and coat a I've even say it like either
buy like a legit it looks so freakin
good thank God I got inverts anymore I'm
like sober they told me so many of you
guys went because of me like so many
people are like oh so like you know
Gretchen and I'm just so happy that you
guys go because he's literally like my
favorite person that's ever done my hair
like he just has such a good job are you
so funny nice to talk to you so like
literally go to Kyle he's that Kyle when
I'm not to say his last name it's like
sorts of dizzy I'm not anybody trying to
like butchered last name I'm gonna
scream um but I'm in a happy mood cuz my
hair looks really good I am a formal
tonight and I think I might just leave
it straight like he just like blew it
out straight or I might like curl it
later I don't really know but I kind of
like it this way like do you think it's
good because I like it this way
was he supposed to go meet me and who
goes to right now but she's like asleep
so I don't want to do it's like 11:45 I
just wanted to do something by myself
because I'm hungry but
yeah so I just got back from Louise's
room I wish I filmed with her but we
just hung out and we have a formal
tonight so I was just like trying on
dresses and I ordered a bunch from
revolve like two days ago and luckily
they came in time revolve always has my
back like I just feel like like if you
need a dress for something they always
have to date shipping that's like free
so it's so nice wow I am obsessed with
the way my hair came out look at it it
looks so much better so good oh yeah and
I'm trying this new sweatshirt that I
just got from Levi's how cute it's
actually a men sweatshirt that I'm in
section oh he says like the best I've
ever oh and I have to get my eyelashes
done in a sec take like a smoothie Bowl
he's on the car and I don't know
fighting over driver but yeah and I'm
kind of hungry
but yeah I need to go to my eyelash
appointment and I just like days when
there's like formals and stuff there was
just like so much to do and I'm like man
but yeah I also need to put on loving
tan because I look a little pale and
this is probably bad but I didn't do it
last night like this money or anything
so I don't have like eight hours for it
to like sit on me and then me to wash it
off so I think I'm gonna put it on and
then leave it on is that it really
horrible idea I guess it'll be too late
once you see this I'm gonna put it on
and leave it on like for our formal and
yeah the dress I'm wearing is black so I
feel like if it comes off on it it's
like black anyway it's like not like a
white dress um oh yeah but the one I'm
gonna wear tonight I just got from
revolve in the mail and it's black and
halter and it's really cute so yeah
oh I don't shave my legs because before
you self-tanning up to shave your legs
maybe I'll do that after my knowledge
came in there's just so many things to
do and I just don't know when to do them
but yeah that's what's going on I wonder
if I'm the life update for you guys
because you guys are asking for a life
update um maybe I'll do that later I
always think I was like doing like
80,000 things and I don't have time for
it but that's where we're at I just
realized that I didn't film a twink
or on the way
and now I'm back I always do this but um
you can tell that I actually went
because look at how much better my
eyelashes look cute oh and they cool I'm
just so happy I have eyelashes again
because they like to know that when you
left wanting to walk cuz it's already so
close I'm a Christian but it was raining
so I really hope you didn't like screw
it my hair too much maybe I will curl it
like at the end a little bit I'm not
really sure you know I'll post my
interest rate I'll be like who wants me
to come my hair at the ends or leave it
straight what do you think okay
I'll let you know what we decide oh also
I need a shower right now contain my
legs so that I can tan so maybe the next
time you see me I'll be okay so you
probably realize that it wasn't filming
but what I was saying is we put on fake
eyelashes and a V there are del
whiskey's and Co it's kind of wipe the
glue it dries clear and then you can put
black eyeliner over it and I look like a
little baby you look you can even make
up on onions ketchup this is the
finished look everybody and I did
anything okay guys we'll see you at
formalities yeah maybe I should I bring
my camera gonna be fun I don't know
Bridget it an opera okay yeah we're
