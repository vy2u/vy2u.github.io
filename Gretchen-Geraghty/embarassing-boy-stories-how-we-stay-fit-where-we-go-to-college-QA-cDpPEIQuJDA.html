Q&amp;amp;A with all my bass I'm Kendall maybe
Gretchen silly paper so we're just gonna
get into the questions cuz we don't have
that much memory card to play it's on
the camera what is your dream job I want
to be a singer but I can't sing so I
guess that's it definitely a dolphin
trainer
[Laughter]
that's like maybes always wanted to be
an FBI agent I was like yeah they always
ask this in my first class this semester
and they said what's your dream job and
ever goes around and is saying that they
want to be like some CEO and I was like
um realistically no you guys are gonna
take this seriously but I wanted me to
talk with trainer because it's so fun
and like I love dolphins
and everyone's like being so yeah I want
to be a dolphin trainer mine's fashion
designer but it's also singer what are
you guys favorite lip products aqua for
yeah I don't really use lip products
we'll call me I don't that Vaseline but
is that bad can you comment I'm not sure
I like that stuff that you do this angel
I know good it's our new favorite
chapstick I made yellow what if he likes
like you guys don't know honey bum bum
is it honey her to cook bum bum cream
like lotion it's been funny name from
Sephora I use your lotion so then I just
got they're like bum bum chapstick or
it's like buy the same brand I don't
know it's called but it smells so good
and me all of it and that's that's
everything so good oh yeah definitely
I very bit lip product it's like the
chapstick that the colored a laugh how'd
you guys stay in shape splash healthy
eating habits
well I play lacrosse so I just do that
and I try to pretend like I go to the
gym but not really I try to go to the
gym at least that was my solution but
four or five times you're good actually
and so later on it's been going a lot so
I love to like go by her that makes your
life big sometimes I don't care we love
I basically think everything we eat
whatever okay the reason I think this
question is because you guys are
obviously all like tiny and in shapes if
I'm like I'm sure all of them are
wondering like how you guys are so
little and I can shape you know not
really but okay also keep in mind
they're like younger like a goon you're
in high school you can literally like I
remember being a string bean and I would
eat berries every single night like
you're just your metabolisms like
running a rubber but now we call it
healthy choices instead of getting a
side of like potatoes get like okay
pretty much they like eat whatever they
want but just like kind of like I don't
know there's no scientifical reason okay
exhibit reason why I'm skin impatient
opportunity so like we actually eat
everything I think just okay maybe hey
wait but not oh you're too much every
day every day we've had profiteroles
creme brulee and poor brownie for dinner
maybe like equal to each other when I
was governor I do not whatever man man
you together became festivities you
every lawn for like in moderation and
just like not so much of it like eat
pizza we don't eat a whole pizza eat
like two or three slight break at least
one sweater day
yeah so even if it's running where is
the next place you go together how did
y'all meet
because we need to explain like the
relation here so Mandy is my husband
obviously you guys now keep felony for a
while
yeah baby cousin and then it's Mandy's
best friends are Kendall and Juliet and
so then I know Kendall and Juliet sure
Mandy until then we have a trip together
and yeah we talked like 30 times and we
all yell oh no like before I was like
Mandy like I'm ready to go and she's
like no you're not you don't have shorts
on and I was like oh my god well like I
have my hair done and then we had some
time shuo
guess my nerve I get so sad we are on
the same wavelength
okay yeah so I literally believe this so
strong that me and Maggie never became
really good friends really quick and
someone comes to my video just for all
waterside and then my new friend Cole
that I literally met two days ago it's
also a cancer and I'm like duh that's
why we get along so well enjoy that's
the cancer and I'm like this is why
we're vibing
I'm so different I know but like I like
always undertaken we always know when
conversations are going kind of but like
she just isn't Airy it's like we're at
like Lucy's really Pisces I'm like I'm
technically Pisces but like I think I'm
supposed to be areas but I'm you learn
to think I'm so done when they hear this
but like whatever where are y'all going
to college I'm going to Stonehill
College that's in eastern Massachusetts
probably near a lot of units by Boston I
may be before I get out
thank you so much am I ready gonna be
you know my top schools right now are
Maryland so comment below and if you are
going there thinking about going there
no they're literally gonna be like oh my
god like like Maryland class of whatever
I like tell her which one to go to okay
let me give this a but you could only
eat one food for the rest of your life
what would it be I love this question
right guys because you have to know
tater tots french fries you can make it
many different way it's great
Champa Simon - you have chance your
whole life no potatoes potato chips you
made me love french fries I love
breakfast but I stay good happy chickens
we I know what about the two little
every time I get sushis Mandy she gets
these little pegs mmm I hate it when
people of Gomorrah or salmon brother you
have to try them she beat me try that I
mean they're not good
nothing okay I don't know I feel like I
would take like generally like nothing
like how potatoes has a bunch of thing I
said oh it tastes like bread cuz bread
is like everything in life
finally Sinan won just kidding I changed
it a bit East to Josie's would be sue me
Mandy and Juliet on Halloween had a
sleepover Juliet's dad told us to go
stairs and he was like don't make any
soup like just go upstairs be a man to
keep sneaking back 10 series calling to
make the soup it comes back down he's
like Mandy's why are you making this
okay it's probably not funny but like
yeah we did she was she wasn't making
the soup and she told him that he was
cuttin eliminating the same so he has
Kendall she was making soup yeah - but
her brother comes down and we were like
any other gonna said they were making
this soup I mean I was running around we
see who is making soup and they're like
you could come to me I was like I don't
want it Mandy's be like I don't want it
he'd be like oh go clean it up a feeling
know what is the crazy story you guys
have hands together probably last night
or like two nights ago
well we did I mean Kendall in skinny we
decided to jump in and Gretchen was
already sticky boobs and she lost them
it's a pool but the next day and we
still get it by the most embarrassing
boy story I think this is fun oh yeah
I'll start wait which one should I do
guys we're trying to think of one that I
can sail out oh wait I don't know like
Yoanna mercy this probably no okay well
I don't mind I'm fed up a video before
so I would say if I said think that I
forget how I freeze the video but the
first like the night that I met this boy
you told me that he loves me and so it's
just super weird I've had a boyfriend
since my freshman year of high school
basically she's an angel you know
somebody could be well like you know
feeling I know and one was I love you
months ago I was on the phone with him
and like we were like talking like all
of last year and like we were never like
dating or like homage together and we
were on the phone together and then he
was like I don't party and he know he
was at a bar and he stepped outside the
bar to call me and as he was hanging up
the phone he goes oh and I don't know if
you heard me like you know when you like
pulled your phone away from your face I
got up here like I didn't know what to
say
like I said I love you boys there we did
you know purpose I don't know it was
like just like a thing and he is
that like cuz I'm not you say to do but
yeah it's like awkward but it's
definitely about the words but a gimmick
we just rented to be a quite a boy from
the elevator the Iguana boy yeah boy
okay so the last question we'll be
answering for USA is name one thing you
love about each other okay what I love
about man being arrested are kind of
like the same because they're pregnant
same person they're always just so happy
like anytime you say like any joke even
if it's not funny well even if it's not
funny bandy laughs and it makes me feel
so good good like once Gretchen sets her
mind to doing something whether it's
like just taking like Instagram picture
she's like no doing it like well we're
going in the ladies and reverently she
just does it and like she just gets it
done and then Juliet you're gonna be
like oh you're not thank you but this is
just like so true all we did put
together like I don't know how she'd I
guess such a like such a good you after
a stink about her like she's always put
together but we do see her when she's
out you see her like when should you go
to her house her broomstick she's always
good together
yeah but just that was a good parenting
thing I love the most about her is that
she thinks like everything's funny also
like even if it's mostly the jokes that
she makes herself issues always down to
do whatever looks like everyday the
summer I would be like so alone by
myself like sitting at home are I just
call it and on she'd be like yeah come
over like we Louise have so much fun
together no matter what company I'm
always like if I go to Kendall's house
like even if it's like a mundane into
words even simple it's I'm bound to have
like a good time it's kind of just like
really fun and just like it's just like
always with her
thinking about that Gretchen yeah we do
this one like so basically actually it's
like the most positive and like
open-minded persons there can be like if
you have an issue with anything she can
turn it and like switch it around to be
something positive and that's why like
my mom and like my parents and like
everyone just like love to have her
around all the time because she makes
everything like not even just fun but
like positive like if you're going
through a tough time like she knows how
to turn it spin on it and like make it a
good thing okay go home in your house
yeah and come to my house anywhere like
really close obviously we're really
close close to him but he's always done
yeah so she always tells me the cool
part in truth like if I have a picture
and I don't know if I look skinny like
cheesier talking about like somebody
that having just like my relationship or
something like she always knows what to
say it's not like a fake like oh you're
so right it's like JT's right that
situation when I think about Kendall I
feel like really I feel like I feel like
like mad but like Kendall you were these
funny instance events and it's literally
like when I can always do the same after
promised and really show privates feel
proud and we literally had the most fun
couldn't stop laughing and she honestly
makes me so happy like we're not mean to
her which is 11 sorry
she literally I'm sorry and I'll be like
no like wait that was something that I'm
sorry she'll be like yeah
wait can even see Kendall no we're good
man you know actually what you said man
is the most bubbly person I know like
she
always so had Neely even when I'm in a
bad mood she'll be like Julie its dolly
why are you in a bad mood and literally
start laughing for like no reason about
like literally everything else both of
you guys are so funny like so much like
she hears someone say something like oh
that comes from Yeti Yeti my story's
like no matter how for November she'll
never leave stop here like interrupt me
unless she has like some good input like
I don't feel like oh my god and she has
the best stories like thank you so much
she said I love listening okay mine for
Julia is famous for me gonna have like a
climax like an ending but it always
makes like solid happier there it's
great and you make me dougie - let's do
something not really good listener but I
listened anyway
and I was using a Kendall Kendall is a
good listener too Kenda listens to me
and she's really funny you're really
funny when me what was it like okay like
the ground floor being floor sings it
just like the hey like cats funny we got
a little bit odd okay there's seven area
do this from Angie like I feel like the
reason I always come to Long Island it's
not going home because I just wanted
when you are even though you're not
she's literally the third place I
suppose I like like being around me like
I enjoy your company just that I've like
never had this much fun on the trip and
just being in the room with them like
even fighting 24/7 like our little
fights they always end up laughing it's
like everyone is like I would never want
to be if anybody else like except her
camera literally negative battery
whenever any of us have gotten in the
fight on this trip like like say Li
Kendall said something mean to Mandy and
then I'll really Kendall like why are
you being mean to me like we always like
to you about each other and like are you
doing that then it goes like every
single way look we're all just like what
are you doing that me and you are yeah
so much so guys you're so cute I and I
wanted you to see the setup hello nugget
and this is what we've got going on so I
really hope that this whole thing wasn't
really loud it's like beach noise and
people but this is just the best spot we
have to film in front of the light and I
grab some paper towels to set you guys
up on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
