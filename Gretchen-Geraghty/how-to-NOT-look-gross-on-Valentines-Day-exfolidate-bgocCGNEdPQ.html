Valentine's Day doesn't matter okay it
was growing up I thought that it was
like so important and if you don't have
a boy or boyfriend or girlfriend or
whatever that's okay because you've your
friends and your family and other people
care about you all right so this is
literally just if you want to be feeling
yourself on Valentine's Day but know
that it's like not necessary and what
matters most is self-love so love
yourself this Valentine's Day be your
own damn Valentine remember last year I
posted a picture on Instagram and I was
like I'm my own Valentine so there even
if you are a relationship still love
yourself kids last year at this time on
Valentine's Day I did have a date I did
go to dinner and I'm still my own
Valentine so there but this year is just
gonna be Lizzy and we're gonna go dance
we cream oh yeah so right now I'm gonna
start getting into the process of it
getting ready for a date night and I'm
really excited to bring you guys along
because I feel like going on a date
something that's like so fun and special
and like an excuse to get all ready and
go all out but I mean you do you you
know what I mean just like whatever you
want but I got my nails done today
because that just makes me feel like
more confident and stuff and probably
first time for everyone shower just do
it I don't care how clean you think you
are you're probably a little dirty and
you'll just feel more confident in your
shower so I'm gonna hop in the shower
right now
actually at the gym this morning in the
nighttime so I throw out as much open to
class I'm gross his hair and yeah that's
like first step getting a clean slate
let's go and I'm back first things first
if you have hair that's as naughty as
mine Oh baby you gotta brush through
that and I recommend a wet brush guys
because other brushes will just like
actually rip their hair and I know it
sounds pretty bad but this is like way
better for your hair then normal brushes
it's more gentle
mine's extra tingly because I got it
highlighted yesterday so I'm gonna just
get all fluffy oh I didn't just show you
but I sprayed it's a 10 miracle leave-in
spray in it so that helps me brush
oh well all right now that we're all
brushed out and smooth but good for
lowdown me lift you up a bit
oh sweet here we go and I've tucked in
my towel so that for free to move around
it so a next step I'm going to be
exfoliating my skin and this is like my
life hack for what I want my makeup to
look extra good and whenever I go out or
like heaven important it matters
something I always always always use my
vanity planet to spin for perfect skin
spin brush before hand you guys know
I've talked about this baby for so long
now I feel like I've literally used this
for years and it's just loaded my
favorite brush for exfoliating my skin I
could talk about the benefit of
exfoliating with this guy forever like
it makes your skin clear it makes
reporters buy smaller and like your skin
just off from new putting on makeup so
your makeup looks like flawless you'll
see in a second like there's definitely
makeup leftover on my face from when I
just showered so you'll see like I'm
this kind of like brown tan makeup on it
obvious you see all that was actually
like left on your skin when you washed
it before without it oh another thing is
I know this little guy who's a bunch of
different heads for exfoliating lip so
there's I know there's like a bigger one
that you can use for your body and
whenever I don't get spray tans I would
always use a poor head Samar I thought
it would be nice it's foliated before my
spray tan but yeah this is definitely
like a must-have for going on a date
because you might look extra Follis and
literally whatever my makeup looks the
best everyone's like oh my god like what
makeup are using it's not because the
makeup it's because about you do
beforehand your skin have used the code
exfoliate date get it exfoliate you me
it's everyone without this guy keep
calling it a guide it's a boy this is
the boy I'm going on my date with guys I
don't get a date this becomes so cheap
it's literally 30 bucks so go buy it
what are you doing I'm gonna let you
down below in description box you can
check it out I'm using the purity
cleanser this has been like my day one
oh so I just do a little bit like that
on there it's just like a really good
gentle cleanser does break me out I love
it hey I told you can you see that it's
kind of like grayish Brown that's all
the makeup that was like left on my face
I know that a model ring stop time to
start all make up oh yeah come back and
I change into this shirt and you
I got you why are you wearing this comfy
love brandy melville shirt for your date
night well guys my Valentine's Day this
year the lenses are Lucy and we're just
gonna hit the sweet green so that is why
I'm wearing this if you have a real date
with a good boy or girl whatever have
you like a real date obviously dress-up
cuter but that's just not gonna happen
for me tonight since I'm wearing this
okay it's the first drugstore product
I'm using my face is the Revlon
Colorstay a makeup and I got this shade
at 2:58 fresh beige and I remember last
time I use this they didn't have a pump
so I'm really happy that I got to come
down and turn out this little makeup
sponge if I'd like it to let guys know
it's low because I was like a silicon
thing here and a spongy part here I
don't know I'm going to tell you what
kind of his or anything I haven't used
it yet this is my first time using it
giving it damn first and I'm gonna apply
with the silicon part burs I've heard so
much about that some people love a pie
made with this so let's see this it's
like I'm really like even way to put it
on your face I guess I'm liking this so
far and all I remember from this
foundation eyes I used it so much in
high school middle school and I skin was
like super bad it was like super full
coverage but I'm hoping that by using
this little sponge it'll like kind of
blend it out more so I want to use the
kind of good start even on my cheeks
that get red or pimples or anything so
yeah I just feel like for dates like
full coverage I mean literally do
whatever you're comfortable with
I just feel really comfortable when my
skin looks like flawless wow this is
like very shady to and everything good
job Gretchen look at that imagine me
perfect okay then this is like one of my
all-time faves and I feel like it's
probably your eyes to definitely ever in
sort of this Maybelline it's an age
rewind eraser and I got the shape like
cuz I really like a light under I do
okay just do a little triangle
underneath and then I go on my eyelids
as well then I'm just gonna be blending
within this little spongy do it again
who's caught me oh he beats my heartache
yep okay she is hell up what's up
oh no I'm getting ready for our date I'm
gonna go in with the covergirl clean
matte powder how was our dopest and I'm
in the shade 535 and medium like this is
also one of my all-time favorites I
always used to use this I don't know I
haven't used it it's literally just like
the Mac Studio Fix I said not as
expensive and if you use like a full
coverage foundation with like a nice
foundation powder your skin just looks
like so will fall is okay now I'm using
the Maybelline brow precise pencil I
know me the color soft brown which is
exactly the color of my eyebrows and
minor Willie's bars on the front so I
always have to draw it on a bit more so
now that I have drawn it all and you can
see it's like pretty are so I always
take a spoon and just run through it
let's do it blush I picked up this
Milani it's called the color harmony
bronze first and OH - it's like a blush
palette but I also think it was pretty
like bronzy so my hope is it can be a
blush and bronzer in one that would hold
on I'll fix that
I like this car it's very like Corley
and bronze do you that's my bag okay now
I like this much blush but if you guys
don't like it like that strong you don't
have to and I mean is this shimmery part
and just apply it with my fingers the
highlight is so pretty look at that glow
and I always like to put some right here
on my nose then I picked up these
L'Oreal eyeshadows this is the shade
okay so my camera just died however um
the eyeshadow that's on you I'm using
are the L'Oreal infallible eyeshadows
this is a eight iced latte it's so
pretty I just put it on and I literally
use my fingers kind of trash I don't
know cuz it's just the easiest and 898
bronzed taupe which is so pretty that in
like normally you'd put on the guy liner
mascara and stuff except I haven't
really been wearing eyeliner all that
much and I feel like I've eyelash
extensions obviously and I think
something looks so full almost looks
like you're wearing eyeliner but I
always use the L'Oreal telescopic carbon
black on my bottom eyelashes if I
remember a lot of times I think I don't
even wear lot of mascara but this is by
far my favorite jokes for mascara and I
always use it when I don't have I got
your attention I think that is all for
my makeup so what's your say like in
full and glowy and you can go like it's
crazy or not as crazy with like a shadow
as you want and I recommend like all the
products I was showing I'll have them
linked all down below so you can check
them out and right now I'm just gonna
blow dry my hair and that's pretty much
it
to Aki LOD I'm gonna stir it into
because it's like very puffy from blow
dry me and my hair just usually gets
like this I found after I get high light
it's good it's like so I don't know kind
of damage you know for my light so I'm
just gonna go through it straighten it a
bit it just makes it kind of more smooth
and less puffy you know what I also just
put on more dark like closer to a my I'm
inside of my eye just to make it a
little bit darker because I thought it
looked a little like we're going for the
night
sultry thing look you know what I mean
so this is the finished look I just
ruined all my hair and yeah so going to
securing it Lucy for my Valentine's Day
it was so much fun and like I said even
if you don't have a real romantic day
just have a galentine's day and it'll be
great thanks for watching and I'll see
you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
