reunited say my family she's very
involved and just did I get one last run
in Fulton but for a good reason
Meghan obviously I don't have to fold it
I was like I can use my frickin hands no
just go bobbing in fiallo
I was gonna vlog on the train this
morning so I felt so nauseous I thought
I was doing literally throw up all over
that dream but I didn't yay when all I
eat is burgers and fries and steak this
weekend so I just made an acai bowl to
cure me long day how did you say how was
your day been it's been all right
111 I know five percent 905 I am haven't
blown bleep at all today it was like
what 10:45 p.m. I just got to Lucy's -
today was probably the worst day of my
life and it's really sad and that's why
like a look at how puffy my eyes look
it's cuz I was crying all day do you see
how puffy my eyelids are yeah it's so
bad
that's why I was like I need my little
and I'm still here boxes we can come in
and sleep over with you yeah Ann Arbor
smells good can you hear those he's
apartment yet one day I'm gonna do an
apartment or a boosie's apartment I kind
of it's so nice it's in Brookline and I
love it
this is such good lighting now I got it
in this spring and it says like solar
there Lucy always because he's vegan
cookies it but this time they're extra
get her so me today was really sad and
it was much about you
you look tiny though yeah basically I
got a bunch of head news today and it
was really sad you know it was he
probably a part of why I was so sad
he's probably cuz I'm like physically so
exhausted because I realized I started
this morning at 5:00 a.m. in Mandy's bed
in Long Island and then I got myself to
Syosset and sauce a different station
and then Penn Station to Boston and then
Boston back to my dorm so I was like so
much traveling so obviously like tired
and exhausted from this weekend and you
know when you're tired you like
overreact more but it wasn't even an
overreaction like today was like really
devastating news I'm like not ready to
talk about it
like really personal and I don't even
know if I can't talk about it anyway but
whatever basically I don't you know that
even when I was like crying and like in
a ball on the ground in classroom today
to anyone that walked by me for watching
this video and you're in class you're at
BU if you saw me on the ground and the
third floor in the hallway that was me
crying my eyes out but I'm one of the
guys know there's a silver lining
everything and even when I was sitting
on the ground crying I just kept
thinking that like everything happens
for a reason
I always tell myself that even though J
I couldn't figure out what this reason
was I fit this so like dunno how you
keep talking about it because it's like
so mystery and I can't talk about it so
I'll just stop but um even when you
don't know what the reasons are for
things
there's always really yummy vegan
cookies or not begin whatever we don't
discriminate I was a vegan and
gluten-free look at that so I use
everything anyone every time we make
them they come out different those teeth
every time this batch is really what I
want to say is be in communication with
your professors because today was like
really really rough for me and I missed
like a pretty big assignment cuz I just
was going through hard time and I talked
to my professor and she totally
understood and like basically just being
communication with your professors like
go to their office hours just being
contact with them because it just means
so much she was like of course you can
have an extension so I'm about to email
her something right now and it's like
11:00 p.m. you know and it was due at
like 11:00 a.m. so just like yeah
basically everyone's human and like her
professors get that especially in
college and juggling a million things
and trying to be an adult and find
yourself and you know what I mean so
anyway
I'm gonna send her to see now bless you
vicious cookie and cuddle it Lucy right

got I got to walk back to where I live
it is like numbing Li cold I can't move
my hands so I just say goodbye so I can
put my hands in my pockets
so now it's like twelve once I got back
i sat in the lobby for a while actually
I was talking to guys named my friend
Spencer and that was my friend Aggie
obviously you guys I'm Aggie
that's why I'm so tired oh yeah and then
I came to Abbey Louisa's room and I
talked to them forever
and really coming over so tired so now I
got a shower and go to bed so that is
all I really like that new gym we went
to that was really great the way I think
of it it's like I really like doing
cardio outfit rec but I really like
doing like weight and like ABS stuff
there so I think I'm gonna try to do
both and like I just remember I use two
three four summers ago some are going
towards senior high school oh my god
that was probably four summers ago what
am i Lucy me I work out like twice a day
every day you know in the summer if you
are in high school and you like play
sports or whatever or the summer you
just week really ramped up training and
like workout twice a day everyday and I
don't know I just like that could be
good for me and like I notice when I'm
like on a tighter schedule and more like
I'm more just disciplined and like
productive and stuff like today I
actually did my reading for my homework
which is bad to say but sometimes you
know it's hard to get that done when
it's not like completely necessary you
know what I mean like if you don't have
like something to do if you're supposed
to have like knowledge on a topic
sometimes you like wait till the weekend
after or whatever today I was like I'm
gonna be productive not going to the gym
in the morning I did my reading I did my
laundry
I couldn't have room I had a video I
uploaded a video
I like vlogs obviously I grocery
shopping how much the gym twice I like
you know I just had like a really
productive day like for me to be
productive I need to be like more busy
that makes sense okay I need to just
have like a really well thought out plan
schedule because they don't be
productive if I'm trying to like stick
to it I'm someone that like really
struggles with free time like five four
hours at home like sitting here and I
don't have played out what I'm gonna do
I'll and by the whole time and I like
almost feel like anxious that I don't
know what I should be doing does that
make sense anyway I'm gonna stop
rambling I just said I'm really tired
but you guys know I could talk forever
we could chat all night long okay love
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
