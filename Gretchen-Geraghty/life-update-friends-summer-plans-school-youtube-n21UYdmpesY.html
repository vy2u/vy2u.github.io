we go fight back a little bit okay hi so
I'm not gonna edit this literally yeah
oh this is gonna be so weird but it's
gonna be like that one like life update
answering your questions that I do
before where I didn't edit it and
actually a lot of you were saying that
you like like that I didn't edit it so
here we are just chillin in my cozy bed
again and my room is becoming very like
bare sorry if it like looks different
and because I'm in the process of like
moving out and moving into my other
apartment in Boston for the summer I
guess that's where we can start
so plans for this summer I need a break
I'm like running around I just hope to
Lucy move out of her apartment and she's
going home today and it's kind of like
sad and nostalgic right now because
everyone's moving out like going home
for the summer if they are going home
but I just gave my dad some stuff that I
didn't need for the summer and then how
blue sea move out and then I'm just
staying so it's weird but yeah I'm gonna
be in Boston mainly this summer it's
gonna be like my home base if you guys
know me and know that I don't sit still
very often so I'm always like traveling
and yeah okay so I'm letting your boss
in this summer I'm living with a B you
guys are my best friends Abbi and Lisa
and then I find Hannah and we're gonna
be living just like nearby like
off-campus in an apartment that we're
like subletting for this summer and then
actually all of June me and Maggie are
going to be in Europe pretty much all of
June like the first week of June we'll
be in London and then for like 10 days
after that we're gonna be in Italy with
a brand that we're going with so it's
gonna be so exciting me like cannot wait
it's gonna be so fun I'm nerv in Italy
so that's just gonna be unreal wait
actually looks like we're wined a little
bit so this weekend um that way okay
what's today today's Wednesday and
Saturday and Sunday I think I'm actually
gonna go home and surprise my mom
because Sunday's Mother's Day and I like
wasn't gonna go home at all but I'm like
I want to see my mommy on Mother's Day
so I'm going home it's already Sunday
and I think when I come back Monday
morning because you guys in my friend
Aaron Idol saying over at Tufts
Monday night he has just like senior
formal thing so I'm gonna go with him so
I got to come back for that and then the
following weekend it's my grandma
Coriana is it graduation be here for
that and then there's like a fun
surprise you guys will see I'll show you
later on um and yeah so then we have
and then in July we'll definitely be in
Manhattan at least a little bit with
Abbey and like her parents I'm an
apartment there so we'll definitely
scoot to New York City a couple times
because my grandma Coriana my big NAT
will be there this summer so we'll have
to visit down and you guys know I love
New York City obviously I live there
last summer and yeah so it'll definitely
be there a bit maybe obviously go to
Cape Cod I've still never been to Cape
Cod which is just so weird because three
of like my best friends grew up there
and are like from there Ireland Maggie
and Emma you guys know so it's openly
that I've never been there so we'll
definitely have to like go there and
like maybe if our yeah Maggie's like
still home base is like Bridgewater her
apartment so I'll definitely obviously
go there a bit and then um yeah is that
it for summer plans and there's other
trips that I'm forgetting but that's
like the gist definitely like I want to
go to Montauk I'll have to go to Laguna
because now my heart like lives in Lagoo
and I freaking love that place ever
since I went or December so whatever
enough about summer plans you guys will
see as they come because it will
definitely be like random trips added
here and there um okay let's talk about
school so I just finished school Monday
night was my last final and if you guys
don't know I'm like a marketing
concentration in the business school
here at BU or if you like for God or
whatever and I know it was confusing for
some people because when I like drop
Finance everyone's like oh my god you
drop finance like are you just like not
doing school so no I was just being like
ambitious in the beginning and I had two
concentrations of finance and management
and finance and marketing in the School
of Management and that I was like wait I
don't like findings anymore so that I
dropped finance and I'm just doing
marketing and yeah so senior year is
gonna be pretty like I like that I can
be kind of tailored to like what I want
it to be because I want to spend as much
time as I can in the next year just
making really good content for my
channel and I don't know if you guys
have noticed like talk about this a bit
I feel like so much of my content has
been vlogs just because I've been doing
so much so I've been wanting it's like
bring you guys along and show you like
what I'm doing like today was one of the
funnest days I
such a fun time I met Maggie you guys
know Maggie obviously and then her
boyfriend Tyler and then Tyler's brother
is Kyle and then Kyle's
Kyle's boyfriend is Michael so me and
Maggie I met up with Kyle and Michael on
Newberry and they are like the sweetest
humans
I love them they're so cute and mushy
and I met them today and I'm like I love
you guys like can you adopt me like I
love them so today was just so fun and
yeah let's talk about that a bit um I
like there's just some people I've
realized in life I've learned a lot
junior year and I don't know it's been
such a fun like happy crazy exciting
year and I just feel like I've learned
so much like obviously up and downs ups
and downs um
Oh Taylor's a week was uhm but yeah
she's just happen but um I just learned
that like you can kind of choose who you
surround yourself with does that make
sense this is sorry this is gonna be all
over the place like these videos that I
don't edit always gonna be all over the
place because my brain is all over the
place um but yeah I just feel like I've
really surrounded myself in the past
year with people that like make me happy
push me to be the best me like lift me
up inspire me like people that I can
aspire to be like people that I don't
know I'm just like really trying to
myself with people that make me so happy
and make me like the best me and I mean
you guys know who you are I'm not gonna
like name names but like all my friends
and family and just acquaintances and
like professors and I don't know I've
just had such a great year of like just
the people that I like surround myself
with and yeah I don't know if you like I
know there's been questions in the past
couple months about like certain people
that you guys have seen in my channel in
the past or whatever but if you have
questions about people and you're just
like wondering where they are just know
that like obviously people come in and
out of each other's lives and people
will like grow and move on and some
people grow apart obviously and like
distance and where people live obviously
like plays into part of that but um I
don't know just like some people like if
I just come to the point that like I'm
21 years old and I feel like I'm mature
enough to know that like if someone is
in impacting my life in like a positive
way and if their impact in my life in
like a negative way like bringing me
down at all or just like not pushing me
to be the best best me or like
can't be myself from there I'm not
comfortable or do you guys know what I'm
saying like I'm sure you have some
friends or whatever whoever they may be
people in your life that are like
destructive at all so I don't know I
just feel like I've grown and come to a
point that like if someone is in adding
they're taking away and I don't need
that so I don't know that was really big
and I hope that like answer some bigger
questions about some people that you've
been wondering about but I'm not trying
to be mean at all like I'm just saying
like I don't know I'm just focusing on
the people that like do you know what
I'm saying do you energy do you get
where I'm coming from but anyway yeah so
that's that what else we talk about I
know I talk about school a bit what I
really like is that for my marketing
concentration I have a lot of like
flexibility what I was saying so I can
take a bunch of classes that interests
me that just count for like credits but
aren't necessarily marketing because
I've taken so many business and
marketing ones ready so I have a bunch
of like electives I feel like people
come into college and we'll just do
electives and like figure out what they
want to do as they go but I kind of like
jumped into well I did like bio at first
you guys know it's like bio and chem
those were like my science requirements
in the business school and then I went
right into business so I have so many
like electives and like humanities and
Social Sciences that I never did so
senior can kind of be fun for me and I'm
taking like psychology of sports and
philosophy of sports and I don't know
you don't I mean like stuff like that I
think I might take like medical ethics
like stuff that I just think is
interesting but isn't necessarily
marketing I'm doing like branding and
whatever so that's cool my favorite
class is past semester was luxury
marketing it was the coolest thing ever
and if they offer anything like that at
your school take it because it was just
so interesting or I guess everyone
thinks different things are interesting
but to me that was like the most
fascinating thing and we're like on
Newberry today like buy all the luxury
stores and I'm like I feel like I know
everything about them now because I've
just like write so many case studies and
whatnot so that's cool um I'm really sad
that Lucy left today because I love her
and having her here the spring semester
was so fun and she's obviously like my
rock in my day one being my twin sister
we literally shared the womb and I'm
gonna miss her so much this summer but I
know that like she'll come visit me in
Boston and I like
and I think she liked mainly be at home
like with my family but she'll probably
visit Darryl I guys know she dates Tara
who lives in Amsterdam um what else I
miss Mandy I got to see that girl soon
oh I might actually try to take a trip
to Long Island whenever I can squeeze it
it because I miss her and I love Long
Island I forget if you guys are from
Long Island I love that place I might
have to live there someday I live there
um I think I'm definitely forgetting
other things to talk about what's going
on in my life right now wow I just got
back from the room ah I love Hannah I
wish Hannah was living in Boston that
means somewhere but she's me Burlington
but she'll come visit a bunch of nah I
go to Burlington and whatnot um okay I'm
being the worst right now and like
literally don't know what else to say
and I want this to be like a life update
that was like clarifying and telling you
everything that's going on I'm still
single
hit me up boys I'm like literally such a
relation should be type person that I
like see you boy you be like oh my
wonders that like be my boyfriend like
I'm psycho like are you guys like me
like I want a boyfriend so bad but
that's exactly when you don't get a
boyfriend when you're desperate and I
like I know that too so your stuff to
chill everyone says you find a boyfriend
when you least expect it I totally agree
what everyone's gonna watch this video
idiot Gretchen's literally psycho I am
it's okay though I mean who else is boy
crazy like me because I'm gonna make him
um that's okay just know oh my god like
the next time I show like a boy or like
oh wait I just wanna talk about this if
I'm like in a boyfriend or something
people are gonna be like oh my god like
pray for him crazy but um Oh what I
wanted to say as I know or maybe it was
just Nikki I think I posted like a with
a couple boys and like my Instagram and
people would just think oh my god like
he's hot or like relationshipgoals
they're like whoa but like if it was
someone in like a relationship with me
at all you would know because it would
be me being like oh my god hey I love
you XO like you know so yeah if it's
just like guys that I'm friends with
that's that's that um I think that's it
Wow I am like blinking and like really
don't know what else to say right now
I'm the worst
I miss teddy I love him he's cute and
squishy as always but how about you guys
comment
questions down below of questions you
have for me and please comment like
videos that you really want to see this
summer because I want this summer to be
so just like creative and fun and
posting videos like I'm really happy and
excited about because like I said I know
I've been doing so many vlogs and not
too many other times videos but I wanted
to like sit down videos and like
actually how about this comment on your
questions down below for like questions
that you have and then I'll do like a
Q&amp;amp;A answering them and then you can also
do a video request of videos you want to
see and that actually is making me think
of a video that I've been supposed to
film that I was and that I was supposed
to film that I have been meaning to film
see this is what you miss when I edit
videos but now you get to see my brain
working um I was supposed to film I've
been meaning to film the lululemon vs.
Jim shark video for literally a year now
and I think I've said for a year that I
was going to do it and then I've never
done it so that is like top of the list
because I need to do that and tell you
guys what I think and I used to work
with Jim shark but now I don't anymore
so I feel like it's less bias not that
it would be before this is deja vu I've
definitely talked about this before
about how I need to film it and then I
still don't film it but um you don't I
mean so it's good that like I don't work
with either of them and it's just like
neutral and I can just talk about my
experience with both of their like
athletic products athletic wear whatever
okay this is giving a lot more play so I
gotta end this
it's ER leave your questions below and I
will answer them in a QA and do some
video requests and it can be a great
summer and just buckle in because do do
really fun and okay yeah okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
