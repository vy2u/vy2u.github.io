oh don't ever my computer please oh
that's my blanket don't do that excited
right teddy it's just so happy I'm here
I need to study all day because next
week are my terms
and let's just say I have a lot to learn
this weekend well I'm home I have some
errands if I have to run I have to a
bank mom I have to go to the Apple Store
I really need to buy new everyone's I
can plug into my iPhone 7 because I lost
those wait okay wait hold on
before I forget let's just sit any chat
really quick so I'm gonna really try not
to get emotional right now and I don't
think I will because now I've had time
to kind of let it all sink in and
process and last night was still really
hard but um okay yeah well I'm sorry
sure if you guys saw my Instagram post
about Ozzie Ozzie did pass away and it's
really hard to kind of wrap my head
around just because I've had him for the
second half of my whole life
we had over 10 years and I'm 20 so yeah
basically like being here equals being
with Ozzie if that make sense look
obviously he's always here and like
coming home last night and only having
one dog barking on dog running around
look obviously so amazing to see teddy
and like that's a huge part of the
reason I wanted to come home was to see
him but it's so really hard just not
having Ozzie here and like obviously I
miss him so much and like there is one
video I posted recently and one of the
top comments was like wait Gretchen like
how's Ozzy doing and I was like oh my
gosh like basically I found out okay now
it's October it's sad to or seventh I
don't know probably a week or two ago
but I just wasn't ready to talk about it
on YouTube and I didn't until now I
posted on Instagram
a couple days ago because I saw that
Lucy did and I was like okay I feel Lucy
supposed to unities you have a lot of
you guys follow her I should just post
as well so that
that follows our Instagram who knows but
I'm sure some of you don't follow my
Instagram and just follow me on youtube
so I said you pass away you did have
cancer but you had such a long happy
life she was literally almost 10 like
the max age Great Danes pretty much live
is like 10 anyway if you guys know if
you have a Great Dane they're just such
big dogs that like their bodies get worn
down and so easily and it's so sad but
that's really what happened and then
like cancer obviously so horrible and it
was so hard to see him not his normal
self at the end so yeah although it's
really hard to let him go and see him
pass and leave our family and everything
we're really happy that he had such a
long life and we're really happy that we
still ossetia keep his company and my
parents were saying how grateful they
were that um obviously the Ozzy for so
long and he was such a great dog but
also that was the back Tim begged and
begged our parents last spring to get
Teddy because they're like this would
have been so much harder without Teddy
because it goes from like a house full
of dogs and laughter and chaos to like
silence like without a dog it's so weird
and we really found that out I remember
we had our first Great Dane Lex hit
after he passed away
it was a little while before we got
Aussie and my mom would come home every
day and cry she's like I need to get a
new dog right now like I can't handle
this like every day I come home it's
quiet there's no one to greet me who is
she talking to greet me actually just
said it's horrible you know so yeah
there's no one with us and it's so funny
because I was showing him in videos all
at the end of the summer and I was
excited to come head oh I was excited to
come home this weekend to see him too
but pleasures how things worked out and
I'm happy that he's playing with all the
other dog using the sky and he's not in
pain anymore
I can't afraid so yeah that's it I just
need to have something for you too much
stuff hello sounds like we just started
talking and reality we've been talking
for 40 minutes and 53 seconds yeah and I
told you I just have a minute I have to
be studying what do you say yeah I'm a
yeah I know it's only gonna be so fun
I'm so proud oh my gosh I hear Teddy's
tail wagging do hear it aha
what is it in her mouth Oh a towel you
love towels Oh Teddy how did you hear
Lulu do you hear I love you have fun be
careful so guys I just went to the bank
deposit some checks I've been waiting on
which is honestly dumb because basically
my bank is only here in Albany and not
in Boston so then if I need checks I
have to deposit them here when really I
should just have a bank in Boston cuz
I'm like not gonna live in Albany again
and I told it to my dad and he's so sad
he's like you're not coming
Albany yet and I'm like I'm sorry like
I'm just definitely not you know because
like I obviously live in Boston now and
fed on living in like New York after but
anyway and then I just went to Marshalls
because I booked a suitcase because I
just didn't have a big nice suitcase and
I was using like my family's and the
handle was broken and just a mess and
I'm like I just need to buy a big nice
new suitcase because I travel too much
and I'm visiting was he in
November and December for Paris somebody
I just need a big suitcase to hold all
my things and I've always wanted a hard
one because I think it's gonna protect
my stuff inside more so anyway that's
that I'm gonna go to Starbucks now so I
can actually set aside a person like I
can't be home I get distracted I need to
like go somewhere till I can make myself
study you know look who I ran - oh I
like studied at Starbucks like a hot SEC
but then I was just like I get so
stressed about it that I just can't even
do it so we're at the mall yeah and I
had to get a red dress red dress right
since we get no luck finding a good red
dress we literally went to so many
places and I'm kidding me just like Lord
&amp;amp; Taylor's are Abercrombie franchise
guys there's like no good red dresses I
think I just need to order some online
rent you oh oh yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
