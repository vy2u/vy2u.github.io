happy it's been like a week you know a
big date actually a lot of people have
thought that we actually date and they
like to eat me and DM me and stuff and
over the summer I was like something
like with my girlfriend cuz like I don't
know you just say it about your friends
you know and everyone was like saying
that we were dating yeah see like
Julia's with us right now he's my best
friend like you know really obviously
Lucy me come before anybody else but
like I know what I mean
but yeah we're not actually dating to
clarify she's just my homey
oh my god you guys okay so it is
currently 814 and and I just got out of
SoulCycle here in Woodbury
because I'm in Long Island right now
this to Mandy if you can't tell I'm
literally dying and he's like chill out
a second before I like drive like I
thought I was gonna pass out and you
guys know that time I look like an egg
right now like don't even look at me
you guys know that time in New York City
was like my favorite structure ever Alex
I'm obsessed with her but I literally
passed out in her class because I took
like a bread a the night before like
didn't eat it so like that was on me but
this one was just so hard you guys I
went with Cassie I want to say her name
is let me check and I remember coming to
her class before in Woodberry like I
came with Lucy and Mandy like a really
long time ago like probably a year ago I
mean yeah Kathy I remember being
difficult but not like impossible and
this one was like if you guys have ever
been to a can in New York City sorry
this is like a total like soul single
talk so if you're not interested just
like stappord a bit I went to a kin once
New York City it's literally a bloodbath
like getting a bike in that class
because they're all books like ahead of
time and whatever he's just like
probably the hardest instructor of all
time but her class was comparable just
there I'm like how are any of you
keeping up right now and it meets us at
make Boston sound like easy but Boston
is
so easy compared to what class I was
just in I'm like I know it's 7:15 like I
know it's early but like I should have
been this tired like I was dying oh my
god and by the ends like it was so I
think a part of it was like it was so
hot in there it felt like if you bend a
core power I felt like hpf level it felt
like 115 degrees in there oh my god I
like normally he doesn't bother me like
I don't mind working out when it's
really hot but by the end you know like
the walls are mirrors you couldn't even
see yourself in the mirror anymore
because it was that fogged up like it
was like this like oh foggy like the
window is yeah it was like that for the
front mirror so no one can see
themselves and she was like I know
you're all checked out right now because
it feels like the walls are closing in
because it's really so foggy but like
you can do it but that was literally the
hardest class ever is all I'm trying to
say if you want to get your ass handed
to you then I'm in subscribers and I was
leaving you so nice meeting you guys cuz
they just took the class too but like my
hair isn't like a sweaty bald mess and
I'm sorry I look like literally
disgusting
oh my god I'm fogging up the windows
look at cuz of how hot I am Abbi and
Mandy and lousier probably still
sleeping no definitely still sleeping
but I it was so weird because I like
really wanting to come but I just hadn't
alarm because I'm like oh like I need to
sleep we stood up really late last night
and then I just woke up and it was like
6:15 and I was like heck yeah I'm going
like I wanted to come anyway so I just
dragged my butt out of bed and came I
really need like Gatorade or like pee
every I like need electrolyte cuz I said
I'm gonna die and obviously tonight is
New Year's and so we're gonna like you

mixology commandingly the dessert except
we think it's closed because of Museum
food what you're like I think it's
closed

be out of the ordinary
