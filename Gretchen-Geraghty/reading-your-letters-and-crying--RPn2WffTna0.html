emotional person
I just read two letters that I got
because that's why I was saying all of
this my actress in case you want to send
me stuff because I got two letters which
came so quick because I like just at it
so recently and wait okay so the second
one I read Nadja and Maddie you guys are
so cute I literally love this good
morning guys it is like 11:00 a.m. right
now and I need to get myself together
really quick meiotic to living away and
I have to leave literally I'm like seven
minutes to go pick up my friend because
we're going to SoulCycle
go to my friend Issa and maybe I'll vlog
with her a little bit I think we're
gonna go what to a sweet green after and
yeah that's the plan I just knew today I
see like my most productive day ever
because I'm leaving at 6 a.m. tomorrow
which is my birthday which I keep
forgetting like that's so weird that I'm
trying to be one tomorrow but I'm
leaving literally at 6 a.m. because one
of my battery's dying hopefully it's has
enough a little bit so I can walk with
her anyway
Allu me and Susan have to go to Puerto
Verta so I need to be at the airport at
4:00 and it's a that savings time so
it's gonna feel like three and just yeah
it's gonna be tough but um yeah I just I
have to like film videos and such and
obviously packing whatever so yeah okay
well we just went to Seoul and it was
pretty rough there was one song that I
was struggling on the last two right now
and then the alarms I felt like were so
long at the very I knew me did the
bicycles again I thought my arms are
gonna fall but it was good I like Sarah
she was like motivating from oh my god I
can't even do this I would boss
it's scary so oh I miss subscribers she
was so cute I name is Tina oh my god I
don't miss it but I met her before
everybody she's like it was literally
like four years ago
yeah so I'm back from Seoul and sweet
green and it was so good it was like
just what I needed I made my own I put a
bunch of fruit in there it was so good
did I not even vlog iswi Korean oh my
gosh I don't think I didn't love there
because it was so packed the one on
Boylston get so packed in the weekends
but like just more than packed like we
waited in line so long easily out the
door and we had to wait to find like a
table so we were just so squished
together and so packed and I remember
thinking like oh I might pull out my
blog camera and then I was like I'm
gonna like royally annoy the people like
sitting around me cuz we were like this
close to the people around us so I
didn't wanna be like oh my god like
talking my camera and like bothering
people but yeah so that's why didn't
walk there but it's really got I'll
insert a picture right here was me my
friend ISA and yeah we went to Seoul I
also didn't vlog in Seoul because it was
so packed again right as we got in like
everyone was waiting in the Beacon Hill
one smaller than Back Bay I think so it
was just so packed like I couldn't even
move there like with no open lockers
like everyone was waiting to go into the
class and like I think people relieving
from the one before so it was just like
really hectic so I'm sorry and get like
really good footage but I'm back now and
oh my gosh
my friends are texting me Java um okay
so I'm back and I feel like I seem like
I have energy but I literally don't have
energy I'm so freaking tired right now
and I'm gonna try to be productive today
you know what not even try I need to be
productive today I really do because my
flight to Peavy leaves at 6:00 a.m.
part of IATA um but oh oh and I turned
21 tomorrow lol
crack I can open a coma with the boys
I'm getting this is an energy drink
oh so also my birthday every year is
always like daylight savings time so
even though my flight leaves at 6:00
it's gonna feel like five and I need to
be there at four but it's gonna feel
like three so it's gonna be really rough
tonight I don't know if I should even
try to sleep like I think I'm gonna try
to at least a little or else I'm just
gonna be so tired but yeah my crazy
going out turning twenty one night is
gonna
me going about a p.m. cuz I have a
flight at 6:00 he but don't worry all so
I'll celebrate it up in Puerto Verta
anyway so I was gonna show you guys it's
really quick it's my it's for perverts
energy drink and I showed you guys this
before in a blog when I first tried it
out and I've been drinking them so much
whenever I'm just like oh my god I can't
keep my eyes open
I taste so good it's raspberry
pomegranate flavor mm-hmm I know I told
you guys last time when I was showing
you that I love that they're like a
socially responsible company I know they
donate I think it's ten cents I think it
even says in the can they donate ten
cents for it yeah we give ten cents from
every can to make education accessible
to children around the world so I love
that they like doing money it for
education for children in developing
countries and I know a lot of times
people think that energy drinks are like
unhealthy and I feel like I kind of
thought of that before I tried them but
for Berbers energy made this organic
energy drink with like really high
quality ingredients I know I showed them
before there's like not that many
ingredients at all which is so good
because I think the less ingredients
better and they have all sorts of
certifications I know they're usda
organic vegan Fairtrade certified and
certified Kosher and if you don't know
what any of that means that's okay but
if you guys do know what they mean then
and you like that then that's a benefit
of this and again i know you can get
five percent off of their 24 pack on the
website if you use a code Gretchen so
I'll have them linked down below and
yeah let's keep to editing some videos
showering I'm still sweaty mmm wait guys
before I forget to tell you I know the
other weekend of vlog I told you guys my
address here which I know some people
weren't coming at that sketchy but again
like I said I've said so many times that
I live in to be here to be to here at BU
so you could easily look up the address
and all I really gave you other than
that as my box numbers you can send me
stuff if you want to but only if you
want to don't be don't think like I
don't want anyone to pick questions
annoying being like this is there you
can send me stuff you said he said but
like literally it's just from like
people damning me and messaging me and
leaving me comments and stuff being like
I drew a picture of you or like wrote
you a note or some or note or something
that I want you to have so if you do
want to send me stuff this is my address
in box number and I feel very
comfortable leaving you with that
because
I live in a 26 bar building with two
guards at it always so yeah what are we
gonna cry it's like an emotional person
I just read two letters that I got
because that's why I was saying all of
this my absentee so I send me stuff
because I got two letters which came so
quick because I like just at it so
recently and wait okay so the second one
