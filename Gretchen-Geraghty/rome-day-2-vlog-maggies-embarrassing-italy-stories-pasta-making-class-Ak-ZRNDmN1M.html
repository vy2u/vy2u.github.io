actually dr7 now we woke up on 6:30 it's
like probably 7:15 and we got to go down
to eat breakfast really quick and we're
leaving at like exactly 7:45 because we
can't be late to go I think we're going
to trevi fountain again very cute look
at her
hey says um but yeah we gotta go get
food we are so tired we literally don't
sleep here but that's okay like I just
don't know if this thing looks back as
it's black and white video just black
and white and then your shoes I like
black on the bottom I think it looks
nice we just got to breakfast and it
looks so good I like how there's so much
muffins and so much variety been like
before oh yeah I want to Kiwi
I thirst 76 entrances to the Colosseum
what and they're all numbered if we can
see a fairly that says xxx like one one
I I don't understand that means 32
we're inside are actually sort of inside
we're about to be really set but we just
went through like security that was so
weird my head footmen I know I like
think I can't blog one in my head and I
feel like I'm - like me - I like to try
and do too much at once
yeah have you guys been on tours like
this before by the way because I've
never had like tours like this until we
came here and - I was like wait a minute
what then like you just have one little
headphone so we can hear Tyson I keep
wanting to call him not taste and I
don't know why because we wanted to call
him my Kong Tyga and kind of when they
go behind because it's in a rendered
chicken history lesson like we're
learning right now from Tyga so he said
that on the guy that owns Todd's I
forget his name is David that's not
right he had 25 million euros hanging
around and he's interested in Roman
history Roman history and so he wanted
to clean the Colosseum
was getting really dirty outside the key
was like in the 1980 tour just like back
up into here and then this is like they
would turn like really dark leafy
exhaust like there was just so much
pollution that it looks like that
because it's all limestone but then you
saw on the outside it's like light and
pretty and so it's a good few joining
project that cost twenty five million
euros and it's gonna keep going to be
inside to interesting do you think all
those little holes happen because it's
so old Maggie or do you think they were
always there yeah it looks like a
cheetah
told us the Colosseum was made in near
eighty and then they stopped using it
like five hundred something we just so
we're that's a big year because it's so
long ago but and yeah he said it was
like turning into the Middle Ages so
then people were less concerned about
like entertainment and people fighting
and animals fighting and stuff to watch
and more concerned about like staying
alive and like having money because they
like a lost a lot of their mouths I
guess so then that's why I guess like
that performances like event shows like
stops happening and then people would
like to pick it apart for like raw
materials and that's why it's so like
rundown but it's cool that still there
you know what that arch the one back
there he said was about like religious
freedom like someone who did people
religious figure I should know more
about this and then I don't know about
that one
Oh guys we have like half an hour until
our pasta making class and oh my gosh I
literally see it I see it Maggie okay
we're in the way sorry
I see the pizza it looks so good anyway
we have a half an hour to our pasta
making class and we're gonna get that
because he's like we make pasta for so
long and talk resembling he won't
actually it's like free you might be
hungry at 11:00 so I'm really excited I
am exploring supermarkets and I am so
exhausted but I still love it it's
really fun and I'm having a great time
guys these look so good
any mag you're gonna split these because
we couldn't decide between the burrata
pesto and then like tomato mozzarella
basil so how cuter we update

and like memory and like we already took
a couple turns from our hotel and I'm
like I have no idea where we are like I
don't know anything

supposed to come like twice and then it
just didn't come so that's always that
shouldn't Maggie that's so new no she's
never even met yesterday she knows how
to uh it's all the Halleck a break yeah
I don't know and I did that so long cuz
there's like over anything right but I'm
actually really happy we came here
instead of the Coliseum cuz we were
there this morning and I just miss it
and this place is so beautiful here we
came into the other side today it's so
crowded Wow
oh my gosh Maggie this is more crowded
than yesterday okay while I'm down here

crowded it is okay we just took so many
pictures out there we finally finally
get opening to take pics and those

to like mention this yesterday when we
first started like maybe thinking that
it was going to happen because I didn't
wanna jinx it and I just said this on my
Instagram story but then I'm like wait a
minute this is like finally time I can
tell you guys and it's not even nothing
that I like need to announce but it's
just something that I feel like I need
to talk to you guys because I feel like
it's such a milestone in my life which
is seeming very like dramatic but it's
just like okay what I'm talking about
it's SoulCycle and Maggie and I are
going to be working with so cycle and it
literally is a dream come true and I'm
not even trying to exaggerate like that
is like the one brand that I am just
like so in love with and I've wanted to
work with forever but I just like wasn't
able to before and then like now I
finally get to and like it's just a
dream come true like Maggie and I were
screaming like Oh last night like I let
me tears in my eyes today like it sounds
so dramatic but like when you go like as
much as me and are just so in love with
being there and like I would say when
I'm happiest I'm at SoulCycle
I'm not even kidding like that is like
my happy place and it's just like such
good vibes and I'll never forget after
the first time I went or I think before
the first time Andy would go before me
and then the first class I took was in
Montauk and the first song was kill the
lights
and like I'll never forget it's such a
happy song and um me and he was like
Gretchen it's not like working out it's
just having fun but like you're just on
a bike and you get to work out too and I
just always think of it like that like I
don't even think of it as working out I
just think if it's like a good time like
I want to get a good vibe to be in a
good mood such good energy yeah we
always go and really always
one time I was snowing and it was a
messenger oh my god so stressed and they
were finding us when and also we were in
California yeah no good eyes are like
when you're running late and you're
overwhelmed and then you leave and
you're like ah I don't know literally
they're like the one brand I wanted to
work with ever and then I could die
happy so I'm just like beyond happy
right now
and I only had to go out to thank for it
because if it wasn't for you like I
wouldn't be in this position and I'm
just like so happy I'm so happy to thank
you guys for watching today's vlog I
love you so much I'll see you tomorrow
