storytime really quick and casually
we're literally sitting on the ground in
the airport right now
um lucky from work but yeah and I don't
were in like a good mood now and we're
good and better but I don't want that to
like undermine the severity of the
situation that we literally were in it
was a call hours ago because it was like
the worst thing ever but we tried to
like chill out and breathe and we got
here and make ate food and so now we're
in a good mood because we just ate so
much longing in here like we lit french
fries I was so shook yeah but really
were social we got off the plane and I
was I on the ground we looked at each
other I mean like I like become pretty
tears I was like yeah Maggie I was just
like okay I need to like sit and breathe
for a second because this is so scary
but you guys are not going to happen
okay so basically if you didn't know we
were in Italy for like eight days or
nine or whatever and then we flew back
from Rome to Montreal and in Montreal
the boss was a like a layover in
Montreal and then the flight from Rome
to Montreal is like eight and a half I
know it was really eight forty five is
how long it took almost nine hours which
is like the longest light maggie's ever
been on yeah I'm still like a really
long flight for me who even flies a lot
and so I was like loaded up on movies
watching movies and Maggie was I think
you were just listening to music like on
your phone mm-hm
and this is like my take of it and tell
me if this is how you felt because all
of a sudden I just like I started to
feel like turbulence and I just took out
my headphones and I look at Maggie and I
looked at you I was like and she just
goes are we ok are we ok like what's
going on and then like right as she said
that I was like whoa like I don't feel
okay and I felt so like lightheaded and
I felt like your facebook Pam I we just
were like regular literally so my god oh
so scared because what was happening was
it wasn't just normal turbulence like
I'm used to it being just like clouds
and like bumpy right yeah it felt like
the plane was like dropping I literally
fell away anything and then it would
caught on and then it would like go to
the left and then we
right and it was with so much in
MIDI the feeling and my stomach was one
that I never felt my god I was like I
didn't want to say this when we were on
the plane like literally until we landed
but it was and we both agreed we were
like wait I was thinking the same thing
it was like one of those things where
like I literally was sitting there and
if I was fine I really was gonna text ya
Tyler my family I'm gonna be like I love
you because it was not scary and I just
feel like in that moment I yeah my like
life flashed before me I think it was so
weird I'm just like I think now it
sounds so dramatic like I don't want you
guys to be like you guys seem so
dramatic because they're even know I
think it is there we were crying it
Thunder not holding each other like this
yeah you're soaking wet
I was literally like I had like this the
rest of it but everybody else everyone
was like looking at the windows never
scared anything mm-hmm and it was so
good oh yeah what I was going to say is
I looked at them happen the first thing
I noticed was that we were literally
click right smack in the middle you
ready go to like the water and we were
like we both look to each other with we
have five hours left on the slide like
we're not even in like half what have
you I was shaking so bad and it was so
scary and the fact just watch to drift
the movie with shailene woodley no she
was freaking out about that be for the
past like we yeah and like we were gonna
be adrift like I thought we were gonna
frickin land in the water this is Lily
what I thought I was like me and now
you're gonna be on a life raft like I've
literally thought it all that was like a
wonderful like survived the impact of
like landing on the water like awful
that's what I was thinking and ok the
scariest part which I wanted to mention
was the noise as the plane was making oh
then it was his first but I wasn't like
it was just really loud and I remember
in the beginning of the flight thinking
because like I know what a plane sounds
like it's not quiet it's loud but like
if you have no head it's really like
bold volume you hear it only a little
and I could barely hear my show like it
was just a last thing Aladdin it was
literally like it sounded like something
was wrong with that yeah we both saw
something was wrong with the engine but
we wouldn't say because I was like
that's really scared and plus I would
absolutely when it's time to be like
four I mean me I don't freak out I was
yeah it was an Air Canada flight which I
feel like it's probably just a normal
airline like not shooting on Air Canada
but it was lit like this Gary slide it
on and oh yes the noise the planner is
making I think it would like get really
loud and then it kind of quiet
they were like putting the engine on
full blast and like beating and then
slowing down and then we've drawn yeah
and maybe we hear it and it would be
wicked loud but we literally be like
shaking shaking and yeah everything was
happening so happening so quick that I
was like I literally record and okay and
we knew something was wrong or like
something was up or like I don't know
because the flight attendants were
running up and down again no one came
over the loud here yeah they like we're
just I was like waiting for you happy -
turbulence
yeah and literally nothing yeah nothing
so I was like freaked me out they many
thing and then literally if the captain
was just like just two guys know this is
like some intense three minutes like
make sure you say there's winds and
whatever no I would have been like okay
yeah I think that's why we were scared
and the flight of times running up and
down mean I keep your seatbelts on
Keepers he pulls on so like and people
would try to like and move after the
fact and then but I went to the bathroom
they still yelled I mean yeah they yell
at me and the seat belt I'm like you
know what it's still on a little bit but
like there's no turbulence but it's
still on you can still work that
something literally were yelling at
people who like sit down they're like no
sit down sit down and we were like that
was so very scary I would say that like
me thing like panicked in chalk in like
adrenaline and like palms sweaty knees
weak was really probably like five
minutes but it was like terrifying and
then I started to think I was like
retching it's okay think about it the
past like 50 years probably one flight
has gone down like you're okay you're
fine it's not gonna go down the middle
of the Atlantic like you're gonna be
okay you're not gonna be adrift like
that's not gonna happen and and then
afterwards were texting our friend Jenn
yeah done okay friend he was like do you
know that like Google commercial
airlines don't go down like you have a
worse you have like better you have a
better chance of getting in a like a car
crash or a train crash than like you're
playing getting in a crash really yeah
braking or something which is so we are
injuries and everything are much more
dangerous than please yeah
- but just in the moment when everything
somebody explained these various
different against people we up scare
like that like that's scary I was like
right now I want to be on the ground I
don't do it I mean we're like debating
whether or not we should maybe rent a
car and then drive back to Boston
because we were so freaked out but then
once we landed and we like talked to our
parents we talked to everybody and
knowing our sites only an hour back like
we're literally gonna go up in the air
I'm like not even want okay and then
just like go right down it will be a bob
says everything will be here but it's
just really feel like you're getting in
a restroom we're gonna drive you don't
wanna like wonder how long it's gonna
take
I feel like now looking back he was only
like a what two hours ago now like in
the moment and right after he seemed way
more scarier than like it seems now but
it's like really serious it was that was
scary most terrifying feeling I think
you figured a new guy like a drive like
sleeker flash I was like oh my god it
like hit me it was like oh so go ahead I
need to stop like you're taking not
taking things for granted not letting
take things for granted but I just need
to be more appreciative of like
everybody in my life and everything
about yes and everything that I do like
I feel like I was saying this the other
day people don't realize or they don't
take that for granted until like
something happens like for me I was
thinking about this after the whole
thing happened with Kate Spade and like
yeah guys know about that which that was
waiting himself to for Dean I don't know
but you have so many people committed to
science more like yeah I decided I could
hurt me so much people once Kate Spade
did that everybody was posting about her
and they were like oh my god I loved
Kate saying I loved my Kate Spade bag
but literally before that happened
everybody was like being like oh my god
Kate Spade so like outdate
you know and like we're literally not
users of exactly where we serve
recognition choose life that's what
we're saying like yeah it's just nothing
that we're talking about
it's like you say the happiest memories
and like why you love them so much and
it's like say that right now and it just
made me so much more appreciative like
now like if I like I forget but you have
been trying to be better at this like if
I buy something that has cute shooters
and thing I'll be like those shoes are
really cute like you look really good
like have a great need to just like tell
people because like if you don't then
like what if they were having a really
bad day and you couldn't either day
after bag but yeah what else did I want
to say oh the reason I really wanted to
make this was not to be like too
dramatic or make you feel bad for me
like we're fine we're literally chilling
we're about to go back to Boston but I
want to make it because a lot of people
ask to for us to say it because I post
on my stats right yeah and we were gonna
talk about it in the vlog but then I
feel like yeah this would have literally
taken up your whole columns of your vlog
yeah so I think of just what it is here
to like tell the story I just wanted to
remind you because this is what I kept
thinking I really was praying and I was
just thinking like I love my family so
much and my friends and people in it at
my close to me and then I wish I could
tell him even more than I already do
that I like love them and I care about
them and that they're the best so just
like reminder right now go hug your
parents and your pets and your friends
boyfriends yeah but I think that's
pretty much it I really gonna be
anything I don't know well just for like
the whole rest of the flight we
literally were just sitting there scan
every single bump we'd feel we feel like
I was trying to distract myself
Maggie it wasn't like audiobooks I was
watching movies like yeah but for the
first at least hour or hour and a half
to two hours I couldn't do anything I
couldn't focus on an errand harder after
I was so sure because I was so scared I
just wanted to get out of like that area
my ID center the ocean I just didn't
want to be over the ocean anymore
me neither I know right is we were like
getting close like being Overland that
just made me feel way better than being
over yeah I don't know why I like need
to just did
oh no this is our site that we really oh
my god I was like I'm never flying over
the Atlantic Ocean again everyone yeah
but we're literally going on six days
some day you guys are gonna be like
