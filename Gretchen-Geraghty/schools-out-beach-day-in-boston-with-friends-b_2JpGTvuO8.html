like this is like broken and what go in
like like all the lenses stuff so like
wouldn't I stop filming it'll like not
close over it like it's supposed to and
then this won't go into the camera and
so I finally got insurance and he was
like $200 and then like a week later a
new one so I was like good thing I'm a
turns because if this carries like 900
so if I got like I didn't get insurance
I knew that I'd pay for like anyone you
know and then once I got this guy okay
