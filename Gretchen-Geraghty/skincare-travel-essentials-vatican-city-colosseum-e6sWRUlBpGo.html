bathroom it's kind of like you know the
orange in here so hopefully doesn't make
lady plain consult before 7:00 he's like
6:45 - I think I've got up around 90
6:15 but it's been very slow moving
because my keen eye very tired I just
have a little body shower Hank's my
towel and I didn't have the energy to
wash my hair but I washed it like
yesterday you know but welcome to our
bathroom because this morning I wanted
to show you I've been meaning to do the
whole trip but now I'm gonna do it
because I want to show you like my
secret for traveling and when I must
bring and that's my ability a planet
ultimate - Skin Spa like face brush and
I used like an another one by them
before but also this one and I kind of
will just change that because I have
like - from then from that and the other
words feels like a small my brush head
but I really like this one because I
think it really cleanses my skin and
we'll have a package for you and if I've
any make it left over you'll see because
it'll literally come off in there and
you know like I said Mr Bond even after
I use like a makeup wipe or whatever but
like right now we don't since I just
showered
and like I took out my makeup last night
but anyway yeah so I wanted to talk to
you about it because I feel like when
you're traveling can I put you down
right there so this doesn't fall so the
reason I really like that for traveling
is because I feel like especially when
I'm traveling like especially like right
now we're in
and like really along the plane rides
and just traveling with like new cities
in a new environment like really dumps
on my skin and I like needed something
to exfoliate it so by just bringing this
it's like so helpful because another
thing exploits my skin as well as this
little guy does you can ever you're like
normal exfoliating scrub II creams but
um I just find that this like works so
well and Lily after you use it your
skin's like glowing and so soft like you
feel the difference and you put
moisturizer all right
moisturizer new skins like glowing oh
wait you step one let's put up my hand
so I was kind of unprepared Minister Oh
No okay I was I wasn't prepared but as I
didn't bring like face wash for me maybe
I did bring face wash but I didn't
require much I always forget bought in
Monaco places because I'm shampoo
conditioner good lotion whatever but I
always forget body wash and then the
first day girls on the trip are so nice
and they like an extra bar of soap and
you never realize how much you need a
bar or soap until you don't have one and
yeah I've been using it really the whole
trip on like has like body soap also
face soap literally guys my skin is so
clear I've noticed whatever I've just
reverted to like very clean things for
my skin my skin is so clear and like
glowing I remember when I cut filming
job a year ago I only could use a khabar
so by my face every day when they would
give you a bar of soap in the hot water
in the morning and we just give them so
clear okay anyway getting sidetracked so
I just got this wet and then I just
literally rub this on here like a little
bit because yeah that makes it okay you
know you can take some nice and soapy
and I hands also be normally and I'm
going to be too bad because I don't like
when it looks very water whoever
like that that's good enough and then
you just click the button and you
realize oh this is like wake me up -
it's okay we're about to go to the bat
again this morning and I'm so excited up
but that obviously you don't care about
it so much but I gotta find it now
hope windows but I find an outfit that
makes my shoulders it needs to cover yes
oh yeah oh I didn't even tell you okay
you probably Gretchen where can I get it
so look a sentence from the enemy planet
I know it comes out before a video okay
I I really really bad multitasking I can
do two things at once but I'm done
anyway you kind of see it's a kind of
tan tinted because we're literally this
no makeup on my face but um you can use
it the link it down below for 70% off I
haven't put them below and yeah it's
like a really great deal that they're
giving you guys send a person off
because usually it's like kind of
expensive but with somebody breeze off
it's a little assembly personnel so
definitely take it I'd open the front of
my no we can really close really quick
hang on okay I've put on clothes so I'm
wearing this new dress I got from Zara
I am so bloated because we've never
eaten so much pasta and bread in our
life but that is okay you know it's fine
love yourself am i right and I know my
shoulders aren't covered obviously but
I'm bringing a denim jacket II thing
that I have and right now my sniffling
sorry I have not been putting on enough
moisturizer but my skin feels so it's
all from doing that I'm gonna sauce on
some moisturizer real quick we gotta Jed
and I'm not putting on bingo you know
because sometimes it's good to be
all-natural and especially my skin will
be glowing so I just put it on very
haphazardly um and I've been talking
like molasses because I'm so out of it
but we should go again if you want to um
I need a bruised off she'll fall so
being just chillin
when does that turn on so hard if you
want to get your own vanity planet of
risking spot rush
Ling's down below it will be 70% off for
you lucky little chickens get our doctor
breakfast
it is 717 and we have to be out of here
at 7:30 so this will be a quick course
on and then we'll leave
I forgive me love the breakfast here
it's so good good morning and yeah I've
most-played breakfast you look so much
prettier but I got two croissants
chocolate croissant light or die and and
my egg is proud to put on the inside
it's light you know so I plan everything
Brown we out here I'm trying to be like
you not bloated to be better to feel
like eight years ago me the day I fell
asleep standing up
my microscope better than you've been
waiting in line for 80 years and
everyone thinks I'm not gonna get into
this much my needs are showing what we
find I can pull this down and then we're
chillin right right
pictures or videos or anything where you
may go and show this vlog I'm not
waiting no one tell me please I don't
wanna get arrested for the smog phone
down I was like click and it was just
like upside down and like I really just
want to show you guys
there's on the ceiling like that
right now Michelangelo painted it for
years I don't know where we are
we'll figure it out and he he said that
he like like Michelangelo painted
anymore like and so then we like try to
come back and the guys like also before
we do they start on Terra okay now as
you talked about okay it's in the
elevator so we're going to thank for
because if you can't go back that way
and I put me all Lots from our group
music okay fine like go back you have to
get in an elevator and go before then
you'll be back at the Sistine Chapel and
you have to go out the other exit we
just didn't know that there's two we're
literally like you can't go back that
way for betterment like we lost help
only uh okay guys now i buy these
paintings again that's where the
elevator brothers and we're legit by the
beginning and we have to walk so far to
find a Sistine Chapel and thank you our
group is gonna be way ahead of us now
like we're ahead of them but now there
okay we made it this is the Sistine
Chapel again round two
okay since Pete's got to go in twice for
you I know he's so bad but like okay the
whole reason they do it is so that's not
like the Mona Lisa Arturo I said like a
million people are there and you like to
stalk and much waiting it and like
taking selfies and stuff like I supposed
to be at the more secret space and or
like just pausing getting pictures they
just want people to like forget it
so like we weren't disturbing it now
we're outside we're confused yeah guys
is this right Twilight is divided akin
City right I click it's out here in the
square when it's like noon or whatever
time and Edward Ernie will get sunny and
Edward starts to be a vampire isn't it
now you're not a vampire you know what I
mean like his skin sparkles it's out
here and we're still trying to find our
tour group I think they're this way no
okay but just like look this is cool
okay guys we're separating ourselves
again because the one thing I just knew
I was here that my dad warned me so
wanted me to see so bad if I also want
to see it's called la or no it's just
called no we can't we just go there and
go left all those people are standing I
don't think so no oh okay well I see the
curtains anyway we're going back to
those curtains because we have to sepia
de pietà is I hate it um by Michelangelo
into sculpture and it's Mary holding
Christ after he died on the cross and oh
yeah my dad's in st. Peter's done and
Laszlo smashed it with a hammer like a
long time ago and you have to go to any
sane place here so I don't know just
like a cool story behind it and that's
why Mary doesn't have her armor Island
so I have to go dad look at how many
people there are looking at it I'll get
closer but there it is
we're so far away this is like what
happens when you try to see the Mona
Lisa there's a million people look at
everybody oh my god did her arm yet put
back on I'm gonna look at maghirang up
uh-huh wonderful I just sheer violence
again let's see enhanced as close as I
can to many folks to the fair
yeah okay now we can see she's dialyzer
it was hope George's
yep there that where everything got put
back on get it marry that is so cool
she said over there at 12 on Sundays the
Pope comes out it's really cool and okay
I keep thinking that this is where the
Volturi are and I'm Twilight but I might
be completely wrong so don't hate me
because we're just not sure and if you
know where that is
tell me you know when I told you when
Edward comes out you and their skin
sparkles like where is that yeah let me
know
we attend successfully took the bus but
violent payment and I must be a
physician
I wish we showed you but then I pressed
kicks out you know priority people home
answers the air condition in here
yesterday this is a good cross from the
Coliseum so we have to go around because
all that's like blocked off and they're
saying
you can't just go with one cut to the
other you have like go around saw like
blocked off just like their agreement
right you're like the expander
I don't like fighting it it all seems
bright up there you guys can see we'll
be there in a sec pretty is it's so
pretty
this is such a cute spot guys well
they're not good biting but look at we
need that be little just stumbled upon
this great place and I'm so happy we did
you know what I've realized this whole
trip is every time we eat I always wish
that I had what you had okay good
and also I wanted to tell you I'm not a
big car weight it was about just a
carbonara
my big Chardonnay gap but this is so
good I think so yeah I think they always
make it all dente Wow we found this
really nice hotel and I threw the cheese
driving effect so that I sure did
it's a film a video and lighting so nice
yeah it wasn't much dinner was so good
though I don't even anyone everyone - it
was like the video main highly recommend
because before we took our little box
and ass I use the Barbie fan spray and I
use them in to like rub it on and I just
did like my face and my neck and took
that was like I was starting to get like
tail and I knew I didn't want to put on
makeup after I like shower away so then
I just think I'm a really cool of you
from that and I love doing that like I
never knew that trick to just like sup
terror here face and sort of like makeup
so it's only my friend that you do it
and like manages all the time that I'm
like why are you so tan like it's like
