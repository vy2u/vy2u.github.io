if y'all can tell but this is the new
camera what I figured you start filming
and I knew g7x like it looks like more
like fresh and new and you're just like
yeah I'm your face movies like the
pimple popping Queen I'd like some
people just like love popping pimples I
feel like that's you you loved it when I
was younger my friend Corinne loved it I
feel like other people I know I love it
too
anyway um we didn't vlog yesterday even
though we had a very eventful day
because we didn't have a camera so I
don't know if you guys saw
well actually I'm like uploading them
right now because like I'm a little bit
behind but um when I went to Long Island
my camera was starting to get a little
weird because I knew there was some sand
in it from Aruba but not like a lot just
like a little like Emma had a lot from
Ireland falling in the sand with her
camera but mine only had like a little
from like the sand blowing in the wind
lesson learned from two cameras broken
from sand now I'm just not gonna bring
y'all to the beach anymore like I just
can't bring my camera I'll just have to
block my phone at the beach which sucks
but going through like two $700 cameras
like isn't where's that you don't have
to say but don't worry I have insurance
now um so this is like the millions
canon g7x mark to that I've gone but I'm
trying to be so careful with them now
but like if you bring them to the beach
simply just like they break so anyway oh
yeah and then in Long Island Mandy was
just like vlogging and then right after
she blogged my camera just completely
stops working like it just kept saying
lens they're like the lens like wouldn't
go into the camera I just stopped
working so and right as that happened I
was like okay I'm ordering any when I
ordered it immediately so I just picked
it up and here we are we can walk again
and yesterday me and Louisa
I wish me luck because it was the
biggest fail we left at 1:35 to go to
Fanueil Hall and we got there at 4:45
yep wait a minute
you know that was three hours oh yeah we
left at 2:35 okay I was like hold on
it took us two hours to get there and it
should have taken 18 minutes but I was
like on the phone with my bank oh and
this was also really fun I found out for
the past year and a half I've been
having fraudulent charges taken out of
my bank account so lesson learned pay
attention to your bank statements like
look at your bank activity because they
were just such small amounts that I
didn't notice and finally I was like
what are all these it was always $8 and
wait what was it it was 895 yeah it was
always I forgot it was always 895 like a
couple times a month or once a month
whatever it was always like different
names and like it was just basically
found out red flags
it was just like fraudulent charges that
I never like authorized it was really
bad tonight it's canceled my debit card
and this was all while we were driving
to Quincy instead of Phanuel home and
got really lost whatever and then we met
up with our friend that was abroad all
semester you guys know sama Jeremy's
been a might well good it was really fun
and then then what did we do we went to
the gym in the morning we started our
fitness journey I'm really sore
we were gonna go to the gym this morning
but then we woke up too late so now we
have a bunch of stuff to do and we're
gonna go to the gym tonight right now I
need to go get my car inspected not
really kind of it's like for insurance I
don't really know but it's like 25
minutes away and we got to go to the
locksmith
because we have one set of keys what
would be some needs a set of keys to and
I just picked up my camera and then the
gym and I gotta film a video I was just
over the video yesterday it just been a
crazy time so let's get it well we
duplicated one of our keys for Louisa we
have to go to a different place to do oh
my god my hands are so on why don't you
do that I'm going to go to another place
with another man
and I got my car inspected and I'm gonna
drive now somebody see guys this is my
old camera and this just like won't go
in yeah so r.i.p i don't know if you can
see me turn you this way
and if you can see that there's like
sand in that oh there you can kind of
see there's like sand in the lens
it's like focusing on the wrong thing
but like right there are you gonna try
it yeah you mean sweet potato and I make
you chicken you probably don't have to
it's gonna be like Salt City yeah no
it'll be good either way
oh and we have to eat these while we're
waiting because we're starved me and
Lisa made lunch actually Louisa made the
chicken pretty much and um chicken sweet
potato and salad and I just filled the
salad and got dressing all over my shirt
that's okay um we're trying to figure
out the people that we saw wet from
their TV and we couldn't figure out HBO
so we can't watch Sex in the City but I
think we can watch Netflix so we're
gonna keep on shaking they're really
good okay so they made you really making
good ones one night what do you put in
the hood I went into microwave and
they're really old and they were playing
yeah it's really good with that okay I
think it's back to normal
oh yay I was trying to film and it was
in time-lapse mode okay I have to trying
all those clothes for a trial and we're
gonna watch friends while we do it
so me and Lisa I've just been doing so
many things for a while now I did an
Instagram story haul I tried on some
outfits for some youtube whole try on
footage we've been like cleaning and
organizing you know just and now I'm
going to the gym and it's like 6:30 and
this is like way later than we typically
show but I was just missed I am believe
what are you looking for I think just
wear one of mine do you want like up
high like this or do you want like low
step into my closet
wait this I actually can't go tie up oh
this one goes love and oh yeah so we're
going late because we didn't go earlier
because you know we just slept late and
then did a lot of chilling yeah oh but I
was gonna say is I'm so happy that we
have each other to motivate each other
cuz if it was right now and I was here
by myself I'd be like ah ha ha and I
would just shower and eat food and like
play but we motivate each other and
yesterday Lisa was like you don't need
the brownie brittle at Trader Joe's and
I was like I need it she was like no you
don't and my good thing I did I really
didn't need it
I didn't I just thought that I needed
that you know what because I was like
I'm gonna end up eating this whole thing
and I feel like half a time when you're
hungry you're really just thirsty like
right now I think I'm hungry but I know
I'm dehydrated yeah literally I think
it's a real fact all my statistics are
real but yeah I think most of them when
you're hungry register start mooing oh
great little words you every time you go
to the bathroom you do 10 squats yeah I
want to do that so my butt has literally
flattened out I've noticed Estella I'm
going to the gym oh hey
I'm not even sweating anymore cuz I
stretched for a while I gave a new show
about it so I'm like ah no I feel like I
can film here since it's summer and not
like everyone is here it's so much
better in the store is that all melted
is it still good think we got smoothies
oh yeah I drink my name like once again
oh I thought it was there I threw it
away cuz I drink it off I always get the
green one it comes up with laughs like
