actually didn't vlog because at the
Bachelorette I left my camera at my
friend Claudia's house so that I just
got it this morning so is there like a
full deck
but I'm kind of behind on vlogs anyway
from Italy so yeah we're just gonna vlog
today today is Wednesday Wednesday yet
so he's Wednesday and it's around 10:45
already um but I got up at like 7:30 I
keep sitting my 1 for 10 I'll go to bed
at like midnight and then I set my alarm
for Li 10 in case I want to sleep a lot
and I really like shoot out of bed at
7:30 I keep getting about 7:30 I think a
part of it is being a head on like your
up time though also my kids kind of
brighten my room and I don't think I
need much more than like it's having a
half eight hours of sleep and I
literally have so much energy so yeah I
got up I did some video stuff and now
I'm just looking such a cleaning mood
like I don't know why I have so much
energy I think it's because I've been
working out more and it's like making my
metabolism quick and making me like I
don't know have more energy so I've been
cleaning a bunch I just cleaned our
whole table Clorox wipes oh yeah and
then I'm cleaning this and I don't know
I'm like this is kind of boring I'm just
like cleaning this morning but maybe
this can be a fun little montage of me
quitting everything because I'm doing
such a cleaning mood like I want to like
mop the floors
let's get it what is my first time
having french braids music French fitter
here guys I found a spot right on
Boylston and I'm so proud of myself and
I parallel parked today it was like a
little rough but I've been getting
better at it and now I gotta pay I have
the little pay on your phone app and you
know what everyone just parking about is
awful and it's kind of awful but not as
bad as it is so excited
this was like
like soaking lap but I like they feel
like out of my face
what she pushed that was probably tough
one bring in his first for me
so my
but oh boy we're five right now and I
just got these sweatpants and I love
because they were kind of like on sale
they were having like a 25% off on some
stuff and I have them in like gray like
light gray me and Abby and matching ones
and I haven't been able to find them but
um I just thought these things were
really cool and I was really sweaty and
my pants were soaking wet so I just
really like to change because we're
going to sweet Queen right now
we have like 20 minutes left on my meter
so we'll eat quick Wow
I don't
and oh it's bread oh thank you guys I
just thought I would tell you something
funny well actually right now if you're
wondering we saw these women we saw who
was that we're okay so basically we're
out front of Babcock right now which is
kind of giving me PTSD because freshman
year and I wrote I'd come here like a
million times a week to what lifts
weights at like 6:00 a.m. but um would
you say to turn the music off okay so we
just saw a boy a boy that was really
cute walk from down there all we passed
this way and we were just like I'm
balloon beat me too I wish I rolled down
the window and was like hey like are you
know he would definitely would have we
would have seen him on campus he is
definitely an incoming freshman
definitely over Crossley
just know 100% just say oh wait do you
know what camera that just reminded me
up we can look him up but that just
reminded me of Taylor told me this year
at one point in the spring she said that
she was running on a treadmill and the
cutest boy was next to her and he was
wearing like a Beulah Cross thing but we
were like no like he's not on the roster
like me no hablo cross guys and so maybe
I don't know but then I don't know how
that would be anybody who's really cute
oh but that has nothing to do with why I
started vlogging I wanted to vlog
because um I was looking at Mandy's
bitmoji on snapchat and it was nothing
like her and I'm like that's so bad and
he's a ghost
that's emoji me needs Jesus and my Jesus
Amy it's true it was really funny anyone
know I'm sorry I'm really bad
just hit a sister up hi Tay we just
started vlogging because Taylor we
thought maybe hottest boy walked by he
was wearing a red shirt and he was so
cute and he doesn't look like sure he no
it was just a red t-shirt and he looked
like the lacrosse type is all we gotta
say he was so cute he went into on
what's it called face what face yeah
should I go in yes you know because like
he's definitely an incoming freshman ok
I'm gonna start a boy crazy ok so
basically I don't tell you guys that
Taylor's with us because we're on our
way home from Seoul and she was like oh
my gosh my internship and I was like
don't worry sis I'll help you so we went
and scoops here is everything better now
no I have to go ship the snow ship what
a package but I can walk from your house
okay oh it's gonna be so good okay guys
we just finished I feel like we have to
play
she always thought speakeasy
because we watch my product PM turns my
girlfriend can be cleaned party get down
tomorrow
Maggie you kiss my naughty smell it was
so good I felt like crushed after like
it was like and I'd like to live in and
the hi old things like any late Indian
summer like member when I was like oh my
god
my husband is like no that's someone
that you played out about me like it - I
haven't heard that one
we're just gonna chill for an hour into
the next is the double even though we
wait like a marriage between
I need I think I want to go chill in my
car like glossy and very v so luckily we
have like an hour 45 minutes to kill
members will beg them in the next door
so Chestnut Hill won today and so I'm
sipping along because I need a kombucha
I feel like that will revive me and
between and keep me alive you trying to
figure out where it is
this stores so big I'll find you though
oh they say though the reason I just put
this out is because I learned the
importance of like having a bun and soul
because normally like I'll have a pony
but I always thought buttons would fall
out because I used to do so with my bun
would fall out but then today I was like
okay I just put like three hair ties in
and it stayed and it's so much better
because then your hair's not flipping
around
Oh kombucha I found some what's that one
food that one's chocolate baby though
I'm making another one - something good
all those nice a is back to my bun
stayed I'm just gonna keep putting on
like three or four hair ties because
there's so much better than my ponytail
I braids getting like soaking wet
all right back TMI big kombucha guys and
we're gonna get a Larabar to eat before
it Lisa Scott should we get to maybe we
should get to we'll get this one to the
cashew cookies one and then clam baby
juice yeah so guys we're back in my car
as you can tell but I'm really dumb and
I didn't lock my car so I just waltz
right in but then I tried to turn on my
car so we could blast em AC cuz it's
freaking hot out and we're sweating and
my kids are still inside of tools I
don't like anyone because they're about
to go in there anyway so we're sitting
here with the doors open so we don't
bake I'm so hot um and I got these two
Larabar cuz I'm like I feel like we're
supposed to eat in between I really just
feel like I'm just the real food right
now cuz I already ate a granola bar in a
banana but whatever but since we're
going to another class I think we do
yoga peanut butter chocolate chip
incacha cookie I got I think I'm just
gonna eat some of the cash you cook you
in
okay ready says it's peanut butter
cookie no it tastes so good you're gonna
freak out look it's really sweet and
yummy because it's made mostly out of
dates as dates peanuts salt and
chocolate chips good right do dance
there are dance I love the minute taste
they don't
[Laughter]
but that was stupid I feel like they
will night I'm not doing today like I
just went by so quick and I swear would
you do a double the second cos these
years already warmed up and I challenge
you to do a double if you've never done
it
actually it's like really expensive so
that's why I never did it because I
could not justify the fact of like going
to work out anything like to 70 bucks in
one day like it's but maybe just try it
once you feel like a fun fun time just
for funsies and see if you like it
because I swear the second class gets
easier and like you can do it because I
did my first one after not working out
for 10 days and eating only pasta bread
in Italy so and it nearly killed me like
the first talked about every I want you
to it was so good I know and she called
I wanted to show you I'm wearing my new
studio to be one day for the summer this
is why we say everywhere those
we just got so many loads this is not a
bear I've never tried they rounded up

left

like you can't get them and
possibly
you know so we just got fourteen
kombuchas some frozen salmon look as
loose and I made salmon like the first
litter like the first day that we moved
in and our public statements for three
weeks so if any of you have tips to make
salmon but make your whole entire
Department not calling salmon let us
know but so we got frozen zoo and just
be about make a difference and also can
you tell us can you bake salmon in the
oven because like why wouldn't you like
you can bake chicken in the oven or you
can put it on the stove like we do on
the stove because I get to pick her that
way whatevs
so maybe if we put on the oven it won't
either um oh and what I wanted to show
you is we got shrimp summer rolls
