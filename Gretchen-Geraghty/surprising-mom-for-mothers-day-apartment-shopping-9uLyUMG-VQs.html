I really want one
yeah that's good and Boston isn't the
best driving city but you definitely can

think do you want to know what kind so
Taylor's always had her cute little BMW
crossover or not oh we're sure yes I do
know for Mother's Day brunch so Taylor's
mom got a BMW x5 probably like in the
last couple of years and I've always
loved that car and I was actually one of
the first people to drive it I forgot my
license in Taylor was like why are you
letting her drive the car I don't know
when I was allowed but ever since then I
loved it but it's kind of big because it
has like the third row seats for like
seven or eight people or whatever so
that's kind of big for me so that I was
looking at the x3 and I really want the
white one with the tan inside sorry I
hate being discharged because we have to
grocery shop now but um so then I found
the exact when I wanted at this car
dealership I mean my mom my dad went and
I was so excited and then I go yeah we
we sold it and I was like big wet but
yeah we didn't want me to mail that so
you know Heidi's pissed I did so my dad
should have emailed in Irbil told me
they should have and so I almost ran in
the car at home so I'm so excited if any
of you would have like a 2017 or 2018
white bmw x3 with the tan inside and I
want to sell it to me DMV my mom goes my
mom goes on
find someone in the parking lot I tell
them that you'll be them for it Oh also

assistance in like 30 seconds so meet my
mom and Liz to go to get lunch and then
we leave and then like the car that Lucy
me had like in high school I guess it's
like Lucy's car our car that's like just
at home now you know it was right next
to a white BMW excavated with a tan
inside and I was like that lit was the
exact car that I wanted parked right
next to ours like while we were eating
lunch and I'm like that is literally a
sign that I'm supposed to get the car
but then it was in the dealership so
maybe I'm not supposed to all right keep
you updated okay with this mutation shop

the supermarket talking but I just
wanted to be clear I think I said
everything but yeah earlier I was like
oh my gosh I don't want to talk about
maybe getting in a car and I didn't talk
about it and it didn't happen it's okay
and what is meant to be is meant to be
no I just messed it up what is you don't
say I feel like everything happens for a
reason and like if it is meant to be
it'll be that's what I'm trying to say
whoa
I slept for three hours last night now I
can really tell I'm so dead but um yeah
I don't know I just thought it would be
really nice to have a car like for the
summer because like I'm gonna be
traveling so much I'm gonna be awesome
but then I can come home a bunch I can
go Turin whose meaning go to Cape Cod
tight I want to take a road trip across
the country we go corny like I hope it

get mad I figure we'll get judgmental
over like big decisions and stuff yeah
listen to God but yeah it's not my
parents buying you or - it's me it's on
me right now
oh so I get more than so it can be my
decision I don't know I think people are
gonna get Europe brought that like you
didn't want the one cuz it had black on
the inside but I just yeah there's
