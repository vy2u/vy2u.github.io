whatever saying you know but I'll just
say really quick on here when I just had
my interim story that by us staying here

saying I went in to clear this up cuz I
don't even know if I said it earlier you

it's like her parents time show that
they've literally had forever and they
had it when it was like the Ritz Carlton
owned it but then Trump bought it but
they already had it before he bought it
you know I'm saying and like how people
were quite unhappy about that whatever
so that they had it for that long and
like yeah that's being here doesn't mean
that we'd support it I just want you all
