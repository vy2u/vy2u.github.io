right now and what's weird is I went to
Italy on Twitter like to UM just because
there was like stuff I was doing like
I've been trying to be like very
productive and just like doing as much
as I can and there they like make sure I
don't have to do as much stuff the next
day like I was like putting away laundry
and like putting together like tax
documents like Who am I I don't know man
but yeah anyway today is Tuesday and I
have packed and today as much as I think
physically possible I was gonna wake up
at 10:00 so I could sleep more because I
know my body needs sleep because I'm
like literally physically I'm like
mentally drained and like exhausted but
did I just like woke up at 9:00 and was
like you know I'm gonna get like an hour
head start because I have a lot to do I
want to film a haul video right now um
and then Pat 12:00
I like a lunch date and then at 3:00 I
have a tax meeting and then at 4:30 I
have SoulCycle in the next six I have a
dinner and then at 7:30 I'm gonna go to
Pilates and I've done Pilates like once
in my life but um basically the reason
I'm like doing all these things like
yesterday like two little dates and I
was like struggling to try to get my
homework done in time for like my six
o'clock class or like 6:30 class um and
like I talked about it yesterday but I
didn't want to vlog with these people
and being so sketchy but like I mean
okay so you guys know I'm just ready
here at BU and I'm in like the pledge
class about the new pledge class that
just came in and so we're looking for
littles and so we meet with like a bunch
of girls in the pledge class below us
just to like hang out and talk to them
and see like what they're like just
getting to know them you know so I'm not
about to like without my camera when
we're like drinking tea or like at
Spieker and be like say hi you know what
I mean so that's why I'm not able to
vlog like yesterday and today as much
because these are like new freshmen
members of my sorority or summer
sophomores that like just came in and so
I'm not about to like throwing camera in
their face when I like don't even know
them that well and I'm just getting for
them and if you're really busy like me
like I said like running around like a
chicken with your head cut off and
you're like falling on a college budget
you're probably
how can I make some extra money when I'm
like so busy in class and stuff I think
I get that question all the time from
just fellow college students being like
how can I make money when I'm like so
busy with class so I've actually heard
of this website called swag bucks and
it's one of those websites where you can
just take surveys you can watch like
videos about products even like go
online shopping and you can earn extra
cash and gift cards and I know like gift
cards you can get or like Amazon gift
cards and when I checked it out myself I
know that you can get $5 like a five
dollar signing bonus when you click the
link in my description to sign up today
so yeah everyone should definitely check
it out link in my description and thank
you so much swag bucks for it sponsoring
this video
oh wait I don't know it's really funny
guys last night it was like twelve
fifteen and I was like I'm literally
starving oh and I didn't really eat
dinner because I just like ate at the
random his time just for daily ate lunch
I like 2:45 and then hey oh yeah I
showed that and then I went and I got
tea and then I got my nails done and
then I just like went to my class and
then I got back it was like 9:30 and
then I went I hung out with Abbi and
Lisa totally eleven and I was like wait
I'm starving so then I like was here for
a band finite like midnight I was like
I'm so hungry and I made myself so much
pasta like I was literally eating like
pasta and red sauce like pasta with
pesto at like 12 15 linked by myself
like at our kitchen table I was like Who
am I like how do I think I am any oh oh
but I wanted to show you because I
haven't made it in a while
but I've talked about it in vlogs like
earlier this spring is my overnight oats
there's so freaking good oh my gosh okay
I like doubled it because I was like you
know what I'm gonna be hungry this
morning
and I am I just like new you know
normally I will do like half of this but
so like this is a full cup of oats
instead of a half a cup but you know I'm
saying so this is a full cup of oats a
full cup of almond milk tablespoon or
two probably two tablespoons of peanut
butter I just like - some chia seeds in
there like I just
pour a little bit and then I just to you
some maple syrup to make you sweeter mix
it all up leave it in the fridge
overnight and you wake up with really
yummy oatmeal and it's almost like
better than like cooked oatmeal to me I
don't know why it just tastes so good
because I think they have all night to
like soak up all the yummy stuff so this
is what I'm gonna be talking forever I
just really through so much I could like
update you guys on right now but I'm
going to be showing you instead of
telling you today because I always do
that because I could talk to you guys
forever because I could talk forever but
yeah
it's so good my stomach
did you almond look like there's no
dairy or anything and I like definitely
no I'm like kinda lactose intolerant now
cuz whenever I have a bunch of dairy my
stomach just kills this is good for me
to eat like this in the morning into the
black eat the yogurt or something cuz
whenever I do that I notice my stomach
hurts
now I gotta like get changed and stuff
and start my day so I'm already now but
I ended up doing other stuff all morning
