a right good job so our story of how we
met is on the beach my sister wanted
like two days ago like two days ago now
we're like basically best friends now
we're best friends so it's because we're
water signs I'm not kidding it makes it
honestly makes sense it makes sort of
sense I told her that last night I said
Mina and I got along so well so quick
cuz we're water signs and I asked Cole
boy sign is needs the cancer which is a
water sign which is the same as Emma so
no wonder it's all meant to be that were
all supposed to be fragments of it it
really is so if your cancer is Scorpio
Pisces you're meant to be friends with
us in the DM yeah only we didn't tell
them how old you are yet we asked in the
last vlog how old do you think he is and
like okay truly if I just saw you I
would say you're like movie 19 that's
really crazy it's pretty big star
deceiving people
yeah where they're young but we look
when Emma are getting T I'm calling it
I don't have a response that we will see
what happens I feel like when I think
like 15 year old boys that like I don't
think of them looking like you but I'm
like pretty mature no you aren't yet we
feel like oh you guys yeah when I but
dear friends look like you that are like
not really like Emma like Emma looks
older than all of her friends like when
we go out like to the mall or something
that like I'm the adult of the group
like if there's a problem in the dad
yeah I yeah basically I'm I'm my 50 year
old dad yep so that's cool everyone in
15 so hopefully we'll be in the block
sorry if you're my age to know but if
you are 15
I mean he's single hope I just mudslide
in my face mmm-hmm so that's me let's
hope it's a virgin run or else we're
gonna be in both gonna die because he's
never even heard of what alcohol is oh
yeah I'm a good Christian boy read the
Bible every night amen friends - are you
Catholic

topic of all of the ball I'm so sorry I
just really so much
Manny felt left out shoes so this is
Goldeneye don't you look pretty this is
like good lighting
Oh dark aura
okay ready and Chris what's the Gretchen
scream
like that it's just like so hype in my
life sunset argue right now is so this
is my family I didn't think that the
girl that was sitting in front of us
thought that you were my mom like I
think we kind of look like probably just
cuz we both had blonde hair oh we went
down so quick
oh yeah this is Jenna I ate at iguana
Cantina before now they're just getting
some snacks so guys it's pretty late
right now it's like 11:30 and I just
felt like I had to vlog really quick
because Mandy and Kendall and Juliet
went out and usually they go out tonight
at the night at night I'm here in a row
but just to you know like me to put
their friends there's so many of their
friends in a robe right now because it's
fairly fit wear break so like all of
Long Island is here pretty much then
it's just been really fun to like
meeting everyone and just hang out and
Dan's like we went out of Saul's dance
the other night my salsa danced the
night away with my aunt Kris and like
this is so fun but anyway I've had like
a really tough night saying I don't hit
a wish gonna cry and it's funny because
I actually don't even know if I blog
this earlier because I meant to thought
my vlog came out I don't think I did but
Ireland posted a vlog today and it was
like reacting to God's plan like a music
video and me said at the end it just hit
him so hard like how grateful he was and
he was just like so emotional I couldn't
keep it in he was crying and I don't
know about you guys when I see boys cry
like I cry immediately and I'm the
biggest culprit I always do this a
reading comment before I watch the
videos I scroll down and I saw people
talk about how he cried in it and I was
like what so then I like watch the whole
thing and then at the end when he cried
like I was prepared because I read the
comments but I still like immediately
read his he started getting emotional I
cried the reason I'm even saying that I
want such a good kid and like afterwards
I was texting him and I was like oh my
god like I'm crying right now and he's a
quiet crying and I was like I'm watching
your video and I'm gonna kiss your guy
but whatever and then it just made me
like really sentimental earlier because
like honestly I'm so grateful for like
everything in my life that I've been
blessed and lucky to get and stuff that
I've worked for I'm just like super
grateful for all of it and I'm always
wanting guys to know that I think a lot
of you do though if you know me and like
I'm super grateful that I'm able to be
here but that just got me thinking like
the reason I didn't go out tonight is
because well like very sunburned and
feeling drained and I'm flying home
tomorrow so I need like get my stuff
together but also it's been like a
pretty hard night I've been like really
emotional and sad I'm really digging my
fingernails she likes me now so he won't
cry because I don't want to cry but this
has been a two-minute intro of me
telling you
I am actually in Aruba and I before I
just kind of explained it and like I've
been like dancing around saying actually
why I've been dancing around um the fact
that I'm not only here because my knees
were very break and I just randomly
decided to go like a week and a half
beforehand Mandie I mean had planned
going to her but forever and since like
September she was like please come with
me like I want you to come and I wanted
to come so bad but I knew that it was
recruitment weekend for my sorority it'd
be about feet and I'm going to be like
as vague and just like neutral as I'm
speaking about this because I do not
want to like offend anyone or get myself
in trouble at all but I'm just gonna say
that what this so pretty much we've had
recommend this weekend planned since
last recruitment when I went through
last year for our sorority and I have
been so excited to do this weekend of
recruitment like I literally just
couldn't wait every sometime went
through I was so freaking excited and
back in September I bought like all my
dresses for all the different days like
we knew colors we needed and I like
booked Oh tell him with all my friends
because how we do at FB it was like we
don't have shorty houses that we like
have rooms at the marriott coply that we
like that's how we do it from it there
so I knew that I would like stay at the
hotel because I did when I went through
and it just like makes it easier
whatever it doesn't matter basically
long story short I was so excited to do
it and then it turned out that I missed
some mandatory meetings that we just
needed to learn how to recruit and oh
it's completely my fault and I take like
full responsibility to that for that so
I don't want it this to be like me being
like mad or upset that I'll feel like I
totally take a little responsibility for
that so since I miss like these
important meetings um it was just like
something that I like didn't think
through and again like completely my
fault and I like will never stop beating
myself up for it because I was so
excited for this vegan to do a crewmen
don't cry okay um like I was so excited
and like oh wait actually like now I
just make sense because I think it was
one of my week in my life vlogs a couple
blogs ago I was saying I was like
literally the worst of my life in sober
I'm so sad because at that time it was
like such a big deal to me that I was
being told that something that I looked
forward to for an entire year and then I
planned for like I it just like it was
like the rug ripped out underneath me
you know like I was just informed that
like I wasn't able to participate in
recruitment because I wasn't prepared
well enough which I agree you know what
I mean like I probably wasn't prepared
well enough to able to recruit because I
missed those meetings and I wouldn't
know like the way that we do everything
so until they make sense at the same
time like even though it makes sense
than that
and like it's perfectly rational but I
wouldn't be part of recruitment that
doesn't mean that I'm not going to take
emotional about it so I was just so sad
for like two days and I was like
literally and I like it just like I feel
like I'm being so dramatic like I sound
dramatic but like I was just so like I
don't know I just kind of like keep it
there something you guys like look
forward to for so long and then I just
like didn't happen like whatever but
again like it's my fault I blame no one
else but myself and everyone and my
sorority that did go to meetings and did
prepare like I know it's like all
birthday and I've been like trying to
keep up with everyone this weekend all
with their there because I know they're
working their butts off and like I'm so
incredibly lucky to be part about feet
and like my sisters mean like the world
to me cuz I just made me really sad when
I was like informed that I couldn't do a
crewman on this side because I didn't
want anyone in my chapter to think that
I like didn't care because you know if
you're like in a sorority and you just
like didn't care at all I didn't go to
anything like you could probably get out
of recruitment you know I mean like if
you're just someone that like doesn't
show up whatever but like I didn't want
anyone that's to think about think about
me because like I care so much anyway so
this has been such a nice place I don't
even know where this is going
basically I just had like a really hard
night because I didn't really upset this
was like the last night of her
commanding tomorrow's good night but
luckily I'm so so lucky that my sorority
is allowing me to go back tomorrow
tomorrow night at midnight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
