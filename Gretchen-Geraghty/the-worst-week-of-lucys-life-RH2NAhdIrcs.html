London Airport and you might be
wondering Gretchen why are you losing
out on your plane right now well it's
because we missed our flight so now I'm
in a better state of mind
and I can talk about it but about 10-15
minutes ago I was like sobbing he was
screaming and angry and I wanted to just
yell and like punch someone I just
happen so we had believing it so awful
right now
so you see me and Aaron I don't see you
guys know him and Caroline you're like
the best people ever we love with them
so much for high school Caroline and
she's studying abroad in London so we
just had like the funnest Friday and
Saturday with them in London and then
today we have like a really good day
with them we went to the London Eye and
couldn't find Aaron because our phones
don't work in London to me literally
were both there but just couldn't meet
up with him because we didn't run into
each other so that was awful but the he
met at this Mexican restaurant in Oxford
Circus so after that we were like okay
we'll go shopping a bit around Oxford
Circus T's where like all the shopping
is and then after that we were gonna go
to the winter wonderland in Hyde Park
and we're like oh my gosh perfect like
this is my hotel that we stayed at was
here the Sheridan by the way and Park
Lane and it was right next to Hyde Park
and we had left our bags there during
the day all we have is like these big
huge backpacks that we filled with
things because we were only in London
for two days so we were like okay
perfect we'll go to and you Wonderland
it'll be great we'll leave go grab our
bags hop on the tube and then get to
Gatwick flew to London City Airport but
then we had gone our flights out of
Gatwick like previously so we're like
okay if we leave one's your Wonderland
by like 6:45 that gives us way way too
much time to even like think about being
late because we're like our flight left
at 9:35 and then we just knew that we
should be at the airport by like 8:00
that like perfect like an hour 35
minutes early right so Kent lines like
it'll take you guys 45 minutes to get
from London to Gatwick um you could
leave by like 7:15 but maybe just like
leave by 7:00 really Kate great so if we
leave winter wonderland by like 6:45 or
hotels like right next to it we grab our
bags we go we get on the train by like
7:00 good to go get there like 7:45
things don't work out as planned okay
our hotel was not as close to Hyde Park
as we thought it was it was a 10-minute
walk then we get our bags and we're
trying to like figure out where the tube
is and we really screwed up and that's
really where this all went wrong
because Lucy me walked around for a half
an hour so lost like walking in circles
just trying to find the tube station
that we were supposed to get on to get
to Station Victoria which gets you on
the Gatwick Express which brings you to
Gatwick Airport so basically it's like
7:40 and we're freaking out and we're
like still not on a train to get to
Victoria to get to Gatwick Airport and
we didn't realize that Victoria was not
even that far and we could have walked
to Victoria but we didn't know this
right so finally we end up going back to
the Sheraton back to square one so we
can have Wi-Fi and try to figure things
out because when we're running around
like we don't have service Lucy's phone
got stolen you guys know that so we only
have mine we're running around like
chickens with their head cut off and we
talked to this guy and he's like go to
Green Park and it's only one stop to
Victorious we could've walked Victoria
like I said get to Victoria get on the
Gatwick Express whatever so we go to
Green Park get to Victoria get off get
so lost in Victoria and really asking
random people where we go we can't
really get with Express we asked this
random guy and he's like you're like on
the wrong level you're still underground
you need to go above ground to the
actual train station get a ticket there
get off get with these friends to go to
Gatwick really cool you probably don't
even care this is such a long story just
like click out of this video right now
okay so then we go upstairs get the
tickets go to gap it wasn't even called
to Gatwick Express though it was just
like a train that stopped at Gatwick a
national line
I don't know so then we go and then our
like tickets don't work and he's like
you're on the wrong platform but it said
platform 13 but then we had to go to
platform 16 and then we wait and that
train for like 10 minutes before it even
leaves leaves at 8:17 at this point it's
so late and we're like gosh dang and
we're supposed to be at the airport so
it's 817 our train leaves we get to
Gatwick at what time would you say
8:45 mind you I just ran out of memory
except this day is going train lift and
then 35 right so we get there like 8:45
and we're like we still have a chance
right okay
backpedal a little bit during the day
Lucy me were smart and we were like
we'll check in during the day on our
phone so that it'll like save time right
we try to check in on my phone doesn't
work and it's like you can't check in on
your phone with Yuling for like
international flights if he doesn't like
you like you have to check in at the
airport oh yeah for like international
flights if you don't have a European
passport and we have US passports
obviously I said okay great awesome cool
and then when we tried coming here
checking in at the airport was just
horrible we waited like half an hour and
then they were like you don't have seeds
you guys know if you watch a story
basically we bought two tickets travel
here and we're buying two tickets to
travel back okay so it's like a 45 we
were like running to the viewing like
check-in we get there and there's two
people there and I'm like hi like our
flight to Paris leaves at nine thirty
five like we have to check in like right
now and mine it was like empty like no
one there and they were like oh my gosh
like we don't work for feeling like the
woman here just left and I was like what
do you mean she just left and they're
like like that I mean the checking
clothes like she left and we're like no
no no no no like we got again it's like
right so then it also mind you we have
no backs like we just have our personal
items so like we literally could have
gone to security got to the cake on the
plane like it would have taken ten
minutes it would have taken ten minutes
no five because no one was there no one
would go through security right whatever
so that you have to go talk to customer
service we go it's like Gatwick customer
service and she's like sorry like
check-ins closed which I understand it
they closed check-in but I'm like this
is why we tried to check in during the
day and me cutting because we had
American passports she's like that's
just like a policy and I'm like no like
no like we literally were here two
minutes after so we got to the viewing
check-in at 8:52 we were freaking two
minutes late guys and she left at 8:50
because that was 45 minutes before the
plane took off and that's like their
policy put like no oh my god
oh so upset so I was like why go after
and like just so what's sad like
whatever it's gonna work out
I'm just quickly trying to think of like
the positives but I was just so mad at
that lady I was like no like get us
through security and then we can get on
the plane like it's not even boarding
yet and I also felt Lucy like at 8:52 we
would have had 13 minutes to get through
security before that even started
boarding and then they usually stop
boarding 15 minutes before it leaves
so we could've gone to the gate by like
9 20 and we still could have gotten on
the plane that's that's what makes me
that if we had had our boarding passes
we would have gone through security and
gone on the plane but it's only because
we didn't ever boarding passes because
we couldn't get them during today
whatever I'm like completing a lot right
now because obviously very heated like
this is everything it just happened but
this song is a good song and it's gonna
be okay
and Lucy me I found cafe Nero I mean
like a comfy lover ciao ciao ciao yep
couch this could be way worse but now
the only little issue is we bought a new
flight we get in tomorrow morning our
flight leaves here at 7:40 I really hope
we don't fall asleep and sleep there
that too like we fell asleep in and
slept through my first ticket to come
here until I did well it is just like
bad luck so I get to Charles de Gaulle
at 10:00 and my flight that goes back to
America that goes to Boston leaves at
11:35 so that gives me like it's just
enough time to go through customs go
through security hopefully get my
boarding pass cross your fingers ladies
and gentlemen and Lucy's gonna have to
go straight to her internship and now
we're not sleeping over tonight and in
Paris and Lucy's apartment like we were
supposed to do we're gonna like shale
and London Airport all night long
but I'm kind of excited because then
that means it's just like interrupted
Lucy Gretchen time and we get to watch
movies and hang out so I like it's like
for responding Newport's your twin
sister to love you anyhow I think that
wraps it up that's pretty much
everything I want to say basically get
like I'm a little unimpressed with your
customer service because we easily could
have gone through security and gone on
the flight and like I understand you
good policies like the flightcheck and
was closed like I don't care put on my
boarding pass I can still get on the
plane it's not gonna leave for a half an
hour you know I mean it's like
just annoying because we were literally
two minutes late or like it's fine we
tried our best we should have left
earlier but like I thought that we left
so much of our time but we did it
because we kept getting lost and we're
just so confused and like coming back
from London City Airport to our hotel
was so easy like we figured it out so
quick but whatever it's gonna be okay
right now gonna be okay we're at cafe
narrow we're going to get food oh yeah
just another little caveat in our
situation is we have obviously American
I know I'm gonna do it we have American
chargers and we had to go buy good water
thank you Jesus nice cushy hopefully we
get some sleep tonight the airport in
fine hotel because I was like knowing
that we'll find a hotel in sleeper our
flight in the morning so yeah but I got
a Nero who's he just got us is it like a
falafel sweet potato wraps cranberries
spinach it's really good we can of
course we got a vegan soup too good
stuff I am now back in Boston in my room
as you can tell it is actually Monday
November 27th in the last footage we're
just watching was obviously like late
night Saturday the 25th we thought that
when I was filming that when we just
missed that one flight and had to
reschedule for the flight in the morning
was the lowest of the low and boy were
we wrong things got really really bad
and took a turn for the worst on Sunday
and I literally could not blog because
Lucy and me were in just such bad shape
we were so upset like that was the worst
morning night combination of two days of
my whole life
it was so bad so I'm just gonna try to
tell you guys it really quick about it
yeah I don't even know how I'm back in
Boston right now I literally don't know
so quick recap just so you guys are
aware when Lucy was an Amsterdam I think
it was two weeks ago now she got mugged
I don't know if I talked about this but
Lucy was mugged and she got her wallet
grabbed out of her purse which I don't
know I think just take her off first but
he took the whole lot out of her purse
which had all her credit cards debit
cards cash every ID every form of ID bu
ID driver's license passport which was
the biggest issue everything he also
grabbed her ray-bans but not the purse
itself so I don't know she still had her
phone back then so yes but then an
answer
we just tries to leave Amsterdam she
doesn't have a passport so she can't go
back to Paris right so she's like
missing class missing or an internship
so she's stuck in Amsterdam for four
extra days going to the American Embassy
trying to get an emergency passport
that's what they're called when your
passport is stolen our loss and you need
to travel to a different country like
immediately so just go back for school
right so she pays like hundreds of
dollars to get her emergency passport
goes back to Paris right but at this
point that's only form of ID she also
had no form of like payment or money at
that point so her boyfriend that she was
dating with daraa I don't know if you
guys know about Dhara but like it's her
boyfriend and he is studying in
Amsterdam the three goes to college so
he was luckily there's pay for like
everything and then she had a pay him
back because now she has like a debit
card again and my parents inter she's
been going through so many different
cards abroad she's lost so many anyway
it's just been a really rough time for
Lucie abroad okay so she gets back to
Paris and mind you and she's in
amsterdam getting her room you see
passports she's telling them hey my twin
sisters coming to visit me next week
we're going to London
will this emergency passport be good for
that and they're like yeah you're
totally fine like it's valid for a year
and she even looked up online it says
valid for a year but then on the
emergency passport itself it said it
expired three months exactly from the
day that she got it in Amsterdam
okay so then Lucy me go to London you
guys know that's a whole mess in itself
because Friday morning we had train
tickets those were very expensive and we
missed our train
so we're freaking out we're like we
gotta go to London we have a dinner
reservations tonight we have friends
that were hanging out with there we have
a hotel booked that we got to go right
so we get tickets for a flight I know I
already talked about this but I'm just
giving you a quick recap we get tickets
for a flight that leave at like 11:00
barely make it on the half-light get to
London okay so then we got tickets way
long ago a couple weeks before to go
from London and back to Paris
Saturday night and then I was leaving
from Paris to come back to Boston Sunday
morning you guys saw in the clip stirs
now that we missed the flight Saturday
night to go back to Paris so let me read
book tickets for 7:40 in the morning
Lucy me did not sleep at all in Saturday
we stayed up all night long and then
Sunday morning around literally 5:30
6:00 we go check in for our second
Vueling flight it's feeling by the way
and we check in we get our tickets
we go through security we go to the gate
and this is where everything goes
horrible give them our boarding passes
our passports Lucy only has her
emergency passport I have my real one
the emergency passport looks just like a
real one but it's like thinner it's more
like paper because they just make it
like that day essentially the guy at the
gate starts like calling up like
supervisors or something and we're like
oh we're used to this like when you
travel with an emergency passport it's
more tricky because it's not the same as
like a real passport so he's like on the
phone it's like his supervisor or
manager whatever it is and he's like you
can't fly like your emergency passport
expires before three months and it's
like a European rule that when you fly
internationally you must have a passport
that is valid for three months after the
departure date in different countries
they have different rules I remember in
Tanzania like in Africa I had to be
valid for six months after so I had to
get a new passport before I came out
coming Jarrah whatever
and we're like no dude look we
understand we like we knew that was the
rule but she just got this emergency
passport like legit a week ago and like
they told her it would be valid for a
year and the expiration date was like
three months from when she first got it
in Amsterdam but he was like no it
expires like not three months from like
this date like she can't fly so we're
like losing it at this point like
freaking out we haven't slept in a full
day we didn't sleep the night before so
we're like sobbing it's like literally
the worst thing ever like the people at
the gate felt really bad for us too but
you know they were just doing their jobs
and Lucy and me were like balling like
on the phone with my dad which by the
way oh I forgot to mention this so
unless he gets back to Paris from
Amsterdam the first time the day before
I get there she's in a restaurant with
our friend Julia who's visiting her and
she's bringing this coat that has like
open pockets it's from rainy novel like
a great trench coat I wore like clothes
I was there and she had her phone in it
and someone just walked by in the
restaurant and grabbed her phone out of
her pocket and ran out the restaurant
like she literally got pickpocketed
so Lucy also doesn't have a cell phone
oh and right before we went to London
the day that I got there we went out
that night and I broke her wrist so Lucy
is a phoneless all forms of ID list has
a broken wrist is like really struggling
right okay so back to we're at the gate
sobbing total mess and they're like oh
you have your student visa like if you
just had your student visa you could
show us then he could fly and she's like
I told you like I got mugs like
everything was stolen we're like going
on Lucy's laptop at the gate looking
through iCloud trying to find like
pictures of anything we can show them to
like prove that she's like a
student in Paris like studying abroad
and they said that's all they needed so
we end up finding a picture of her
student visa which they said that she
needed and she could fly and they were
like no doesn't work we find her grades
from all of her classes abroad in Paris
they also said they needed like the
police report when all of her stuff was
stolen in Amsterdam and she couldn't
find the police report but she found a
receipt from the police report and
they're like sorry no and she literally
gave them every tour of documentation
that she could she gave them her address
in Paris I think that building she lives
in like everything and they just like
weren't having it and it was just a
horrible guys it was so bad we're like
we had been at this Airport for like 12
hours now like we need to get out of
here Lucy needs to go to her internship
she was supposed to go to her internship
during the day on Sunday because she
missed so many days of her internship
from being stuck in Amsterdam I'm not
able to leave the country and then from
when I broke her wrist we were like
doctors all day like it's just been such
a hard time right so they're like we
really can't let you on the flight and
one of the guys that worked at the
airport felt really bad he saw it was
going on and he was like okay like call
the Embassy of the US Embassy in London
right now try to get them to like fax us
something that a documentation that you
can like travel and of course the
embassy is closed on Sundays so finally
we just come to the conclusion like
we're not getting on the flight and that
was like the hardest realization because
you just waited in the airport for like
12 hours to get on that flight and we're
like sobbing and walking through the
airport the next thing we have to do is
contact the US Embassy in London and try
to figure this whole thing out because
Lucy literally is not allowed to leave
the country so my phone since it's an
American phone I had no service in
London or Paris the entire time I was
there and my phone only worked on Wi-Fi
but when your phone works on Wi-Fi you
can FaceTime you can iMessage but you
can't like call like have like a normal
cellular service like call and we're
like cool we can't even call the Embassy
so we find a payphone but Lucy only has
euros so we have to go all the way
around to like currency exchange
exchange euros for some pounds and woman
can't understand why we just need any
coins and we're like we try and use a
payphone but crying I go back to the
payphone
payphone isn't working he's like
throwing in like a million pounds like I
don't even know it was just like the
lowest of the low and it was just so
upsetting
finally like a woman at a customer
service as near as in the airport like
felt bad
her phone was he calls the embassy and
they're like they like made her
appointment for like 8:15 a.m. Monday
the next day because they were closed on
Sunday but like even though they're
closed you could still call someone I
don't know so then she became too I stay
with Lucy in London who is hurt her
wrist is broken she can't do that much
on her own she doesn't have a cellphone
she has one debit card that is it like
only an emergency passport no other form
of ID like obviously I wanted to stay
with Lucy I was like I am NOT leaving
you here like I could have gotten on
that first flight like I got checked in
and could go get on the plane and
everything that I was not about to leave
Lucy and I was like obviously I'll stay
with Lucy in London to get this whole
thing sorted out so she can go back to
Paris but this Friday so it's money now
this Friday I have my final business
presentation in core where we pretty
much present our whole business plan
that we turn in last Tuesday like this
is one of the most important academic
weeks of my life like core is so
important you need quarter graduate it's
like so academically like rigorous
interests in 10 so I was like I need to
go back to Boston like my team cannot me
without me I need to be involved in this
like this is just the worst timing ever
and in mind you when we miss that flight
from London back to Paris I was supposed
to get on the 11:35 flight from Paris
back to Boston but I missed that one
also because I couldn't get on the 7:40
flight from London to Paris so we're
like missing a flights left and right
and finally Lucy was like Russian like
you need to go back to Boston like
course so important you need
it's like prioritize your academics
she's like I'll be fine like I will go
to the embassy at 8:15 in the morning
they'll get me a new emergency passport
and I'll fly I'll book a flight right
then and there back to Paris and I'll
fly back to Paris today Monday and it
was like a hard-ass decision I literally
cried the whole flight home from London
to Boston yesterday because I was like I
literally have just left Lizzie stranded
it's my fault her wrist is broken she
doesn't have a phone she has no II like
call nuber contact anyone of us unless
she's on her computer I'm like Wi-Fi and
like it was just like the hardest
situation and I was like Lucy I cannot
believe this is happening like
everything just kept going wrong you
know and I think I haven't had that big
of challenges in life but that was
definitely one of them being stuck in
London and like your twin sister is
literally not allowed
and so I didn't have a flight back to
Boston but I needed to come back so then
write that in there when we finally
figured out after talking for like an
hour that like she was gonna stay in
London alone and figure this out by
herself like if she's 20 she's in the
dough like I knew she could do it but I
just didn't want to leave her you know
and she was like you need to go back to
Boston I was like okay I need to go so I
wanted my phone found the quickest
flight from London straight back to
Boston I found a direct flight thank
goodness it would took like seven half
hours it was pretty quick quick meaning
like there wasn't like lay overs and
stuff and it was so expensive because I
bought it like two hours before and then
there was like issues because for like
international flights like that they
need your passport on record like 72
hours prior to the flight but I bought
the ticket like two hours before the
flight left you know so I was like no no
no not today slide and like luckily I
did and I flew Norwegian Air Shuttle
back to Boston it was like this massive
plane and they like fed us good food it
was like a really good experience they
felt really bad about everything that
happened in the morning and oh wait
another thing I forgot to mention this
is like the log is most confusing thing
ever you probably don't care I'm sorry
I'm just explaining hard times to you so
after we're like high on phone at the
Embassy and my dad and we're like still
stuck like literally like in like the
gate section like through security and
everything we're like okay well now Lucy
I ended up getting hotel at the airport
yeah Sunday night she's a-doin like
Sunday afternoon Sunday night and then I
need to go check in for my Norwegian Air
Shuttle flight back to Boston and so we
go to security try to go back out the
other way and they're like no you can't
once you've already come through
security you can't walk out the other
way like you have to go to customer
service and has someone like escort you
we thought the customer service was just
gonna escort us through security but no
we went through like a million like
tunnels and back doors and elevators and
stuff and we're like where are we going
and we end up at like UK border customs
like where people that are flying into
the UK from other countries like go
through like customs and the line was
like a million miles long and the guy
that was escorting us I was like no no
no sir like we don't have to go through
your we were in the UK like we just need
to go back to where health checking
booths are and he was like no like you
already went through security and you
were out you're gay and since you missed
your flight like you have to go through
customs right now and we're like are you
kidding me and we wait in the lines like
an hour with it's like Airport agent
that's like taking us through and then
we have to explain our story
got the customs agent like everything I
just told you and he took it forever and
you could not understand it and we had
to show him proofs of like my flight
going back to Boston and I defined the
flight that I booked for Lucy coming
from Paris back to Boston on or New York
whatever it is on like December 22nd
when we come home and I like couldn't
find the fly and like it was biggest
mess of our whole life but so anyway I
did so I end up getting out of flight
Sunday afternoon I left it was all this
smells really weird I left London at
4:00 p.m. but I got into Boston at 6:30
p.m. because of like the five hour time
difference so because the flight was
like seven and a half hours so I get
back last night Sunday night and I'm
like dad like so tired like slept for
like 13 hours whatever but because I
literally didn't sleep at this point for
like 35 hours it was like something
insane like I just didn't sleep for two
days but okay update so called busy on
facebook Messenger this morning cuz she
still has an M phone and she did go to
the embassy I 8:00 a.m. they did give
her a new emergency passport and as we
speak she is on a flight from London
back to Paris thank you God for making
this one thing run smoothly and she
cannot resume her internship if they
don't hate her or like fire her because
she's been to like zero days of it but I
just feel so bad for this girl guys like
Lucy has B worst luck ever she did
everything she could she did everything
in her power she did everything right
she got all these emergency passports
that everything she could but it's not
her fault when like her wallet gets
stolen with like her whole life in it
and then her phone gets pickpocketed you
know what I mean so I guess just sorry
this is really long one thing you can
learn from this is like I guess things
can always be worse like we're like
lying in the airport ground swapping our
eyes out at like 7:45 in the morning
obviously things to be so worse like we
were so extremely fortunate that we were
able to like figure it all out and she
was able to go to the embassy and that
we had enough money to buy like eight
flights that we kept missing you know
what I mean like obviously not ideal but
it could've been so much worse so yeah
that's just like the hell that we've
been through in the past couple of days
Lucy I love you when you watch this and
like I know things are gonna turn around
for you because I know right now it's
really rough with like nothing but your
wrist will heal in like four to five
weeks he said your phone is on the way
mommy and daddy ship do anyone um you're
gonna finish out your internship strong
and
they will I'm sure be understanding of
everything that you've been through and
yet for all of you guys out there with
hard times like I've never had anything
is even as hard as that which isn't even
that horrible happened to me in my whole
life and Lucy's like this is a normal
day for me like things always go wrong
so if you feel like you have like really
bad luck and things always go wrong like
I guess that happens to Lucy too and I'm
like pretty much like a lucky person
like never missed a flight before that
whole mess yeah I just wanna let you
guys know that if there's a will there's
a way there's always a way to like
figure things out like you're gonna like
get home eventually you know just
sometimes it takes a couple days when
you're stuck in a country and the
embassy won't let you out you know II
mean but anyway so I think that is a
whole story right now it is 3:23 on
Monday and I'm going to my core meeting
right now we have to practice for our
presentation on Friday which is like the
whole reason I had to come home
yesterday so yeah that is our story and
pretty much the worst week to week so
Lucy's life like everything's being went
wrong for that girl but just know I love
you so much Lou and we're all here for
you and because we're watching let's go
comment like nice comments on our
Instagram okay because she just needs
some support in life right now
