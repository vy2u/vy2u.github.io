we like Oh Elsa Maggie had to get
headphones because you'll see in her box
she left her ear buds back in our hotel
but our tour guide at Tyson is
to her tgd and she was gonna just buy
another pair of ear pods here so she'd
give it to the neighbors so about did
you got normal like a flat bones and
then we just got caprese panini exhibit
and I wanted to show you the reason
because I've learned my love for like
they call them like marmalade croissants
here I just croissants with like jelly
on the inside and it's so good I don't
know I've never thought of that because
like I don't know you have plain
croissants and you like eat them like
jelly but they're so good
yeah we love customs okay trying to
chill out and then I realize like a
storyteller Adak he said making
storytime just explaining the situation
and I was like that's a good idea so I'm
not gonna talk about it now but I don't
know if the towards you at the same time
so you can make just go watch that but
if you're gonna happen to go watch that
because it was boring and just chill in
the relay
and we're gonna get food I'm sure I've
said I saw some video children I don't
know Aled in like ten days gives me
better yerevan said I really have this
for no I guess you see but that's like
that's a real salad that's like tomato
basil and I Maggie and I are in a giddy
mood she just did the funniest little
turkey dance moves like that and then I
took it chicken wing of it and posted on
