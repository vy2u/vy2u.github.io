this is my bus to Boston and then I fly
out of Austin later to LAX which seems
like dumb but I'm really happy that I
chose that because really the reason I

Boston for like an hour so I can give my
eyelashes pills

and it's like take with food and I'm
like oh it'll be fine if I don't my
stomach hurts so bad for like two hours
