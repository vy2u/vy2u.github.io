right now and we have a little helper
with us
Teddy loves car rides Teddy loves
errands Teddy loves people
Teddy loves snow Teddy loves life I've
been thinking too much
Oh
I'm falling my time am i right yeah yeah
Oh
okay guys we've been waiting in line
we've been waiting in line at the bank
forever I thought it would be easier to
do the poll three thin like this deposit
my checks this is so fun wow I've never
done this before work so we are
literally so adult so guys Lucy me I
just got back from running errands of
Teddy it was so fun I love meeting the
car with him really always get back I
think there's no need to I'm so excited
so I got a bunch of bathing suits from
Albion fit and I know you guys use a
code Gretchen 15 you'll get 15% off of
their whole website and I'm so excited
because I've been wanting to try their
bathing suits for a while now and you
guys know I'm going to LA and like a
week and I'm so excited because it's
nice and warm there so I can wear it but
it should be swimsuit from the website
this is probably my favorite and don't
worry I will try these along for you
guys you can see they look like it's
getting a little dark right now though I
don't know if you can tell because it's
like almost 4 p.m. I handled or get gets
in the winter here but I can just turn
on my studio light oh my gosh don't look
at my roommate's time I see I can just
turn on my studio lights you guys can
like actually see what the bathing suits
look like on right here how about we
just put you down yeah
Oh ready this is nice and intimate and
cozy the first bathing suit bottoms I
got are just these vertical striped ones
and these I just think are so cool I'm
so excited to have how many said ones
because I don't have like any
high-waisted ones and I love their
vertical stripes because I know they'll
be like super slimming and then I got
this orange top I really like the cut of
it how it goes into like a deep V I like
the material - it's kind of like this
ribbed material and I actually think you
can like mix and match it with like this
one maybe these are supposed to go
together
I like that their bathing suits they all
kind of like Courtney and I got this
orange top it was like off the shoulder
like this and roughly and then they just
have these little straps at the top but
I think these are very like versatile
because you can pull these straps down
like this and then it's just off the
shoulder or you can just put this like
around here and then it doesn't even
have to be off the shoulder it can just
be like alright your boobs if you're
like tanning or something so I love like
how versatile this is probably got these
orange bottoms to go with so it just
matches like the other two orange tops
perfectly then this print I also the
is so cute it's like this light blue
with flowers like a floral print this
would be so good I'm like a tropical
beach and this is also high waisted and
I got the same style top is that orange
one but in the blue like floral print
and in the last meeting said I got I'm
actually so excited so I like haven't
really worn one pieces all that much I
usually just wear it bikinis so I'm so
excited to have a one-piece to try out
everything this one is so cute and looks
like it'll be like so flattering on it
don't forget if you use the code graph
215 you'll get 15% off of all of their
swimsuits and I'm really hoping trying
them on helped you guys out for like
size reference oh by the way I got a
small and everything I would say it fits
me like perfect I would say normally on
between like small or medium but in some
suits like I always get a small because
I don't want my some shoes to be like
baggy yeah going to the gym when I'm
home I fix me more productive and like I
know there's gonna be something I'm
gonna do every day so it makes me like
plan my days out more instead of like
laying in bed all day and doing nothing
so life hack just have some consistency
in your schedule and you'll be more
productive that's probably our life had
probably ever knows that but like I need
to make myself do that the only talk for
a second I'm at a stoplight I don't have
all good Drive because I know that's not
safe
the girls really got him on my way home
now I'm really excited to get some salad
that's all white wine so Lucy and me are
headed to the man we're just gonna do
some exploring and shopping and such and
later to him I have something really fun
we might cut off with these cast Wow I
could almost pull it off I get literally
almost just came off earlier in but
is that so much like muscle my alarm has
lost like you can like like I wait 90
last night you can tell oh you're hurt
so bad they're so sensitive I've been
scared to like eat and drink all day I
haven't really eating or drinking that
much because it hurts so bad
and I'm with my retainers for the first
time in forever so it's probably like
wow I thought I was gonna be a big
dramatic like sawing it off at all you
did was pull it off wait hold it up my
head feels so heavy oh my god it wasn't
on tight enough then no it's because my
muscles got so small that my wrist could
like my wrist got so skinny that I could
just slide out so update we are back
from the malls that I didn't vlog at the
mall I don't even think I bought at the
mall but we did go for a hot side oh
yeah and then you saw Lucy pull off her
cast once we got back and she told me
that she just felt like really nauseous
because I think it like really hurt her
wrist but anyway I'm going in to go to
gym now because I'm going crazy like
sitting around and update these sneakers
I got you guys remember me shoving these
Brooks I got um for my video I did with
dick so I actually really really like
them for running so yeah I really
enjoyed that I have Brooke you do I had
saw Saucony sake knees and they were too
big on me so these come back from the
gym nice and sweaty I'm gonna shower now
and then find some dinner
Lucy was just in her my coop and little
ball watching daredevil if you guys seen

flash foundation because I filmed a
video before so everyone is public why

mom it's literally like a can and it's
like you like spray it on your face but
I want to ask you guys are you supposed
to spray it on to like your brush but
your Beautyblender tree supposed to

with other beautiful
so basically we're not meant to be doing
scissors because I'm sad and I'm loving
so there's no win I like those I didn't
vote you at the mall I haven't been in a
Lululemon sort and so on I normally I
just order online I feel like you know
every time I walk by it like this you
keep walking when our element I thought
I only like the original lines but I
like the new ones the new ones are so
soft those runs Maggie gets bula did you
try any lines I just think they have to
run so big
cuz the four is like fit me but they're
kind of loose you know and these are it
to look I feel like they just fit better
you know you gotta have the original
ones but Maggie loves these ones so I
feel like I need them and this is the
free to be top at the long when did you
try it on them yeah I really like you
too
I would wear this just like like the
whole thing
that is what the back looks like I have
the normal free to be from below and
it's not like too stretchy like this
like it's like the first thing I ever
got from here so I think they must have
changed it I like so tiny like hurts me
