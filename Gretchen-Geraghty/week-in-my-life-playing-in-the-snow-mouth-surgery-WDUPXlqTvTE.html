tell by how bright the lighting is it is
so bright like iron when I was younger

the snow is so bright and everyone's
making fun of me like I literally cannot

it's sunny I literally don't even wear
sunglasses cuz I'm weird and I really
don't really wear them but in this snow
I need them who else has a friend /
sibling that takes 80 hours to get ready
to play this dog Teddy's writing he
wants to go and you're taking too long
I know I know it'll just be three more
years yeah me too I'm sweating Oh teddy
there's soap look at that face - good
morning guys it is actually already
Saturday January 6 yesterday was Friday
but I didn't foggy at all because I was
in so much pain I'm not gonna show you
because it's really gross but basically
oh sorry I saw the music playing
long story short because I don't abort
you do you guys remember this summer I
was in New York City and I cracked a
tooth that I had a filling in because I
got a root canal when I was 11 and I had
to like emergency get it pulled out by
this by this like oral surgeon dude in
York City that I never been to before it
was like not even to sound dramatic it
was a highly a traumatic because um the
day that he pulled it out I didn't even
know he was gonna pull it out and so
none of my roommates were home to like
take care of me and I was in so much
pain I just want to be home with like my
mom and my dad and they weren't there so
I was just like whatever
basically that made me like so scared of
anything with my mouth because it was
just like so painful and now I just hate
when things are wrong with like my teeth
and I know I have to be like cut open or
novocaine or whatever because I just
like tooth pain is just the worst pain
okay whatever since I was missing a
tooth in the back for a while there was
a couple options
it was bridge which is like basically
for
with insurance but just like not a good
solution for someone so young my oral
surgeon was saying because they take the
two teeth around it and they have to
like shave those down and I'd really
like to crowns on those two teeth and
like a fake tooth in the middle but he
said he like wouldn't recommend it even
though it is like basically for you so
that sucks because what I ended up
getting is an implant and those are so
expensive because I also had to get a
sinus graft which was horrible so I
think we're looking at like $7,000 even
though we have insurance and everything
we have like good dental insurance
whatever like my dad works for the state
this is a giving back Bristol but yeah
basically it's just still so expensive
because insurance just covers bridges
and like I could have gotten dentures
but he was like you're 20 you're not
getting dentures for that one tooth so
you get an implant which is where they
take this big huge grow wish I had to
picture the x-ray because he's like this
is pretty much like one of the biggest
ones that our outlook on the market but
because I had so little bone that grew
back after they pulled out that tooth
he's like you wanted to use a big ones
that it would be like more stable and
basically my sinuses dip really low like
really close to the roots of my teeth
especially where that ones who thought
the sinuses dip so low so he's like you
have like 4 millimeters of bone and I
need 9 like minimum so what they do is
they've to cut open your sinus and they
like push the membrane up with I forget
what he was saying it's like basically
powder or like paste or something that
like hardens into like kind of like a
synthetic bone so they'd cut open my
sinus and he literally wait for it to
like turn hard like the powder or
whatever in your sinus like in the
bottom so that once it turns hard they
can just they like hammer and it like
pushes up the memory and of your sinus
so there's more bone for the implant to
go and do whatever but that was like the
worst ever I was I only had like
novocaine but I was just so like shaky
and uncomfortable and it was I was in so
much pain and basically him hammering up
the membrane of my sinus was the most
painful thing I thought my nose was
literally going to break or like all in
through here like my nose like my like
the bones like around my eyes hurt so
bad because they're just like hammering
my face and it hurts so bad
whatever so then they like put in a
screw I wish I could show you but it's
really nasty I'm not gonna show you
there's like a screw like hanging out of
my gum right there and I have to wait
like three months for that to heal and
then they can put like the fake tooth
there whatever cuz like see yeah you can
see like the stage right there that's
gross but I just wanted to like not do
anything because when I smile
you don't like notice it but he was like
if you don't get an implant you're prone
to all sorts of like jaw problems and
your other teeth will move obviously and
whatever so long story short that is why
that happened yesterday and he's like
you're not allowed to work out for three
days and I literally cried because
working out just makes me feel like sane
and it's just something that I've
learned that learned to love and enjoy
so much ever since I quit lightweight
rolling because now it's mine that I
really like to do instead of something
that I'm forced to do so he said I
couldn't workout for the day I was
really sad and I'm moving to LA on
Wednesday I know I'm going to be wearing
like warm clothes and bathing sits there
and I want to like a look in shape and
do my best
whatever so basically yesterday I
wouldn't bed all day like crying and in
pain and I'm on so much ibuprofen like I
literally take like 600 milligrams every
like six hours which is probably like
the max any person should take ever but
they that like barely helped I could
barely sleep last night I kept waking up
cuz my mouth with just like aching pain
like pounding you know like oh but um
anyway enough complaining I'm just doing
some business you stuff this morning I'm
trying to figure out my taxes I
literally hate taxes there's no horrible
but I'm gonna be on top of my stuff this
year instead of last year I went to H&amp;amp;R
Block I think on April 15th and they're
due like April 18th you know what I mean
so whatever I'm gonna be on top must if
I'm gonna try to clean my room but today
I feel loved to it because it's just
like cluttered and like who needs that I
literally never show over there because
it's gross maybe I'll start packing a
little bit for our just picking out
stuff that I want I want to like get out
of my house like I hate just like
sitting here and being on butt all day
like I I wanna like go to hot yoga and
like go do things but like I'm not
allowed to but maybe I'll just like run
errands a lousier tell her to come
explore with me because I just don't
want to lay here all day
I didn't even show us playing Scrabble
yeah I'm just gonna make my cutie mark
well we get we have to do that later
okay tell them who won everyone I own
the first time and who won the second
time so basically I'm the winner
basically we're smarter than mommy and
daddy then great luck here look at your
face it yeah we're lucky with the words
at your feet you know it's really funny
I'm gonna title the blog Lucy picks your
nose
good morning blog so today is Sunday I
did he can ruin me but right now my
oatmeal oh okay right now my oatmeal is
just cooling on its own meal for
breakfast and then you and mom are gonna
oh goodness why are you so ye poor oh
you know I'm gonna go out the jeomsun I
showered about clean I feel so much

clothing in my antibiotics and hopefully
it feels better - okay bye teddy going
in the gym I've like no or ghetto
clothes at homes fives aware of any
t-shirt
okay looks good today okay I want to
tell them what we put in it so what did
we put in it little bit salt
mm-hmm yep oh well yeah it's gonna be so
good
we did a juice of a full lemon we did a
quarter cup of tahini I can of chickpeas
two tablespoons it looks really good and
this is the hummus everyone it's show
good I think it's so much better than
like Sabra or Cedars or like any of the
ones you can buy because those ones to
me are too strong they taste like really
salty but this is like perfect so
literally make it at home it's so good
if my dad started doing it and we met it

cheaper than like buying it too so
that's good

was so good that was so good did you
like it yeah I knew that one criticism
was a lot of people thought that was
that guy Franz and I we're like too far
