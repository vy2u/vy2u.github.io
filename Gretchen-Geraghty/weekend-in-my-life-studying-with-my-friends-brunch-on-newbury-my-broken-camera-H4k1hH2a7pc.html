got an eight and an eight and a half
because I didn't know it's when I was
and both were way G make and that's an A
and a half I didn't even try those on
the eight I tried on and they were so
big yeah the guy would need a seven or
seven and a half and normally I'm inator

be here um we're going to sleep three
now because hungry night wrong really
that yummy Oh Shh the cameras like
really broken and I don't know if you
can tell right currently in the male
area
Gretchen does not have a credit card she
only has a debit card and she's kind of
upset and defeated because like she
really wants her credit card and it
hasn't come in the mail we didn't
believe you much that we went to do
homework I didn't work not well I did
some I did I she wore number things and
I just every now are going in public
enough I'm getting really scared I'm
scared to stop filming because then he
doesn't let me start again
oh yeah
such a process like this is just so
broken because it falling on the ground
in Aruba that's really sweet
okay it's coming down below oh they
should come up like their favorite sweet
bean salad yeah I get the same one every
single time I was too scared to change
it I usually switch it up but I get the
same couple ones yeah and tonight we're
like once we dip in there and then weird
guys instead say cream pie I was
thinking about I was just going to say
well like it's agreeing with me every
time I know I feel extra like uber know
where to get it and come back but it's
so worth it again and ordering it isn't
the same because they don't excited mess
up I don't like it when they don't mix
it you know they need to wait longer
anyways just like you miss goes down
yeah I think they should make it an
option too like when you order
yeah I know and you're so right if you
just go there and get it and come back
it's quicker than like waiting for it
Scotty
I like that my students you know mine
and almost made yourself tofu me the
most boring blog Abby and Issa our new
friends but yeah there I didn't even log
that this thing was probably not working
you watching this yeah maybe so we love
you um okay going to Florida and see my
attendees wait today sand no military

this thing will work in secret
hang on a sec thank you
yeah I'm really voluminous listen to me
and I've got it
yeah you gotta fix this for a sec so
guys I've been kind of mentioning it but
my camera is just like extremely broken
and I don't really know where to bring
it I'm surprising my parents and I'm
going home in two days so maybe I'll
just go to like a camera store there
that embossing cuz I wouldn't even know
where to go here and I think when you
have a broken canon camera they have to
like send it in so I don't even know
I've been wanting to like vlog every day
this week but then yesterday when I went
to like speak Korean and got ice cream
with Abby that was like the highlight of
the day and then my camera wasn't
working so I kind of logged in my phone
but it's like not nearly as good and
then this morning I wanted to vlog it
just wasn't working and so I just don't
even want to stop talking right now
because once I shut this off it's not
gonna work again but um yeah I just went
to my consumer behavior marketing class
and minami both have exams in it in the
next like two days and we're stressed
this is so much to study for but that's
okay I have to try I hate wearing black
because I just shed all over it oh and
my fat guys you don't need to wear a bra
shirts if you wear a leather jacket over
top or like any jacket really so easy I
mean just really lazy I'm bout to eat a
Apple oh wait this is really exciting I
could show you I got a bunch of these
like health aide coupon things in the
mail and you guys and I'm serves as a
health aide so thank you health paid for
these I love them and I got this other
mysterious package it's very big but I
don't know like what's in it oh my gosh
wait guys I've wanted to give you my
address for so long which sounds really
sketchy
however I've announced it with Jillian
times already that I live in Stevie too
so I might as well just give you my
address because so many people have
asked me before if I have like p.o box
or anything and now that I'm finally
June here like spring of my junior year
but I literally wanted to mention this
since like freshman year my address is
just this weird that I'm giving it out
but like they you guys yeah you guys
know I live in juvie - so you already
know that means 33 again it's fine so if
you guys want to send me anything it's a
Gretchen Garrity 33 Harry again this way
and then the little number 978 for cuz
that's like my box number and then
Boston MA zero to two and five so yeah
because some of you have like DM to me
like beautiful pictures that you drew of
like me or like stuff like that that you
want to like said me it's really cute or
if you just have like a letter or just
like don't feel you have to send
anything but if you want you oh in my
21st birthday is coming up so March 11
just so you know you want to give me a
present don't kidding so that's that and
I always thought that once I said my
address I would make on the title of the
video like where I live it's kind of
like dangerous so I'm just gonna like
tuck this in it's like a normal video um
yeah I hopefully I can get this fixed
today's gonna be a lot of studying I
have my 6:30 to 9 class yeah cuz it's my
day but no I just had it from 1252 - oh
yeah luxury branding was a 6:30 to 9 yep
for 4 wait how is that allowed because I
have my 3 hour class once a week so how
can you have a four hour oh that's
horrible
I mean chem freshman year I had like 8
hours a week so I guess it just depends
on the class but mm-hmm oh oh this is so
good
I get Gala apples kids you're wondering
gallop golf I was so sad without Taylor
here I feel like there's so many people
gone and it's just her I realized I've
never been here when Taylor hasn't been

quiet and sad and empty you know I'm
singing while they're doing a homework</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
