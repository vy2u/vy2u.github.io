of this video it's going to be different
than most my videos and I'm already
apologizing if it's all over the place
because I actually wasn't even planning
on filming this video right now
most of this is just observations I've
made and seen not only throughout
college but just in my 20 years on fan
earth and I'm telling you right now if
you're taking crap from someone you do
deserve better
obviously something sparked this video a
couple days back just something happened
that really got me thinking and
something that I couldn't let go it's
just that people need to treat each
other better I see time and time again
right in front of my face and I know you
guys two girls that are taking crap from
guys that don't have the best intentions
for them and it really can be the other
way around as well I'm not saying that
Zoe's guys fall obviously there's cases
that girls are treating guys probably
too and I just don't let you know if
you're a relationship girl or boy and
you know sometimes not treating you
right get the heck out of there you
don't need someone in your life that
isn't looking out for you and doesn't
have the best intentions for you because
there's other people that will and
there's so many people that love you and
care about you there are some things
that like apologies don't fix and some
people that shouldn't be forgiven and
that's okay when I was younger I thought
I had to be friends of everyone well
it's good to be friendly with everyone
but be cordial be civil there are some
people that don't have the best
intentions for you and don't want you to
be the best version of you and do well
for yourself do well in school whatever
it may be personally I am NOT an amazing
judge of character but I do some friends
that are really good judges of character
girls in boys if one of your best
friends your family doesn't like someone
that you've been interacting with
someone that you're friends with but
someone that your relationship with just
know that that's for a reason it's not
for no reason and also only you can
really look out for yourself you need to
be so strong and work so hard at it like
I still am but use your best judgement
is someone to activate the snake it's
cuz they are a snake like it I know
another way to put it some of the things
I've heard out of guys mouth to girls or
obviously like I said it can you get the
right round
it's just so unacceptable and just go
out of touch it like breaks me inside
like it hurts me that some people are
raised in a way that they think it's
okay to speak to others in certain ways
in which it's totally not encourage you
guys to always be so respectful of
others so respectful of other people's
cultures you have no idea
with someone who's been through or what
they've grown up in I'm sure you have
your problems everyone does I know not
everyone's like me but I find myself
being really happy positive all the time
I know in this video I don't seem like
it
but I am a generally like kind of a
really positive person and only see like
the best in people that's one of my
faults is that I always think everyone
has the best intentions I always think
that people are good people and that
people know the difference between right
and wrong and I'm a good person so I
would never think I would never even
think of like lying cheating stealing
but then other people just aren't like
that and I guess they just don't have it
as strong of a good moral compass I
don't know I know where this video is
going just like be aware and know that
you have your back and that you deserve
better if you have a friend or a
boyfriend or a girlfriend or anyone in
your life that isn't ringing for you
that isn't your number-one fan like they
gotta go because there's so many other
people that are there for you and all
those backs like the golden rule that I
freaking learned in first grade treat
others how you want to be treated if
someone isn't treating you the way that
you know you deserve to be treated get
the heck out of there
you don't need any explanation to them
about why you don't need to talk to them
anymore and be their friend or anything
I guess a lot of this is just advice
like your friends will change you will
probably have multiple boyfriends or
girlfriends and that's okay just the one
isn't that happens that I witnessed
someone speaking to another group of
people in a way that he shouldn't have
at all it was so rude and unacceptable
and just like shocking that it broke my
heart
I mean I guess this can be applied in
all sorts of ways even if you're not
doing your best right now I know
everyone has their troubles maybe you're
going through a really hard time even if
you can't be your number one fan right
now
your number-one fan like I love you all
so much if you're watching this video I
love you I'm here for you if not now at
least someday you can find it within
yourself to love yourself and be your
own number-one fan and just always be
looking out for yourself because in the
end that's what matters most probably so
many of you are like where is this video
coming from this is so general and just
vague and out of nowhere but you
probably deal with circumstances or
instances in the past that it made you
like so upset and full like anger that
you just need to like let it out and
talk about it and it's not appropriate
for me to tell like exactly what
happened but what I learned from it is
don't put up with crap from anyone and
if you are realize that they're probably
going through even a harder time within
themselves if they have to act they
definitely have their own deep-rooted
issues I feel sorry for people that
treat others so horribly you have to
take care of yourself
and be there for yourself and I know I
talked about that in my video where I
talked about I'm seeing a relationship
that I had for three years main point is
you deserve better than relationships
that are bringing you down and aren't
allowing you to be your full best self
and I always want you to be looking out
for yourself I have the best intention
and interest for yourself if you or any
of your loved ones are going through a
hard time just reiterate to them how
much they mean to you because that can
really just make someone's day and yeah
I love you guys so much and I'll see you
my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
