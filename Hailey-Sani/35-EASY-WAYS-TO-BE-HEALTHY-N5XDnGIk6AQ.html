of it go on adventures and take risks go
hiking this is one of my favorite things
to do because you're out in nature you
having fun you're working out at the
same time and it doesn't even feel like
working out and when you're at the top
you feel so great about yourself and
that amazing scenery is literally worth
it if you want the booty you got to do
the squats and if you want to maximize
your results you can definitely drink a
protein shake afterwards my favorite one
is by the brand organic balance as 16
grams of protein which is actually
amazing I like it because it has organic
ingredients and none of them are scary
chemicals and they keep the ingredients
list pretty short so I definitely
recommend it it also tastes amazing I'll
link organic balance down below along
with some coupon codes that you can
definitely use have a nutrition packed
breakfast every morning this is actually
my favorite healthy breakfast so
definitely this view a thumbs up if you
want to see a recipe listening to
classical music makes your brain work
better it relaxes you and helps you
de-stress and I like to do this while
I'm reading a book which is perfect for
improving your thinking skills focus and
concentration meditate to gain inner
peace make a to-do list this will make
your life much more manageable and help
you organize your tasks cut out photo
from your life it'll be the best
decision you've ever made and while
you're at it you might as well just cut
out refined sugars like candy and
instead go to the farmers market every
week eat fresh fruits and veggies and
buy organic foods as much as you can but
don't forget to treat yourself every now
and then go on and run a jog a walk
anything to get you moving
stop eating dead animals aka meat it has
so many more cons than pros stop going
on scale it's how you feel not the
numbers that matter
jump rope to get your heart pumping put
your phone in airplane mode before going
to bed so you can stop radiation and go
to bed earlier
have no make up days to let your skin
breathe write in a journal every day to
keep your creative juices flowing
stretch every morning when you wake up
to release tension and correct your
posture take your vitamins if you need
them just go outside take a deep breath
and admire your surroundings
turn off your damn phone look up and
just realize that this is real life
drink smoothies because why not their
little cups of blended happiness walk
your dog because any time spent with a
dog is a time well-spent cut down the
coffee take 10,000 steps each day and
remember that each step you take is one
more step closer to a happy healthy you
I believe in you and I love you all the
way to Pluto and back turkey ladle a
manana Jason it's your typical autumn a
loose Annette in or domicile keep it a
bit loose in this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
