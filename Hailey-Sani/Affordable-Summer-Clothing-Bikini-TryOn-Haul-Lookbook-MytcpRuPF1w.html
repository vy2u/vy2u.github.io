actually didn't you just bought it on
the satphone caution warning for your
eyes wow you guys are doing great then
it's not like grandma diapers
it's Haley here and today I'm gonna be
filming a huge affordable summer haul if
that sounds familiar
that definitely is because I've done one
of these last year and probably the year
before that in collaboration with
example I love my annual Joseph's Apple
right before the summer because they
stopped me up for bikinis like clothing
just like a bunch of quick little pieces
that I can add to my closet just to prep
myself for the new season and they're
really good at keeping up with trends at
affordable prices which is why I like
them and usually they send me a ton of
stuff like literally almost 50 different
pieces and I try everything on and pick
my favorites out of them that I feel
like you guys would like to and only
share those ones with you guys so I got
two no worries cuz I know sometimes
they're like a little almost sucks all
suspicious you'd have to worry and a lot
of these pieces I've been wearing and
taking pictures and posting them on my
Instagram and you guys go ham in the Tom
that's being like where'd you get that
and I didn't want to tell you guys
because I want to save it for this video
and also really quickly they have free
shipping if your order is over $30 so
that's always convenient so I have
bikinis and clothing items but I don't
want to part the video into two I'm just
gonna jumble them up and mix them
together and this is going to be a try
on haul so I'm gonna be trying on every
single thing that I show you guys even
the bikini so I got you you guys can see
how they kind of like look on me because
like sometimes the things you order all
might don't look the same in person so
you'll have an idea of like what it
looks on but I want to start off with
literally my favorite piece in this haul
you guys saw a pic of me in this it is
the absolute perfect summer dress so it
looks like this it kind of looks like
those like flowy dresses the models
always wear from like realisation bar
and stuff but it's like this it's floral
it's red and super flowy and soft I'll
insert a picture of me wearing it right
here every single comment was weird
that dress so now you know it's from
Zach Oh bitch so literally like look how
cute this is
I love wearing dresses in the summer
because it makes your outfit so cute and
you're literally just throwing on one
piece of item so this is my go-to summer
dress I want to like see if I can find
more on their website so I have like
different different variations the next
item is also a red dress but this is
slightly more like fancy
so obviously the summer is like the time
for going out partying hard no no
sitting at home I mean like I do that
for like 75% of the time but whatever
that's like my goal for this summer go
out have fun make it a good time but
this is just this like red going out
dress it's kind of like skinny on you
and then I really like the top part
because it's like a bustier ER so I
don't know it kind of like makes your
Tatas look a little bit more put
together it's like a cute little going
out dress a very hot very nice so the
next item we have is actually a bikini
set so this is what the top looks like
I'm really diggin like the neutral
colors for the summer usually I go with
really bright ones and there are some of
those in this video but I wanted to go
with like a neutral colored one so this
one's like to hope it's like a taupe
color the full of diamonds and then it
bow ties right in the middle I think
it's gonna look so good it was a tan and
then the bottoms are like the same
pattern except they're like tie on the
sides which I feel like tie on the sides
are a little bit more scandalous it's
still so cute so I'm really digging this
one this one right here is so adorable
I'm so excited to wear it so this like I
think it's called the king hem like
gingham pattern to correct me if I'm
like completely pronouncing that wrong
but it's basically literally like black
and white checkered and I think the top
is a bandeau looks so like sweet and
cute on and then at the bottoms look
like this I'd say they're like semi
cheeky and zaple stepped up they're like
fake game of their bottoms this year
with their bikinis cuz like all the
bikini bottoms that means so well like I
was like wow guys they're doing great
it's not too cheeky so it's not like a
thong and it's not like grandma diapers
it's like the perfect balance in the
middle and I really dig it I think their
bottoms look so cute on now and the set
is just just stole my heart adore the
next set is literally so bright caution
warning for your eyes it's this neon
orange set so the top looks like this
and then the bottoms are just like
regular bottoms in the same color I like
how it kind of looks like a crop top and
it's actually a lot more brighter in
person than it looks on camera and the
main reason I got this is because I get
shout tan in the summer and I feel like
with this like literally neon orange of
bathing suit I'm gonna look like I don't
know like a whole new different level of
tans the bikini bottoms are slightly
bigger so they're kind of like more full
coverage which is which is always a look
you know we're on family and stuff when
you're not trying to like look like the
hose that you are okay next up it's kind
of like a set but I think I purchased
them separately so you can like purchase
them separately if you like so they're
like these plaid postman shorts they're
kind of like cargo like they look like
cargo pants that they're definitely not
cargo like they're
soft material so they're really tight on
your waist and then they're kind of
loose and then it comes with this like
tie that you like tie around it and make
it into like a ribbon right in the front
I think it's gonna look so cute the top
is just as cute it's again tie in the
front very like dainty the back is just
a little stretchy it sits pretty nice on
your top and it's a cute I don't know
it's just something q you could wear it
with white jeans whatever floats your
boat
some people think like sets are like too
much I personally really like them I
think it's like easier to put together
as like a cute outfit okay so the next
big kini said I was kind of really
excited for it because I really loved
the style so the top looks like this and
then it's just white it ties in the
front and the cute or not and then the
bottoms look like this but what I really
like about these is the fact that it
kind of like scrunches up in the back so
it gives you like that like Brazilian
bottom effect it's kind of cheekier but
it makes your butt look so nice who
doesn't like that and also why it looks
good over the tan so yeah I'm happy
about this poaches next thing is the
clothing item it's this top it looks
like it's like for a three-year-old baby
but it really stretches so it's also
cropped it says Paris it has a cute
little rose this is really basic I kind
of like where really like basic tops
like this when I go to the beach with my
friends also I'm going to Paris maybe
I'll wear this there I don't like being
cheesy and like weird like that
so maybe not same reason that I picked
this shirt out it's like very cropped
it's almost like a bando and then
like kind of like the off-the-shoulder
thing going on that's a little tiny
sleeps has this cute little pink flowers
as the pattern you know something cute
again to wear with like jean shorts okay
so the next set the you guys also
already saw my Instagram and we're going
crazy about like where'd you get that
bathing suit so here's the picture by
the way that I posted in it it was for
us and it just looks like this again I
love this like not in the middle fit it
looks really cute it kind of like
presses your boobs down low so they look
a little small but whatever like it's a
cute pattern we're gonna have to deal
with it it's pink and why I love pink
and then the bottoms are again the
really like nice fit
so they're kind these ones kind of look
high-waisted I don't think they were
though and then the back looks like this
not too much coverage the pink and pink
stripes the pinstripes look really good
so this one is a very basic set it looks
like this it's kind of like bando style
and then attached cool thin straps looks
like that and then the bottom sub
bottoms are kind of big on me I don't
know why like they're kind of like
really wide I might link in this to a
friend but they just look like this
regular bottoms if you got big booty not
saying maybe you should down this this
bathing suit I mostly got for the top
because Zappos triangle bikinis fit my
top like really well it looks like
really nice on yeah they're triangle
bikini game it's like really strong and
I really like this yellow color again
like bright colors like this will always
make your tan pop out and like just look
better so I want to have like a fun
summery color and then the bottoms
aren't like ugly
they kind of look like a Dalmatian
pattern again it's like the same fit as
like all the other ones just like semi
cheeky that's Bikini Bottom is like the
same Bikini Bottom is like the pink and
white striped one it's just in red and
yeah it looks like this it's like the
same thing in red basically and then it
comes with these red bottoms but the
bottoms are kind of different than the
pink and white striped ones they're kind
of similar to the other ones that like
scrunch up right here so it's like kind
of like a hotter thing you know though
this little guy would have going on it's
like really like trendy scrunchie
material so it's like definitely really
stretchy and then the bottoms are also
really scrunchie they're kind of tight
on the sides so I don't know how I feel
about the bottom but this cute if you
have a small booty this is gonna make
more sense in the triumph part right now
it kind of looks like a rag is this
white and blue striped dress and then it
kind of looks like a dad shirt or like
like a work shirt for men that like you
stole from your boyfriend but you
actually didn't you just bought it on
that hole because you don't have a
boyfriend
I mean like I do look like he does not
wear things like this so it just buttons
down I love colors and patterns like
this especially cuz I go to Greece like
almost every summer and like this is
such a vibe there like I feel like I'm
some some kind of Sex in the City Greece
edition movie the next thing we have
here is this kind of cropped white plain
basic t-shirt it's so soft like if you
and I like the fact that it has not
right here in the bottom because I
always wear my white t-shirts like that
and I have to like do the knot myself
and sometimes they'll undo and it's all
crinkly like not a vibe I like that this
just like comes with it so I don't don't
worry about your freaking not like being
undone this dress is a little crazy on
see I was like can I even buy something
like this off shackle but I am not
disappointed it's more like a fancy like
event or like a dinner out dress if you
guys know me you guys know that I love
the mixture of like red and nude and
that's pretty much this it's lace all
around it's kind of long it's like up
tier shins and those chops are
adjustable so that's always fun
I feel like a lot of like famous people
have the war and like designer versions
of this and this is like a recreation of
that super cute without having to spend
a ton of money I would definitely see
myself wearing this to like a dinner
with family or like I don't know like a
fancy party with adults okay so this
will not make sense it'll make sense in
the trial part it has white polka dots
and then it's off the shoulder you just
tie and the straps up like this and
that's what it looks like this little
guy here is again like a very simple
like a mini summer dress it's just like
this past now bluish greenish color I
thought would be cute for the summer
because like I said it's very simple
very lightweight something you can just
throw on and look cute I think this
would look so cute with like a white
leather bag and like white sneakers so
yeah yeah yeah for cute summer dresses
they're the way to go literally my
favorite things to wear in the summer
