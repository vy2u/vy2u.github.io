the shower and the first thing that I
like to add to my shower routine if I'm
you know giving myself a little pamper
is putting a hair mask and letting it
sit in my hair for a couple minutes
which I usually don't have the time for
and while I'm waiting for my hair to
soak all that and I like to exfoliate my
skin which I also don't usually have the
time for this is a black salt skin scrub
and I like to use this electric spinny
brush with it
exfoliating your skin is literally magic
to it because you're getting rid of all
the dead skin cells on the surface of it
so you're leaving your skin super smooth
and you're getting rid of all the
bacteria and dirt that's been collected
in your pores so your skin is less
likely to break out even in your legs
and it also fastens the blood flow that
go to your legs and your arms so you're
less likely to get cellulite in those
areas after I'm done scrubbing I like to
wash off all the salt especially this
one because it does leave your legs a
little bit black and this usually takes
around 3 to 4 minutes so then I like to
rinse out all the hair mask that's left
in my hair once I'm done with my shower
routine I go ahead and start with my
skincare since it is a spa day I like to
go all out and really care for my skin
using a skincare set and this is the
subscription box called bio clarity the
subscription box is totally plant-based
and super gentle on my skin and that's
why I'm so obsessed with it the first
step in and clear skin system is the
cleanser which is my personal favorite
out of the three I've really sensitive
skin so when I find a cleanser that
doesn't break me out and it takes off
all my makeup and dirt I obsess over it
so I like to add a little bit on my
exfoliating mint which really gets under
your skin and just cleanse my face with
this before teaming up with them on this
video I tried this set out for two weeks
straight just to see if I could get any
actual results and my skin was literally
glowing by the end of the two weeks and
I was so impressed by it I think what
really got me is the fact that it's
plant-based because when I do use it it
makes me feel a little bit more
conscious of what I am putting on my
skin after I'm all done with the
cleanser I just like to rinse it off and
move on to step number two the second
step is a treatment gel which I kind of
have a like coincidental kind of growth
story about I don't know if you've ever
done this
you know when you squeezed your pores on
your nose and these like white worm-like
things come out that are really
disgusting I'm sorry I looked online I
had to get rid of those and it was like
apply silicic acid and I was like okay
let me find that real quick but then I
saw that this product actually has that
so that's why I like to apply it around
my nose area just to get rid of those
things I think the last product the
flora Lux is the coolest one because it
has like this very interesting green
color and if you want to know what that
is it's what we learned in science class
and fifth grade the thing that's in
plants chlorophyll and how cool is that
because chlorophyll is supposed to turn
like the sunlight into energy that's
literally what this product does it has
a bunch of antioxidants honestly pretty
ten out of ten even though I kind of do
look like Shrek a little bit but it goes
away in like a minute or two I promise
once your skin sucks it up the
subscription box is only thirty bucks
and I have a 50% off coupon code in the
description box and you can also add
their other products to the box which is
what I did this is the hydrate skin
smoothie which is like a really good
moisturizer you can subscribe to the
subscription box using the link down
below and I'm not just saying this
because I teamed up with them I
genuinely think this is a set that you
guys would enjoy so once I'm done with
my skincare routine I move on to some
other fun things I like to hook up my
phone to my speaker just have some music
playing in the background an essential
part of my pamper routine is definitely
tea to eat peach watching I love it
devour mush I meant to say teeth
whitening because this takes a good
amount of time that I usually don't have
and wow that sounds sad these are the
crest white strips and sorry I look
really funny but I feel like they work
the best on my teeth and I usually keep
them on for around 30 minutes to like 45
minutes
they kind of like prevent you from
speaking for a little but it's okay
you're just relaxing in the meantime
taking advantage of me not being able to
do anything because I have oh okay that
happened teeth strips on my teeth I like
to also add in a face mask and just keep
this on around the same amount of time
at this point I have a sheet mask on
teeth whitening strips I'm literally not
capable of doing anything so I like to
take even more advantage of time and
give myself a little bit of a manicure
and I just want to warn you beforehand
I'm really really bad at painting my
nails usually I get them done
like a nail salon I mean I guess they
didn't turn out that bad once time has
gone by I like to take off my teeth
strips and my sheet mask and usually I
like to rub in what's left of the sheet
mask into my skin so we can soak it in
better and that's usually the last step
of my pamper routine thank you guys so
much for watching this video I hope you
enjoyed my pamper slash at-home spa day
routine whatever you want to call it you
can check out bio clarity if you want to
using the link down below and yeah
that's pretty much it I'll see you guys
next Saturday and I love you guys so
much all the way to Pluto and back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
