gonna be filming a back to school haul
because I kind of went shopping crazy
crazy shopping I'm about to dive into
this cuz this let's go
so the first online store I shopped at
was called Princess Polycom and there's
a cutest Australian online store I
absolutely love them their link will be
in the downbar and I definitely
recommend you guys check that out cuz
look at this skirt it's amazing quality
like you can tell from the way it feels
and even cuter it's a set so it comes
with this top and it's like a tie up
shirt it has this cutout going straight
down the middle and then the back is
non-existent it's just high up and I
think these two would look so cute
together I've never owned anything like
this and I'm so excited to try it out
see if I like it moving on I purchased a
bomber if you guys know me you don't
obsessed with bombers but this one I'm
especially obsessed with cuz it's in
this like powdery pink color
I think blush is what you would step and
call it I don't think I have a lot of
clothes in this color so I like it
moving on I bought two pairs of denim
ripped jeans these ones are just so
these distressed boyfriend jeans with
all these cutouts and I really like it
the second one I was supposed to be
white but I guess I forgot to select the
color option so I'm stupid and it looks
a lot similar to the one I showed you
guys earlier but nevertheless they're
really cute and they're really good
quality next I got this black coat and I
just think those go on so many models
I'll insert pictures right here but when
I saw this one on the website I was like
I need to get this this needs to be a
part of my winter closet and even though
Cobham doesn't really get close to
winter in the mornings
my time it's like Antartica the quality
is actually amazing very chic
the next thing I got is also a jacket
and it's this really oversized denim
jacket I like oversized things it's not
like super heavy and super thick which I
kind of like - if you don't have a denim
jacket you should definitely look at the
purchasing one because I think it's an
essential that everyone should have in
their closet the last thing I purchased
on fences poly which I'm so excited
about because I've been looking for
something like this for as long as I can
remember it's this double buckled
Western belle and these have been all
over Instagram all over every outfit
you've probably ever seen and I was like
I need that and I love the detailing so
much I cannot wait to pair these with
jeans and skirts and shorts so that's
all I got from princess Polly I actually
have a 20% off coupon code that you guys
can use and don't miss this chance guys
I got you moving on to shoes so I want
to kind of like branch out my shoe
comfort zone if that makes any sense I
got three pairs of shoes from Eagle
official and the first ones are a little
crazy I have not one of them yet I don't
know how to style them but I feel like
once I do they're gonna be super cute so
there are these pink heels and they have
like the whole rain boot feeling texture
type of thing and then the heel have
this really cool silver / gold detailing
leave a comment down below how you think
I should style it the next - booth you
may or may not have already seen on my
Instagram which is acne sunny if you
don't follow me already there are these
nude knee-high boots and they're also
suede and amazing qualities they tie up
right here and then they're obviously
heeled these are just so cute they're
amazing
I usually saw these with like a t-shirt
dress and a good check out the laughs
there I got so many compliments on my
Instagram and actually wore these on my
first day of school and there are these
gray suede boots and the heel can we
take a moment to talk about how cool the
lots of things are actually sunglasses
are just kind of irrelevant from back
school but I don't want to film some
cause really to sunglasses so deal with
me here I got them on a website called
Luna and can we just there are these
reflective glasses in the rose gold and
then these ones are great and they're
also reflective but I really like the
detailing around them these glasses make
any outfit effortlessly cooler like you
wear these and you're like oh well what
okay thanks hi
so that was it for part 1 of my back to
school haul a lot of part two really
suited with even more clothes a lot more
clothes but thanks so much for watching
this video and I love you guys so much
all the way to flu and back buddy what
you say what you to have a baby with you
hey some niggas I'll be right back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
