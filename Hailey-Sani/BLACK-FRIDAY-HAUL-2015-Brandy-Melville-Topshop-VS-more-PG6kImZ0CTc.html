having me filming a black friday haul
because i went black friday shopping
yesterday but i didn't really buy a lot
of things so they're also going to be
stuff that I bought before Black Friday
I literally had to Google how to do a
messy bun in order to do this tell me if
I got it right I don't know I know I
don't know I never feel comfortable
filming videos with funds I doesn't know
why but anyway without further ado I'm
gonna get started with a brandy method
the deal in brandy melville was 20% off
the entire store which I guess was good
so I got this periwinkle like ribs dress
it's originally $23 but I got it for
1840 it doesn't fit me so I'm gonna have
to return it which is really sad because
I really liked it the second thing I got
is so cute I'm dying I can't wait to
wear it so it's basically this like
black skirt with like white stripes and
it has like cute little cutouts like in
the ends this is also big as you can see
but my mom said she would be able to fix
it so that I could wear it and I'm like
bless you mom so you this was originally
$26 but I got it for 20 the last two
things I got I didn't get on Black
Friday I got this white shirt everybody
has it it's like cropped buttons running
down the middle very cute and then I got
this
oh my god it's matching I feel like I'm
twinning with a dress it's super soft
you guys know Brandi Brandis like the
softest clothing store in the world
speaking of soft stuff next I went to
Zara and Zara had in my opinion
hands-down the best sale it was 30
percent on everything like I hate it
when stores are like Oh 50% off of the
things that are already on sale but the
things that are already on sale are ugly
that's why they're on sale like I got
this like white oversized shirt and it's
softer than Brandi is that
thing and it was originally $10 but I
got it for seven seven dollars next I
got the same shirt in like a different
pattern it's like this Navy white
striped shirt again very soft only $7
and then I got these jeans which are my
favorite jeans right now um they're
black I wore them to the black bear
concert yesterday which guys
it was amazing best concert I've ever
been to I knew all the songs by heart I
was like screaming it jumping and
everybody was like what is this 15 year
old doing at this concert jumping up and
down anyways so there are these jeans
they have like four zippers and then
they have ramparts over the knee I think
they're really nice and then I got a
pair of jeans before Black Friday these
are just some like denim ripped jeans
they have like rips over here but
they're not like too distressed I just
really needed a staple pair of like
Denver ripped jeans like they're
distressed at the end so I think they're
really cute next up I went to Topshop
and Top Shop worst Black Friday ever I
mean I I don't think they even had any
cute stuff on sale but I did get one
thing that wasn't even on sale and is
just this ripped gray tank top it was
$10 and then the last Black Friday
related thing I got was this perfume
from Victoria Secret this is the
heavenly perfume and it was like $25 I
don't know there was like some deal so
my mom just told me to pick out a
perfume and I got this one and with that
they gave AV sparkly Victoria Secret
tote and it's so big I can fit in it and
they said it would have essential beauty
products and goodies inside but CMT has
my soul so moving on to everything that
I got before Black Friday so I went to
forever 21 and I had
in there and like a bag I hadn't been
there like a year very exciting I got
this green pair of like army jeans and
they have like pockets and the size
which I think are really cute however
these used to fit me perfectly when I
first moved here but I've been like
working out a little so now they don't
fit me they're too big so I might return
it and then I got this gray like casual
skirt and it's like really cool it looks
like you tied as tighter around but it's
actually just the skirt and then I got
this skirt it looks like a towel it's
not a towel it's like this raped like
wool sweater material skirt and it's out
of my comfort zone so when I wear this I
feel like kind of weird then I got like
this denim flannel a denim shirt
whatever you want to call it my dad
actually picked that up for me and then
I got this shirt that I've been wearing
non-stop it's cropped quarter sleeve and
off the shoulder but it was like $90 I
really like it and then I got this
sweater and it's just a black sweater it
says oh wow which means goodbye around
the collar and it's cropped that's that
and then finally I got like this workout
sports bra and I wear this like every
time I work out and not lying workout
clothes give you motivation to workout
that's really why I buy workout clothes
next up I have hmm and I only have two
things the first thing was this persley
ribbed gray shirt it has like a low
neckline and then I got this skirt I
want to return really bad because okay
so it's like really cute '''l like I
really like it however it's like way too
big on me so it's like really long and
when it's like really long it doesn't
even look cute it looks weird besides
the fact that it's a cute skirt it
doesn't really fit me that well and you
guys are probably like hailey why does
it anything this whole fit you I don't
know everything in this whole used to
fit me and then after I bought it and
like started wearing it a few times
it stopped fitting me last thing I got
was a pair of shoes and you probably saw
this one like this
Graham because I wear it every single
day I got ideas Superstars and these are
like old friend needs so cool I tried to
keep them white because I think they
look better like that
um there's like bloodstains on the side
don't even ask I just kicked this girl
in the face just getting so the coach
made this like a run on an on running
day and those are the wishes I had so my
foot started reading because I was still
breaking into them thanks coach and then
I got this choker oven I'm getting this
my dogs anyways that's it for this haul
thumbs up if you liked it also comment
down below if you think I should keep
this background but yeah thanks for
watching - guys I love you all so much
