want her to be in this field because we
fight a lot and you'll see that
throughout the videos but who could say
no to this pretty face of hers so yeah
and we share all these products story
yeah we share all of them yeah so let's
get started
so the first product we have here is
lonely because we don't have another one
of these this is quite cool because this
side is just shimmer and gel on this
side it's lotion and you can twist it up
to like use the amount that you want if
you want more lotion you just turn it
here if you want more speckles in there
and then there's right in the middle
ready to knit both yeah that's really
cool and this was this is beautiful it
smells like pomegranate pomegranates and
roses so the second product that we have
is the triple moisturize body cream and
it's the malibu malibu key and I love
this it's like the packaging is so cute
and like oh it's like sunset and it's
like metallic there and this smells I
like California oranges was it kind of
it she never lets me talkin me yes the
next trip of moisture body cream we have
is insi Island cotton and this is the
best fresh smell ever it just smells
like the ocean and it smells like the
beach no it doesn't smell like the beach
it smells like this melt like the beach
the sea it smells really fresh and just
smells so good and this smells like what
does it smell fresh tulips and apple
blossoms and we got this little pump for
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works as well and you can
like you didn't tell them what the name
was did Paris or more on Paris and they
have like this Paris flooring so this is
sweet on Paris and this smells like
cupcakes
it smells really neat it smells like
sugar it smells like cupcake frosting so
the next things we have our body butters
so the
first one is the darkest intense
moisture body butter and this is my
favorite smell Thanks it's like our
favorite scent and I love this and it's
described as musk and berries yes
berries and I love body butters because
she's a lot don't ya anybody I was like
really thick and they're so moisturizing
and then I'm fancy I don't know they
haven't this weird extremely they're
said hey and then the next one we have
is this one and the travel size one
memory type and this one is sweet pea
body butter but I ripped like the thingy

yeah so the first one we have is this
vanilla bean Noel one and we got this
and Christmas because it was on sale and
it's like pretty big size and this not
like really sugary yeah yep it sounds
like the vanilla bean Frappuccino my
standards but if you spray too much of
this it smells really bad
you got ya just gotta spray it once and
that's it or it'll be really disgusting
so the next one we have is sweet pea

of me and you could just need this
