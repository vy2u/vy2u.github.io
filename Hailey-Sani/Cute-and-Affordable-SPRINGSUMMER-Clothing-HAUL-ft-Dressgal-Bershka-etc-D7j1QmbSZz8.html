been growing girl I'm not okay love you
never show your and today I'm really
filming a clothing haul and this is
gonna be some really cheap and cute
clothes that are for like spring and
summer and some of these products were
sent to me by companies and actually aid
company and some of them I just went and
bought stores so without further ado
let's get started so the first place I
ordered off of is called dress Capcom
and I'll link it down below and they
reached out to me and they were like hey
come to our website we got some clothes
share them with your viewers and I was
like sure because when I find stuff
online that are affordable and cute
I definitely want to share with you guys
my friends so I can say no so the first
two things I bought were two pairs of
leggings and their workout leggings cuz
I like to work out and this one says
work out on it and it's like bright pink
I promise you guys all the stuff is
really affordable nothing costs more
than 10 bucks then this one says just to
it like Nike ones and I thought it'd be
really cute for working out in fashion
so I went ahead and got those so then I
got these two tank tops they're just
like tank tops that look like this but
they're cropped so they're going to be
really cute for the summer because I
personally like wearing really simple
pieces and summer and they look like
brandy melville probably at brandy these
would cost like at least $15 each but I
got them for like $3 or something I
actually like the great one better I
don't know I really like
right so money next I got this white
halter top and halter tops are always in
fashion but I ordered this in a medium
because they did have small they sent it
to me in a large so I don't know
remember that grandma that I talked
about in like every single video that I
might give it to her so she could just
like make it a little smaller on the
sides got a lot of grandmas
the next product reminds me so much of
brandy and it's this red and white
striped crop too you can tell I really
like stripes can't Jam it it's really
simple but I love the whole like red and
white stripes going on and stuff the
next thing I got was a sweater and on
the website this looks like maroon but
it's bright red guys it's just like
bright red
it's literally that color and it says
1985 I don't know what that is and it
was like two stripes in the sleeve and
even though this is a sweater it's
pretty thin so I'm pretty sure I can
wear on like chilly nights in the summer
because it does get chilly at night
times where I live and the last thing is
definitely not summer but I love it and
I wish I could purchase this earlier in
the year and it's this like wool um like
oversized flowy jacket and it's got like
this black and white actually it's not
really white it's kind of like creamish
grayish color so many shades of gray it
looks very like chic chic you know I'm
trying to not look like a hobo here so
like I said I got all this stuff from
dress count calm and I'll put their
website link down below
the next place I went to was at Bershka
and sucks for you guys that live in the
saves you don't have rush gov but I
really shouldn't be talking because we
don't have like anything else but brush
gun so I'll shut up now I managed to
find some affordable things whoa is this
not showing up but anyways it's this
white sheer of what I don't know what
you call it it's really flowy
it's got again like that whole expensive
chic modern vibe to it
and I think I'm going to be wearing
these with like colorful bra let's under
cuz it's see-through and it will look
really cute in the summer and I got
another thing which was quite similar to
that and it's this what is this okay
it's this really cropped a white flowy
top and it's like a paint job and this
is way too cropped so I'm probably gonna
be wearing this with high waisted stuff
I'll make it work with like a flower
crown or something because it's got this
Coachella vibes
I'm back hoe chela how much just suck
just at home while everybody is out
there listen to some good music and live
in their life so good and then I got
these gray weird patterned leggings that
I just need a burpee the last thing I
got from a random jewelry store where I
live were these sunglasses and I'm so
excited for these because they're so
fashion lately and I think they look
really cute
they've got oh my god I can't bring I
can't breathe okay
so yeah these were 45 bucks it was from
this brand called Almera
I've never heard of it before but yeah
that's it for this haul guys I know it
was kind of short but I just want to ask
you if you want me to make like kind of
a spring lookbook using the items in
this video then give this video a thumbs
up and let me know in the comments down
below
yeah see you next time I love you all
tomato and
but you know the reason
driving
