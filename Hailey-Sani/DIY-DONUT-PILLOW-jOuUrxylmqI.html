gonna be teaching you how to make your
very own DIY donut pillow and here are
the things that you're gonna be needing
some kind of soft fabric like fur or
fleece and a cream color because
obviously donuts are clean you're also
gonna be needing some pink or brown felt
depending on what color you want your
glace to be for the sprinkles on top you
can pick out any colorful beads that are
long and thin that look like sprinkles
you're gonna be needing some white
thread and thread that matches the color
of your sprinkles since this is a song
project you're going to be needing and
needle and some scissors to cut out the
fabric and last you're gonna be needing
some fiber to fill in the pillow so
first you're gonna be needing a big
circle so you can make the perfect donut
shape and just put this on your pink
felt and trace it out next we're gonna
be needing a smaller circle and make
sure this is right in the middle and
trace that out as well now if you get
your scissors and start chopping just
like first grade
when it's time to cut the circle on the
inside just fold it in half and with
your scissors cut a little slit right in
the middle and now you could work your
way out inside the circle and this is
what it should look like once you're
done so now it's time to sew on the
sprinkles so thread your needle and I'm
going to be getting my blue beads and
just stick in your thread from under the
glaze and pull it out from the other
part and now you can put in a beef
through your needle and pull it down
now here's what you're gonna do you're
gonna stick the needle right next to the
bead and then pull it out again from the
bottom so this is what it should look
like and you can just repeat that step
stick it in put in a key bead and then
stick the needle back in whatever
direction you want the sprinkles to be
facing and just do it all over again
and then I switched to another color the
Dona itself has to be a little bigger
than the glace so you need a bigger
circle to trace so make sure it's just a
little bigger than the pink but on the
other hand the circle in the middle has
to be smaller than the circle that we
made in the pink belt also make sure the
fleece is two layers so you can cut two
circles at once after you're done
cutting just thread your needle and
start sewing around the donut after
you're finished sewing just tie two or
three knots and cut off your thread and
now just grab the donut from the middle
and flip it inside out as if you are
just flipping inside out a dirty shirt
or something like that
and now you can start sewing the icing
onto the Mona but make sure you just
throw it onto the first layer of the
donut because then you don't want it to
stick together without you being able to
fill it up first so you could just sew
it normally or sew it by adding more
beads as you go along the way which is
what I did and once you're done just tie
a knot at the end and also sewed the
outside part of the icing onto the donut
into the very fun part which is filling
it up so we actually starts looking like
a pillow and once you're done filling it
up
you have to sew the inside part of the
donut so it doesn't explode and go all
over the place and we are finally done
you can put it on your bed now and
what's wrong guys we managed I hope you
enjoyed this video guys and I hope you
found it useful thanks for watching love
you all - Pluto and that bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
