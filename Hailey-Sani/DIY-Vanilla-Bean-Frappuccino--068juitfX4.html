you how to make a vanilla bean
Frappuccino and here are the things that
you're going to be needing a blender ice
cubes milk vanilla ice cream sugar cubes
vanilla extract and a measuring pot so
first you're going to be needing 1 cup
of ice and just put the ice in your
blender and just crush it because you
want your eyes to be really small don't
want huge ice ice cubes so just plug in
your blender and mix the ice cubes crush
them up for two to three minutes and
then you're going to be getting your
measuring cup and you're going to be
getting 1 cup of milk and if you like
cracked you know to be sweeter than I
recommend you put a little less milk but
I just put that much and then I got 3
scoops of vanilla ice cream and I just
put that in the blender as well I put
one sugar cube and a few drops of
vanilla extract and I just mixed it all
up my blender as you can see I'm having
some trouble putting on the cap answer
leaking so I just put the blender in a
bowl and just continuing what I was
doing
you're done so I just got this tall
glass and put my property no in there if
you have a Starbucks tumbler that's even
better and yeah so I just put it in
there and I was done and it tasted
incredible guys it tasted really good
and it was really easy to make and now
you can take your own Instagram picture
posted so yeah thanks for watching this
video guys hope you enjoyed it bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
