gonna be sharing with you four easy
hairstyles for short hair because I
recently cut my hair ten inches I have
been obviously playing around with it
trying to figure out what works best for
me so without further ado let's get
started so for the first hair tutorial
I'm gonna be using my nume curling wand
I feel like a wizard a wizard so I'm
going to be turning it on to 160 degrees
Celsius and while this is heating up at
where do I put it I don't want to like
throw your nails so I'm just gonna be
putting on some heat protectant spray
while that is heating up and I'm gonna
be brushing my hair out because you
don't want to get any knowledge they
want to get that power but Carl what I
love about the Mui hair curling wand is
the fact that it comes with three
interchangeable wands so you can get
like really tight curls you can get like
really big loose ones or just like
middle ones so for the first year look
I'm simply going to start off by curling
my hair
have you seen that video where the girls
like curling her hair and then she just
like brings it all in she went on Ellen
I know you're breathing very loudly I
really like that curly one did you burn
it away hey can I have a chocolate
covered almond yeah yeah for sure
whatever you Haley away from you right
now my waves do look a little too much
put together so what I like to do is run
my fingers through them no give them a
little shake pretend you're like in a
Pantene commercial I also like the nume
curling wand because it holds the curls
for a pretty long time especially if you
have hair that doesn't hold curls that
like it's perfect you know I really like
that one like I'm not even like joking
function well if you really want it is
II actually have to discount codes for
you guys and you the first one is the
code berry pink lips is the Titan 3 for
$99 plus free shipping and for the
discount code you love Haley you can get
any curly one you want for $49 plus free
shipping and these are pretty good deals
for a pretty good hair scrolling on so
I'll definitely link new me and all the
discount codes down below so this is the
first hairstyle you can either keep it
like this or you can definitely turn it
into a half-up half-down bun not
milkshake
voice the yard and they're like it's
better than yours damn mic is better
than yours I could teach you sometimes I
like to rock my half of half down fun if
I'm not feeling the waves I'll be
feeling the break so I just like to
split my hair in the middle like stuff
oh that's not the middle so I start off
by grabbing a piece in the front like so
and splitting it into three other pieces
and then you just start off by actually
doing a normal braid and as we're going
just keep getting pieces from the side
of your hair and adding it onto your
braid this is actually one of my
favorite hair looks because you just get
your hair out of your face it looks cute
I like the vibes can you say you like
the vibes of your hair they're fun you
feel like a boxer I also feel like the
braids look more like voluminous
if you braid them after you curl that so
now what I like to do is grab a little
bit of my hair from this side just grab
like 1/4 twisty twist and shout twist
and shout come on come on come on come
on come up back so now we move on to the
next one don't you wish your gun was
that me
and this is my last look this is kind of
like a crazy ordinary crazy ordinary um
antonyms I think it's so cute like every
time I do this hairstyle I either feel
like Mickey Mouse or Miley Cyrus and
like both of those things are like
pretty cool so thank you so much for
watching this video guys I hope you
enjoyed it I love you all so much all
the way to play-doh and back bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
