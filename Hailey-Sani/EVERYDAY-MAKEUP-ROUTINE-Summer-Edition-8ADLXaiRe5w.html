going to be filming in my everyday
makeup routine but this particular day I
wanted to film the talking video but at
the same time I wanted to film my
everyday makeup routine so I thought I'd
do both and I just had to come like a
chitchat everyday makeup or tuned if you
know what I'm saying okay so go back to
those times when I used to put like
glitter eyeliner on my face and like
blue eye shadow when I was 12 and call
it my everyday makeup routine you know I
start off with my concealer this is the
Maybelline fit me I believe and this is
my eyes I saber know nothing wrong with
some amazing concealer I like to put it
all over my face even though that's not
what concealers for but we care and then
I just like to go out into the street
with left this because yeah well anyways
I'm gonna be giving my Beauty Blender
and it's a little damp this morning I
was really sad because there's this oh
what's it called uni you Lee um doll
festival going on actually it's not
going on yet where they like kill dog
and then they like slice their skin they
cook them they cut them up they heat
them up until I get in under the Wilton
until they die and it's just really sad
and there's actually a campaign going on
on change.org I think where you like you
can sign your petition its purpose is to
stop the festival there's only like
three more days left and they still need
like a million five hundred thousand
people to sign the campaign so if you
want to like stop the cruelty I will
link it down below by the way this isn't
sponsored or anything it's just me being
human I would really appreciate it if
you signed it and we could save the
lives of some dogs because it's just sad
it's cruel it's like I see humans but I
don't see humanity speaking of dogs my
dog Milka my puppy actually because he's
still like eight months old by the way
is this blended enough
I can't tell my beauty blender stinks I
just realized that it's really big I
think I whittled much it was now I'm
gonna be getting some powder to set this
all on to be honest I feel like setting
your makeups a myth I don't know I just
do it because other people do it I
haven't like ever like seen a difference
with my makeup set than it is when I
don't set it I just do it because I
don't know it makes it a little bit more
matte I guess that's what I like about
it
my puppy Milka by the way Belka like the
chocolate I swear his name sounds better
in Turkish it's a little weird in
English but he got his fur like trimmed
he got like a haircut I guess I forgot
and he looks really funny I make fun of
him a lot for that sorry
usually I don't put on eyeliner if I'm
like doing something really basic but I
thought I would put on eyeliner because
I do do it on some days and I want to go
all out for the video you know yay
by the way suck at applying eyeliner so
sorry if it takes like six days
like that's what I was talking about you
know when I said I suck it out on there
now I gotta go get some remover
is that wing okay I don't know I don't
feel so good about it
raise your hand if you're okay was like
putting eyeliner on your right eye but
when it comes to your left eye to look
how do I put this eye on there there we
go I I'm actually like having trouble
with this like if you guys have any tips
for like people that can't put on
eyeliner I mean you know not I'm not
asking for myself I'm just asking for a
friend you know like I'm pretty good at
this oh my god I'm shaking I'm old now
it's not me it's eyeliner the eyeliner
sucks I'm actually amazing we're just
gonna have to go with it like I feel
like I was saying something oh yeah my
dog he got a fur cut and he's really
naked and funny now roflmao
see what I did there so tomorrow's the
last high school for me actually I
haven't been going to school for like
two weeks because they've just been
watching movies and not doing thing and
I've got better things to do than watch
movies but I have to go tomorrow to get
like my report card I don't want to see
those ugly people but I've got to do
what you can do okay so this mascara is
the Victoria Secret actual lengthening
mascara and I got this when I was in
like I think seventh grade and I know
it's expired and everything but black
bear idea see anyways so I'm in love
with this mascara because it just makes
my eyelashes go all the way to Mars look
at that it makes them like huge it makes
it looks like I'm wearing falsies or
something but now it's discontinued and
I want to cry like I feel like I'm
losing my best friend we might be out we
might be moving back to the US
soon and I'm really excited almost like
something really extraordinary happens
and we can't go but it's definitely
going to happen we just don't know when
it's definitely going to happen in the
next two years sometime I want to go on
August I want to move there not August
so I can start my freshman year there
and you're probably wondering wait
aren't you already like a freshman I'm
actually supposed to be a freshman I
graduated from eighth grade two years
ago but this past year I started a
French school so I could learn French
okay we're done with the eyes um what am
I do next oh yeah my face I'm going to
be getting my NYC bronzer because I
always do that and just bronze my face I
love it when I have like a tam face
because my cheekbones are already like
really high not writing anything that
sounded like really arrogant but they're
already high so I don't like extra
contour then I feel like I look like a
dead corpse but as I started a friend
this is really hard talking and like
doing this on Colonel I started a French
school so I could learn French so I was
in prep class it's like a it's like
making high school five years instead of
four I know I'm stupid I wish I hadn't
done that uh do you just see what I did
this is why I shouldn't talk while I'm
putting on makeup anyways um so I
learned French for this year and I'm
supposed to be ninth grade I've just
been like moving around a lot I have
never ever had like lasting friendships
so that's kind of made me
like an introverted person can I say
that introverted person is introvert an
adjective anyway it's just made me an
introvert and okay now I'm getting my
dream bouncy blush and I like to apply
this like this like smile by the bag
like no I don't smell like that I'm just
like patted on my cheeks because I found
that the best way that works for me made
me an introvert and I'm kind of sick of
it if you have any tips for like foreign
students aka me that like new to America
leave them down below or any like tips
for newcomers in high school and now I'm
going to be getting my MAC lipstick from
the shade pink plaid this is like an
everyday natural nude pink pink color
and it's matte and I'm all in for the
matte
I have found out that I actually suck at
applying lipstick it's the first thing
people learn when they're like starting
out with makeup and I just can't like
this is literally my everyday makeup I
feel like I didn't even explain anything
sorry that's it for my whole makeup
routine I love y'all puto and back bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
