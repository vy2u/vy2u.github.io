what's that be comfortable baby does it
ever
hey guys it's Hayley sunny and today
we're gonna be filming an everyday
makeup tutorial how I beat my face Sam I
beat it cuz he not was just very like
neutral this is basically what I put on
my face every time I do my makeup I have
a few giveaways going on my Instagram so
make sure you follow me on there to stay
tuned if you're not already make sure
you click Subscribe it's right over
there with a little I mean I guess
there's supposed to be a little bell
next to it you should click it so you
can get a notification every time I
upload which is every single Saturday
with a surprise gonna go sometimes
thrown in during the week every now and
then without further ado let's go ahead
and get started
do I look like an elf when I put my hair
back I hope not I'm gonna read
motorizing my face the coconut water
cream by first aid beauty like coconut
water it's really really refreshing and
cooling you don't want cakey skin so
make sure your skin is nice and
moisturized and soft next up I'm gonna
be priming my skin this is the benefit
Porefessional I never got to like
actually try this until they sent it to
me a couple days ago but like a week ago
and it's crazy how much better my makeup
looks when I use this versus when I
don't so sometimes I just like to throw
in the extra step and use this before I
apply anything else on
I was at the nail salon today and
something's so like crazy and that makes
me so angry and like shocked at the same
time happen and I literally didn't know
how to react and now but like it's over
with and I'm home I have so many like
things that I like feel like I should
have done in that moment so I'm gonna
tell you guys a little story in a minute
so when I'm doing my everyday makeup I
usually skip foundation just because I
don't really like the feeling of having
that on my skin throughout the day and
also because I don't really feel like I
need it which is a blessing but I do
like to use concealer because as you can
see I have quite the dark circles these
are the Born This Way concealers by Too
Faced so first I get a little bit of a
darker shade which is more medium which
is exactly my skin tone and I like to
apply a good amount of that under my
eyes just like making a little triangle
and I like to apply a little bit of this
concealer which is in the shade light
just like its name it's a little bit
lighter so I feel like it gives some
nice like brightening effect and I like
to apply just a little bit of that over
it grabbing my Beauty Blender which is a
little bit damp I just start bringing it
down to my face anyways what happened at
the nail salon so I was just there
sitting waiting for my nails to dry and
this lady walks in and like the minute
she walks in just she brought this bad
energy and I don't like really say that
about a lot of people but like I don't
know that's just what I felt and she
sits down she's on the phone like very
obnoxiously like talking so loud that
literally every single person the nail
salon could hear her like conversation
she's like talking to this person
probably like someone she's like
flirting with cuz she's like I just
bought this Saint Laurent bag and I'm
like honey it's not even how you say its
thing Laurent like I'm gonna using some
setting powder to set what we just did
this is the Born This Way setting powder
and you just shake it up a little I feel
like this is such a good setting powder
because it's not heavy at all this is
super light on your skin so like I said
it doesn't make it look really cakey
just a very natural look the nail lady
obviously knew she was on the phone but
she like had to get her job done so she
was like do you want your nails to be
like square or circle and this lady
ignores her and on the phone continues
to speak to her friend and then she
starts saying the people does nail salon
are so rude and annoying like I had to
tell them to be quiet because I'm on the
phone and then she gets off the phone
and she's like you're so rude I don't
know who gave you this job but like can
you see I'm on the phone and the lady is
literally like okay like how can someone
be that rude
having a bad day isn't even an excuse
for like making someone feel that way I
don't know it just like it was very
shocking to me I'm gonna be contouring
with the Too Faced chocolate Soleil
bronzer
recently I've been using a little bit
more of like a bigger brush because I
don't know I feel like it makes your
contour look a little bit more natural
and it also gives a bronze glow to like
the rest of your face kind of this
bronzer smells so good like I literally
want to lick my face after anyway is
just trying to be nice to people
actually got my eyebrows done today
because I knew I was gonna film this and
didn't want my eyebrows to look so messy
because that's how they were before I'm
gonna be experimenting with a few new
products so this is a conditioning brow
primer it looks like this super
interesting apparently it makes your
brows look more full and like Prime's em
for when you do them let's see recently
I've been using brow pencils I switch
off between like different types of brow
products sometimes I will use like gel
but this smells like brownies and I love
it I want to eat my eyebrows after I
just like to draw a thin line under my
brow to begin with and then kind of just
like do light strokes on the inside a
few strokes upwards towards like the
start of my brow
so much easier to do your brows after
you get them done like and repeat this
is my favorite step blend if you look
blending just makes everything look
better just more natural you don't want
like brow pencil lines across your eye
this is just some colored brow gel and I
just like to apply in the middle of my
brows because that's where it tends to
get more sparse and it gives this like
really youthful look makes your eyebrows
look a little bit more full another
product that I wanted to experiment with
this is the benefit 24-hour brow setter
so it's like a clear brow gel that's
supposed to keep your eyebrows in place
for 24 hours girl I need to coat my
eyebrows like every hour or else they
start looking crazy so if you can keep
your promise you will be my life Savior
to the end of time oh my god I can
already feel my eyebrows like setting
and like drying kind of a weird
sensation next I'm grabbing this matte
highlighter pencil by morphe and I just
like to draw a line under my brows it
just highlights my brow bone but at the
same time makes my brows with very
clean-cut I've been loving blush I used
to skip blush all the time just because
I didn't like it but now I dig a like
natural color blush on my cheeks it just
makes me look happy I mean I am happy so
it enhances my contentment this is in
the shade baby love it's by Too Faced I
use a lot of to face makeup smile if
you're not a big blush person like
natural blushes like this one just like
adds a little bit warmth to your face
without looking very intense I've never
tried this highlighter it's dandelion
twinkle by benefit it looks very pretty
in the box let's see if it can look that
pretty on my face
oh yes what highlighter looks to
blinding I feel like it's not a look it
doesn't look natural it looks like you
tried way too hard you're not even like
glowing anymore hurting people's
eyesight so you know when it's really
subtle but still noticeable that's the
perfect touch you guys know me I'm not a
very big eye shadow person especially
for everyday makeup but what I've been
doing recently is kind of defining my
crease with a fluffy blending brush this
is the Just Peachy mattes palette I'm
gonna be using that color which is in
the shade peach tea I always drink the
Lipton peach teas that come in like
hands and whatever is so good like
America you are lacking so just blending
that and then you can bring it down to
your lid just a little yeah this is a
little orange e too but I feel like it
looks pretty especially since I have
green eyes I don't know it brings out
the green I guess you can also bring it
down to your lower lash line caramel
ashes girl
wait I can't multitask I can't talk and
curl my lashes I feel like I know I use
it this mascara in every video but it's
just my favorite I don't think I can
ever like a mascara more than I like
this once the better than sex mascara by
Too Faced
quite proud of myself for not making the
ugliest faces while applying this
mascara and don't forget the lower lash
line this is my absolute favorite lip
product just because it's so easy to use
it's literally a tinted lip balm by
glossier but this is my favorite like
lip color ever it's in the cherry color
and it's just like my natural lip color
except a little bit more enhancing so
nothing too crazy it doesn't even look
like I have any color on my lips and at
the same time it's super glowy I wish I
could get like lip injections for like
two days just to see how it look and
then I finish everything off with The
Hangover setting spray I tried out
multiple setting spray some of them
literally just melt your makeup off this
however I feel like just makes it look
better without even doing anything like
it's just a spray but I just feel like
it makes it look more glowy shake well
but that's six inches I don't know I
don't I don't work in inches I'm born
and this is the finished makeup look
this is literally what I wear if I wear
makeup every single day I kind of come
to realize that I don't really like
doing anything else but this I feel like
this is the only look that like even
looks good on me unless I'm like getting
my makeup done by like a makeup artist
I'm a fan of the more natural look
anything that's a little bit more than
this just makes me want to take my
makeup off thank y'all so much for
watching this video if you have any
other requests like Hayley I need you to
do this video let me know in the
