start off this fall morning I'm gonna be
moisturizing my face using the Clinique
moisturizing gel it's very important to
make sure your skin stays hydrated
especially around this time of the year
when it's getting colder as a base for
all the makeup I'm going to be applying
on to my face I'm using the Smashbox
primer next I'm going to be using this
milk cooling water stick and this is
like a deep buffer for your under-eye
circles which I obviously need this is
what I've been using for coverage on my
skin lately it's a CC cream by air
Borean and what's really cool about it
is when you put on your skin as white
with those particles in it that pick up
the skin tone of your skin and then like
match it and blend into it to cover it
which i think is like magic it's not
that high coverage which is what I
prefer but what I do like to make sure
it's high coverage is my concealer
because I like to use it to conceal my
under eye bags once again this concealer
is by NARS and I'm just blending it with
this mini Beauty Blender because my dog
ate my big one but I kind of like it
better like it's more detailed if you
know what I mean to set all the makeup
that I just applied to my face I'm gonna
be using the router powder by glossier
this is light but effective at the same
time the glow creme from our Borean is
one of my all-time favorite products
it's like an all-over face illuminator
but I just like to apply it to the
points on my face that I feel like
should be highlighted it adds this
amazing glow and I just love it I'm not
gonna be doing much to my eyebrows
because I've just been enjoying the
natural look lately and I just want to
comb them through just to make sure
they're not sticking out and then set
them with a brow gel with summer no
longer here we're all slowly and sadly
losing your tans
but it's okay because we have bronzer
you can use it to contour to just give
your face an overall more sharper look
or you can actually apply it to like
your cheeks and stuff to get that warm
glow that you had all throughout the
summer again with summer gone we're
slowly losing that pink that the hot
weather would give us but it's okay
we have blush for that too this is the
peach blur by Too Faced it smells
amazing it smells like peaches and cream
so I'm just applying that to my
cheats now that your close up to my face
I'm gonna be putting a little bit of
highlighter right underneath my brow
line to just give it a more sharp clean
look I'm not gonna be going too crazy
with my eyeshadow but I just thought I'd
ask some warm tones to this look so I'm
gonna be applying this shimmery like
light brown color just all over the lid
you can blend it into your crease to
make a look a little bit more natural
I'm gonna be grabbing the slightly
darker shade of brown and applying that
into my crease and just blending it out
to give it a natural smoky look my
eyelash extensions are currently in the
process of falling off so don't mind
them I can't apply any mascara but I'm
putting just a little bit in my bottom
lashes I apply this Noonie lip mask a
couple minutes before I do my lip look
because I want to let my lips be able to
soak in the moisturizer I'm applying
this cream highlighter as a primer for
my powder highlighter I'm going to be
applying afterwards and then I'm also
applying a little bit of cream
highlighter and my inner corners to
brighten up my eye makeup and moving on
I'm gonna be grabbing my glow kit from
Anastasio which is my all-time favorite
highlighter kit you guys know but I
actually used some of the warmer tones
because now that it's fall I just want
experiment with that moving on to lips
I'm choosing the slightly darker shade
then I would usually go for in the
spring or summer time it's my nude
sticks and it has this very soft formula
which I really enjoy and it lasts all
throughout the day so I'm just gonna be
applying that all over my lips and then
I have the same lip pencil in a slightly
lighter shade and I'm just gonna be
applying that into the middle of my lips
to give this highlighted look so my lips
look bigger to see you on all the makeup
I'm gonna be setting it with a setting
spray from Too Faced this is the
completed makeup look I think it's a
very warm toned and soft at the same
time it's not too intense so you could
pretty much wear this look anywhere you
go and I think it's very all natural
next to my morning routine comes my hair
so I'm just gonna be brushing out all
the knots because we are gonna be using
a little bit of heat on it but it's okay
cuz it's not bad for you I promise just
make sure you spray on a little bit of
heat protectant spray you know just to
make sure they're protected so I'm gonna
be using this Bed Head wave a holic tool
and just giving it some time to heat up
and putting some of my hair up in a pony
it's called crimping which was really
trendy in like the 80s or the 90s I
believe so this hairstyle definitely has
all throwback vibes out there so for the
bottom layer I'm not applying that much
pressure cuz I want to focus more on
getting volume instead of shape since
the bottom layers aren't that visible
anyway I press down each time for around
like five or ten seconds for the top
layer I'm gonna be focusing a little bit
more on getting that crimp to look fully
so I'm going to be applying a little bit
more pressure and holding it down for a
little longer
I feel like this looks like what your
hair would look like after keeping your
hair braided overnight and wave a holic
makes it so easy to get this doesn't
even take a lot of time in ceramic
plated so it is not that damaging for
your hair I like to spray on a little
bit of hairspray just to make sure it
lasts a little bit longer and that's my
crimped hair but we're not done yet
because I want to add a little bit more
of a modern twist to this hair look so I
put my hair in a mid Pony and then
pulled at the base of the ponytail to
give it a little bit of volume around
the temple of your head and then I took
out a few pieces to frame my face I
think having it sleek in the front and
then very like poofy and volumous in the
back of such a cute contrast I'm gonna
be perfecting the hair look by adding a
little bit of the smoothing lotion from
bette head and this is the finished hair
look I think it's the perfect mixture of
modern and retro and just like add
something to the fall time to be a
little bit more excited about
lights
with my
all around but I never can</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
