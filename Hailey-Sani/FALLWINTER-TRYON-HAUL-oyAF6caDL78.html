sunny and today I'm back again with
another haul if you're not already make
sure you subscribe and click the bell so
you get notifications every time I
upload which is every Saturday so
today's haul is gonna be a super
affordable winter clothing haul and I'm
partnered up with Zabu for this video
and I know Zach gets a lot of
controversy because people are like it's
a scam or people are like it's really
bad quality I do realize that some of
their products like on their website
they look like Chanel and then you get
them it's like Walmart so that's the
reason why I usually order like 30
things and I eliminate the things that I
know you guys wouldn't like and that I
don't like and I show you guys the ten
things that I really like that I wear
constantly and I think you guys would
like to so I got you girls you can trust
me I know that if you order these parts
on their website you are gonna like them
everything I got will be linked down
below before I'm sorry I'm gonna get a
million questions in the comments saying
where's your shirt from and it's from
I'm Gia just pointing it out there so
yeah they're two let's just start it
with it if you've ever watched my other
alcohols you guys know that I tend to
get a black and a white of the same
thing most of the cases just because I
really like the item and I want to be
able to wear it you know in whatever
scenario so this is crop distressed
sweater there's like just dressing along
the collar line and then also like right
here in the bottom and the sleeves just
an all-around distress it looks really
good on because it has like a wide
collar line so like your collar bones
are very visible it's very feminine but
at the same time a very edgy and I got
the same exact thing in black because
there's two sides to every story what I
think it's a very essential piece to
have in your closet this winter and of
course you can layer it make it look
even cuter if you can't really wear like
cropped stuff where you live moving on
I'm also very obsessed with this so oh
my god I can't even it's a track suit so
sup hands
and a sweatshirt so they're just like
these semi baggy black velvet sweatpants
and like the adidas thing they have the
three stripes going down and it comes
with a matching sweatshirt so it's not
like a zip up it's like a hoodie I feel
like when you wear them together
it's very intense like people are like
whoa is she the mom from you girls
because basically I am next up I have
another white sweater but this one's
like kind of off the shoulder because
it's very baggy and also is very soft
and not thick the sleeves are wide cut
which adds more like a casual feel to it
so all of our material just makes it
feel like high quality I can't think of
any pants that this top wouldn't go with
like jeans no 101 sweatpants casual
moving on I have this turtle knife but
it's a zip up and it's cropped it's
black and white and has stripes so
basically you have eyes too so I don't
really get the point of haul they should
just be a bunch of clothes so people
trying things on like why do I have to
explain it to you you know anyways back
to what I was saying personally when I'm
wearing turtlenecks I feel like
someone's like choking me and it's not a
sensation I like um most of the time so
that's why I like the zipper cuz you're
like breathing essential yeah I
personally wear with the zipper all the
way down but at the same time it still
looks cute if you if you like that
feeling of being choked I'm not judging
anybody
the next winter you might have seen the
Nils alcoholic as she copied me she
about the same thing very like Gigi
Hadid Tommy vibes in this it's super
soft none of the items I've showed you
so far have like that cheap feel to it
which I obviously why would I wear
clothes like that it's also kind of like
stretchy so it's like tight-fitting it
would just like wrap around your figure
and make it look like really hot I like
the nautical vibes the next two things
are my obsession
cuz I've always wanted jackets like
these every time I go to like Topshop or
Zara they would be like $180 and I feel
like keep see you later
but these ones they're really cute it's
this like pink
color jacket it's cut as if it's a
leather jacket but it's actually suede
so it's like very soft and girly at the
same time like the cut just gives it
like an edgy vibe which is like a
combination I really like putting
together in my outfits it has a belt in
the bottom right here and just a bunch
of zippers going all around
so that's the first jacket and then the
second one is the same jacket and just a
light blue color because like I said I
like those pastel lives like that was
nice like people that like deathless is
like she close eventually does that look
shitty to you it's just cute I'm gonna
be traveling a lot this winter break so
I needed to stack up on my jacket here's
another jacket I haven't watched it yet
and the trick was a flue denim jackets
is after you get them washed in like one
or two times and then they just kind of
like de-stress and have like this like
rugged like vintage feel to it like this
looks very proper just with the cut it's
a black denim jacket and then it has
studying all around here and on the
collar very different from the ones I
just showed you it's more like edgy
badass I think know also got this and
what she did was she cropped the jacket
so I might experiment with that because
I really want a bunch of like crop denim
jacket yeah this is very not me so
that's why I bought it because I want to
try something new
it's this super striped like
multicolored but like all these colors
kind of remind me of fall colors again
like not a high-rise turtleneck I can
like deal with these this gives me such
retro feels and I just wanted something
like this to have in my closet
especially to wear with like hugs which
is like my guilty pleasure like I love
eggs
don't judge me please probably the cable
man white jacket boyfriend jeans I'm
just always thinking of outfits when I'm
filming hauls this is another simple
basic piece that I just wanted to have
in my closet so it's just a little
cropped black hoodie but the sleeves are
pretty cool they seem New York on them
and I love New York and they're very
wide cut and super long as you can see
like the sleeves are twice the size of
that
some sweater and I like being obnoxious
with my outfits like if I just slap
someone around with like my sleeves I'll
do it so watch out kids
the last item I really liked didn't fit
me it's this leather black skirt but it
gives me such emotional vibes like the
top cut out right here it almost reminds
me of like a leather jacket in a skirt
like yeah it's really cute I wish it
offend me it's really hot like Oh a hot
skirt a skirt that's hot that was it for
my video guys I hope you enjoyed it
these are just some items that I'm gonna
be playing around with this winter
season
like I said everything from zap oh it's
gonna be link it down below but I think
that's the end of my video I love you
guys so much all the way to pillow and
back brokenhearted you say taking
pictures pictures just to show them to
you bitches bitches so you can make up
