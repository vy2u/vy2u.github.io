say if you're new to my channel make
sure you subscribe because my next video
I mean this video is pretty important -
you're gonna like it but my next video
is gonna be a magnificently gigantic
giveaway so I'm sure you don't want to
miss that so stay tuned for that but
this video is also gonna be really fun I
did something similar to this a little
while ago I stole the style or like got
the look of models off duty and it did
very well you guys really enjoyed it and
always wanted me to keep doing some more
in that video I stole three outfits from
Kai Gerber kendall Jenner and Bella
Hadid this video is gonna be more
towards celebrities in general so I'm
gonna be stealing the style of Selena
Gomez who's a singer slash actress slash
goddess the next outfit that I'm gonna
be recreating is a Haley Baldwin look
I'm obsessed with her she is a model so
I guess it's like a model off-duty look
the next hour I'm gonna be stealing is
from Madison gear she has a really cute
style so I chose an outfit from her
closet obviously all the original
outfits are really pricey but you guys
don't have to worry because most of the
things that I chose are pretty
affordable so you can go buy them
yourself I'm going to be linking all the
items that I use and every single outfit
in the downbar and yeah without further
ado let's jump into the Cydia if I could
describe Selena's style in one word it
would definitely be classy she always
looks so modern and chic and so cute at
the same time in this look I chose to
recreate one of her more casual and cozy
outfits and every single detail in this
outfit pulls the whole look together to
start off this wool jacket that I'm
wearing is from forever 21 and it's very
warm and comfy she had on a pair of the
most perfectly fitting mom jeans and
this one's from Reformation it's a
little bit more in the pricier side but
definitely a lot more cheaper than the
one she was wearing she went with a pair
of old-school shoes so here are some
Oxford's with cutouts on the side and
for her bag she was actually wearing her
coach collaboration that I see her
wearing all the time and it's adorable
for her shirt she was just wearing a
plain black turtleneck this one's from
Brandi super cute and affordable and I
think the accessories in this look of
really make everything work so I'm just
wearing some silver hoops and
a pair of silver Sonny's so in the end
if you add up everything she was wearing
versus what I was wearing her outfit was
almost $2,000 more than sipping wine was
Madison's outfits are definitely a
source of my personal inspiration
because I can really relate to her style
it definitely reflects that laid-back la
vibe starting off with a top I find her
incorporating vintage and a bunch of her
outfits she was wearing a vintage banty
in this one and I'm just wearing this
dark vintage Harley Davidson shirt this
is actually the exact jacket she was
wearing it's an IMG Awan you've probably
seen it it's taking over Instagram I
think it's so adorable I feel like she
steals the jewelry game cuz her arm
candy is always on point I'm wearing my
jeweled chain link bracelet and ring set
and I think she has something similar to
these and I also layered on a bunch of
gold necklaces and I'll make sure to
link everything down below I'm wearing
my cloud glasses even though in her
outfit she was wearing these saline ones
but these I got for 10 dollars from a
kiosk at the Grove I really don't know
how I feel about these sometimes I feel
like they're really dope and other times
I feel like I'm wearing swimming goggles
she had on a pair of leather pants and
here I'm just wearing my coat of Jamie's
from Topshop and she finished the look
with some Nikes I feel like these are a
little bit more cooler because they have
this like leather patch in the back but
they're pretty similar and they would
both look really nice with this outfit
so I didn't end up adding up the jewelry
because she has pieces that cost more
than like $15,000 my outfit was 1,500
dollars less than present and they
looked pretty much identical I aspire to
have hailey Baldwin's closet even though
the price for her average outfit is like
over 5k this was the closest thing I
could find to her Louboutin satin shirt
but it's pretty much the same material
just a slightly different color I look
for triangle hoops for days I finally
found them but they got lost in the mail
so I'm just wearing some silver hoops
she was wearing these really cool Celine
Sunny's and I found a similar pair on
eBay for less than $10 for pants she had
on a pair of light washed blue denim
jeans and I'm just wearing my Levi's
that I thrifted from the Melos Trading
Post you can really see her shoes in the
paparazzi pics so I just paired it with
these leather slides from Steve
at in her bag was a Louis Vuitton
supreme crossbody but mine's a Rebecca
Minkoff I mean they're both reddish so I
guess it kind of works
Haley Baldwin's outfit was the most
expensive out of three but it's
justified because she's wearing two
pieces of Louie Vuitton my recreation
was almost 10 thousand dollars less than
hers thank you guys so much for watching
this video I hope you guys enjoyed it
let me know in the comments if there are
any other celebrities or specific looks
that you want me to recreate in future

might as well just give this video a
thumbs up while you're at it I mean I
love you guys so much all the way to
Prudhoe and back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
