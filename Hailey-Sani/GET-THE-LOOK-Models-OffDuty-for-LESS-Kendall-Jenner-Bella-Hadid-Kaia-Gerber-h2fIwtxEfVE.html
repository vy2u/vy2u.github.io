joined here today with no and she's my
sister you guys probably already know
her she's literally everywhere we
haven't collab in a really long time so
we were like let's collab on a video
together on my channel I'm gonna be
doing a get to look for Manos off duty
in general so I'm gonna be doing like a
makeup a hair and three outfits and on
my channel I'm going to be stealing the
style of Kendall Jenner and I'm also
gonna be sharing three looks and
recreating them for affordable prices
I'm gonna link Nell's channel down below
you're probably already subscribed if
you're not what are you doing that like
sister epromos Oh like and yeah that
further they saw what I've seen on like
Instagram and stuff like when it comes
to makeup
I feel like models that are like
off-duty doing everyday things tend to
go for a more natural look
however they almost always manage to
look flawless especially when it comes
to skin the weak point in my skin is my
dark circles so I try to cover those as
best as I could using some concealer
under my eyes and instead of setting it
with a powder which would mattify my
face I'm gonna use kind of like this
primer but at the same time it's an
all-over face illuminator because models
always have this glowing healthy looking
skin and to achieve that I'm using this
eye Borean glow creme which does the job
pretty well and of course you can't miss
their sky-high cheekbones so to achieve
that I'm gonna be contouring my face a
little using some bronzer going
hand-in-hand with the whole natural
youthful look I feel like models have
been steering away from the whole fleeky
batty eyebrows and instead they're
making a look a lot more youthful and
like baby like by feathering them out
and to get that I'm just using a little
bit of clear brow gel and brushing my
eyebrows up adding on to the glow if you
highlight your inner corners it really
helps brighten up your eyes and then I'm
going in with a powder highlighter on my
cheekbones and then also on my brow bone
I love the way the highlight reflects
off the natural light making you bitter
look like a star models always rock the
whole tip of your nose highlight thing
and makes them look so cute I love this
trend and I'm finishing off with a
little bit of lip balm to get that
smooth plump lip I don't know about you
but I'm super jealous of how models
always have the perfect effortless waves
so I'm gonna be achieving that look
using the bedhead curly pops tourmaline
ceramic wand of course don't forget to
put on some heat protectant so you're
not damaging your hair the barrel is one
and a quarter inches and I feel like the
bigger the barrel the more natural the
waves look I like to hold the barrel in
a downwards angle I feel like the waves
fall a little more naturally this way
and thank God it came with this glove
because I burn my hands at least five
times when I'm curling my hair no joke
so I parted up one half of my hair so I
could curl the bottoms first and then
I'm gonna be letting all of that down so
we can also do the top layer this way
it's more even out and I have all layers
of my hair kind of curled since we are
going for a more natural effortless look
the amount of hair you curl each time
can vary like that's totally fine and
I'm just like grabbing random chunks of
hair from all over my head the reason I
really like the bedhead tourmalines
styling iron is because you don't have
to keep your hair wrapped around the
barrel for too long I think I held each
piece of hair for around 20 seconds so
this way you're minimizing the amount of
time your hair is in contact with heat
which is better for your hair I know it
looks odd and to put together in the
beginning but once I played around with
it and toss it around to find my natural
hair part it looks so pretty I had the
bounciest curls ever this is my favorite
hair product ever and I literally
couldn't live without this and I just
recently discovered it and it's the
bedhead after party styling cream and
you basically put it on your hair and it
makes it shinier and looks more healthy
which who doesn't want that and look at
these like effortless bouncy
natural-looking waves I literally felt
like my hair was done by genican or
something I felt so modelesque but I
also didn't lose my national preference
I've just
this video make sure you watch your
nails it's gonna be linked down below
and if you enjoyed this video don't
forget to give it a big thumbs up and
