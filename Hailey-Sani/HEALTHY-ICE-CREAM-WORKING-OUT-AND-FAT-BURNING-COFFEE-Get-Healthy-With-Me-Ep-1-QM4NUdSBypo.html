like literally two minutes ago but I had
a really nice sleep because I went to
bed at like 11:00 p.m. last night and
that's like the earliest time I've ever
been to bed this summer and I woke up
and it's like 9:30 so that's like 10 and
a half hours of sleep so that's good
because I've been editing like crazy for
the past couple of days and I just
really needed some good sleep and I got
it and so happy and I'm gonna like drink
all this water right now actually more
than this cuz got to stay hydrated
here's a tip if you want to get into the
habit of drinking water when you wake up
usually I like to drink like around half
a liter but here's the thing if you like
wake up and you're like okay this
morning I'm gonna like drink so much
water and you drink like a liter of
water when you're not used to drinking
any water you're gonna feel like you
want to throw up you're not gonna feel
very well so try to do it little by
little that way your body will get used
to drinking water if you want to get
healthy you have to learn that you have
to take baby steps you can't do
everything at once because then your
body is just not going to cooperate with
you and it's probably going to like
corrupt and nomads are happening you
want this to actually work so be patient
be consistent and you'll see amazing
results and you'll feel amazing that's
what we're trying to do here we're
trying to feel amazing and be confident
so now I'm going to make me some coffee
and this is the Java babe burning and
boosting coffee and guys this coffee is
literally my Holy Grail I've been having
it like every morning lately I've been
obsessed with coffee and this coffee is
Rho Basel inning so if you're a babe you
better get this it it says you're hotter
than me and I'm coffee that's really
funny basically it's like a metabolism
booster burns off extra calories and
stuff it has a very nice message it says
she's confident intelligent and full of
poise she takes care of her body and
when she walks into her room people
notice she strives to be her best self
and bring out the best in others she
knows who she is and has the courage to
always be true to herself I really
recommend you try this out I'll link it
down below the coffee jeez ten times
better than like Starbucks or like
normal coffee I feel like it has this
really nice like exotic smell and it
tastes amazing and not only is the
coffee good I really like the message
it's spreading like telling girls to be
confident if you want to get healthy
with me you can just start off with like
doing the simplest things like switching
from normal coffee to like burning and
boosting coffee talking about this
coffee is making me crave it so
goodnight
now
as for breakfast I'm gonna be having a
mono meal of watermelon and I like
having a mono meals because by the way
if you don't know what a Moana meal is
it's a meal where you only eat one thing
so like one type of thing which is a
watermelon in my case and mono meals are
so easy for your body to digest even
though it's watermelon and it's going to
make you bloated for like half an hour
because it has a lot of water in it
which is also good for like getting
water in your body after like half an
hour half an hour your body knows that
the only thing it has to digest is that
one watermelon so we get too used to
digesting watermelon so it like digest
your watermelon really quickly and you
don't get bloated and not only is that
good the watermelon also tastes pretty
good holy heavens look how awesome that
looks
you don't get quit morning workout using
the pump up app let me talk about it
real quick because you guys need to know
how amazing this app really is so this
is what the pump up app looks like right
when you get in if you don't know what
pump app is it's basically like
Instagram for like fitness freaks okay
me and as you can see there's like
progress pictures of people and like
people that worked out things that can
motivate you tips and tricks and how you
can get healthy food ideas meal ideas
healthy recipes and oh my god that looks
really yummy this is my account um as
you can see I go running quite a lot and
this is where like I track some of my
pump up workouts everybody on here is so
nice so if you're not happy with your
body and you post a picture of yourself
here like you will literally get zero
negative comments everybody here is so
supportive it's such a positive
community where you will not get judged
and nobody will be like oh my god girl
you're too thin or you need to lose
weight nobody will say that everybody
will just be like I'm so proud of you
keep doing what you're doing everybody
on here is trying to feel best way that
they can about themselves and they all
aspire to be healthy and fit and happy
in their own body and pump up also
creates customized workouts for you and
I'm gonna like do a quick workout so
these are like the workouts that I
usually do but I want to like add a new
one just so you guys get the idea of how
you do it so you can pick whichever you
want to do I'm pretty intermediate me
advanced but today I want to do like a
quick workout so I'm just going to click
on 15 minute I'm at home you can like
pick whatever equipment you have so that
it's super customizable and you pick
whichever part of your body you want to
tell so right now I really want to tone
my core my lower body of course are
getting conditioning circuit and it just
literally builds a workout for you
prompt up it's like a free personal
trainer you don't have to like pay so
much money to go to the gym like hire a
personal trainer um so it shows you all
the things that you're going to do and
how long you have to do them for and I'm
my workout right now
I decided to start this new series where
you guys get to get healthy with me
because obviously I'm really passionate
about like getting healthy and like
fitness and like eating right and food
and I know some of you are like really
interested and you guys have a bunch of
questions to ask me about like how I
started my fitness journey etc and I
thought I'd do the series to motivate
myself and feel better about myself and
also help you guys along the way so I
could maybe motivate some of you to get
healthy with me
I actually got inspired to do this by
essena o'neill so I actually put some
bananas in the freezer overnight so they
could freeze I want to try out this new
thing where you like put frozen fruits
in the blender and apparently you get
some really nice ice cream all natural
stuff so I'm gonna try it out see how it
goes see if I like it share it with you
they're really hard doing all this with
one hand like whoa yeah I think I need
to add some liquids in there oh my god
it's so annoying okay so apparently the
reason it wasn't working is because I
didn't close it well so the blending
from stupid hi guys
I want to put like these walnuts in here
for protein and good fats and also as a
nice little crunchy topping let's
pretend it's sprinkles to be honest I
think walnuts tastes better than
sprinkles to the taste test I think I
just found my new favorite food in here
there's only like bananas so it's like
all natural and it tastes just like ice
cream like I want to share a picture of
the ice cream on pump up okay
look at me I'm Margo say tada I thought
I'd enjoy my ice cream outside so this
is a view and well actually this is the
real view my dogs like playing with the
next-door neighbor's dog okay good be
free
hi hi in the boy okay so I got bored
outside so I'm going to go inside now
I'm such an Internet kid so I just
finished my ice-cream and I'm watching a
Cena's get healthy with me because
they're just so amazing she is such an
inspirational human being I'll link her
channel down below she's literally a
goddess you decide to come to Mel
because he acted by her mom a birthday
present because it's her birthday
tomorrow
yay and we're at Starbucks right now you
got the lemon vanilla Frappuccino that
new taste test
I have helium but I do I want to taste
it I didn't get Starbucks because
Starbucks is filled with disgusting
sugars
we're good tastes like a lemon here
Instagram goals so my mom's we went to
the movies we watched the movie no
escape it was pretty good um and now
we're gonna go to the supermarket pick
up a few things because we don't have
like some seats so don't worry
basically after the salad I didn't eat
anything else I don't know what we're
gonna have for dinner it's like a
snowball so I got some peanut butter
dried apricots peaches tomato puree
because it's just really simple for like
making vegetable dishes I got some dried
mulberries just some plain oats bananas
about one mango because I've never had a
mango before because like one mango cost
seven bucks in Turkey so it's pretty
ridiculous oh I guess we got another
peanut butter I got some fruit yogurt
frozen raspberries because they don't
sell fresh raspberries here and some
moves ly which has like basically oats
and like a bunch of dried fruits and
yeah everything is pretty healthy and
maybe not so much the peanut butter but
besides that I think we're good I forgot
to show you these I got some boiled
chickpeas and bake fees for protein and
like salads are like just on their own
with a side of vegetables
