here and today I'm gonna be filming a
how I edit my Instagram pictures because
for the past like ever since summer
started basically I've been kind of like
putting effort into my theme and I kind
of like the way it look and a lot of you
have been leaving comments asking me
what filters do you use in case someone
how am i screen photos video so always
think to do what you guys want me to do
so this is what my Instagram looks like
it's a Haley sunny right here you can
see I have a lot of like summery
pictures and then I'm slowly making it
go into fall like I have some pics from
Europe and like photo shoots and selfie
Coachella it's a fun time my Instagram
is a fun time you should definitely
follow me on there if you do hashtag
help from these are the apps that I
usually use to edit my photos but to be
honest I only use vsco to add like
filters and then I'll use Pixar if
there's like a piece of hair that I want
to like erase or you know things like
that my favorite thing about visco is
the fact that like you can literally
upload your pictures so it looks like
your Instagram so you'll see if it goes
with your theme I uploaded four pictures
right here and I'm gonna be editing all
four of them in the four different
styles that I usually use to edit my
pictures so starting off with this one I
have like all the filters and that's
because my sister like somehow managed
to download all of them for free I
literally don't know how she did that
but she did it because she's like hacker
she's a hacker yeah just getting FBI for
this picture I chose to edit it with
onine which adds like a warmer chant
that I really like so I turn it down a
little and then what I do is my
isn't really that bright so I usually
turn now that exposure like a ram to I
almost always make my contrast go one up
then I sharpen it a little so it's like
more HD all about that 4k HD GoPro life
we're missing for literally all my
pictures I feel like this is like a
trick this is a trick if you want your
photos to like look more professional to
add like definition to the photo and
like shadows I don't know how to say
that but like vignette it's basically
like putting a black shadow around your
picture and I feel like that works
really well so I usually do that like
four or five and then I don't look like
that green thing in here so definitely
crop that then to add like that rusty
effect because this photo like has that
I like make the grain go up a few knots
and yeah this is what it look like so
this is before and after moving on when
I edit my photos in black and white
there's always one specific way that I
use and that filter is b5 so it adds
this effect and again what I like to do
is make the exposure go down I think we
do like one and the contrast don't wrong
jump again vignette like four and then a
little bit of grain and what I it
basically adds like that same like rusty
film camera effect for like my summary
photos like the ones with like the beach
and like to see you guys are always like
how to make that filter like how are the
color is always so bright and like pop
in so I picked this picture and I use oh
for for this but what I do is I higher
the exposure this time so like around
that much and then add contrast and then
I always add like a little bit of
saturation to get like that blue effect
wait I'm going to make I'm going to make
the contrast go down to one and then I
lower the temperature to like give that
blue tint to the ocean and then I'll
make the vignette to
and it'll look like this but I have a
trick so I say that onto my camera roll
and then I go to Instagram at Instagram
actually has this effect called like the
color around Ian and I like add that and
lower it a little and look at that look
how beautiful it makes the picture like
it makes the colors pop and adds like
that really pretty tape to the photo so
I don't like underestimate Instagram
filters like they can be really good
sometimes so I'm going to be editing
this selfie and again I'm going to use
Oh 4 and this already
adds like basically of the effect that I
always want but it's just like too much
so what I do is lower down that filter
to like a six again vignette that - like
a 1 sharpen and it'll look like this as
you can see I really don't do much
because I like to keep my selfies like
pretty natural those are all the
pictures of me editing for you guys
today this is what it looks like blah
blah go down to down comment down below
which photo you think I should post next
and if you think you have a feed that's
popping comment down your user name and
I'll follow you and I love you guys so
much
all the way so Pluto bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
