upload your whole closet onto here I
mean you can if you want you or like the
things that you like in your closet and
when you're going shopping and you want
to buy stuff you can like check out your
closet to see what you can like pair of
those items that you want to buy with I
I use it for like a different thing as
you guys know I go to the USA like at
least once a year and when I'm there I
obviously go on a shopping spree and I
like to like put pictures of all the
things that I wanted by I actually have
like a shelf it's really cool it's
basically like a little mini like
library there's like shelves on here and
you are always asked me like Hayley what

I definitely lack in the height
Department Lynette and 39 ask would you
ever get a pixie haircut yeah there's a
little story I'll share with you when I
was like in the second and third grade I
used to go skiing every weekend for like
the whole year you might be wondering
like how to like find a place to ski I
still live in Dubai and they have like a
freaking mountain in a mall so I just
take a really big mountain working
really go professional skiing pleased to
go there every weekend and get skiing
lessons winter skiing you all basically
have a helmet on
and once this teacher said boy coming
here and I was like like who is he
talking to because obviously I'm not a
boy and he was like yeah you you come
here boy and I was like I'm excuse me
sir I'm a girl and he's like don't joke
with me and I was like what is this man
steak I'm a frigging girl and then I
like showed him some of my hair and he
was like oh I'm so sorry honey I didn't
know and ever since then I have swear it
to my life that I will never get a pixie
haircut because I will look like a boy
kyla and if asked can you speak good
Turkish so yes say something and tell us
where you learn it from please I love
you I love you too and I didn't like
learn Turkish I was born with the
language because obviously I was born in
Turkey
my parents are Turkish my whole family's
Turkish I learn Turkish naturally and
Mayon Turkish is pretty good that's
sending it because five Turkish I mean
duh it's at eight kids ask what did you
do to get your stomach flat in your
fitness video you were you were talking
about how you got belly fat but I can't
see it okay I never really had belly fat
I always had like a big stomach because
I used to eat a lot and my stomach used
to get really bloated I still need a lot
so nothing has changed but a lot of you
asked me how I had a flatter stomach now
and basically I don't eat really late
anymore I used to like have dinner at 9
o'clock at night and I used to obviously
wake up with like a big fat stomach in
the morning
and would be like really upset be like
oh my I have a belly fat but no I used
to get really bloated so now I drink a
lot of water which obviously reduces
bloating and I don't eat late at night
you FAMAS as where do you plan on living
when you move to the US and we're gonna
move to California probably not like
downtown LA because it's really
expensive but somewhere close to LA
maybe like Newport Beach or like Laguna
Beach you're like Irvine I don't know
what's somewhere there Neffe asks would
you visit Greece and yes I go to Greece
like 10 times in the summer comment down
below if you're from Korea maybe
actually have a meet-up there maybe like
one person would show up and we could
like go to the beach I'm gonna go like
to the mainland I'm also going to be
visiting all the islands like macness
Santorini Athens everywhere some of what
else I can't think of any more mintage
hurdles asking what sound does a unicorn
make and I really like this question
because I have no idea
I'm definite something like magical
because it's a unicorn so I don't think
okay like I don't think it would make a
sound like that I think would be
majestic like
oh look at that I have absolutely no
idea
Casa de Julio asked opinion on gay
marriage and as you guys know if you
don't want some fool media or watch the
news gay marriage was legalized in the
USA and funny thing actually saw a few
tweets on Twitter saying like okay like
gay marriage is like legalized in USA
I'm moving Canada so I'm like really and
considered people we're like tweeting
that and what's funny is that gay
marriage is like legal in Canada anyway
so like what do you do with your life I
totally support it if you're gay and you
want to marry the person that you love
go ahead and nobody should be stopped
you and yeah and covered - well we I
have been really bad at this as if your
name is a turd I just don't understand
how it's Haley and I hope that made
sense I got this question over 50 times
guys I was born with the name a dude
because I was born from a Turkish am
these so obviously they're going to name
their child a Turkish name I mean if
you're America and your parents are
going to like name you something Indian
aren't they unless you're saying really
but he's on the market anyway and then I
moved I said my name is a dude
but since there's like a special sound
of that name a lot of like American or
British people can't pronounce it they
hate the ATO so they were like a loo AOL
and at one point I got used to the fact
that my name was a Lou and then one day
I said a loo and a friend of mine
misunderstood it she was like hailey so
then it just stuck to me and then
everybody started calling me Haley and
now I'm here and I'm Haley and it's kind
of like my second name now you Rosa as
what is the weirdest sentence you have
heard someone say okay another story
time and this actually happened tomorrow
we were at the beach and there was like
there was three people in the water
two of them were flirting and the girl's
friend was kind of like third-wheeling
and what's really funny is that those
two people are flirting did not speak
the same language one was German and one
was Turkish so her third Wieland friend
was kind of kept on translating what
they were saying back and forth and it
was like so funny
and the third-wheeling friend was like
she was like dying laughing and she said
oh my god laughing so much I can feel
myself peeing right now and I'm totally
not against like paying in the ocean
because I mean big that ocean like all
your poo gets sent there by the way if
you didn't know um but like the fact
that she said that out loud in the beach
it just it was kind of funny you know
and me and my sister we were just like
we were laughing so hard it was it was a
great time
Marie J 7:21 asked a $2.00 room a quote
from say oui and that basically means
are you in a friend school and to
do Oh appreciate that then I'll see you
I love you to capture the moment s ask
what is the most random dream that you
have ever had and ever since jennxpenn
to that video I have been writing down
my dreams the first one is there was a
fire in my school and I lost my shoe
then Jessica gave me her shoe we left
the school we saw a woman getting
shredded in her car's engine we were in
Africa and my grandma was also there I
saw giraffes mom want to eat ice cream
we've got on a boat slash car we were
going up a cliff the cars and
work so it starts slipping backwards we
fell into the water and laugh at the end
and I literally wrote stuff by the m m
ER truss key as this may be a little
touchy but my friend is cutting and I'm
trying to help her what should I do okay
first of all thanks for like asking for
my advice okay so if she's cutting then
there's probably something like really
bothering her that pusher to that point
of wanting to hurt herself try to be
with her a lot but if there's something
that really hurts her try to like get
her to open up to you maybe she'll wife
share some things that's really wrong
with her life and you can get like
actual help maybe you can write like
stay strong on your wrist and every time
she looks on her wrists she'll like just
remember that she should say strong and
tell her that it will go away and it's
not worth there right now whatever is
bothering her will go away eventually
all she has to do is give it time I hope
everything gets better for your friend
and good luck so yeah again we have come
to the end of a Q&amp;amp;A video and these two
videos literally take five minutes to
film so sorry if it was like really long
I just like talking a lot and not only
thirsty
