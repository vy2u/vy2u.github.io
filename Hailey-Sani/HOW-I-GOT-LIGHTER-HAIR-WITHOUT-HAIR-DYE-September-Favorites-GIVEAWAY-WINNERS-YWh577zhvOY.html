doing my September favorites but I don't
wanna like say this is like this
September favorites because these are
some things that I've been using for a
couple months now at least some of them
are and sorry the lightness seems a
little gloomy it's actually really
cloudy outside and I'm pretty sure it's
gonna rain soon I just said you pick a
day where the weather would match my
personality
no I'm kidding I'm actually in a great
mood today because I just had like a spa
day like I don't want to like really
call it a like a spa day because all I
really didn't want to put on a courtship
and shave my legs but you know how it
feels when you shave your legs go
without further ado let's jump into the
video so my first favorite is actually
an app and you guys know there is always
always and up in my monthly favourites
videos this month is tax fire tags PI
tags tag tags three words to describe
this app would be shareable shoppable
and profitable and I like these words
because shareable it means that I get to
share it with you guys
and the same for one of my favorite
leagues shoppable um hello unlike Blair
Waldorf deep inside and profitable
because everybody likes money so it's
basically an operating post pictures of
anything you like clothing jewelry
accessories tech I'm trying to think of
some more things in this world of
pillows I don't know if you post pillows
basically fashion and when you post it
you put a tag on it
tags fire tags that means that anybody
that's you the photo and like sees the
idea and they're like Newton Bass cute
there's a tag on it
I must click on the text so I can see
how much it cost and then they click on
the ten
what can I talk and then they click on
the tag and there's the price where you
can buy it and if they do decide to buy
it you get a commission that goes in
your pocket but probably not in your
pocket but somewhere in your bag yeah
share it well because you can share it
on like Twitter Facebook who uses
Facebook I don't even know Pinterest and
Shop the pool because if you're in the
mood for shopping you can go in there
find some cute things you can
instantly by it and you go directly into
that store and you buy it from there and
the person that posted the photo of that
is the Commission so you're like
basically helping us out my username is
berry pink lips make sure you go and
follow me I posted 20 things and some of
those things are actually gonna be
favorites that are in this video so if
you watch this video and decide you want
to purchase one of my favorites it will
be on there so yeah that's basically my
first favorite task fire make sure you
go download it I'll have a link down
below moving on to my next favorite so
my next favorite I'm actually wearing
right now this is the Daniel Wellington
watch in the classic like black one that
pretty much you see everywhere ooh
change appear stylist are not sorry I'm
totally in love with this watch guys it
is so minimalistic it is such good
quality because it's a leather and I
love the detailing it is very simple and
it goes with everything and you know we
just gotta have one good one
and I have a peachy bird and I have a
15% off promo code for you that will be
linked down below so you're welcome and
I definitely recommend you check it out
if you want to watch moving onto some
Beauty favorites I have some I wrap
stuff in this video because the products
that help me achieve someone's make them
look more acceptable still not proud of
them was the Too Faced brown and me kit
and it comes with this beautiful lady
with an on fleek around what it goes and
then we open it there's the step-by-step
tutorial on how you can get your brows
on fleek and Elise it's supposed to be
doing that I don't know you be the judge
of my eyebrows the thing that helped me
wear these stencils do you like sticking
on your eyebrow and like they like help
you like oh yeah I basically use them
for this it's the brunette eyebrow
powder that I use basically if you want
to fix your eyebrows get this kit take
it from a sister that struggled so long
it will change your life by this should
be killed and after that I used my pitch
and wild make it clear brow and lash
mascara
and basically any clear mascara will do
this was just really affordable in hell
my eyebrows together so I'm gonna look
it moving on to a hair product of a love
and hate relationship with this hair
product is the extra lawn Pauling's
hair line right okay okay if you realize
my hair has gotten like so much lighter
especially on the end and like up here
girl you just like I sprayed this extra
blonde I thought that if I had some like
nice like blonde hair like frames next
face it would like make me look like I
had lighter hair all around I actually
hate the bits up here that are like
blonde like what are you like what are
you are you kidding like students of
hair I actually end up really liking
like that and forth but it made my hair
like really did if you want to get your
hair two or three shades lighter I
definitely recommend this it adds a good
texture to your hair but why are you
using this I also recommend you use a
deep conditioning mask because it does
leave your hair very dry I'll link it
down below where you can buy it online
but before I'm going to the u.s. I
definitely want to like do something to
change up my hair if you have any like
hairstyles that you think would like
match my hair tweet them to me
moving on to it's a perfume so this is
the vanilla body mists from the body
shop and it's it smells good
it smells like the purest form of
vanilla you can never find you every
would aspire to be one of those people
that's not really good and they're kind
to everybody because I want to be one of
those people moving on to my last Beauty
favorite comment down a little waterfall
a huge store watching you the real MVP
this is the New York City no color
I always thought anyways he stood for
New York City NYC skyrise a length
mascara I like my eyelashes with law I
just like them thing a lot quantity wise
law anymore it's not what it says and
it's cheap cuz your girls broke now we
have come to my favorite part of this
video which is a random favorite so my
book favorite for this month was the
main Hunter series this is the third
book and I just finished it yesterday it
looked like I had a pig attack I was
having a midlife crisis reading this
James Dashner what have you done my
grandma was like are you okay lots of
ups and downs that's why I like it I
like to live on the edge if you're one
of those people that are like oh my gosh
nice runners like the same thing with
the Hunger Games
chef it's so weird how this book is like
science fiction obviously but it's so
possible for everything in here to
happen like literally this story can
actually be a reality in like 100 years
some players global warm things and my
last but definitely not least favorite
is missing August and September like the
best months of the year produce twice

dying inside my favorite song from the
beauty behind Matt this album was
prisoner beat Devon Del Rey is my cream
I like to do we every single song

song is probably castle it's that 3 a.m.
