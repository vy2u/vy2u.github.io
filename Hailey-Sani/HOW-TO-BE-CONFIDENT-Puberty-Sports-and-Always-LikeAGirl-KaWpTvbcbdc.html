I'm gonna be filming a video on
confidence and especially confidence in
girls when they're going through puberty
or if you're just going through puberty
I actually teamed up with always to
present this video to you guys because I
think this video is going to have a
really good message so you've probably
seen the always videos going around
YouTube the one I'm gonna be talking
about today is gonna be called the
always hash tag like a girl keep playing
video I'll link it down below and I
definitely recommend you watch that
before you continue watching this video
it was a one-minute video talking about
how some young girls felt like they
couldn't excel in their sports who's
people around them were bringing them
down or they were telling that they
weren't good enough to do it and how
that's totally wrong it does not have to
be like that whatsoever they can excel
in sports they can win medals they can
do sports that or refer to as girl
sports coz there should be no such thing
as a girl or a guy sport if you want to
do something don't want anything stop
you from doing that I want to have like
a girl - girl talk with you especially
focusing on puberty and how it'll affect
your sport nothing is wrong
puberty is the most natural thing and
what I hate about puberty which I went
through as well is that it's such a
taboo topic in our society it's almost
like people are afraid of mentioning or
afraid to talk about it I feel like that
really negatively effects girls going
through puberty because they don't hear
anyone around them talking about it they
automatically assume that it's not
common so when they do start seeing
changes in their own body when they get
to a certain age they're like wait what
is this is this normal is everyone going
through this so they feel kind of left
out like they're the only one going
through it but I just want to be here to
tell you guys that it's totally normal
everyone goes through a it's one of
those natural things that happen to
girls and even guys and I feel like you
and I should change that little girl
shouldn't feel weird and you have so
much pressure on yourself already
because your body is changing and you're
going up you're getting more
responsibilities and on top of that when
you have a sport to deal with and people
are telling you that you're a girl
you're not good enough girls can't do
the sport you're like okay like I'm not
gonna do this for then they think the
easiest solution to get rid of all their
pollens is like putting their sport at
such a vulnerable point in their lives
when girls are doing sports and sports
are obviously a competitive area on top
of that they have to compete against
guys and other girls and they're like oh
my god what is going on basically you
feel like it you're not good enough
you're just this weird girl going
through this weird thing called puberty
which no one else seems to be going
through and seven out of ten girls quit
their sport when they get to puberty and
by the time they reach the age of
seventeen which is almost towards the
end of puberty fifty one percent of
girls have already quit their sport
going through puberty is hard if your
sport is swimming you're like how do I
swim that if you're running you're like
how do I run with cramps so they feel
like the best solution is getting rid of
their sport but it's kind of like the
opposite I feel like sports build your
confidence to the very max when you're
doing the sport it doesn't really matter
if you're winning or not if you're doing
something that you enjoy doing then that
makes you feel good about yourself you
can literally do anything you want to
you cannot let anyone around you tell
you you can't I hate the fact that
sports are labeled as oh that's a girl
sport or that's not a sport at all
that's a guy sport girls can't play
football guys can't do ballet
cheerleading isn't a sport what even is
dance as if it's not enough we're
labeling each other now we have to start
labeling the sports we do I didn't dance
all middle school in ninth grade and
every time someone would ask me hey what
score do you I'd be like dance I didn't
feel like dance that's not a sport
jumping around is not a sport do they
know how many hours we'd spend at the
studio and her knees would be bruised
and her feet would have blisters and
would be in so much pain and here you
are telling me that what I'm doing is
jumping around and it's not a sport but
lucky for me that never really stopped
me from doing what I
to do excuse you I feel confident doing
this I like doing this I have fun doing
this as girls we have to realize that we
have to stick together because there's
already so many people around us trying
to tear us down and telling us no but
you're here to tell them yes you can do
it you can do whatever you want the
feeling I get after a good workout which
is my sport is irreplaceable I feel
strong I feel confident I feel like I
can achieve anything I want and I feel
good at myself I feel so happy so if
you're a young girl watching this going
through puberty or thinking about
quitting your sport because of puberty
I'm gonna tell you no I interviewed a
few girls that go to my school that do
sports and I asked them what their
opinion was on this topic
puberty affected me during cross-country
because all my coaches are guys so if
you get like period cramps while you're
running and things like that you just
have to push through and they won't
understand and let you start over all my
body was going through a very hard
process playing sports helped me
overcome Huberty puberty is hard
especially when you're dealing with your
girl issues it makes competing in a
sport or performing in a sport harder
especially if you have male coaches and
they don't understand I don't actually
really have any role models because I
think that in running a lot of the men
are highlighted a lot more than the
women my favorite thing about doing
cross-country is definitely the social
aspect I think that no matter how great
you are or how much you suck it's being
with your friends that motivate you to
do the best that you can always do when
you're playing at 4 it's just you in the
ball and like leave everything behind
and I just play focus on me and I have
fun doing this sport makes me feel a lot
more confident because since I'm running
everyday I have a lot more body
confidence and knowing that I'm actually
working out especially in this society
where everyone is pressured to work out
and be thin and eat healthy I think that
this court gives me more towards and not
in an unhealthy way definitely not like
thinking about it from a young age like
boys like their baby rooms are like
decorated footballs and everything boys
are so encouraged to do sports and girls
are just you know they're society
definitely does not encourage girls to
play sports they do not make as much
money as a
I really hope that this changes over
time because girls are as good as guys
playing sports thank them so much for
taking the time to be a part of this
video to help you guys there are so many
people around you that are willing to
help you if you only just tell them just
talk to them 67% of girls say that
society does not encourage them to play
sports and an important thing such as
sports should not be taken away from you
because you're told you can't because
you can I'm here to tell you you can and
I want you to tell yourself that you can
too I love you so much all the way to
Pluto and back I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
