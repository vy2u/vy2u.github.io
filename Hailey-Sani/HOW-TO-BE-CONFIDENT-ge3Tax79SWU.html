you looked in the mirror and smiled
every time because you like what you see
not just physically because you like the
person that you've become and don't do
this to impress others and okay hi guys
its hailey here and yes I did chop ten
inches off my hair but it was for a good
cause I actually donated all my hair I
was actually not planning it for to be
this short the lady lied and since I cut
my hair I kind of felt a little
self-conscious at first cuz that was
like only going on like my hair short
what our people are gonna think and
that's why I came up with this video
idea I'm going to be sharing my tips and
tricks that worked for me that will
definitely impact your life in a
positive way and help you grow out of
that self-consciousness that might just
really be like bugging you we all
probably know a couple people that just
like turn heads when they walk into a
room either every boy wants to date them
or every girl wants to be their friend
everyone just loves and admires and
aspires to be that one girl that you're
like oh my god like I wish I could be
like her she's so bubbly and
self-confident the only reason that
person is like that is because they're
100% in peace with themselves so that
basically means that they love
themselves and I know you hear this
every day like don't forget to love
yourself don't care what others think
just love yourself and you're like okay
but like how like how how does one step
out of this place in their lives where
they're just like like everything seems
like they're going downhill for them
they don't like certain parts of their
face or like certain parts of their body
they're just like self-conscious about
it how does one step out of that zone
and and step into a more positive
confident state of mind I keep being
told that I should love myself but no
one is telling me how I can possibly
achieve that and to do that you have to
realize that everything around you is
temporary even the house that you live
in the life that you're living in high
school your friends right now there will
be certain periods of times in your life
when everything around you changes the
place you live in the house you live in
the people that you're friends with but
there's one thing that's always gonna
stay the same and that's yourself you're
literally stuck with yourself forever if
you don't like a certain part of your
body
there's no way that you can get rid of
it unless you get plastic surgery but
sometimes things you can't change and
you can't get over so you have to learn
to live with them for the rest of your
life because they're not gonna go away I
see this all the time in my videos I
don't like my nose what do I do with it
honestly a plastic surgery like which is
probably not gonna happen in like so
many years or maybe it's never gonna
happen but for now I'm stuck with it so
I have to learn to make the best out of
it I have a friend called Astro and the
other day she was like I was complaining
I was like oh my god like my nose is
like so bleak and she was like stop it
like your nose is what makes you unique
if we all had perfect noses and perfect
features we would all look like each
other so it's what makes us different
it's what makes us unique that counts
and I just took a step back and I was
like damn girl you write the most
important thing is you and your
mentalities you have to learn to adapt
to a more positive lifestyle and I don't
mean like okay let's all go do some yoga
and read inspirational quotes all day
long yay that's okay that's just
unrealistic but I like to think that
whatever you radiate will just come back
to you so if you radiate positive vibes
and kindness it will all come back to
you so maybe you're just like okay let
me just be a more positive person but
how how do I realize that I am the most
important thing in my life there are
actual physical steps because personally
for me it wasn't like okay I'm gonna
like mentally like change the way I
think it just didn't work for me that
way so I had to actually do physical
things like physical changes that would
help change my mentality too so the
first thing that I did was I caught
myself criticizing myself so I take that
criticize a ssin is that a word
and I found a more positive thing to it
so like oh I can literally smell with my
nose I can breathe with my nose I'm
alive because I can breathe with my nose
thanks nose and the number one thing
that you have to do to adapt to a more
positive lifestyle is to remove all
negativity from your life I'm talking
about toxic friends not just friends all
kinds of relationships I had friends
that I felt like I had to impress every
time I met up with them friends that
judge you or like question what you do
and make you question yourself friends
are supposed to push you to do better
and supposed to inspire you to become a
better
person if friends are bringing you down
then they're not real friends after you
leave you shouldn't be exhausted trying
to pretend to be something you're not
I learned to respect others and be kind
because you get treated how you treat
people start off with like a simple
thing like okay I'm gonna compliment at
least five people every day
that way you'll train yourself to see
the positive qualities of others and get
treated with respect yourself and others
might be respecting you but you have to
know that you have to respect yourself
too do you ever think back to those
moments where you cringe and you get mad
at yourself because you didn't respect
yourself enough to stand up for yourself
if a boys being a funk boy like you
could be like you are being one leave I
know so many friends that are like oh
yeah he's being a boy but like I'm
a nice person like honey you don't have
to be nice to people that treat you like
that I get so mad when like random
people are like being rude to girls
unrespectful and girls don't do anything
about it and when I ask them like why
didn't you do anything about it they're
just like I just didn't want to be rude
or I didn't want to be in an
uncomfortable situation if they're
making you feel uncomfortable they
deserve to feel like that right back
you don't need validation from others
you literally only need your own
validation for yourself your own opinion
on yourself is the only opinion that
counts one thing I did is I dress in a
way that made me feel more powerful and
that doesn't mean I wore my armor and
suit and walked around with my little
gun no I didn't do that I simply dress
in a way that made me feel good when you
dress in a way that you know you look
good and you know your outfit is slaying
and you're comfortable in it you won't
feel unconscious and just constantly be
like oh my god like I just bought these
pair of shorts but I don't know how I
look in them this is something that
really helped and I unfollowed people on
Instagram Tumblr Twitter one of those
people was Alexis red because every time
I saw one of her pictures on my
Instagram feed I would always just feel
bad because I'd compare myself to her
constantly like there was just this
point in my life like okay like what am
i doing to myself I'm literally putting
myself in a bad mood on purpose
and I unfollowed her but then I learned
to realize that I have to stop comparing
myself to others I just have to compare
myself to I was yesterday did I improve
from what I was yesterday and once I
learned to not compare myself
to others I followed her right back and
now she motivates me to do better
because she's a gorgeous girl she has
like this Fit Body and I know she works
hard for it I just learned to get
motivated by her and my final point is
your body is literally your home you
live in it till the day you die so if
you didn't like your house would you
throw rocks at it would you break
windows no you'd go to the Home Depot
and buy some paint and work on it that's
what you should do to your body instead
of wrecking it down because you're
unhappy try to fill it up and make it a
more positive place for yourself so
that's it for this video guys I hope you
guys enjoyed it and I hope I could help
you dress like you love it act like you
mean it what am I saying
I love you all so much all the way to
Pluto and back bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
