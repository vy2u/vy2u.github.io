surreal being happy is in your hands
under your control at this moment right
now there are two words that I think are
magic the mistake and saying I want to
be happy is and how is it going to
happen you may ask hey guys it's hailey
sunny here and I just feel really good
today with 20:18 here and everything and
everybody's on this new vibe everyone's
talking about how good they feel this
year's gonna be and that's kind of crazy
because like 2017 was a rough year I
haven't sat down and like poured my mind
out about a certain topic in a minute
and everything kind of started when I
started reading this book called the law
of attraction some of you might be
familiar with it some of you might be
like love would no matter what goes
through your head when I say the law of
attraction I'm just gonna clarify kind
of what I feel like it is and how it's
been working for me I originally started
reading the book and then switched to
listening to it on audible I know you
don't live under a rock and you probably
know what audible is it's basically a
platform where you can listen to books
instead of reading them it's really
chilly you can listen to it like in your
car when you're driving places so it's
not like you're wasting your time it's
kind of sad for me to see that the
incline we have in like being educated
and cultured is very steep and I feel
like we're the new generation we should
be kind of making that go up and
especially just like for yourself when
your knowledge is more deep than just
what you see on Twitter and Instagram
you're interesting you're a better you
that's why I think like even if you
don't physically like reading this is
like a good option because this year you
should really try to like up your game
in becoming more aware of things so I do
have a URL is audible.com slash Haley
Sonny H AI l√º AI sa ni if you're on your
phone right now you can just text Haley
Sonny - 500 - 500 which I feel like is
an easier option and your membership
will start automatically your first
month is gonna be a 30-day trial so if
what I'm gonna talk about that I've
learned about in this book interest you
you should hop on that bandwagon see if
you like it by like listening to it and
let me know they have tons of like
personal development books that I think
would also be relevant to what I'm gonna
be talking
now in a minute yeah it's audible.com
slash Haley sunny I'll link it down
below to and now we can move on to what
this law of attraction book is really
about what I'm about to dive into it
seems so surreal and almost supernatural
not to be like cheesy or anything but I
literally feel like it's magic and I'm a
realist so I'm very like I only believe
what I see does this pen annoying you
guys I just feel more like you know a
teacher a professor I'm about to teach
you how to be happy
usually when people are asked what's
your ultimate goal in life or where do
you see yourself in five years
I feel like a really common answer is I
just want to be happy which is great cuz
like I feel like happiness something
very valuable but the mistake and saying
I want to be happy is classifying
happiness as like a destination
somewhere you have to go through a path
to get to when in reality happiness
isn't something like Nirvana that you're
gonna reach out of nowhere or you're
gonna like itchy some of your goals and
you're gonna like become happy you know
you have to like pass over a barrier to
get there it's really not like that at
all happiness is a feeling it's a state
of mind it's a state of being it's not a
location saying I want to be happy in
ten years means you're not happy right
now and ten years is a hell of a long
time to wait before you get there so I
kind of wanted to like break that
stereotype of like getting to happiness
because being happy is in your hands
under your control at this moment right
now you can switch into being happy like
that in a second and the tips I'm about
to tell you aren't gonna be demotivating
so it's not gonna be like you need to
like find yourself you need to work hard
and become successful and then you'll be
happy no these are things you can do
tonight you can do them tomorrow you can
do them in ten minutes and they're gonna
flip your life around only if you give
me your full trust and attention well
these things actually happen for those
of you that just found me like randomly
and this is the first video you're
watching of mine and first I'm seeing my
face um I know it's gonna be a little
harder to convince you guys since I'm a
complete stranger on a 2d screen for you
but you click on this video there's
probably a reason you clicked on it and
I'm willing to help you you're either
gonna leave this video with your
I've changed or you're gonna leave this
video saying what the hell is this
cuckoo ladies saying so there are two
words that I think are magic magic as in
like mirror mirror on the wall you might
not believe in genie in a bottle but I
think these two words hold that power
the words I am I practiced it myself and
I feel like every time you say I am some
kind of genie a bottle shows up
invisible you can't see you obviously I
mean like supernatural but not that
supernatural you know we're not in
oullette and every time you say those
words I feel like these like mystical
doors open you go into a parallel
universe and every time you say that
your wish becomes granted because when
you say I am you the most powerful being
and your reality are declaring whatever
it follows the words I am as a fact
that's becoming your reality your
perception you are placing yourself into
that state willingly so whatever you say
after the words I am the genie goes your
wish is my command this all leads me
back to the law of attraction whatever
goes through your head your thoughts
will eventually become things and this
can be a good or bad thing depending on
how you choose to conduct your thoughts
I'm shining light to all this power that
you're holding your hand right now and
it might overwhelm you and you're like
wait no this sounds too good to be real
and that's because it is good whatever
you say your thoughts will become
reality if you see it in your mind you
will hold it in your hand this can be
anything
this can be continuously picturing that
you have straight A's on a report card
visualizing visualizing is the most
important tool you have in the law of
attraction and if you really focus on
something hard enough and continuously
visualize something it will come true so
if there are certain things in your life
that continuously bring you misery and
upset you and give you stress you can
start off by just literally making a
list of the things that you don't like
in your life maybe it's a toxic friend
maybe it's bad grades and algebra
whatever it is make a list of it now in
your head if you picture like these
things that always make you like
miserable that's all that's gonna come
back to you so everything you put out
into the world find its way to come back
to you if you're constantly vibing off
positive thoughts positive energy and
positive mindset those things are
guaranteed to find their way back to you
but if you're always just inflicting
three on other people that's what you're
gonna get back and when you're like just
thing positively like have a positive
mindset people like yeah I eat like I
get grades um I do relationship with my
family and you want to have a positive
mindset how is that gonna happen like I
said in the first step you just have to
constantly visualize you having good
grades in your head print out pictures
of a plus signs and glue them over your
door physically seeing the opposite of
what you're struggling to go through in
your life right now is gonna help you
flip the situation and how is it going
to happen you may ask so we have this
like motivational speaker give a speech
at our school the other day and they're
just teenagers that are very miserable
and can't wait to get over with the
three months remaining in her high
school careers that's why our school
wanted to kind of bring this
motivational speaker in just to like you
know prevent maybe like 5 to 10 of us
that actually paid attention to what she
was saying and I did I took notes and
she said this particular thing about
goals that really caught my attention
cuz I had never heard it anywhere else
she said
flashlight goals versus laser goals
here's an example of what that means a
flashlight goal would be saying I'm
going to be really healthy this year and
she said flashlight goals don't really
work a laser goal would be I'm gonna go
to the gym on Mondays at 4 p.m. for one
hour
so flashlight goals are broad they light
up a big amount of area but they're not
very strong and they die off a laser
beam however points straight to a
particular goal and it's very strong so
it's not gonna die out so the more
specific your goal is the higher your
chance of achieving it is your ultimate
goal may be to be healthy but you're not
a superhero you're not gonna just know
how to achieve it like this magically if
the next day you wake up that's why it's
important to set many goals for yourself
they knock out that in the end lead you
to that big goal and also your goal
shouldn't be like a tab in your notes on
your phone that says 2018 goals number
one get into summer bod number two get
straight A's number three get a dog and
you need to give life to your goals then
you'd grow with you they need to be a
part of you you can't just create them
let them live for a good two days and
kill them off and as you knock off every
little goal and you continue to grow you
need to adjust your goals so that they
grow with you only 8% of people actually
keep their new year resolutions
willpower in other terms
short-term motivation only lasts 48
hours so it's not even sustainable so
that like bulging poof of like
motivation energy you feel on New Year's
Eve dies out like before even January
3rd and I feel like something that's
very important and the end of the day is
taking a step back and looking around
you and this might sound cheesy but at
the end of the day finding gratitude and
the things that you do have even if
you're struggling with it like maybe you
got a D in a class you should still be
thankful for that D because there's
Paulie a kid in India that really wants
to attend school but can't even though
I'm a firm believer that everyone's
perception is their own reality so just
because someone else has a worse than
you doesn't mean you don't get to be sad
about something even if you're more
privileged than them that would be the
same thing as saying hey why are you
happy
this person is happier than you you
can't be happy working on changing the
way you process things looking at things
with a more positive attitude might be
difficult it's gonna all come back to
you and you're gonna realize that whoa
like hold up how was office good stuff
happening to me this kind of happens
without your conscience even realizing
it and without you even putting a lot of
hard work into it but once you change
your mindset the way you take on
challenges the way you talk to people
connect to people it kind of becomes a
natural process you have the power to
create the life you deserve maybe you
want to be really wealthy if you're
looking at money as something that has
power over you that you need to get to
you're doing it wrong you're the master
of the money and the money is your
servant visualizing and changing your
mindset are the ultimate tools to
knocking off a goal and finally
eliminate all doubt questioning whether
or not you have the strength to go
through something is the only thing
that's really holding you back if you
wipe out can I actually do this or like
what if it doesn't work out from your
thought process you just replace every
droplet of doubt in your brain with
expectations and you start thinking oh
this is what's gonna happen in like
three months set one mini daily goal for
yourself that you need to achieve every
single day maybe that's the first step
you need to take
you even like start any other things I
just said to you and maybe today's goal
is I am going to have a healthy
breakfast tomorrow's might be I'm going
to have a healthy breakfast and a
healthy lunch the next day might be I'm
going on a run for 45 minutes before you
know it it's going to be I am becoming
fit I am fit and I am happy I am
sweating for those of you that did find
the sense in what I said and can relate
and are looking forward to tomorrow
tonight thoughts become things and
you're the one doing the thinking you
have the power to think whatever you
want to become reality your imagination
is endless you can start thinking of
what you want to be reality right now
and I promise you as long as you hold on
to that thought that's gonna be your
real life I hope you guys enjoy this
video let's start a conversation in the
comments and I'll see you guys next
Saturday and my next video I love you
guys so much all the way to Kyoto I'm
back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
