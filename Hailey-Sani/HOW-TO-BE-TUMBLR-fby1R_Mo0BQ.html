on makeup so I could look like a beauty
guru so today I'm gonna be filming a
video to know how you can be tumblr and
I've never seen anybody else do this
video because I'm pretty much the only
person that gets stupid ideas like this
but it was much needed because today in
our society tumblr takes a whole lot of
space and some of us are like really
coolest on what's going on so being the
very helpful person I am I decided I
would guide you through the journey if
you have no idea what tumblr is at all
then keep doing what you're doing you're
better off without it
and please eggs out of this video this
is a command not a request
because tumblr is basically a black hole
that will suck you in and there's no way
out
and it's basically the end of your
social life so do yourself a favor do me
a favor however if you are familiar with
tumblr then hi I'm one of you we're all
doomed
since there are so many of us it's a
really big community and there are so
many types of people on tumblr so it's
kind of like the Mean Girls lunchroom
and today I'm going to be guiding you
through each tumblr personality and you
can just pick out whichever suits you
the best and join into that groove and
even though tumblr is divided into
groups these aren't like really strict
boundaries they're really flexible so
I'm not saying that I feel a part of one
group you can't be anything like the
other group because it's kind of like
really jumbled up and mixed and it blows
your mind that's how it is around here
you know it's really disciplinary but no
I'm just doing this video for fun guys
so that further ado I'm going to be
taking you through the stereotypical
characteristics of the tumblr person
so the first tumblr personality I'm
going to be talking about is the grunge
and grunge is separating to a lot of
like different types of grunge like soft
grunge grunge yeah I think that's all I
got a lot of you are gonna be saying
like go into the type of music it's not
type of personality well actually it is
a type of personality because the type
of personality you have actually
reflects on your other choices in your
life style like the music you listen to
the way you dress and your attitude
towards life in general usually the
grunge personality leans on like apathy
and uncaring attitude they pretty much
have a lack of interest in anything they
usually have cynical and negative looks
upon life so it's basically your dark
soul depressed girl you know and some of
these people are actually like that they
pretty much hate life but some of these
people just act that way so they can be
cool which in my opinion is very stupid
like why would you act like you don't
care about life when you do because life
is such an amazing thing and there's so
much to like love and like realize about
it because I like to believe that being
alive is like winning a ticket from the
lottery not everybody gets that ticket
and not everybody is able to experience
all the beauty around you anyways back
on the point the Grunch person tends to
listen to again like dark depressed
music the lyrics of the music that they
listen to it like angst-filled and like
fear son like a little depressed and
maybe sometimes sad some examples of
these types of music is Nirvana nirvana
is like the god of grunge music they
pretty much like invented the whole
concept and then there's like Pearl Jam
like Alice in Chains and if they're like
a wannabe grunge person then they listen
to Arctic Monkeys because they actually
don't really like that
music but arctic monkeys kind of
resembles it a little bit and they're ok
with it so they're like oh my god I love
Arctic Monkeys I'm so grunge oh my god
you don't have to be grunge to be able
to listen to Nirvana I have a few
Nirvana songs in my phone and I don't
hate life and like I said the type
person that you are in the inside
reflects on the outside so that brings
me to like grunge fashion and I'm a big
fan of soft grunge fashion the word
style means the defining characteristics
of a person and people tend to mix that
up with like sense of style like the way
you dress but like even the way you
laugh even the way you talk like be your
style grunge people wear like black
lipstick or like dark lipstick they have
like chokers flannels are a big part of
grunge enos they like to wear like
distressed denim beanies dr. Martin
moving on to another tumblr personality
its hipster v the pods daddy
and you probably heard this so much like
oh my god girl those shoes are so histor
she dresses so hipster basically hipster
ism was created I think in the 80s or
like 70s like the flower child the baby
boomer is obviously I'm not a baby
boomer I mean yeah I'm 14 back in the
day hipster ISM resembled like loving
and wanting peace on earth hipsters were
totally against mainstream things I used
to shop at thrift stores and they just
like dress vintage hipsters want to look
effortlessly cool for now in the modern
days people want to dress hipster so
they actually put a lot of effort into
looking effortlessly cool does that even
make any sense most hipsters were
interested in the art and I think a lot
of them like used to live in Brooklyn
that's why there are so many like cool
museums there but obviously it didn't
last forever it was basically gone after
like the 80s and it was bought back
again in like 2000 like 10 or something
but it was mixed with a modern touch so
basically anything at Urban Outfitters
is supposed to be hipster like flower
crowns and like flappy hats and like
stickers on their faces like if you go
to Coachella you're considered hipster
and then there's like different like
types of people there like indie and
they're like bohemian people like mix
those things together and then they
create like different cool styles so if
you think hipsters in is like right for
you then like your style icon is
magically Vanessa Hudgens and then
there's the ever so white girl
I remember when we broke up first time
oh and you probably know these even if
you didn't know the previous two
personalities I talked about you
probably know these because they're not
only on tumblr they're everywhere
but the white girl on tumblr is usually
the girl that posts like quality
pictures by quality I don't mean like
brilliant and like classy photos quality
is something totally different it's
basically when girls like curl their
hair don't show their face or they like
close their face with their hands and
they take pictures of anything that says
Victoria Secret pink on it
I feel like hey I think they're going
extinct on tumblr but that's how like
Acacia it's how she got famous by like
taking pictures of her hair and other
things the white girl is the girl you
would find sitting in Starbucks with
hugs with an iPhone in her hand I asked
for extra whip and extra caramel sauce
on my back Chino because if I don't do
that the picture does not turn out
amazing and instead you gave me double
shots of espresso so is there like any
chance that you could switch this out
for another drink
preferably a vanilla bean Frappuccino if
your Starbucks order isn't longer than
10 words is it even a Starbucks order
besides Victoria's Secret pain they tend
to shop at like brandy melville and they
love to eat Taco Bell and they're
obsessed with frozen and they know every
single song by heart by by heart and
finally I may be talking about the
typical Tomo personality the one that
doesn't fall into any of the categories
I talked about before
so the typical tumblr personality
listens to whatever they like they don't
like care about what other people listen
to in my case Lana Del Rey they drink
everything out of mason jars because I
mean it's a jar that you can drink out
of if you ask us what kind of car we
want it's always the same not black
Range Rover if you're extra cool then
you have a forward camera and you even
have a plural camera collage on your
wall speaking of wall you obviously have
to have very lights going all around the
room you know what else is on your
all at APUs tree where do you shop
preferably American Apparel and Urban
Outfitters but if your wallet only has
20 dollars in it and you just shop it
forever 21 like everybody else they also
like to wear Nikes with the heel and
like these like chunky boots or like
just chunky shoes in general and that's
all the categories I have and isn't it
so weird how tumblr has such a big
influence on society literally a website
with pictures can change your lifestyle
and define your character and this
website like changing the type of music
you like or the clothes you wear however
I don't support this at all I don't
think a website should have any control
over our character or the type of person
we are thanks for watching this video
guys and if you got to this point and
still haven't realized that I'm like
joking about the whole like fitting into
a category thing then maybe I should be
a little more sarcastic next time it was
me trying to say that dividing our
society into groups is dumb so yeah
thanks for watching this video guys
leave a comment down below on what you
thought about it and I love you all to
put out I'm back bye
