spring day it literally feels so warm
outside I'm taking my dog on a walk it's
so warm that I had to take my jacket off
babbu smash potatoes and eggs cucumbers
tomatoes parsley for lunch we're going
on apart we're gonna work out adds up
for me except for my sister who's a lazy
couch potato
so my workout today is going to be off
of an app called runtastic this app is
my new holy grail and I genuinely really
like this app and I want you guys to try
it out so when I first downloaded the
app it made me take this 15-minute
fitness test and it determined my level
so now that the app knows my level I
customized personal workouts for me
which is perfect
it's a 12-week bodyweight training
workout plan and I'm so excited for
these twelve weeks because I want to see
my progress and I also want to like
incorporate these get healthy with me
videos so I could share my progress with
you guys it's like a personal coach it
has easy to follow training exercises
yes workouts diet plans motivation
health and fitness tips and they also
have a youtube channel where you can get
your first workout for free so yeah
let's get our fitness on guys
oh those rolls though oh my god squirrel
squirrel
there will be a link to subscribe to
runtastic results in the downbar so make
sure you check that out I just finished
that workout and it was really
interesting because it was like never
like a workout that I did before I think
it was more of like a high-intensity
interval training type of workout so we
went back home from the park changed my
outfit and right now we're at Santa
Monica we're going to grab some lemonade
I feel like lemonade tastes really good
but it's also really healthy that's what
we're doing we out here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
