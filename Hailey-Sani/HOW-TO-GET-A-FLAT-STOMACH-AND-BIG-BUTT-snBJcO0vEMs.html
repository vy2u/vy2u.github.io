obviously I can't calories calories are
the most important things and being fit
and healthy hi guys is Haley here and
today I'm gonna be filming a fitness Q&amp;amp;A
it's been so long since I've just like
stood in from the camera and filmed a
video talking to you guys you asked me
questions on my Instagram which is at
Haley Sunday you should definitely
follow me on there not Thursday or
anything just saying like if you want to
be in these videos you should probably
follow me a lot of you ask the same kind
of questions so I just picked a few of
the most asked ones and I'm gonna be
answering those so the most asked
question was how often do you work out
I'm gonna be talking off of what I
usually do now it's summertime and I've
been traveling ever since summer started
so I only Sadie's for the past two
months but usually during the school
year I work out around three or four
times a week sometimes five time feeling
it sometimes two if I'm not feeling you
and around an hour and a half to two
hours the second question I got asked
was how do you stay motivated if you
workout then you probably know that
feeling after your workout where you
feel strong you feel fit and home somali
you feel happy because your body is
filled with endorphins which is
basically the hormone of happiness and
that hormone is so addictive once you
start feeling that you always want to
feel that way why would you not do
something that you know would make you
feel happy when I'm fit and healthy I
feel confident and I feel good in myself
and that's just a feeling I can't give
up you guys asked it around 250 of you
almost how you get a bigger booty I
wouldn't say I got the biggest one
however I remember how it used to be and
I'm glad it doesn't look like that
anymore my biggest tip is doing blue
workouts and glutes are the muscles on
your butt
these include squats leg raises like
every single
exercise you can do in that cat position
where you're like lifting yourself up
that's good for your butt keep doing
those do 50 of those 100 of those 150 of
those a lot of you ask me if I'm vegan
because in my videos I talked a lot
about plant-based diets in how they're
really good for you even though I'm not
vegan and I'm not vegan because I don't
want to be vegan it's because there's a
big barrier between me and my parents
and veganism and it's really hard to get
over that barrier definitely like to try
veganism when I'm independent which
leads me on to another question that you
all ask me a lot which is to talk a
little about my diet I was born and
raised around the Mediterranean and
there's a lot of fresh fruits and
vegetables which I'm grateful for
because growing up that's pretty much
all I ate like we'd never have grilled
cheese for lunch or quinoa butter and
jelly for breakfast or hamburgers for
dinner that never was her thing like
around a year ago I cut out all meats
and chicken and I feel so much better by
myself my body feels so much fresher and
lighter I definitely recommend that you
guys ask me if I have any cheat days and
what are my cheat meals cheap gold that
is crap what do you cheat on tests to
light says no one you can't compare your
healthy lifestyle your healthy diet to
like exams or like tests I'm not like a
health freak and I don't only eat celery
guys it's possible to be healthy and
normal what have you asked me do you
remember the last time you ate chocolate
yesterday today chocolate makes me so
happy like why would I give up chocolate
it's all about like this balance guys
you have to holmes the earth in your
body and you're going to live in your
body for the rest of your life and
you're stuck with it you might as well
take good care of it Cameron oh my god a
funny one I'm literally like the stuff
inspiration I'm like wow the most
popular question was how you get a flat
stomach and a lot of you think it's like
impossible a flat stomach is something
that comes with being healthy
being fit you can get a flat stomach
without doing all these things
there's not like cheat a board out there
is it a five-minute ab workout that will
get you a flat stomach on C I feel like
if there was a cheat to it it would be
to not eat after like 7:00 p.m. because
after 7:00 p.m. your digestion starts
going down because it's been like
digesting the whole day and also like
you start becoming less active because
you're like tired and if you eat like a
really big dinner it's really hard for
your stomach to digest that and if your
diet is healthy anyways you'll like 100%
wake up with a flat stomach you guys ask
me if I count calories and obviously I
can't calories calories are the most
important things than being fit and
healthy of the average woman has to
consume around 2,000 calories and I like
to go a lot under that because obviously
I'm gonna be really skinny I'll consume
around 800 calories everyday I will not
go over that even if I'm hungry and I
know I had 800 calories I will not go
over that so yeah just like eat 800
calories every day and you'll be like
really skinny and really fake and really
strong do you think it'd end up being
fit and healthy even though you never
went over 800 calories and well the only
thing you consume those chips and cook
what's the point of counting calories of
what you're eating is whole foods that
are nutritious and good for you to those
of you that still believe that caliing
restrict thing is a thing in 2016 Tahlia
restricting was like back in 2010 when
like women's health was telling you to
do it you know so that was it for my
fitness to day I hope you guys enjoyed
it I will might answer some of your
questions leave a comment down below
with your question and if I haven't
answered already I will answer it I
promise you think I so much for watching
this view and I love you guys all the
way some to know and back nice
