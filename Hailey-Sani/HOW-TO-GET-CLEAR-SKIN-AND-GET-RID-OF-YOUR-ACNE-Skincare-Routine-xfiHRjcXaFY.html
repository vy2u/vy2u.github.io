gonna be filming my very highly
requested skincare routine and this
video is targeted towards those of you
that are struggling with acne and you've
tried every homemade remedy on Google
and every product out there and every
face mask in the market and you've given
up you've lost all your hope and you're
just sit there with your pimples I'm
here to tell you that there's always a
cure and you never give up because in
this video we're going to be testing out
a new face mask that you've probably
never heard or seen before and it gets
better I'm actually gonna be giving away
3 Target gift cards worth $40 which you
can use to go to Target and purchase
this mask for yourself I'm going to be
starting this video off my everyday
skincare routine and then the end we're
going to be trying the new Neutrogena
light therapy acne mask it's kind of
funny kind of quirky so you should
definitely stick around till the end so
if you want glowy clear acne free skin
keep watching so I'm going to be
starting off with my Bioderma makeup
removing h2o water this is my favorite
makeup remover it takes off all my
makeup and all the dirt on my face
without making me feel like I'm putting
a bunch of chemicals to do so next I'm
going to be getting my lush ocean salt
face exfoliator and I love exfoliating
my face because it gets rid of all the
dead skin cells and all the excess oil
and dirt that buildup on your face
throughout the day and it leaves your
face feeling fresh and clean so I
massage the salts into my skin for a
couple minutes especially around my
t-zone and my nose area which is where
oil tends to build up the most and then
rinse it off with some warm water moving
on I like to use a cleansing mask either
my glam glow or my mask of Magnum inti
by lush and this is one of my favorite
masks because it's so minty and it feels
so good on your skin and it leaves it
feeling very soft so I like to keep this
on for around 5 to 10 minutes
I love the mint juleps lip scrub from
lush and makes your lips so soft gets
rid of all your chapped lips all the
dead skin cells on your lips and it
makes your lips feel so plumpie it's my
favorite thing in the whole entire world
and it's all natural so you can
literally eat it it tastes really good
once my mask has been on my face for 5
to 10 minutes I like to rub it off while
massaging
into my skin with some warm water and
sometimes masks can get really annoying
trying to remove just with water so you
can definitely use a wet towel so now
that I've removed my makeup exfoliated
my face exploring my lips put on a nice
cleansing mask I'm going to be moving on
to Neutrogena light therapy acne mask so
when we open this up and it comes with a
mess when I said a mask if you thought
of some kind of mud mask or peeling mask
no this is an actual mask like Halloween
mask Daft Punk mess like Star Wars mask
it's an actual mask if things are about
to get groovy in here
groovy do people still use that word so
this activator is connected to your mask
shoots out red and blue lights and the
red and blue lights go into your skin
and reduce the bacteria which causes a
cuneiform and just because you don't
have pimples on the surface of your face
doesn't mean you'll have bacteria
sitting under your skin which can cause
acne in the future every mask comes with
one activator and each activator you can
use up to 30 times and each treatment
only lasts about 10 minutes so it's a
really quick and easy process and it's a
lot of fun like I'm not even gonna lie
it's super easy all you do is put on
your mask I actually feel like that bug
like I need a minute hold on the mask
comes with a bunch of little light bulbs
built-in inside and once you press this
button all I have to do is put on your
mask and sit down relax read a book
watch a couple YouTube videos for 10
minutes and then you're done with your
treatment once your treatment is done
the lights shut off on your tongue oh my
god this is crazy
wait why I will have to talk when we
have this on this is so cool I wish you
guys were here there's literally there's
a disco party in my face right now
no like you guys don't understand like
there's a party in my face right now if
there's a party and I'm gonna have clear
skin
okay oh my god I need to snapchat this I
need to not trap my friends my face
right now oh my god this is so you guys
need to try this you guys need to go to
Target right now buy smash try it on I'm
giving away three Target gift cards that

social media so make sure you got me all
added up on there so after I'm done with
my acne mask I like to moisturize my
face with the glam glow duo overnight
moisturizer and the smells really good
and it's very smooth on your skin and my
last step is chapstick so that is my
full skin care routine keep in mind I
only use my exfoliator zhan my cleansing
mask only like three times a week so
it's not every single day and obviously
eat clean and drink a lot of water I'm
sorry but if your eating habits are
really bad no matter what products you
use you're not going to be getting the
results that you want to get so that's
it for this video I definitely recommend

Neutrogena light therapy acne mask and
