going to be filming a video on tips to
get clear skin
unfortunately this video wasn't targeted
towards people with intense acne because
I've never dealt with acne so I don't
know how to really treat it however it
is for people I like breakouts every
once in a while because I'm gonna be
sharing my tips on how I prevent myself
from breaking out every now and then
just because I follow these tips does
not mean I have clear skin 24/7 I get a
pimple every now and then but I have
reduce it to the lowest amount possible
so without further ado I'm going to go
ahead and start with tip number 1 so
what I like to do is wash my face before
bed because throughout the day dirt and
bacteria will get stuck on your face and
go in your pores and if you don't clean
them out then they'll like want pimples
and they'll make your breakout basically
so I definitely recommend getting like a
natural or organic cleanser and using
that on your face before you go to bed
even though I recommend using like a
daily cleanser and a moisturizer and
maybe some tonic I don't think they
should be using 600 products on your
face because there are so many chemicals
and like face product too many chemicals
will dry our skin cost pimples etc you
don't want that so I think two or three
products will do unless you have a
dermatologist that tells you to use
specific products on your face every day
then there's nothing I can say about
that because you went to college and
learned all about that stuff and I'm
just a 14 year old in my bedroom
so sometimes even after you wash your
skin that are leftover makeup the
buildup on your pores that cause
breakouts so if you want to like get
deeper into your skin and really clean
it and also like clean all the dead skin
cells stimulate your blood sir from your
face for like extra radiant glow you can
use a cleansing brush I like to
exfoliate my face with my life my shop
cleansing brush so I got this online and
it has like three calm face brushes the
brush will definitely get deeper inside
your skin then you're like soaked up
fingers will so I down the recommend
using an exfoliating brush and you guys
are looking into buying one I have a
discount code down below just for you
guys it's so cute it has like this oh my
god I think you can like literally put
your brush in here
it's me convenient Oh everyone like very
cleanly store them I'm all about the
Hadji and I definitely recommend
exfoliating while you're in the shower
because the steam helps open up your
pores so you can really dig out all the
grime
let's left behind if you want to get a
step closer to having a flawless canvas
then you can definitely check out a
cleansing brush so after putting my hair
up I get my face wet so I can start my
exfoliating routine and I got my natural
exfoliator that I made myself and I will
show you how I did it
later on in the video and I put it all
over my face then I start using my brush
and the brush is actually really cool
because it goes both ways it goes
clockwise and counterclockwise therefore
you can really get all the dead skin
cells off and then I turn it off and put
it on it smell a cute stand
I'll link my like my shop down below you
can buy exfoliators online or you just
make them yourself and I'm gonna be
showing you how to make your own DIY
delicious might I add organic
exfoliating the first thing I did was
got two tablespoons of sugar and the
sugar will help remove the dead skin
cell therefore leaving your skin smooth
and I use half a tablespoon of olive oil
which will also help keep your skin very
soft and then I use honey which has
antibacterial properties killing
bacteria and I used a squeeze of lemon
which helps brighten your skin and just
a drop of food coloring and I definitely
recommend you use this if you want it to
be like super natural but I just thought
it'd look really pretty for this video
and you just gotta mix it all together
and you know you've got that okay yeah
I'm going and then I got this little
cute jar and fill it to the very brim
with my colorful DIY delicious
exfoliator finally you can press down
the mixture with your finger and you're
finished
the most obvious tip to drink lots of
water I drink so much water a day people
literally think my water bottle is my
best friend say you should be drinking a
lot of h2o because water cleans out all
the toxins from your body therefore
there won't be any bacteria left on your
skin which causes break out here is a
skin hack that I didn't even know but I
googled it online and there is like
scientific proof as you guys know sea
salt is natural antiseptic so where do
you find sea salt sea
in the ocean so that means if you go to
the beach we're swimming a lot then I'll
most likely clear out your skin because
he saw will kill and fight all the
bacteria and therefore you will get less
breakouts oh my god I'm alright ladies
you can exfoliate with sea salt it'll
get rid of black hat black out all about
that electricity you can exfoliate with
sea salt it'll get rid of blackheads and
it will make your skin look more radiant
another natural antibiotic that I read
online but I've never tried for myself
so I can't like promise anything is
rubbing garlic over your pimples garlic
has disinfecting special cheese however
I don't know if it's gonna work on your
pimples at a1 you're like break out even
more but I have heard of it you can rub
a little bit of garlic over your pimples
hey maybe you tried everything and
nothing worth a B this well I don't know
give it a shot
and my last tip that I cannot stress
enough is do not pop your pimples okay
so when you have a pimple think of it
like a little bag that holds acne
bacteria oil and debris is a pustule
that basically keeps the bacteria
contained when you pop that so-called
bag the disgusting gunk loses out
therefore but either seeps into other
pores around your pimple area or it goes
down also there's bacteria on your
fingers so when you pop a pimple it can
like mix with that bacteria therefore
causing even more pimples and when the
gun goes in your other pores or it seeps
into your skin spreads around in your
skin you will get more pimples and you
don't want that so just let your pimple
live its life do not do anything to it
unless you use something that dries it
out or like kills the bacteria do not
keep on touching it your hands are nasty
oh they'll grow all my tips for clear
skin
I could help you guys if you try these
out and they help you I'm so happy I
could help and I love you all so much
all the way to Prudhoe and bye guys

salt I'll get a Papa you can get you can
