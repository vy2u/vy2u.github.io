subscribed what are you doing it's a
subscribe button right there and make
sure you click the bell right next to it
to get notifications every time I upload
which is every Saturday so every time I
have a Q&amp;amp;A or I'm on Instagram live or
something the top question I get is how
do you stay motivated to be healthy and
fit when I think about that I realize
how hard it is so I understand why
people would have so many questions
about that because I for the most part
like to live a healthy lifestyle that's
been my journey for the past like couple
years now I always get questions from
people that want to hop into the
bandwagon not in a bad way or at all and
it's quite difficult stay healthy for a
couple weeks it's fine but people kind
of tend to fall off so I came up with
some tips that are really efficient and
easy to use and they literally help you
hack into the whole like healthy
lifestyle system and I think you're
really gonna enjoy it especially for the
new year it's a new beginning a new
start this could really be their year
for you where you change both physically
and mentally and become a better you and
I just want to help you guys achieve
that in 2018
so with that further ado let's hop into
the video a big part of staying healthy
is diet exercise and working out how you
take care of yourself mentally are all
really important factors but when it
comes down to how you actually look the
things you we actually have a bigger
effect than the work crafts you do and
personally I struggle a lot more with
diet than I do with actually getting
myself up to go and work out I'll see
you slice a cake and like everyone I
also will be eating a slice of cake and
I'll be like you only live once
let me also beat this slice of cake
which that's there's nothing wrong with
that but in order to like kind of
prevent that and constantly fall into
this black hole of just like unhealthy
meals and you're like I'll stir Monday
ah start Monday like to cut that cycle
kinda something that you should start
doing is prepping your meals every time
I think of the phrase meal prepping what
pops into my mind is like those like
Instagram Fitness people that like make
the same thing for the whole week for me
that's very boring I don't think you
should live your life like that so I
want to talk about this like food
subscription company and it is my
obsession for the new year and
I'm sure it will be yours too so it's
called hellofresh you might have heard
of it and they give you food I probably
caught your attention because that's how
they caught my attention so basically
they delivered me a box with three meals
and they each had ingredients in them to
prepare the meals I'm a bad cook
everyone kind of knows me as that but
the meals I made were delicious
because I didn't really have to like
follow a lot of steps they were all very
simple and I think the thing that made
the change for me is the ingredients
come already pre-prepared they have the
exact amounts of food in little cute
tiny packages and all you have to do is
mix them up and if I can do that then
anyone can do that for me I'm a
vegetarian so they have vegetarian
options so you can basically have
someone semi prepare your healthy meals
for you for me the pressure of going to
the supermarket and picking out like
healthy ingredients and then coming home
and like trying to think of like healthy
recipes to follow and then like
sometimes you make them and you're like
demotivated and you're like I don't even
want to do this again to literally save
you so much time so much effort so
simple you get a meal for less than 10
bucks and all you do is come home put
their ingredients together and you have
a delicious meal that takes less than 30
minutes to prepare and it also works if
you're a vegetarian like I get the
veggie clam I'll show you some clips of
me being a wife like do you see me
making that black bean burger like how
effing good does that look like it's the
holiday time I want to be a little nice
mrs. Santa here I have a promo code it's
Haley sunny 30 you get $30 off if you
subscribe I'm gonna be linking
hellofresh
in the downbar okay snacking is usually
something else that messes me up even if
you like eat and healthy meals if you
have unhealthy snacks throughout the day
it kind of messes up your whole like
plan so a tip is try not to have
unhealthy food in your house because if
you don't have anything unhealthy in
your pantry then obviously you're not
gonna have anything unhealthy to snack
on genius a genius concept you're not
gonna have like potato chips and you're
announced to binge on while you're
watching Netflix because you don't have
potato chips to binge on and you'll have
like sliced apples or something instead
so this is kind of similar to meal
prepping but it's for working out so
it's like
work out prepping a major tip for me is
don't really sign up for a gym I feel
like gyms don't work because you can get
a membership but there's no one
literally forcing you to go workout
unless you have like a trainer which is
also what falls into this category where
you have to literally prepay in order to
go take a class so if I buy ten soul
cycle classes like in the beginning of
the month that means I have to do soul
cycle ten times or else I'll be wasting
my money if you already paid for a class
it's much more likely that you're
actually gonna end up going because work
out classes are expensive I don't want
to waste
thirty dollars on a class so I'm gonna
end up going and doing soul cycles
whereas going to the gym you won't
prioritize as much because there isn't
like a physical force like pushing you
to go there or like a consequence behind
not going besides getting fat an app I
like is class pass I think you pay like
50 bucks or something per month and then
you can like pick what classes that
you're gonna go to and book them and you
have like up to five classes basically
paying the money you would be paying for
a gym except you get a variety of
classes bringing me to my next step
tri workouts that are different like I
don't like going to the gym because the
same thing like same machines usually
the same people
it just gets boring whereas like if
you're going to a different workout
class like Pilates yoga you're
constantly doing different things so
you're working out your whole entire
body you're doing a bunch of things
you're having fun at the same time and
you're preventing yourself from getting
used to and tired of a workout that's
going to keep you from demotivating
yourself like if I had an underwater
cycling class this Friday you know how
excited I would be to like go work out
where I was like if you're like oh let's
go to the gym go on stairs for thirty
minutes that's just boring that's why
you're gonna fall out of track because
you're not excited to go you're not
gonna like become the super healthy Nike
Pro Master victorious secret body
trainer gal overnight nothing happens
overnight I wish it did it's the worst
advice ever I hate that advice I hate it
when people tell me but I know it's
correct it's kind of important to have
that in your mindset that way you don't
look at the mirror every week and being
like why isn't anything changing you
should completely stop analyzing
yourself for a period of time because it
happens very slowly but once it happens
you won't even have to analyze yourself
to see change because it'll be so
dramatic you'll literally see
the minute you like look in the mirror
or like wake up in the morning and feel
that okay now I'm gonna be going to like
specific things you can either do like
everyday or like during a workout
personally when I'm working out
especially when I'm like you know the
treadmill or like on the Stairmaster
something that like I'm in the same
position doing the same thing for a long
period of time I'm bored printing up
pictures of like people that you look up
to you're strong girl strong confident
girls that you like you know like people
that inspire you like if you print up
their pictures and like stick them on
the treadmill constantly looking at that
while you're working out literally
motivating yourself at the spot I've
done that before
like my friend Tati she's like a model
she wants to do Victoria's Secret so she
said she literally pulls up the
Victoria's Secret Fashion Show puts it
on your treadmill and watches it watch
you working out and that's her number
one motivator which I thought was so
smart if you like come up with a reason
for why you want this healthy lifestyle
change in the beginning and visualize it
literally in front of you while you're
doing your workout it would be so much
easier to get through your workout my
friend Olivia said she comes up with one
thing that she wants to do for that day
it could be health fitness related
something like I'm gonna stay away from
chocolate today or something like today
I'm gonna go to the gym and do 45
minutes on the Stairmaster just a single
goal that you want to achieve like a
hack I like doing a workout is I like to
like trick my conscience you like an
invisible voice like I'll be like after
this workout your body's gonna magically
transform into what you've been wanting
it to look like and feel like since you
started for your fitness journey imagine
like after this workout I'm gonna have a
fattest ass I like literally trick my
mind into believing that it sounds
stupid I don't know once you're like
cycling and you're like okay all I have
to do is get through this like 30
minutes and after this everything I've
worked hard on will pay off because I'll
have my dream booney it's not actually
gonna happen after that one workout but
if you tell that to yourself every time
you do that technically that is what's
happening yeah so like literally put
yourself in a parallel universe you know
no biggie I think something that's very
important for me is my music playlist
while I'm working out I am on beast mode
I'm sweating literally
beast-like trenched and gross beautiful
sweat that I love and hate at the same
time and I have Eminem in this year
Drake in this ear like if your workout
playlist is not lit if you are not
looking forward to working out just
because you can literally listen to that
music
didn't your workout playlist sucks ass
and you should listen to mine I'm
actually filming a workout routine in my
like workout playlist is gonna be in
that video so I don't want to like spoil
out for you guys but just subscribe so
those were all my tips to stay motivated
to be healthy and fit in the new year
and not falling out a track again and
also health and fitness isn't all about
working out it's also a lot about
mentality the flow of your body and like
how you feel when you wake up and the
emotions you go through I love you guys
so much if you have any tips for me or
like for anyone watching this video
leaving them in the comments down below
and I'll see you guys in my next video I
love you guys so much all the way to
Pluto and back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
