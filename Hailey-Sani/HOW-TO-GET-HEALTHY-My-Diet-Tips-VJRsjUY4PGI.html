going to be filming a video about how to
get healthy and this is mainly going to
focus on my diet and just like food tips
I guess and eating and food which is
like all my favorite things in one
sentence have you ever been in the cycle
where you decide to be really healthy
and then you're really healthy for a
little while and then you're like ah
that's this and then you just eat
everything in your house indulgent
treats and sweets and then you feel
really guilty so you go back to the
beginning and you say you're gonna be
healthy again then you're like f this
and on and on and on and on and it's
like this ongoing cycle that never
really seems to stop because I've been
there and done that and it very sucks
but I found the perfect way to not fall
into that cycle and actually have this
healthy lifestyle thing going till the
day you die so without further ado let's
get started so the first thing I started
to do is go grocery shopping on my own
before I used to just eat whatever my
mom bought me and like eat whatever she
made me but then I decided to take what
went in my body under my own control so
I decided to tag along with her whenever
she went shopping and I also started
doing shopping lists so along the week
if there was something that was missing
her that I want to buy I'd put it down
on a list that time shopping was work I
don't need to be explaining this but
without a list you can just go into the
grocery store go crazy buy everything
and I actually started doing my
groceries on my phone and an app called
avodah when I made shopping lists on a
boda
I could see where there were good deals
for the things that I was going to buy
and then I went to that store to go
shopping and let's say you're going to
buy bananas and bananas have a rebate on
them so you click unlock rebate you like
answer one question literally one random
question and then you get cash back to
your PayPal you can get Amazon gift
cards Starbucks gift cards support gift
cards for shopping so you're buying good
food
and you're getting money back for it so
it's like the best of both worlds I feel
like life just doesn't get better than
that all you have to do is purchase the
item that has like a deal like a rebate
and then you take a picture of your
received and they give you money back I
feel like it's not even real but I've
tried it and it works at in Israel so go
check out Mota I'll link it down below
when it comes to like my diet I've
learned that the number one thing is to
not restrict yourself don't restrict
yourself calorie wise the food you eat
your portions like do not restrict
yourself just learn to listen to your
body because your body is a part of
nature and nature is like perfect
everything has this perfect cycle so
with that it means you eat products that
come from nature itself so those are
fresh veggies fruits beans oats I
literally don't restrict myself at all
because I learned that you shouldn't eat
less you should just eat better if you
want to eat 20 bananas eat 20 bananas
fruit sugar is not bad for you because
it's not processed the same way as food
that comes from the factory like the
artificial sugars and I know that we
were all taught that carbs are bad for
you and they'll make you fat and it's
the total opposite because our body is
made up of cells and the main energy
source of cells comes from carbs sugar
glucose your body craves that that's why
when you eat pasta or potatoes you feel
good because you're so they're really
happy when it gets that food that it
to survive so do not be afraid to carve
the F up especially when it comes to
calories do not count your calories
because okay if you compare 500 calories
of veggies and potatoes to a hundred
calorie health bar it's not gonna be the
same thing I try to stay away from foods
that come from a factory as much as I
can because those have nasty chemicals
literally fake we don't like fake people
why would we like fake food ingredients
that have like 26 letters and then that
you can't even pronounce that you've
never even heard of like how can that
possibly be good for you keep your
ingredients list on your foods short so
that means if you're eating banana the
only ingredient in the banana is the
banana itself so like the last better
and another very important part of my
diet is I eat as plant-based as I can
especially me I have not had meat or
chicken and so long like pollo like two
months because I felt like if I didn't
eat a dead animal I didn't feel bad I
mean when there's a dead animal in your
body that your body has to digest
happily whoever thought that was okay
whoever thought fine helicopters while I
was filming a video was okay it really
slows down your metabolism so when your
meat free it's like amazing like I feel
lighter I feel more fresh I feel happier
like it's not weird like the food that
goes into your body affects your food
and people are like so if you don't eat
like beef or chicken like where do you
get your protein like honey did you know
that 100 grams of broccoli has like five
times more protein than 100 grams of
beef like educate yourself like No
another thing I did was like switch
unhealthy things but I didn't want to
like completely get rid of in my diet
because I really like them with
healthier options I used to drink like
normal milk now I drink like almond or
soy mode and it's like it tastes better
there's 50% more calcium in almond milk
than there is in normal milk so honey
like I got my vitamin D like don't worry
instead of like white bread I switch
like whole wheat bread so that's most of
my diet another super dooper ooper and
print thing that i feel like not a lot
of people take into consideration is
their water intake i drink around 3
liters of water every day and like if i
drink any less than that I automatically
can tell something is off like I'll
either have a headache or I'll feel bad
and then I'll drink water and then I'll
feel good again like nature's got this
honey just like leave it to Mother
Nature you've heard this like a million
times
add lemons add cucumbers add mint which
is actually like a bonus because it also
helped with your digestion who doesn't
like water though like I feel like
everyone should and you're probably
wondering like Hayley like everything
that you're saying sounds good but like
what about pizza
what about cake what about ice cream I
love pizza way too much to give it up so
I like to do it on whole-wheat dough
with no cheese and like no oil because
those are like nasty bad things and
sometimes you just go to the cafe with
your friends and there's a lava cake on
the menu and you want it so you order
the damn lava cake and don't start this
health journey because you hate your
body and you want it to look like Alexis
friend's body started because you love
your body and you want it to look like
the best that's ever looked and you want
to
you'll like the best you've ever felt
those little kids are playing Lord of
the Flies and I'm gonna like they're
gonna be painting their ends are gonna
be picking it they just let me puttin it
them again so thanks for watching this
video guys I hope I could help you I
hope I could help you I just realize
like next week I'm going to be doing a
video giving examples of the foods that
I eat make sure you watch that I love
you all so much so so much all the way
to Pluto and back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
