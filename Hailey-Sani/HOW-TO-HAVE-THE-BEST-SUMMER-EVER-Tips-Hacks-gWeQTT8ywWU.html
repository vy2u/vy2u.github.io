african doesn't restrict the narrative

dedicated political thing hey guys is
nearly sunny and today i'm gonna be
sharing with you guys some tips on how
you can prepare for the summer and also
some activity ideas and things you can
do with your friends in order to like
make it a more fun time if you're not
already make sure you subscribe clicking
the subscribe button down below i hope
you guys enjoy this video and without
further ado let's hop right into it so i
collaborated with go 90 to give you guys
my first idea when you can do this
summer
since you have so much free time in the
summer a really fun thing to do is
finding new TV shows to binge on I
personally use go 90 calm they have a
ton of original stuff to choose from and
free for anybody in the US which makes
it ten times better the one I've been
binging on recently is called the
relationship status and actually went to
the premiere of this and got hooked onto
it oh damn it you know yeah
oh you think of the show as like Love
Actually
but in TV show form it's basically a
bunch of different love stories all put
together and sometimes are funny
sometimes they're sad but it's always
really fun washing them the episodes are
pretty short too so it's not going to
bore you if you know what I mean
so if you're looking for a new fun show
to watch I'm going to link this down
below where you can check it out for
free I will change aside
as per my comment on another really
important thing you can start doing
towards the summer is starting to eat
healthier and I promise you if you do
this you're going to thank yourself so
much because when you eat healthy you
feel better you look good and you have
so much energy which is all you pretty
much need during the summer if you got a
lot one thing that I think looks so
pretty in the summer is having a glow so
I love using highlighters to achieve
that look my favorite palette to use is
the Anasazi and Nicole Guerriero palette
and I apply this and it looks so
beautiful and I also have a slight
obsession with being pan and everybody
knows the Sun is really bad for you so
to achieve that look I the L'Oreal
sublime bronze self-tanner and this is
the best self tanner I've ever used
you get tanned so easily and so fast and
it also leaves no streaks behind so I
definitely recommend that instead of you
know tanning for hours which is really
bad for your skin
coconut oil term Trader Joe's however if
you do prefer getting bronze from the
actual Sun a really good natural tanning
oil is coconut oil but even if you do
use that make sure you still protect
your skin using a sunscreen another
tanning oil that I really like is called
Banana Boat and I pretty much use this
because it smells really good a lot of
people forget that the sun rays can also
be really harmful for your hair so here
I have some orchid oil which is really
good to protect your hair from UV rays
and you can also use leaving conditioner
for a protecting layer I know every
summer we tell ourselves that we're
going to start doing things but make
this summer the actual summer you
actually start doing things it's really
all about the good vibes so just go hang
out with your friends and make some
really fun memory
Thank You London sake Calvin cuckoos

the intestine and Tory interlocking and
diverging moments the finish time is
great to see a mr. Colvin nautical thing

anybody in the US and I'm going to make
sure to link it down below I hope I
