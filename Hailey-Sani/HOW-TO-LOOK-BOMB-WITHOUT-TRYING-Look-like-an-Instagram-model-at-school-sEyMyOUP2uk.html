shake me be sharing with you guys the
video on title of bom without even
trying i'm going to show you guys how to
juice them really don't look that
involve current trends but don't take up
a lot of time or effort we they're
perfect for back school when you don't
have a lot of time in the morning but
you still want to load some like cute
you know
I literally feel like I look like an
Instagram model and I can see this look
in less than 10 minutes so if you want
to know how to do that keep on watching
oh by the way if you're not subscribed
make sure you do by clicking subscribe
and develop I'm going to be cheating my
way to a flawless finish because I don't
want to spend so much time on my makeup
especially in the morning my secret to
that is making sure my skin's moisturize
because I don't want to have crusty
looking dry skin instead I want to have
a glow that lasts all throughout the
school day another lifesaver is this
Dermalogica eye lift and basically just
gets rid of those dark circles and puffs
you have when you wake up really early
because it has a smell tip along with
the gel that adds like a cooling effect
that helps get rid of those what saves
me a lot of time is skipping foundation
straight to concealers so I just like to
put that under my eyes to brighten them
and cover up my dark circles to achieve
like that flawless look I feel like
covering up any dark spots on your face
ultimately makes you look more youthful
and glowy because your face looks bright
overall another hat is using a
foundation powder instead of a regular
powder to set your makeup because this
way it's going to add a lot of coverage
the one I'm using is from bare minerals
and this has the same effect as like a
high coverage liquid foundation and it
covers up every little imperfection I
personally think eyebrows are like one
of the most important things because
they're what frame your face but a hack
is using an eyebrow pencil like a shade
or two lighter than your natural eyebrow
colors this way if you mess up you won't
have to spend so much time trying to fix
it and it gives your eyebrows an overall
more natural look and you can always
build up if you want a more bold brow
but to get that super instagrammy
feathery eyebrow look if you know what
I'm talking about
I use light and short strokes upwards
and spoolie brush has also come in very
handy it's literally my best friend when
it comes to blending in my eyebrows and
then I also like to set them with a
clear gel recently
I like to brush them upwards to get that
feathery look that stays put all day
long
so I'm skipping eyeshadow completely
because this is a no tryin video and I'm
100% sure that would actually require a
lot of trying I think it looks the best
when my eyelashes are super long and
separated from each other so instead of
layering and clumping my lashes I just
like to apply a thin coat so it looks
like you didn't even do anything
moving on to contour I think contour
makes every face of balm so I like to
contour my cheekbones my jaw line my
forehead area and this also makes yield
cam so it looks like you did something
with your summer so this is the best
part of every makeup routine and this is
a highlighting part because I love this
 so much I put it everywhere I put
it on my cheekbones on my nose on my
brow bone on my Cupid's bow I mean the
more you glow the more you look like a
star so just tack it on your face my
favorite part is putting it in my inner
corners because this makes my eyes look
so bright I feel like applying a lip
balm under a lip gloss or lipstick makes
the application process a lot more
easier so that's what I like to do I
like to go with natural tones because I
feel like bright lips can kind of look
tacky sometimes especially when you're
trying to go for like a glowy natural
look and I finished off the look with
some Mario Badescu rose water spray so
it lasts all throughout the school day I
think this looks so natural and like you
literally woke up like this even though
you have a lot of products going on
there but it doesn't take more than like
10 minutes of your day
moving on to outfits the only thing that
you're going to need as a base for all
these looks is a plain big white t-shirt
so I'm here wearing it with jeans so I
decide to tuck it in and then what's
super cute is denim on denim it always
looks super Instagram like super trendy
but you're literally only putting on a
jacket and chains which you're probably
doing anyway but the look of denim on
top of denim just adds a different vibe
and especially if you pair it with cute
dandy jewelry it looks like you you know
put an effort into your outfit but it
literally takes less than three seconds
to put on a necklace I think adding
meals to an apple like this is just like
a cherry on top because you can't go
wrong with a pair of good meals I'm not
even kidding you these are like Gucci
look-alike ones and how cute is this fit
I'm somebody has to take an OOTD of me
so I can Instagram alike
right now back to the basics my shirts
now a dress and I'm pairing it with this
black leather jacket and these hats have
been everywhere recently and I think
they're the perfect accessory to make
any outfit a little bit cuter and I'm
pairing it with these black leather
booties these are from Topshop I believe
and they pull every outfit together and
make it look super designer and cheap I
think they're like shibashi look-alikes
but how cute is this outfit if the
leather jackets a little bit too edgy
for you you can switch it out for a
denim one so it's a more you know softer
playful 45 and if the Hat starts to
think for you just lose it and it's
still a cute fit these are all super
simple pieces that you can mix and match
effortlessly in a million different ways
to make some really cute Instagram like
outfits I hope you guys enjoyed this
video and I hope to see you guys in my
next one I love you guys so much all the
way to Pluto and</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
