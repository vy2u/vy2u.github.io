the Riesling in Q&amp;amp;A video if you're an
already make sure you subscribe clicking
the bun over here to become a part of
our sunny squad I asked you guys to ask
me questions like a week ago on my
Instagram and my Instagram it's actually
sunny if you don't follow me already you
definitely should it's my platform to
express my art aka my food and outfit so
basically by art I'm going to stop
rambling so let's get started venya zero
zero zero zero no one asked how was
Coachella and I've been dying to share
my experience with you guys because it
was absolutely amazing this year was so
much better than last year because we
actually knew what we were going into
and you know how to handle a little
festival it can get a little crazy at
times you guys remembered garage
clothing sent me last year but they also
sent me this year but sister becomes
different because they also want to put
up content on their own platforms we
were five girls in total that was me is
the Olivia Roy or Griffin armlet and
Izzie Parker's our adventure started
before we even got there we had like a
really fun day of shooting at Venice and
then we got there you would shoot every
morning before the festival and then we
would also shoot in the morning at the
festival and then the rest of the time
we work for you to do whatever we wanted
and with all the content a shot Astrix
together a really cute video like things
to do the summer slash how to make your
summer cow it turned out really cute
I'll link it down below so you can watch
it but overall you'll be able to tell my
experience there just by watching that
we had so much fun we saw all our
favorite artist Drake end up showing out
it was a really fun time if you could
get a tattoo what would it be
I've been obsessed with tattoos recently
not that I'm like obsessively getting on
myself such as like tattoos on like
other people were protective in general
I even like thought about like what
would I get if I were to get one I would
want like a list one like in since I
remember no one can see it and something
that kind of like kind of cool what kind
of stupid same time because if you're
getting two lip tattoo like you're
already doing some dumb so you might as
well just like take a dump
tattoo to go with it you know and the
reason I say Saddam is because like it's
so easy to get infected and like it
wears off in a couple years so something
like worth the pain I guess and I'm also
obsessed with red tattoos like I think
they were two cutest thing like a little
red tattoo where no one can
see it oh my god that's like my dream
and should I make it happen
don't tell anybody pushing on my parents
because they would like cut my head off
this question really caught my attention
but sadly libo asked what are your vibes
about life and I was like whoa there
that's me based off of the life I'm
living right now it's very in the moment
so I don't really plan that far ahead
I'm kind of just like getting through
the week I'm hustling hard always
keeping myself busy but also always
making time for the people I love with
friends and family work and school
things that don't fall to one of those
three categories you should be like look
out in my mind
and those things just like pile up and
kind of stress me out where does the
only thing I have to complain about I
wish there was like 36 hours in the day
that I would have time to like live life
to the fullest I do but I just wish I
had more time to experience it on a
deeper level kendricks along with so
many other people asked are you still
vegan and I kind of wanted to make this
clear
I never was vegan I was vegetarian at
some point event I became pescetarian
and I've been pasta Karen for the past
like two years I think veganism I did
like try for a week it was like a trial
on like a test run I never really fully
switched to a vegan diet diet want to
make that clear I never was vegan I just
did it for a week just to see how it
would go this question I could relate to
so much especially right now and I can't
pronounce your user name but she asked
what happens if you had something like
an unhealthy week and you want to get
back to track like being healthy but you
aren't as motivated as you used to be
this happens to me so many times where
I'll be healthy for a long time and then
I'll like fall out of track and kind of
like slip out of my routine and be
really unhealthy for a week or two weeks
and then I'll get back into my senses
and then continue along we're just
totally normal because we're all human
you really want unlike that the first
thing that I do is get my ass back in
the gym going to the gym for the first
time after really unhealthy week is like
the hardest part try and force your
friends to force you that's usually what
I do once you're done with your first
workout and your body releases like so
many endorphins it travels a drug so you
want to keep going back sinan Rachael
asked if there was something you want to
tell your younger
what would it be even if it's like a
year later I always look back and I'm
like girls like what were you doing
first of all all that hair I would just
tell my hat selves to chillax chill your
pants nothing you're worrying about
right now is gonna even matter in like
two months you're making yourself feel
bad for no reason especially like what
other people think just like don't even
care don't care at all cuz in a year
their opinions won't even matter to you
and you won't probably matter to that so
it's not worth getting you're getting
your hair in a net not pants in a twist
so it's not worth getting your pants in
a twist how do you describe your style
every to a I add this question because
every Q&amp;amp;A in my style changes lately
I've been really into like casual sheep
model off-duty I haven't worn jeans and
I don't remember the last time or jeans
so I'm usually either wearing sweat
pants but like not like bottom
sweatpants I try to find like cute swept
hands are like cool sweatpants or like
leggings and shorts or skirts or
something like that the jeans I just
can't like they're so like tight and
like uncomfortable and King likey and
Allah I've been really liking statements
sunglasses because I think like a cool
pair of sunglasses can pull it out fit
together and I've been wearing a lot of
cute basic tops like this that are basic
but they don't look chic every Q&amp;amp;A I get
questions about my religion which is
kind of like a taboo topic especially
for people on YouTube because there's so
many people with different religions and
I wouldn't want to ever say something
that would like offend anybody because
it's a very sensitive topic you know
it's important to be careful about what
you say I was born in Turkey and
Turkey's a Muslim country so jority of
people that live and are born there are
Muslim literally when you're born before
they even ask you they put like Muslim
on your birth certificate in my face it
was different because my parents didn't
let them do that so even to this day on
my birth certificate is like empty
because they're just like you can
pre-order you want to believe I don't
really follow any religions
I'm a deist a lot of people don't know
what that means it was kind of like a
heavy topic but we're all adults here
right and you're basically in the middle
of where you don't believe in a God but
you're not denying the fact that there
is a gulf either so you're not an
atheist but you don't follow with
specific religion either I feel like you
guys have been asking me this question
for years and I just always avoided it
because I didn't really know like if
it's weird to share that on YouTube but
I guess it's not nothing feels weird
right now that I just did it this was it
was really my favorite one jazz and
water apps how do you glow up like
emotionally physically mentally etc be
the best version of yourself and I am
the best example of that not that I'm
saying I woke up and I'm like super on
Dallas really not what I'm saying I'm
saying like emotionally the way I think
wise I learned to not give a about
what anybody thinks of me which I'm
really proud of because I used to be
really insecure at times I still do get
insecure because I'm like a human girl
and well girls are usually humans but
thanks for clearing that up Haley I was
always doubt myself and be like I'm
probably going to do this wrong or I'm
probably gonna mess up and I taught
myself to think that why would I be
doing it wrong like I'm probably doing
the right I'm not less than anybody else
however as yours do go by you are gonna
glow up emotionally mentally physically
just could one time happen through the
experiences you face through the people
you meet through the things you go
through kind of have to develop and you
aren't really given a choice if you're
struggling just know it's happening
you're just probably not aware of it
anyways that is the end of this video I
really like filming Q&amp;amp;A because I
literally I feel like I'm talking to a
friend right now or I'm on like a coffee
date with somebody I wish you guys were
all real and I would have like all like
almost fun with the Outland of a
president thousand bro boy I think mm I
can't believe that like if you told that
to leads two years ago strongly like
 her pants in some corner but
this Haley is like
calling children that to be honest if
you watch it to this point comment down
below because you're a true home anyways
I got so much all the way to Pluto a
Cairo one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
