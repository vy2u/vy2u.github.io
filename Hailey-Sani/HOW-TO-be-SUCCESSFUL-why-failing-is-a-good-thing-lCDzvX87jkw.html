going to be sharing with you guys a very
important video that I believe everyone
who's dealt with failure at any point in
their lives should watch the way failing
is viewed in our society right now is
very different than the way it should be
viewed so always the feminine hygiene
brand that I've worked with in the past
and that I've teamed up with to share
such powerful messages before they
reached out to me with another really
powerful message that I think would make
a very big difference in every young
girl's life and I'm always down to help
people as best as I can and spreading
positivity because I definitely believe
it's something our world needs a little
bit more of so they sent me a link to
their always hash tag like a girl keep
going video which I will be linking down
below and you should probably watch that
before continuing with this for this
video to make a little bit more sense
it's something everyone should watch
because it's addressing a problem that
we've all been through it talks about a
common misconception in our community
right now that failing is a bad thing
the word fail has always looked at as a
bad thing it's a negative thing it's
never looked at as something positive or
something people aim to do you know it's
everyone's biggest fear because when
you're going to something new or trying
something new for the first time or even
if it's something that you've been doing
failing is always the thing people try
to avoid and try to run away from a
feeling doesn't mean it's the end of the
world it's a learning experience it's a
way to improve yourself to progress and
to get closer to what you want to do
because next time you try to do that you
know what you did wrong so you're not
gonna do those things again so it's
gonna be easier and faster for you to
get what you want to do and when always
hit me with statistics on how the fear
failing actually affects girls I was
shook absolutely the only word that I
can think of to express how I felt at
that moment when people actually show
you like research is done by people and
when they lay everything in front of you
with numbers and evidence to support the
truth or what's actually happening it
kind of hits you at first and you're
like whoa I need a little time to
process this because this is happening
50% of girls feel paralyzed by the fear
of failing paralyzed as an immobilized
where they're so afraid of their next
move and how it's going to affect them
now they choose to stay where they are
and
keep themselves as far away as they can
to taking that risk and when they told
me that 75% of these girls think that
social media is what's feeling this fear
or making their fear of failure even
worse I just felt all this weight up on
my shoulders as if like being a part of
this community I'm somewhat responsible
for them to feel that way which is the
last thing I would want because my
personal experience with failure is so
much more different than that and I want
to share that with you guys because I
think would really help you guys see my
perspective on this when I first started
YouTube which was like a couple years
ago yuuji was just gaining a lot of
attention and video makers like myself
and beauty gears they were all merging
and it was just becoming really popular
and because of that channels around me
were growing so fast they would have
thousands and thousands of new people
watching them every day and when I
created my channel my experience was a
lot more different because I was not and
no means as popular or getting as many
views or as well-known as anyone around
me and I just wouldn't grow and it was
making me feel like I was failing on top
of all of that everyone at school was
making fun of me because they were like
just stop trying like can't you see you
failed and that could have been the
perfect timing for me to put away my
camera they're all my try bought out and
be like I failed I have to accept this
it's embarrassing and I'm just gonna
stop trying but instead I decide to use
that point of my life as a turning point
I was failing but that was caused by my
fear of failing because I was so scared
of doing something different sharing
what I truly wanted to share with my
viewers and I was so focused on just
like copying what other people around me
were doing that I wasn't taking risks I
wasn't doing anything out of my comfort
zone because I just had this feeling
inside me that what if I do do that and
I just fail so little Hayley like 13
years old or something realized that we
only fail when we don't try if I had
given up my channel right then and there
I would have never gotten to where I am
right now where I'm sharing my voice my
message with thousands of you all across
the world with just just crazy
in the first place I'm working with such
amazing brands to share even more
positive messages that was my goal in
the first place but I was just too blind
to see that because I was just so afraid
of going out of my comfort zone I've
been in your place I know that taking
risks is so scary because there's the
potential of failing behind it and
there's the potential of disappointing
people around you and disappointing
yourself but if we don't fail how are we
ever gonna be able to ask ourselves what
did I do wrong what was my mistake that
I can avoid in the future that could
help me get to success or get where I
want to be and when you get to success
you're unstoppable because your
confidence Peaks you know you did this
with your hard work and you're proud of
yourself that you didn't give up halfway
through I'm just trying to tell you that
failing is totally fine eight out of ten
girls said that they feel pressure to
please others and be perfect I think we
can all agree at this point from maybe
my past videos our actual life that
being perfect doesn't exist so if you're
afraid of something that doesn't even
exist
shouldn't you be questioning yourself
and taking a step back and saying what
am I even afraid of are you afraid of
progressing developing learning growing
becoming successful achieving your goals
reaching your dreams because those all
sound like pretty great things to me
you're the one who decides you've failed
so who cares what anyone around you
thanks did you guys know that Michael
Jordan was kicked out of his high school
basketball team because his coach
thought he didn't have enough skill
Michael Jordan the legendary basketball
player of our era but he kept going
because even though he failed in high
school he didn't give up and when you
think about it the worst case scenario
probably won't even matter in a few days
maybe a week maybe a month but it's
gonna have taught you a lesson and it's
gonna be beneficial for you in the
future so now I want to urge you guys to
share your personal stories of when
you've went through failure and how it
helped you and you can use the caption
keep going hashtag like a girl I
definitely want to know your point of
view on this matter because I think it's
very important and I think it's
something that should be addressed and
it breaks my heart to think that people
with such big potential to do such
amazing
things in this world won't be able to
have their voices heard because they're
too scared to follow through with their
passion so keep going let the world know
that failing is okay share the message
as loud as you can use keep going
hashtag like a girl use it everywhere
tweet it Instagram it commented down
below
screaming out loud in the middle of the
classroom I don't know what it takes
because if I can help you guys and you
guys can help people around you and they
can help everyone around them then this
message is gonna go worldwide it's gonna
spread like wildfire and everyone's
gonna realize that failing is OK and
they're gonna come out with such amazing
things to change this world and make it
such a better place I'm getting out of
breath I'm very excited about it but
thank I so much for watching this video
I hope I could help you in any way if I
did let me know I love you guys so much
all the way to Pluto and that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
