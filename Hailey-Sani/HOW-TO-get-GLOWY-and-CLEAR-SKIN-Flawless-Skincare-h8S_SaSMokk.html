going to be filming a skincare video and
this is literally my most requested view
because you guys always asked me how you
keep your skin so clear why don't you
ever have pimples like what I do with
your skin so no worries I'm here to
share my favorite products with you guys
all the products that are in my skincare
routine right now are my absolute Holy
Grail products I'm set with them I
guarantee you that if you buy one of
these items and try them out you're
gonna fall in love with them there's no
chance you're not going to like them if
you don't like them send your PayPal
I'll literally refund you your money I'm
not even kidding I'm going to be putting
all the names of the products right here
in all the prices right here and they're
going to be linked in the downbar so i
got you the first product is my absolute
favorite product currently it is the
Clinique take the day off cleansing balm
it literally feels like a lip balm
that's the texture 1/2 except you can
put it all over your face
so you slather your face in this and you
can slosh it into your skin when I first
use it I was like this literally isn't
doing anything I don't feel my makeup
coming off because this works so like
gently that it can't like have taken off
all my makeup and then risk my face I
literally look at it and I go there is
not a single gram of makeup left on my
face like it took all of it off so
gently like it literally felt like it
wasn't working but it was it was working
wonders I definitely do think I have
sensitive skin so if you're afraid of
trying new products out because you also
have sensitive skin don't be afraid of
this it's not harsh at all if you're a
lazy gal that doesn't want to go through
a whole skincare routine you just want
to take your makeup off and go to bed
and you only want to be using one
product this is it another product that
I've been using for years now is the
Bioderma h2o water and h2o and water the
same thing it's the cleansing water
specimen space this is also perfect for
sensitive skin is so gentle and I just
like to put a little bit on the pad and
it takes all my makeup off sometimes I
like to wipe my face with this to remove
some excess dirt if I have any this is
also a really easy product so if you
don't like using a lot of products and
you just want to get your skincare
routine over with just put them on a pad
wipe your whole thing and you don't have
to worry about anything else if you want
to have clear skin you have to make sure
that your skin is clean all the time you
don't want any dirt and bacteria which
can obviously lead us to like ask
simple so this is a cleansing water so
that's basically what it does it just
make sure your face is clean even if you
don't have any makeup on it amazes me
how even if I'm not wearing makeup that
day and I come home and I wipe my face
with this with a pad I still get a lot
of dirt on the pad because of all the
dirt that collects on my face throughout
the day which is kind of gross but it's
the truth there is no chance you miss
this product on YouTube it's the Mario
Badescu rose water spray this just makes
my skin breathe I feel like ever since I
started using this product my face has
been a lot more clear
owls really good for your skin and rose
water is also really good for your skin
this was like my eighth bottle but right
now no one's having a really good deal
on them so you should definitely go
check North them out they have some
amazing sales going on that's where I
got on my skin care products recently
after step three I move on to step 4
which is moisturization which is also
very important you never want to let
your skin get dry because then you'll
look really crusty and nobody wants that
the moisturizer I use is the Clinique
dramatically different moisturizing gel
this is the gel there's also a lotion
but I like the gel a lot more because it
leaves my skin feeling a lot more fresh
because the gel adds like a cooling
effect which I really like I'm almost
running out of this one so I got my own
back and I purchased a backup already
step 5 another very important thing are
your eyes who wants like really wrinkly
eyes when they're older you know make
sure you got yourself ahead of time so
when you hit your thirties you're not
dealing with a bunch of wrinkles so I
use an eye illusion to keep that area
hydrated and this is cleaning all about
eyes for me my problem area are my under
eyes because they're always really dark
and really puffy and I absolutely hate
it even if I get 12 hours of sleep
they'll still be dark and poufy so I
like to try to reduce them as much as I
can so this also reduces circles and
plus this is actually the travel size I
think I need to get my hand on the big
size because it's almost just finished
this video literally looks like it's
sponsored by Clinique I promise you is
not I wish they founder me because I'm
obsessed with their product tulo
Clinique this is a Clinique rinse off i
makeup solvent so if I'm wearing a lot
of heavy eye makeup which is very rare
I'll make sure to take all of it off
using some of this and even though I
like that I do have clear skin thank the
Lord thank the universe knock on wood
I swear I'm gonna get seven pimples
tomorrow sometimes I do get seven
pimples when I get those I like to thank
this product it's the Mario Badescu
drying lotion and this works wonders if
I could only recommend one product to
get rid of both it would be this one I
love it my mom loves it my sister loves
it everybody loves it because it works
so well in most cases if I have a pimple
I'll put this on with a q-tip overnight
and it will be gone by the morning
sometimes it takes two nights if it's a
really annoying pimple works better than
toothpaste works better than ice like
just put this on your pimple and I
promise you and we'll all be okay if
it's kind of a night where I want to
pamper myself and feel like I'm in a
fresh new layer of skin I'll kind of
give myself a little spa day I guess and
I'll exfoliate my skin because
exfoliating is really important it just
makes sure you get rid of all the dead
skin I talked about these two products
in my lap skincare routine and I still
live by them they're both from lush and
just the ocean salt and I feel like salt
is so good for your skin like I was in
the ocean or like to see actually the
whole summer and my skin has been so
clear like I don't even think I got a
single pimple throughout this whole trip
because I was swimming the whole time I
don't know I'm not a dermatologist but
if you have a lot of pimples maybe try
like playing around some salt like salt
water like salt scrubs or stuff like
that I'm sure it'll work so yeah I guess
some of this rub it on my face for a
little and then rinse it off this one
basically the same thing but it's for
your lips and this one you can eat
because it just tastes so good finally
I'll finish off with a Mac this is the
last mask i use and i really liked it if
by the brand dis cocaine and it's the
illuminating diamond peel-off mask it
looks like this white lotion but when
you put on your face i swear it's like
glitter and it's so fun to peel off to
and i use this like two nights ago and
left my skin feeling so hydrated and so
glowy
I think this masks actually called I do
care but still do get it like dewy yeah
I thought it was funny I just realized
there's a lot of new products that I
haven't used yet that I kind of to haul
for you guys but now I kind of want to
film
video lights full face of first
impression skincare Edition I have so
many products that I've never tried let
me know in the comments if you would
like that but we have come to the end of
this video those are pretty much all the
products I use like I said I don't use
them all the time because I feel like if
you just like drain your face in a bunch
of products your face and never going to
get a chance to breathe sometimes it
just needs to do its own thing so
definitely don't try to bury your face
under a lot of chemicals but just for
this video guys I hope you guys enjoyed
it and I love you guys so much all the
way scepter toe and pack I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
