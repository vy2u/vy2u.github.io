hate this and we only get to find out
after I finish family very exciting
video and I never thought I would even
be filming this video I don't know I
just thought this day would never
actually arrive like five years later
maybe but I'm gonna be filming my
100,000
giveaway 100,000 subscriber giveaway 100
I gotta kind of repeat it over and over
again so I can at least pretend I
believe myself
one hundred a thousand and I'm so
excited for this video because I never
had a giveaway on my channel which kind
of sounds really bad I'm really sorry
for that but it's because I live in
stupid Turkey and like there's like
nothing here didn't give away literally
if I were talking giveaway while living
here I suppose even giving away actual
turkeys I actually got an idea from a
subscriber and that was to purchase the
items online and just ship them to them
directly without having to like go out
and buy it and store myself because if I
were to do that in Turkey I'd be broke
they sell everything here like three
times the actual price that it costs all
around the world the giveaway is
actually going to be in three parts
there's gonna be a YouTube Instagram and
Twitter giveaway it's very easy to enter
them all before talking about the rules
that it's a little like really quickly
you tell the prizes because they are
amazing and you guys are so lucky to win
them because I'm kind of jealous I
actually don't have some of these things
I don't have any of these things myself
so the YouTube portion of the giveaway
is gonna have two winners I'm gonna be
giving away an iPad Mini which is like
crazy here is the one lucky person
that's gonna win that and the second
YouTube winner is gonna be winning a
Polaroid camera and you get to like
decide to color yourself and to enter
the YouTube portion of this giveaway all
you have to do is be subscribed to me
and comment down below one back school
video that you would like to see on my
channel
my back school series is gonna be--start
very good very soon and I have it this
big collab coming up with like a bunch
of other youtubers and the Instagram and
winner-winner you're gonna be in winning
a Naked palette and again you get to
decide at which Naked palette you want
it to be for the Instagram version is
you have to be subscribed to my channel
because for my subscribers and be follow
me on Instagram this is the photo that
you have to comment on and just comment
your favorite memory from this summer
move it onto the sweater portion of this
giveaway go and tweet something with the
hashtags BPL 100k giveaway and the
hashtag just comment your favorite emoji
because wow I'm so creative with these
roles this giveaway is international so
if you live in on Tortuga go ahead and
enter a little miss polar bear if you're
under the age of 18 which I'm probably
guessing you are make sure you ask your
parents because I don't like send you an
iPad and then your friends are like oh
you cannot have it throw it away and
then I would be like so yeah that's all
I have to do for the YouTube you have to
like comment subscribe for the Instagram
subscribe comment on that Instagram
photo for the Twitter follow me on
Twitter subscribe and comment something
with a hashtag EPL 1 or 2 can't give
away and your favorite emoji and that's
it
I want to say thank you to everyone that
subscribes to me got 100k I'm getting a
silver play button I'm probably gonna be
like staring at it like 24/7 and guys I
just want to thank y'all so much you
kind of made me who I am today without
YouTube I would be a 1 weird girl I
can't even imagine myself without
YouTube like YouTube is such a big part
of my life therefore you guys are such a
big part of my life and I don't like my
fans or like my subscribers you're kind
of like my friends I always try to reply
to you I always try to reply to your DMS
I want to thank everything like fan
account
this actually happened twice two of my
subscribers actually saw me while I was
walking out on the street and like they
came up to me and they're like hey and I
can't even like god that makes me feel
like I'm no way ends August 31st you can
enter all three of the giveaways it
doesn't matter just do your thing
tell your friend make a grandma enter
the giveaway maybe if she wins the iPad
you can just steal her from her the
