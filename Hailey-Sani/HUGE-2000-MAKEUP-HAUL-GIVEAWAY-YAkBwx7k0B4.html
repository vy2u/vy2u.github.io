that you want to snack on them
throughout the day this is a regular
chocolate bar palette this is the
semi-sweet chocolate bar palette and
since I'm gonna be giving away some of
these I'm not gonna swatch everything
because I doubt you guys want my
fingerprints on your eyeshadow so this
is the regular one this is the
semi-sweet one it's like dark chocolate
milk chocolate this is the semi-sweet
one it's kind of like softer colors and
the regular one is a little bit darker
maybe I'm just making that up moving on
they gave me the sweet peach palette and
the peach is like another collection of
theirs taste like peaches and cream
again yummy I actually have one of these
so hint hint giveaway they gave me the
chocolate bon bons palette and then
finally they gave me the chocolate gold
and they gave me a lot of like their
gold themed collection and I'm so
excited for that cuz your girl loves
some gold it reminds me of Willy Wonka
and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory oh
girl
how're Marie these are oh it's so pretty
holy Frick a1 they gave me a ton of
their peach lipsticks so this is mine
it's my absolute favorite shade from
their peach collection I'll swatch it
it's like the perfect natural
Ankush nude color I wear all the time so
I also got a couple of those how do you
film a beauty haul and I supposed to
like read their shades they literally
gave me so many I think I'm gonna swatch
some of my favorite ones this one is
called sex on the peach get it it looks
like a pretty mouth color there so like
creamy and soft they kind of look a
little similar this one's a little bit
darker I want to swatch it this one it's
in the shade peach peach I feel like
they should do a collaboration with like
Mario and like have like Princess Peach
be one of their like palette huh that is
the perfect summer color I'm so excited
to try these on let's see if I'm gonna
have any space on my hands after this
videos over this one's in the shade muy
caliente and I really want to try it
looks like a pretty red such a fiery red
I kind of like to see a hint of hot pink
in there too it's that one right there
it's gorgeous
next up I got some products for coverage
because I love they're like concealers
and stuff so she matched me and gave me
two shades one for when I'm tan and one
for like during the winter time so right
now I like to use the color light I have
it under my eyes right now
it's their Born This Way concealer it
just like blends really easily and for
when I'm tan she gave me the shade warm
medium where did my foundation and then
for foundation I also got two shades
this is in the shade almond for when I'm
lighter and for when I'm tan she gave me
a warm beige no you're lying
a brow pencil that's brownie flavored so
I got four brow pencils and from this
side to that side they're in soft Brown
taupe deep Brown in Auburn I'm like a
soft brown or I'm a big deep brown
actually I think I'm gonna go for the
soft brown one it just looks like that
and on the other side it's a cute little
brush okay I'm super excited for these
these are like their gold related
products so apparently this literally
has the real gold infused inside the
gloss
bruh they're going big on the gold so
this is just pure gold I don't really
want to open this Oh body glitter this
is gonna be so pretty for like Coachella
speaking of Coachella they gave me a ton
of these like insane colored peel-off
glitter liners and I was like peel off
what does that mean is it like a sticker
like stick it on but no you apply it as
if you were just applying liquid liner
but after it's been on your eyelid for a
while it like turns into a sticker and
at the end of the day you can like peel
it off your eyelid I want to try the
blue one because I'm half mermaid that's
the name of the shade literally though
she's gorgeous that's what it looks like
on my hand it's just like a really
pretty sparkly teal let's wait for it to
dry for a bit and then we'll come back
to that and this one is magenta it's in
the shade kitty glitter apparently you
have to wait five minutes for it I've
got two of their shadow insurances
because this is my favorite eyeshadow
primer like literally keeps your
eyeshadow on for the longest time I
didn't see this until now and now that I
read the name of it I'm really excited
for it
so it's again their sweet peach
collection and it's a creamy peach oil
lip gloss I'm really diggin that like
glowy natural look so anything that's
like a cute gloss I'm into it and this
looks like something I'm gonna love I'm
just so excited more brow so this is a
quickie brow it's like one of those
things that you like brush over your
brow to give it a little bit more
definition I really am NOT ready to show
you guys 7,000,000 melted matte it's
crazy it just keeps going this is
personally my favorite melted matte and
it's not even like a melted matte it's
just there leer gloss gives you the
perfect Lois glossy like lips I got a
couple you know on sand this is in the
shade sell out I wanna just watch her
really quick because I feel like it's
the prettiest shade like how pretty is
that
they smell like cupcakes bro this is
like a while at color and it's in the
shade Queen beef this one looks really
pretty too it's in the shade child star
this one is hilarious it's a glow job
glitter face mask glitter face mask I
yes that's what the packaging looks like
it's a magical universe what can you see
that I need to try this out and let you
guys know how my skin feels after it
even as this didn't like do anything for
my skin I would literally still put it
on every night just because it's like a
magical universe on my face this is the
sweet peach glow so I'm guessing it's
something that has to do with
highlighter your girl loves a good
highlighter a blush set and it smells
like peaches I got a couple blushes
because I'm obsessed with their blushes
I wear all the time I'm wearing it right
now
and my favorite shade is justify my love
so I got a couple of these I don't want
to open them up because I do want to
give them away to you so I'm just gonna
grab mine real quick it just looks like
a little heart and I feel like it's the
perfect like pink color this one's like
a peachy coral it's in the shade I will
always love you
this one is really pretty I actually do
want to open this up it's in the shade
baby love and I love natural-looking
blushes like this one oh yes look how
pretty that looks
this product is called peach my cheeks
it's a melting powder blush I'm not
gonna touch it just because I already
have these it just looks like this it's
like a cream blush and I know these
lasts a long time
oh I got some more cream blushes this is
the sweetie pie matte bronzer matte this
looks sparkly as hell and this is the
peach blur translucent powder I live
very good powder oh I have this too I
think I've used it in a video actually
I'm pretty sure it's an all over the
face thing it kind of just looks pink to
add it like a healthy glow oh I'm super
excited for this this is the Born This
Way setting powder people and YouTube
literally rave about this I have to do
it okay I got a lot of their mascara
because their mascaras are my favorite
mascaras they're better than sex mascara
saved my life I have it on my eyelashes
all the time and people always ask me
where I get my eyelash extensions from
and I go my mascara all things to these
guys I think I have like seven of these
now best mascara ever create
and I didn't know they had a waterproof
version of the same mascara that's just
crazy because you know I'm a mermaid
speaking of that they have this product
called the mascara melt off and
apparently it's like a cleansing oil
easily takes off your mascara no matter
if it's like waterproof or not it looks
like a mascara wand but like with very
very tiny bristles that's hella cool
this is the hangover primary that you
apply before you put on your makeup and
it just makes it last all throughout
whatever you're doing okay this is
exciting this is an innovation right
here it looks like a regular makeup
brush right super soft cute whatever but
it comes with this like elastic and when
you move it up you can turn it into a
contour brush because now you just like
meet the bristles dense and you can use
it to contour make it really oh well I
guess you can't and then you just stick
it back in from the back what else we
got this is the hangover setting spray
so if you apply the primer followed by
this after you put on your makeup
like you're gonna have permanent makeup
this is the peach mist this is similar
to that it's just from their peach
collection the only thing is with this
it has my particles of powder inside it
so before you use it you have to shake
it really well or else you'll have like
blotchy powder on your face which I mean
if that's a look you go for this is
their just peachy matte it's just a
bunch of like warm toned mattes
I think it's been five minutes so we can
peel off the like peel off liner now but
it does leave like a stain so it's not
like a sticker what are you girl you're
pretty this is a glowy bronzer it
literally looks like a box of chocolates
you would get at like Austria or
something Wow doesn't smell like
chocolate that's kind of sad I want to
swatch I think it's lighter on this side
and then darker on that side your girl
had to grab herself a couple chocolates
delays I have a regular chocolate Soleil
forever like I'd buy it over and over
again but I didn't know they came out
with so many like different types of
chocolate Soleil bronzers so I used like
medium deep one they also came out with
a milk chocolate
Salei so this one's lighter look at me
being a beauty guru so this is lightest
and then that is darkest the milk
chocolate compared to the dark chocolate
you can definitely tell the difference
and this is the chocolate gold Soleil
which does that even mean it's like the
chocolate Soleil but it's really
shimmery so they have a different line
for their highlighters this is the love
light this one's like in a gold color
I've never really tried a gold
highlighter I want to see what that
looks like it's in the shade you light
up my life really pretty packaging I dig
it I think I went over everything I know
it was pretty quick but we got a lot of
makeup out here so if I went through
every single thing I feel like this
would be like a 2-hour video look at my
hand kind of funny starting off with the
giveaway so there are gonna be four
