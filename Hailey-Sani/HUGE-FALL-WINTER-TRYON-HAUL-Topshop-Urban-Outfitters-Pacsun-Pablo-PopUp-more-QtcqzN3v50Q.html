dipping for the stereo stereo hey guys
it's either here and today I'm gonna be
filming a huge collective fall try on
haul I went shopping at Urban Outfitters
Topshop Zara Paxton forever 21 and I
picked up some really cute clothes to
add to my fall / winter closet so that
further ado let's get started let's get
started let's get started so when we
starting off with Topshop which has been
one of my favorite places to shop out
recently and I've been really digging
the new velvet trend so I picked up two
velvet items the first item is this
cropped velvet sweater and I think it's
like crushed velvet material because
there was like different tones of velvet
it almost looks like metallic velvet and
I really like how it knots down right
here in the bottom and has like a slight
turtleneck the second thing I got was
this a velvet sweater and I thought it
was black when I got it but I came home
and it turned out to be navy but I'm
fine with that the main reason I bought
this was because it was so comfy when I
tried it on at the store it's really
baggy like in the arms and in the
stomach area and then it tightens and
the ends so it gives like this really
cute oversized effect which I really
like and then the other two items I got
were more toward the leather trend so
this one is a leather jacket with a fur
collar obviously both faux and I'm in
love with this red collar it's more like
a maroon red and I think the contrast
between this color and leather is like
amazing and then I got a pair of booties
they have buckles going all the way down
and then studs and they're like really
edgy every time I wear them I get
compliments on them and they make a
really cute clicking noise when I walk
so I really like wearing them I really
wanted a pair of edgy booties so that's
why I decided to go with these so next
up I'm going to be moving on to urban
outfitters so the first thing I got at
Urban Outfitters was this flannel and
its really soft actually got this from
the men's section and it has like these
white blotches going all around the
plant which adds like a bleached effect
that I really really like and I really
love flannels and I
like in this pattern so I said to
purchase this and then I got another
bummer it's not like I already have 67
bombers but this one's really
interesting it's like all orange inside
and it's the softest material ever and
it also has an orange hood and I don't
have any bombers with hoods
again every time I wear I get so many
compliments on it the hood is actually
removable if you want to remove it and
then I got a really classic item from
Urban Outfitters I got the Calvin Klein
cropped sweatshirt and it's also
sleeveless so I got this is like a vest
I don't know it's really casual really
comfy and really cute the next one can
be showing items from is packs on I
would really like impacts and recently
they've been really branching out with
the different brands that they sell so I
think that's a really nice of them they
should definitely keep that up the first
thing I got was again another classic
item is the adidas black crop hoodie
with their logo I like to wear this when
I don't feel like dressing up with like
leggings and sneakers and it's perfect
and then recently they had a buy one get
one 50% off denim deal online so I took
advantage of that and got two pairs of
jeans the first pair is from the Kendall
+ Kylie collection so they look like
normal distress like boyfriend jeans but
the ends are like extra distress which
is what I really like about them they
look really cute and then the second
pair of jeans I got were these like blue
denim jeans but they're like really mom
jeans and they're high-waisted and I
didn't have high-waisted mom jeans I
don't know how many jeans in general so
whenever I see some cute ones on sale I
definitely like to purchase some and
then I got a pair of the high-top
classic vans and let me tell you this I
did not know bands were so difficult to
wear like it eliminates takes me six
years to put on bands like it's so
difficult for me to fit my foot through
this next up I think I'm going to move
on to Zara
so from Zara I bought another pair of
jeans and these are gray jeans and
they're really edgy and I've been really
into like edging my look up lately
edging my look up okay so they look like
this they have really big large holes
right where your knees are supposed to
be at they're kind of like loose on me
but I like it like that because it adds
like an oversized nice fitting vibe to
your outfit so
yeah I got another pair shoes and I just
realized I'm sure just three traits or
seasons halt my shoe call like I don't
know so they're these velvet booties and
they're so cute like they're so cute
like I'm gonna wear them today they're
really comfy to walk in it's on like too
big of a keel so it's uh ideal for a
perfect date night or even for going to
school ha ha I bought them because I
feel like they'll go with a lot of
outfits and make any outfit look cuter
so have you haven't caught up with my
idea here I just like to buy cute items
to make not cute outfits cute and then
I've got a backpack and this is a maroon
color quilted backpack with chain
detailing and leather straps that
fashion language though and it also has
like zippers on the sides which have
like more extra room so I'm gonna be
moving on to forever 21 and I don't shop
there as much but I did go there like
last weekend and picked out some cute
clothes and let's be real here I kind of
like di ride them so that's why they're
cute now so I got this band tee and it
says Bob Seger I love him so much
fallen on Spotify it was like a really
ugly big van T and what I did was I
cropped it I distressed it so now it's
like really trendy really vintage so
cute hmm and then I got this sweater
from the men's section all these clothes
are from the men's section because I
like to dress like a boy and then I got
this white sweater and has the American
flag because I'm so American you guys
know me I'm not foreign at all and this
was also like a really oversized sweater
but I just chop that cut it cut it cut
it
and then in the back it has this black
huge square filled with the names of a
bunch of different countries go there so
you should walk behind me if you want to
catch up on your geography and then I
got another flannel it's not like I
already had 85 flannels but this one I
like because again it's oversized and
then I don't have a red and black
flannel and just went
what comes with a hood so I like
flannels that you can also wear as like
a jacket so like to keep warm because
it's the fall time it's getting colder
here in California also it adds to my
email collection the next thing is not
actually from a store I mean it's
technically a store but like it was
really crazy like a friend came through
and gave me the password for the Kanye
West pop-up shop online
Pablo supply shop calm thing so I pay
$60 for a Gildan t-shirt because I learn
materialistic society okay anyways what
was I saying
why does it look blue on camera it's
more like a turquoise green aquamarine
color and then it says Miami right here
and then the back it says I feel like
Pablo it's basically the color of the
Miami Dolphins Miami Dolphins probably
embarrass myself when he not man he
Miami Dolphins
okay I'm going Black Friday shopping
tomorrow anyways I think guys so much
for watching this video if you like
hauls let me know because your girl go
shopping like a lot because looking like
so much all the way to Prudhoe and back
a buy a body up ripping foot of stereo
