guessed it we're back at it we're doing
another unboxing video because you guys
are really really light movies and I
love filming them but this video I'm
most excited to ever film I think it's
my favorite like are like most excited
I've been to film a PR slash online
store like just basically an unboxing
haul because the brand's we have in here
are crazy like this box from covergirl I
can fit into and then we've got some Too
Faced we got a ton of Urban Decay
packages and just like everything I'm
super excited for and you guys always
know I always have giveaways in these
videos so since there are so many things
definitely expect one but yeah without
further ado let's get started if you're
not already obviously subscribe because
we do these every once in a while and if
you want to get your hands on some
goodies stay tuned okay the first
package we have here is from princess
Polly but I didn't order them directly
off of that I ordered them off of this
app called dope and this video is not
sponsored I just really like them I
worked with them before not even work
with them I've literally just hung out
with that brand it's like a shopping app
so there's like a ton of stores and you
add things to your cart so it's one cart
but you can add things from multiple
stores and then check out all at once
pretty Doh and I always have giveaways
on that app because there's like the
people that work they're just amazing
and they're always like hey you want to
do a giveaway and I'm like sure so the
first thing I got was this black bathing
suit so it just looks like this and then
it's a low back I just want to have one
of these for around the spring/summer
time and then the second thing I got was
this dress it kind of looks big I'm not
gonna lie but it's just this like Brad
Floral flowy dress I think having
dresses during the summer is literally
the go-to just because it's so hot
everywhere I travel to even here in LA
it just gets so hot and like you look
cute without trying and also like not
having a lot of like material like
touching your skin and those were the
two things I got from princess Polly the
next thing we have here is from
decay and it says you're gonna look hot
yes I really wanted this so this is the
Urban Decay Naked petit heat palette
let's take a look so it's just like a
mini eyeshadow palette ooh oh there Matt
yes that's what the colors look like
they're very like warm toned I'm
definitely gonna be using this watch
just because I prefer matte eyeshadow a
lot better to like shimmery so thank you
for this Urban Decay I wanted to open
these two packages together because
they're from the same company so they're
called Frankie Phoenix but they also
have a jewelry line called Lola
Chronicle and they were like hey we want
to send you some goodies and they're
also hosting a giveaway so you can win
two $100 gift cards the details for that
will be in the description box but
basically I think you just have to
follow me and then on Instagram and then
you are entered to win two $100 gift
cards so these are from Frankie Phoenix
which is their clothing line oh my god
so cute okay we're about to die so first
thing is this really soft and flowy
black tank I love things like this for
spring because like I said it's really
light so you're not gonna be sweating so

pants they're striped they're a wide-leg
oh my god these are gonna look so cute
with like a bralette this is a really
cute thank you

yellow sundress and then the back has
like a triangle cutout I think that's
adorable they sent me some lace bralette

literally hate wearing bras like I'm
wearing a sports bra right now I think
bras are so uncomfortable and bra let's

your skin and then like blends into your
skin how cool is that so you're

coverage in your perfect shade so I'll
link them down below guys you don't have

whoever got me on the Urban Decay PR
list thanks
oh my god this is crazy oh my god always
munch try these
I remember YouTube like in 2013 when
everyone was obsessed with these Urban
Decay glide on pencils and it's all I
ever wanted and like now they're like
sending it to me that's cute
hailey has grown and then they also send
me there a special effect of mascara so
these are like crazy colored mascara and

the like back in the day
Wow desk you think you Orban decay you
guys actually I'm gonna be doing a
little bit of a giveaway of these but
I'll do it on my Instagram so after you
watch this go look at my Instagram
there's only gonna be a post talking
about my giveaway hello beautiful
it comes with cables so it's this like
oh what does my face tell you does it
say that I'm vain
my face this is insane
like this is taking you to a whole new
level like I don't know what to do with
this much makeup you think that was done
when I first started doing makeup videos
and like YouTube I would like go to the
drugstore and be like okay I can get
like three things like I have to think
about this really hard like what can I
spend my money on and like now that like
these companies are sending me like this
much makeup and the only reason that all
of this is happening is because of you
guys like you guys chose to follow me
you guys chose to support me and now
these brands think I am capable of
sharing their products with you and
insane I don't know what to do with this
I just want to thank you guys for making
this possible
because I didn't pay for a single thing
in this video I guess it kind of means
that your hard work pays off I worked my
butt off
I still work my butt off to try to get a
video out to try and it wasn't always
like this like no brands would send me
anything this is like my fifth year
doing YouTube being dedicated to
something for over like five years it
gets you places and it just it doesn't
have to be just YouTube it doesn't have
to be just I don't know like being an
Instagram or it just literally anything
you do pays off Wow this video didn't
wasn't supposed to take this turn but
I'm not mad about it I'm actually kind
of grateful that it did end up being
this way so I just want to thank all
these brands first of all but mostly you
guys for sticking by me and making this
possible for that eight year old who had
this like a really big dream of one day
having this be her life and now I kind
of like I guess it never ends now I look
at New York Fashion Week and fashion
conferences and working with like
designers and I'm like wow I wish I
could be like that and then if I put in
another five years ten years it doesn't
matter how long if I just put in even
more work that's where I'm gonna find
myself
and you should always be striving to be
a little bit above where you are already
that was a little little inspirational
message I guess to finish off of this
video thank you guys for sticking
through if you wash all the way up to
this point and yeah I love you guys so
much like so much and I'm not just
saying that because like that's my outro
I have to say that like I genuinely care
about you guys because you made this
possible for me thank you
and I'll see you in my next video bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
