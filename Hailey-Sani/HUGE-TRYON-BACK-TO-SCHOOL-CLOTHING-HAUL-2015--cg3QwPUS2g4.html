I'm giving away an iPad cool or camera
and two naked palettes so make sure you
enter that after you watch this video
hi guys it's Ian here and today I'm
gonna be filming a back-to-school
clothing haul and I got some of the
stuff online some of it not online
everything's pretty cute and affordable
kershel excited for bicycle skates in
because I'm gonna be having a huge back
school clock with like 600 other you
guys I'm up hey guys it's like it's a
visa hi everybody Joey hey guys it's me
four up here what's up guys it's Jake
hey guys it is limited guys what is up
its nervous hello everybody it's your
and I'll link other videos and channels
down below the first store is called
Sami dress and they have some really
cute clothes I've like done videos about
them before so the first thing I got was
this shirt and it's I don't even know
how to start this pattern so I'm not
even like attempt to describe it but
basically I feel like it's a shirt that
you would buy for $40 they're like Urban
Outfitters or like three people it has
like the really like gypsy feeling going
on just like my shirt right and it also
has a zipper going down the back and
it's really soft it's like really thin
material so you won't feel like really
sweating inside a and I think it's very
cute the next thing I got was this
romper and it's like grey cotton and
it's super soft I wore this yesterday
and it's so comfy it has a zipper but
you don't have to zip it I like to wear
like a white sports bra under it and
then just leave a zipper open and it
ties in the bottom the only bad thing
about rockers is the fact that you
literally has a strip down while you
just want to pee it brings out that in
or less what a mighty thing the next
thing I got was a necklace and it's this
gold chain with a hoop and a little
metal piece of steak on the other side
after it sounds like County wear this
but then I figured I could just stick
the hole through the circle that's what
she said it looks like this it's very
nice I really like simple pieces of
jewelry like this because they could
turn a basic outfit into something
really cute in little to no effort the
next thing I ordered isn't actually a
clothing item nor is it a bad school
item it's black bikini bottoms because
there's still some time to go in the
pool and like go to the beach and I
thought I seize the opportunity I got
these TV black bottoms and they're
really cheeky and I don't really feel
comfortable ring Chiefy body like in
public moving on I ordered some stuff
from dress scout and dress cow is one of
the most affordable online stores I want
to say like it's the cheapest one I've
ever shopped at and I got so many things
for like less than $50 so I gotta say
it's a bargain
the first shirt I got is this and it
says you are my Sun my moon and all my
stars it's really cute it's backless you
probably saw like the things acting at
random the only difference is the fact
that this is made out of nylon so if you
wear it too long you'll probably start
sweating moving on I got this shirt that
says dancer friends and I actually
wanted this like in a bigger size but
they didn't have one so I have to get
into small because I wanted to be like
really oversized so I could wear it with
like leggings but it's not very
oversized but it's still cute plants are
friends um yeah unites the plants next I
got this shirt and I have no idea what
these kind of shirts are called cold I
want to call it a halter top but I know
it has nothing to do with a halter top
it goes around her
kind of like a necklace or like a choker
a collar whatever and then in the back
it's completely backless and it just has
like this straight line going through it
looks really cute again the materials
nylon so I recommend wearing this like
more or at the nighttime I probably wear
this in the night game anyways it looks
pretty like formal I don't know the next
thing I got is like the cutest thing
ever it it it's a shirt shocker another
shirt but it is so soft it's like it's
it says la lune and yo Soleil which
means Sun Moon I have a lot of likes on
moon plant themed things in this haul
maybe it's just a sign maybe I'm turning
into an what's the word for somebody
that's into Suns and moons and it has
like this really cute graphic design on
it I feel like again it would be
something you would find at Urban
Outfitters but I got it really much
cheaper and that's two things I got were
actually shoes and I don't know if I'm
gonna be waiting in school but I know
that they're nice so they're like chunky
black heels I got this for like nine or
eight dollars it was ridiculous how
cheap it was but obviously for the price
don't expect something that it would be
able to find it like Steve Madden
because they are again like less than
$10 but they're really cute they're
really in fashion and tea right now they
I don't know how to describe this caged
but area with black everywhere
I would really improve my vocabulary cuz
I've been using the words cute and
fashionable like stomach times already
so yeah these are the god
these are those wooden balls these are
bad these are these and then I got
another pair of shoes and these are like
the same what happened to my vocabulary
today these are like the same category
of shoes again they're like the trendy
chunky heel boots I decided to try
something that was slightly out of my
comfort zone by the way guys these are
both enough size 7 because I'm a size 7
if you didn't know now you know what
fact and I finally got this shirt it's
my favorite item in my closet right now
I feel like an Egyptian fairy godmother
goddess princess I don't know I really
like it I think it's called like a
peasant top I'm not sure I think peasant
tops also have sleeves but it's it's
this basically and it's light and I love
it it's and then I got this sweater from
a random store at the mall and it says
Lakers it's not that I'm like a Lakers
fan or anything I don't really know
anything about sports but I like the
sweater I feel like those people that
buy band shirts and then you guys are
all gonna be like and you listen to that
band no you don't have to listen to any
bands or like support any artists or
like any groups or any teams just to be
able to wear the clothing that they have
out there you can wear whatever you want
while your dreams nobody gives a nobody
gives a smurf
you know those sunglasses are like
makeup immunity and Matty Bragg and all
these other cool youtubers have your
little sista y'all got then they are
currently make favorite items in the
world they are bomb I'm actually gonna
be sharing them
my mom that's what she thinks I kind of
already took them and adopted them
already
it came in cute box it's a box
but to love them I don't think I'm gonna
be taking them off anytime soon so I'm
sorry guys we just gotta wait just
kidding so yeah that's that I got these
glasses I love them they don't have
anything to do with school but I thought
I'd show them in studio anyway because
that's what beauty here is do sorry for
the really disgusting setup uh I love
you all so much all the way to put out
there it goes another thing about moons
in this video I swear some extra log
that word thanks for watching me live I
love you also to know I'm back bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
