filming a huge summer haul guys are
probably familiar with that pool by now
because it's been really popular on
YouTube so I was like I want to get my
hands on some of that they have a lot of
really trendy like celebrity designer
items for a lot cheaper so I'm sure
gonna find something in this video
they're gonna fall in love with I'm
going to link their website down below
most of them wear bikinis almost
everything I got is less than $20 so I
got you I'm going to be trying on
motions of things so stay tuned for the
Tryon part there's so many clothes to
show you so I'm just going to get
started so the first thing I got is
something I definitely want to have for
this summer it's just a plain black
simple bathing suit it's just triangle
cut as you can see and then the bonds
are just regular buttons I think this is
perfect for you know just like a simple
bathing suit to have the next way to
suit is kind of similar it's like
against a red triangle Kajal this also
fits like the same way I really like the
fit and makes you look very nice if you
know what I'm saying
and then the bottoms are kind of
different there are a lot more cheeky
but the sides are a little thicker so I
feel like it balances it out and I love
red I've been obsessed with red lately I
just think it's just fire color the next
two bathing suits are the same in
different colors they're basically like
a black top and then it's not it so it
kind of looks like a crop top but you
can wear it to the beach the bottoms are
just simple black bottoms with ties on
the side I really like this texture and
then I got it in white as well because
if you know me you know I get soaked and
summer and if you know you know about
what bathing suits look so good with a
chance this is similar to the first two
I showed it's a baby pink triangle cut
top and it looks really good on and then
it comes with almost like identical to
the red when I believe kingka bottom
these are kind of big on me we're going
to see we're gonna have to grow this
booty so we can fit into this cute ass
bathing suit
this one is a baby blue and again it has
a cotton texture and it has the cutest
top except it's very open so it's a lot
of cleavage it's
to you and you're gonna see on Instagram
so an amazing trend that I've been
seeing going around is in velvet bikini
so I have to get my hand on like a few
can we just talk about how to use this
is again it has the same perfect
triangle fit it's this maroon color was
like taupe lining and it looks so
high-end so classy
I really like the metal detailing and
the size as well I think it looks really
cute velvet and a bikini put together
like my two favorite things a one so I
set so this one is another triangle top
this was in its baby pink and it spelled
it looks cute this one gives me royal by
a s except you just tie them on the
bottoms are also tie up in the sides and
these two together are so cute they're
so precious I don't know if you can
actually go swimming in them like that
would make my heart kind of hurt the
next baby suit is so cute I like it it
gives me Bahama vibe it looks like this
it has like double strap so it's also
try out some sets with the bots there
again black and simple and then the size
it is like all see show so I feel like
so tropical perfect for vacation I'm
gonna be in Greece for a lot of the
summer so you're probably gonna be
seeing like all these bikinis and my
Greece video that's coming up this one I
didn't get to open top looks like this
there's so much of a second when I
showed you except when you tight up
there's like a little key keyhole right
there the bottoms are high waisted and
pink I'm upset 75 yes and then the back
is scrunched up kind of like a Brazilian
cheesy one these are so cute together
I'm not up is one piece and
unfortunately it doesn't fit the way I
wanted to the but it's way too much like
coverage from my liking
at the same time it's really tight so
like grips onto my butt and like this
does not let you at all and then the
back looks pretty nice but the front it
just kind of like pushes everything back
and again it doesn't look attractive at
all so slowly shifting from bikinis to
actual clothing that's why I fall in the
middle because I do get it from the
clothing section if this velvet like
magenta bralette it gives me such as all
vibes and then the bottoms are like boy
shorts I see
supposed to be like loungewear look how
beautiful looks like I can literally
frame it and hang it on the wall and
call it a day
and they're so soft this is my beer I'm
in this all I'm upset I know I'm going
to wear a way too often to the point
where to clothing Haley please stop
wearing that keyboard sometimes with
sleep and it's Tuesday
they look like adidas sweat pants but
they're so fashionable because they're
kind of like why cut and I feel like you
could dress this up so easily and
they're so comfortable on a separate
then the next top is kind of like a
bathing suit cover-up but it's a black
top and then the front you can tie up so
it looks so cute it would look cute with
like a lace bra let with a lot of
jewelry
I got another really trendy chic I am so
it's big skirt and it has tie up on the
sides
its sheer it's flowy and how slits in
the side it looks so designer so then I
got this bodysuit and it looks really
similar to the are you and I won but
that's one's like a million dollars and
I don't have a million dollars so I got
some samples they have a straight tank
look with these really thin spaghetti
straps and spaghetti straps or so a
stain key next I got this little black
skirt and then it has all these tools
like slit it also comes with these
strings so you would string them
together if you like no not often
showing like me then you would tie them
a little tighter but still it's like a
cute look your body can use all night
Instagram or something but there's these
off-the-shoulder crop tops or like
banjos or something and are long sleeves
are so dainty so cute perfect for summer
I got it in black and white the next
item I asked you more in like a past you
want a not so long ago it is this kind
of NIC top again it has like the
off-the-shoulder look luckily it's not
like really thick knit so you can
definitely wear into summer without you
know playing your taste off if you reach
our last item it is a silk dress you tie
it in the front so it kind of focuses a
leather jacket was like you
like a choker oh so cute that was the
end of this hall guys I hope you guys
enjoy that haunt a little my favorite
videos to film if you guys have any
questions about any of the items
definitely comment down below and I'll
make sure to answer that and I love you
guys so much all the way so kudos I'm
done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
