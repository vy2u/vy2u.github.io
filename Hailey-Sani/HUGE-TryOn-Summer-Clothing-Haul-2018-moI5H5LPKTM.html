fun time oh and it came with this hey
guys it's Hayley sunny and today I'm
gonna be filming a huge literally huge
so many things in this haul I can't wait
to show you guys every single thing
Tryon summer haul because I'm super
excited I'm gonna be traveling this
summer so I thought I'd stock up and
some like really cute fit and that's
exactly what I did every single thing in
this haul is so cute and I'm gonna try
everything on so you guys know what it
looks like on etc I don't want to make
this intro too long so let's go ahead
and get started I want to start off with
a brand redone you might have seen them
on Instagram for their really famous
like vintage Levi's jeans that all the
models always rock so they actually send
me a few things and I have been wearing
them all the time so this you might have
seen on my Instagram I'll insert a
picture right here of me wearing it but
they're just these like vintage blue
high-waisted Levi's jeans and then
they're known for their like white tag
in the background so they're super high
waisted they hug my waist really tightly
and then it looks good on your butt
makes your booty pop in and then the
pants are kind of like longer they're
not like flare pants they kind of have
like I don't know like a mom Jean vibe
towards the end but I really dig them I
really like these and I got these in the
size 24 the next jeans are also super
cute they're also in a size 24 but these
ones don't really fit me that well
they're kind of tight on the booty but
they're just these like black vintage
Levi's denim high-waisted jeans and they
definitely have that like a mom Jean
vibe today I wish this fit me a little
bit better I ended up giving these to
know and she rocks them with like every
outfit and then they sent me this cute
little shirt that like very soft you can
throw it on over everything it just has
their logo says region I like to wear
these like over Jean
what I'm not stressing and it's just the
cute little top to have and then finally
they sent me one of their champion
vintage hoodies so this is just like a
plain gray hoodie I like to wear this
but I'm just chillin I usually were like
oversized hoodies but this one's kind of
like fitted which I've never had it
makes your outfit look more put together
just because you don't look like a big
bag but yeah again it's super soft gray
hoodie to have when you're chilling with
the homies so that's everything I got
from redone I'll link every single thing
in this haul in the downbar so you can
check it out definitely check out
Rihanna if you're looking for some good
like super good quality Levi's jeans cuz
you're gonna find something that you
like on there next up we have this brand
called Toby I went hectic on there got
so many things because I was just
obsessed with every single thing that I
saw on the website so I'm gonna be
shooting eyes all those nothing is too
expensive on there and everything's like
very trendy like once I start showing
you some things you're gonna be like
whoa that's so cute what the Frick the
first thing I got was this flowy black
crop top and it has these cute little
cherries on it I think like the whole
cherry vibe is such like it makes every
outfit looks so much cuter it's such a
cute addition so yeah I've got this like
black little flowy crop top I can't get
over this next piece I want to wear it
in every outfit so it's this gingham
material I feel like I always say it
wrong just like black checkered
basically and then it kind of looks like
overalls are like a bodysuit and it's
actually not it's literally just a dress
it has a cute little bell its zippered
and then it has like this little collar
but I think it's the cutest thing ever
like whoever designed this deserves an
award like how is this next up again
this is very like a profession I got
this white chiffon collared tie up shirt
I definitely think I'm gonna wear this
was like a bralette or something but
it's so flowy like I can't wait to be by
the beach wearing this and just like the
wind blowing oh my god why am i
fantasizing about the
it's really sharp but it's super cute I
feel like you could wear this with like
those blue jeans I showed earlier and it
would be such a cute little like
American vintage vibe the next item is a
little wild a little cray
so it's this cheetah print skirt and I
actually wore this to my after prom when
I was getting lit and it's so cute I
think it's such an adorable skirt I wear
it with like a black bodysuit and it's
like sexy and I really have been
dabbling with like wild prints lately I
don't know stepping out of my comfort
zone for the summer next up we have this
little jean skirt
and again I feel like it's kind of
high-waisted it like wraps around your
waist and I think it's so cute with the
little snake belt and everything such a
vibe again I wear this with like a
bodysuit and it's kind of sure it's so
cute I would be like this the next thing
we have here is this cute little plaid
schoolgirl skirt and I really like the
color like that it's periwinkle it's
such a cute skirt especially for the
summer with like a white top just very
easygoing flowy and I really like the
schoolgirl vibe I think it's so cute oh
and by the way every single thing I got
is in the size extra small just for
reference the next thing is this
off-the-shoulder black top and the
sleeves are like bell sleeves but they
have slits also it's very classy I don't
think these were a set but I felt like I
would wear a shirt with these pants so
they're like these pant material and
they're super highways said they
literally go all the way like up your
ribs and then they flare out like
bell-bottoms and then they also have
slits in the bottom so that's why I
thought this would be like a cute set to
wear together especially since this is
high waisted and this is cropped I feel
like it would look like some kind of
like jumps to almost I actually didn't
pick this out they sent it to me but
it's a bathing suit it's a one-piece
it's red really cute and then the back
is like low back very cheeky and then
the bottoms are high waisted so they sit
on your hips which is very Kylie Jenner
like so yeah I'm probably gonna be
wearing this
summer when I'm 10 and my Beach except
we have this cream off white colored
suede skirt it ties up in the middle
right here where he a scandalous and
then has two little pockets in the front
and then the back is just simple I don't
know what I'd wear this with maybe like
a black bodysuit but I like having a lot
of skirts I think the skirts are really
cute in the summer the whole winter I'm
like hibernating in my sweatpants and my
sweatshirts and then in the summer I
actually like start looking like a girl
again which is just such a fun time and
then the last item from toby is also a
skirt it's this like really floral I
would always think floral was like tacky
back in the day but now I really do that
so this one was just this like mustard
yellow I feel like if you're wearing
floral you need to be simple with the
rest of your outfit or else you're gonna
look like a circus show so definitely
something like just a white crop top or
this is like pinks in it so maybe like a
pink crop top and that's everything I
got from Toby so I'll link everything I
got again in the downbar thank you to
Toby for having the cutest clothes ever
I'm so excited to rock them this
upcoming season so I got two pairs of
shoes from zcd Mont rail and you might
have seen them on like again the models
on Instagram because they always a
rocking shoes like this so they're like
this white leather material and then
they have these like one big strap going
across is so cute and it's white I
wanted the shoes like this that will go
with every outfit cuz I don't want to
have to bring like so many pairs of
shoes with me when I'm traveling and
then the second pair I got is kind of
like like a spin on them they're kind of
similar but they look like this again
it's the strap but it's like a furry
strap and it's super soft and then it's
really interesting in the back so it's
like a slide on you know when you get
blisters in the back of your shoes so
you like started stepping on them that's
kind of like the vibe that they gave it
but I'm pretty sure there's supposed to
be slides with just like a design I
think you can wear them like that but I
like to wear them as slides because
slider in my opinion
the best inventions I love slides
they're so easy but like have you ever
seen such fancy slides you know I'm
saying so thank you to Z CD Mario and
these will be in the downbar so next up
I got this cute little bag from this
brand called Anki and yang and Jax do
you like it so it looks like this it's
really interesting I've never had a bag
that looks like this
and it came with this little scarf
attached to it which I'm pretty sure you
can take off but I kind of liked it
I feel like it's really bougie and like
really like Monte Carlo so yeah it looks
like this it has like this one strap
going down so I got this bag from egg
geunyang and they have a bunch of like
bags all super super high quality and
they actually sent this to me and I'm so
excited to bring it on my trip because
it's such a neutral color that I feel
like would go with everything thank you
too ain't eating and I'm gonna obviously
include the link in the downbar I went a
little ham at Zara and I say that
because Zara has a good quality things
that are really really cute for prices
aren't as like crazy as like Nordstrom
or Topshop so I know a little damage
there I'm gonna admit the lady at the
checkout was like holy this girl
got a lot of stuff and everyone behind
me in line was like can you hurry the
Frick up because like we have places to
be but it's all for the good gives my if
it's gonna be popular okay so I got this
little white cream dress very flowy and
simple I'm such a dress girl in the
summer this again gave me like those
Greece vibes so I want to have like a
cute little white simple dress like this
and I like how it's very poofy feels
like a baby dress like a babydoll dress
okay this is gonna be a little hard to
explain on camera so okay first of all
it's a black bodysuit right and then a
crisscross is both in the front and in
the back wow this is such a nightmare to
explain I really like how it looks so
elegant like it Criss crosses in the
back and then just like sits on your
collarbones
and it's like the soft material very
very cute it looks really high-end like
looks designer or some and it was
only 20 bucks next up I got this a
little white shirt and it's very cute
very little very cropped and then it has
like the one sleeve thing going on I can
wear shirts like this when I was like 9
yeah it's cute this is a very simple
thing that you can throw on make it look
cute with jewelry I got this denim
jacket and one of the best investments I
made because I've already weren't like
seven times and I got it last week it's
just a light blue denim washed cropped
jacket I like having jackets that are
cropped just because sometimes I want to
like show off my pants and I don't want
to look super bulky so yeah a very very
good investment definitely recommend
next up I have this very girly dress
here it's this like chiffon material
again I really like the vibe what I like
to do is wear really girly dresses like
this and then wear them with like combat
boots so it's like maybe like sharp
contrast and definitely a look this is
kind of big on me so I'm gonna have to
get a tailored around the waist just so
it fits me a little better but it was
$50 which is I feel like a good price
for a dress like this that I know I'm
gonna get a lot of use out of the next
two things are kind of similar just kind
of like in different colors I guess so I
got this very flowy white tank and then
in the bottom it has like this lace trim
I think it's so cute like white chiffon
with denim is so cute so I want to have
a girly piece like this and then I got
that and kind of like a black and then
this time the lace trim is in the
neckline so it looks kind of similar
this has a deeper cut in the back just
very high that was the end of the video
