um my bracelet right now is actually
from there these jellybeans are really
good gonna be giving them away to you
guys so all you have to do to enter is
if you like sunny and as you can see I'm
surrounded by literally a bajillion
packages because today I'm gonna be
filming an unboxing haul I've literally
I mean I've never been so excited for a
video I feel like it's Christmas
I've been collecting like PR packages
stuff I bought online and like not
opening anything and literally have been
storing them in a corner in my room and
finally I thought it was time to open up
all of them and show you guys and some
of these things I literally ordered
forever ago and I've just been keeping
them in my room it's been literal
torture but today I'm gonna be
unpackaging everything and you guys are
gonna be seeing everything with me some
things I got so long ago that I
literally forgot what I got so this is
literally gonna be a first impressions
surprise haul video without further ado
let's jump into this video because I
feel like all these packages are gonna
fall on my head this little package is
from pretty little thing I believe I
actually purchased this one I forgot
what I got oh now I kind of remember
what I got the first thing I got was
this little black dress and these are
always necessary when you're going out I
feel like it's like the simplest going
out outfit and I used to have like my
go-to little black dress and then I
think I gave it to a friend because she
really needed one and never got it back
this was very affordable I just got one
of these and pretty little thing fits my
body very well this is in a size zero
weight what I got the same thing this
one is very similar but I feel like it
has like different detailing right here
I didn't think these two would be so
similar online okay well this is
slightly shorter so if I'm in one of
those moods okay let's move on
ooh this is cute I think they actually
sent this to me so this is a little
dainty little necklace from Bond star it
has the cutest little rose on it I've
been wearing so much more jewelry
recently and speaking of jewelry I got
this little package from Adina's jewels
which is my absolute favorite jewelry
company they always got my back my
bracelet right
was actually from there and so is my
ring they're just like the cutest jewel
chains so is my last name necklace that
I haven't taken off in like a good two
years or something I always get
questions about this necklace so they
actually send me this ring and this
bracelet in this package I kind of
already opened it but they also sent me
this little necklace with like Arabic
writing on it it looks like a vintage
coin which I thought was adorable and
then they also sent me this jeweled ring
which I also think is super cute the
thing I love about their jewelry is that
it's like really high quality so when
you shower it does rust it doesn't like
go black or anything go give them some
love and if you buy something I promise
you you will not be disappointed where
do we begin
okay this is a package from Nasty Gal
they've been having some crazy-ass sales
on Nasty Gal
literally up to 80% off I think they're
going out of business or something but
this is another dress it's like a white
dress and it's a midi dress so it goes
like above your ankles ish this dress
looks kind of big hmm anything would be
this big I don't remember buying this
either I feel like it looked different
online we'll see how this goes I'll let
you know if not check out my D pop a lot
of is on it
this one's from misguided I'm excited
basically I go to a lot of events and
this month I have a bunch coming up and
I'm sick of wearing like the same thing
over and over again so I just felt like
I needed to have like a few staple
dresses that I can wear to events and
stuff this one's kind of over the top
but it's basically like this fuchsia
like very vibrant pink
it's a blazer dress so it looks like a
blazer but you can actually wear it as a
dress this looks so cute because it
comes with this belt so online she like
wrapped it around her waist this is
gonna look so cute you're Paul gonna see
me going to an event in this on my
Instagram or something and this one this
one's a little bit fancier oh my god
I've always wanted one of these dresses
they're like a little tassel dresses oh
my god this with a tan and like heels is
gonna look so good
imagine the boomerangs I can take in
this like this so cute this is such a
party dress I
obsessed with it wait okay moving on to
the world boxes um I have one from Pixie

me oh this looks fancy oh my god wait

it literally says Haley's how adorable
so this is their glow tonic
so it's an exfoliating toner it came
with this little pump I'm excited to try
this what do we have here
this is from a brand called deci amp but
they sent me products from a brand
called the ordinary these look really
crazy okay this is the no-brainer set
I'm gonna come up their products are so
aesthetically pleasing basically they
sent me a bunch of skincare products so
this set comes with this is a
moisturizer and then this is a serum and
I believe this is like for acne or like
pimples or something and then it came
with these two they all come in this
like droplet packaging how cute is that

from origins which is another skincare
brand I obsess over skincare products

Ice Baby okay they put the product in a
bag of jellybeans a bag of pink jelly
beans are you kidding me yes this is a
makeup remover jelly these jellies have
been so popular to like remove makeup I
have a bunch and this one came in like a
bag of little crystals
this is a cooling primer which i think
is such a cool concept
I love cooling products because I feel
like they make my skin feel so hydrated
and like since there's a primer it's
like the perfect thing to put on before
makeup
from sky organics which is like a bubble
bath company they've sent me products
before the only thing is I don't have a
bathtub I mean like my mom does but I'm
not a big fan of bubble bath so I'm
