shut up I'm gonna give this one away hey
guys it's hailey here and today I'm
gonna be filming my a monthly PR
packaging unboxing haul video that was a
mouthful if you've never watched these
companies usually like send me products
to try out and I'm just gonna be
unboxing all these goodies some of these
are things I actually produce myself so
like things I ordered online you guys
seem to be liking these video so I'm
just going to keep them coming because
they're literally my favorite videos to
film I get so excited every time if you
think you're gonna like this video make
sure you subscribe because I upload
these almost once a month and they're
always a fun time and I don't want you
to miss out on that the last few I made
actually had some giveaways so let's see
if there's anything in this for you guys
so I'm just gonna hop right in and I
think I'm gonna start off with this
package this is from forever 21 and I
actually ordered all this stuff myself
so I ordered it online and I got it a
few days ago Oh Jack's no not for you
you're gonna have to leave this video
because you're being a little too safe
I'm going to Europe this summer and I
want all my outfits literally every
single day to be fly so I've just been
going ham with like really cute summery
clothes the first thing I got was this
little cute blouse and it's just white
very soft and it has these little tiny
mini red hearts all across it's a really
cute collared shirt I really like it and
it's really light so I feel like it's
gonna be good for the summer because it
gets freakin hot over there this looks
really cute too it's a tie in the front
sure bralette whatever it is in this
like cute little mango color and I
really like it because it actually has
like cuffing inside so you don't have to
worry about like look bra I wear what
days and it's not flimsy it has like a
zipper in the back I think it would look
super cute with like high-waisted shorts
or a long skirt or something so that's
really cute I like it this is a midi
dress so it's this black checkered one
with again a tie up I guess these like
tie up things
popular nowadays there's a mini little
peekaboo hole right here it's over all
tight around your body and it stops like
right on your shins
I hope this looks good I got this basic
white shirt it was like six bucks I just
wanted a very like soft white shirt
which is exactly what I got I got this
next thing I was kind of nervous about
cuz it's so unlike what I usually wear
is this white lace sheer button-up it
has some frills right here and then it
comes with this black tie so you like
tie it around your neck and you make it
into a cute little bow I'll insert a
picture of like what it looks like
online and what it's gonna look like
when I wear it I thought be cute for
like something a little bit more formal
with like a mini black skirt that
survived I was going forward with this
furthermore oh so cute I got yet another
tie in the front shirt this is like red
with polka dots and then I kind of plan
on wearing this like over bathing suits
and stuff I tie it a little bit more
closer so it's not like my whole chest
is out there it's super cute I really
I'm digging like the whole like Polka
Dot vibes I think it's very like spring
and girly and like cute
you know next up I got this very like
simple again summer ask white top it's
kind of like cropped and then it frills
out in the bottom how's these cute
little buttons going down I just wanted
a lot of like simple pieces that I could
literally style with anything and it
would look cute this is so cute I am
literally obsessed with it no those
shirts that were really popular for a
while a banjo with off-the-shoulder
sleeves okay well basically this is that
so it's gonna look like a banjo but look
at this sleeves like they are flowy they
are huge they're like balloon sleeves
sure it smells really weird and it's
like satin it's so soft
looks great quality oh my god this girl
looks so cute I can't wait to style this
forever 21 what the I got these earrings
but they literally broke as I took them
out of the packaging you being for real
dawg they were supposed to look like
these cuz I'm
jewelry especially like gold jewelry
after we return this Oh such a process
forever 21 I'm kind of pissed I mean
everything else was cute but like why
you gotta do me like that with the
jewelry the next package is from revolve
and I'm obsessive furball it's literally
my favorite store it's kind of high-end
I just wanna like dive in because I got
some really cute things so the first
thing I got were these pair of jeans you
can tell they're really good quality
they are a little bit more on the
expensive side but they're bright the
brand girlfriend denim all the models
that you see on like Instagram and stuff
like they all wear this brand because
their jeans just make your body look
really nice these are kind of
high-waisted so they button up and then
they kind of wrap around your waist and
they're kind of like loose in the bottom
so they're kind of like boyfriend jeans
at the end right here the front is
shorter than the back so I got these
jeans I got this off the shoulder like
peasant top it's super sheer it has tiny
speckles of glitter I don't know if you
can see it clearly but it's just this
like nude off the shoulder top you can
definitely dress this up or down and I
think this is by Chrissy Teigen and then
finally I got this tweet skirt it's kind
of high-waisted and mini that also
sparkles I really like it it's like the
perfect mixture of girly and classy this
is what the pattern looks close-up so
that's all I got from revolve I love
them thank you guys so much
I'm obsessed by the way everything
that's in this video will be linked down
below so make sure you check out the
description box if you see anything you
like let's hop into the Sephora bag I
actually got these today at the actual
stores so this is like
online or anything like that I got two
hair products this is the wavy been
conditioner I think in my last unboxing
video I hauled the mini travel sized
version of this because I said I want to
try it out and I did and literally wait
haircare works so well with my hair I
feel like it's never looked this healthy
it makes many are super soft
I actually ended up using all of that up
so I went ahead and bought the full size
today and then this is the dry bar
detox dry conditioner I got a blow out
there yesterday and then after they did
my hair they sprayed the ends and I was
curious as to what it was and basically
the dry conditioner just so it's like
soft not tangle II and looks smooth and
shiny these are some Sony's from monarch

basically send me a bunch of these
really really dope sunglasses this one
looks like this and then I got this one
which kind of reminds me of like the
off-white glasses I really like these
and then finally I got these like cat
eye tortoise shell pattern ones I also
think these are really cool they
actually provided me with a discount
code so if you go on their website you
use the code Haley 30 you'll get 30% off
any pair of sunglasses and their
sunglasses are really affordable to
begin with so you're getting such a good
deal so I think it's definitely worth it

any outfit so thank you a monarch Tokyo
