orange I have no frickin clue so today
I'm going to be showing you guys two
healthy back to school lunch ideas I
don't think of it as only two recipes
there's that please taste recipes in
here because there's going to be three
dishes in each lunch um if you want to
find out what I mean then keep on
watching so I'm going to be starting off
with lunch idea number one and the main
dish for this will be a potato salad
real original name guys am i right so I
just turn on my stove and fill this pot
up with some hot water and then I put my
potatoes in and also my eggs but if you
want this meal to be vegan you can
obviously take the eggs out I just put
them in for a kick in protein and then I
just fill it up a little bit more and
just put the lid on so we could boil it
and then I got some fresh parsley for my
vegetable basket and chop these up into
really tiny pieces while my potatoes are
still cooking I decide to make the
dressing so I just got some lemon and
juice it up this machine is really cool
I'm not going to lie it also gives you a
hand massage at the same time and then I
put the lemon juice in a little bit of
olive oil some red peppers because I
like knit with a little spicy some
pepper and a little bit of salt pretty
much any seasoning that you'd like and
then I mix it all up and it had already
been 15 minutes so my eggs and my
potatoes were all cooked up I decide to
take them out and put them aside so they
could cool off because I cannot peel
them or else I'd burn my hands and once
they were all cooled off I just cut the
potatoes into little cubes
and lastly I cut my eggs also to accuse
who is so far the choice once I was all
done chopping I put my potatoes and the
parsley in this bowl and I also put my
dressing in there and decide to mix it
all up I didn't put my eggs in because
if I mixed up with anything was probably
end up getting all mushy and I didn't
want that so I just put them on top and
really gently decide to mix them up and
what oh that was my finished potato
salad moving on to the side dish this is
a traditional and Greek food and it's
called tzatziki I have so much of this
when I was in Greece so I just peeled
all this cucumber and then I started
grating it oh my he is expecting tragedy
aggression jam when I was done I put all
the cucumbers into this plastic bowl and
I put in some yogurt I actually didn't
have Greek yogurt but if I did this
would have tasted ten times better so I
recommend you use that and then I
sprinkled on some mint because this
makes it taste 100 times better and I
mix it all up and usually does if he
doesn't have chickpeas but I thought
it'd be a nice kick of poaching in there
and then for my vegetable basket I got
some fresh mint leaves and put it on so
you can look cute and also take
and you're finished how simple was that
guys so you know when you're dozing off
in class and you just need something so
you can wake up this dessert is perfect
for that
just get a banana and peel it and then
chop a banana into little tiny circles
once I was done I put all the bananas
into this container and then I put in
some walnuts because bananas are one
let's go great together also walnuts
have really good fats in them and then I
drizzled some honey on top and some
cinnamon because cinnamon is a
metabolism booster but if you don't want
to end up being too sweet you can skip
the honey and you're done be honest I
feel like this lunch is pretty gourmet
it's definitely not something that you
would see every day in the cafeteria
moving on to lunch idea number two which
is actually my personal favorite um
we're gonna be starting off with and
making these delicious and veggie
burgers so I reached over to my
handy-dandy vegetable basket and I got
some zucchini some spring onions you can
use any vegetables that you'd like I
using parsley and I put on my greens in
this water bowl and all the dirt sinks
to the bottom is a great way of cleaning
out your vegetables and then I drain
them in the strainer and I got my spring
onions and you have to chop everything
into the tiniest pieces like
and then I graded my other vegetables
squares I put all vegetables into this
big bowl after I was done with the
vegetables I graded the cheese and the
cheese is going to melt therefore it
will act as a glue and keep everything
together and then I crack three eggs in
here to boost the taste I put in some
salt some red peppers black peppers and
I just mix everything together and the
next step is cooking them and I know
frying them isn't the healthiest option
but I thought be really quick if you
have a lot more time in your hands I
definitely recommend baking them in the
oven and now I started making my patty
and while I was doing this I felt like
spongebob but yeah I put in lettuce
tomatoes pickles if you want you can add
in a little bit of ketchup and I was
done with the krabby patty and I was so
proud of it to be honest I thought it
looked like something you would actually
get another restaurant the side dish for
this is so ridiculously easy I thought I
try to do something that was like fries
and so like 600,000 times - healthier
get it like hamburger fries anyways I
cut my carrots I'm making numbers into
thin and long steaks and then I squeezed
off some lemon because I think it tastes
so much better like that and yeah I was
basically it definitely satisfies that
like crunchy craving that you get the
use in a while
and since the main dish was kind of big
I thought I just do a simple dessert so
I got this cranberry granola bar it
gives you energy and it has a lot of
fiber in it so yeah so these are all my
lunch ideas for you today if you enjoyed
this video make sure you give it a big
thumbs up and really appreciate it if
