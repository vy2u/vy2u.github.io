phenomena because I feel ease since then
I think the most important thought far
the most important part in Joseph's El
Ninos looks and the whole doubt of it
hey guys it's healing sunny and safe I'm
gonna be filming a Q&amp;amp;A I asked you guys
a few questions on my Instagram which if
you don't follow me on there you
definitely should I received a bunch of
questions all about how safe it my
exercise routine my diet modeling my
relationship and a bunch of other random
things so I picked them out that I
thought would be the best to answer and
that's going to be doing today and also
munching on some frozen raspberries
because they're my favorite thing ever
so questions you guys asked me a lot is
how do you keep yourself motivated to
maintain a healthy lifestyle I know
something we all struggle with is being
too lazy to actually get up and work out
and put effort into like eating good
foods I personally think the most
important part is actually starting once
you start you get familiar with the
feeling that you know being fit and
healthy it gives you and that feeling is
like a drug where you always want it so
I guess that feeling of like no after
workout or eating a good meal doc
feeling is definitely something I always
crave so therefore I do stuff that won't
mean achieve that what is your dream car
I was actually talking of the CSU days
I'd always wanted to Ranger report and
there's a couple of Range Rover sports
in LA that I've been like seen driving
around and I know the same one because
they have the same license plate every
time you see it but it's like army green
and it's matte and out and it's
beautiful and how black rims is
absolutely gorgeous you know once I get
the coins in my eye mine is wet
how do you deal with fake people in
Behrami
it's actually funny because I dealt with
a lot of that when I was little like
middle school and like math grade I
would be like Fighting's my friends like
hobbies like lakes were really my
darling did you hear what she said about
me I could go up and realize it like
actually doesn't matter at all you're
just we like making the best out of your
life and being happy and anyone that
tries to like bring you down or like put
even about notice you do not even like
work like fighting about so when you see
a fake person you can kind of help so I
stay away from that so when you stay
away from baby people withdrawn on kind
of leaves on its own because Thomas
creates by fate people who want
attention because they're fake and have
you thought of making a clothing line
good thing you asked because it's coming
so cool like why soon I mean probably
like a week or two I don't think it's
that the website is completely ready I
have all the features I want to post on
it I have my relief trailer coming out
really soon the only thing I'm waiting
on right now is the products actually
being shipped here overseas by took
a little longer than expected but
they'll probably arrive in like a week
and I'm so excited they're gonna be
super quality super affordable nothing
like crazy expensive and I know you guys
gonna really like it actually you're a
restaurant in LA I favor Russia in
general like in the whole entire world
it's sugar fish I have an expression
like an actual obsession I'm not kidding
last week I have tuna fish four times
out of the seven hands of the week and
it's fish it's rocket I'm not supposed
to be doing that but I'm just so
obsessed like it's all I think about is
all I ever crave every time I come to
like oh one where should we go eat on my
sugar fish and they're like no stop
we've already had it like two times as
you this week I'm just a motivator to go
to the gym all the time just kind of
relate to the first question I answered
but going to the gym is like a
completely different deal so for the
past for a month or two I've been
working out with friends and it's so
much more easier and fun when you go
with a friend even though working out
still kind of like sucks because sweat
and like but at least when you go with a
friend you have I want to share the pain
way we like motivate each other
definitely find a good money and hit
that gym up because it's so much more
easier and so much more fun that's me
asked you I'm modeling if you wanted to
come any model I'm never really
considered professional modeling one
because I
now I would like to short social media
Molly's actually something more than
traditional modeling now it's crazy to
think of I mean I guess there's still a
good balance but so tuning along is
definitely taking this poll and I never
really like thought about it and I'm
still don't really consider pursuing it
like full-time in my future but I
modeled with Nike last week and I
modeled for a couple different brands
recently and it's so much fun the
faculty the whole team working together
to get that one shot to you know spread
the message that they want to create a
creative image that they want to share
with the world is just so fun and
fulfilling and I'm gonna be seeing a
couple models agencies really soon so I
don't know I don't know where that to
take me I definitely think it would be
really fun and I want to try it out so I
guess we'll see and I'll share my
experiences you guys along the way how
do you deal with a busboy thank God I
don't have to do that and thinking back
I never really ever dealt with Busboys
because I know my word so I'm not going
to waste my time for dealing with
childish little boys you know what is
your favorite fat burning exercise so
fat burning is usually cardio and for
cardio what I usually do is dear master
I don't know what it is is basically
going upstairs
but going nowhere it's just there's that
circulate it kills you it's cardio
because it gets their heart pumping and
you're sweating but at the same time
it's muscle training because you're
actually using your glutes in my feared
quad to push yourself up so I like that
balance I want to feel like I need to
lose weight I just know that you need
cardio in order to get results so that
basically many reason I do it are you a
tomato yes finally what is your favorite
healthy breakfast meals currently I've
been making smoothies a lot like a lot a
lot like a lot like every day goes
school and their teachers I hope was
just with these dragon looking a fool
battery actually some French processes
like banana and fit and she's like yeah
yeah how do you act so confident a lot
of people are like I'm so jealous of
your confidence you're so confident and
actually
sometimes we're watching people on
YouTube or scrolling through someone's
Instagram we forget that everyone on
social media has portrayed the best
versions of themselves so they portray
what do they want other people to see so
when you're going through the Instagram
you forget that that's not what their
life looks like all the times they only
want to share the parts of their life
thought was perfect in order to create
that image and I'm not going to lie I do
that - I wouldn't post an ugly picture
of myself for like a picture of myself
where I study exploded or something
because I wouldn't want to and like I'm
really guilty of doing that it's not
just me I know there's so many other
people that do even like super pins
people that are like truly gorgeous they
still post like the best notices
themselves so I might come off as like
super I was going and confident don't
care about what people think and I come
on be ever and give you guys advice but
there are obviously times where I'm
self-conscious and I don't like a
certain thing about myself and it makes
me always think about it makes me worry
and I'm just really lucky to realize
that sometimes it's really not worth
caring and I've improved on that idea
just don't rate a compare game because
I've gained can get really stressful and
you're always an end up losing a
copyright blow up the summer for
back-to-school girl I feel like every
summer I blow up a little more but like
don't get me wrong me I'm not some stun
coffee it just I was like in the very
dark so now at least I'm in like the
shape you know I feel like the Sun just
helps just be in the Sun the Sun makes
everyone prettier I mean I am like just
like being tan like Bundy getting your
hair shiny very nice can you explain
what you eat aka your diet I usually
start off my day very healthy so I'll
have like smoothie with a bunch of
fruits and veggies at school I have like
a protein bar like a granola bar so so
much still healthy I'll come back home
most likely get sushi because I have a
problem so I have some one healthy diet
but in the weekend
I don't really restrict myself I have a
sprinkled cupcake every now and then and
I'll have ice cream every now
and I gotta lose weight so I feel like
if I just work out and eat someone
healthy it kind of works that for me
what is your next trip and so need to
get worried
don't get worried I usually travel a lot
more in the summer but this time I'm
going to be in Europe again definitely
