going to be doing somewhat of a
different kind of video than what I
usually film and sorry for no video in a
long time I was just kind of you know
getting used to the whole flow of school
and stuff like that and this video was
kind of gonna be really intense because
I'm going to be talking about a
sensitive kind of topic and you might
agree with a lot of things that I say
you might disagree with a lot of things
that I'm going to say it's just my
honest opinion and my opinion is kind of
different than a lot of people's
opinions I kind of disagree with a lot
of them and if you're one of those
people don't be afraid to comment down
below and tell me the things that you
think is wrong about what I'm saying
but yeah since I've got all that covered
let's get on with the video so I'm going
to set this way level and show you a
little pictures so I want you to look at
this picture right here and tell me if
you think she's pretty just the first
thing that comes up in your brain yes or
no do you think she's pretty
now let's push it away um now I want you
to ask yourself would you want to trade
faces with her just be honest comment
down below we'll kind of keep this video
as if we were you know having
conversations so don't mind us bringing
back my question now I want you to ask
yourself do you think physical
appearance is important just do do you
think this face and this Zeke is
important and I feel like a lot of you
said no physical appearance is not
important then how come a lot of you
thought that girl I showed in the
picture wasn't pretty I mean what it is
pretty you know just think about that as
well what what does beautiful and pretty
mean when you look in the mirror do you
think you're pretty how many of you look
in the mirror and then think to yourself
damn I look good and if your answer to
that question was I do that I do that
once at the time I think I look good
keep doing what you're doing you don't
even have to watch this video you can
exit out if you want don't waste your
time on me but I also feel like
at least 85% of you said no that doesn't
happen quite a lot I don't look in the
mirror and be like I look good
that's not how society works nowadays
because society has created an image of
pretty in our eyes and pretty is long
hair pretty is blue eyes pretty is this
toned flat stomach pretty is a flawless
face don't lie but how many have you
typed in like pretty girl ennui hearted
and been like damn I wish I look like
her because I'm not gonna lie I've done
that guilty but I have and unfortunately
you know you know what's funny you and I
yeah we were the ones that made it that
way we're the ones that chew this thick
big line between ugly and beautiful
we're the ones that even created those
two words that's how we define that word
and it's not fair to blame it on anybody
else you're the one that thinks you're
not pretty and in society we have like
these lines and if you're in those lines
then good keep doing what you're doing
you're pretty but just step out of it
just a little bit you don't belong here
sorry
you're ugly ya know and that is
disgusting that's revolting that just
makes me hate people and you know what
it's time to put an end to that because
I'm so sick of not feeling happy with
myself and I'm so sick of other girls
going around thinking I'm ugly I'm fat I
was so sick of it and it makes me really
sad to see that happening every single
day how many times have you gone to a
pizza restaurant and at least one of
your friends are like oh my god I'm so
fat I can't I can't take this anymore I
look in the mirror and I see the things
that are wrong with me I see
crooked big nose I see my weird chin
like about to attack people I see my
frizzy hair and I see my big fat belly
that a lot of people don't think I have
because I have you know skinny arms but
guess what I do have a big fat belly
right under this shirt that you can't
see so haha I got you there but I'm so
sick of looking in the mirror and
thinking about all the things that I
could be I wish I had if we lived in a
world where everybody looked the same
and it was all an even field then people
would actually look at the mirror to see
what's worth seeing we all blame it on
someone we were angry and we're like why
did I have to be like this and stop
blaming others for yourself stop lying
to yourself and saying I'm beautiful
just the way I am and stop lying to
others because you know what beautiful
is beautiful is being happy beautiful is
looking in the mirror and actually
liking what you're saying so if you
don't like what you see then get up and
do something about it I'm not saying go
get a nose job or anything stupid like
that but jeezum means to improve the
kind of person that you are don't just
sit around and be like you know what
that girl the other day yeah she told me
I was beautiful just the way I am yeah
I'll just listen to her yeah you know
what I'm beautiful just the way I am
that's fine but if you're gonna look in
the mirror and not like what you see
anyways even though that one girl said
you're perfect um hello get up and do
something about it
and I want to look in the mirror and be
like damn Haley you look good today and
you tell me to put some food in my mouth
ain't gonna change that so stop a look
in the mirror and see things that you do
have nowadays when you call yourself
pretty or when you say yeah I'm hot and
that's that's kind of like being
big-headed and loving yourself you know
what if you have the guts to call
yourself pretty then you have the guts
to do anything you go girl
be confident and being confident is it a
bad thing stop telling people that there
for just the way that they are if you
wouldn't love yourself if you wanted
their shoes if somebody says oh my god
I'm so fat don't be like you're perfect
just the way you are and tell them that
if they think they're fat and they don't
like that then they should do something
about it and that is going to help that
person way more than telling them
they're perfect just the way that they
are and yeah nobody's perfect you also
gotta accept that fast and you know all
those beauty goods that tell you you're
beautiful just the way you are but they
go ahead and post a million makeup
tutorials and call them enhancing your
natural beauty all of that in my opinion
is bull poop you know I do my makeup and
get dressed pretty and I do all this for
myself I'm not doing it to impress other
people that is also a ghoul poop because
why would you do all that when you're on
home alone like I have never met someone
that has just put on a lot of makeup
dressed up real nice and just sat at
home all day like how come you don't do
that when you're not going out aren't
you like trying to impress yourself what
happened to that theory of yours don't
listen to all of that crap do something
that's gonna make you happy and do
something that you're gonna wake up next
day and be proud of yourself I have
locked on for a really long time but I
also want to get to the conclusion yes
physical appearance is important in this
world that we live in today it's
important and to be honest it's a big
part of our lives
it's important but it's not the most
important thing sayings like grades
grades are important but it's not the
most important thing one day your
biggest problem could be which college
you're going to go into or if that if
that person in class thinks you're
pretty that day you and then
next morning you could wake up and your
whole family could not feel why and
those problems that you have the day
before are going to look so silly next
to the ones that you have today let's
live today like there is no tomorrow
asked you said we're going to die yes
anyways I think I have to put an end to
this cheesy we'll see the reaction I get
from you guys but thanks for watching
this video guys
I hope I could help even one person that
would be that would be nice and I love
you all to potato back bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
