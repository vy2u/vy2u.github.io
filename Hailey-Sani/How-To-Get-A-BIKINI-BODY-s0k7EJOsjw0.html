guys the failure and today I'm going to
be filming a how to get a bikini body
video and I've been wanting to film this
because I know summer is coming up and a
lot of people are insecure about their
body and they're like really stressed
out because you're going to go to the
pool and if you don't like your body
then it's going to be much harder so I'm
here for your rescue but before I get
started I just wanted to point out that
there's no such thing as the perfect
bikini body because the perfect bikini
body is the body that you feel happy in
so if you feel happy in your curves and
your rocking that look go ahead girl
that's your perfect bikini body but if
you're not happy with your body then I'm
gonna try to help you in ways so you can
be happy and by the end of this video I
promise you you're going to find out
some things that are going to help you
incredibly and you're going to be like
so thankful to me it's okay guys because
a lot of these things I didn't know
until a couple months ago and they've
helped me incredibly so I'm here for
your help
let's get started number one before you
control what you're eating you have to
learn how to control what your gonna do
with the stuff the cheeky so you have to
know how your body is gonna I guess
react to things that you put in your
mouth and to and then swallow or eat
also say
and one thing that comes with that is
their digestive system now if your
metabolism isn't fast then I guess
there's nothing you can do about that
because everybody is different but there
are some tips into getting a fast
metabolism and if you get a fast
metabolism then you'll burn more
calories and then get thinner now there
are some things that will help you
digest the food that you eat even better
these things are green tea and I've been
drinking green tea every morning and
night so two causes of green tea every
day and I've been doing this for like
the past month and I've helped and it
has helped me so much it tastes good it
helps your body because the toxins that
it spreads out in your body helps you
digest your food properly and digesting
your food is really important because if
you just eat the food and then we don't
digest it then you will have like a big
fat belly and nobody wants that well I
don't think anybody wants a if you want
that that's cool that's cool and
cinnamon also helps with digesting your
food that's why I like to put in a pinch
of cinnamon in my green tea and it
tastes
another thing is not eat a big meal
before you sleep because to digest the
food your body needs to be active so if
you're just like not moving and sleeping
and your body's in like in any action
then how it are you going to be able to
digest the food that you just ate but
what I like to do is just eat two
spoonfuls of yogurt half an hour before
I sleep because yogurt also helps your
digestive system and there are some
foods that burn calories and they
contain and some of those foods are
grapefruit avocados celery good spicy
foods burn calories like crazy so if
you're Indian then drink two liters of
water every day kids now here's the
thing that's so important and I'm bet
you don't know it I didn't know it now I
know it it's helped me a lot and I
really want to share it with you guys
I'm a kind of thin person but I do have
some belly fat and I know that's gross
and everything but it's the truth it's
the sad truth I do have some belly fat
and I'm working really hard to get
getting rid of it but until like a month
ago I thought doing sit-ups and crunches
and planks would help me like burn all
the fat in my stomach and then I would
get like a flat stomach with abs and
here's the fifth tip for you if you have
belly fat and you want to get perfect
abs here's no tip don't do ab workouts
you heard me
don't do outwards and you're probably
thinking Kaylee are you stupid if you
want abs we're supposed to do ab
workouts
now that's partially true it is true but
not if you have belly fat now your body
needs to store some fat somewhere and
think of your belly as like a storage
area for your body and it's the biggest
storage area and it has some empty space
though it's like oh how about I store
the fat down there
thanks body that really helps me a lot
it does help you but it still sucks and
everybody even if you have a six-pack
you have a thin layer of that on your
belly now after that you have your abs
and if you're doing sit-ups and crunches
and all these exercises your abs are
probably getting really strong and
really big and that's good but what it
does is just your abs get bigger so it
keeps pushing the little fat in front of
it and then you start looking like
you've got a belly and you're like what
I'm doing a hundred crunches why do I
still have this belly
well that's because the ABS underneath
the fat
is just pushing the fad forward so it's
making you look like you have a big
first you got to get rid of that fat on
top of it now there's no such thing as
burning only the fat in your stomach
there's no such thing it's either a take
it all or take nothing deal
so to burn the fat you got to like burn
the fat all over your body and it's
pretty simple to do that you just do
cardio and if you don't know what cardio
is cardio is basically when you're
moving a lot and you're sweating and
you're burning all those extra calories
you don't need and you can do that by
going on the treadmill or if you do have
like a big park which I don't next year
house you can go running or jogging
there once you burn that fat you can
start doing your ab exercises so you can
get that beautiful tone flat stomach
that you play on Monday Wednesday and
Friday I like to go to the gym and I
like to go on the treadmill for around
40 minutes and I burn 200 calories on
there running most of the time I could
have switched out between walking and
running throughout those 40 minutes and
then get off the treadmill and I'll go
on the bike and I'll go on the bike for
around 10 minutes and it'll help me burn
50 calories and that's really good for
10 minutes and then I like to come home
and do 50 squats on Tuesdays and
Thursdays I like to go on pump up and
I'm not sponsored by pump up or anything
I'm just telling my personal opinion I
think pump up is literally the best
thing that has ever happened to me you
get so much inspiration and you learn so
many things from pump up because you do
have like your little personal trainer
guy and pump puff is an app on your
phone and it has thousands of workouts
on there that you can pick for although
that's pretty much all the weekdays and
on Saturday if I'm not doing anything I
go swimming on Sundays I really don't do
anything because your body does need to
rest another thing that has helped me a
lot is setting short-term goals for
myself and I've set a goal for myself on
the 7th of June and that was not to eat
any junk food until the 7th of July so
that's like a month and I
and I've been doing really good it's
only been three days but I am allowed to
give myself a little treat now and then
like take a bite out of a brownie or eat
one cookie but I'm not allowed to like
get a bag of chips put it on my bed and
then eat it while I'm watching Pretty
Little Liars no you can't do that Haley
that's bad it's also really important to
get a good night's sleep and you're
supposed to get at least eight hours of
sleep every day for all these people
going on tumblr who I am I don't do that
anymore
thank goodness yeah I want to burn 500
calories while I'm sleeping and not
doing anything and somebody get me
Maleficent now before I finish the video
I actually put together a healthy
breakfast idea for you guys it's really
easy to make you only need three
ingredients which I probably think you
already have at home and it's healthy
and it tastes good yeah that's all I got
for this recipe are going to be needing
a banana two eggs 1/3 cup of oats and
mine are powdered but it doesn't have to
be and optionally some fruits so I have
cherries strawberries and peaches my
first step is going to be mixing all the
ingredients in a blender so I'm going to
be starting off by peeling my banana and
then I'm going to be breaking it into
little pieces and then putting it into
the blender next I'm going to be
cracking my two eggs right on top of
them finally I'm going to be putting my
oats in and then you could just start
blending all your ingredients together
for two to three minutes I'm going to be
putting in a little bit of olive oil
onto my pan and then spreading it evenly
around next I'm going to be getting my
thick mixture and then putting it on my
pan and then waiting it to cook and then
I'm going to be flipping it to the other
side and then cooking it that way and
then you're done next I decided to cut
my fruit into little tiny pieces that
way it's easier to eat them because you
know
and you are literally done that was like
so easy and it's delicious and I made
like five and ate all of them so yeah
and I made some green tea to go with my
breakfast and put in a pinch of cinnamon
and you're done so enjoy enjoy it guys
good breakfast thanks for watching this
video guys I hope I could help you in
any sort of way and if you do do do do
I'm five years old you do try any of
these things that I just talked about
make sure you send me a picture of your
bikini body that you feel also confident
in and I hope to see you next time I
love you all Takuto and back bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
