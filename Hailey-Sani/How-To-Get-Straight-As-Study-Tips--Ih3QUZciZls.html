today I'm here with a video that's going
to help you get better grades in the
upcoming school year so without further
ado let's get started before I sat down
to film this I watched a bunch of videos
from YouTube to see if I could get
inspired to do some things they all
consisted of a girl sitting down in a
desk or on her bed highlighting
important things and making flashcards I
know that you know that everybody else
knows that so what's the point of making
a hundred videos about it so I thought
of some things that you might know but I
know a lot of people out there won't
know and they're really really really
good tips and they've helped me a lot in
the past I'm not an educator or anything
but I am a straight-a student ever since
the first grade
so I'm just gonna like share some of my
tips with you
something I love doing is writing the
sticky notes and putting it all over my
room so if there's something that you
need to memorize or something that you
need to remember it stick it around your
room where you tend to go a lot so when
you see it you'll be memorizing it and
you won't even know you're studying
while you're studying ain't that cool
now another thing I really like to do is
make little like secret codes and when I
do these I feel like those little secret
agents in Club Penguin remember those
you go around you know looking for like
bad murder cases on Club Penguin where
is this video going codes are really
useful if you're trying to memorize
something in the right order like if
it's on a timeline here are some
examples
okay okay eighteen fourteen eighteen is
the age I'm going to move to California
and fourteen is the age I'm now bingo
okay I need to memorize all of these by
tomorrow what if I made like a secret
code
that could work frogs bathe really
intensely you're not a snake I am
telling you that is the worst thing ever
if you have something do three months
after it was handed out to you do it in
that week cuz you'll do it and then you
won't have to think about that whole
thing from whole themas and you'll just
be on your little mini vacation while
everybody else is like oh my god I gotta
get stunt hey what's up nothing you know
just watching the Fosters
now I think I'll just do that tomorrow
thanks for telling me though by three
weeks nigga
hi
wait what that was due tomorrow uh oh
what is a Conant bond is this even
English see Google Images girl that
looks way too hard to draw anybody got
time for that
okay that'll do it sassy and obviously
super cool what is a convent
wait how do you spell Kabul in Kabul and
bond by Haley love you miss
is Cameron Haley again literally my
number one tip ever is to actually
listen to class I know tons of people
who go on their phones when the teachers
actually teaching stuff or like talk to
the person next to them I never talk to
the person next to me unless I get
what's going on in that class and if you
don't understand what the teacher saying
just raise your hand and tell her to
re-explain it and I promise you no one's
gonna make fun of you so many people
don't raise their hands up because they
were afraid that classmates are gonna
make fun of them like being like oh you
don't get this you're stupid but guess
what those people are going to be
relieved because they don't have the gut
to raise their own hands up so when
somebody else is raising their hand up
they're like good don't be ashamed
you're there to learn if you're not
learning then something is wrong
yes Haley I don't get the active voice
could you explain it raising your hand
up and asking question is it wrong
what's wrong is not understanding it and
not doing anything about it I feel like
those little motivational teachers
counselors that walk around the hallways
to like yeah I can do it if you have an
exam and you have some things that you
have to memorize before the exam the
night before the exam make sure like the
last things that you look at before you
go to bed are the things that you're
memorizing because it's scientifically
proven I actually researched about it
the things that you think of going to
bed you think of waking up or something
like that but anyway it gets in your
head more so when you're in the middle
of the exam you'll be like holla girl I
knew this because I was thinking about
it I won't have a sleep it you have a
really big exam don't watch a TV show or
read a book or watch a movie the night
before like I said whatever you do
before you go to bed it sticks in your
mind so if you're thinking about Theo
James while you're
doing your word you'll just fail that
exam because I mean algebra or Theo
James I mean you tell me thanks for
watching this video guys I hope I could
help you in any sort of way and I know
there weren't a lot of tips but these
tips will get you through the whole
school year so you're welcome love you
