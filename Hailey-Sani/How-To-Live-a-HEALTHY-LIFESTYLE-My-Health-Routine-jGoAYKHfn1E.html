gonna be sharing with you guys my health
care routine this is gonna like
literally include everything that's
related to health all the way from like
my hair care routine to my fitness to my
like vitamins and just like every single
thing I do to make sure I'm in my best
shape and just overall living a healthy
lifestyle if you're not already make
sure you subscribe and click the bell
right there to be notified every time I
upload which is every Saturday that
further ado let's jump straight into
this video so here are some of the
things that I usually keep in my gym bag
so I have a towel and then I have some
ankle weights for some of my workouts
workout clothes if I'm changing at the
gym and my head and shoulders shampoo
and conditioner for showering after my
workout a jump rope for warming up and
then sometimes I have hand tape if I'm
going boxing a must have is my
resistance band which I use for pretty
much every single workout headphones and
a hair tie and that's usually what I
keep in my gym bag my sister nila want
to join me on this workout so she
decided to come along with me and once
I'm at the gym I start my workout and my
workouts are almost never the same I
have a ton of workout videos on my
channel so if you want to see like what
I usually do I'll link them down below
so some of you might know but I live in
Los Angeles and sometimes the LA
lifestyle can get a little bit chaotic
because I go to real school and I do
YouTube and work and everything and
bouncing that is pretty hard but I think
a very important part of staying healthy
and shape and feeling good is working
out because you just feel so much
stronger and it adds so much confidence
to your life so I almost always try to
make a little bit of time every week to
work out and take care of my body as you
can see nose trying in the back I don't
know how it's exactly working out for
her but I mean it's effort that counts
depending on the workout I'm usually at
the gym for round an hour and then once
I'm done I grab my stuff and head out
even though working out makes your body
look incredible I think another
important factor is making sure you feel
good because you look good something
that I've always been secure about is my
hair because I'm Turkish if you guys
didn't know so I have Middle Eastern
roots and my hair likes to show it it's
very poofy very voluminous and thick and
I've always struggled with it so
recently I partnered up with Head &amp;amp;
Shoulders and started using their smooth
and silky shampoo and conditioner I
think it does an amazing job cleansing
my hair especially after the gym when
you have a lot of sweat and dirt built
up and I've noticed a lot less dandruff
because it protects my scalp from
flaking I really like the conditioner I
feel like this is the only conditioner
I've used that's really good at aiming
my frizzy hair I like to leave in my
hair for 3 to 5 minutes and once it's
all soaked in I rinse it out and my hair
feels so soft and moisturized I wrap
myself around in a towel and head out
skin care after the gym is so important
because you basically just sweat it out
all the gross things that were built up
under your skin so if you don't clean it
afterwards it's probably gonna end up as
acne when you're working out your skin
does lose some hydration so make sure
you rehydrate yourself using a
moisturizer or a face oil knowing the
background looks like some kind of scary
movie I swear touching to what I just
said two seconds ago make sure your
whole body's moisturize these are my
go-to 2 products it's like a duo set
from Kiehl's I believe it's the creme de
corpse collection and they make my skin
so soft it's a body oil and then a
lotion that follows
I have a mean protein smoothie game so
if you ever workout with me
you're welcome I'm kidding but I like to
add all my favorite frozen fruit so here
I have some berries and bananas
it's a protein smoothie so it needs some
protein obviously this is from Trader
Joe's it's just Meegan it's vanilla
flavored it's alright this is powered
just from the brand moondust and i think
it's like an herbal supplement it kind
of tastes bad but it's supposed to be
good for you so I was like whatever the
final ingredient is almond milk you can
do soy you can do oh you can do coconut
just try not to do caramel because
that's so bad for you like why would you
wanna drink that anyway and then finally
I blend everything up once my smoothie
is the perfect color and texture I pour
all of it into this mason jar and rip it
up for the next couple hours I make sure
you drink a lot of water because I did
lose a lot so I want to maintain my
water levels vitamins are really
important for me because sometimes I do
lack them so these make up for them so I
don't get sick very often I like to take
vitamin E which is good for your skin
and your hair and then b12 because I am
a vegetarian so b12 is something that I
need to make up for my favorite vitamins
are like the daily gummies cuz they
taste really good and they're also
really good for you and I think that
sums up every single step in my health
routine I hope you guys enjoy this video
I try to do something different so let
me know if you liked it and yeah I love
you guys so much all the ways to Pluto
and back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
