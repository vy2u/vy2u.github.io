to be showing you how you can naturally
get blonde highlights or a beautiful
ombre so let's get started the first
option is find hair lightening products
from the drugstore like this one
products that have tanning oil
tend to be more effective and chamomile
is a type of Daisy also products that
are high light activating will make the
blonde streaks in your hair more violent
however store-bought products usually
contain chemicals in them which can
damage your hair so in this video I'm
going to be showing you two DIY natural
hair lightening sprays which will help
you achieve blond highlights or a
beautiful ombre I'm going to be starting
off with a camomile lighter spray the
first thing you're going to need is
Daisy tea or dried daisies to spray
bottles to put your mixtures in and
optionally some hair conditioner to give
your hair a soft touch next put some
water in a pot and then turn on your
stove and then you're just going to wait
for your water to boil the amount of tea
you're going to use depends on how
blonde you want your hair to be so the
more tea use look longer your hair will
get
once the water boils we can start
putting the teabags they can stay for
two to three minutes and the reason
we're using chamomile is because the
naturally light coloring of the flower
plus the natural chemicals help bring
out the blond in your hair once you're
done turn it off and set it aside so we
can cool off after it cools off a moonie
getting the teabags and then like
squeezing them with that little crap
thingamajiggy so you can get all the
excess tea out
and I can't take it you're even laughing
when you cry
beautiful hood after you're done with
that just get your spray bottle and
obviously open cap and I'm gonna be
putting in a funnel so it's easier and I
don't get it everywhere and put your
mixture into your little spray bar from
your I'm going to be putting in a little
squeeze of conditioner for that extra
softness and you're done just shake it
all up and you're finished the next one
is the lemon highlighting spray and for
this you're only going to be needing two
lemons and a glass of water that's it so
just start off by cutting your lemons
into two next I'm going to be getting my
electric juicer I think it's called a
juicer and I'm going to be juicing my
lemons
that's a nice circuit juice juicing yes
and then getting my spray bottle I'm
just going to be putting the lemon juice
3/4 of the way
and finally I'm going to be filling it
to the very top with some water and you
are finished with your second DIY the
last step is the most fun just braid
into your hair and go to the pool or the
beach and wait for it to Sun dry on its
own and this is before I put anything in
my hair and this is after don't expect
it to be platinum blonde the first time
you do it do it three times a week after
a few weeks you'll slowly see a progress
in your hair color so yeah thanks for
watching this video guys I hope you
enjoyed it see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
