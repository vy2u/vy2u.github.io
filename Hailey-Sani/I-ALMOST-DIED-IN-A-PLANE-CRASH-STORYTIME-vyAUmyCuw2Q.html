subscribe so when your Thursday so you
start off your videos saying subscribe
okay to say hey did you do to I created
this art piece it's my history project
actually I'm very proud of it I'm going
to be filming a story time video and
this is the story of how I almost died
in a plane accident plane crash new
season of loss that's what almost
happened to me basically so if you guys
didn't know last year I used to live in
instant knowing that was a lot not last
year that was like to sixth grade I'm a
tenth grade now anyway so I was in sixth
grade and I selamat Istanbul which is a
city and Turkey for those of you that
failed geography and history my mother
went to engineer which is another city
and Turkey around 45 minutes by plane
and she was there for around two weeks
to like a month I'm not really sure for
work one we get me my sister my dad
decided to visit her in Izmir so we got
some plane tickets to go visit her and
we're going to the airport no it was a
rainy day there was thunder and it was
nighttime I mean I guess the fact that
it was nighttime doesn't really change
anything but like it just adds more to
the story like that mirror the plane
takes off like normal planes doom and
everything is fine my family likes to
travel a lot so I've probably been on a
plane 300 times the least so this is
like not something new to me there was
slight turbulence to begin with this is
one of the exciting things begin so
there are slight turbulence and since
I'm so used to traveling turbulence
doesn't really bring out any weird
feelings in me what turbulence doesn't
tweet me it doesn't peak me new vocab
word we learn in class mate it's like a
plane shaking we're we're going to be
fine and there's a grain outside and
I don't even know if that safe like in
planes flying rain they shouldn't
obviously well understand from the story
my sister gets a little uncomfortable
she was like in third grade and then the
turbulence starts getting worse and
worse and I'm still not affected by it I
mean I'm a child with no feelings anyway
so like um I'll literally be like okay
like more shaking Disneyland you busy
and then the weird thing happened when
the plane keeps like go down and then
it'll start going up again so will go
down and you know the feeling when
you're on a roller coaster and the
roller coaster goes up and get like this
weird feeling your stomach that started
happening and I usually love that
feeling especially when I'm at
Disneyland but we're not a Disneyland
we're on a plane 40,000 feet above the
ramp so I want the same feeling exactly
and it's kind of raining and like it's
just like an awkward atmosphere like
planes going down there's turbulence my
sister's kinda getting freaked out and I
like love her to death like whenever
she's freaked out I start you know
getting freaked out for her because I
love her so much so my dad keeps like
looking at me like making sure we're
okay keeps like looking at us and I'm
just like okay like what is going on
like this is just turbulence we're gonna
be fine so then the plane goes down like
like it like drops and like it's still
in the air but it's like dropping and
dropping and I'm like oh my god we're
gonna wear this is the plane is going to
fall that's what I'm I start kind of
panicking which is weird because I
usually don't have emotions so I'm like
oh my god like I just look at my dad and
like dad like what's happening he's like
oh nothing
like everything's going to be fine and
then the most scariest thing of my whole
entire life happens we hear it as a big
bomb Sam and it goes boom it probably
did calling that but it was like this
boom like it was a bomb scam all we see
is this orange light like this orange
light films up my sight and all I see is
this just like it's really bright orange
light for like four five seconds
straight along with this noise and now
people are going crazy like the plane is
shaking like as you'd see in movies
there's this weird-ass orange light and
my sister is like crying this old lady
jumps out of her seat starts running
across like the whole of the airplane
like screaming she's like we're gonna
add like she's like literally saying
we're gonna die and there are kids on
this plane like old ladies sit your ass
down
like shut but you don't know what you're
talking about the like air hostess
ladies like ma'am can you please I see
and like you can tell she's crying too
and I'm like okay it's the air flight
attendant is crying you know something's
up everyone in the plane is literally
crying or screaming you see people like
pulling out their phones like trying to
like text their family I'm like what
like don't you know you're not supposed
to do that
but I guess like if we're gonna die as
you could try like I don't know I was
think I'm a weird job and then my father
looks at me and my sister and he goes I
love you girls don't ever forget that
and I go dad this is not the time to be
like talking like this this little girl
we my sisters it's literally seven years
old she's crying right now
you're supposed to be like oh it's gonna
be fine guys like if we die we have a
diamond piece we can't be thinking like
oh like we're dying and but at least my
dad knows this you know so then our very
dear amazing pilot he like puts on the
speaker thing and he's like always
slight turbulence slight turbulence
really fly are you kidding me like
pretty sure there was a bomb in her
flight right now and we don't
I don't freaking know what this orange
light in my face is and this bomb sound
like are we being attacked by terrorists
so then you guys out there was uh our
plane was hit by a lightning bolt but
the parrot on her picked it up hair
toner is that what's called I need to
google that because that's what's called
Turkish but I know it's called me
English BRB my foreign s just made sure
I was speaking English still so yeah he
was like oh the parrot owner picked it
up so there's like no problem like
however we won't be landing in Izmir
today we're going back to Istanbul and I
was like okay like freely like I could
see the airport from the window and they
were like oh we can't land here there's
too much rain and oh yeah just chill
like no I just want to go to Izmir so I
can see my mother I was just like can we
just like get off right now join just
like parachute jump right now I
literally see the airport like it's okay
I'm fine I can deal with this but at the
same time I'm kind of like okay good
like at least we didn't get attacked by
terrorists and I still get how the signs
of that works like apparently our
airplane has a pair of toner on I guess
that makes sense cuz then I'm like
picked up the light but it was just
weird I felt like we were out being
abducted by aliens at the same time so
then our plane like turn around but
there was turbulence the whole way back
so yeah that was the time I was dead
plane crash let me know if you would
like to see more story types in the
future I'd only have a good handful that
I'd like to share with you guys because
a lot of Shh unnecessary things go on in
my life if you like this video or if you
want to see more story times like this
make sure you give it a thumbs up down
below and stripe I love you
so much all the way to Pluto</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
