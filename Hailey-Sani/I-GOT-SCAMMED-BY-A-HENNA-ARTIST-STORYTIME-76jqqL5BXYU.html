gonna be filming a story time video you
guys really like my previous story time
the time I almost died on plan I'll link
it down below let's jump right in so
this story occurred a day before
Coachella and I want to look a one at
the festival I just want to look good
because I knew everyone else there would
be looking good and yeah so my outfit
they were bomb like I book shave my legs
and stuff for this so like you know it's
important when you like shave your legs
so there were three things that I wanted
to do before I went so one I wanted to
get acrylics to I want to get my
eyebrows threaded and three I want to
get a white hen out because yes I'm a
white girl and yes I'm a basic bitch and
me being the lazy ass leaving it to the
last day ass girl that I am I didn't get
around to doing any of these until like
the day before we left by the day before
we left I mean like a p.m. you see what
I had planned on doing was coming home
from school going to the nail salon and
then me and my mom we're gonna go to
Venice Beach to get henna tattoo cuz I
didn't know where else to get a henna
tattoo like it was a p.m. on a Wednesday
night
I know Coachella was on Friday but me
and my manager my like garage we left a
day earlier and you see henna artists
are really giving Hennis to people at 8
p.m. on Wednesday nights I've been
speech
but got back from school on Wednesday
and I said I'd take a 15-minute nap I
woke up at 8 p.m. and I hadn't done
anything so I was like holy guac
freaking hell what do I do
like it's a p.m. I didn't I was
stressing like I knew that a henna
tattoo was like the most important out
of the 3 because like you could see them
pictures and videos and I don't like fit
the vibe I guess so I was like ok like I
can't go to Venice Beach at 8 p.m. I
don't want to die today like I'll just
look up like a tattoo parlor that does
hennas or some something like that I
yelled a henna artist and near me and
like a few things popped up they're all
close they were all like closing at 7:00
p.m. and it was like eight thirty miles
time and then I found this one guy on
Yelp and it was like henna artist we can
come to you or something like that like
henna artist that came to your house
that did your henna which is kind of
sketchy I knew I was going to get ripped
off because every henna artist knows
it's Coachella the day after and
especially when you're calling them at
8:00 p.m. like asking for a henna
they're gonna rip you off he was like a
Mexican man and he answered the phone he
was like yeah like I'll do it for like
okay mesons don't speak in a British
accent I don't know where that came from
he was like yeah like I'll do it like
for 250 and I was like - when he was
like 250 like why does my Mexican man
keep speaking to protect that I
understand it was like okay I'll do it
for $250 I was like Miguel like brah
like come on yeah like I can't do it for
250 I was like yeah but like I don't
want to give you 250 he was like okay
I'll do it for like 100 first of all how
did the price go from 250 to 100 Miguel
and he was like I'll have to charge you
like an extra $20 to like come to your
house and I was like Miguel like on your
Yelp it says you only come to houses now
you're charging me extra money for
coming to my house as if I like it's
like my personal order he was like okay
then you can come to where I am and I'll
give you a henna and I was like me Jeff
I don't know you I ain't about to come
to you okay I talked to my mom and my
mom was okay like we can meet at like a
public place till I get the henna so it
won't be like sketchy and I was like oh
yeah like you're right like thanks mom
like why can I have some of that brain
I'm Turkish so like I bargain because
that's like in my genes so it's like
okay like eighty dollars we're doing
this and he was like okay yeah like
eighty dollars is fun
Miguel doesn't talk like that but I I
don't know how Miguel talks at this
point anymore I kind of won't forget
about Miguel Miguel is the henna artist
did I mention that okay it's 9:00 p.m.
by now
and Miguel sends me like the address of
the place he's at Miguel is in South
Central for those of you who have no
idea about Los Angeles which I don't
blame you at this point I do not know
what type of place South Central was so
central is not the right place to be at
9 p.m. on a Wednesday night I did not
know that my mother did not know that so
we hopped into her Jeter oke and we were
driving the South Central and things
started getting sketchier and sketchier
and at one point we were scared we did
not care about Miguel we did not care
about the henna we cared about getting
back home it was scary it was a dark
there were sketchy people around am i
sketchy I mean like gangs gangs og oh
you're such a drama queen I heard we
were gonna be at a McDonald's and so
then the GPS was like yeah just like
turn right and you'll be there in two
minutes
my GPS doesn't talk like that and I'm I
was like okay like we've come this far
let's just get your freaking henna
tattoo and get out here and I was like
okay so then we park at the McDonald's
parking lot the customers there breath
that hey let's just say nice so then I
text me get on I'm like yo we got like
we're here like right yeah and he was
like oh don't worry I got you like 10
minutes passed and we were just like in
the parking lot I was just like looking
at Miguel's like work that he'd done
before on Yelp and like I was like oh
that one's nice that one's nice like
everything looked pretty legit I was
like so excited yeah I might diamond.i
the lease I'll have to cool and attach
it like yeah so like 20 minutes roll by
25 and I'm like yeah like oh yeah do you

text and he's like oh I parked here and
then like me and my mom like you see him
he's like this little like short Mexican
guy he's like hey like Miguel I'm like
