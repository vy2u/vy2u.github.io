of Los Angeles hey guys its Neal here
and today I'm going to be filming my
moving to LA Q&amp;amp;A you guys haven't asked
me like a million questions ever since I
stepped foot in here so I just want to
like clear out the confusion answer all
your questions also before I get start
with the questions I really want to
quickly say that I am going to be
putting a story time video where I'm
telling you like my experience from like
the beginning to right now because it's
been really humorous really chaotic and
really different so I thought I just my
story time video because I thought it
deserved a video for itself okay let's
get started
the number one question I get asked is
why did you move to LA I moved here from
Jersey and like the political state
tricky it was just constantly going
downhill and I guess we just didn't want
to be in that environment plus like we
know the quality of life here in the
States compared to the quality of life
in Turkey and once you have a taste of
that and like you go back to Turkey it's
like I've always wanted to move to LA
because I thought it would be really
good for my youtube also because we just
really wanted to for a really long time
kasi asks do you think you'll ever do a
meet-up in LA and a lot of people also
asked this question and yes what better
place would there be to have Meetup if
you live in this area and if you think
you'd come if I had a meet-up leave a
comment down below because I don't want
to like have a meet-up and like no one
shows up and it's just me pre-madonna ml
asked do you think foods in LA are
unhealthy
yes and no if you got to follow me on
like any social networking site you guys
would know that my diet is mostly
plant-based if there
a vegan or vegetarian alternative on the
menu I will 100% pick it
I feel like food here is healthier but
it's also unhealthy because there are a
lot of junk food options that are really
good but there are also a lot of
delicious healthy options so I guess it
just depends on your diet and your
lifestyle kena Lisa asks when do you
start school I actually went to school
today I went there to take a test
because since I moved here from Turkey
they made me like take an English
learners test I don't even know I was
supposed to start school tomorrow
tomorrow's Veterans Day and there's no
school so Thursday days what are you
most scared about going to the new
school and what are you most excited for
this is such a good question because I
have things scaring me and stuff that
I'm excited about things that are
scaring me one the school school is huge
I'm going to be like lost and late to
every class perks of being the new girl
though like nobody really cares another
thing I'm scared about is lessons
because I haven't gone to an American
school for like four years and I went to
a French school last year and all that
we spoke was French so like now I'm
going to a English school unlike way and
things I'm excited about is actually the
same thing I'm scared of friends like
I'm excited for making new friends yes
I'm talking too much that always happens
in my videos will you go back to your
kitchen see your friends and family of
course I will I mean like imagine not
being able to see the member again like
so many of you guys asked me if I'm
living alone if I moved alone no I'm 15
there's no way my mom or my dad would
ever let me move across the globe
to a city like Los Angeles all by myself
they did tag along somebody asked me
would you rather have a house in Laguna
Beach or la so when we first moved here
we really want to live in one of the
beach down and we did find a house
something really funny happened that I
will include in my story time video and
we didn't manage to get it it was
actually funny it was just really like
sad and heartbreaking but the situation
was so bad that it was humorous to me we
like completely change your mind every
time I went there like remembered what
happened and it was just if that hadn't
happened to us we would have definitely
been living in Laguna Beach right now
but it did and I guess things happen for
a reason because now that we've moved
here I like this area much more so la so
many of you asked will I be uploading
the room makeover or like room tour when
I move yes because of the house that
we're moving into is unfurnished and we
don't have any furniture so that means
like I get to use my creativity it will
be a make over because we're making the
rooms not over make it for the first
time our room make it for the first time
are you happy to live in LA or was
turkey better when all those stuff
happened in Laguna Beach I was so upset
I was like this is all my fault because
I really wanted to move here I was like
I wish we never moved you want to move
back to here I'm gonna go back to my
family I want to go back to my friends I
just want to go back to my old school
like now it's been like two weeks I am
so much happier I don't know if you be
patient be positive like spread positive
vibes and everything will be perfect so
yes I am happier here than I was in
Turkey the only thing that makes me
unhappy is the fact that my family and
my friends are so far away from me a lot
of you asked me if I'm still talking to
Emily how she reacted like basically my
move
Emily situation when Emily found out I
don't even think she'd build leave me
because she was like yeah surely you'll
move yeah
but then everything just happened in
like I feel like she's still with me
because we're talking like every day the
time difference is really bad like 12
hours like are you kidding me I don't
think it will ever go away I think we're
going to talk every day until I go back
in the summer to see her and the last
and number-one question you guys have
been asking me is how was life in LA
living here has its ups and downs like
traffic like you know so many good
places so much fun so many good people
such nice opportunities especially for a
content creator but it's not LA that
makes living here so good it's what you
make out of LA well that was deep I like
to take my dog on a walk and like
explore go to places I've never been
walking the streets look that's for the
studio guys I'm going to be uploading so
much more now that you guys know what
type of videos I'm gonna be filming
videos that I actually want to film I
want to talk to you like I want to like
talk to you and stuff like that yeah
it'll be all the way to go oh my god bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
