a sheep to say hey did you chew salmon
refilling a snapchat Q&amp;amp;A I have these
every once in a while so you should
definitely take a picture of that Adam
agency selfies a cute friends make you
dog funny videos of my sister so I'm
going to be answering some of y'all's
statue questions she was gorgeous oh my
god that would like the prettiest girl
I've ever seen and thank you for this
question
I've been wanting to talk about this for
so long but I just never had a video
where I could like add this to it
so thanks for that question um when you
guys call me like goals it kind of makes
me really sad because I don't want to be
your goals I want your goals to be the
best version of yourself don't ever
think of someone else's goals don't ever
want to be someone else because you
never know how their life really is like
trust me the best version of yourself
would be better than any other person or
any other goal that you could ever have
you all are so pretty I'm five three by
three and a half guys going strong girl
I've been thinking about this for like
the longest time ever since I've moved
here
there's certain things that make me so
much happier because obviously I didn't
have access to those things when I was
living in Turkey here it's like oh I can
do this
they sell raspberries here raspberry
there ten out of ten
I met so many new people I know so much
I have so many more friends here like
I've made so many friends in these past
two months that I have ever when I was
in Turkey
at the same time it's like are these
things really worth giving up family and
my best friend and you know my life in
Turkey like it or is it worth it I've
been questioning that so I don't really
have an answer to that question yet I'll
probably tell you like next year okay so
my question is oh we're doing to travel
like visit somewhere like I love
traveling if you like that so I travel
somewhere so yeah she's so pretty girls
so pretty
god bless um we're going on travel girl
I want to travel everywhere
but now ATM Australia London I want to
go to Venice and Japan I want to go
there because apparently the public
toilets have blow dryers on them and I
probably the only reason I want to go
there I am I love you alike a lot you're
like one of my inspirations and um my
question is how do you stay so positive
and stuff um how do I think so positive
I'm not really that positive like I
tried to be positive sometimes I'm not
it's like you know I'm gonna do a video
on that talking about how to be positive
something I can tell you like a teaser
to my upcoming positivity video catch
yourself when you're in a negative
situation thinking about a negative
thing and turn it into a positive thing
that's what I've been doing a lot and
it's definitely helped and by the way I
love your nails in the video it's like
beautiful do you feel when you see your
parents watching your YouTube video I
like make them watch my youtube videos
they watch it's them anyways but like
they always like criticize them like
positive Co cessation of the
discrimination perk
oh you're my inspiration I love you how
to be successful youtuber stay
consistent create content that you would
watch yourself and that you feel
confident and do something that you put
a lot of effort into because success
only comes with hardwork I feel like
your teachers oh my god can they get any
cuter I've never been to Ireland I mean
I want to go there I'm gonna go
everywhere Haley if you're watching this
I just want to say thank you so much for
getting me to fitness I love your videos
and your literally goals and my question
is what motivates you to wear I guess
okay I don't want to be your goal your
goals what motivates me to work out um
