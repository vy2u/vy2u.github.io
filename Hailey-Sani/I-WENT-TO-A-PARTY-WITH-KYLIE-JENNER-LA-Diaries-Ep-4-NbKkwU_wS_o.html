of Los Angeles this is Ellie Diary 2.0
currently in izmir and we're headed back
to Los Angeles and Lily thought this
woman was real and I said hi to her
we're in our la fun what is this I have
to stop this vlog right now because this
is taking over it
Oh
la Diaries once again a year later holy
guac now we're moving into another
apartment from the one we moved into
last time I wasn't like this permit a
lot better to look at the lighting in my
room it's quite the moving people are
putting our stuff in our apartment right
now quick overview of my room I mean
it's not too bad like I'll be honest
it's a lot bigger than my room last year
or kid she's pretty how do you ratchet
looking I need to be out in like two
hours I'm going to a fitting for boo-hoo
update of what my room currently looks
like so the moving guys just left this
place is still pretty ratchet but I'm
currently waiting for Izzy to pick me up
so we can go to the boo boo showroom
Jordan woods whoo if you don't know who
she is she's like Kylie Jenner's best
friend she's hosting an event tomorrow
boo who invited me Lexi and they also
want us to wear clothes from their brand
go to their showroom picking out some
clothes oh my god is he just texted me
and she said some drivers driving like a
moron I'm sorry she's like so I'm like I
need to be there in seven minutes that's
not gonna happen but
I'm flexible pal so we're at the Palazzo
we're in the fitting for the p8 where
you go up to the 55th floor this doesn't
even have 50 so we're at the fitting and
it does not fit most of the clothes
don't fit me so yeah but I they fit me
so these steps on the thing it sounded
like a fart
we literally laughed at about it for
like three minutes strict Lexi did not
know when we were laughing about it I'm
got left alone in the fitting room
because I'm not trying on anything and
Oh Mike this is really far away from my
face when I was freaking ugly oh my god
maybe the lighting none of the lighting
made it worse okay well I couldn't go
downstairs because I'm not fitting for
anything and they probably think I'm
weird but um I'm just gonna talk to
Hayley's blog from this angle cuz I
thought this one is the best I'm
sweating I kind of like this one better
but like it's really not fitted so it
makes me look like I do not have us but
I don't know nothing you're 15 um guys
can we zoom in to Lexi's behind real
quick it's flexible it's bigger than my
whole future me and Lexi we both found
her dresses yeah I was the most
unenthusiastic year
that you I love you too Pluto and back
bye oh my god wait I'm cute you guys
could we talk about the sliding down my
stuff that I'm gonna wear tomorrow
hey guys this here and do icon like hide
ripples of self-forgiveness plating no

cheesecake factory it's Izzy Lexi and me

hello guys it is the next day and I just
got back from school a little update on
my room I mean it is still pretty messy
but I mean I have my bed in place I set
up my desk and most of my closet is done
in an hour so I'm gonna start getting
ready for the boo boo event tonight I
did my makeup however my hair needs
Jesus I'm usually really bad at makeup
this is like pretty new to me I've never
done that I am a dress on I'm gonna
accessorize it I don't know what shoes
to wear my nails aren't painted I gotta
go so I'm finally ready my hair is
curled and up I decided to go with just
this dainty necklace all right now we're

if she was actually going to that event
