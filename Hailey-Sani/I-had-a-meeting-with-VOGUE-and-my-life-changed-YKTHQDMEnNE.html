like this is a literally a dream come
true for me like I'm going to a Vogue
event where there's gonna be like tons
of top designers in the industry like
Rihanna's gonna be there like Marc
Jacobs Michael Kors like Anna Wintour
one's gonna be giving a speech and like
Virgil a blow like I like me saying
these out loud doesn't sound real for me
the fashion department of Instagram is
flying me out there but I do not have a
dress I don't know have shoes and I do
not have a bag I don't have anything yet
so me and my mom are on a mission we're
gonna get like the cutest outfit Melrose
grow bless you and then me and Neil are
gonna be getting her nails done
afterwards and we leave for New York
tomorrow I'm pumped I'm so excited I was
like literally a little girl in like
Turkey like whoever no yeah blue cheese
there ones and a white zo6 hanging out
the window like EF be on one off a
bottle might be my tree smoking Agent
Orange I see that with me and Marty was
recording at my mom's we'll see how her
chase around Bob's
good morning guys it is Wednesday it's
travel day we're on our way to New York
well we're not on our way up to New York
II yeah they're gonna be sending over a
car to her house at like 10:00 to pick
us up and take us to the airport which
is quite fancy if I may say I'm just
going over all the reminders I put on my
phone last night just making sure I
didn't forget anything
I'm excited know what house party like
cool when you stay at turn upside down
that artwork on the wall zipper to the
bathroom and they work in this table now
on my mom have to wait in that line but
I just get to cut in front of everyone
and I don't even know why I just went
through security I like got to go in
really fast now and my mom did it so
they're like waiting in line right now
head over to my gate so I can wait for
them there and then if I see a Starbucks
and away happy break this is a hotel
room I'm obsessed with the view like
this is insane
hey guys it's why I look like ass that
flap so it's Thursday morning it's like
5:45 a.m. or something but I have hair
and makeup in like 15 minutes so I have
to get ready for that I'm still in the
bathroom that's fun I might just go like
this honestly cuz I don't even know what
I'm wearing for sure yet I went to bed
at like 2:00 a.m. woke up at like 5:30
a.m. so running on a good three and a
half hours of sleep my AC was being
annoying the whole fucking a night like
it wouldn't stop like making so much
noise oh my god please leave me alone
like no joke I'm contemplating between
this like red silky dress and then this
like black dress with an open back and a
slit in the front so I ran out of
contact lenses so I had to put in like
expired ones this is like really bad for
you and everything but like I read
online that if you like make sure
they're really clean you'll be fine so
hopefully if I get an eye infection
it'll be worth it so this is my outfit
for the event
get my wave can you do my hair everyday
like before school and we're on our way
to the conference I guess we're going to
start off with
yeah
sorry I'm wearing this chart I'm like
I'm literally freezing in my hotel room
and I can't figure out how to fix the AC
but quick recap of how my day ended so
after a whole vote conference ended and
Rihanna did her panel me the other
influencers and the Instagram team we
all went to get pizza excuse you how
dare you we went to this Italian place
called Rubirosa which is apparently the
only play fashion people go to eat carbs
that's how Instagram described it to us
and the food was heavenly literally so
delicious I'm so full I gained like four
pounds today so then we came back to the
hotel and then I saw that Travis Scott
was having like a mini concert at his
like pop-up shop so we got in an uber
and we went I managed to get in somehow
we had so much fun me and Nell we're
literally dancing so much I left around
11:00 because I'm just so tired I'm
gonna go to bed soon but before I do
that I want you guys the gift bag that
Vogue a vuss because they gave us this
huge gift bag and it's like it's vogue
so I'm so excited to see what's in here
they were kind enough to print this
picture of me onto the bag which is just
like so sweet of them and then there's
this like leather badge so everyone at
the event had these but it's basically
like a Polaroid camera I guess but it's
like not Fujifilm it's HP so I'm excited
just try that they also gave me film
Thank You HP and whoo we have a pair of
Michael Kors sunglasses they look like
this they're not the cutest but thank
you anyway
Stella McCartney gave us this perfume
Marc Jacobs beauty let's see oh they
gave us this mascara which I will not be
able to use into my eyelash extensions
fall out but thank you oh my god
Instagram so cute they gave us this like
Instagram ring light to take selfies
which is always a must this mizzle
mashallah
does that say bougie perfume that's
literally me like this is me as a
perfume the whole event was sponsored by
milk makeup and it also like took place
in their building so milk makeup gave us
all these like a different stakes that
I've heard a lot of good reviews about
this sunshine oil and then a tattoo
stamp Michael Kors also gave us this
short that says watch hunger stop and
this is the softest material that I've
ever touched in my whole entire life
you know I'm gonna be wearing this every
day of my life so that was everything in
this goodie bag thank you to all these
brands and especially vogue because they
really came through tomorrow also gonna
be a super exciting day we're gonna be
going to the Instagram headquarters and
I was also gonna be joining me and we're
gonna be meeting the whole team today I
met such amazing people I met the
creator of Instagram he was the sweetest
dopest guy I've ever met like literally
I was talking to him I felt like I was
like talking to a friend because he was
just like he just like from the way he
talks he was so like down-to-earth and
humble and like he literally created
Instagram but he doesn't even act like
half the people that think they're a
piece of shit because I have followers
on Instagram like this guy literally
owns Instagram and it's just crazy yeah
I met Anna Wintour I took a picture with
her like literally a once in a lifetime
opportunity I met Marc Jacobs we took
pictures Virgil a blow like I took a
picture with him I look so bad in a and
I regret it so bad that I didn't check
after I took the picture but one of my
favorite panels was Stella McCartney's
because she talked about the ethical
methods of creating fashion and how the
fashion industry is the second most
harmful industry to the planet her whole
line is basically vegan and like it was
very inspirational like her message
anyways I'm gonna be going to bed now
