get some tips it's gonna be like a
meeting I think other influencers are
going to miss my outfit it is styled by
new
I want to work in an office that has
board games like just in the lounging
area first of all I want an office that
has a lounging area they have mini golf
in the office we all got food go ahead
so I got the most weirdest thing I can
cheese pizza what's over there
oh damn so we're gonna be getting like
personal feedback on all of our
instagrams and getting like personal
tips and then afterwards were going into
like an interview and like talking to
someone one-on-one I don't I really
don't know how it's gonna work I don't
know what they're gonna ask us I'm kind
of nervous here is Bessie she's giving
us insights on her Instagram account
she's telling us we suck Melanie told us
we need a fix our instagrams based on
like statistic she works at Instagram so
she has like all these like cool like
behind-the-scenes tips comment if you
want to know what she told us there's no
grabbing some snacks if I worked here
I'd gained like 10 pounds in like a week
because all this like free food is laid
out for you to like indulgence we were
just told we're gonna be doing this a
video for Instagram where we're gonna be
doing like a video for their kind
comment series they're gonna be pulling
up like kind comments from you guys on
our instagrams and then they're gonna
read them to us and then film a reaction
it sounds like so cute
we just wrapped up at Instagram and now
I'm going back to the hotel we have our
flight back to LA tomorrow so I miss my
dog and my boyfriend and I'm kind of
excited I'm back in the hotel but I want
to take a little nap before we go out
tonight because I'm so exhausted just
left the hotel room again outfit change
it's currently seven hour reservation at
Nobu is at 10 that gives us three hours
to do whatever we might go to tennis
player because that's my favorite place
in the whole entire world so excited for
Nobu is my favorite restaurant in the
whole entire world and I've never been
to the one in New York I've only been to
the one in LA so it's gonna be exactly
can you tell where we are I Love New
York like no one even cares about the
street life like you just cross no
matter like it's red or green
we just finished dinner the food was
amazing
we are back in the hotel I'm in my hotel
room I just packed my suitcase
I got everything I'm wearing to the
airport ready a car is gonna be picking
us up from our hotel room tomorrow
morning and taking us to JFK and we're
gonna be boarding her plane to go back
to LA this was honestly one of the best
two days of my life like I learned so
much from like such important people
I feel like this trip kind of changed my
perspective on how I view myself as a
brand but also connect with you guys and
like not in a brand way at all just in
like a friendly like authentic way
because like that's what we've been
doing since the beginning of when I
started my youtube channel basically and
that's why it it's always worked out
because I've always been myself and it
also changed my perspective on viewing
fashion and designers and the forces of
fashion the amount of names I like even
if I didn't personally meet them I got
to see like the real vet and now I like
never look at their brands or their
clothes or their companies the same way
because I I know how they are personally
that's either bad or good cough cough
Marc Jacobs anyways again I just really
want to thank the Instagram team and
Betsy I love you guys so much all the
way to Pluto and back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
