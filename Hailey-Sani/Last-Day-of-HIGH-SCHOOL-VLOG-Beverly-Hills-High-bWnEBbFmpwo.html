you can my shiny your showy pants yeah
wow you're just so courageous girl
we are watching a movie we're watching
lol my favorite movie Lowell
I was Miley Cyrus I'm leaving you now
I'm going home
yep I just got home from Nicky's I was
my little puppies now later today we
have this thing called senior sunset
where our whole grade comes together at
our football field watch the Sun go down
and like apparently people give speeches
and it's really emotional I don't really
want to wear makeup to that so I'm just
gonna head over to my bathroom so I can
have a fresh clean face so I'm gonna be
taking my makeup off using the Clinique
take the day off cleansing balm
I've definitely talked about this in
like previous skincare routine videos
and I use this it's my Holy Grail it
takes off all my makeup off this is the
only cleanser I have to use when I want
to remove my makeup just because it does
such a good job taking everything off
like all the makeup you have on your
face even like really tough and stubborn
like the scare eyeliner that tend to
usually stay even after use a cleanser
I'd only have that problem when I use at
my Clinique balm so what I like to do is
grab a little chunk it's like a soft
balm and then I just rub it in between
my fingers and just rub it on my face
and it turns from a bomb into like a
really soft oil so yeah I just like to
put the balm on and then rub it into my
skin and the oil does a really good job
just like breaking apart your makeup on
your face and then I like to do it on my
eyes
and I have a baby clean space and it
doesn't feel dry you know that feeling
like when you wash your face and then
your skin literally feels thirsty just
because it's so dried out
I like it because since it's like an oil
formula I feel like it's really
moisturizing on my skin and I don't even
feel very like tight but I'm gonna go
ahead and use my moisturizer anyway just
because I love that glow I'm gonna be
strides through make sure you're faced
with and they're actually having a
promotion in the month of July
if you shop any of their cleansers or
their makeup removers you're going to
take home with you some of their teeth
