to be filming my lazy day routine so the
first thing I do is wake up obviously
and then I put on my glasses because I
don't want to be blind I'm lazy but I'm
not that lazy and then I yawn just like
in the movies and then I drink some
water because usually I'm really
dehydrated and I go my phone because I
have a social life quote quote sizzle so
I go on the three mains Instagram
Twitter snapchat and when I'm on
snapchat I look at the NYC story and cry
a little predicted when I decide I've
cried enough I get out of it and I head
over to my computer
and Kennedy
so I usually check my emails cuz I'm a
businesswoman like that you know and I
catch up on my YouTube subscriptions and
I also reply to your guys's comments
because they always brighten up my day
after I make sure I haven't missed
something like outstripp'd I get or the
dress I finally get off the internet and
go to the bathroom
question two the two
I take care of my hygiene by brushing my
teeth
usually I don't put my contacts on on
lazy days but I didn't want to look like
Ugly Betty throughout this video so
you're welcome guys
after stretching impertinent window for
no reason at all I decided thoughts and
slugs and then I go down to the kitchen
because there's food there so for
breakfast that day I made myself some
grilled cheese I just love it when your
cheese melts everywhere so next I put on
my Citarella slippers and my best
because I'm gonna be walking my dog and
I always like to bring my phone and my
headphone because I like to listen to
music while I'm on the run we could
start a farm and then I win next my
little baby my little puppy look out
beauties wait for me you could really
tell it's spring right
and after that run or should I say being
dragged everywhere by my puppy I crawled
up the stairs back to my room so I used
the opportunity that my body was already
warmed up to do some pop pilates by
Blogilates and while doing that I opened
up some music for myself
you go girl you get those abs burn
at this point I'm a filthy sloth so I
need to take a shower in in the shower I
use my Bluetooth waterproof speaker and
I got this off of CN direct I'll link it
down below and the speaker is the second
best invention after Nutella and the
website is super expensive and they ship
worldwide so if you want to have a disco
showers and should definitely look into
this item after taking a shower it's
lunch time so I was having some broccoli
with some brown rice and yogurt I finish
off the day by just doing some lazy
things like going on my iPad and
watching TV shows reading going on my
phone and that's my whole lazy day
thanks for watching this video guys and
I love you all to Pluto and back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
