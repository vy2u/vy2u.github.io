you didn't get anything yet Oh yo yo me
I'm ugly literally look at me and look
at football yeah
we'll show you once we find stuff
hey what are you doing here get out of
my room I'm just gonna film your room
makeover part to your viewers really
want to see it you know but my room's
not finished yet to show it as it is
yeah okay if they really want to see it
I'll show them hey guys it's Ian here
and today we're gonna be filming my room
makeover part two I've been living in
here for two months so I think that
calls for our room tour so let's get
started
nothing changed since the last video I
stood up my door I still got my wardrobe
but when we come here I did change a few
things in my bedside table I got this
plant and I've got some knickknacks that
just add to the whole theme of like
neutral colors and stuff a candle and
I've got my water drink your h2o kids
and then I have my bed and to be honest
my bed is probably my least favorite pot
in my room right now the pillows are
really boring although I did get this
blanket and it's super soft I love this
whole like warm tones and to cover up
the disgusting wine grain if you could
remember from my last video I got myself
a bedskirt and when I have a best girl I
feel like those English physicists from
like the 18th century add a golden dream
right and then over here I've got my
vanity again nothing change I just have
some lights going on hey what even is a
tumblr
have me some fairy advice and I got
these from CN direct.com
and I love them they have been working
for like three months they are
completely fine as they change patterns
and stuff and they were like 20 meters I
really loved them they were super
affordable and Sandra also sells like
clothes and I got my shirt from there
and it's really tender as well and I'll
definitely link that website down below
they're moving on I've got myself a
curtain and I didn't really pick this
out my mom scot-free and she also pulled
this lucky eye over here because I don't
really use my Corinne but I thought it
was a really cute I've got a beautiful
view and I'm so blessed to be able to
live in such a lovely home with such a
lovely view and then we've got my TV
again I got one's good more rounded and
I got this bookshelf she put my TV on
and if you guys remember in my last
video I said I was going to get my TV
mounted onto the wall but then I didn't
know what I would do with my book so I
thought I just use it as two and one TV
stand bookshelf so I've got like all the
books that I really like I've got my
boxing gloves and jump ropes because
hashtag Fitness and I've also got my DIY
box for when I do DIYs which is like
never and sorry about that I've got my
desk desks yeah as you can see there's
like three deaths I've got my youjin
planner which has all my secret ideas
that I do bear B clips and I've got like
a candle a cactus I don't know why but I
feel like plants make
much more happy you know plants and
friends and that I've got my money jar
with like ten bucks
so hashtag rich and some lotion then
I've got my iMac and if you guys
remember I said I was going to buy
myself a ghost chair and draped like
this blanket over it then I found out
those chairs cost like 400 bucks and I
was like yeah I'll just choose my spin
chair then I'm behind Pilates mat and my
tripod and then I stood back here I've
still got a mini-fridge absolutely no
food because I was just too lazy to go
shopping for it and to be honest that
makes a water noise and when I'm
sleeping at night there has to be like
zero noise so that's pretty much
impossible when I have this turned on
and on top I've got my favorite bag that
I use every weekend and in this plastic
box I just got some like people's
electronic charters random stuff to be
honest I really hate this mirror because
it makes you look like three times
thicker than you actually are
to finish off this room tour I've got
two months two months two roses I've got
this fake sheepskin one and I have this
one which is like I never go on my bed I
always lay down on my carpet because it
is super soft and I'm in love that I got
it from English home and that concludes
my roommate group
- I know was it what you guys were
expecting you guys are probably
expecting me to be like having awesome
cool amazing DIY tumblr stuff but guys
I'm not creative like that and I like
simplicity and this is basically
simplicity and I'm really happy I'm
going to do guys and I love you all to
go and I buy many bottles of this one we
can't pronounce too many balls are that
grainy no Lucky Charms
The Maids come about too much parents
ain't no rounding up too many joy rides
and daddys Jaguar sweeping me blah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
