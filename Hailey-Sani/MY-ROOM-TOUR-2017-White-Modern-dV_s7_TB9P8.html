you guys my room tour this was really
requested you guys always request my
room tour every time I like post a
mirror selfie and you guys can see the
room in my background my room is pretty
like white and like aesthetically like
calming I feel like everyone that comes
into my room is like wow your room is so
nice because like it's kind of big and I
kept everything pretty like simple and
white but at the same time like really
chic and like cool wow I'm cozy and like
all these adjectives if you're not
subscribed already make sure you
subscribe and click the bell so you got
a notification when I upload which is
every Saturday and without further ado
let's hop into the video so this is the
front of my room it's just literally a
white door and when you come in the
first thing you see is my little dog
that's literally where he sits all day
every day
I'll do like a 360 degree overview so
here we go
and we're back in my door so when you
enter the first thing on your left
it's my full-body mirror which is hi
this is me I'm literally wearing my
Christmas pajamas because this is all I
wear throughout the month of December
but this is the infamous mirror where I
literally take on my outfit selfies
follow me on Instagram and snapchat
literally everything in my room is from
Ikea if something isn't from Ikea I'll
let you know
but this mirror like I said is also from
Ikea I love it it's really minimalistic
and I feel like the staple like peace in
my room is my rug because it is very
like out there and it's also for Mikey I
get so many questions on it but it's
basically this like geometrical like you
see what it is my room is pretty big and
it covers a good amount of it so yeah
right here I have my mirror that's Jax's
bowl and here I have the outs and
drawers that literally every basic
beauty guru has and you guessed it I
store on my makeup in here if you guys
want a makeup collection let me know and
I'd be more than happy to do that
my dog literally ate a corner of the
store before I even put this whole thing
together so that thing has been bugging
me and will probably bug me to the end
of my life until I get rid of these
drawers but right on top of that I have
my necklace stand this is actually from
home goods and I just keep all my
necklaces here I recently literally
ordered like so many necklaces so this
is gonna get a lot larger and I'm so
excited about that and here I have my
car keys and my house keys cuz like I
tend to lose them a lot and I feel like
right here is the perfect spot to not
lose them and this candle is literally
my favorite candle it's from Missoula
and it smells so good and this littlest
thing can make my whole room smell
incredible
moving on right here is my little office
space that's where all the editing
happens that's where my GPA happens
right in this little spot so starting
off I have my phone right here and then
I keep on my
cool books that I like to keep at home
right here that I don't really need to
take to school and this is my little
cork board usually it's stacked with
like a bunch of pieces of paper that
have to do with school but I kind of had
to take them down because they say like
where I go to school and like all my
personal information so usually this is
just filled with like papers that are
really important I'm literally a neat
freak I like to keep everything
organized I have these clips and
basically I like to clip on like again
important pieces of paper onto that when
I have things that are important like
literally right in front of me
I remember that I have to do them and
that's how I like stay on track and this
little corner I have most of my filming
equipment so like microphone camera
lenses stuff like that
here is my calendar I get one of these
every single year this is literally my
last sheet of this year because it's
December and that's just so sad like
this year went by so fast right here I
just have a bunch of drawers filled with
like school supplies camera equipment
junk drawer extra paper and like
shipping equipment for the things that I
sell like my depop and stuff like that
my desk itself is from Ikea it's not the
cutest desk but it gets the job done and
then my chair do not buy this chair it
is from Ikea it is so uncomfortable I'm
trying to get rid of it so bad if you
have any like chair ideas that are super
comfy cuz I said on my chair for hours
on hours on hours doing work and like
after sitting else for 20 minutes my
butt starts hurting like it's just a big
fat mess and it doesn't even roll like
it will drags like are you okay like
what the frig oh this is my backpack
here I have this lamp I just realized
it's really ugly like you probably would
try to replace that soon and I have
these two frames right here on this wall
that I bought literally six months ago
and they've been empty since I got them
like I never really got around to
putting pictures and then so if you
think like I have any pictures on my
Instagram that are worthy of like being
in these frames like comment on those
pictures and be like hey maybe you
should finally get those pictures
printed so you don't look like a crazy
person I've literally had a picture of a
picture frame with a picture in it for
the past six months sorry the lighting
is getting really dark right now
because all the light is literally
coming from here but I have this huge
window right here which is the source of
all the natural lighting in my room
so bless this whole window continuing on
the organized person and me never stops
so here I have this whiteboard and I jot
down like daily homework I've kind of
been lacking on this whiteboard recently
because I've just been so busy I don't
even have time to write on this and
usually I write like things I have to do
with YouTube but I erase those so I
don't like give you guys any sneak peeks
on what's coming up everything's a
surprise here I have this little box and
what's in these boxes are basically like
everything that's on my depop I have so
many things that I literally had to make
a closet for the things that I'm selling
on my depop and my depop is just my name
is Haley sunny I'm very active on there
I constantly upload new pieces of
clothing that's where I store all my
default clothes that I'm selling right
here in this little box that's Jackson
calls it I just like to keep all his
toys usually again they're literally
scattered all over my room but just for
the sake of the video I thought I'd be a
little organized and just put everything
in there and you're like what Haley you
have another door you just showed us
another door why do you have two doors
like don't tell my parents this I don't
even know if they know but this is
literally a door to sneak out of my
house
he's never usually this calm I don't
know what's happening so this painting
is by mr. brainwash it's so cute like my
boyfriend gave it to me yet here's my
nightstand
that's my nightlight it's really cool
like when I have all my lights down all
these like little specks of light go on
the walls and it's adorable again it's
from Ikea everything it's from Ikea
unless stated I just have my nighttime
necessity is so like glasses hair tie
this is a Bluetooth speaker Jack's kind
of ate it but it still works so props to
that I have hand sanitizer and this is
like my it's like a wellness liquid I
just like to drop a few drops into like
my water before I go to bed cause it's
like good for you and then here's a
candle this is my bed
oh my god you're so cute so I just have
a few throw pillows right here oh hello
Jax yes you're the star of the video
sorry didn't realize
I really like my bed the only problem is
the squeaky sound makes which I detest
usually I always have white bedding
because that's what I like this blanket
is from TJ Maxx also and this little
like long sheepskin but not real
sheepskin throw kind of thing is from
Target and I think was like 30 bucks a
good deal just adds a lot of coziness to
my room oh my god he's so adorable
on the top of my bed I have a bunch of
Polaroids I never told you where the
pillows are from so the two ones in the
back are from Marshalls East - I think
are from Target and that's also from
Marshalls death today here is my second
bed stand this is my laptop it's not for
my Kia it's actually from the Apple
Store
I like this that's a table better than
that one sorry that one just because
this is like so much cuter here I have
like these fake flowers don't tell
anyone they literally like made fake
water like that's not real water it's
glass but it looks real so it's cute
this is from home goods and then right
here I have the cutest little like glass
box I don't really know what to put in
it yet but it's just so like dainty if
you have any ideas of what I could put
in here let me know but I just felt like
I had to have it and then here's one of
my favorite candles mahogany teak wood
