and today I'm going to be filming my
workout routine and I thought I'd
actually take you through it every
single thing I do when I work out I
don't really have a routine that I do
every time I workout because if you have
a workout routine your body is going to
get used to that routine after a while
and it's not going to help you so every
time you work out you're challenged
ourselves to your fullest potential I'm
gonna stop working out what I know that
I've reached my capacity and I'm
satisfied with the workout I feel
exhausted and I feel good at the same
time before I get started I just really
quickly want to mention a fitness app
that I've been using for the past couple
of weeks it's gone rocker and it's like
the one stop shop for fitness videos
yoga videos and healthy cooking videos
so you get all three of those but the
ones I mostly focus on or yoga videos
and I like to do these after my intense
workouts as like a stretching routine
because I'm also working on getting more
flexible if you workout you know that
the best feeling is finishing a strength
training workout and then stretching and
like relaxing calming yourself and I
feel like rocker does that the best for
me there's at work out but workouts like
workout and it's the perfect alternative
to a gym because I know gyms can get
pretty expensive it's only nine dollars
a month because I have a forty percent
coupon code for you guys which will be
in the downbar and it's risk free if you
don't like it you can cancel at any time
and you get one month for free
personally what helped me get fit the
most or just online videos so without
further adieu let's get started with the
video
so I start off my workout routine with a
little bit of cardio and I don't do
cardio to lose weight I just do it as a
warm-up for my strength training so I
warm up for my warmup
by just walking for five minutes
after I'm done with my five-minute
warm-up walk I go ahead and run for 20
minutes without the never wanna leave
and by now I'm drowning in sweat IRL so
I cool down with another 5 minute walk
and after I'm done with my 5-minute
cooldown walk I move right on to
strength training when I'm working out I
always try ankle weights around my
ankles down and resistance and intensify
the workout and I start out with out
workout so I do 50 like lives on each
leg and then I do 50 fire hydrants which
is basically peeing like a dog and then
I knew 50 90 ups in a pulse rate and I
always do bridge workouts and make sure
you squeeze moving on I do 50 normal
squats and make sure you can see your
toes when you bent down and then I do 50
subbu squad and she's basically like an
almost ball with your wife's a little
wire apart it's a sign of fun and then I
do as many squawking so that I can and
these tail moving on to my abs I like to
work out my oblique blood I'm specific
cowboy cap that I follow every time I
work out I'm mostly like
you online videos and follow along from
there and there are a couple that I
really enjoy so I'll leave them in the
description box and you can check them
out no no no no no after around 45
minutes of strength training I'd like to
move on to some relaxing yoga and this
is my favorite part of my workout
because I get to stretch out my muscles
cool down and prove my flexibility and I
obviously go on Crocker yoga videos
because they're really fun to follow
along do some poses and you guys should
definitely try this out especially if
you have a really stressful and busy
schedule this will improve your mood
instantly moving on and I think it
should be somethin I don't wanna hold
back maybe you should
oh mama :
and I never liked
I was wrong and I've been so caught up
in my job didn't see what's going on
no my Elka's you feel like the way you
look so that's it for this video guys I
hope you all enjoyed it if you want me
to do a different video on my diet and
just fitness tips in general definitely
leave me a comment down below or give
this video a thumbs up so I know what
you guys want and I love you all so much
