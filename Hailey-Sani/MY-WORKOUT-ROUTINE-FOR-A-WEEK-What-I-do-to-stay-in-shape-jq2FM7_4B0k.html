it's Monday at 8:15 I'm currently
walking to my first workout class of the
week it's a soul cycle class and I
usually walk there because it's like a
warm-up it's not that far from my house
so it's like one of my favorite classes
so I'm a hundred percent sure this is
going to be so fun and a great way to
start off the week
I'm just munching on some dried fruit
and nuts on my way there because usually
I work out in the morning and I don't
like having a big breakfast before work
towels or like dried fruit and nuts
perfect why am I out of breath I'm so
out of shape I haven't worked out in
like six weeks throughout the whole
summer
so this is gonna be really intense yeah
blue jeans are ones and a white page
post big singing out the window like I'd
be on one bottle I be my tree smoking
agent orange I seem empty and Marty was
reporting on my mom shower chasing round
blob I was in the lab hoping on my job
that will be based around mops down
yeah she no let me cook my ego
I just got out of class
sorry I couldn't really spell when I was
actually working out my hair is wet it's
like soaking wet but that was a good way
to start off working out since I've been
off track I'll be honest is really hard
because I was really struggling to keep
up with everyone around me but overall I
feel really good about myself
let's kick it off say baby bubble say
sister no something no something no sir
okay that was slipping off give me don't
give me those champagne bubbles just hit
the nose the nose the nose and bingo
except the nose and on personal banking
on a soap you can take a bath on the
thirty ratio and the compression you can
get my keys in my coat check it in the
back of the bus to show it's the next
day I'm not logging while driving max
was just in an alley since I'm pretty
sore from yesterday's workout my body
was a little rusty than I thought today
I'm going to be taking it kind of easy
and for today's we're okay I'm just
gonna be going on a hike

workout was really good workout

big size to get some boxing gloves we

I just got back home from my workout
that was such a crazy workout either me
nor Nicki had ever tried boxing before
so I was very interesting but it was
also really fun we were laughing the
whole time just kind of like what's
important our hands were literally
shaking when we were done I may be so
sore tomorrow I'm not excited for that
hey guys so sorry I was like a mess but
I'm just Mickey again we're on our way
to a poun event they are hosting like a
hip-hop yoga workout class this morning
so we're going we're going to be a
little late I literally forgot to send
in the water to wake up and I woke up to
Nikki screaming her name outside my
window I wish I'd got a chance to like
you know not look like this this may be
like brush my teeth
we just finished our work out it was the
reverse out October 5 5 nahal's

good workout to do after boxing
yesterday release or my fingers my
fingertips are sore from this is
everything I was in the Puma goodie bag
they gave me is this yoga mat when I was
there and then these are really sick
shoes they look like this they have like
a metallic platform and then they say
Puma in the back I think they're really
dope dis these leggings that I had on
when I was doing the workout they gave
us a y7 class a keychain this shirt this

Polaroid camera this water bottle I know
being in this hair oil from away and I
love whey products these headphones so
that's basically was in the goodie bag
thank you to Puma for all the stuff we
really enjoyed today's workout

any crazy classes my body is literally
so sore I barely could get out of bed
this morning but I just say I'm going to
work out for a week and there's no
quitting now I'm just going to be doing
one of my asking where gasps quick not

yourself

Monday to now both mentally and
physically I feel like I'm back on track

Oh
Oh
I just finished my workout I feel pretty
good I'm really sweaty I just realized
my whole workout routine because I want
to say that for a separate video this is
like 45 minutes long so I can't squeeze
that into like the Friday bit of this
workout video so today was the last day
of my workout for the week I'm not going
to workout Saturday and Sunday because
I'm really sore and you often you take
rest days so your muscles repair
themselves that way they are more lean I
feel really good about myself I think we
killed it if you guys like these types
of videos and want me to do more of them
let me know even a lot of story I want
to give up I still kept going and it was
all worth it and because I feel so happy
I challenge you guys to do the same so
if you did something like this take a
picture every day and be Emmy or tweet
me nothing we were really happy to see
how strong you guys are thank you guys
so much for watching this video and I
love you guys so much all the way to
photo and back I
