gonna be sharing with you guys my
updated workout routine especially since
it's 2018 and everyone's like new year
resolutions trying to get more fit and
healthy I thought I would share my
updated workout routine with you guys
cuz I feel like it's been a minute I
post a lot of health and fitness related
videos so if you guys want to stay tuned
for that and make sure you subscribe and
click the little bell right next to it
so you get notified every time I upload
really quickly before I started I want
to briefly explain how my workout works
because in my pack workout routines I
always get comments saying like wait
when do you rest how many times you do
it like I'm confused so I just want to
clear everything out so you guys can get
the best workout out of this I'm gonna
do on my warmups which you'll see in a
few seconds I do every move 15 times so
every time I say rep it's like the
amount of times you do it so every 3
different exercises that I do I repeat
it again as an example I would do like
15 squats 15 burpees 15 sit-ups and then
I would rest and then I would do it all
over again so I'd do 15 squats 15
burpees 15 sit-ups and then I would rest
and then I'd do it one last time so I do
every exercise 15 times and then after
every three exercises I take a rest a
break and then I do it again two more
times I hope that wasn't confusing I try
to make it as clear as possible I'll
explain it further more in the video but
yeah that's all I really want to say
really quickly make sure you follow me
on my Instagram - that's where all the
bikini posts going all saying and yeah
without further ado let's jump straight
into this video let's burpees straight
into this video I think I said that in
the intro of my last workout video like
I have not changed usually if I'm
working out at home I like to warm up my
body on the treadmill so I'll like start
off with a walk and then I'll go into
around and I usually do like a mile jog
nothing like crazy this isn't even like
a part of the workout you're just
literally doing this just to warm up so
whatever warms up your body is fine
here are some other cardio workouts that
get your heart pumping so I like to do
like 30 seconds of jumping jacks
another good ones high knee so you're
basically like touching your hands with
your knees it is so important to stretch
out your body literally doing this for
five minutes before your workout can
save you so much pain on the days
following your workout my workouts
always start with burpees because it
just gets my heart racing and I already
start sweating before I even do anything
I only do around like 20 of these so
it's not a part of a set it's just like
another exercise to get my heart pumping
before my actual workout I have my ankle
weights on for most of my butt and leg
workouts because I feel like it just
gives you better results in the end so
the first exercise in my first set are
regular squats make sure you squeeze
your bum when you get to the top that's
why my butt looks kind of weird when I
get to the top next up we have sumo
squats which are basically like the same
thing except your needs are looking
outwards and your legs are slightly
wider apart squeeze your abs really
tight so that your core is engaged while
you're doing your squats next up we have
side leg lifts so I do 15 reps on each
side this is the third exercise of the
set if you prefer not holding onto a
wall and just using your core to like
get balance and also work on your abs at
the same time this is an even better
option so that was round 1 of the first
set and I can repeat two more times and
you don't actually have to do it like
sideways frontwards backwards I was only
just doing that to show you the correct
form moving on to the second set the
first exercise are squat Jones these are
really intense they get your thighs
burning your glutes are burning but the
harder workout is the more effective it
is so you're just gonna have to push
through these exercise number two or
front and back lunges so going forwards
and backwards ones counts as one rep and
then I move on to the second leg so I do
15 reps on that leg to
grab some water grab your resistance
band it's okay if you don't have one but
I definitely recommend you look into
purchasing one because it helps you so
much in your workouts I like to call
this the duck walk so basically you're
like doing a squat but you're not
actually you're just in that position
you can adjust your resistance band like
over your knees under your knees or
whatever you find a little bit more
challenging on your booty I don't really
have a specific number of steps I take
while doing this I just kind of do it
until my butt gives up and my legs can't
do it anymore and it's just like burning
like crazy that wraps up the second set
so you're just gonna repeat that two
more times
the first exercise of the third set are
leg lifts pulses so I put the resistance
band on my feet and I'm just like doing
the leg lifts kind of next up we have
side lunges so just alternate between
each side it's kind of hard to calculate
your reps with this so I just did 16
instead of 15 so that's an even amount
on each leg you can see my abs are
really engaged so make sure you squeeze
them next up we have lunges so lunge
backwards and then pull that same leg up
into your chest as high as you can going
backwards and then up counts as one rep
and repeat on the other side and this is
the last exercise of the set so repeat
the whole round two more times
moving on to ABS I'm gonna be removing
my ankle weights if you like that look
of like two smooth lines on the side of
your stomach this exercise will do just
that so just get in a side plank
position and drop your hips down and
repeat on both sides so here you're
basically like in a push-up position and
you just like I don't even not explain
the list you can just watch and see this
is also really hard to calculate as reps
so I just kind of do it until my abs and
my arms give up regular crunches look so
easy but it's just because you're doing
them wrong so you just have to move your
whole body using only your abs don't try
to pull your head up using your neck or
your arms or anything like that oblique
crunches are basically crunches but you
just move your legs to one side and just
use the side of your stomach to kind of
pull you up this is also good for
getting that toned like sleek sidecut
look
to get into the perfect form for leg
drops make your hands into a triangle
and place them right under your tailbone
this is gonna protect your back and
you're just gonna drop your legs as low
as you can and make sure that your lower
back doesn't come off the mat the slower
you can do this the better it is for
your abs I'm gonna be grabbing a weight
which is optional and the best way I can
explain this is get into like a banana
position and then make your legs and
your hands meet right like above your
stomach this burns like crazy my abs
were dying after this 100% of recommend
this one's pretty simple I'm gonna be
grabbing weights on both hands and just
pushing my hands upwards make sure you
squeeze your abs so this is the only way
it's gonna actually like affect your abs
this is also a good arm workout I'm
gonna be putting on my resistance band
in my ankle weights once again getting
in that cat position I'm gonna be
starting off with some straight leg
lifts moving on we have fire hydrants
you guys know the drill drill fire get
it Wow I don't even play that one and
then we have 90-degree curls you can
like keep your butt in a 90 degree
position and then pulse it if that's
what you prefer like kind of like what
I'm doing here and then 15 reps on the
other side because we don't want one big
butt cheek and the other one just like
small for the other sets I like to
remove my resistance band and basically
repeat what we just did two more times
that's how I like to finish off my
workout of course you have to stretch
stretch stretch like I said it's gonna
keep you from feeling so sore for the
next few days because this was an
intense workout that was it for this
video guys I hope you enjoyed it if you
did this workout Wow damn like you're
gonna look so good just keep doing this
like over and over again and your change
in your body is gonna be incredible if
you have any more fitness or health
related questions for me you can always
comment them
which is where I'll be more likely to
see them and that's it I love you guys
so much all the way to put out and back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
