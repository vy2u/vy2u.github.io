together we're like work out buddy wife
me up hey guys so I got out of school
I'm on my way to hop Pilates which is
what I've been doing lately and I'm
absolutely in love with it I had to take
a little break for the past like five
days so I haven't worked out in five
days which is really bugging me because
I wasn't feeling very well I'm kind of
just tired of waiting around to get
better so I just want to go work out I'm
lacking on them endorphins energy brings
energy so I feel like I'm gonna go work
out feel better actually have two
workouts today which was an accident so
I booked a Pilates class and then I
remembered that SoulCycle invited me to
try out their new like soul cycle class
like they're starting they haven't put
it out to public yet so they just asked
a bunch of influencers to come in and
try out their new soul cycle activate
class I believe that's what it's called
only thing I'm worried about is the fact
that I'm probably gonna be dead I'm
going to meet Izzy because she does
Pilates with me so this will be fun we
always work out together we're like
workout buddies because she's really
into being healthy and I'm really into
being healthy
it's ringing out with me is he's already
there shelter he did a class it's gonna
be her second class of the day goals
like I wanna be like her well I guess I
am today because I'm doing to work out
classes too so literally just realize I
completely forgot about an intro to this
video I'm filming an afternoon / night
routine vlog mission I already see it
she's prayin here what if Chantal still
there Chantel Jeffries I see her more
than I see my dad they're doing my
glasses I do I was gonna compliment you
on though this is the view of her
fucking Pilates class it's on sunset so
it's really pretty those are the hills
sunset Hales is that a thing Sunset
Hills I don't know I thought it was
recording it wasn't recording I thought
it was recording
hey guys I'm dead I just finished my
soul cycle workout so I did ha Pilates
soul cycle back-to-back it was so
difficult I like still managed to push
through so that's good I feel so gross
and wet and nasty and not cute oh I'm
gonna go home now shower and then make
myself some food my mom just texted me
saying I got my hello fresh order in so
I'm really excited I'm gonna go home
cook up some yummy meals
I feel so clean and fresh I got a
nosebleed in the shower which has I'm
never gonna nosebleed in my life before
I only know what to do I think I managed
to stop it after I wash my hair I like
to spray it with the way smooth spray it
basically makes my hair really soft and
like a lot easier to brush through when
it's wet so I'm gonna be cooking my hell
up fresh if you've never heard me talk
about I hold fresh before it's basically
a meal subscription company so they
deliver you fresh ingredients to your
doorstep
if you're really busy and always running
around and don't have time to sit down
and plan your meals and go grocery
shopping and come up with like healthy
meal ideas they send you everything you
need to make a meal and they have tons
of food options I don't eat meat so I
choose the vegetarian plan so here I
have myself a garden Casa di which I'm
really excited to make it's super
convenient because it literally gives
you all these cards of the meals that
are included in your package and it has
step-by-step directions on the back like
I'm not the best cook but every time I
make a Hello fresh meal it ends up
tasting super good so if I can do it you
can too and like all the ingredients are
pre measured so you don't even like
do anywhere all you basically have to do
is put them together and I have a coupon
code for you guys
you can enter Haley Sonny 30 on
hellofresh comm to get $30 off your
first week absolutely ten out of ten
deal definitely Herman I actually
already made the red hot tomato soup if
you saw on my snapchat it turned out
amazing
this one looks yummy but I think I'm
gonna be making this one it's a little
bit healthier it takes ten minutes to
prepare and the rest is just cooking
time so this should be easy
I've got all my ingredients and here
just a bunch of veggies Tuesday just mix
them up toss them up
I already made the chipotle mayo with
the chipotle powder and mayo they gave
me and then I also made pico de gallo
with onions beet set aside the cilantro

ended up being able to literally make a
meal for three out of these ingredients

live around my area a lot of people are
Jewish and today's Friday it's Shabbat
and everyone like hangs out with their
families and like has dinner so they
pretty much stay home for most of the
night so it's dead

thought I'd see the opportunity spend
the night just editing tonight doing
it's really ok so I just finished
editing like most of the video it's time

my mother thinks that fluoride is taking
over brains and the government is
putting fluoride in her toothpaste in
order to manipulate and control our
actions so she bought this special type
of toothpaste from Whole Foods that's
fluoride free as if the government would
put something out into the market that
would like make certain people fall
against their whole like manipulative
like plan if you guys ever get cloned
and your will is taken over by
authorities I will be in the right
mindset to come and save you because of
