skateboard feet bling jingle skateboard
feet a bull Jew new intro music take one
please jingle skateboard feet hey ya
made of money until you hear and I'm
joined here today and we're gonna be
filming a workout routine so me and
Haley have been training together and we
just watched show you guys what we've
been doing with our personal trainer
recently because it's been hard work
it's like really hard so we've been
training three times a week and we
actually asked our trainer to record
these for us so it's been interesting we
just put together some moves that we
usually do together since we work out
like at the same time we usually do like
partner workout so it'll be stuff that
you can do alone but you can also like
incorporate a friend into it if you want
to make it more fun you can do all of
these at home you definitely like don't
have to go to a gym you just need a mat
you guys will have been asking me what I
do with my trainer so I just want to let
you guys know spill the beans no one do
it on it and yeah without further ado
let's Burpee into the stage you know so
our trainer makes us go on the
elliptical and we usually do this for 10
to 15 minutes this is a great way to get
your blood pumping but at the same time
I feel like it's a good lower body
workout if you add some resistance so
yeah this is usually when me and Olivia
are catching up on a day see what we've
been up to and once we've got that light
sweat going in we start our workout so
next we do a plank for two minutes
straight which is also a great warm-up
before a workout because you're
essentially using every single muscle in
your body just make sure you squeeze
your abs really tight I never used to
work on my arms before so as you can see
they're really weak so my training is
really trying to get my arms to get a
little bit stronger and he makes us do
these push-ups but I liked
by them and new girl push-ups because I
can't even attempt to do the other ones
and then we go straight into apps so
we're doing beats so we're doing like
Criss crosses going up and down and this
is really good for your lower abs and
just make sure you keep your back on the
ground just to keep your back safe and
you can support it by putting your hands
like in a triangle right under your
tailbone so we'd like to do each
exercise for three sets and then I think
like 30 or 25 reps depending on the move
here we're just doing some regular
sit-ups and the slower you go the more
your abs are engaged so like I try to go
pretty slow and then I also try to not
slam my back on the ground when I'm
going down instead of using momentum try
to actually use your abs to pull you up
these alternating circles literally kill
me and Olivia it's so effective on your
lower abs just give it a try and you'll
know what I'm talking about and the
lower you keep your legs and the slower
you go the more you'll feel it in the
end we met a music baby's father run up
a little bitch
you can suck the meat if you want I have
no clue what these are called but
basically we go up on our hands and then
come down on our elbows and just repeat
it these are so so hard on your
shoulders on your arms on your abs on
your legs like you feel this all around
now let me move down got it stand
stomach much so then we have mountain
climbers and this is like an ab / like /
glute / cardio workout and Brian our
trainer makes us do these for two
minutes straights literally killing us
my legs given so often it's kind of sad
okay good you good you guys you get and
then we have the infamous bicycles and
sometimes we do these slowly and
sometimes we do them really fast it
depends on what kind of effect we're
going for my trainer calls my left leg
or shrimp leg because I have such a hard
time extending it all the way out and
then we have sideways Legolas and these
also kill because a trainer makes us do
them for such a long amount of time
you'll feel the burn in your butt a few
minutes and I promise what I mean no
Pokemon to scar to the region
then we have another partner workout so
we're doing squats but you have to wait
for the other person to go up and down
so you're burning while you're waiting
and you're burning while you're going up
and squeezing your butt you can do these
by yourself I just like looking in the
mirror and waiting for a few seconds I
guess shout out to the guy behind me
just like casually rolling his back and
then we have the weighted leg extension
machine and unfortunately you can't do
this at home because it is a gym machine
we usually have it on 15 pounds and do
like 25 reps and then 25 reps on the
other one and then 10 10 and then like 5
5 and if you look closely you can see my
whole body shaking because these are
also killer finally we have these like
jumps I don't even know what to call
them frog jumps but you just sit in a
squatted position and then jump back and
down without going up and your butt's
gonna be thanking you after this I
promise and instead of using momentum
try to use your glutes and your legs to
lift you up and forward because they
feed you that you're actually gonna
start seeing a change in your lower body
thank you guys so much for watching this
video there's also a video going up on
Olivia's channel and you guys should
also just subscribe to our so you know
like when you're like oh that's the end
of my car</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
