gonna be filming a prompt get ready with
me videos so it's going to be this
makeup look and two dresses that were so
kindly sent to me by David's Bridal if
you don't know what David's Bridal is
their dress company for all sorts of
events birthday parties prom homecoming
even wedding and I have really good
quality dresses for really affordable
prices so I definitely recommend you
check them out and they have tons of
different styles that are in trend so
you'll definitely find something really
cute that you're looking for a
stomatopod making this video I got my
makeup done by a makeup artist this is
crystal hi her friend dry she's so good
at what she does I'll link her Instagram
but I need your guy's help to help me
pick which dress do you think actually
were to prom so the first dress is this
beautiful two-piece and it comes with
the jewel top that has a collar and it
also has a beautiful open back that I
think adds so much to the dress and the
bottom is just black and simple and goes
all the way down
and the second dress is also beautiful
it has mint detailing going all around
and then once you get to the bottom it
flares out like a mermaid dress and this
dress makes me feel like a princess and
I love it so much
they're both equally gorgeous and I'm
kind of stuck so definitely leave a
comment down below telling me which
dress you think looks better on me but
without further ado let them straight
into the makeup look
guys enjoyed it if you did give it a
thumbs up and leave a comment I know you
liked it
check out new bridle with the link down
below thanks so much all the way slow
and that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
