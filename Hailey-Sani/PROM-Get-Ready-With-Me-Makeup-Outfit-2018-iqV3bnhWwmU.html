gonna be filming a prom get ready with
me so basically I did this makeup look
and then I also have a really cute
outfit on and this dress is actually
from David's Bridal which you guys might
have heard of here on YouTube
they actually partnered up with me for
this video and I'm so happy that they
did because I love the dress that I'm
wearing if your prom is coming up and
you're clueless on what to wear
I got you then you have a ton of cute
dresses to choose from all different
trends and styles so you'll definitely
find something that you're looking for
that fits your taste and they're all
pretty affordable you can literally find
a dress for a hundred dollars and if you
use my code which will be linked in the
description box you can get 20 bucks off
any dress that's a hundred dollars or
more and you can also find accessory
shoes a bag basically everything you
need to complete your whole prom look I
just want to quickly mention that before
we hop into the video without further
ado let's jump into the makeup so after
moisturizing and making sure my skin
super soft I'm gonna be going ahead and
concealing my eyelids because I just
want to go ahead and jump into this look
with the eye makeup after the concealer
I'm gonna be applying a little bit of
primer so the eyeshadow last and then
I'm gonna be sticking two little pieces
of tape just to make sure my wing is
very sharp after the eye shadow I'm
gonna be getting this warm toned peachy
brown color and applying this very
briefly on my crease this is gonna be
like the first thing you do to define
your crease kind of to deepen the look
I'm gonna be grabbing this plum color
and applying this slightly beneath where
you just applied the peachy color this
kind of adds a shadowy ombre effect
having this shimmery light pink color
I'm gonna be applying this just on the
middle of my lid I'm gonna be grabbing a
kind of denser pointed brush and mixing
these two slightly darker shimmery plum
colors and applying this on my outer V
for that clean-cut crease your colors
will be a lot more vivid if you slightly
wet your brush before picking up the
eyeshadow so I'm gonna be wetting it
with the setting spray and grabbing the
champagne color and you guys can already
probably see the difference this is
making as you can see the pigmentation
is so much more clear and I applied this
towards the inner half of my lids for
the final reveal you can peel off the
tape and just blend it slightly so it
doesn't look like you here eyeshadow
came out of a machine I use a little bit
of liquid liner to define my lash line
but I didn't wing it next I grab the
soft white color and just put it in my
inner corners to brighten up my eyes and
just to incorporate the bottom lashline
to the look I grabbed this plum color
and just applied it on my lower lash
line moving on I primed the rest of my
face and you guys are kind of gonna see
that this makeup tutorial is kind of out
of order so please bear with me next I
lined my waterline with this black
eyeliner and my tight line just so I can
get a cat eye effect I mixed this
illuminating primer with tinted
moisturizer because I wanted really
really light natural glowy coverage so I
put this all over my face and I blended
it with my Beauty Blender
put your head and I buffed it into my
skin with a stippling brush next up I
want to conceal my under eyes so I'm
using a little bit of concealer to cover
up my dark circles and then again
blending this with my Beauty Blender and
try to be careful because obviously you
don't want to cover up your eyeshadow
with the concealer and once I was done
with the face makeup I just set it all
with the setting powder next up I curled
my lashes as you can see pretty out of
order and then put on my favorite
mascara which is what better than sex
mascara by Too Faced moving on to brows
I just comb them through and then grab
my favorite brow pencil which is the Too
Faced brownie pencil and I like to pull
my eyebrows up and then draw a line and
then just blend it all out with a little
bit more product and finally the brow
brush and then I set my eyebrows with an
eyebrow gel if you draw a line under
your brow line with a highlighter stick
your eyebrows will look so much better
so just make sure you do that to get
clean-cut brows moving on I want to
contour my face so I applied bronzer
under my cheekbones and then blend it
all out with this really poofy blending
brush
I did the same wet your brush trick for
my highlighter so I'm grabbing the fenty
Beauty highlighter and justifying that
onto my cheekbones tip of my nose brow
bones Cupid's bow everywhere I didn't
want my lips to look crusty under the
matte lipstick then I'm gonna be
applying so I just moisturized it using
this nuni lip oil and then I line my
lips as a layout for the lip gloss lip
stains can get messy so I think it's
always best to start off with little and
then add more as you feel the need to
and then I finished off this look with
this glowy peach colored blush on my
cheeks make sure you use setting spray
on prom night because I promise you your
makeups gonna be melting off and this is
the finished look I chose to work with
pink warm toned colors just because I
knew it would match my dress and you
guys gonna see it in a minute
I decided to go for this blush colored
lace dress and of course my shoes are
from David's Bridal as well I think it's
very feminine with a touch of scandalous
the slid down the leg I thought it would
be so cute if I added this jeweled
headpiece to my hair
what it be
and I finished off the look with this
jeweled clutch which was a similar color
to the dress thank you guys so much for
watching this video I would love it if

our study squad I hope I can give you
some kind of inspiration for your prom
look if you end up using my code and

way it's a full loop I'm back bye
