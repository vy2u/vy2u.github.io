and today we're gonna be filming a prom
trends video and I brought in an expert
a celebrity stylist Lindsay Albanese
thank you so much for having me I might
have styled a few people you or your
friends no have you heard of Pretty
Little Liars just maybe a couple time
Bella Thorne Sarah Hyland I've styled a
bunch of people and I'm also a youtuber
and I'm so showing and her channel link
will be down below we filmed a video
with her prom do's and don'ts so if you
want to be rocking on that dance floor
you should probably watch it you have to
watch it you are my model in in my prom
video on our channel so you guys gotta
head over there and then make sure to
subscribe
will you put our link below of course
okay so without further ado let's get
started let's go okay so I just tried on
my first dress and I'm in love so cute
like I don't know it's really pretty I
wanna go to get well she loves it so
much she wants to cry this is one of my
trends which is a prom staple
embellishment and beating so beautiful
so much impact prom night just go for it
on all these all the sequins
oh yes you're never gonna go to prom
again exactly so you got to go for it
and this is what you are doing the one
thing I suggest when you're wearing a
ton of beading you don't need a lot of
jewelry no that's my one big tip let
your face be your best accessory and the
dress shine and that's all you really
need
okay so when I transfer you guys know I
love black first of all let's start off
with that I didn't know that I love
black I think it's safe to say that most
people love wearing black it's Lindo
it's easier when you kind of feel cool
in it okay so when I first tried on this
dress and then looked in the mirror the
cutouts those were the things that hate
my
immediately also it's black and it's
like tighter around the ways fitted it
makes you feel really edgy and like
sassy this is one of the trends that I
love cutouts it shows a little bit of
skin without showing too much because we
don't want to be too scandalous we want
to just be like oh but anyone have a
little sass and we want to have class
sass class yeah and I can go on with the
rhyme but I'll just stop right there it
has just the amount of attitude still
covered up but showing a little and it
looks hot on you yeah so for our third
dress this is a two-piece set and I
personally really like this trend I feel
like it's a new trend like it not a lot
of girls are doing it yet yeah it's not
really unexpected I love two-piece
dresses because it feels yeah just it's
separation of the two pieces you feel so
special I do it's like so cute yeah you
could be the one bringing it to your
school exactly mom and then you have
your own kind of Katy Perry moment if
you have going on here it's a full and
fun I love this because it's it's dressy
because it's a gown but then the two
pieces make it feel a little more casual
makes it also feel more fun yes and I
feel like it would be so much easier to
dance in the biggest tip I have for this
is you don't want to show too much
midriff because then it can just be a
little too risque I would say an inch to
an inch and a half max we don't want to
be showing too much skin we don't want
the principal calling saying what did
your daughter show up in that's a bra
keepin it class yes keep it classy so
that's and we do not want to top to look
like a bra so only about an inch maybe a
little bit more of skin only so the
fourth dress it's really just really
cute it's really like a babydoll dress
like really sweet when you looked in the
mirror like oh this is my really clear
like oh I'm like wait and say it on
camera for this trend this is sheer
accent you can see this is a
floor-length gown but its sheer fabric
so you can see the shorter dress
underneath and I like because you can
see your legs but then you also can't so
it's kind of like a short dress but not
I think number one with this dress not
only is it cute how comfortable is it
it's something that's so important you
can't go to prom in my uncomfortable
it's not worth it like you're gonna be
on the dance floor gonna be dancing all
night with your little day and you don't
want to be like oh my god like I got my
dress and has a nice soft pink so it's
really feminine and pretty I just think
all around you look stunningly beautiful
in this I wish you had five prom dates
so you can wear all these gowns I'd be
like hey Lee oh yeah you doing she's
like I have a lot of dresses to wear so
I need five dates to go are we done
playing dress-up or now but there's more
on Lindsey's titles so the video that we
film on her channel will be linked down
