welcome back to my channel today is my
prom day I have a bunch of my friends
here and we're gonna be getting ready
together for prom it's in four hours we
have a lovely hairstylist and a makeup
artist on the way and we're just getting
ready in my house I'm gonna be showing
you guys a time-lapse of my makeup and
my hair being done and then my dress and
then like prom pictures and like the
whole shebang
today is literally my prom day I'm gonna
be putting this face oil on my face it's
by squalane
I already did my shower routine and
shaved and I used the eos evolution of
smooth sensitive shave cream I've been
using this a lot lately but I especially
want to have like just like feel good in
my body and make sure I'm just like
super smooth it's super moisturizing it
has aloe vera in it there's lavender
butter in it so it's very smoothing on
your skin and I have really sensitive
skin and sometimes certain shaving
products don't really like go with my
body type so I always have to use like
sensitive shaving creams like this one
to avoid getting like bumps and like red
spots all over my body so I just use
this in the shower before I got ready
for prom I also used some tanner so
that's why I look a little bit more
bronzed than I usually do I'm gonna be
starting my makeup soon and then hair
and then outfits so Esther's getting her
hair done right now that's what you're
going for like a messy bun Wow you look
just like that so my makeup was done by
Natalie who's an amazingly talented
makeup artist and you guys should
definitely check her out especially if
you're in the LA area but basically I
wanted to go for a really classy look
because I knew my dress was gonna be
very girly very like princess like and I
wanted my makeup to go with it so I
wanted a light smoky eye with winged
liner for a very feminine look and then
nothing else on the rest of my face so
like no glittery shadows no crazy
lipsticks or anything just some plain
contour highlighter blush and a gloss
thank us for - again why she's like
spank frighten and illuminate you know
whatever she says wait are you gonna
blend it off where the I saw her
speaking speak notice I'll leave it okay
I was scared of course she isn't up
blending it cuz I look like an oompa
loompa and I also had some falsies going
on and I usually never wear fake
eyelashes it was definitely an
experience
I absolutely love the end look I think
the eyeliner and the lashes everything
just looks so good put together look at
the powder on my shirt that's really sad
and then my hair was done by Jordan
who's also a great hair stylist here in
the LA area here's a picture of what I
wanted and my hair to look like and what
we use as a source of inspiron and now
I'm getting my hair done and we're going
for this like really pretty like how
would you describe this hair look that
we're going for mermaid
loose like texture yeah texturizer loose
bun that were you going for I'll film
everything in the end so you guys know
like the end outlook I've never had this
much makeup on well probably like two or
three times in my lifetime my eyelashes
are really like heavy and dramatic you
feel that yeah you don't like makeup you
only having a lot of things I hate
having makeup on but like I like the way
it looks so you're going to deal with
this so I'm gonna do it
I wanted my hair to be up because my
dress had an open back and I knew I
wanted my back like to be visible while
I'm taking pictures and stuff so that's
why we decide to put it up and we
started off by curling my hair so that
it could have some texture in the bun
I personally thought my hair looks so
good the end all thanks to Jordan I
think she did an amazing job she made me
literally look like a real-life Disney
Princess I just wrapped up with hair and
the makeup is also done there's still
like an hour till we go have to take
prom pictures yeah we're like this is
