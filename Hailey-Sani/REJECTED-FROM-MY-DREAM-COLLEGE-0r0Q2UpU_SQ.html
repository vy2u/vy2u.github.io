side really on top of their shed I got
my results back and they denied to me
they rejected me hey guys it's Healy
sunny and today I'm gonna be talking
about a topic that you guys probably
don't see a lot here in the beauty guru
community I'm gonna be talking about
college because as a youtuber I actually
did take my studies very seriously
throughout high school and I actually
did apply to college I got into college
I got rejected from college I was a
completely normal high school student I
went to traditional public high school I
did the normal application process as a
student I just want to share my process
with you guys and I also asked you guys
to ask me questions on Instagram and I'm
gonna be answering all of those and a
lot of you are really curious about the
end results so I'm also going to be
revealing those if you're not a student
in the United States or you're still
pretty young and you don't really know
how the college application process here
works basically around the first
semester of senior year and senior year
is 12th grade so it's like the last year
of high school you start applying to
colleges the second semester you start
getting answers back I'm from California
so we kind of have like two different
types of colleges we can apply to we
have the UC application process which is
the University of California schools so
they're like public schools here in
California and I applied to a couple of
those and then there's also the common
app and common app is generally for
private schools correct me if I'm wrong
I'm literally not a college counselor
I'm a student so I'm currently a senior
and I only have a week of school left
not even like I graduate in four days so
I'm almost there and I did the whole
thing girl I literally went through
every single step so don't worry you're
gonna get answers to all your questions
the first thing I want to share are my
stats and my stats is basically like GPA
and SAT or ect score I took the SAT SAT
has an English portion a math portion
and then an essay portion which is
optional but I had to take the essay
also for like some of the colleges that
required it that I was applying to so I
took that my GPA so my like grade point
average throughout I think they only
take into account your sophomore and
junior year
grades I had a 3.87 unweighted so it's
out of four it's out of a 4.0 if you're
unweighted and I had a three-point 87
but the thing is I don't believe I took
any AP classes sophomore junior year so
I guess my weighted score wasn't that
different I took a couple honors classes
but my grade point average was a
three-point 87 so like basically a 3.9
which it was a pretty good GPA my GPA
was a lot more on the stronger side
compared to like other students
obviously there were like people in my
grade who had like a 4.5 GPA because
they took a million APs and they were
just really on top of their for me
I just preferred to kind of take regular
classes and just do really well in those
senior year I did challenge myself I
took two AP classes AP French class and
an AP calculus and ap basically means
it's a lot it's like college level so
it's a lot more difficult and then at
the end of the year you take this test
if you get a 4 or 5 out of it and it's
graded out of a 5 you get college credit
so you don't have to take that class in
college I recently did take my ApS but I
don't find out my scores till this
summer so I can't really give you
information about that but basically I
did not take ApS all throughout high
school and my situation is kind of
different because I did let's start like
an American public high school my
sophomore year so I was kind of like
still trying to like figure out where I
kind of was on the American level so
that's kind of what happened with me on
the SAT I got a 13 90 which is still
like an okay grade but it definitely was
not as strong as the people I was
competing with going into the colleges
that I applied for so I got a 13 90 it's
great out of the 1,600 on the SAT it
wasn't okay grade but I should have
worked harder I honestly did not study
for the SAT I was just kind of pretty
late like everyone around me was taking
SAT prep courses and I was just doing
YouTube I wasn't really thinking about
the SAT
um I still was like working hard in my
classes so I kind of just went into the
SAT with the knowledge I had gained from
high school I hadn't like done special
SAT training so those are my stats I had
a 3.9 GPA and then 1390 on
I applied to six colleges in total
throughout high school I never really
had a college that I was like head over
heels for that I was like I see myself
here like I want to go here I guess I
should have done my research a little
earlier on because those people who
really were in love with a school I
guess there's goods and bats too it
worked really hard like the fact that
they really wanted to go there and
motivated them to work harder to get
there throughout high school and they
some of them actually did get in but
those people who really were obsessed
with the school and then ended up not
getting in were really hurt at the end
so I was just kind of in the middle like
I was like yeah I'd love to go there but
I never like fell in love with a school
I applied to for UC University of
California blank so there's a bunch I
think there's like 11 of the an ayap I
do see Berkeley UCLA UC San Diego and UC
Santa Barbara UC Berkeley and then UCLA
are definitely more of the more
challenging ones they're all really hard
schools to get him to like I didn't
apply to any schools that were like
safety schools your safety schools
basically you're guaranteed to get into
just because your stats are a lot higher
than their average stats and then your
target schools which are the schools
that it looks like you can probably get
in and then your reach schools are
schools that your stats are a little bit
lower or like their acceptance rate is
pretty low and it's kind of like a reach
to get there so you're supposed to like
apply to these three types of schools I
completely crossed out safety school it
didn't really affect me at the end
because I did get into colleges that I
applied to and then on the common app
the common app is like this completely
different application process that you
use like your essays are different I
applied to to private schools so I
applied to USC which is the University
of Southern California and NYU which is
New York University
obviously NYU kind of was the one school
that I was leaning more towards it was
the only school I applied to that wasn't
in California and towards the end of my
college application process I kind of
realized that that's where I really
really really wanted to go I never
really like became obsessed with it
where it was all I thought about but I
just really saw myself there
I had a lot of trouble seeing myself at
these other schools so for you sees the
application process is you write four
essays and they're kind of like mini
essays and I put a lot of effort into
these essays I worked on them for around
four months just a long amount of time
to write like four essays that are like
two paragraphs or some and yeah I
literally put my heart and soul into
these essays sent them my SAT score my
transcript with my GPA I talked a lot
about like my YouTube and the fact that
if I were to get into college I would be
a first-generation college student and
my family I talked about the fact that I
moved a lot so I just sent my UC
applications and bam I was done with my
you see applications for the common tab
it's a little bit more different on the
common up like I said I was only
applying to USC and NYU so you only send
them one essay which is one long essay
and then sometimes they ask you
questions like why do you want to go to
NYU and you have to like answer like in
a paragraph so I also sent them my
transcript my SAT score and by the end
of December all my applications were out
and I was just in this like Melrose
chillin oh there is no chilling cuz like
they're like okay financial aid
deadlines okay like housing deadlines
and all these deadlines March and April
rolled around and I got my results back
which is the exciting part I get I feel
like you guys are the most excited for
that I was the most excited for that
obviously so I'm gonna go in order of me
receiving each decision and then I'll
get to the last one so like I'll start
off with the first one the first
decision I found out was UCLA and they
denied to me they were like sorry girl
they rejected me they didn't want to go
there I guess which I knew cuz new
feeling was definitely a reach in my
stats were a lot lower than their
average stats that they accept and I
never really was in love with it I mean
it would have been cool to go to UCLA
because it's just such an amazing school
and I would be here in Los Angeles so I
wouldn't have to move um but they
rejected me and then the same day I
think I found out about UC San Diego and
I got accepted there when I was
hey like that's cool it was like my
first college acceptance I was like I
got into a UC so it kind of gave me a
little bit of hope and then I found out
about USC it was actually the funniest
thing I was literally sleeping my mom
comes in and she hands me this letter
and she goes they rejected you at first
I was like I'm dreaming like what the
 and then I got up and it was
actually like my rejection letter I
guess that one was kind of sad I kind of
did want to get accepted there ah they
rejected me also which whatever I got
accepted into UC Santa Barbara a couple
days later I think and I was like whoa
like that's so cool you see Sina
Barbarella
I heard amazing things about that school
like everyone that talks about it just
seems to love it it's not too far from
home and I was like UC Santa Barbara I
got accepted that's good and then NYU I
was really looking forward to I remember
being super anxious super nervous
logging into my portal because you login
into the website and it like tells you
your application status and I logged in
and they were like wait-listed
waitlist basically means we can't accept
you right now but if some of the people
that we did accept decide not to go here
and there's extra space available we'll
let you come in that's what we get list
me so you're kind of like they're Plan B
I had positive vibes I was very like wow
this is better than a rejection it's not
good as being accepted but I wasn't sad
or happy I was just kind of like okay
the last date to find out about
weightless is August first so there is
still okay I guess this is like a
spoiler alert I haven't heard back from
them so I'm still on their waitlist but
they did put out this update a few days
ago being like we accepted most of the
people that we are going to be accepting
off the waitlist already so it looks
like we're not gonna be accepting any
more people into the fall semester here
at NYU and I was like dad but they're
like but we still might be accepting a
few more people into our spring semester
stay tuned we're gonna be calling a few
people off the list throughout the
summer for me it was very like okay I
don't think NYU's happening hopes
shattered and then finally UC Berkeley
came out they didn't accept me didn't
want to go there anyway I don't know why
I applied I
they have the highest dropout rate in
California so yeah I wasn't trying to do
that so that left me with UC San Diego
and UC Santa Barbara I kind of like
already knew I really was leaning more
towards UC Santa Barbara just cuz
usually San Diego was a little bit
farther than home like I knew as a it's
they're both amazing schools UC Santa
Barbara is a major party school
it's voted like the happiest College in
California it's literally on the beach I
went I visited it was really pretty but
when I visited I didn't get that gut
feeling where I was like wow I belong
here and I visited the dorms and I was
like whoa like I I never really like put
college life into my hand applying
didn't make me realize that wow this is
gonna be my reality if I actually do get
accepted it was kind of like a dream
almost once I got accepted they were
like okay your decision is due by May
1st you either have to commit or you
have to be like I'm not going there I
ended up committing so I sent in my
statement of intent to register
I found a roommate to stay in in a dorm
so that's where I'm at right now right
now it looks like I might be going to UC
Santa Barbara unless in the summer I get
this like ultimate change of heart or
like NYU accepts me whatever the case
may be and I decide not to go there I
don't know if I actually do want to go
there for all four years I don't know if
I want to go there at all just because
it's a very very small town and I've
always been raised in the city so I've
always been in like really really big
cities my job also it just I don't know
I still don't know I'm still trying to
figure that out
but that's where I am right now I always
have my plan B which is Community
College here in Los Angeles Santa Monica
Community College is awesome if you're
kind of like in my situation or if you
feel like your stats aren't good enough
for any of the colleges that you do want
to go to it just gives you like an extra
year or two to take more classes get
more credits and then apply to college
as a sophomore a junior can always do
that a lot of my friends are doing that
like me if you didn't get into a school
you really wanted to go to in my case
NYU I could always go take classes there
for a year and then transfer because
getting
accepted into college as a transfer
student is a lot easier than just coming
out of high school and going in as a
freshman they're a lot more selective
with their freshmen acceptances now I'm
gonna be going into some of the
questions that you guys ask me Laura and
asked what do you want to major in
obviously depends based on the college
but for me it was mostly communications
I truly wanted to do business but I just
freakin I'm done with math like I'm so
done with math I really want to go to
NYU because they have communications
media culture which is just perfect
gaining a lot of information about what
I'm already doing are you going to do
any online school if I do end up wanting
to go to like SMC like I already picked
my classes there just as like a backup
if I do end up going there I don't want
to be stuck with shitty classes so I am
gonna be doing a few online classes so
that means I do some on campus some
online and save time what was the
hardest year of high school for you
honestly it's freaking senior year it's
a myth everybody always want me senior
year as a blast like it's so easy
everyone so chill honey I guess it was
my fault for taking like to AP's AP
Calculus cannot even imagine going back
like i'm so glad it's over
worst time of my life it was supposed to
be junior year apparently but for me
senior year was so hard just because I
had to like they don't gave you free
time to apply to college you're freaking
have to do your work and then come home
and work on your college admissions like
it's it was such a struggle for me were
you involved in any school clubs
organizations no and this was a mistake
because even though I had a lot of
extracurriculars here like based around
YouTube like the campaign's I did the
work I did I never really like was a
part of school organizations which I
should have been it would have shown
that I had things going for me in every
area do my school work do good at school
work come home do my YouTube do good at
YouTube I feel like I should have
branched out like there's some sports
there like volunteering had a little
club going on I just didn't have time
how did you know what schools to apply
to interesting question for me I kind of
like eliminated like geographically
where I want it to be I read
I either wanted to be in LA or New York
I guess like in California or New York I
regret so many things I can't tell you
enough how important it is to do
research like I wish I applied to other
colleges in New York City I wish I did
early decision early decisions basically
when you apply you only get to apply
early to one school and it basically
shows you really really want to go there
and I didn't do early decision for any
schools I feel like if I had done that
for maybe like NYU it would have hired
my chances of getting in there when
college counselors come to your school
from different colleges go to their
freaking meeting they should have gone
to so many more than I did yeah I wish I
applied to more colleges what are you
most excited for in college it's crazy
because I still like I can't be like oh
going here and I heard this is really
good here if I do go to Santa Barbara I
like I'm so excited to like be by the
beach and people that are really fun
like partying all the time but at the
same time like everyone's really good at
school so it's like this really good
balance if I do want to say in a
background what I'm excited about is
just being independent for the first
time in my life I've always had a really
close bond with my family and not having
that and like being my own mom and dad
that's gonna be so crazy for me like
staying in a dorm doing like college
student things would be really fun if I
go to like Community College I get out
of school at like 10:30 which is so
early I'd have so much more free time to
focus on YouTube to do other things I
wanted so there's pros to like both side
wherever I do end up going what classes
do you recommend taking throughout the
years if you want to look academically
like really strong I definitely
recommend you take some APs and honors
classes especially like in your younger
years of high school just take a couple
honors classes because they're literally
GPA boosters take a bunch of like random
easy classes that can just like boost
your GPA but at the same time take like
challenging classes that make you look
like a strong candidate for school don't
go overboard where you're drowning under
work if you get a C in AP class it does
not look good you'd rather go to take
the regular version of that class and
get an A
what I'm saying take as many classes as
you think you can handle and do well in
that's the end of my video it's kind of
a long video but if you have any other
questions about college or anything I'd
be more than happy to answer them in the
college section in the college section
in the comment section I don't think I
would have even been able to get into
college if it wasn't for my friend Sarah
who literally guided me throughout the
whole process because she like is
obsessed with the idea of college it's
really cute and she was my friend and
helped me out with almost everything and
showed me like how to apply I was
literally clueless like I was a little
baby I was like how do you like college
and she took me out throughout the whole
process
I definitely comment and I'll be there
for you and if I don't know the answer
for something I'll ask her and she'll
know the answer for it and yeah I love
you guys so much all the way to put it
out and back
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
