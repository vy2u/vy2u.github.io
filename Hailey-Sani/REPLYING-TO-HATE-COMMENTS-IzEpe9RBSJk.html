thought I'd be filming a reacting to
hate comments video well not actually
react because I picked the comments out
but they were really funny so I thought
I'd share them with you how to reply
back to them so I guess this is a
replying take comments video anyways I'm
filming outside today and sorry if
there's like the sound of the waves
crashing no sorry not sorry because like
when do you actually hear waves crashing
in videos like never so you're welcome
before I move I thought I'd fill the
video here some of these are like for
really old videos too so these are going
to be extra interesting because even
when I watched those videos
I started hating on them marah's sorta
said oMG I don't like hailey she's rude
as to all the little kids I'm a mom of
21 so everybody back off unless you're
like a very early teen mom I just I
can't take this con seriously if I had a
dollar for every time someone spelled my
name wrong I'd be on vacation with Bill
Gates doesn't like me um so like
apparently I'm rude maybe I am oh forget
Benjamin said Haley is dumb you're dumb
for not being able spelling Nate
Jolin W said Haley is right and 132
people thumbs up so I'm like what but
hey she's a directioner so I'm gonna
back off I got this comment on my accent
challenge that I did with Emily Luke
Smith's said Jesus the Haley's are
bearing to Bridget she is so bloody
idiotic
how am i embarrassing to Britain I
wasn't even representing Britain in that
video for God's sake I'm an American
accent Brandon or tis said someone do
her account 27 people agree Brandon how
about you consider changing your icon
because like you're literally making
love to impact Cheetos
Nathan Jarvan said I'm just going on a
bitch of American versus British videos
and yours is by far the most disturbing
I have seen sure oh I did watch that vo
again myself and like I was so damn
stupid
I'm not going to like fight back because
I agree with you
goals paradise said her eyes look blue
she might be a colorblind one so this is
something that I want to share with you
for a very long time because my eyes are
blue color blind so I'm sorry the Mexi
cushion er said on an accent videos free
but have to stop and ask how Haley
doesn't know some of the words listed
but just I still can't pronounce the
word Pekin
peeking is she really American the
language that spoken in my household is
not English except for like me and my
sister and I was not raised in an
American household so it's pretty normal
for me not to know some things and like
not to know how to pronounce some things
it's normal I was in born American so
mark David said I am gonna throw up you
know when you eat too much cake and like
you'll love the cake but you just eat
too much and you just want to throw up
not because you hate the cake just
because you've had too much maybe that's
the problem with you maybe you should
get off my channel for a little bit and
then you'll feel better and then you can
continue watching my videos anytime you
want him low bay oh I forgot said I am
trying so like she's trying to go up as
well and I like some kinda Z's why is it
pretty don't know Debbie said you sound
exactly like Hayley on YouTube oMG this
is not a me comment but it was just a
really funny comment so I want to put it
in here I'm pretty sure I wasn't like
hosting a radio show so I don't know
we're just girls coming from Alina whom
are said not being mean but she thinks
she's too big I'm honey I don't think it
I know it I'm huge look at me I'm like
the size of Australia not even Australia
I'm like Africa baby I'm huge
Dre says Jesus Christ you're annoying us
I'm sorry maybe you shouldn't be
spending your time commenting on my
videos and spend more time exiting you
know I'm running out of battery I'm
gonna die Sarah
Bing ham said really so Rocha British
people that's being racist
I hope that when she grows that she sees
this video and is ashamed of herself for
the way she treats her friends but the
fact that I'm rude to British people
what I was rude to push people I would
not be best friends anymore
oh this girl I like hers Alex Garcia
said how do you read to British people
that's her best friend and if
not a problem with it neither should you
girl your tenant Jeff love you and then
she said Wow there's also a thing called
shutting up
you just seriously try it like now um
like you try it
Sarah Bing ham I got this comment on
like a healthy lifestyle video and Jack
cuts said she looks like she's always
been super skinny not really achieving
anything are you something needs to be
said about this when like a former
overweight person walks into a room and
they're like oh I work japonais super
healthy for like three months and I lost
like 40 pounds everybody's like well
congratulations but when like that
skinny person says I've been working out
and eating healthy for like three months
and now I'm super fit and confident in
my body they're like shut up
you've been skinny like it's not the
same thing guys there's a difference
between being skinny and being fit to be
honest being fit is the chief some
things so Jack cuts through your
push-ups and stop talking Dan and gozman
said if you were born in the USA your
parents wouldn't name you at Indian
named Lowell or Native American low my
name is Haley
so like apparently Haley
you name now and I never claimed I was
born in the USA anyway Harry should wiki
say you're a ho for only 14
what would stand to say parish cookie
and then a month later she said sorry I
guess it was around Christmastime and
she just wanted to make it to the nice
list this is my favorite comment from
from the whole video
Gaby Miller said you look like you smell
like beef please comment down below what
makes me look like I smell like beef is
it my hair is it my hair does my hair
make me look like oh by the way I look
orange because there's like a really
nice sunset going on but the camera's
not picking up but it's very few very
instagram-worthy I shot all a Nazi said
they are both ugly and she was referring
to me and my sister you might think I'm
ugly we're just totally fine but that
does not mean you should say to their
face like I'm a human too like when you
guys comment something like this you're
not like commenting it towards a robot
like just because I'm talking to a
camera and not like real-life people it
doesn't mean that I don't see what you
guys type I definitely see them so we're
like that's the point I really care I
don't really like care about like the me
comments like as you can see this video
was like a total joke
I don't like it offended by any of these
things and the reason for that is
because while I was like searching for
like funny hey comments through all my
comments in my videos I saw that nearly
like 99% of them were actually like
really supportive and nice ones and I
just want thank you for that like being
there and supporting me because when
there's like nice comments like these
comments don't even matter to me they
feel like I'll be also much all the way
to Pluto bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
