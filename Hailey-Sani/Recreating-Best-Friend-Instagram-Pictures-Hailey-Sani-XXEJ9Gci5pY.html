here today with my youtube mega best
agency my name is olivier the whole
trend of like recreating instagram
pictures has been going around youtube
and we thought we just want to like be
basic basic kind of - not original and
copy other people's ideas I do that
today but we thought it'd be really cute
to do like recreating best friend's
pictures because we've seen a lot of
couple ones and we're not jumping for
those anyway I know it's like
misconception all the time but yeah we
thought it'd be fun to do best friend's
ones and like find cute Tumblr best
friend pictures to recreate we also got
wat footage of us like behind the scenes
yeah trying to get the shot and her
friend Amanda isn't a meal referral Wow
well also like her in the downbar Jitsu
guys can check her out we did three
pictures on my channel and three
pictures on Olivia's channel so I'll
also link her video in the description
box so you guys can go ahead and watch
that after this and with that further
ado let's go ahead and get started with
the first one so this is the first
picture it's this picture of Bella Hadid
and Kendall Jenner and it kind of looks
like it's on like a tour bus we could
only get what the background was so good
I was like literally a black plane
curtain current so I'll insert it some
clips so it's trying to get the shot
roll it actually house on like a white
scrunchie mine silver kendall has on
like a blue striped but no you're
holding you have your arm over the
pillow kind of me
we're like literally covering up half of
Olivia's body so Olivia yeah
close and comfortable your arm is under
the pillow
Olivia solo over but Olivia your arm
needs to be like all the way at the
front of the pillow pillow pillow pillow
pillow hello who cares okay ready
there's some cute heads closer besides
the background the shirts are a little
different like in the original Bella has
riding on her sleeves and the sleeves
that I was wearing like Kendall was
writing is different stripes but I think
you're pretty close okay outfit-wise
we can't get the same
today that would be spending hell money
but like we got pretty good dude
yeah I this is how scary howl like
similar we look I think it's like we
didn't we didn't smile I think we did
pretty it so this like quite a few photo
ID photos your goodbye your man is help
we literally managed together perfectly
well it really looks exact time inhaling
looks exactly like that scary I think I
think you look pretty close the only
thing is your smile I really when I have
to smile like with my teeth in pictures
why it's not just like a candid laughing
one I just get really married um I like
kind of look is genuinely happy and
you're kind of like no it looks this
looks pretty accurate yeah I'm not I
would give this a night guys okay no I
think it's pretty good I think this is
one of our strongest recreation yeah
Olivia I love it hell yeah yeah
okay this picture is one of Kendall and
Kylie and they are at earth cafe and you
can kind of just help because like does
the utensil utensils and like the number
and everything but Kendall's holding
like a coffee cup and Kylie just has
like a spoon on her nose and she's like
looking away and it's black and white
and just like iconic and I think you did
earth is right there so we're gonna be
walking over there
we're gonna be trying to recreate this
picture which was actually also taken at
Earth
we got some great Wow actually spot-on
okay we did have her number while we
were taking the picture yeah but I guess
you can't see it on the show other than
that my hair is kind of off like my hair
looks slightly different but you look
crazy insane
except for my hair the only thing with
my hair is like her hair was flipped
yeah other side like this and I keep
mine on like this side or something so
that was the only thing different but
like I think we did really good with
like getting the press thing and like
the cup with the straw and the spoon
like you look like the angle is like
perfect on you exactly we did a really
good job I really like this okay so in
this picture they're basically out like
it looks like the junk I love like a
7-eleven or they're just like two best
friends sitting on the floor eating
their chips yeah like Pringles and that
bag of like other off-brand
I like Rhys I googled where this was
taken this was in Europe because I
googled the chip brand and they only
sell it in Europe oh my god you're
literally Sherlock are you crazy
a little bit so we're going down into
the place where we can take this picture
we're gonna find some cute so we have
the purple kind because that's the one
key full-length and then we don't have
that deep tracked chip so this is where
other hand doing
I feel her leg positioning could have
been a little bit better yeah and my
pants were not like completely exact to
what she was wearing and she's blonde in
the picture yeah but overall I get such
a cute pic you're like I think I can
picture yeah I like it when you read it

half eight you're like a six and a half
seven six and a half you drop that
