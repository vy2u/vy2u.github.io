way why hey so I'm joined here today
with no hello and she's meant to stir
you guys already know her and you guys
always ask me to film more videos with
her we're like really similar like
looking but I'd say our styles are a
little bit more different I'm more like
an edgy and you're more of like a you're
like boyish and sometimes you're really
like super girly I want a boy no
sometimes I'm like wait who's that boy
in my house and then I'll be like oh
that's no I think it's also because I
have bad eyesight though so we decided
to do a style swap video so sister's
style swap I'm going to be dressing
Hayley and she's gonna be dressing at me
so basically I picked an outfit that's
totally my style and Neil's gonna be
trying that on and I picked an outfit
from my closet that Hayley's gonna be
trying on that's how swap work so we
already picked the outfits but we don't
really know what we're gonna be dressing
up as so now it's gonna be heading out
of the room I'm gonna show you guys
really quick what I picked out for her
we're gonna do it safe for her and then
we're gonna be showing you guys the try
on final outfit let's get started
basically we're gonna be creating a mini
Hayley even though it's basically a mini
Hayley she's gonna be more of a mini
Hayley because she's gonna be wearing
what I would usually wear I describe my
style as like casual edgy girly wow
there's a better way if I could describe
my style in one word I think I'd like
use the word cool and now I'm not trying
to be like yeah like I'm super cool no
like I feel like my outfits always have
to reflect off this like edgy but chic
vibe so that's what I try to go with
this look you guys know I'm really big
on sweaters especially cool sweaters so
here this is like a dark green sweater
it could have been a basic green sweater
but then you got these flaps going all
the way down the sleeve
and they're hella cool they're
obnoxiously long and I think it adds
like a really cool vibe to the sweater
it's not just like a boring sweater for
jeans I picked out these like coated
leather looking jeans because these are
definitely my style I wear them so often
I feel like I like basic items with a
twist so these are like basic black
jeans but they're like coated leather
first shoes I have my dog Martin these
are definitely making a combat I call
him back I was gonna say come back call
it that you see what I did there I don't
do that I think these are making the
edg's come back every these are
definitely the new transfer winter and
Neil's gonna be rocking these too I
don't know if they're gonna fit her I
mean I think we have the same shoe size
but these are just like big looking
shoes you know what I mean I have my
little Gucci purse this is my baby like
I'm giving it to you now take care of
her she's beautiful I'm a sucker for
color coordination like it just makes my
life and makes my day of course I had to
have my sunnies these are my babies
I wear these sunglasses pretty much all
the time I'm never not wearing these
sunglasses
and then finally I'm gonna be bedazzling
her with all the accessories that I wear
pretty much on a daily basis hey a day
and now let's get into her mystery
outfit for me especially since that's
fall something I love doing is a
layering shirts on top of shirt I picked
out this black turtleneck that's a
really soft and then on top I layered it
with a harley-davidson sureties pink
wide cut jeans that I got from Topshop
that I'm obsessed with
I highly doubt Haley would wear this in
a million years so I'm really excited
for her to wear something that she
wouldn't wear I also have an obsession
with a belt so I picked out this black
belt with silver studs that she's going
to wear with the pants and I also picked
out a few rings I love wearing rings
because they spice up your outfit I know
that she's not that big of a ring person
but I am so this is kind of interesting
and then for these shoes I picked out
these black booties I think these are
really cute they would go with the
outfit so let's bring Haley in here and
let's dress her out
I literally look like I'm not I would so
wear these earrings with this outfit but
Nell doesn't have her ears pierced how
are you a girl
so what do you think this is definitely
Haley I don't think I would wear this
but I mean it's a cute outfit I really
like it
what's your favorite thing about it my
favorite thing about it is that he
straps are really long and I like how
they go down to my feet because it makes
the whole outfit seem interesting
exactly what I said okay
so what do you think of the outfit I
picked for you it's very you a very not
me I literally don't know if I'd ever
wear this outfit ever I mean I'm not
saying it's like a bad outfit I just
don't know if it's like an outfit that's
fit for me I mean I feel different so if
I guess that's something what's your
favorite thing about this outfit I
really like the shoes the shoes I would
definitely wear with a very different
outfit I feel like I wear every piece
like I like every single piece I just
don't like the combination of them but
like separately
I like everything I'm wearing why are
