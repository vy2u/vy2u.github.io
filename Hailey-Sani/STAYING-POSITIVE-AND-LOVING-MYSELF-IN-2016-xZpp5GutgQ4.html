to make this quick video about all the
resolutions on my goals for the new year
and I have never been this excited about
a new year before because in the new
year I want to improve myself as much as
I possibly can I want to create great
motivational content for you guys let's
see how it goes so my most important
resolution and I feel like it should
also be your most important resolution
is to overall be a much happier and
positive person and I want to train my
mind into finding the optimistic
viewpoint in a negative situation I just
don't even want to be a negative
situation and in order for me to do that
I need to put myself in a more positive
environment that means removing all
unnecessary and negative people from my
life anyone that makes me feel bad about
myself or self-conscious you're staying
in 2015
see ya or hopefully don't see ya so my
second resolution is to hit a million
subscribers and I know it's crazy and I
know 1 million is a really big number
maybe some of you were thinking Hayley
you're only at 200,000 be realistic you
can't do that first of all if your thing
not even leave and remove yourself from
my channel because I don't need any
negative people in my life I just talked
about this but I read this quote that
was like if you aim for the moon even if
you don't make it you'll land on the
Stars so can we make it happen
I don't know but with your support I'm
pretty sure we can do anything so my
third resolution is to be happy in my
body and this doesn't mean that I
necessarily want to achieve this look
that society has created in our minds
instead I want to learn to be happy in
the body that I do have but at the same
time I want to progress I want to like
work on my body become the fittest and
strongest I've ever been in my life and
just be in peace with my physical
appearance my 4th resolution is to go
vegetarian I want to stay
away from animal products as much as I
can and just have a plant-based diet
because it's the best way to go I know
it's just that sometimes I have my ups
and downs especially with my parents but
we'll see how with goals and I don't
even remember the last time I had meat
so I'm guessing that's a good start my
fifth resolution I don't know I always
suck at counting I want to create my own
merch and I already have some things
planned I have you know some ideas going
around in my head but I'm definitely
gonna be creating unmerge I'm so excited
you guys should be excited too a little
hint would be it's going to be Fitness
related so let me know in the comments
if you would purchase my merch if I
created one my sixth resolution is to
upload a video to my watching every
single day shoutout to Stella Raye for
inspiring me because she is literally
the daily upload Queen she uploads two
videos to two different channels every
day they don't necessarily have to be
like vlogs where I'm just like showing
you what I do every day because my life
can get pretty boring during the school
time but even if it's just like 10 20
seconds of me like talking to the camera
about like something that happened that
day that I want to share with you guys I
want to upload it not like amazing
quality content but content that I feel
worthy of sharing I don't even know what
number this is but I just want to meet a
bunch of new people because I am in a
new place I wanted me as many people as
I possibly can and I want to create
closer bonds with people that I see as
my friends just want to like be there
obsessive best frien I'm kidding but
people that belong in your life will
stay in your life so I don't want like
force any friendships instead I just
want to like see where it goes from here
my next resolution is to go to a bunch
of YouTube events and I know a couple
that I'm going to I'm going to
generation Beauty hopefully and VidCon
2016 I'm so excited because I've never
really liked how to meet up and I would
love to meet you guys
oh my god I would probably fall and cry
and like be obsessed with you and like
take a bunch of selfies oh my god we
went out the best time I would like go
get food and like walk at the park and
it would be you ten at ten and my final
resolution is to learn to be my own best
and the past years I've always been
afraid of being alone and not having
that many friends and like always going
to new plays always having to like adapt
to a new environment because we kept on
moving and I would like go into
depression be like oh my god I hate my
life but I want to learn that being
alone doesn't necessarily mean being
lonely you can be your own best friend I
keep going back to everything Stella
Raye talks about because I've been
watching her videos a lot and I love the
message she's spreading all the her
channel down below but she's your own
best friend and she looks like the
happiest person on earth so if you can
learn to be your own best friend then I
feel like you'll be the happiest you've
ever been and I want to do that so many
positive vibes guys I'm like I can like
sense it I'm so happy right now
365 days later Haley if you're watching
this even if you didn't achieve all
these things I know that you achieved
some of these things and I'm so proud of
you you do you you are gonna be great
it's okay if you lost some people that
you started off the year with it's just
the universe telling you that you have
to go your separate ways so yeah that's
it for this video guys oh my god I'm so
excited let me know your new year's
resolutions in the comments down below
and I love you all so much all the way
to boot up and back
