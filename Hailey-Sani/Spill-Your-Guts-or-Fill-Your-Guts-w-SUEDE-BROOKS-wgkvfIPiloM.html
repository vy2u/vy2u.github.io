we're so we're so close I mean not as
close to be used to be there was just

like somewhat strong what like me and my

her so much credit for like what she did
for my career and like what that's
that's like she did because she's like

honestly think the one that I least
enjoyed like being on set that the final
product of what came out of what it was
was amazing and like everything around
it was amazing but just the process of
like flying in like the team and
everything was definitely chapstick so I
like so I did this like campaign yeah
you were on my was like joke so right I
was like the face of the dual with dual
ended chopsticks and they flew me to
Virginia and I had to like go to the
Walmart headquarters and I'm like walk
into this place and they're like there's
like a bunch of tables and they're like
taking they're like taking pictures for
the Thanksgiving pictures are in Walmart
so they have like all this turkey and
like all this stuff like all these food
decorators and things and I had to be on
set for like 14 hours for two days and
like it was for a chapstick business and
the the like the the thing ends up being
like five seconds songs but like the pea
plants that were very like on me and my
manager and I was just like catch a damn
break so I think chapstick I really just
went on that one but wow you were so old
final product the final product yeah the
thing in Walmart was very humbling and
cool but like everything they went
behind it I don't know there was like
something off and like weird about it I

whatever there was no drama I still see
her and her brother almost like at least
once a week I mean I'm with her I fight
