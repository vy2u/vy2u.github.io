hey guys this Neely sunny and today I'm
going to be filming a back to school
study hacks video and this one I'm
pretty confident in because I picked out
some life hacks that you've probably not
heard of before some of these I didn't
know before and I guarantee you that
after you watch this video you're Greg
will go one grade letter up like I'm
100% confident in that so yeah I'm
really excited um let's get started
number one is a personal tip for me
because it's the chip that helps me the
most it's the reason I have straight A's
it's the reason I like to think my life
is somewhat put together and it is an
agenda this is my agenda it's my right
hand it's my go-to I actually designed
it myself on a website called personal
painter comm and I really like how it
turned out because I'm a sucker for
motivational quotes and this one says
big dreams good music and expensive
tastes
which is literally me and then the
background is a picture of the New York
City skyline which is like my goal it's
my ambition one day to move out there
and work my favorite part is the inside
where it says create like a God command
like a king and work like a slave but I
have the reason I feel like having a
planner earn agenda is really important
is because if you have a bunch of things
that you know you have to do you'll be
swimming in your head all day long if
you're constantly trying to remember
what to do you really won't get around
to doing what you have to do when you
write something down that you know you
have to do it's kind of like a push to
getting closer to doing that thing I
like this one a lot because besides
having every single day on there in the
bottom you have like a chart of workouts
because you guys know I work out and I
have a chart of all the exam slash
quizzes tests I'm gonna be taking that
week so I know when to study for those
I'll leave personal planner comm they
have a bunch of different types of
agendas and personally I feel like if
you customize it and it's like your own
thing then it'll be special to you that
way the things that you write in it will
mean something to you now moving on to
actual unique interesting hats that you
probably don't know about I'm going to
be starting off with getting good grades
on essays
as if you're in high school it's a big
struggle in your life and to get a good
grade on that essay type in your
lectures or your professors or your
teachers name on to Google along with
the subject of the essay that they
assign for you chances are they already
have an opinion on that topic and
they've already written an essay about
it and when you type it into Google it
will probably pop up so you can read
their essay and kind of align yours to
there so it kind of fits the way they
think there's a higher chance of them
giving you a better grade number two if
you're a huge procrastinator and you
write essays like the night before
literally seven hours before it's due
and it's 4:00 a.m. and you're in the
dark on your laptop like trying to type
in something and your eyes get really
sleepy and after hours of staring at
your essay on pages or word your eyes
get kind of tired I have a tip so what
you do is you change the color of the
page like the actual page you're typing
your essay on into this light green
color and apparently scientifically this
color is a little easier on your eyes
instead of like a bright white to change
the color of your page you just go on to
the page Layout tab and you'll find that
color moving on to another category
which is memorizing things girl if
you're like me and you cannot memorize
to save your life listen up I discovered
this tip like last year I remember my
French teacher gave us like a
conversation like an oral presentation
that we had to memorize and perform in
from the class and it was like 30
sentences and I just I was like how am I
supposed to memorize 30 French sentences
like I can't even read off of a paper in
French and you want me to memorize this
but I just did it anyway and I just kept
reading it over and over again writing
it and reading it that was the last
thing I did before going to bed just
kept reading it and reading it I didn't
do anything else and when I was going to
bed honestly I wasn't even confident
myself I was like okay like I've been
doing this for like two hours I still
haven't memorized it I don't know what
I'm gonna do tomorrow but I'm tired so
I'm just gonna like I was just like
ethic like I'm gonna go to bed so I
literally went to bed and I woke up the
next day knowing everything like I knew
all the thirty sentences by heart and it
was weird cuz I didn't before going to
bed and I kind of googled it and I found
out that your brain strengthens new
memories during sleep if you need a
memory same thing
just make sure that the last thing you
do before going to bed is reading that
thing and don't do anything else it
helps at least for me usually when I'm
studying with friends we kind of like to
joke around while we're trying to study
like inside jokes form out of the things
that we're studying and then during the
test I'll remember that inside joke I'll
be like yo like I remember Napoleon like
he was the short one ha ha I don't like
write that down but if you're trying to
memorize like States or presidents or
something in Cronulla khurana wanna
chronological order there is most likely
a song about it on YouTube I kid you not
last week I had a presidents quiz and I
literally wrote president song on
YouTube and the song Pop job it was two
minutes long and it was the only thing I
listened to for the whole weekend during
the quiz I sang it to myself and I got
all them right I got a hundred percent
on the quiz so yeah search it up make a
song out of it it'll help
another thing about memorizing something
is instead of reading the thing that you
need to memorize over and over again try
to write it down because it's actually
proven now writing something out is 13
times more effective than reading that
thing out so those are my study tips I
hope I could help you I really do hope I
could help you because these are
different facts I hadn't heard of them
before
good luck guys I love you so much all
the way to Prudhoe and back bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
