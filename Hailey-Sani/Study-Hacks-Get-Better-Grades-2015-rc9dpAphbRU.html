website called wrestling calm and I'll
link it down below and swell fans from
night so my first study hack is actually
an app slash website called Quizlet and
i use this all the time to like memorize
new vocabulary words and my teachers
actually make these for us but if
there's a specific topic you're learning
in class you can like search for
flashcards and you'll probably find
other people's decks and just keep on
studying they have like games they have
like different learning techniques so
it's really fun and well actually it's
not really fun but it helps
so for this hack you'll need a cup a
piece of paper some colorful pens and
scissors so just cut your piece of paper
into little rectangles once you've done
that write down all the things that are
due this could be a homework projects
essays anything that you have to get
done but I also recommend you do is
write down some rewards like watch
YouTube for 10 minutes or watch a TV
episode or grab a snack and little
things like that next you're going to
fold the piece of paper a few times you
call the target children and now you can
put all the piece of paper into the cup
when it's time for studying grab your
cup and one by one do all the things
that you pick up from the cup and this
actually makes the whole process of
studying a little more bearable because
you have little things to look forward
to so that's why I really think should
add in a few rewards in there
this is only Jesus
this is chosen so I use this hack all
the time so whatever it is that you have
to learn for like an exam just write
down with questions and like little
exercises on pieces of paper
don't believe me just watch so I take
these onto my room's door it actually
some tact to stick a pin on the door as
well and this way every time I want to
enter into my room I have like solve one
of these and later on when you want to
enter your room you have to solve one of
the exercises though this is a great way
to learn stuff in an amazing hack I
actually saw this one on tumblr but if
you have to like read a certain passage
in a textbook just put a little piece of
chocolate or gummy worms or whatever
treat you would like and every time you
get to a point where you're done with
our paragraph you just get your little
reward so in this case mine were Oreo
Milk of chocolate
so if you have to learn to memorize
something this hack is perfect
open voice memos on your phone and react
lab the things you have to learn and
record yourself now click on master
setup I count on to clip a little peace
deal let's a couple n-fab you can open
it thumbs up for my crappy French but
anyway once you're done just save it
onto your phone and then grab your
headphones and just listen to yourself
and this is a great way to memorize
something or just learn something in
general and it's better to do this at
night because night studying is actually
more effective than any other time of
the day
the last hack is my favorite way to
study and basically I like to pretend
I'm a teacher and you can either teach
two imaginary students or in my case you
can force your sister and her friends to
listen to whatever you're teaching
that's it for this video guys I hope you
enjoyed my studying hacks and thumbs up
this video if you want to see similar
videos in the future and I love you all
to Pluto and back wait I just I messed
up my outro what in what what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
