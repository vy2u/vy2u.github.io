crazy hmm that's crusty so basically we
want to show you guys that you can go to
Goodwill and find cute pieces and put
them together with no you already have
in your closet and make really Instagram
Potter the last outfit doesn't even cost
that much money no it doesn't it costed
it was under $40 for both of us make
sure you follow Hannah she's really cute
so you can follow her by clicking this
right here and I'm also gonna be adding
her channel link down below and without
further did anyone for the talking when
you got it you know make it harder baby
girl gone I did you just won't get
famous
from the star look at us thrifting on
the trip it was a joke piss off wait
that's come to gasoline in focus and we
need to find our outfits this is my app
it's obviously gonna be better than
Hannah no I'm gonna win I think adage
isn't a challenge but I think I'm gonna
win
actually I'm making it a challenge how
keen currently in the shoes
here's my basket with all my stuff in it
here's Hannah's or just waiting to try
them on one by six thing can did thank
you have a good day three out oh my god
lighting the rolls
got our goodwill we're going home pop it
into what I got from Goodwill it's like
six or seven things and it was like $33
crazy so the first thing I got was this
great NYU hoodie and what I plan on
doing is like cropping this really
really low because I really like
everything cropped yeah incorrect
I already have like an outfit idea with
something else I got in here so that's
the first thing I got so the next thing
I got was just really sheer black blouse
and it's like kind of shiny I just plan
on like tying this up having an open
neck a bunch of jewels you know it's a
vibe it's cute keep watching if you want
to see how I wear these pieces so this
is like this light pink blouse what I
plan on doing with this is again
cropping it so like a cropped pink your
house you guys are gonna see how cute
this is gonna look and then I got this
black button up top and this was from a
men's section so when you're drifting
maybe Madness I go over the men's
section they'd have my stuff you're
gonna find the cutest things there since
it's really big I want to wear it as a
dress with like some heels like that was
looking really cute earlier booties or
something it definitely doesn't look
cheap I feel like it has like some kind
of quality to it okay the next thing I
tried on and when I first picked it out
I was kind of like hesitant whether I
should buy it or not because of I would
even orgies and there's these really
warm white I know just like pants and
then the last thing I got this is also
really cute it looks like this right
here it has like this lace detailing and
again I'm gonna cut this and once I cut
it I'm pretty sure it's gonna like fray
a little but it'll look good we yeah we
move on Dee yeah it's like okay so now
we're gonna be moving on to the lookbook
portion of this video so you're gonna
see how I style all these things that I
got and let's move on today
