hey guys it's Hayley sunny and today I'm
gonna be filming a back-to-school super
affordable Tryon clothing haul that was
a mouthful I started I started school
around two weeks ago and before school I
was like I don't have any clothes like
what am I gonna actually go to school
with cuz like I have a deep pop hint
hint and I'll link it down below but
basically the whole summer I literally
sold everything my closet so before
school started I was like wait what do I
actually wear to school so I had an over
to Zappa which I know has some really
cute stuff for really cheap prices and
I'll link them down below along with
everything this haul and picked out a
few things if you're not subscribed
subscribe the buns over there you know
it so the first thing is my favorite
thing in this whole haul and and my
closet I think right now and I've worked
my Seventeen magazine photo shoot that's
how much I like it so it's this black
and white checkered mini dress and the
things Apple is before you try them on
just wash everything in the wash first
because I feel like once you watch it
they actually like don't look so bulky
and like boxy so once I watch this it
fit my body as if it was made for it I
literally fit into it like a glove it's
crazy it's so adorable so this is
definitely at an attempt for me going
along with the whole jacquard of vibes
there's a lot of chequered isn't this
because I have aliens too really in
right now and I'm digging it so it's
this checkered dress with this little I
don't even know what you call that what
is it a very nice long grass right here
as you can see that I literally made a
math joke I'm really excited to wear
with like a cute little white bando or
maybe like a crop top or something I got
some really cute denim skirts and
they're really good quality but this
one's this like baby pink color and how
adorable
and then the next one is just like this
basic blue one which I also think is
really cute you can wear this one with a
lot of stuff and I finally I got it and
white because I don't have any white
shorts or skirts or any bottoms speaking
of white I got two pairs of the same
white shorts one of them so the smaller
thumbs and a medium check out my D pop
so basically they look like this they're
really just dressed in the bottoms and
then they're a lot shorter on the sides
I don't really know how for opiate this
would be for school I mean my school
dress code is pretty like non-existent
so I feel like I could get away with
anything but if your school does not
maybe like a flame around the waist
would be dope so Zappala and I never
really at work when it comes to body
suits I feel like they just don't go
with the shape of my body this one's in
this like nude olive color and look how
cute it had like this really cute open
back but when I wear this I get major
side boob like when I say major like
maybe like five six of my boob is
showing which is not the look I usually
go for if you like that you do you get
it links in the bio and then the same
one in a white color which I wish it fit
because I could wear this with so many
things moving on this type of dress has
been on Instagram so much I've been
seeing it on literally every one but
it's in this like nude color again and
it's like the Sun material the whole
back is open very cute very side boob
and like a lot of skin showing
I'd really like dresses for school
because it's putting on one thing and
looking cute Without Really Trying this
one's a gray and white one at the top it
laces up and it kind of has like a
sweetheart cut right here for some
reason it reminds me of Abercrombie &amp;amp;
Fitch like my Abercrombie phase where I
used to just wear Abercrombie dresses I
feel like this would be in my closet
thing but I'm digging it now too
I like it
there's more checkers this one's a
yellow one who is really bright I'm
sorry if I'm blinding you right now but
this is so much for the first one I kind
of look like tweeting it but Twitty is
the homie so I don't mind I got this
like orange top and it has how do you
like describe this material you don't
like when you go to the beach and like
their stores there and they sell like
white shirts for dads you know that
material that's what this is made out of
but I kind of like it it's very like
grease very beachy very Guatemala that's
what that's what I feel a lot Amala
vibes so this is Guatemala shirt it's
this bright orange color and then in the
back it ties up so it's an open back
it's a vibe is cute I promise this is
the last checkered thing and it's also
very adorable it's this black and white
checkered shirt and then in the bottom
right here it's cinches so it gives to
your waist that like really tiny look
you might have seen something similar to
this in my previous Sapa ha even I can't
get away with this at school but it's so
cute we're in Cali we're still kind of
in summer you know it's August it's this
white shirt and then you can tie it
right here so you can wear it as a
bathing suit cover-up or just like a
cute shirt it's good for back-to-school
begins
oh I'm obsessed with these I got three
of them so it's like this white tube top
and it's kind of like a bando because
it's really short but it's so cute goes
with everything I also got it in black
which I feel like this is the one I've
been wearing the most and then the baby
pink one and I'm really into baby pink
lately it's fun being a girl sometimes
you know I got two pair of jeans which
is a wrist comes a full jeans it's like
a literally gambling I wouldn't say I
lost my money though because look at
these so there are these two tone jeans
which a lot of people on Instagram have
been wearing so I was like um Kendall
vibes for 17 dollars or something
yes please my favorite part are the
bottoms right here because they're just
like de-stress box cut which gives like
a street wear look that I really like
they're kind of high-waisted too which
is pretty nice the second pair is kind
of similar it looks like this and then
it has like denim ruffles in this side
the bottoms I just folded up they're
like your classic mom jeans with a touch
the next two things is like literally
what's Apple is known for its their
straight cut camis so the arguing I look
like ones but a lot cheaper so I got
that in white and then I also got it in
black which I had in my last fall but I
wear it so often that I was like I need
out of that guy I don't remember
ordering this but that will just never
fails to surprise me this one's a halter
top and then again it ties in the back
it's a very brandy melville a little too
brandy melville for me this one's so
cute I wore it the other day and I got
so many compliments on it but it's just
like this basic white shirt except it
wraps around in the front so it's like a
wrap shirt it looks super cute a very
nice lime or that actually were these
bonds with it there are these
black/white cut pants and then they have
a red and white stripe in the side they
also have these slits in the sides but
this doesn't go all the way down to your
legs it kind of like cuts off at your
shin which out virtually where I was
like what is happening but then when I
like actually wore shoes it looks cute
so I was like I dig it the last thing I
got was a bathing suit and your paws
like I thought this was a back school
hall I have excuse you can definitely
wear this as a shirt maybe not to school
but I feel like it would work I mean it
looks like a crop top and this collar
just looks long but with my tan
Oh in the bottoms that just look like
this the last thing is an earring and it
looks like a paperclip on your ear but
it's bedazzled and it's gold that sums
up my whole haul I hope you guys enjoyed
it I'll see you in the next Friday
that's so crazy to say I feel like a
professional youtuber I love you guys so
much all the way to Pluto and back bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
