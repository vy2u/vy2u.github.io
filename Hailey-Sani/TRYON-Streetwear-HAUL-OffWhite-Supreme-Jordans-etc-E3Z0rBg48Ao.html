shoes these expensive pieces bad bottoms
this good sweet this Haley sunny and
Shay I'm gonna be filming a haul video
but first I wanted to make a quick
announcement you might have been able to
tell from my banner if you didn't I'll
just let you know now but from now on
I'm gonna be uploading every Saturday I
know I said Friday before but now I know
for sure that it will be Saturday so you
can expect new videos here on my channel
every Saturday moving on I'm so excited
for this haul because literally every
single thing is my obsession over the
summer I sold literally everything in my
closet so I was left with an empty
closet and I'm giving my closet a
makeover right now and I'm just buying
new stuff with all the money I saved up
so I'm gonna walk right in so the first
three things I got are from an app
called Grail and I'm not sponsored by
them or anything I wish they'd sponsor
me because I really like their app but
basically it's kind of like deep hop but
for men and it's a lot more like
designer brands so it's a little bit
more expensive but you can definitely
find stuff on there if you're a girl
that would fit you so the first thing is
a hoodie and it just looks like this and
it's by supreme it's actually supreme
Thrasher collaboration I really like the
sleeves because it says supreme and hot
pink and then the cartoon on the back is
really funny it says oh god why I keep
my boyfriend skate and then on the hood
there's just a bunch of like oh I
literally thought this was like Chinese
but says hey and destroy okay I like to
wear it with like leggings and it's
pretty effortless but it still looks
really dope so moving on I got an
off-white hoodie and I've been wearing
this way too often I think I need to
take a break because like people have
been coming up to me and being like you
need to stop wearing that just kind of
embarrassing but I just really like it
it's a red zip up and then the sleeves
just have like the whole off-white thing
going on and then same with the back it
just says white with the like vertical
lines it was a little pricey but it is
really good quality and if you're gonna
wear it so often then it's definitely
worth splurging on I think I'm basically
obsessed with it and I'm just like
really really basic cuz I like off-white
the third thing I got actually came in
the mail today so it was like perfect
timing so it's just like a black basic
and then it has the chrome heart logo
right in the pocket I like it because it
has like this really cool blue detailing
and then the chrome hearts logo in the
back and then right here too this would
go with pretty much anything and would
make literally any outfit look a little
bit more cooler you know like high high
so high so that's all I got from Grails
and I really like using that app because
you can find like a lot of steals
because usually these things would cost
like a lot more the next thing I have is
a merch honey and this is the Travis
Scott bird's-eye view tour March my
boyfriend's like obsessed with Travis
Scott and it kind of like rubbed off on
me even though like I'm nowhere close to
him the main reason I want to get this
is because of the color because I don't
own anything purple and it's just like
such a nice purple like with them in the
back it just has like everywhere he had
a tour and again this is really comfy
I'm obsessed with hoodies as you can
tell because they're just so easy to
wear when I'm going to school and I like
don't know what to wear and like in the
mornings is always so cold and I'm like
okay what do I do wear a cool hoodie
with some leggings and cool shoes and
then you have like a comfy cool outfit
so this I was debating whether or not I
should buy it because it is very like
out there it's this like caramel colored
wool not like real big huge jacket and
the main reason I got this is because
again when I'm going to school it's so
freezing in the mornings and I just want
to like go to school wrapped up in a
blanket but that's not very practical so
I bought a jacket that looks like one it
looks really cool on and it's so cozy to
wear it's not as soft as I thought it
would be it's by the brand I am Gio
which has been on Instagram like
literally everyone's been wearing I'm
Gia so I wanted to add this to my fall
closet I'm gonna be moving on to shoes
because I have four pairs and they're
all super dope the first pair are these
red and white Jordans and look how clean
these are like look how fresh they look
like I'm obsessed with them I wish I
could keep them in this condition
forever I got these from like the big
kids like boys section because like they
fit me and I dressed like a
why 75% of the time so I was like why
not I just really like the look of
Jordans I think they look so cool the
next three shoes are courtesy well
actually that was two of Nike because I
love my Nike family I've worked with
them before they're all the sweetest
coolest people and they hooked me up
with the coolest shoes ever these are
the vapor Max's and they're just so cool
like I don't even know what to say about
them like I want to give a speech about
that polluters stovall they remind me of
Cleese kind of I love the color
coordination like the rose gold with the
white blue and like the white it just
looks so clean I wear this with like
usually all-white outfits and then the
Blues like a pop of color
very nice Nike thank you so much and
they were also kind enough to send me
these new Cortez's and cortezes are like
the classic like their must-have these
are really cool because they're like
kind of like an off-white kind like a
tan color and then the back has like
snakeskin detailing these are literally
the only snakes I need in my life and
then they sent me the same shoes in like
a dark grey color which is also really
nice again they have the snakeskin in
the back I've never got around to
wearing these but these also look pretty
dope so thank you so much Nike you guys
are literally the best actually did a
second shoot with them but the campaign
hasn't released yet so the photos aren't
out yet but make sure you follow me on
my Instagram which will be like link
down below and everything to stay tuned
for those I'm so excited for you guys to
see them I had so much fun shooting and
I'm just really excited so stepping away
from the whole like hype beast and going
more into like hailey fundamentals when
it comes to hauls we can't have a halt
without Topshop in it because I'm so
obsessed like the people that work at
the bank are probably why does she spend
like 75% of her earnings at Topshop the
people at Topshop probably think why
does she come here more than I come here
and I work here so starting off I got
this cute little plaid miniskirt and I
just love the way it sits on my waist
since it ties up at the waist it
enhances it and then like it goes right
over your bike and your cute little bump
like I really like it I
long sleep to go with it but the cut in
the front is like a rectangular so it
shows a lot of collarbones and then I
really like the sleeves they're like
quarter length but they also like have
slits and flare out it looks so cute
with the skirt I look like a cute little
like schoolgirl sometimes look like a
businesswoman or sometimes like I wear
it with a nice little white eyes and I
was like I'm gonna like secretary it's
like just chain of your vibe you know
you guys are probably seen this dress
way too often because I'm literally
posted so many instagrams in it it's
like this flowy floral layer dress when
I wear it I feel like I'm kind of like a
bohemian flower girl princess I also
like to edge this up with like leather
boots and a leather jacket it looks like
this on and I'm soaps us with it I wish
I could wear it everyday the next thing
I have are these interesting pair of
jeans they look like this they have like
Clips going all the way down the main
reason I got this is when I tried it on
it fit my body perfectly as if it was
like me for it and I could just wrapped
around my legs and my butt and just like
look very good and I was like I mean
it's made from you so like I have to buy
it I have a little bit of trouble
walking in it because it is like metal
like going up my leg and I'm like kind
of like a robot gotta know it for the
looks guys I'm alright and then I got
this bodysuit and it says New York and
again this is very like skin tight so it
wraps around my torso and just like the
look of it with shorts it's just very
basic but you still look cute that was
it for this video guys don't forget
