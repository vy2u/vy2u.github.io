we're a girl band we're coming out with
an EP it's a Christmas album rockin
around the Christmas tree and I'm joined
today with Tati and Olivia I'm gonna
link both of their instagrams and
YouTube's down below check the Matt we
film to q and A's on their channels too
so I asked you guys to ask us questions
all about living in LA the social media
life like what happens behind the scenes
behind the camera what happens that
YouTube party's like not that I get
invited to any of them but the whole
tray the whole tray of tea and beans and
coffee oh my god Becky look at her butt
cheek now she want a photo you already
know that best thing about living in LA
Wow
you don't even live here I live in LA
for like a good 1/4 of the year yeah
everything about living in LA is a fact
that like everything is here and you
feel like you're on vacation all the
time like driving down Canon or like
palm drive I like yeah oh my god I so
drew I'm like this is my life like it's
kind of like everything is actually like
how you can so easily like go out and
like eat healthy stuff here like work
out and just do fun stuff everyone else
here like because they have like a
reason to be here you know everyone
might ask me an actor a model or
something that they're really passionate
about or it's just like inspiring
because like that energy like reflects
off of you too and it's like a city that
just keeps going so you're like always
doing stuff how to jumpstart a career in
the social / entertainment industry
jumpstart
is not really oh it ain't so wild unless
you're like bad babies like maybe go on
the dr. Phil show I tried to do
something else no not not something else
social media I mean Chinese no I mean to
like do something that people aren't
doing a lot yeah like either edit your
videos differently or like make other
content that like somehow pull people in
or just yeah I feel like the only way
you could jumpstart is by like being
different than everyone you're on the
same like level yeah and like also I
feel like just be yourself like don't
try and be like another person or like
edit your video it's exactly like
another person or just copy that person
make it's like they're already
subscribed to that person like they're
not can subscribe to a clone of that
person just join team ten tips are
modeling taking pictures taking pictures
of it well for the actually take
pictures from below because you look
taller yeah and bio below I don't mean
like under chin I mean like from like
that down on the ground like get close
to this and you're like I'd say like
fine
try to find some poses that like work
for you and like work with them like
Olivia puts her hand on her face that's
always I'm like touching my face any
words it works
we'll use some lighting yeah lady get
that golden hour Sun on your face and I
kind of like shaded and you're like and
like a little bit of like that to feel
like light diffuse do you think LA
changed your mindset at all Haley is a
lot more of a bitch
definitely because like yeah moving here
I like didn't know anything like I was
like a little innocent little baby being
here like you you're surrounded by so
many like different mindset mindset
mindset do you smoke people yeah I go
[Laughter]
definitely changed my mindset just like
makes me want to work harder because I
see so many people out here who are
working super super hard and I'm like
literally the only thing stopping me is
myself from working that hard so I'm
like let's do it and like there's so
much judgment going on around here like
for me like I used to be very self
conscious and really affected by like
what people used to say then moving here
you're constantly judged 24/7 and like
once you realize that you're you're like
oh it doesn't even matter it yeah
there's like a thing like that's really
true you don't even get affected by it
anymore you're like oh I don't care
like literally I literally love myself
away too much to what like what you say
like when you're walking down the street
there's so many types of people like
people with green hair like people with
7 million piercings on their face like
and it's not even a weird thing cause
like it's LA that's just the norm here
like being different is the norm and
like once you realize that you feel so
much better about yourself I used to
care a lot like if I would go to an
event or something if like other
Creators or just people were like
looking at you all weird and then I like
realize that we're all just like all
trying to do the same thing you're all
just trying to like what why would I
care so much about someone so like
liking my outfits like no that's life in
LA expensive ya can come here to like
Wisconsin or Texas it's actually true
though I wasn't Wisconsin but we'll
literally on Wednesday it was so cheap
like I literally got like a full-on
salad and it was like $5 but I got a
salad at like Whole Foods it would be
like 20 but it's cheaper than Hawaii
it's a little bit cheaper than New York
but it's expensive expensive it's more
expensive than this way what's the first
thing you notice about the people in LA
compared to where you came from not so
different because we all oh my god
I'm a different Ricky in there I know I
watched your whole moving telly videos
all of those okay anyways going oh my
god I've never been so honored
so there YouTube is not a thing social
media is not a thing like me doing that
they're people we're like what the
moving here everyone is doing what I was
doing and I felt like I belonged here
and here everyone's like have such a
hard like dry so like I was like it's my
time to shine and then oh yeah I know so
I'm from Hawaii I'm from Maui
everyone is just SuperDuper chill so
like can we just go surf you just go
hang out you go to school and then most
kids just kind of like they either go to
college in like California or they just
like be a sir
yeah like you forever and it's just like
super chill whereas here everyone as you
said is like super like inspired and
going and getting what they want so like
I kind of like was craving that and I
just need to get out and like go and do
something and here there's just like a
lot more opportunity for that I'm from
Texas and I feel like at least the part
where I grew up like my town a lot of
people were very like they had their
same stuff that they do and everyone
grows up they go to college they either
come back or they just get married and
then they have kids and like it's like
yeah it's not a set like thing so yeah
you're born knowing how you're gonna die
so old age okay and I feel like a lot of
so like everyone I feel like it's very
similar in Texas and so to be a youtuber
to be like different it was just kind of
like a little struggle so coming out
here was cool because like it's like you
said it's like all your people you can
shine none of us like we're born in LA
and like we're born into a community
like this we kind of like founder place
here which like says a lot about like
like LA and like how people attract to
him that's so I think it's like super
cool that we all were just kind of like
little beans out
termi you're from Hawaii like sitting on
my head right now
what are your thoughts about people
especially it's your name influencers
and people in LA you'll go to events and
like people like you know that person
knows who you are because they like
either like your pictures before like
comment and like method are you met that
and they literally act like they don't
know you and like they've never so I
think better than you oh there are arts
like though like oh you'll be like hey
like remember we met I like I know
beautycon and they'll be like oh we did
and you're like do you matter brain
cells or I don't never forget people
know I mean if I meet like a subscriber
and I got another event I'm like oh my
goodness it's not like you don't just
like forget people yeah I feel like it's
the people who are insecure about their
videos or like they're insecure about
themselves who like find themselves like
trying to like act like they don't like
above you just because they have more
followers or because they're working
with so-and-so or whatever it is yeah
and that stems from their own
insecurities but you can tell as an
outsider from the person that they're
acting rude to like if you're just like
standing there and they're just like
looking up and down at you and you're
just like yeah well what like yeah okay
I'm confident I like what I'm wearing I
like what I'm doing with my life
if you won't we kick me like that like
okay but yeah I don't understand what
people just can't be nice like that's
what I try wrong Rick an interaction I
have it's just like to like give
kindness and I don't understand like how
other people will like purposely be mean
that didn't get out of yeah literally
what do you and all our videos two
seconds they're like oh
I deal with fake people and fake friends
in LA I deal with them
I don't associate with them I don't know
that the moment you like realize that
someone's either trying to use you for
your followers or you see for whatever
it is like I feel like all three of us
have come to realization like you just
kind of like important to find the
people friends that like it's not just
like about going to parties are going to
things with and like putting up a front
and like it's all about it social media
and like Oh leap over BOTS it's like
just like just like I was like finally
yeah having a good time yeah good to
find people if you can be a hundred
percent yourself around here I like to
find friends that weren't even in the
social media yeah just so like I have
that good back balance where like
sometimes I'm in this world and like but
the thing is like with my social media
friends I can step into the real world
and with my real friends I can bring
them into the social media world yes and
if I'm this like beautiful balance where
I'm just in the middle and like really
happy because like some people just like
are so like buried deep in that social
media around like they're not even like
for the purpose of social media it's
like they want to take a snapchat
they're trying to still work to take a
snapchat that they look like they're
having fun that like but they're not fun
and that's like I've definitely had to
like find the balance with those people
and it's funny because I talk to all the
peoples managers and they'd be like yeah
like I made them squad and I really
thank you so much for watching this
video like I said make sure you watched
Aziz and Olivia's video answer some like
juicy questions on there too subscribe
