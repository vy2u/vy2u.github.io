really still crying like I salute every
time I read like a comment I start
crying again and like I really can't
stop my face gets so red and ugly when I
cry like I feel like I have some kind of
disease in my face but it's just like my
crying face I think they should make a
meme out of it hey guys it's Hayley here
and a quick story of how I got here
right now
I've been posted my social for a brand
that I'm working with Tampax it was
basically a brand deal between me and
Tampax and in honor of Mental Hygiene
day they chose me to be one of the
partners in order to donate million
tampons to women in need all around the
state and they supplied me with 40,000
to donate to an organization of my
choice so I chose the rescue mission
which is like in my community I posted a
picture on Instagram basically giving
you an overview about what's happening
today and what my partnership with
Tampax is and how the donation is going
to work and everything like that
we're basically donating so many tampons
to women in need all around the u.s. for
such a good cause and I will try to
inspire you guys to take action and your
communities as well and there is pause
oh my god I'm getting really emotional
the response I received from you guys
was actually crazy but all of you guys
just oh my god I really need a minute
and it's funny because I'm not even like
a really emotional person who guys all
said that you know the person that I've
become and the person I've been for so
long is someone who really inspires you
to do like similar changes in your life
which was the goal of those projects
from the beginning you guys know the
type of person I've been from the
beginning even before it was about brand
deals or anything like that I would
always just put out but it was like
trying to inspire you guys change your
points of view on certain things make
you feel more confident about yourself
and what started off with like the
telecommunication actors like 1964 when
the purpose of such thing was make like
communication easier for people in order
to connect them it's come to a point
where it's kind of made us all grow
really apart and it makes me so sad
there are people with such big platforms
and all they use it is
make other people feel bad because
they're not like them and working with
Tampax which is like such a woman
empowering company and where their goal
is literally to help other women and
make women comfortable and with who they
are I was first introduced to this
project it made me like realize like how
I never thought about this before it's
so crazy that we literally have stats of
tampons in our bathroom drawers probably
and we don't even double think about it
when we reach in when we go to the
bathroom to use one and how there's a
woman out there who literally can't
access their everyday basic necessities
like no one ever asked us when we were
born hey you want to get your period
when you hit puberty I was thinking to
myself like what would I do if I didn't
have access to like pads or tampons and
that's kind of the month like what would
I do that's crazy to think of there's
already some stress that follows getting
your period like cramps cravings mood
swings and imagine on top of all of that
you have to cope with how to actually
physically take care of yourself and
when I posted that picture of my
Instagram today I had no doubts that
what I was doing was the right thing and
I'll talk about that when you guys
commented saying you're so proud of the
message I'm trying to spread and the
person that I am it just really made me
take a step back and appreciate myself
and I'm not trying to be conceited at
all I just want to sit here in front of
you guys and be honest this feels
completely spontaneous I found myself
snap chatting about how this made me
feel really emotional and feel blessed
and then I was like this has to be more
than snapchat like I need to actually
sit here and connect with you guys when
you're creator trying to rise higher
than what you are and you're surrounded
with other people that are like more
successful than you or like more
successful than you and have a bigger
following and you kind of like look at
them and go okay what are they doing
that I'm not that I can do to get on
their level and I never want to be that
creator who's like unreachable and you
can't relate to them at all because
they're on like this incredible level of
perfect because that's so whatnot and I
just came in from the camera today to
make you guys a promise I want to
promise that the content I make is worth
creating and
everything that I do is going to have a
higher purpose and a better message and
something that actually leaves a mark
behind when you stop watching the video
or stop looking at the picture I don't
want my content to be superficial and
have really little value and no purpose
at all I always want to work with brands
like this one who have like such a good
message or something I genuinely support
and want to share with you guys because
I think it'll make a difference in your
lives too and I also want to thank all
you guys from support on this project
and I really want to thank Pam packs for
decided to collaborate with me because
they think that I'm worthy enough to
spread their message and I hope I never
become disconnected from you or
disconnected from my purpose and I
really want to you guys for being there
for me because you're really shaping me
to the person I am today and I'm going
to be in the future and I love you guys
like so much like so much which probably
farther than Pluto at this point bye
okay so I know I said bye but I was
editing back this video and I realized I
guess I was really overwhelmed and was
really emotional that I kind of forgot
to mention something really important I
kind of did mentioned briefly that idea
the tampons to the rescue mission in
Southern California but I didn't tell
you guys why I chose that organization
and what it does like who is exactly
going to I was like oh my god like they
don't even know so I'm clearly gonna
mention to you what the rescue mission
does so they basically provide
assistance to a bunch of families in all
some kinds of fields some are really
poor things like helping them find
shelter giving them food training them
for jobs giving them school education
providing them with health care so
basically all the tampons are going to
really poor families that can't afford
them and it feels so good knowing you're
active in helping an organization in
your community it's actually such a
fulfilling feeling and makes you really
happy so I definitely recommend it to
you guys if we all continue to act like
it's not our problem and there's nothing
we can do about it this problem will
never end and there will be nobody to
help those people so it's kind of our
responsibility believe it or not to
Athens but if I make that clear really
quick
now if it violates for the actual final
time bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
