have some flat tummy tea because the day
before I kind of had an oops moment in a
head some pizza and a little bit of ice
cream so I thought I start my day off
and get back on track with some detox
tea this basically like cleanses your
system stimulates your digestion TM
makes metabolism
was a movie fell asleep in a champagne
lunch it was pretty healthy I mean like
if you don't count like the cheese and
stuff but anyways I had a big serving of
vegetables so what we did was we just
like boiled every single vegetable we
had and then I had some lentil soup
because this is good source of protein
and it's fiber so it keeps you full and
I shared like my vegetables with my
family and then we had cheese and eggs
with some pepper and we also had two
dips hummus and guac and we had a big
green salad and what we did was we got
cute little breads and we put like guac
or like hummus and like eggs and cheese
and pepper and also some chilies and it
just tasted super good super cute love
it and that was my much
so we got spinach cakes with brown rice
some like kale Brussels sprout salad and
then lemon cranberry quinoa so I just
ran on the treadmill for 35 minutes I
ran three miles a little more than three
miles and it's been like 50 minutes and
I finally stopped sweating so I thought
I'd film this I still look like a hot
mess but now I'm moving on to strength
training I also have ankle weights on

those moments when we just kind of slip

activate T which is like tea that you
