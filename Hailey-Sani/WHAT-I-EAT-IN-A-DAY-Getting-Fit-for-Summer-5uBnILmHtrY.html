you still have tumblr life is 2017 but I
have attachment issues okay okay guys if
you study today I'm coming at you in the
least violent way possible with a
brand-new what I eat in a day video if
the sitter show up in your subscription
box and you're probably not subscribed
to me and you've definitely in the
bud right here or here just me being a
major Q to broom pretending to be funny
not knowing less either subscribe
buttons on but I genuinely don't know
what's I thought I might be like 50%
dyslexic I'm still debating on it you
guys love it when I film health fitness
food you know like being like healthy
video so I made one and sole purpose
actually even want to make this videos
because I discovered this app club life
some and it's pretty cool so I went a
lap and the first thing that made me do
was take this life score TM test and it
doesn't have any math questions so I was
like I will take it so I took the test
and it gave me an eighty and me being
like the h2 and I am even a math I was
like what like what it was like you're
can't healthy but you're not all the way
there but here are some things that you
can do to get to a hundred so it's kind
of like bring Kleenex box tissues to get
extra credit except you're being fit at
the same time it's basically like a food
tracker except instead of like being
only focused on calories which I really
hate it focuses on like the nutrients
you're eating the vitamins you're eating
the different foods you're eating so you
can have like a more balanced diet when
I took it it was like Haley you're
laughing on season where is your fish so
now it's like trying to get me into the
habit of eating more seafood it's really
cool because when you take this test it
gives you like custom feedback into your
personal diet
so before I start was my what I eat in a
day I want to quickly mention that
because it's a really cool app and I
think you'll really enjoy it I'll link
it down in the down below and thank you
to life some for collaborating with me
on this video and not being an app that
pushes you to count your calories
obsessively instead incorporating fun
ways to make up on the nutrients you're
laughing with their trackers or their
plans or their recipes and I don't want
that to be like oh like she sponsored
like they're paying her to say this like
I wouldn't tell you guys something
it truly like I'm really sorry for
always talking a lot in my intro let's
get started first thing I do when I wake
up in the morning is drink around half a
liter of water because I'm so dehydrated
from not drinking anything throughout
the night and for breakfast I either
have a smoothie usually or some cereal
but this is actually pumpkin flax
granola so it's really healthy it has a
lot of fiber protein it doesn't have
really bad sugars for you and then I add
some strawberries which is like a
natural sweetener and fruits really good
for you obviously how to turn it off so
I never run my ID on the boy so wanna
hear baby tickets and I always add
vanilla soy milk because cow milk like
discussed me and I don't really add a
lot because I like my granola crunchy
and then I added my strawberries and eat
that up to prevent my stomach from
making weird noises in class I bring
like a Naked Juice and a granola bar
usually and those keep me pretty filled
up for lunch we decided to go to Fred
Segal which is one of my favorite
restaurants here in LA I was craving
something a little sweet so I got this
pineapple coconut smoothie and I also
ordered their seafood risotto which is
so good and I put that into my seafood
tracker so I can keep track of the sea
food I eat throughout the week and this
was also very yummy so I don't have
ingredients that I need to make the
dinner I wanted to make so I'm running
to the market real quick to grab those
success so to start off my dinner I got
a little bit of olive oil and orzo and
waited for that to simmer in the pan for
a couple minutes and after I drained my
pre soaked rice and put that into the
pan as well
after slightly mixing them together I
added like around two to three cups of
water into the pan so it can cook and
while that was cooking I decided to move
on to my salad and can you guys look at
my avocado seed removing skills think so
to make the dressing I got some avocado
some lime juice a little bit of avocado
oil you can use like any oil if you want
and my dog was trying to eat it but I
then added a little bit of salt and mash
them all together so I mix that all
together and top the salad off with some
sweet corn slightly later my rice was
cooked and I added some garbanzo beans
on top for a kick of protein because
that's always very good and that was my
dinner it was very delicious and I ate
it all
I hope you guys enjoyed this video if
you want me to do more of these
definitely let me know because I'm down
I'm just charming out of the food I eat
I love food
you can definitely download life limb if
you want to using the link in the
downbar I love you guys so much all the
way it's a puto and that I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
