traveling in Greece so I thought I'd do
a what ie today well I'm on the go if
you're not already make sure you
subscribe but without further ado let's
get started with red roll
I literally have the same breakfast for
like a week straight now but basically I
get Greek yogurt because Greek yogurt in
Greece is so good I always get a
fresh-squeezed orange juice in the
morning stew because it's so refreshing
and really good for you and then I like
to drizzle some honey on to my yogurt
with a bunch of fresh fruits I don't
know why but I feel like fruit in the
Mediterranean is like 10 times more
refreshed and like actual fruit in
America so like this is my favorite
breakfast ever
I'm obsessed with it it's so filling and
healthy and it also tastes really good
on my sauce because it I feel like I
ended up ordering a Greek salad almost
every other meal but a Greek salads
basically tomatoes feta cheese cucumbers
and olives even though it's not Greek
cuisine they make their sushi so good
because the fish is so fresh and this
day I ended up ordering some tuna nigiri
and it tastes so good the fish literally
melts in your mouth
this place literally kicks sugar fish in
the ass obviously meant to be full off
of four pieces of sushi so I ended up
having a little bit of Mills tomato
spaghetti it was also very yummy and
fresh and I ate literally half of it
speaking of being a fat ask me and now
also ended up sharing this incredibly
beautiful piece of dessert it was no
story with chocolate and vanilla ice
cream absolutely heavenly a couple of
hours later I ended up ordering a fruit
platter because I wanted something kind
of light and refreshing and I'm in love
with fruit if you couldn't tell already
so that was my pre-dinner snack kind of
dinner and Greece is kind of done family
style so we order a bunch of things and
then share it also my family ordered
this Greek salad which this is usually
what a Greek salad looks like and then
we ordered shrimp saganaki
it's basically shrimps in this really
nice tomato butter garlic sauce and they
sprinkle some feta cheese on top and it
tastes so good you basically like dip
your bread in and then you can also eat
the shrimp's and we also ordered this
big fat fish and my mom like cleans it
like we don't like to have the people
there clean it they like to do it
themselves because like I don't know
they like to eat the head and stuff or
weird and then they gave me the pretty
parts and I put some olive oil and lemon
on top and had that I hope you guys
enjoy this video if you did give it a
thumbs up but ask me my next one
love you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
