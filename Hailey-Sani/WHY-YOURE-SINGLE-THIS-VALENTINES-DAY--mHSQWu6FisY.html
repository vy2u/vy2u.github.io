guru decorates their room for for one
day every year with our DIY room decor I
really don't understand this community
really but um anyway so I'm wearing a
pink shirt and my hair is all up and I
waiting my eyeliner and some of the
February so that could only mean one
thing I be filming a video right pretend
I care about Valentine's Day so yeah
what better way to celebrate it then do
some online Valentine's Day related
quizzes because I need an answer to why
my love life doesn't exist so the first
quiz I found is on Seventeen magazine
and it's what's your Valentine's Day
personality this should be interesting I
can't wait you're at a party and you see
a hot guy who's just your type across
the room you keep talking to your
friends if he notices you it's meant to
be walk right over and start up a convo
make eye contact and smile then wait for
him to come to you I feel like I
wouldn't just wait for him to come to
you because that's never gonna happen
but number three number three describes
me perfectly your history teacher
shoutout to the spine ask the classic
question that you're pretty sure you
know you immediately you raise your hand
as high as it can go
keep sitting quietly you don't want to
risk getting your wrong in front of
everyone prom is just around the corner
in the guy who really like hasn't asked
you yet That moment when Seventeen
magazine messes up its quiz what the I
raise my hand and ask questions a lot so
prom isn't just around the corner and
the guy you really like hasn't asked you
yet check around to see if he's thinking
about asking anyone in particular and
drop some hints that you're into it
lying bed and do some serious wishing
for him to ask you I could see myself
doing that give yourself a little pep
jog wait until you are alone and just
ask him one it's Friday night and you
have no plans That's not me at all but
you really feel like doing something fun
Seventeen magazine
knows you stay home and watch TV
everyone probably already made plans
send a mass text to see what everyone
you know is up to definitely bad though
I usually don't I'm a grandma you're
gonna see on a paper that's never gonna
happen that you worked extra hard on
that's never gonna happen you marched
straight up sure she joined demand
explanation
he'll to the s your guy my guy is my dog
honey hasn't called in a few days and
you're really annoyed am I the only one
that hates talking to people on the
phone like please don't call me on this
your mom you called him you don't like
to play games send him a text just
seeing what he's up to wait until he
calls if he should always make the first
move mmm he hasn't called me in a few
days first of all rude dump that bitch
send him a text I feel like that's what
I do you're miss easy-breezy cover girl
you always go with the flow Valentine's
Day it could just be another night or
something spectacular you'd be cool
either way oh my god if you don't have
expectations are too high you will never
be disappointed but even though you're
as cool as a cucumber is okay just
sometimes reach for the stars I am the
star Sunday what are you saying
take the why you're single on
Valentine's Day quiz this should be
really interesting oh look she's also
wearing a pink shirt we're basically the
same person your favorite song is what
the Fox say out of these songs
definitely drunken love Chuck oh my god
accurate representation of my
Valentine's Day night actually it's not
I'm gonna go to on Valentine's Day
Valentine's Day party which show would
you most likely watch anything on Animal
Planet my life is the Animal Planet so
no thank you
friends American Idol no friends motor
socks are you wearing right now wait how
are my socks colors supposed to
determine why I'm single on Valentine's
Day like your favorite phone app is
Twitter tinder Facebook vent Instagram
also email I'm lame I'm also a 35 year
old
that goes on daily walks actually true
on a Friday night what shoes are you
most likely wearing nun slippers your
friends would describe you as hold on
I'm gonna call my friend and ask her to
describe me wait do I have friends Wow
