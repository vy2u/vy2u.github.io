for this because I got the cutest
clothes that are like super trendy right
now a bomber jackets cute keels
high-waisted jeans for like the best
deals ever and I definitely want to
share them with you guys so you can go
köppen so I'm going to be starting off
with Topshop and unfortunately these
were the only things that I got in this
haul that weren't really that affordable
but basically they're the ones in Jamie
like black high-waisted jeans they fit
me perfectly they're high-waisted so
they're good if you don't have a booty
also they have rips right here
you guys know Topshop jeans are like one
of the best jeans ever invented because
they have lots of different sizes so
you'll definitely find one that fits
your body moving to an online store
called yes style and you guys know I
always shop online I like shopping
online more than I do
shopping like in physical stores anyways
I got a black bomber jacket and it's so
cute
I've wanted a bomber jacket for so long
and I finally got one I also have one
green the inside is like orange so yeah
it's really cute and then I got this
like faux leather like cap and it makes
me feel really badass I'm like trying to
step out of my comfort zone try new
things and then I got these socks and I
really sucks a lot they have like the
blue and red stripes and I like to like
fold them like that and wear them with
sneakers they make your feet look so
cute never thought I'd say that and then
finally I got I think my favorite pair
of shoes at the moment I got these black
heels and they have tassels they have
the soft material I forgot what it was
called I don't and they're really great
quality I really like them they're black
do they go with a lot of things so
moving on to Victoria's Secret you guys
know they have like their semi-annual
sale or whatever and they have like the
greatest sales ever or three times so I
ordered bathing suits off of there
because they were so cheap so I got this
line one is
kind of small on me but it was like $7
or something and then I got these
bottoms that have the straps on the side
and I also got this bottom and this was
$10 and I was like the little like lime
thing so like these will definitely mash
together and this matches with this too
so I'm like really proud of myself
because they all match
unfortunately I can't wear them for like
another three months but definitely
check out the Victoria's Secret sale and
then just want to got from pink and it
is there like half sip like famous like
yoga thing I like the pink and yeah it's
really cute this was like $26 moving on
to another online store that I love to
order jeans from because they're jeans
are like the cutest things ever I went a
little crazy with the jeans on fashion
over comm I'll leave the link to the
website down below but the first thing I
got were these green ok these are green
guys on camera these are kind of like
brown almost like army pants I don't
know of it they're so comfortable they
literally if you like sweatpants um I
like the pockets on the side and then
they puff up in the bottom I got these
high-waisted black jeans these are super
high waisted they go all the way like up
to your ribcage and a little past it too
they're also really comfortable and then
I got another pair of black high waisted
jeans but these have like slits and the
knee and these are literally the same
thing as a Topshop one but you can never
have too many pairs of black jeans and
then I got this a burgundy like maroon
colored one it looks red on camera what
but they're high-waisted they also have
slits are right where the knees are it's
like a real color guys it's not black or
white or grey and literally one of my
favorite jackets ever right now I got
this off I love it so much I wore this
in my last nail but big sheep not real
cheap obviously but like it reminds me
of the sheath jacket and it's so comfy
it's huge every time I wear it to school
at least 10 people like technique
they're like you're really
I'm like thank you so soft so cute so
arm 10 10 no 11 out of 10 that's how
much I love this jacket and then I went
to Zara and Zara is also having a sale
