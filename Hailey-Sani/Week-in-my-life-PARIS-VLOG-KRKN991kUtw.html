obsessed I just want to speak French
forever and I just keep speaking French
to ever I see and they're probably this
girl can't speak French why is she
trying and I'm just like we are at

needed that will break but we're gonna

Tropico V Isaac king dymas hello oh my
god I would so want to live here if you
live in Paris just know you're lucky
sometimes we forget how lucky we are
when we live cool places because you're
just so used to it but as a very
touristy person right now I want to
remind you appreciate this beautiful
beautiful city every corner of Europe is
so beautiful it's like a little treasure
there's a glow is no longer my
highlighter it is sweat because Paris is
for God but we're going back to our
hotel because jetlag did get the best of
us and we're a little sleepy we're a
little tired you're just gonna go back
to the hotel
chill for a little and then go back out
hello everybody so we came to the hotel
and we all passed out for like three
hours but now we just changed and we're
out again we're going to loose a clicker
which is like a view so we can see the
whole city and then we're gonna go to
learn new languages like that I don't
know but it's gonna be really fun it's
gonna be a fun-filled evening and I'm
also really starving so we're gonna have
to take care of that
as this is made out of chocolate like
this whole thing is made out of
chocolate with a break so we just
wrapped up at sac liquor now we're going
to Milan Rouge and it's like I don't
know like directly moved to the actual
show but we're just gonna be like around
the area walking around guys it's 9:30
p.m. and literally it's still just
bright out like this is my favorite
thing in the whole world before we go to
Moulin Rouge we decided that we're
really really hungry and that we should
eat first so we're going to this place
called pink mama it's a restaurant that
a lot of you guys actually recommended
to me through DM and I'm really excited
I'm really hungry
the moola actually no idea what it is
like every store on this tree has
something to do with sack so I'm gonna
sing it something already
buzu Patti it's another day it's day two
I'm sorry my vlog from the previous day
kind of cut off abruptly we've literally
just got home and I fell asleep
anyways today is day two and it's
actually a really exciting day because
yesterday a bunch of you were like
messaging me and damning me being like I
wish I could meet you except Sarah and I
was like why don't I just do a meet-up
so a bunch of you can come and I can
meet all of you guys so today we're
having a meet-up in front of the Eiffel
Tower I'm about to do my makeup and get
ready for the day and then we're gonna
go and get breakfast
kind of chilly today yesterday was super
super war
I got a cheese omelet with some orange
juice I already got a sandwich you know
also about the same thing as me so we
just had our breakfast and now we're
going to the Eiffel Tower and meet you
guys what if no one's there that's my
biggest here that's this is our first
meetup ever and that's theirs like I've
never been so nervous because like my
only fear is what if no one shows up
do I still even flip the stuff in the
vlog like that's so bare good
whatever I was go up to random people
I'm be like oh my god I love meeting you
it's right here and it's so pretty but
there's like construction going on in
the front of it so it's kind of like
difficult I mean it just
I know what to do I'm really scared I
was very clear when I said the meetup is
in front of the Eiffel Tower
because what like which side like I was
just kind of stupid and I don't know
where to go now
so just trying to figure that out
I love you so much look at all these
beautiful pretty girls that actually
came through Meetup I'm fangirling like
I'm fangirling cuz I was like oh my god
nothing's gonna happen we're all gonna
be just sitting here but hey guys this
is Ella and she set up all night making
me I kill again
I'm gonna go to a hotel I'm gonna be
like you got yourself a say your name
your age you're chillin my age so um
I've gone from twos okay years old I'm a
genius design in here oh that's so cool
okay I'm gonna start crying hi i'm i a--

people just showed up and I'm just so so
grateful that I have family like
literally so many people who came and it
was so hard saying bye to everybody like

just can't stop parking out a lot of
energy I was just so Wow peep Wow Wow

people so cute we took so many selfies I
need water

pants that's all right
no you know so right now we're about to
go on the Metro and we're gonna
to the Louie Vuitton Foundation which
apparently is like an exhibition with a
bunch of like fashion related things and
the girls in the meetup told us that
it's really beautiful and we should
definitely go there especially since be
like take two it's gonna be a little bit
of a trick I look it's a little like
balcony like roof top of this house I
would probably die to live up there
I like their like how you well if I die
I can't live so so so much more though I
got people said no but they said and all
of Kabul is an emphasis so they were and
Oliver son says to see this is because
Oliver use your pepper over the phone
massage come Dima okay so these lovely
ladies she was at her meet up earlier
but she they literally came to the
Louboutin Foundation because we put on
her story and they found us it's nap
time and I'm eating this kinder
chocolate because we don't have it in
America and it's really really yummy
okay just woke up from a nap I still
look like I'm sleeping but I change into
a different outfit just because it's a
little bit chillier out now so I wanted
to have some jeans on and I think we're
gonna go to we're actually gonna go to
the matinee and then probably got some
dinner because we're a little hungry now
did you guys ever meet her no have you
ever introduced yourself to my blog she
has the hiccups I think we're gonna do
the lure but we're not gonna go inside

we're just gonna like go outside it
and I want to film this outfit or be up
soon ago we have here the lethal squish
I love squish music dudu epic last oh my
god guys I was taking a picture and the
people that are selling like the Eiffel
Tower this man was like hello Lady Gaga
brought her weird we're at MMA this is
what it looks like kind of looks like
every other part of hair it's amazing
how like in cafes in Europe people
actually talk to each other and they
have like conversations when they're
eating instead of like going on their
phones
that's kind of like another reason I
really like your like there's
interaction like people act like look at
these people like they're all just we're
all just talking like they're using
their hands they're like you know no got
a cheeseburger because she's bad guys it
is 10:00 p.m. and look at the sky i if I
lived here I don't think I'd ever get
over this like literally that's my dream
little bar that goes square things are
happening here that's what it looks like
it had like tents all around so we're
gonna go in and see what they are it's
just like a really big Street and nose
really really cold it looks like it was
a flea market but they blocked it off
for the nighttime so that's pretty sad
should we go on the metro let's go guys
the shopping off it's like get ugly
Lafayette it's a very famous shopping
off it's currently closed like we
thought this area would still be like
poppin right now but it's not and we're
gonna and we're gonna call it a night
