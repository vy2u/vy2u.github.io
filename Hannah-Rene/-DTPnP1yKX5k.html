appearance in this video because
honestly I've got no false eyelashes on
which is just not me I've also got no
fake tan on like I just don't feel like
myself at all but it's fine
anyway sidetrack I'm really sorry that I
didn't upload last week it was kind of a
combination of just being like busy
which I know is just like a really
shakes use and but also just not knowing
what's a film like I feel like last week
I was just on such a block like I just
had such a block creatively like I just
had nothing in mine that I wanted to
film so I thought I'd do a QA kind of
like chatty video because I've not done
one of these in ages and I know I
usually do these uncut um but honestly
like it takes me so long to do an encore
video because if anything night happens
in it hope that anything happens in it
that I don't want to include but
sometimes I just like start fresh all
over again and it can take me so long to
film so I'm gonna do this as uncut as I
can when I'm actually going through the
questions but I am gonna cut it a little
bit actually we'll have already seen
also do you actually enjoy these videos
like let me know if you actually enjoy
these videos because I feel like I just
end up sitting and chatting for
ages and I'm like the people actually
want to watch this and let me know okay
let me know what videos you want to see
because honestly like I'm just
struggling it a minute with what's a
film because I feel like I don't know I
feel like I've just done so much like
clothing and makeup and I feel like it
gets a bit same old same old or does it
not I don't know I nearly just drop my
Sophie asked can you do another party
like you did at Christmas I was actually
speaking about those fun Instagram live
if anyone doesn't follow me on Instagram
or Twitter if you want to be part of the
next chat video and it's just at feinex
Renee and yeah I do really want to do
another one so when we did the one at
Christmas I had in mind to do another
one on like for Valentine's Day
and because I thought that would be
really cute but I just couldn't like get
it organized in time because it was so
soon after Christmas um so in my head
now I'm thinking maybe doing one for my
21st birthday I feel like that could be
really fun because it'd be like nice to
celebrate with all of you guys um so I
don't know I think I'd have it in the
same place because this is another dial
on my like obviously if I have it in the
same place it can still only be limited
tickets I think
we had about 150 tickets and they sold
out so quickly so that's the only things
I do want to do it in the same place but
at the same time I felt really bad that
a lot of you wanted tickets and then
couldn't get tickets um so maybe I'll do
two days instead of one I don't know we
need to like actually sit down and have
a proper think about it because we were
gonna do two days for the Christmas one
sorry this is like complete sidetrack we
were gonna do two days for the Christmas
one after seeing there was like a lot
more demand for tickets and stuff but it
was just a case of like hiring the venue
out from the day and doing a whole lot
of new goodie bags like it was just so
it would have been like so much more
work if that makes sense not that I
don't wanna like putting the work for it
but it was just like it would have been
a lot if you know I mean so I dunno
maybe we'll do it in the same place
maybe I'll find like a bigger place but
I kind of like that it was quite
intimate I don't think I'd want it to be
I don't think I'd want many more people
there in like one la it don't make sense
cuz I think it's nice that it's quite
Internet and just their 150 girls and it
was just really nice and chilled so let
me know for anyone who went to the
Christmas one or anyone that would want
to go to one in July
it'd be in July because that's when my
birthday is but yeah let me know Jessica
asked if you weren't doing YouTube where
would you be today and why I honestly
have no idea like no idea I did not know
what I wanted to do when I was in
college um I feel like I might have done
something with psychology so before I
started YouTube and stuff and I really
enjoy psychology that was my favorite
thing to do a level and then basically I
started youtube in college and then if I
was going to go to uni the Uni cost that
I picked was for marketing because it
kind of fits like hand in hand with
doing YouTube honestly like I had no
idea I saw someone else ask a question
about that like if you're leaving
college and you have no idea what to do
like watch your advice and I think a lot
of people like just don't know for ages
like you don't have to necessarily like
find what you want to do really early on
like people always have it set in their
mind like what they want to do and then
eventually they change their mind
because I don't know does anyone know
what they're doing
in life I don't know I don't so I
obviously have no idea I feel like
something to do with psychology because
I loved I loved psychology like it was
my favorite subject ever I got an A in
it I was pretty proud okay got an A in a
little psychology so Emma asked are you
going to summer in the city this year I
honestly don't know like I've never been
before so I didn't go last year um I
feel like it's in August is it in August
I'm sure it was in August last year I
don't know should I go should I not go I
know a lot of people are going cuz I
know a lot of people from my management
I go in so maybe maybe not I'm not
entirely sure I always say good things
about it though so Molly asks do you
think you and Kate will be together for
a long time have you spoken about the
future I guess we have spoken about it I
feel like we've been together for over a
year now so I feel like when you get to
that point with him he's 24 as well I'm
20 so I feel like you do tend to have
that conversation eventually um I think
so I like to think so I don't know you
can never know Kanye I like to think
that we will be um but I don't know is
that like a really chance yeah I like to
think that we will be like the best
thing about Kane okay it's like he's
literally my best friend and I've never
been in a like been in a relationship or
known organ-like seen anyone or anything
whether like my best friend as well like
we get on so well um we just like laugh
at the same kind of stuff like we just
have the same sense of humor we like the
same kind of stuff we just got on so
well so for that reason I feel like we
will be and I hope we will be I don't
know
yeah everyone keeps asking for us to
film together and I feel like we will at
some point but the thing with Kane like
obviously you guys don't know him or
anything yet but he's like so shy like
he's really shy so yeah he takes a bit
of warm enough if you know what I mean
Sarah asks this is actually really funny
because I was like she's just saying
this but Sarah asked how do you come up
with ideas for videos and what do you do
if you're having a creative block
wouldn't need to put a video out um
so last week like I said I just had a
complete crazy blog I feel like I'm
still having a creative block um I know
I just I feel like I never want to force
content like I know
on a film anything for the sake of it so
if I like need to put out a video is
that will be because it's like sponsored
if you know what I mean and then
obviously I know what I'm filming for
that but yeah I don't like to film
unless I'm really like feeling what I'm
filming does that make sense I don't
know that's probably like the most
difficult thing about doing YouTube I
think you know like actually thinking of
new and fresh content all the time
I mean makeup and stuff is good because
there's always new trends but I feel
like I don't know I feel like makeup
sometimes just gets a little bit same
old same old so that's like one of the
most difficult things about doing
YouTube I would say is that constantly
thinking of like good content that you
know people will enjoy watching and not
just doing stuff for the sake of it okay
I don't know your name but your twitter
is called finding that fashion home you
asked any advice for someone who
struggles to stay on a diet slash health
kick and always gets tempted by sweet
treats and then someone else replied
underneath saying that is actually me I
need as much advice about this as
possible so I think like the whole
attitude I think like basically when it
comes to eating healthy or just like
being a healthy person I think when you
start to think of it as like an actual
lifestyle rather than a diet is when um
you just start to feel better about it
because I feel like that idea of being
on a diet is like so you're gonna be on
a diet for a set amount of time and then
after that you can go back to eat and
how you used to or whatever else and I
feel like that's when people struggle
because it's this idea of like trying to
be healthy in a set amount of time
whereas like the way you should think
about it is just having like a healthy
lifestyle but still having treats
because I feel like when people aren't
diets they like super strict like I've
done the same like if I've gone on a
diet in the past or tried to like be
healthy like have a healthy diet if that
make sense I tried to be like really
strict and just not have any treats
because I'm like no Hannah you're on
like a diet like you can't do that blah
blah blah um and that's like unhealthy I
feel like that in itself is an unhealthy
thing to do so instead now I just try
and say to myself like I try and live
like a healthy ish lifestyle and so I
try and eat like healthy but I'll still
let myself have treats like I've
literally just had a packet of salt
Kronus halfway through the day or I'll
have like some chocolate like some Oreos
or whatever else and I'll let myself
have treats throughout the day but I'll
just try and keep it balanced with like
healthy stuff I think that's not like my
best advice vote because if you just see
it as like a diet and trying to be
really strict and it just won't work I
don't think I don't think that's like
how were meant to be he's just don't be
like too hard on yourself and don't be
too strict on yourself because you won't
stick to it I always found that if I was
ever trying to be really strict so say
I'd go like a whole week just eating
really straight like vegetables and
fruits and stuff like that and then have
been like no chocolate or anything that
I really wanted to eat um it gets like
the end of the week or a couple of days
you know whatever and I just completely
cave and then just eat like loads of
 just let yourself have some treats
every now and then is what I'm saying
don't be too strict on yourself because
you don't stick to anything and it's not
like a sustainable lifestyle so yeah
courts said what do you get from Starr
but a little bit what do you get from
Starbucks McDonald's and what do you get
from the cinema from Starbucks if I want
something cold and I need them to bring
back climate fresh is like they bring
back climate freshes in the summer and
I'm so ready for it
so that's what I get in summer when I
want something cold because it's like my
favorite drink ever other minute if I
want something cold I get a mango
passion fruit just because it's like
fruity and like fresh and then if I want
something Hart I got a vanilla soy latte
and I asked for an extra pump of vanilla
in it because I don't put any sugar or
sweetener in it but I feel like if it
doesn't have the extra oomph or vanilla
like it's not it's a little bit too
bitter for me like I love stuff that's
sweet I'm in terms of McDonald's I don't
really go to McDonald's a lot so I don't
really get anything from that I do like
McDonald's hash brown though I will say
to have and in terms of the cinema I
just usually get popcorn because I feel
like if you're gonna get something at
the cinema it has to be popcorn I don't
know about anyone else you always get
sweet popcorn as well I don't get salt
salted popcorn um I used to like my
ex-boyfriend he used to get half salted
and then half sweet so he got the salt
on top and the sweet underneath so it's
like savory and then sweet after but
there's something about salted popcorn
that I'm just like no
I just want it all to be sweet what does
everyone fair let me know in the
comments you assault a popcorn kind of
person or sweet popcorn kind of person
let me know Samantha asked what are your
favorite snacks I love hummus like
honestly we need to get some hummus
actually because we've not got any in
the frigid minute but I love hummus and
I'm really picky because the only one L
e is the M&amp;amp;S hummus that's like the
reduced fat one but like the extra olive
oil one if you're not I mean so good
it's like the best I must ever really
good with like little flat breads and if
you want me to do like a what I eat in a
day I can do that because I feel like in
a minute I'm being really good with ye
and just kind of eat imbalanced and like
cooking a little bit more as well now
that we've had the kitchen done me a mom
like cook pretty much every night so
yeah the people enjoy those videos I
enjoy watching those Guppies been doing
them a lot the minute and I really
enjoyed them so let me know ok so jewel
asked I hope that's your name I can't
tell this Julie or jewel and what is
your dream car so I actually still have
the first car that I ever got at the
minute so I Drive a mini one and it's
the first car I ever bought and you know
it's held up very well I have to say
it's held up so well it's like my little
baby
but yeah I'm trying to like save money
at the minute so I haven't gotten
anything different but if I was like if
I had the money to buy it the minute I
would love a Audie tt-rs
because my boyfriend Kane has an Audi
rs3 and I just love it like it's just
such a cool car and so I'd love like the
TT version because it just looks insane
and I love it but it's expensive okay
it's expensive so maybe one day not
right now Caitlin asked what is one
place in the world that you would love
to travel to and why I really want to go
to the Maldives that is like a hundred
percent
top of the bucket list it just looks
insane I feel like so many people have
been this year and I just see it like
plastered all of my Instagram feed and
I'm like I need to go but it's just like
such an expensive holiday so hopefully
we're gonna go next year because I think
the best time of year to go is like kind
of December to April time so I'm hoping
that we're gonna be able to go next year
at some point but it's definitely like I
need to go at some point like I have
you know doctor said I'd love to know
more I'd love to know more in general
about you so here's your Idol favorite
youtuber what'd you do in your spare
time I had why did you become a youtuber
um who are you currently sponsored by
tiny plants with huge up all over I love
you so much love you too that was like
so many questions in one so who's your
idol um that's an interesting question
because there's no one that I really
like think of as an idol I guess like my
mom I love my mom she's so hard working
on my dad of course I love Taylor Swift
anyone who knows me knows that I love
Taylor Swift I have done it for years um
and in terms of YouTube Jaclyn hill it'd
probably be like my idol on YouTube
because she was the person that really
like got me into makeup and kind of just
got me into YouTube in general so yeah
oh my god that all girls girl power
favorite youtuber
she know why it changes all the time but
at the minute I'm absolutely obsessed
with Shane Dawson like I love Shane
Dawson's video videos he just like these
little three-part series at the minute
and I'm obsessed with them but I'm like
I need more okay give me more what do
you do in your spare time that's an
interesting one like after minute I've
just been so chilled like I've not
really been doing much so me and came
went to Brussels last weekend and then
we got back obviously on like Monday and
this week I've just been kind of like
chilling and not really like doing two
months just like a little work bits but
yeah I guess in my spare time me and my
mum love to watch like a good drama on
TV so I always watch TV with my mom in
the evenings um what else
I guess just spending time with like
friends and family and stuff like that's
what I like to do in my spare time I
don't really go out and watch anymore
like I used to go out a lot like out
what I don't really I don't
mmm I don't really do that anymore I
kind of like just being in and like cozy
I feel like when I guess system that I
want to but Francis asked hey hon what's
your fave 3 drinks on a night out I love
this question okay so in terms of like
cocktails and stuff I love a porn star
martini I just love it I feel like it's
just such a good and easy drink I also
love like a frozen shore read a curry
but I feel like that's more of a holiday
drink so that always reminds me of like
summer and anything with vodka
okay so vodka is like my saved
I don't know if anyone else has this but
it's like like my drink that I know I
can drink and I won't be ill or won't be
sick like that is vodka okay
vodka does that for me so vodka in
cumbria I love it the minute because
like I say and I love stuff that's sweet
and I've really gone off like fizzy
stuff so I don't like lemonade I mean
I'll have lemonade and then a bit of
like something flavored in it so it's
not just lemonade vodka and orange I
used to have a lot and then it kind of
just made me it started making me feel
sick like when I would have normal
orange juice because it was like in my
head I could like taste the vodka in the
only shoes I don't know if that makes
any sense and I really liked wine at the
minute okay so I never used to drink
wine so I didn't like it but I love the
dry white wine I really like that okay
just min has asked a really difficult
question I feel like this is so top five
things you want to achieve before you're
30 and top five things you want to
achieve before you're 50 oh gosh I don't
know I probably can't think of five on
the spot but I could think of some so
before 30 I would love to have a brand
of some sort so maybe a makeup brand
possibly or just like a brand and that I
can like share with you guys I feel like
that would be really cool to like
actually have my own products um I would
love to own a house by the time that I'm
30 I think that would be like amazing
um I just like have a dream I'm just
having like a beautiful home I would
love to like have my own house and stuff
and be able to decorate and stuff by the
time of day yeah I feel like that would
be so cool I want to say like married
but like not necessarily married just in
like a long-term stable relationship I
feel like I am now anyway obviously but
for that to still be going on by the
time I'm 30 I would love to have
traveled a little bit more I feel like
that's something by the time I'm 50
though I feel like by the time I'm 50
I'd have wanted to travel and seen
everything that I wanted to see I don't
know if I want kids I don't know if
anyone else ever like thinks it is but
I'm not sure if I want kids yeah I know
pain really does I came really wants
kids um I don't know if I do I don't
know I don't know if I see myself being
a mom but I mean does anyone ever I feel
like some people see themselves being a
mom so
live us how do you get a manager wait
how do you get a manager and start to
get paid when doing YouTube does it
happen right at the start or is that a
certain point and I feel like in terms
of getting paid and stuff
definitely doesn't happen from the
get-go so I I don't know I I can't
remember when I started like earning
decent money from YouTube I guess um I
used to like I did it for a hobby for a
really long time and even like Adsense
so like even when I was uploading videos
and getting views and like money through
Adsense like you don't get anything at
the start so I can't remember like I
can't I can't remember what point it was
where I started like earning money from
it but it wasn't for a long time it
wasn't for like over a year I would say
even now like asserts money is not the
best in my opinion I've just unless you
getting like lots and lots of views or
you're uploading lots and lots um I
don't find that it's like the best
source of income and in terms of
management so I got my first management
when it was probably like a year in so
when I had about was it um maybe a
little bit longer like I can remember
when I started like growing problem like
properly it was probably when I reached
about sixty thousand subscribers that I
got my well I signed with my first
management
so my first management was storm and
which is like mostly known as a model
management it's based in London so they
have a section called strong vision
which is more for like influences and TV
personalities and stuff like that and
yeah that was probably about a year in I
actually terminated that contract early
so I was supposed to be with them for a
year and then we both kind of decided to
terminate it early because it's just
like wasn't really working out like
nothing nothing weird or anything it
just like wasn't working and then I was
probably by myself for about eight
months
I'd say before I signed with red hair so
that's who I'm with now and I've been
with red hair for about a year and a
half nearly so yeah it's kind of lot
better
yawns I'm so getting management and
stuff don't think it's something that
you need to do at first because like
like I said there was a
of time in between storm and sign in
we've read hair where I was just like
managing myself and like it was
absolutely fine like I still did it did
I do it full-time yeah I still did it
full-time then and I still like and
money I guess I just managed it all
myself so it was an agent go through
management so Leah asked thoughts on the
law of attraction itself love what's
your star sign and your favorite series
so my star sign is ilio I love being a
Leo I just I love it
in terms of Law of Attraction I do
really believe in that so the first book
that I ever read about that I'm not sure
not finishing it I need to like reread
it and it was the secret and it's
actually on my windowsill behinds but
that was the first book I started
reading about the law of attraction and
I think it's like it's something that I
personally believe in so it's basically
the idea that your energy and your
thoughts and stuff like basically
everything that you like think and all
of your energy and stuff is what you
were trapped so if you're a really
positive person and you basically just
have really positive thoughts and you
really like believe in yourself and just
believe and what you want to do and
start then you'll be like a positive
you'll have a positive and successful
life and if you kind of a bit more of a
negative person and you just mope around
all day and you feel a little bit sorry
for yourself or whatever else that's the
sort of stuff that you'll attract again
so basically your life will be a
reflection of like you as a person and
like your energy in your thoughts and I
believe now I don't think it's like
obviously literal it's in the sense like
if you think something and you have a
certain energy about something it will
come into your life and you kind of have
to like obviously pop work into doing
stuff as well and things like that but I
definitely think it contributes a lot to
the sort of path you end up taking
because I remember when I first started
YouTube and I was just like really I
just really like believed in myself and
I really believed in my channel when I
first started even though I look back my
videos now and absolutely hate them when
I first started in things I was just
like I really believed in what I was
doing and I just was always so excited
to film and I just had this like I just
always felt really positive about my
videos and stuff and then my channel
ended up growing and stuff and I just
feel like with a combination of like
having the right energy and
attitude and then actually putting work
into stuff like you can genuinely
achieve whatever you want to achieve I
have my favorite series so I love
stranger things absolutely love stranger
things I'm waiting for a third series
now I love The Vampire Diaries oh my god
I've just finished it and I was like so
upset genuinely don't think I've ever
cried so much like so heavily like I
actually sobbed at the Vampire Diaries
at the end in I was just so sad but
Alice me and my mom have started
watching Happy Valley because a couple
of people that work recommended it to us
so with two episodes in it's a little
bit dark so far I'm like Jesus
I've always started watching that so
we'll see how that goes let me know if
anyone's watching obviously please don't
spoil it
I hope we've just finished well I didn't
watch the full series but my mom's just
finished finished my chela so I don't
know what channel it's on on TV might be
like BBC ITV but I only watched like the
last few episodes so I kind of like
picked it up and then just watched last
view I think it's the second series I
want to say of much hello I just like I
have no words for that show like it's
just so on a strange level in my opinion
I don't know like the whole ending I
don't want to ruin it obviously for
people who haven't watched it or
whatever I would recommend it because
it's like God but it's just really
twisted like it's really sick yeah the
ending if anyone's watched it okay watch
the end in watch the last episode like
the very end I don't want to say what
happens but like it was just so bizarre
like it's kind of sight self up for a
new series and I get that but like there
was no need for her to do what she did
and just I don't know I can't really say
anything without spoiling it with
anyone's watched it tweet me on Twitter
because it's just it's just something
okay it's something Ariana
asked what's your opinion on the
Madeleine McCann mystery what do you
think happened PS look your loads
I love reaching into like stuff like
this like the whole my dilemma can case
unsolved murders unsolved crimes stuff
like that like if anyone loves things
like that and you don't watch Bella fury
I think it's
named Bella Fury's mystery Mondays you
need to go and watch them like she just
covers everything so well that like some
of my favorite videos as well in a
minute to watch some YouTube I just find
them so interesting and they're just
something a lot bit different from like
normal beauty videos I don't know I
still don't know what to think like I've
run up about air and I've read different
things I think the whole thing is just
so sketchy I think it's really bad there
um her parents Kate
is it Kate and I don't know what her
husband's called Jerry pepper made that
up Kate and Gerry McCann I just think
it's so messed up that they didn't get
locked up for what they did because they
effectively just like left their kids in
the room that's like effectively child
neglect to some level to just leave them
that I'm pretty sure they gave them like
um something to help them sleep and
stuff so that they wouldn't get up and
walk around which that is one theory the
fact that she might have died from
whatever they gave her to help her sleep
and then they just basically covered up
the deaths but only two theories I
actually think possibility is is the
fact that she died in the apartment and
then the parents somehow managed to
cover up her death without anyone
finding out which will just be crazy I
was reading somewhere as well I don't
know if this is true I don't know if any
of this is true by the way so correct me
if I'm wrong because it's been a while
since I read off about all of this but
the fact that when the whole kind of
investigation started instead of her mom
I think she's called Kate kind of
refused to answer a lot of questions and
just wouldn't give answers to stuff
which just makes no sense because if you
kid went missing you'd want to be as
helpful as possible and do as much as
you can to help find her I think she had
that dive in the apartment um and they
somehow managed to cover up the death
which I have no idea how they would
manage to do that but it seems like it
could be a possibility or she was
abducted and then I think even if she
was abducted I don't think she would be
alive now because I think with the
amount of media coverage and stuff if
she had been abducted for in terms of
like human trafficking and stuff I don't
think they would have risked keeping her
alive I don't know I don't know by its
really sad and I hope one day we do get
an answer because the whole thing is
just awful to be honest court asked
would you ever film with a subscribe
yes okay so I keep getting emails like
really random stuff and so I'm actually
getting an office suit and so I think
I've mentioned this on either in some
live or just in a video maybe so I'm
actually getting an office in which I'm
so excited about because filming in this
room like this is my bedroom I'm filming
in here is like so difficult sometimes
because my room is pretty small like
where the camera is now is like the back
wall of my room like that's where my
window is so I'm excited to just like
have some space and have like a separate
workplace because I think that will help
as well with just being able to get out
the house like one thing about doing
YouTube and stuff and working from home
even though it sounds like the best
thing in the world and in some ways it
is the best thing in the world it's just
like so hard sometimes to like either be
motivated enough to actually film or
like do something because you literally
at home or just to feel like I don't
know yeah I just feel like motivated I
feel like sometimes when you got home
you just it's too easy to not be
disciplined so I'm excited to get into
office and I feel like that will then it
give me opportunities to do like more
interesting videos and like maybe invite
some of you guys down I feel like we
could do one day a month maybe or like
two days a month or something where I
invite subscribers down for the day and
we can all just like chill at my office
and chart and then film a video or
something like that
I feel like that'd be really cool if
basically my mom and dad's old office so
for people who don't know my mom and dad
have a graphic design agency and so they
like work together and then they have
like much a bunch of stuff and stuff
which they're all really lovely and it's
their old office they've moved into a
different office now so that place is
basically just vacant at the minute so I
was like oh okay Elizabeth asked this is
really handy and my water bottle here
how much water do you drink in a day so
this is my water well this is one of
them and but both of them are the same
size so this was actually gifted to me I
can't remember who gifted it to me it
was a brand but I absolutely love it
because it says on the front believe
achieve succeed and then it has on the
back and basically like reminders
actually drink water and stuff and it
kind of motivates you to do it so I've
got them toe in it
because I don't like drinking plain
water all the time it's not that I don't
like the taste of it I just find it
really boring and like difficult to
drink so I fill it with bento because
even though it's like not as good for
you at least I'm still getting water if
that makes sense and I drink at least
two of these a day so I try and drink
like as much water as possible because
one thing I found is that when I drink
more water I don't feel as bloated and I
also don't eat as much because a lot of
the time like when you're thirsty and
stuff your body just confuses it for
being hungry and you'll just eat food
and stuff whereas you could just have
some water and you'd be fine so I try
and drink as much as possible because I
feel like I'm less bloated and I don't
eat stuff unnecessarily okay I'm going
to see if there's any more because I'm
gonna wrap it up in a sec so any more
that I like really want to answer
Elizabeth asked have you thought about
bringing out any merch or any cosmetic
products so I do want to have a brand
like I said and I don't think I do like
merch as such because I don't feel like
that's me um but I think I'd want to
have maybe like a brand of some kind and
have a product either like go down the
clothing route or the makeup route I'm
excited of fashion and I love makeup so
I feel like that would be really cool
but it wouldn't be like merch so it
wouldn't like have my name on it and
things because I feel like not everyone
wants something we'd like someone's name
on it like I'd rather design something
that everyone could wear a lot of people
are asking about how to cope with exam
stress and things like that
honestly like I used to hate exams I I
can't even tell you how much I used to
hate exams especially when it got to a
two so the year that Charlie did now
charlie is actually revising for his a2
exams and I feel even worse for him
because they changed it after I left so
that you have to do all of your a-level
exams at the end of a two are not some
at the end of first year and some at the
end of second year I have feel free I
really do and I think there's just like
no way of really like
coping with it as such I think it's just
making sure that you have a balance
between school work and like just relax
in and actually having a life and also
making sure that you start revising and
prep
early enough so that you avoid stress at
the end of the year because I remember
like when I did my air levels GCSEs
weren't so bad like if you do in GCSEs
don't worry as much because obviously
something to put working in things and
they're still important but they're not
as bad as when it gets to a level so a
level was like where I really struggled
and I feel like first year I put in a
lot of work because I really enjoyed my
subjects and I really enjoyed like the
topics that we did in the subjects and
stuff so I found it easy to revise
because I actually was interested in
what I was doing and I just remember
like I gave myself loads of time and I
started like a good few months maybe not
a few months but a good period of time
before my actual exams started and then
in a2 like I just did not want to revise
at all like I was just not motivated I
didn't want to do any of it because I
think by that point I knew I didn't want
to do anything academic I kind of
started youtubing stuff and that's where
my main interest was but it just got to
a point well that was probably about
four weeks before my first exam and I
pretty much just started krumin and it's
just not the way to go like honestly I
can't tell you the amount of times I
cried the amount of times I was just so
beyond stressed out like my mum Glasser
my mum's amazing like she she tried so
hard to help me in things because it got
to a point where I was like like I
actually realized it's sunk in I don't
have a lot of time and I'm probably not
gonna remember a lot of stuff that I
need to know luckily I got really lucky
with lucky with him and a lot of the
stuff that I kind of revised like
towards where my when my actual exams
aware and is what came up on the paper
so I was pretty lucky but I think like
it makes such a big difference actually
given yourself the time and not trying
to cram because that is like stress that
I would not wish on anyone it's awful so
do yourself a favor start working early
on and just don't worry about it one
thing that my mom always used to say to
me is that as long as you do your best
and as long as you've put the work in
and you've actually you know you have
revised and you've actually you know
done the effort to do the work or
whatever else I don't even know what I'm
trying to say but as long as you've made
that
and tried your best it doesn't matter
like what you got is such like because
whatever you got will be a reflection on
your hardware can like you know your
best effort so yeah that always made me
feel better I was like as long as I've
put the working and as long as I've done
my best in the actual exam that's all
you can do and he sums on everything I
know they are to some extent but
honestly just remember that it's like
there's so much more further on like
there's so much more beyond exams I
remember disuse of thinking like exams
were just my life and let you example
the be-all and end-all and then not like
they're really not so just don't put
yourself under too much pressure and
don't crap I learned that the hard way
because I can't even tell you the amount
of times I cried I had used to just sit
there and cry and be like it's gonna be
fine you know it's like mom no I'm gonna
fail I came out with two A's and a B if
anyone's wondering but yeah I'm gonna
leave it there because I've let you been
speaking for over an hour and my voice
is like got to a point where it just
sounds weird now it's my voice get so
excited yeah I hope you enjoyed this let
me know if you enjoyed these kind of
videos because if you like some people
just aren't interested in my try
yourself and would rather see like
makeup and fashion things so let me know
if you enjoy this and let me know what
videos you want to see next because like
I was saying I'm struggling at the
minute I need some help help me out yeah
I'm gonna go so thank you it's so much
for watching I love you guys swimming in
back I can't even speak because like
that song I've been speaking for like my
voice just gives off I love you guys to
the moon and back a million times over
and I'll see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
