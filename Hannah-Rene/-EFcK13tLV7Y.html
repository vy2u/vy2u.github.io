be like the 11th time I've tried to sell
my Stu good how about Tim to get past
like an intro or like get words out or
anything so this video is just going to
be an absolute mass and I'm sorry heard
violence look I want to do it on cut
because that's how I want it like I feel
like the butterfly flutters and the best
way for me to talk about this is pretty
sweet on cut like I've done other videos
in the past because I feel like they're
just the most genuine in my opinion when
you know that you'll just join me like
it just feels more personal and there's
nothing I love more than just sitting
and chat in and it just being like like
this you know so I'm basically here to
have a chat about what happened on
Monday which I'm sure all of you already
know what happened on Monday um but in
Manchester at the m en there was a
bombing / terrorist attack at the I just
said that thing at the MEI at Manchester
Arena at the ariana grande concert and
which actually killed 22 people I
believe I think it's nighttime 138 22
and it injured like hundreds of people
and I was there obviously I'm absolutely
fine thank God but you know I want to
come in here and chat about it because
because it felt like it would have just
been so wrong to like I don't know like
after what happened on Monday the
thought of sitting down and just filming
like a makeup tutorial or clothing haul
it was like irrelevant like completely
irrelevant
okay none of it matters I mean obviously
we enjoy it but in the grand scheme of
things it's just not important and so I
wanted to sit
and Chava I'm sorry I keep looking hair
I feel like my brain is just like all
over the place so I wanted I wanted to
sit down and chat about this and I've
thought about it all week because I've
known I've wanted to but I have so I've
been so nervous to film this because I I
struggle so much to like translate what
is in my head I like to say it the way I
want it to come across if you know what
I mean I don't know if that makes any
sense but I just want it to I don't know
I don't know but one thing I will say is
that I just want to this video all I
want is the comment section to be
positive and supportive I don't want any
 on it like anyone not that any of
you will but you know when a videos been
off a couple of weeks and then you know
someone randomly finds it who's not part
of our little family like I just want to
say if you're that person watching this
comments like that will just be blocked
and deleted
I'm not having any negative is on this
video it's not happening and I want it
both to be completely positive and
supportive because obviously like I know
sorry that was very so dry but I know a
lot of you are from Manchester I know a
lot of you went to the concert like I
did and I know a lot of you I'm sure are
affected in some way by what happened
and I just I won I know for that I'm
going to be reading all of the comments
and I'm like I just want to do anything
I can to help support anyone who is
affected by this or other things in
general but I just
just like
it's just awful um but yeah I just want
everything to be super positive which I
know you guys are like my favorite thing
about this channel is you and I just
want to say like if anyone who's sat
watching this and you are you have been
in some way like affected by what
happened whether it's you were there and
you like me and you go out and you find
what you still feel completely
traumatized by it or if you are there
and you were injured by what happened if
you would if you were not even there but
you have friends or like family or
anyone who is there to to
so crazy to think so but yeah you're
watching isn't your anyway affected by
what happened I don't even know what to
say but I'm like so sorry because it's
 awful I don't even know like I
feel like the first like 10 or 9 times a
film this I've let you sit here and
cried because I've been so upset but now
I'm going to point my spit I get to
point my sleek line on just a few min
like I'm so angry because it's just like
 awful but yeah if there's
anything that you want to share in the
comments if you want to share your story
from it and you want to make yourself
known please do because like we're all
here to help anyone and yeah you know
I'm trying to say we're all here to help
anyone that's not all I want from this
video is for like someone to feel like
they've got support which I'm sure
you've got so much support it is but you
know yeah so and I'm going to sit and
chat about sorry I don't know if you can
hear that as I sirens I'm going to sit
and chat about what happened in my eyes
if that make sense because when I asked
when I said on Twitter like I was gonna
be doing this a couple of people asked
me to explain the night in terms of how
it I saw it happen and so that's what
I'm going to do and then I don't really
know I'm going to see quite after
thatwell Justin see how it goes so um
you asked me and my friend Ellie I went
to the concert with one of my good
friends Ellie who I actually worked with
it marked when I used to work that and I
hadn't seen her in ages it was so lovely
getting to see our and we went together
it was just two of us so I as you guys
know like I live in a flat pretty much
in town now so it was really easy for us
to get there like we literally just get
a taxi you know with that and we did
film I get ready with us but I'm not
flirting anymore for obvious reasons and
I've kept the footage because I feel
like one day I will wanna watch it but
like at the minute I can't like bring
myself to even like edit it or watch it
only thing knowing that like who shot
that in like you know did makin stuff
and we had were just like absolutely be
s like what was going to happen and but
yeah we went to concert we were seated
in block 105 and we got there pretty
late to be honest we almost missed one
of the support acts oh god I can't
remember like one of them was Victoria
this is irrelevant but those two support
acts and and VI anyway so we got that we
were at the concert we sat down it was
incredible like it was so incredible
I've never seen Ariana life before but
Ellie has 76 laps like my tables like
here and only has like she saw I went on
a last tour she's incredible ideas you
know you'll know but like her voice is
incredible it's insane and the show yeah
it was incredible and you could tell
everyone that was just loving it like
everyone had the best time and what was
really nice is like I obviously knew
that there was going to be a like
majority young girls are but you know it
was 19 like like other groups of people
as well I guess like people my my sort
of age in Ellie's age and you know older
and a lot older which I mean obviously a
lot of Parana as well and but like guys
there as well it's just such a nice
atmosphere like I just ah it was it was
incredible it really wasn't you could
tell everyone had an amazing time
I'm sorry I know I keep looking here but
I'm really like I want to make sure that
I like get my words out this time so um
yeah the last shirt the last song that
she did for us was dangerous woman I
don't know she does that for every
single show but the sort of uncle was
dangerous woman and she comes back on
and she does it absolutely incredible uh
she said good night and things and then
she basically leaves the stage but the
music is still playing and the lights
are still off and at this point me
Nellie was kind of like Emma and I were
like do we leave now sort of beat the
rush because where I was like we're
getting a tax about to mine and if
anyone's been at the army I'm you know I
quite like any concert venue in general
hectic getting a taxi so we would like
to leave now and beat the rush and what
do we just wait and it got it got
something like the lights of sapphic
sold-out we're like okay we'll just wait
and so yeah but like I said a lot of
people do want to beat the rush so while
some music was still playing I'd like to
solve a lot of people left it's like
getting it's like feeling like people to
believe in very quickly and and then you
know the music probably carried on for
like another 30 seconds to a minute and
then it stops and the lights came on and
and we haven't just stood there for a
little bit were like okay I'll just wait
until like because we're in the middle
of row like okay we'll just wait until I
everyone kind of like maids away out
onto the says and then we got into the
stairwell that kind of joins 105 of 106
so when you kind of like when you walk
up that one you're pretty much at
Victoria Station exit and the one next
lot is pretty much the exit that is
Victoria Station and so yeah we were
basically on the stairs and we started
we started walking up and then that was
when we heard the bang and when I think
back to some of this knowledge it's such
a blur because it all just happens so
quickly but we heard the bang
obviously the music had stopped the
lights would come on it's probably about
two or three minutes after that
and um and everyone just kind of like
start for like a second you not me like
you had a bang and you look in the
direction of worries which was it was
like that something sense like up in
front of other bloggers and and then
literally a second later people just
started flooding like full or Davis back
into the arena like I've never seen it
like screaming you know it absolutely
terrified and I is gonna sound so stupid
but I feel like I was the only person
who stood there who genuinely it didn't
even like cross my mind but it was a
bomb it sounds so stupid but I genuinely
said that and I thought a speaker blown
that was my initial thought when I heard
the bang because in my head I'm like
okay the music's just gonna they
probably just switched like whatever
sounds jealous I don't know but my own
my initial thought was that I speakers
blown and that is what I create the band
and then I basically saw the people I
panicked because it's natural to panic
when you hear a loud bang if that makes
sense I have been like a chain reaction
where one throws in a panic and then
another mess and panicked and then you
know you've got everyone running back in
and when I feel like people are running
back in if you've been in the Army on
like you know the stairs to like go out
and like walk up different like blocks
and stuff that's steep and there are no
handrails and going after there's a lot
of kids in there's a lot of small
children and stuff and people were just
getting trampled on like people so
frantic to get back into the arena that
kid like it was just chaos absolute
chaos and and you know obvious like as
people put in buttons like our stairwell
as well for me and Ali went back onto a
row because there's nowhere else unless
you want to like go down the stairs or
get pushed down the stairs we were like
get onto a row so we just stood there
and I feel like we were just stood there
for like a minute also looking around
like what the is going on like what
is this um
I feel like at this point like this is
what kind of feels like a bit of a blur
but I mean people must have just been
making their way like I've seen a couple
of videos on Twitter and stuff because
alarms have been keeping up with that on
social media and I've seen a couple of
videos of people just like piling into
the downstairs like the floor exits
obviously of your on the floor you've
got a different exit to like other
people in the blocks and like the chairs
and stuff and there's kids like this
girls just try to like though this was
like forcing themselves over the top of
like rails and jumping down like
everyone was just trying so desperately
to like get out of another exit if I
make sense um I feel like mean alley we
just stood there like I don't even
remember Ellie seen anything like she
was just I don't I don't know if she did
say something I just I was just like
oblivious because I would remember I
don't remember saying anything she was
just just there with me and we were
literally just looking around like what
is this I what is going on and I
remember these two girls and them so
discreetly and they look like sisters he
looks quite young the youngest looks
maybe like 13 or 14 and then I I think
was her older sister was with her and
the younger one was like freaking out
like following like having a panic
attack and at this point I generally
just still think it was sorry my voice
is like like but I genuinely did still
think it was like a speaker or something
because you know what it's just like I
sure know this is me which didn't it's
doesn't the M en is some weather I've
always felt so safe so that would never
be the first thing that I would that
would never be the first thing that my
mind don't stare something so it's
because I've been that go-to times it's
somewhere I feel so safe Manchester in
general I just feel safe here
I don't know what it is I just i sticked
it in like I heard you know I was saying
I was saying this garlic don't worry
it's fine like people are panicking
because Naturals panic it's gonna be
absolutely fine an assistant was saying
the same she was like yeah don't worry
other than she was what I think is a
sister obviously she wants to calm it
down as well but we were just to deal
with them like no don't worry it's gonna
be fine and then Ellie was kind of like
because I'm obviously like I mean at
least look like after and Ellie you
think it was like a bomb that was hurt
but then she said like as I started
saying it she was like yes I would speak
out saying like you know because I was
so adamant like don't worry it's fine
and then the next thing that happens is
a guy comes onstage
so obviously the lights still on and so
people are still trying to like run out
and a man comes on stage and Elly
believes this could have been someone
from Ariana's like team because she
thinks he was American but someone I am
but at this point I was just not um I
feel like this is when I started like my
mind just like again I'm just like a bit
blurred I don't remember him have an
accent I don't know who he was but yeah
I got a man comes on stage with a
microphone honey basically start saying
everyone calm down there's two things I
remember him saying really clearly
because obviously I'm trying to convince
everyone to calm down and the two things
disgu I said she goes calm down there's
not a problem
and he goes take your time leave in so
obviously I'm thinking right exactly
it's absolutely fine he's saying himself
you know this guy's got on stage and
said it's fine there's no problem take
your time to leave so I'm unless you
stood there with Elliott news mm like
look it's fine it's gonna be absolutely
fine and and then I feel like at that
point like we've probably been to a day
like five ten minutes like five minutes
or so and then after he said that Nicole
on stage I said to her like look it's 5
so we dislike we'd walked because we
come back onto a row we'd walk to the
stairwell that's next to us that joins
105 with 104 and and then that's nuts
gala was pretty clear by then flu-like
right okay let's make our way up so we
went to start walking up again these two
girls are still behind us I don't even
know where they ended up obviously like
obviously they must be fine and but it
was at that point I like I said the
seller wasn't as busy people were just
walking down at this plane from like
where it happened and a woman walked
past and she just said she was it was a
bomb and she just says it and I feel
like that's when I
like okay so like but she walked past
and she said it and Ellie looked to me
and we sort of looked at each of that
and she was obviously she wasn't even
shout and she was just distraught she
just like she said it quietly if you
know I mean because she was so upset I
just look to LA and I was like no
 way because I still like I don't
know what it was like my mind was just
like this is not happening this is not
happening
so I mean Ali's done that and we're like
I like absolutely not
I'm like this is not happening Ellie
doesn't really say anything because
obviously like speaking to afterwards
she thought it was anyway and but I mean
at this point like like I said the cell
was still pretty quiet so we walk up
after this guy is like they said like
take your time with yourself we walk up
the stairs that is the block the
stairwell away from so it's a bit
further away from Victoria Station like
the area where it happened like the
Victoria Station exit and I not just let
you walk upstairs and you go through
like the corridor if anyone's been in
the Army in like you know you walk
through like the corridor and then you
come out and do it in like the for you
with like the most friends and stuff and
I think that seems like it actually like
it still did like sink in well obviously
that's when I knew because we watts ow
and we walked out like we didn't run we
just walked out and then we see sorry
next picture this microphone then we see
all the people panicking screaming
crying and I look to the left of me like
super briefly because there is a guy as
a guy just shout in row and I look to
the left of me super briefly and that's
when I saw the doors that exit out to
the Victoria Station as it and I saw
what I thought was like when I saw it
like I thought it was like grounds that
I've been turned up if that makes sense
because I'm pretty sure like I'm not
seeing where this is in consent or if
it's been confirmed or whatever but I'm
pretty sure this happened actually
outside
as like the arena and I'm pretty sure it
happened like where that exit is and you
have like a box not who said they used
to be a McDonald's there and it's quite
an open space it's quite a big space and
and I'm pretty short because a lot of
people on social media were like how did
this guy get in or like why word bags
checked or bla bla bla bla bla this guy
did not get in he was not letting to
Syria from what I understand and what I
believe I he was not at the concert you
know like he didn't in his hopper ticket
didn't go into the arena anyone can wait
there there was parents were in that
there was people to stand in their way
and sneak up with friends like obviously
it was busy exert all of the mothers
like three of them that I think of
through three exits but he wasn't
letting to the arena anyone this is what
the worst part is because when I started
to think about it I was like this could
not even how could this have been
prevented because you can't blame the
NBN because I'm pretty sure they did not
let him in he was just waiting that is
so second in but he was just
wait in there in a space where anyone
can be and he set that bomb off
obviously at a time when it's busiest
when people when people are just
streaming out and trying to get home um
so yeah I look to the left of me and
match this website I like to look for a
second and I saw I thought was like
tearing up ground and that's when we
just started running like me and Ally
grabbed it to the tons and we just run
like for their exit that is to the right
so you walk around for a bit although we
were like running around and then you've
got the I don't know what the name is of
that except but it's like the big exit
that got all the stairs going down and
it was all just so it all just happened
so quickly and I remember walking out
I've got over there and there was like
shoes just like randomly scattered like
people are just dropped like heels and
stuff and I was like
spots of blood like it's so disgusted
like is so horrible to think about but
there was just like spots of blood
missing shoes people had obviously just
started running and
and then you got we got down the stairs
and those already ambulances police cars
everything ah the exit because basically
that road followed round and that is
where Victoria Station is the exits are
pretty close there was already
ambulances the police cars you could
have the sirens you could see the ladies
it was like madness people just
screaming crying everything and we just
like we would like walk we just started
walking running walking we just like get
away which like it's one of the things
that I kind of like I don't feel bad
about bye Mike could we have like helped
people like because I was like it went
off and nothing else happened not that
we were to know that you know for
everyone else knew that something else
was going to happen but like now when
you think about it it's like could you
like help people job I don't know like
you just start thinking right on it so
it's just so strange but yeah we
literally mean ally describe each other
it was just two of us and we just we got
away as quick as we could and we started
walking along past where we just started
walking the route of how the taxi takes
us from here to there and and it was
like madness it was absolutely - it was
chaos and we started walking we walk
past like like the chandelier like shot
which again if I know has been that you
know like if this shot was just always
lit up just full of lights and there's a
lot of people obviously like wait in
there there was people on the phone
China this was like the worst part
because obviously so many parents were
there with their kids and you would just
hear like parents scream in their kids
names because their kids had obviously
we were not so scared and like everyone
like we were so lucky so it was just two
of us and we just stuck together and we
had each other because genuinely like
the panic people just run and then
before you know it you know you
obviously seen there was like hotels
taking kids in those all sorts like it
was madness
and and we just started walk-in and we
just watch and watch them walk until we
were like as like far away from it as
possible to the point where that was
basically no you know no people no
traffic as such and then that's when we
got an uber and just got the rest of the
way home and but yeah I actually bumped
into the subscriber um I'm pretty sure
she's called Megan I'm sure she's called
Megan she was tweeting me all night and
and she came up to me and I saw her I
was like I recognized her because I
recognize anyone here and tweets me a
lot I'm sure she was called Megan um but
yeah she lost a friend so we waited with
her and that's when I called my mom and
like like me and Ellie like we wanted to
call like our mom straight away because
there's nothing worse and like I feel
like there's nothing worse than seeing
something on social media or other news
and knowing like your kids that or
knowing like someone you know is there
I'm not I'm seeing it that before you
hear it from them is that make sense we
were like we want to drink like we're
and our moms so that they knew before
they saw anything and I remember one
month picking up and like she must have
it was because Doug was there as well
and I told her what happened and she was
literally as shocked as I was and she
was like honey just like gather as
quickly as you can like do what you
can't do just get you an ally out so we
waited with Megan I finally turned up
I'm sure she's called Megan Megan if you
if you're watching this and you need
something again I was so sorry but I'm
sure she's called Megan and her friends
turned up and then we laughed I'm like
oh I've been speaking of 27 minutes
already Jesus Christ if cameras going to
cut off in a minute and and then that's
when we actually like I said we just
watch and watch and watch until it was
basically Lewis basically no on that and
we got in a taxi and we we thought the
rest of the way home and then we came up
and I love something like a lot of my a
lot of a lot of people at um obviously
been texting and messaging like people
who knew a lot of you been sweet and
obviously people that are known that we
were there just like are you okay are
you safe
are you out there like what situations
Allah and which is one I like tweeted
saying that we were fine because I
wanted to let you all know that we were
fine but by that point by the time we've
got home like I didn't have words like
all I kept saying to Ellie was like I
can't believe this I couldn't believe it
I was just like um so yeah we message
everyone back and then we we literally
sat with outside on like the terrace
area because my flat I was like a
terrace area and it's quite high up and
it's quite you can see a lot from it
and all you could see was like sirens
police cars you know they must have
called like everyone in Gion me from
like all places around Manchester and
that's like that I thought it was that
last night we just sat there and we kind
of just liked which is kind of like sat
in silence and then so I'll grow it and
then start and tie it to a bit more we
must have gotten at about twelve I would
say the concert finish at half time we
must have gotten at about twelve and I
just can't like explain the shock a bit
like
this is crazy we was like all of us me
and Ellie and every one of the hookah
out okay we are like the luckiest people
that's all I keep thinking like we are
so lucky it's like I feel bad when I
start going upset about it because I'm
like I genuinely don't have anything to
be upset about like I'm fine and Ellie
fine and everyone who I know who when is
fine whereas some people aren't find and
I think that's like when I get upset law
but then I'm like an ointment on my hand
why isn't upset because like obvious
like it's okay to be upset when you like
you've been in a situation like that
this come Aswad I'm going to switch the
battery and I'm going to switch in acts
which is going to cut off giving like
two seconds all right sorry my phone
goes off I feel awful because that
Rosie's supposed to come around and she
was like I was it's now 9:00 like she's
supposed to be here and I might earth
since like my time goes off anyway and
what was the pain yes so we got home and
and we just fat I'm we literally we just
I feel like it was just like still in
shock like we genuinely thought that I
didn't cry once when we got home I just
sat that I like my but I felt like I was
just still processing at all I was like
watching it on Twitter because like as
well we were just like literally sat on
social media keeping it because
obviously it was it was um it was
reportage about very quickly obviously
and I feel like it was very quick
Rosie like give me two seconds all right
came back sorry this is like this is
because I've just taken so long to film
this video I can't even explain like
this well so well
that what was I saying I feel like dying
from dark words on over that summer yeah
we got we got in and like I said we were
chatting and stuff and then we kind of
got into bed but we we were like so
drained because being a concert we
hadn't really eaten any time we had we
had nothing to see nothing Medina by
this time it's like 12:00 at night and
like physically we were just going right
emotionally were so drained but we just
couldn't sleep like we were just so
awake I was like to sit in on social
media refreshing keeping up with what's
happening and we didn't sleep until 3:00
so we got in at 12:00 we probably went
to bed about we probably actually got
into bed at about 2:00 and we actually
did fall asleep until 3:00 and and it
was so strange like falling asleep
because it's always it's like strange
falinda sleep knowing that like
somewhere where you've just been there's
people who were trying to get home just
like you where that that I'm no longer
alive if you know I mean I just one
thing I didn't want this video I wanted
I just don't miss videos feel like it's
like I'm making the situation about me
because I'm not like I this is what I
mean like I don't I feel bad like I
don't feel bad feeling upset about but I
have nothing to be upset about compared
to other people and I know you guys know
that but I just don't is this is one
thing I was like nervous to felt like
nervous to just speak about this because
I don't want to seem like I'm making
this situation about me because it's not
you know I mean like it's about it's
about the whole it's just about
everything and it's mostly about the
people who were like you have lost
family friends and the people who aren't
here anymore
and
but like it was just so strange it was
on it it's honestly just heartbreaking
it really is and I cannot imagine what
because it's like when stuff like this
happens I feel like it's natural to like
put yourself in their shoes or like
imagine what it had been like if it was
you like and it's just natural to like
you don't mean think of like what you
need to be feeling right now if you're
at the worst if you were some of these
points well the people are and I
physically just kind of imagine it like
it's so it's past any form of pain like
it must I don't know but it must be past
like any form of pain that any like you
could ever feel and it's just
awful it really is like it ah just makes
me so angry
and but I mean I feel like the amount of
like support and stuff that was comethis
um in Manchester like I'm so proud to be
from Manchester I'm so proud to be Munk
Union because majority of people here
99% of people here are good people with
good intentions who will do anything for
anyone if you know I mean and like
seeing the support and the way like
every one of the community has like
responded to this and what has been done
and you know like um just everything is
like happened since like it just makes
me so proud and I just hope that it
helps the people who have been seriously
affected by this because it's just it
you can't imagine it you don't mean you
can't physically imagine what it feels
like and and you can't stick to either
that's like the worst part that you
can't even like you can't fix it because
fixing it would be like bringing people
back and you can't do that it's like
such a situation and I just can't
imagine what you know I mean
and but yeah that is pretty much what
happened that that is what happened from
my eyes and how I saw all the events
unfold and I mean like I said if you
happy with that and you have like your
own story and your experience from it
like and you want to share it please do
because we - oh we're all here to help
everyone
well-hit stuff this is just one video
where I just want everyone's like if you
want to just sit and pour your heart out
about do it like we're all here to like
help everyone and I just wish I could
like I wish we could all just like to
help and like fix it you know we hung
and but honestly yeah I just feel so
lucky like so lucky that we got out and
we were okay and we're fine fine it's
like not in it not injured we didn't you
know because it's it's also a lot like
the people that witnessed it and like
fizz like saw what what happened and you
know that must be so like I don't even
know I just got the brain Carrboro so
that you can't imagine it you really
can't and and but yeah that is what
happened from my point of view and
but the wheat like the we that's
followed has been so strange because I
had to be up at 5:00 on Tuesday like I
said like we went to bed about 3:00 and
actually has to be up at 5:00 because I
had a shoot that had been planned for
like a week or so and and it was so
strange like wait keep like obviously we
set alarms like Ellie stood in mine and
we both got up at 5:00 and we set alarms
and it was so strange waking up because
it was so still considering like what it
had been like the night before where
it's just absolute chaos and like sirens
everywhere like it was so quiet like we
both we both just welcomed when without
knowing it was everything was like still
and like it's kind of like when you sit
there and I think that's when we both
started to like actually process what
had happened and because like I said I
went on the shoot and I had to get a
train to London and from Piccadilly and
I got a text yet a half 5:00 in the
morning
was it a half I about six half I don't
know I had a very early train and like
getting a cat food to Piccadilly like
seeing not obviously like getting to
Piccadilly the amount of police that
were there because I like compared to
what it usually is not mean and I think
that's when you start to realize like
the mind begins to realize that this
actually happened and like I can't
explain it but you should start to
realize like what has actually happened
and because yeah honestly the amount of
police at Piccadilly that morning was
crazy like I go there are lots to travel
to unknown another to displease there
like this you'll see police in Chaves
administered like just for safety and
security but compared to like what it
usually is obviously it was far more and
then I just like sat on the train and
that's when I began to like get upset
like I hadn't I I would I would looked
at but it was more in shock like the
night before and I feel like that's when
I started to go upset because I felt so
guilty like just going about my day
it sounds so stupid but like I was just
not on the train and I was like people
literally died like
like I'm literally stuck sat on the
train like go into work technically like
going to do a job like I felt you feel
like guilty I don't know if anyone else
felt like that but it's like you just
feel guilty like going about your day
and going about your life when other
people right now I'm not doing that
because they've already got the kids
that are missing they've just lost
someone it's crazy
it really is crazy and and you know it I
don't know what the solution is to any
of this because in like the grand scheme
of things this happens way too often
waste often all over the world you know
not just in my chest not just in the UK
everywhere
this happens because I mean I feel like
this past week I've just been seeing
more and more things on Twitter in other
places of the world where similar things
are happening and I do not know what the
solution is but we need one I it's so
hard because when I think about it I'm
like what could we have done to prevent
now and I'm pretty sure like from what
I've read the man who actually carried
out that attack was known to be
suspicious or he was on a watch list or
some n like police I'm pretty sure I
mean correct me if I'm wrong but I'm
pretty sure police or something like
some like he was being touched an eye on
if that make sense but he was known to
be suspicious or I don't know I don't
know the way this but yeah he was known
to be suspicious and shady and I just
think like like if we know that why they
just like living in a house like going
about his life I don't know because I
mean no one is to play in front of this
except him but I think is that something
that could have maybe helped prevent a I
don't know that kind of it this is the
thing like I don't I don't know I'm not
saying that like something should have
been done but
it's so hard because I don't like what
the solution is but like things like
this can't keep hopping in you just feel
like so users like so useless because
what happened on Monday Jenny like it
happened to innocent people and normal
people like young girls boys parents
waiting for their kids to come out
literally just people and which is what
it always is
when it sings like this I don't know
like how we fix it the world's just like
that I was behind I don't know
I'm sorry that like it's liquor it and
but yeah I tweeted on my name basically
saying that we're safe and stuff and
then I felt like since then I'm just not
knowing what to say because this is
another thing I feel like this obviously
see things like this that happened so
often but I feel like you never really
like um I don't know how I don't want to
like I don't know how to explain it
without it coming out wrong but I feel
like when you see something happen on
social media and on the news and stuff
in a place that you don't know or a
place it you know you it's not your home
you don't live there you probably never
maybe never been there you don't know
anyone that's been affected by it and
you feel like that's like a.j or
whatever you feel like
upset however long you see it and then
it's kind of like you just carry on
going about your life and things whereas
it's like actually being there and it
being in your home it's like so
different I'm not saying like we
shouldn't earn because I was like we
have to like just carry on is just what
I'm not trying to say it's just strange
I guess it was like weird when like I'm
telling you right and others I know a
lot of people are still thinking right
well then we're all so carrying on I
don't know what it is like it's like you
have is that you have to just accept it
if you know what I mean but you don't
when you finn there you don't want to
accept it like like no like what would
be cut fix it I didn't know I'm trying
to say I really don't know
it's awful all right like I said I do
not know the solution but we need one we
really do
but yeah that that is what happened and
then I was at that shoot on Tuesday that
was hard because I feel like um I got
that I just burst I just cried because
like my body hadn't accepted it yet and
then I was like I realized I feel like I
feel like when I was starting the
training and I was by myself like it was
different when I was with Ellen we were
told about it with them when I was by
ourselves I really began to like think
about it because then it was like I
started to replay what happened in my
head but with what I've actually
happened if I make sense so obviously
when the bomb went off I don't like the
board a bomb went off and we heard the
bang and then people started putting in
I didn't think I don't know I didn't
think anything of it but I thought it
was a speaker so then when I like sort
of relive that in my head and I realized
like no that was genuine terror because
people had literally just seen that then
that's really like whoa if you're not I
mean awful I don't even know how to like
I don't even know what to say I don't
but yeah Tuesday I was asleep and not
myself
but luckily like the people that I was
on a shoot we were amazing they were so
good it's like I just felt bad being
that because every time I sit down and
look at my phone and see what was
happening out that I should be a man
just like I don't know what I should be
doing but I should be doing something I
shouldn't just be here like I so change
and and then Wednesday Wednesday was a
weird day as well Wednesday was just
like 50 times vicki was it was odd
well and I just I actually went to Ibiza
on Thursday I've actually been away
Thursday today I flew home today and
again like I've not put anything about
on my social media because like I felt
guilty being there again I was like I'm
literally on holiday like I just felt
like bad being mad at times like because
I I really enjoyed myself because I was
we don't like a lot of the girls from
red hair and I just in my beta and
having an amazing time with an amazing
brand and stuff and I feel like that was
the first time that had like proper fun
or week after what happened but that has
I feel like bad for like like I just
felt guilty I know the times where I
just sit down I just feel like I feel
like you just could you it's like when
you're there and you've got you just
like you do is to open it's like a
distraction and then you sit down in it
like start thinking about it again
anything that one what everyone was
going through hours of like I've lost
people and things and what they must be
like doing right now and I'm like on
holiday which I'm not complaining like
at all because it was amazing the trip
it was fab but that's I didn't totally
get unlike socials and stuff because I
wanted to like sit here in chapters and
I wanted to like you know I wanted to
get it all like how I guess and I don't
how to end it I don't know if like said
things the way I wanted them to come out
I don't know I'm so hot now
but I mean honestly we really were so
lucky all of us that got out okay we're
so lucky
um like I said if anyone like needs any
supporting any form please like and you
want to make yourself known in the
comments please do don't feel like you
have to like I know there's some people
you won't want to talk about it and
won't want to make themselves now but if
you do like please like you know please
do because like I want my channel my
channel always has been always will be
like a good place and a place where you
can like okay so you can just say what
you want to say and like ask for now
just that's just a place where you can
like you know talk about doors and tell
say how you feel it in things in that's
what it's always been and that's like
why I always wanted to be so how much
finishes I've written I must have been
filming for an hour now and would over
an hour is really are usually are an
hour anyway I hope I just like said
everything in like I don't want to say
the right way but like in a way that
like gets everything across the way it
is in my head
and yeah like I said videos will be as
of normal next week and as of now and
but I just wanted to make this video I
don't really know like I think it's the
right thing to do I think it's what I
think it's the right thing to do and I
think it's an amazing place even though
this is happened like Manchester is an
incredible place and I just like the
support and stuff that people have been
shown because of this like it just makes
me feel proud and I guess like that
makes you feel you know no but yeah I
should probably go up so much as that I
like doing nothing but I love you guys

you still watching like I don't know
just what like but yeah I love you guys
