to be a chatty on a cop video because I
feel like it's been it so long since
I've done one of these I've got like two
on my channel and I think I've got two
I've done like two of these kind of
videos before I just like sit and chat
and don't like edit it or anything just
put the whole thing up on YouTube and
and you all really seem to like them so
I thought I would do another one because
I did plan on doing a haul today the
stuff has literally just arrived and I
was gonna do a haul where sorry don't
mind me hm I bought a bunch of stuff
from romwe I don't know if that's how
you say it but it's like a brand that's
I think it's from I think its American
brand and but it's like super
inexpensive and super cheap and I always
see it advertised everywhere so I bought
a bunch of stuff from that and I was
gonna like try on and do a haul and
stuff and like test it and but this
stuff's only just arrived so I like cuz
hauls take me so long to film I knew
that I wasn't gonna have time to edit
and film it and do all of that stuff in
time for today so I decided to just sit
down and do like a stripped-down kind of
video instead and answer some questions
and like chat about some topics and
stuff that you've mentioned on Twitter
so that is what I'm gonna do and I've
got my little list here I always had my
little list on my phone so that I know
let's talk about because we all know me
I can Rumble for like god knows how long
and so yeah that's what this videos can
envy and yeah it's gonna be on caught I
always start freaking out when I have
like breaks I'm not speaking because I
know that I'm not gonna be able to put
it out well I'm just gonna start I guess
so if you enjoyed these videos then let
me know in the comments down below if
you've got any questions or anything
that you want to talk about and as we go
along
obviously comment down below because I
always love like the comments section in
these videos I feel like everyone's
everyone gets really chatty and stuff
and but yeah that's what today's video
is gonna be I'm gonna start anyways I'm
actually just rumbling and but the first
thing that people meant well one of the
things that people mentioned on Twitter
which is the first thing I've put on the
list is all about like me moving home
what it was like living alone in the
flat don't mind my hair today by the way
I actually just looked like a tail but
it's fine
but yeah living alone in the flat moving
home how I felt since I move home what
it was like living by myself and also
like the weird experiences I had
living in the flat because if anyone
follows me on Twitter I basically like I
don't even know explain it but I just
had a couple of things that were kind of
creepy like I don't even want to say
paranormal stuff but you know when you
just like creeped out by stuff I've
never had that happen to me before in my
whole life but it happened in the flat a
couple of times now just like Oh what is
going on so I'm gonna have like a chat
about that first
so in terms of living in the flat by
myself
and I feel like that some people don't
even know that I moved home like when I
last uploaded my room tour which was my
last video and a couple of people
commented saying like I didn't realize
you'd move home I thought you lived in
the flat
oh Allah so I am at home now this is
like my bedroom at home this is like
where I started my youtube channel I'm
so happy to be back here just because I
feel like I don't know I feel more
comfortable at home like there is no
place like home as we all know and I
like being with my family I like being
around people
I didn't realize like the thing was when
I first moved out and originally I moved
out because I wanted more space I think
a couple people know that and but this
bedroom is pretty much what I do
everything so I film in here I sleep in
here I literally do everything in here
and it just felt it got to a point where
it just felt like claustrophobic if that
makes sense like because if you work at
home like it kind of just feel a bit
claustrophobic at times anyway and and
it got to the point where just like I
feel claustrophobic I feel a little bit
trapped in my little room and I wanted a
flat and stuff where I could have like a
separate room for filming and things so
I moved out and did all of that rented I
only rented for six months I just just
specifically asked for a six month
contract because I kind of knew that I
was like I knew that I wanted to move
out but I was like I'm not gonna like it
I'm gonna am I gonna not like it so I
did six months really good things to do
if you are moving off the first family
not sure um and yeah it lived in there
for six months it was it was alright I
love the flat like I absolutely loved
the flat and I wish I'd like now that
I'm home I wish I'd take him off oh it
was that and done more filming like in
the flat and things and just made more
use of the space because I kind of
stopped so like one to kind of setups I
had like
that was the it was in my living room
and it was like with my clothes and rail
and then I had this out that was in the
filming room which was like the sequin
backdrop which I don't really use
anymore just because it's not room for
at home and but yeah I kind of wish that
made more use of it because the flight
itself was so beautiful like it was
stunning
and but I didn't know I just I don't
know I felt weird living by myself like
that first I loved it but then it got to
a point where I just didn't like being
by myself I thought I would because when
I'm at home anyway a lot at the time I
am on my own because everyone goes to
work or child goes to school pretty much
all day I'm like in the house by myself
so I just assumed that be fine and stuff
and that I'd enjoy it and I'd enjoy the
space which I did I absolutely love the
space and but yeah I kind of just miss
like in the evenings or people come home
and sitting down and chatting and
watching TV together like me and mom and
dad watched lots of like programs and
stuff together which obviously I didn't
have any like anyone to do that way that
the flat and it got to the point where
my boyfriend Kane I would literally ask
him to come around all the time
because I just like didn't like being by
myself I could just I didn't enjoy it
and which is fine like I'm glad that I
did it because it's one of those things
that you have to move out to know that
you don't like it if that makes sense
and that's pretty much why I moved home
just because I just didn't I didn't
enjoy it as much the hell I did and plus
like Brennan is kind of like wasted
money anyway and so hopefully when I
next move out which I don't know when
our next move out I feel like it'll be I
don't know it's hard to say because life
just takes you by surprise all the time
and but hopefully it'll be like a couple
of years I guess I don't really know I'm
not entirely sure we'll just see how
things go but hopefully when I do move
out it will be with a friend or my
boyfriend or just someone because I
can't ever see like myself living by
myself again it's hard work as well like
keeping the whole place clean all the
time and I don't know it's just it's
just a lot like it's just a lot to do
it's a lot of responsibility but at the
same time it is nice to like have your
own space and go out when you want and
come home when you want and do what you
want eat when you want literally do
whatever you want and but yeah that is
like what it was like living by myself
I guess I hope that answers questions
because people do ask sometimes like
what's it like living on your own and I
mean it is fun at times as well I'm not
gonna lie like I had some really fun
times in the flat but overall it was
just a bit like lonely for me so that's
why I moved home and then since I've
been home and I do feel a lot better I
feel a lot more comfortable and yeah I'm
enjoying it so far it's been a month and
a half I moved home at the end of August
and so far I'm loving it so yeah I'm
back in my room I don't really know what
I'm gonna do about bat chops yet because
basically if anyone who watched my room
tour I have this area here which is kind
of like part of the long desk where I've
got like my mirrors and my makeup and I
was going to use that as a filming like
a backdrop of makeup cuz I'm not got the
cecum sequin horn anymore as I said um
but I don't know I can't seem to get it
to look good so I don't really know what
to do yet that's why I'm not filmed a
makeup video well apart from the phone
to you on which I did take down by the
way I private today because I just ended
up being like not happy with the video
and but yeah I need to work I need to I
don't find a way to make this work or
I'm gonna use this space
that's the only thing because now again
like filming in here again there's only
like limited space and stuff and it just
didn't work when I went to film there so
that's the only thing that was a bit of
a sidetrack um oh yeah and then the
other stuffs like they're kind of like I
don't want to call it like call it
paranormal stuff but the weird stuff
that happened in the flat I'm not even
gonna make a separate video on this
because some people like do a story time
on itself and it's not even worth of
story time because it's not even that
interesting but I'll tell you in this
video and so yeah basically I get
shipped up really easily like easily
anyway I get so scared like I can not
watch horror films by myself I just
don't like it if I go and see your
horror film I have to stay with whoever
I've seen the film with the same night
like I'm just such a little shit like I
can't do it and and like I don't know
it's weird because the flat was brand
new and I was a first ever person to
live in my flat because literally the
block had pretty much just been bail and
it like it wasn't even fair
or anything when I moved in so there's
no way that it could have been like I
don't know like haunted or anything but
there was two occasions I'm pretty sure
those three but when I was reading this
question I could only think of two off
the time I had some we're just going to
explain the two and they're not even
that like weird but they weren't for me
at the time because I was literally like
what the hell because as I said I live
by myself as well like I got freaked out
so easily
um but oh no there was three the third
was of Milly and it was the worst one
right okay so first one and I'm so glad
I remembered that because the first two
were pretty boring but the first one I
which one was it
so basically I was in bed and it was
late at night and the way my flat was
set out it's like I have my main bedroom
and then I had like a hallway which went
into the living room and then also like
the bathroom in the second bedroom um
and it was about 12 o'clock at night
came was on his way around because he
was coming over to stay um and sorry I
feel like I'm speaking so quickly in
this video and but yeah Kim was always
way around and I was sat in bed like
just minding my own business and stuff I
had all the lights off obviously it was
like late at night and I had the London
light on because and sometimes the door
be locked him gonna have to like go
downstairs and like kanan or whoever was
coming around in and stuff like that so
the light was on in the hallway and like
all of a sudden I was just sat in bed
and I just looked out into the hallway
and like a shadow like moved across the
door I was just like what the hell was
that
so it's weird because it's like I know I
saw it but it just still confuses me
like I was actually something bad and I
looked out into the hallway and like a
shadow just winding it from like one
side of the door to the other like he
just went dark and he went across and
then it was just like normal again
literally as if like someone had walked
past the door so I was sat in bed and I
saw it and you know it's like it's one
of those things where it's like I know
that I saw her and it's freaked me out
even though you know nothing's going on
it's just normal again so it's like
she's satting bad I did not move from
bed until King got around and then
luckily the door and stuff was open so I
literally
stayed in bed and Saleem
madura lemon but that was the first
thing I don't remember seeing it and I
was like I've never seen anything like
that happened before it really freaked
me out
um what I kind of put it down to my head
afterwards was like you know like
because the lights no we were like
spotlight lights so they were like in
the ceiling if that makes sense there
were like little circle lights in the
ceiling so I kind of in my head I just
thought maybe like a bug flew past and
it cast like a shadow that went across
like as it was flying I don't know
that's why I put that down too because I
was just like what the hell was that
like I don't even I don't know it
completely creeped me out and then the
second one they actually got worse and
worse right so number two um basically
it was in the day this time and I was
sat again in my bedroom and I was at the
bottom of my bed so I was like sat on
the floor leaning against like the back
of like the bottom of my bed and and
yeah it was midday and stuff all like no
lights run and stuff because my flat was
really light I had like a sliding doors
all the way around and basically I heard
something like move or like click on my
bed like as if someone was sat in my bed
and they were like doing something and
they made a noise I can't know what the
noise was exactly but it wasn't like
anything crazy I turned around in office
there was nothing there so I just
carried on minding my business I love my
phone at this time and uh I don't know I
just put it down to like something must
have just moved in a drawer or like I
don't know things just like make noises
all the time I feel like so I just
didn't think anything of it and then
about 10 seconds later literally 10
seconds later I was sat just like stole
my phone and stuff absolutely fine it
was like something was next to me or
behind me and I it was growling it was
so weird there was like this really
low-pitched growl
I can't even like I'm not even gonna try
and do the noise because I know I won't
be able to but it was like it's a longer
set next to me or behind me and like
looking over my shoulder and was like
growling and at that point I was so
freaked out so freaked out I remember
looking and then obviously there was
nothing there so I literally sat out on
my phone and I was like I don't even
know what to do at this point
because I didn't wanna hide get up or
move like
scared something would happen like the
door would slam or something would
happen so I sat down on my phone and I
must have sat there for about 20 minutes
before I actually got the courage to
like get hob go and look around the flat
I don't even know what I thought I was
gonna find but I kind of just got off
and started looking around the flat
thinking I don't know if someone was in
there or something um but that was
number two
honestly like the first thing was fine
but when I heard like this growl it was
in my right ear and when I heard it I
was just like what the hell it was
literally like something was sat next to
me growling in my ear like I can't
explain it
that completely freaked me out and then
that was kind of the point when I like
really just got creeped out living by
myself and then the third one right so
the third one was with Milly my friend
Millie and I've known of like ever and
ever and ever
she basically came round and we went out
for my birthday so this was like this is
the end of July start of August so this
was pretty much like just as Oates what
the fuck is that
like can you hit that just as I'm saying
all of these stories and stuff I start
hearing stuff outside my door lock out
obviously it's crunchy just making noise
but oh my god I do you mind wait come on
tell you what I don't need any more of
these experiences right now especially
when I'm speaking about them what are
you doing
well yeah anyway so Millie came around
herself and we were having drinks on my
sofa so we were in the living room and
then we had like all my patio doors open
like all my sliding doors and basically
like obviously when it's windy and stuff
outside and if the sliding doors are
open the doors inside will slam so I
have how many doors do I have I don't
know I have like one lady in two and I
had one leading into the kitchen and
living room I had one for each bedroom
obviously and then I had one for the
bathroom one for the utility room and
one for the ensuite in the second
bedroom so I knew two of them were
already shot so the one for the utility
room sorry when she's just come
she's just being awkward now but one of
the the one for the utility room and the
one for their ensuite in the second
bedroom was shot and the one for the
bathroom was shot so that left the door
leading into the kitchen diner the door
leading into the main bedroom and then
the door leading into the second bedroom
that's the only does that were open at
the time um me and Millie was sat down
right and I heard the door I heard one
door slam and I was like okay that's
normal it's fine it will have been the
door for the second bedroom because
basically in my main bedroom to stop the
door slamming because it always used to
like make me junks it was so loud and I
put like a little door supper it's like
a little owl and I put it in front of
the door and so the first door slammed
and I knew it would have in the second
bedroom so I just I didn't think
anything of it was fine and then about I
say maybe like 40 minutes later why is
she being so weird
crunchy she's acting so weird and I
don't approve of it when I'm speaking of
this and but about 40 minutes later
later before even it's later I heard
another door slam so at first again I
didn't think I'm eating of it me and
Millie were just like trying it off and
carried on chatting and then as she was
like Susan I was sat there thinking how
was the second dog because it wasn't the
living-room monk so obviously we were
sat in the living room we would have
seen it so I was thinking how the hell
is the second door slamming when the
only one that could have slammed the
only other dog could have slammed has
already already slumped if that makes
sense because like I said there was a
door stopper on the main bedroom and all
the other ones were already shot so I
when I said to Millie I was like how the
hell is the second door son when like no
other doors are open so literally went
around the flat and saw no other door is
found not no other door I was like what
the hell how physically how could this
happen because the doors as well
they are like proper like once the shot
you have to like pull the handle down
open them like that provost studied a
horse you can't like the wind can't open
the door and once it's like especially
if it's armed its shot it's like shot
for God you have to fully open it so I
was literally sat there I was like that
is the weirdest thing
that's ever happened to me because that
one I just can't explain like the first
two oh this is the first one with the
light that could have been a fly or
something that flew over the light the
second one and with the noises and stuff
even though I feel like it was literally
so real it could have been explained by
something going on like in the flat
below I don't know it could have been
something but the door slamming Plus
Milly was there as she heard it I was
like how is this even possible literally
how was that possible so that was three
weeks before I moved out that was like
the last weird thing that happened but
that was enough I didn't need anymore I
didn't need anything more extreme than
that because that itself completely
freaked me out I was like I don't even
know what's happened if any of you can
explain it tell me in the comments but I
physically to this day I can't make it
out because my doors were like shot
properly and you cut the wind it's not
possible for the winds like open it and
then slam it again it's just not
possible so I don't know how it happened
I don't know I don't know what it was
there was no way it was in another flat
as well because the flat next to me
which was the only flat the only other
flat on my side of the building it was a
studio room it's like a showroom so no
one actually even lived in that it was
literally just me in that whole corner
of the building so there's no way it
could have been like another door and we
heard it that clearly like there's just
no way so I don't know I don't know boys
and girls it's a weird one but that is
like all the ways stuff that happened in
the flat and yeah nothing really where
this happened saying it's too much wood
I don't need any of that shit in my life
honestly but yeah I think that answers
everything and about living alone moving
home and all the way the stuff that
happened in my flat I don't know there
will be stuff to explain next there's
just no way like I do believe in that
kind of stuff but I just don't really
see it making sense in a flat that's
like a newly-built and stuff I don't
know it just doesn't make any sense to
me but make of it what you will and so
the next lot of stuff that people
mentioned on Twitter is like confidence
body confidence things like that and
which is always such a strange topic
sorry I'm just gonna like sort my hair I
was
not strange topic but I never know like
what to say for it in my head like when
I'm thinking on the spot obviously I do
but when I'm like hanging on the spot
I'm just like blah and but yeah I guess
I think a couple of people mentioned
like how to improve your confidence how
to improve your body confidence like
body positivity and staff and and it's
so hard because it's like how do you
even advise someone on that when it's
like I don't always feel and do percent
confident myself it's so hard to advise
on that um but I don't know if it's a
shot my bedroom door now sorry like
countries really freaked me out um but
yeah confidence in general is the hard
one I guess I don't know why do you even
start on this I feel like this is
something that I've covered in a little
bit in the last few videos and but it's
a hard line I guess I one of the
important things with like confidence is
to one not compare yourself to other
people and because the minute you start
doing that no matter what it is like it
doesn't even have to be body wise it
could be like comparing yourself to
someone who's got a better job than you
can parents and comparing yourself to
someone who's got I don't know like
maybe you think better friends than you
or I don't know it's got something that
you want that it's got something that
you want that you don't have and that is
just not that's just such a toxic thing
to do and and I think the second thing
is realizing that you can't please
everyone in life and that you kind of
just have to do things that make
yourself happy and I think confidence
can kind of stem from that as well um
but yeah I think a big thing especially
in like ah day and age with social media
and stuff so I've got a bottle of water
here because I knew that I'd get like I
knew that my throat would start like
burning up and but I think one of the
big things with that you know like
having social media and stuff like it's
so difficult and I think Instagram is
definitely the worst one in terms of
having an effect on your confidence and
your mental health and things like that
by far I think Instagram can be the most
toxic
I rarely posting this crap anymore and I
rarely go on it I don't know it's a bit
of a funny one
and but it's one of those things that
I'm pretty sure Victoria if anyone
follows in the fro I'll try them in the
article that I'm about to refer to you
and link it down in the description
below and what she did an article I'm
pretty sure it was Victoria and it was
all about the it was all about her her
what did she call it she called it it
was something about like on following
people and like why it's good to why I
felt better since I won followed set in
accounts and stuff like that and because
if you think about if anyone's like me
like on Instagram and stuff I I follow
Alexis ran Alexis is a good example she
absolutely stunning and Victoria Secret
models things like that obviously girls
that are so above and beyond like the
the you know just like so above and
beyond and so I don't even know what the
word is but just Alexis around
especially you know just so above and
beyond I'd hope you would know like what
was described as and not that I'm saying
there's anything wrong with Alexis run
obviously I've just said that I follow
myself and but it's like you following
certain accounts where girls is such a
touchy subject I like speak about and
but we're obviously her account is very
her profile and her like lifestyle is
very much based off like her buddy she's
got a beautiful you know buddy and
things and and just I don't know I guess
just like you know the way I guess like
a lot of her whole career and stuff is
based off how she looks and in this
article at Victoria it was all about you
know the benefit that it's been to her
of like so I'm just keeping around proud
of like I've liked and following certain
accounts where you will look at a
certain person think oh I wish that I
look like that and not that I'm saying I
such a touchy subject it's so hard to
like make sure that you make sure that
I'm expressing myself that I want to not
that I'm saying that there's anything
wrong with her account
or anything wrong with watching posts
and absolutely love a pro player
thousands of Iranian like along with a
lot of other bloggers and muddles and
things like that
um I've not trying to say really but I
think just not comparing yourself and
not um thinking I wish I look like that
or wish I was a certain way and not
being a certain way it can be like so
difficult sometimes because I think for
a lot of people you'll look at someone
who's got a really successful lifestyle
based off highly looking stuff and so
you can kind of thing like if I look
like that then I'll also be successful
if that makes sense like I think it's
just I don't try to say but I think it's
just like not comparing yourself not
wishing that you're a certain way just
because another person is a certain way
and just knowing that you can be just as
successful as someone or you can have
the things you want and you don't have
to be like them
I don't know if I'm making any sense I
feel like I've explained this so much
better in the past and but yeah honestly
just not comparing your kind of life and
the way you are and the person you are
to someone else because it's just not
the best thing to do and like it doesn't
benefit anyone in any way by doing that
and it's not like how do I explain it if
you're like I'm does not help in anyone
and people are going to watch this and
be like honey you're actually making a
complete fucking mess of this but yeah
all I'm trying to say is like don't
compare yourself to other people don't
you know you're a certain way for a
reason and if you want to change the way
you are and like within terms of
anything make sure that you're doing it
for yourself and not because you are you
feeling pressure to or because you feel
like you have to to like fit into you
know certain like standards and stuff
and yeah I don't know confidence just
all starts from like learning to love
yourself for who you are and you know if
there's things that you want to improve
on because we can always all improve
like all of us and just making sure that
you're improving things or like making
choices for yourself and not because you
feel like you have to or you feel like
it's you know what people would what
other people would want you to do
because that kind of follows into the
next thing where you can only ever
really make yourself happy like you're
never gonna please everyone and I'm just
no just like yeah I just like learning
to love the person you are and you know
it's one of those things that as long as
you're a good person I said this in my
first ever video I'm pretty sure as long
as you're a good person and you've got
good intentions like you'll be
absolutely fine in everything that you
do in life because like you know
that'sthat's the thing that people pick
up on anything that really shines
through someone is like their intentions
and who they are as a person and I hope
that made sense I feel like I just
rambled brought off Alexis Ryan and then
left not that I'm saying back the way
that I don't know how do I even say this
I don't know but um yeah I guess just
not comparing yourself to others and not
pressure pressuring yourself to think
that you have to be like someone else or
look like someone else because that I
think that's the thing with Instagram
like especially for girls and stuff
thinking I wish I look like her I wish I
was like there so I wish I had this
lifestyle like it can be so toxic and
like self-destructive and it's just you
know instagrams a place to share stuff
with people and have fun and things but
not look at someone else's life and wish
that I had that like just you know I'm
trying to say and just like embrace who
you are and you know set your own goals
and things and if you work hard and you
concentrate on yourself and you know
stay in your own lane and things and
things like good things will come your
way a good book I think I've mentioned
this again in past videos is the secret
by Rhonda Byrne it's actually on my
little shelf right here but like books
like that that are all about the law of
attraction and stuff can be really
helpful I think and for so like know
even just self confidence but for
finding what you want to do in life
because that's another thing people
asked about you know if you don't know
what you want to do in life and being
positive about stuff believing in
yourself knowing that you're capable
doing things not doubting yourself
itself doubt and things the secret and
books about the law of attraction that's
a whole different video and I might do a
video about that one day there's a lot
of videos online already on YouTube
about the law of attraction that are
really worth watching sorry the camera
cut out literally every 30 minutes the
camera will just like cut out because it
just can't cope and but yeah what was I
saying the law of attraction books about
that are really helpful for helping you
find like direction in life and helping
you to learn how you can achieve what
you want in life and setting goals and
knowing how to like bring your goals
into life because it's all about and it
kind of teaches you about the energy
that you put out into the world will you
know whatever energy you put out into
the world if it's positive and negative
that is what will come back that's what
the universe will give back to you and I
think it's really it really helped me I
remember when I first found it and I was
like I said this is a whole different
video but briefly this was I first found
this book when I was 16 years old and I
actually wrote I was working in a job at
the time where I worked for free no joke
I had a job in the summer right and I
for a whole month
I worked no wage like full-time no wage
it was crazy and but that's when I first
on that book and read it and stuff and I
just was so mesmerized by this stuff in
it and stuff like it just really grabbed
my attention and I was like that's a
really interesting way of living life
and you know how you think about things
and since then I've just I feel like
I've done well for myself and stuff and
I feel relatively good about myself and
stuff and I think it's just like really
helped so I'll leave a link to down
below but yeah books about the law of
attraction really helpful I don't know
if that really links in with
self-confidence but it kind of just
helps like set your own goals and stuff
and it helps you to concentrate on
yourself and concentrate on your own
life and a life that you're living
because you don't want to again going
about social media you don't want to
spend like all your time just on social
media looking at other people thinking
oh I wish I could be like that I wish I
could be there so that whatever and it's
important to like really concentrate on
yourself to you know build the life that
you want so that's a good one
and it sends a body confidence again I
feel like that's why sort of brought off
Instagram and stuff and you know it's
really funny because Milly again I don't
never ever mention this I feel like I
have maybe once I know I actually
mentioned it in a video that I never
undo to put load in but um Milly we were
sat in the car and I remember we were
how are we going I think we were on our
way to nun house and and me and Mellie
were sat in the car and we were talking
about like body confidence and stuff
Milly just came out with this just came
out speaking and she just said you know
like body confidence body confidence
like it doesn't actually matter about
you buddy like it matters about how you
see your body and how you perceive the
way you look because you know if someone
walks into a room no matter how slim
they are no matter how careful they are
no matter what if they walk into a room
and they just give off good vibes and
they walk in feeling really strong and
you know feeling they look good and you
know shoulders back working really
confidently and stuff you're gonna look
at that person think wow that person is
so you know beautiful and they're just
given off such good energy like they
just look like a good person whereas if
someone walks into a room again it no
matter what they look like and they kind
of look to their I'm not saying there's
anything bad with this but looks like
more reserved and looked uncomfortable
in themselves and stuff then you're
gonna that's what people kind of like
that's where the room for doubt is if
that makes sense and remember and she
said that and it was just like a
lightbulb moment cuz it was just like
it's so true like body competence it
doesn't even matter about your actual
body doesn't matter what you look like
it just matters how you think you look
like so that's one thing to bear in mind
because honestly like it's so true like
people will just bounce off you for who
you are if you know what I mean and I
don't know if you're like more confident
in yourself and it just believes so much
less room for people to doubt you offer
people to say things about you or for
you to you know think certain things of
yourself so I don't know I hope that
helps a little bit
and because you know really doesn't
matter like what shape what size what
anything you are and it just matters
like as long as you are happy with it
if you're not happy that's absolutely
fine like I said it's up to you to
change stuff in your life but you have
to do it for your own reasons
um but yeah yeah
I hope they're kind of helped I felt
like I just went on an absolute tangent
try to share and I'm not really sure if
it's gonna help anyone but um yeah I
guess just learning to love yourself for
who you are if you're not happy about it
and it's absolutely firing because you
know majority of us have something that
would not understand happy about it's up
to you if you want to change it if you
want to change it yourself absolutely go
for it but don't feel like you have to
just based on what other people say or
what you see on Instagram is what looks
pretty and things like that you know do
it for your own reasons um and yeah I
think that hopefully that makes a little
bit sense and I'm trying to speed up not
because I realized I've been speaking
for half an hour and I didn't want this
video to be as long as the last one so
um there's two more so because there's
one about like dealing with stress and
things but I don't really know what
people I don't know what you guys mean
about like dealing with stress as a
whole I'm pretty sure I covered that in
the last one a little bit um but the
first one the one before that is about
starting YouTube in like growing your
channel and then the one after is about
um my own little journey with like
health and loosing a bit of weight and
being vegan and because I am plant-based
now so in terms of YouTube and stuff I
got this question a lot I got a lot of
people asking me um you know Hannah I
had drug on my channel I feel like I put
lots of work in and my channel is not
going anywhere
I don't feel like I'm growing stuff like
that so it's such a hard one because you
know YouTube is such a big thing now I
think it gets constantly it just gets
harder and harder for new and smaller
channels to break through and because
there's so many of us like let's be
honest there's so many of us doing this
and for those girls who are like beauty
in fashion girls you know there's always
so much content that you can make and
there's only so there's only so many
people there only so many channels that
people are gonna watch and stuff and
commit to like it gets harder and harder
it really does
and I'd say like the people who are
smaller I'm just starting off and just
make sure first thing to make sure is
that you are producing what you feel
like is good content and constantly you
are happy with and you know make sure
that you like really think things
through think about the angle that you
want to give off think about what
content exactly that you want to produce
you know have like an area that you're
gonna focus on obviously like I said it
could be beautiful beauty and fashion
and all just makeup like beauty um but
you know really have like have
everything down so with tea and you had
as to what kind of channel you want to
be you know you market it in like your
banner you you profile pictures
thumbnails you titles so important guys
like you have no idea how important
things like thumbnails are people to
want to click on videos and thumbnails
are still something that I struggle with
like it's so hard to like choose what
thumbnail to you sometimes but make sure
it's well lit make sure and you've you
know if you have to edit a thumbnail
pretty much all of us do there's nothing
wrong with that just like you edit
photos for like Instagram and Twitter
and stuff make sure that it's well-lit
like make sure it's a nice bright like
fun
you know contrasted saturate it I don't
know just make sure it's the kind of
vibe that you want and it's really you
know it really takes the eye if you know
I mean and and again with titles and
stuff make them engaged in it stuff I
don't I don't even go down the road a
clickbait because I don't personally
believe quickly obviously it just help
and things like that and and if you want
it you know be a quick bit channel it's
fine nothing wrong at home but you know
if you're not gonna do that and you want
to have like genuine tiles and stuff
just make them engage in a fall and make
sure they catch people's attention I
guess and I don't know just social media
as well like it's really important what
I found really helped me when I started
out was making sure that I had making
sure that I was really active on other
social medias because with YouTube if
you're a small channel like I'm you're
starting out with 0 subscribers it is
gonna be so hard to like get fat for
user Potter video up with no subscribers
and for
people to start watching it like if that
can be quite a slow journey I would say
and if it's a fashion me then you're
super lucky to have like broken through
like starting from nothing and but if
you want to help yourself out like
honestly of being active on other
socials like being active on Instagram
and Twitter and things and snapchat as
well really good when you've started
building the audience and you want to
interact with more I need to stop talk
more I used to use it all the time and I
feel like I just don't it minute and but
yeah when I first started Instagram was
like the biggest help for me because
instagrams it's a lot easier to kind of
be found in history on because you can
use hashtags you can like tag runs in
you photos you can you know like other
people's photo so they see the
notifications you can comment on
people's photos you can you know it's
really a lot easier to engage within the
platform if that makes sense um and like
it just helped me so much like so I
remember I first started I like I don't
even think my channel I don't even know
if my channel would have taken off
without the help of my Instagram and
because I actually started an Instagram
first if anyone is an absolute AG you
all know this well I started on
Instagram face I use have an Instagram
called makeup by hand with a little like
X at the end like a lot kiss and I would
upload like makeup looks and stuff my
makeup was her lip her osius what would
was they're gonna say that was gonna say
hideous at the time like when I look
back on it it was awful
but and like there's nothing wrong with
that obviously because all of us learn
and grow and stuff and all of our skills
improve and that really helped me I
built a thousand followers on my
Instagram before I even started my
YouTube because I was like I don't want
to be making videos to no one I want to
make sure that you know there's someone
on Instagram maybe that wants to watch
and things so honestly like if you're
gonna do makeup and fashion makeup in
particular it's like Instagram is such a
helpful and platform for it because it's
really it really can help you to be
found so yeah really make the most of
socials like honestly because they will
help you out if you starting with
nothing on YouTube and then
if you want to start with nothing and so
that's absolutely fine but you will have
to work a little bit harder I think and
if and what I'm gonna say and it might
take a little bit longer and but yeah
one thing that I did as well I would
literally to meet people all the time
when I first started out just tweet
people on Twitter Twitter's a really
good place to chat to people I would say
and Instagram is a really good place to
like showcase that you work and it's
where I would use literature just to
reach out to people and say hey like and
I have just started a channel like I
know that you watch blah blah blah's
video so that you follow blah blah blah
um you know I make similar videos I'd
love if you check them out and you know
tell me what you think and surprisingly
like people really don't mind that
because a lot of people in our community
as well as so supportive of each other
and a lot of the times I would tweet
people and stuff and they be like oh my
god I absolutely loved there and like a
subscriber laughs I'm and that's how
genuinely how I got my first 10,000
subscribers because I would just like
tweet people will be like hey like you
know I started making videos this
similar to such-and-such and I know you
like their videos you know let me know
what you think of mine and that's
genuinely how I like got my first 10k
honestly just after noon that and then
after that it was kind of a case of just
you know focusing on YouTube and you
know just see where it talked and slowly
it just grown and grown and grown and
now I'm here um but yeah I would just
say honestly make the most of socials
chat to people engage with people and
you know I know
and obviously reply to as many comments
as you can and things like that when
she's still out there making noise
honestly my throat's like I'm flying up
and yeah and then a couple of people
mentioned about dealing with stress I'm
sure I spoke about this in past videos
and but what do you mean in terms of
stress I'll probably cover this in a
different video now because this one's
getting so long and I'll just move on to
the last one tell me what type of stress
you mean because um if it's like exams
and stuff I'm just preparing in advance
I would say don't cram like I did
because oh my god you'll have a meltdown
if his exams and stuff just make sure
that you super prepared and you give
yourself a lot of time so you
have to cram and he can do lots of work
overtime wrong then a little work
overtime rather than lots of work in one
go and yeah let me know what types of
stress because stress is something that
we all deal with as well like again is
it's just one of those it's just a part
of life I think when it's like
work-related and exam related and school
related and stuff and but yeah I let me
know I have to cover that in a different
video because this one's getting super
long now and but then the last one is a
coffee the last one a couple of people
mentioned about like health and wife
being eaten recently and and since I've
like lost weight and stuff and like
being vegan all that plant-based shall
we say and do that this car honestly and
but yeah so ah this is a long chat as
well actually I was gonna make a whole
different video on this because this is
such a long things to talk about and I
don't even know how to begin with this
so I don't give me this and I'll
probably just chat about the fact that
I'm vegan now in terms of like weight
loss and stuff again I'll probably save
that for a different video um but yeah I
um play at plant-based now so I
basically made the choice to go pump
bass or vegan I can't call myself vegan
because I'm not cruelty-free yet so I
know people will get fussy buying like
about that in the comments so I'm
plant-based
I don't eat any animal products and it's
been how long has it been it's been
nearly a month and I'm not at any
slip-ups or anything like that I'm
actually really enjoying it and I it was
one of those things I was like I'm not
gonna like either hey air or miss animal
products I miss me and stuff because I
have to say I used to eat a lot of meat
before not a largely by D a lot of
chicken and stuff and not so much red
meat but I'd have a lot of dairy used to
love milk and milk is probably the one
thing that I really miss like cow's milk
which officer I'm not going to drink it
because I know the whole process of like
making cow's milk and stuff it's just
disgusting and it creeps me out enough
to like stay away from it but I do miss
the taste of it
Pinal i am sorry it just bitch
but yeah just I don't know I literally
woke up one morning right so what
happened was I'm Charlie my brother
turned 18 I actually had an 18th
birthday party and at the end of August
and we made like we did a barbecue we
had tons of food we had like crisps and
like sour cream dips we had like you
know I pick Nikki food out and and I
hate so much I had a burger so I had
like red meat like beef I had a lot of
like a lot of cheese and stuff my house
didn't have I don't know I basically had
like a really fatty burger and you had
cheese on it and I had like cream like
charge a chive dip and stuff with that
crisps endings and had a lot of butter
and stuff Easter love butter as well
dairy is probably like the hardest thing
to like give up me but it's probably the
one thing that really pushed me over so
I ate all of that and then obviously
like I said it was Charlie's birthday
and we were having a party
mm-hmm sorry I'm getting so thirsty um
and it was getting to the like evening
time and I'd only managed to eat like
half of my burger because I was eating
it then all of a sudden I felt so ill so
I went upstairs and not to be really CMI
but I just like I had really bad shit
hits that's so gross to say but we all
have it we all know what it's like okay
so came upstairs obviously like I know
it can't have been that but over the
past couple like the past few days
before that all my family to come up
obviously for Charlie's party and stuff
and I'm pretty sure I'd had Pete's there
with like loads of cheese on like I've
just been eating shit basically and and
I thought just like that burger tipped
me over the edge and so went up says had
a really Polly thumb and then I just lay
on mums bad for ages literally I felt
like such a ball like I was just sat on
mum's bed in mom's room I completely in
the pitch black just lay that on my back
with my hands in my belly cuz I just
felt so ill
and and then my mom came upstairs and
mum was like Annie's here and Annie is
like one of our well basically Charlie
has a best friend who is Liam and
they've been like best friends since
primary school and unusually him sister
so me and Annie have always been really
good friends as well and and obviously
like they'd all come around for
Charlie's birthday and stuff so mom say
Annie Taylor stuff so I was like oh my
god I'm so sorry I've literally just
been up here dying in like I'm not even
downstairs socialize in so we came and
just like sat in my room me and honey
and Annie is vegan so she's completely
vegan like in terms of diet um you know
she doesn't use any cheese's or cruelty
free product stuff like that and I mean
it actually just been like I think it
was like a year on the day of Charlie's
party of her being vegan and long as I
it's like I'm he's one year anniversary
of being vegan or something I was like
oh my god because I've just been laid
down thinking like because I've been
debating it so long like switch no it's
like a pump is plant-based diet and now
they're thinking about it and then it
was like this angel had just come before
me in form of Annie you know just like
right help me like I need help so we sat
in my room and him she was just trying
to know I was like tell me like what do
you eat cuz I think the most
intimidating thing for people who
especially like me and you love me it's
kind of like I'm gonna miss me so much
and what am I even gonna eat like in the
process because you know it's such a
strict diet and in some ways um and you
know obviously there's a lot of things
that you have to be careful with like if
you've got four meals and stuff you know
unless you're cooking at home you don't
really know what kind of products and
things and stuff like that and and it
can all just seemed so like intimidate
in an overwhelming like when you're even
thinking about it so basically um I just
said - I was like come on tell me what
you eat like tell me what you make on a
daily basis like give me a run through a
few diet so you know she was just saying
that all the basics like fruit and veg
like fruit for breakfast porridge like
Oh toast with like avocado or other um
you can have things like cereal I can
make breakfast is the easiest one for me
because I can still eat pretty much
everything I always a I just
which a couple of things out so say if
I'm having like a bowl of cereal that's
like you can appropriate I'll just have
out milk instead of cow's milk and if I
have toast I'll just have jam instead of
butter I can have bowls of fruit I can
have porridge I can stuff like that like
breakfast is their easiest meal for me
because it's just like it's just
basically the same and and then for
lunch and like dinners and stuff she was
saying like stir Fry's jacket potatoes
what else we've seen hummus you guys
know hummus it's like my child like I
love her miss so much and she was saying
like yeah just like stir fries and badge
homer son like wraps and sandwiches and
stuff I'm I don't know things like that
is basically she just started like
seeing loads of stuff that I was like no
I eat so much of that anyway
like there would be it would not even be
even what am I trying to say it would
not even be difficult for me to eat that
all the time and like nothing else if
that makes sense
and obvious like pasta and stuff as well
like certain types of pasta or things
like that like there's so many things
that you can still eat you can have meat
substitutes and you know certain types
of like vegan sausages and beacon you
know they do everything vegan nuggets
I've got some friggin naan chicken
chicken nuggets in my freezer right now
huh and you can have like sausages and
burgers you know all sorts of stuff
that's obviously you can have like vegan
cheese and and you know the hunting is
so funny because we were starting about
and I was still thinking I don't know if
I can do this and then she whipped out a
packet of Oreos right and she was like I
wish someone hadn't told me this as well
but you can have Oreos Oreos a vegan and
I was like oh my god I was like - no I
can do this
as soon as I knew about the Oreos I was
like I can do this because chocolate
candies no thing is new a lot of
chocolate is milk chocolate I was like
dark chocolates fine most of it I think
and but milk I don't like dark chocolate
so is that I'm literally gonna be
without chocolate like ever like Kinder
Bueno is for my babies and I think when
she whipped out those Oreos I love Oreos
to death absolutely obsessed with them I
said you know what we can do this I can
honestly do this so you know we were
chatting stuff over and then Annie went
home and then the next year
it was Sunday and what had you on Sunday
I don't know I got up and stuff I ate as
normal
um honey what actually on Sunday I don't
think I ate a lot at all because I was
just feeling a bit ill and then Monday
start other week of the next week I got
up and I said you know what I'm just not
gonna eat any animal products today I'm
just gonna eat like plant-based today
and see how it goes so I had what did I
have for breakfast and I think I rice
crispies or something because rice
crispies I'm pretty sure well they are
vegan I looked it up
unless someone tells me otherwise but I
did look it up though vegan and I had
like soy milk with them or oat milk
Katmai what happened but I had like a
plumpest milk with them and and then for
lunch I had a risotto which was like
butternut squash and pie not really good
and then for tea I had a jacket potato
and I was like sure ah
I've really enjoyed eating what I've
eaten today so I got the next day and
then the next day and then the next day
and you know I'll just carry on eating
plant-based and stuff and it's now been
nearly four weeks and million months and
I absolutely love it so if you want like
a whole separate video about like why
eat in a day and stuff and things that
are like Easy's making things that i
think you're mean let me know and I can
do that separately but that's kind of
like the story I guess of how I switched
over to plant-based I feel it's just
woke up one morning I was like I'm gonna
do this um and yeah so far it's been
really good and you know it's great
because I also didn't realize before
because I didn't need I didn't need to
know about this but so many restaurants
offer good vegan food like zzs vegan
pizza is so good and it tastes just as
good as the original but I don't feel
like shit after be in it and pizza hot
as well had a peeps a hot last night
ourselves at Cannes just got like one of
the vegan bases with like tomato sauce
no cheese but like loads of toppings and
it was so good and you know you can
still eat shit to be honest like I think
everyone just assumes veganism is like
you know being healthy and stuff which
obviously you know the aim of it is to
be healthy as well as cut out animal
products and you know I try to be
healthy here and but you know don't
think they can't star like eat shit
because you know I can go on holiday
we'll just see in a bowl of cereal some
Oreos and then a friggin Pete's or in
the evening like chips as well obviously
and self chips crisps are a good one
like if you like to like have some
accent stuff and obviously you limit it
with chocolate crisps are really good
one
sort of minute crisps and my fave I love
them and popcorn really good again it's
like going to cinemas and it was like
the absolute same because you can still
have nachos but you can only have salsa
I think and you can have the popcorn you
can have coke enough coke but you kind
of Pepsi I'm pretty sure and Ben and
Jerry's have just brought for you can
ice cream so you can get vegan ice cream
and it tastes so good like we all had it
on Charlie's birthday and no one could
even really tell the difference and
there's like so much stuff it just hates
you know a bit of research but it's time
an energy and effort and stuff and for
me for someone who I felt like you know
now that I look back on it I do think
that I was maybe a little bit like
lactose intolerant or you know there was
just something about eat animal products
that my body didn't agree with um and
it's just so worth give it a go even if
you do it would say like six days a week
and then on day seven you have you know
a chicken breast and some veg still it's
one of those things where it's like
don't feel like just because you can't
do it all you shouldn't do something if
you not I mean like you can take baby
steps are there and things like that but
I don't know that's the whole different
video so I'm gonna leave it that because
how about when speaking oh shit now it's
almost have a wouldn't be as long but
it's been nearly an hour so yeah I hope
you all enjoyed this all there was a
couple questions about Cain as well and
about how me and Cain Matt and them you
know like I'm all detailed explanation
of like mine and Cain's relationship and
how we met and you know things like that
but I think we're gonna film a video
together so I've kind of saved all that
for when we film together and but yeah
that should be fun
I was gonna go around tomorrow but I've
got shooting London tomorrow so I think
I'm going to go around on Saturday
instead and film a video
ahem which should be nice but yeah
that's pretty much it so I really hope
you all enjoyed this video my throat is
burning burning guys I don't even know
let's call this anymore because I don't
really want to call them stripped-down
videos
I feel like that's just a bit of a weird
name for them I don't know what to call
it I might just put like a little emoji
and just upload it and but I hope you
all enjoyed it I'm gonna help you I
don't know
yeah I enjoyed listening to me ramble
you've got any questions about anything
let me know
and Sunday's video I've got an idea in
mind Vista news video I've never seen
anyone do it I'm actually really excited
that I think I finally come up with like
my own YouTube tag or like thing that
people can do on YouTube because I feel
like I should jump on the bandwagon like
no joke no shade to myself but I do and
some kind of excited about that but yeah
that is gonna be some nice video it's a
secret now and but I hope you enjoyed
this I'm gonna go anyway because I need
to get this uploaded in turn four seven
