it's been at such a long time since I've
sat down and filmed a chassis video in
my bedroom literally not since New York
like it's been a good few weeks now how
so hi I'm still alive obviously I did
the video in Rachel and the Christmas
party video which again I just want to
say thank you so much to all of you came
I hope you had a great time and I am
planning hopefully to do another one
soon it is super close to questions now
I'm finally feeling festive and in the
Christmas dreary it took me a good few
weeks at the start December but you know
I'm chillin I've got my pom-pom sparkly
tinsel earrings in it doesn't get much
more Christmassy than that so today's
video is going to be a New York howl
which is so overdue because like I said
I went a good few weeks ago now but you
guys have been asking for it and I
didn't pick up a lot of stuff okay a lot
of stuff so yeah we went shopping in
Sephora and I got some stuff in Urban
Outfitters Topshop because when I went
over Kylie cosmetics had the pop-up
store in Topshop which was just
absolutely lethal I spend so much
friggin running in there I'm gonna start
with Sephora because I feel like as soon
as I stepped through the doors of
Sephora and picked up a basket so many
things type making their way in so we've
got quite a lot of stuff first thing
that we've got which I actually haven't
got at the packet yet genuine all this
stuff has just been sat in my bedroom
waiting to be used because I never like
to use stuff before I haul it this is by
Pat McGrath because at Pat McGrath is a
brand that we just don't really get in
the UK it's pretty much only on Sephora
in terms of like where we can get it
from and so this is like a liquid
lipstick it did actually have a tester
of this out in the store and I gave this
a swatch which is kind of like a lip
gloss I think yeah it's called the Bruns
actual vinyl glass this is stunning I'm
gonna swatch it in a second so it comes
with a liquid lip on a glass and like I
said the gloss is what made me buy the
whole set I'm not actually swatch this
yeah so we're gonna give it a go now but
Pat McGrath I've heard so many good
things about her cosmetics um obviously
there are a little bit more on the
pricey side I can't remember how much
this was but they're a little bit more
expensive what the quality is supposed
to be amazing
so whoo kind of like a rosy like more
the nude that felt really soft like
swatch as well and then the glass boys
and girls let me just show you this lip
gloss so I don't know if you can see in
the package in but it has like
all these reflexes like gold Sparkle I
don't know if you're gonna be able to
tell it's got so much like it's hard to
tell on camera on camera it kind of just
looks like a basic glass but it's got so
much like gold reflect to it its got
like tiny tiny little bits of gold
glittering I picked up another lip
product because this is out at the time
when this is the fancy Beauty uncensored
I'm sure net lip pain I've seen this all
over the Fen t bc Instagram and stuff
like that looks absolutely stunning it's
kind of just like a bright red like
quite like a True Blood rat applicator
it's very interesting it's kind of like
I don't know if you can see but it's
just like a little squiggle thing great
explanation there Hannah nice lime so
ignore that one cuz for some reason I
thought it'd be clever to do it through
the glass that you set up that obviously
it dries matte but it's just like a
really true read it's kind of like a lot
of colors that I already have but I just
wanted to try the actual formula of the
sternal lip paint so I'm really excited
to give that girl and then what else did
we get I got some stuff from Burberry
which again it was so expensive but when
I saw the testers and I kind of play
around with it and stuff I was just
obsessed i thing is just a liquid
lipstick again it's kind of just like a
basic nude color but I wanted to try out
the formula again and I feel like nude
is always a good way to test a formula
because I always love a good nude you
know hi yes so this is one of the liquid
velvet lips in the shade zero one light
nude first of all the packaging again is
stunning it's kind of like a frosted
glass it's quite moosie it's a lot more
moosie than the rihanna one because I
feel like with liquid lips it's just up
there and you either got quite like a
thick whipped like moosie texture or
more of a liquid texture remember how
much every single item was by the way I
know some people sometimes get noted
that I'm really sorry and I will link
every single item down below so if you
just click on the links and stuff it'll
take you to the website where you can
see the prices and things like that next
thing I picked up was a fresh glow
highlighter you know I had to pick up a
highlighter whilst I was there so again
this is bite very okay so first of all
how pretty is like the actual pan like
the way it's embossed I don't know if
you can see but the actual like puttan
on the pan it makes me not want to touch
it to be honest I'm not gonna lie it's
definitely more of like a softer not
well no drop set it's definitely more of
like a softer glow as you can see that
and it's not got any glitter or anything
like that it's kind of just it to me it
seemed like the sort of highlighter that
will just kind of melt into the skin
kind of like the one I wear for makeup
forever which is what I've gotten today
I picked up a Galang um law durians I
never will say this law radiance
concentrate primer you guys know I love
this I just needed a new one because for
some reason like I just cannot get my
hands on one at home at the minute it's
just the kind of like radiating primer
with like the little gold bits and stuff
quite expensive but considering it's so
expensive and I bought a second one that
kind of shows how much I love it like
it's a primer that works really well on
my skin which is kind of like dry to
normal and then Superunknown body picks
up a product by way so this is a dry
shampoo dry shampoo yeah pretty much
just because I needed it on a holiday I
forgot to pack a dry shampoo and it's
something that I cannot live without
like I just love a dry shampoo it's so
handy for days when you've not wash you
hair and just want a little bit more
texture and volume doesn't leave any
white streaks which is an issue I have
before because I use my batiste Warren
just because it was like on my table and
even though I love batiste it does leave
I'm pretty sure it's still that I tried
to cover it with like root spray but it
leaves like white shirts and streaks in
your hair which is kind of annoying
this one doesn't know it's really nice
and it smells really good as well so I'm
excited to carry on using that I've
picked up a product from Natasha - Nonna
I really wanted the sunset palette but
it wasn't in stock in the Sephora I went
in I'm kind of a good thing though
because I was in there with Craig he's
like my God brother um and honestly the
amount of money that was funding I
really didn't need the palette okay what
about it a lot of money on smart council
so blessing in disguise this is one of
the crystal top coats in the shade nude
i swatched these and they just looked so
pretty I'm just gonna get a little bit
to swatch it's quite like a mu C a
formula um but they just swatch so
lovely like I'm really excited to use
this on my eyes obviously as a lid color
and stuff like that it's just down there
they've got tiny specks of glitter in as
well and they just feel really really
soft
Natasha's you know nur again is a brand
that I
so many good things about some really
excited to try it and that I picked up a
good few products from hourglass we do
have hourglass in the UK but I don't
know if it's like more expensive in the
UK but for some reason I just never want
to buy it from here I don't know why I
got a new hourglass and vanish finish
coverage whatever it's called foundation
stick because I do have this in the
shade sand and even though I love the
formula I did like a full video on it
and straw the color just isn't quite
right for my skin like it's way too
yellow for the 10 that I wear so I
haven't actually used it since which is
kind of annoying this one's in the shade
golden and I swatch it next to Craig
helped me pick a color up lesson i
swatched it next to my George Armani
power fabric foundation in the shade six
because that is literally like a perfect
match when I've just done tan like I've
never found a foundation that matches so
well and I don't have to mix it so we're
pretty sure that this one is the closest
color to 6 in Giorgio Armani and it's in
the shade of gold and I'm not gonna
bother like swatch knit and stuff like
this I'll use it in a video and stuff
the formula is really nice it's just a
bow legs and it's like so expensive
considering like the amount of products
you get I went through all of that in
the video and things and if you want it
a little bit more of an affordable dupe
Make Up For Ever Ultra HD stick is just
as good I'm not as full coverage in my
opinion and a little bit more dewy but
very similar for a much better price
point I just wanted to give this one a
proper go in a different color next day
I go it was an hourglass ambient
lighting
bronzer I've heard really good things
about these again I'm pretty sure
Jacqueline Hale used to use this quite a
lot and I always trust her
recommendations so this one is in the
shade Radian runs lights and it just
looks like so there was two shades of
shades if this I'm pretty sure there's
like a dark one as well which I was
tempted to gap but I'd probably only be
able to use it when I'm like fresh least
hand and not like all the time if you
know what I mean so I'm excited it's you
give this one a go as you can see it's
kind of like a blend of different colors
and things scan I got those based off
Jaclyn hills at recommendations I can't
remember when she mentioned this I'm
pretty sure she's in a tutorial oh stop
oh this is one of the ultra slim
high-intensity refillable lipsticks in
the shade I wish just like
tiny tiny lipstick it's kind of like a
cross between a lipstick and eyeliner
because I could line my lips with this
but because it's like chunkier you can
use it like as a full lip color as well
which I'm guessing is what it's designed
for it's like kind of a mini lipstick
you just feel really really soft really
easy to swatch they don't really took on
the skin or anything like that it's just
kind of like a pale nude pretty sure
this is the lightest one that they do
and I love a good like nude so I'm
really excited to give that girl and
then the last thing that I got is the
immune metal strobe lighting palette
which I'm guessing is like the newest
kind of ambient lighting powder that
they do because they do a few and
they've done them for quite a long time
now like the blushes and the branches
and the powders and whatnot and like
even though I like them I never like
them enough to buy them because they
just seem kind of like I don't want to
say basic but just not something that I
would reach for a lobbyist ones however
i swatched them in the store and they
just seem to have a lot more like kick
to them like they're a little bit more
kind of glowy they had a little bit more
pigmentation and stuff like that you can
buy these individually as well I believe
but I just thought the little palette
was quite cute
and I'll swatch the middle one and the
end one and as you can see like they're
on my two that finger and nothing about
it just got a little bit more of a punch
to them like they just pack a little bit
more color and stuff like that and they
just seem to work better as highlighters
and like bronzer toppers so I'm really
excited to give those a go they're still
quite natural powders but I feel like
they'd be really lovely so bailed and
kind of give like a natural glow all
over the skin so that is that but else
did I pick up okay I picked up a Josie
Maran
not quite sure I say that this is a
vibrancy argan oil foundation fluid this
one is in the shade adventurous
I think Josie Maran is like known for
Argan oils and stuff like that so I'm
really excited to give this a go so this
is what it looks like in the package and
it has quite cute like colorful
packaging and then the actual applicator
it is supposed to be that bent actually
no that's very curvy but it is kind of
like a chest I've just got that
everywhere it's kind of like a apply it
to your face with a wand applicator it's
not a pond
or anything like that I'm gonna close
that before I make an absolute mess but
again since it's a foundation I'll save
it for our first impressions or
something like that I picked up one of
the sort of Sephora like Christmas sex I
believe this is so this is the face mask
magic it contains six face masks like
the Sephora ones because you guys know I
love these in particular the pale one
which is the middle one here it's one of
my favorites it just leaves your skin so
like hydrated and soft
I can't remem which this was but it's
worth $36 obviously it's cheaper and
stuff so I thought I would pick this up
rather than getting individual masks
because I haven't really tried that
other ones in here so I'm excited to
give that a go I love a good sheet mass
and then absolutely you know color pop
is now sold on Safari which is super
cool because I always forget to like
order it online but then when you go
into store and you see things like it
just you're like yeah I want that you
know what I mean so this is the polite
1/2 set and it comes with six super
shock shadows this is what it looks like
in size so we've got deep dive drift
birthday girl birthday cake stereo &amp;amp;
Seek where they all look so so stunning
I'm gonna swatch just one for now and
then save the rest for a video they're
all kind of like metallic kind of
glittery lit colors and stuff like that
so this one is the shade stereo it's
kind of like a brown like a warm brown
with gold reflex you can see that it's
like a really pretty copper color and
will swatch him yeah so yeah it's kind
of like a sort of brown like a multi
brown color with like gold reflex to it
which looks super pretty so I'm excited
to get those a girl and I've tried a few
color pop items but I've not tried many
and I'm not tried any of the super shock
shadows so I'm excited to see what the
light okay so I'm pretty sure this is
the last thing I picked up eight heart
Mauro Zucca
oil I love a good face oil at the minute
and the one that I use the most is the
l'oreal extraordinary face oil so i
thought i would pick this up because
again I've heard really good things
about err they do it in two different
sizes so I got the smaller one just
because it's not something that I use
tongs but something that I like to have
so I thought the smaller the better the
packaging is so cute it's so bloody cute
I'm just obsessed so I'm really excited
to try this it's always so not something
I can swatch or anything like that it's
just like a face oil and like
body oil I'm guessing um yeah that is
the last thing I picked up that was
everything from Sephora I'm gonna move
on to Evan Outfitters because there
wasn't too much stuff that I got from
that was just like little bits of
clothes and things like things that lack
there so this is a little bag that it
came in it I'm not being in an urban
outfitters in the UK in so long because
we have one in Manchester like city
centre but I don't tend to go there as
much anymore and I prefer shopping and
travel centers stuff like that so I was
really excited to pop in because it was
like Black Friday as well they actually
had buy one and get half price off
anything else which was really cool most
of it is underwear because they had
Calvin Klein's and at Calvin Klein's for
women are so expensive at home and
because it was like buy one get one half
price I was like Noah I'm gonna stock up
on underwear so that everything yeah so
it's actually all carbon claims to offer
there's not tons of air the first thing
are just some Calvin Klein joggers I've
never even seen these before like they
just have the sort of CK like waistband
all the way around kind of like the
briefs and stuff do they have these in
black in it great I believe but you guys
know all that everything all the time
just look like a really nice pair of
joggers and I live in joggers especially
at this time of year I like when they
have cuffed bottoms as well like these
because it keeps my uncle's nice and
toasty and they've got good pockets
stuff like that I got a size small I'm
pretty sure yeah I just got a great
thumb because Calvin Klein briefs are my
favorite like these in Victoria's Secret
pretty much all I wear now I find these
the comfiest and I don't know what it is
like the Cotton's just really soft like
they're really comfortable to wear I
just love them absolutely love them so I
got a another great on and then I saw
this little sat which again I'm not
seeing this in the UK I don't know if
it's just a thing that's an urban
outfitters or what but I am obsessed
it is velvet so again it's just like a
carbon clean brief and bralette set but
it's all black velvet they had these in
so many cool colors like new sand
Maroons and stuff like that and so I got
the actual little bralets hop which it
just comes in like a small medium large
again so I just got a small and then I
got the briefs as well and again I got
these in a small and they're just black
felt like come on how cute is this like
velvet so Chris
as well so I'm really excited to wear
those and then I got some little Nick's
and briefs and stuff from at Victoria's
Secret as well because as I said
Victoria Secret and Calvin Klein and my
favorite underwear to wear
comfort wise so I have got a couple of
these already from home but I picked up
some more because again with it being
Black Friday like we had so many good
deals on and so these are just like what
I don't know what style they're call
like I don't actually know what that
Cole I think I just called cotton briefs
but if anyone knows like what style of
vs NYX these are like they are the
softest things ever so they have them in
a bunch different colors at the minute
and they are just so friggin soft they
do do them at home as well because I've
bought all the colors and stuff from
home but I love the white ones so I
picked up a few pairs of those I also
got like a maroon color very Christmasy
you do have them in thongs as well I
don't know if they have those in the
accessibility mi I feel like it's not
but it is at the same time I'm like they
have thongs yeah they have some versions
as well which I've not seen at home so I
thought I would pick these up these are
friggin tiny like are these gonna go
over my bum I don't know and then the
very last thing I have to share with you
which I'm kind of ashamed that I bought
so much stuff from the hair this is it's
in a Macy's bag but I have got my pot
shop bag inside this is my shop from
Kylie cosmetics which came to a good
solid like five hundred dollars I would
say I spent so much money in there um
but again it was kind of one of those
experiences where I was like I'm just
gonna grab a bunch of stuff and I
probably won't keep it all some of it
will probably go and giveaways and
things like that but to make use of
having no ship in and no costumes I was
like bitch like I'm getting a chunk of
stuff okay give me the sharp pain with
some stickers as well which I will never
use but I appreciate thank you we got a
velvet liquid lip collection because
they had a couple of different like
collections and stuff like that but this
was the only one that I liked the look
of and I pretty sure like these are not
sold individually so I'm not gonna get
every single one of these out and swatch
them because that would just take me
forever and I don't always like opening
liquid lipsticks when I'm not using them
I don't know if that makes any sense and
but these are I'm pretty sure these are
like a limited set so we've got show off
Shopaholic trendy and a fashion
late I'm not sure which one is which and
but I will be using these and videos and
stuff like that so that is a set and
they obviously come together like those
specific colors yeah and I'm really
sorry I can't remember how much this was
in fact I do have a receipt here so let
me try and help you out Oh for fuck's
sake this is so annoying because
literally all it says on the receipt is
cosmetics doesn't have any names or
anything like that so I'll leave a link
to it down below but literally the
receipt all it says for every single
item is cosmetics hello
someone breaking in I don't know and
then I picked up the sending me more
news because the holiday collection I
fell in love with when she brought this
out but I didn't order anything because
I just couldn't bring myself to pay for
the customs and the chip-ins as I've
said and so this is the matte liquid
lips at so that is this set that again
obviously I'm not gonna get them all out
right now but I will save them from
videos and stuff I don't know if these
will limited-edition and as I said I got
a bunch of lip kits pretty much every
single lip kit that I don't already own
I'm not gonna keep all of these I think
I'll save some of them for videos
because they're not all my kind of
colors but I just kind of grabbed them
and left so we've got harmony which is
kind of like a pinky color which is not
something I'll probably wear so that
will probably be saved for a giveaway
we've got Fuji which I do really like
the colour of it's like a deep red so I
probably will keep that the only thing
about Kylie red sometimes though like a
darker shades in the liquid lip colors
can be a little bit patchy so hopefully
this one it shouldn't be
we've got charm which is kind of like
more of a brownie nude compared to
harmony so I'm gonna get that one out
and see how I feel because I do have
like Kandy K and stuff like that which
are probably quite similar I got a
poison berry which looks like a really
cute color it's kind of like a berry
color as you would expect and then I got
a bunch of glosses so we've got popping
glass because I was so upset when I
didn't get my hands on this it sold out
really quickly back when it was released
I can't know what collection this was
for but she has brought it back quite a
few times sorry but really itchy nose
but you know that it's so cute because
that is my favorite gloss from Kyle
I got one from the Coco collection which
is the shade cloth is it's actually a
liquid lip sorry I'm pretty sure it's
like I'm pretty sure class is like a
pinky color let me just double check is
it like kind of like you can see there
it's kind of like a new dish color like
a pinky nude you can't really see the
packaging doesn't show you what you can
see why the drips are and stuff like
that and then I got another single
liquid matte in the shade dirty peach
because again this is one that I have
loved and like seen on people and
absolutely loved so I'm really excited
to try that one and then I got a bunch
of highlighters and blushes because
again is something that I never bothered
getting online I actually do want to
give these a swatch now because
obviously they're kind of like a hit or
miss things some people say they're a
little bit and some people say they
are actually quite blind in and so this
is probably like the one that will suit
my skin tone the most in my opinion I
never like down here on my home but you
can't really see it has like a fair bit
of pigmentation but at the same time it
kind of just blends into my skin color
right now then I also got the shade
cotton candy cream which again is like a
Goldy shade but a little bit lighter so
that is the color that in the pan let's
just give him a little swatch so that is
the shade better again how's like a I
don't know I think it's because like
they just don't have a lot of like high
shine like they're definitely that but
mmm I don't know we'll have to try it on
the cheeks okay and then I got one blush
because blush is something that I don't
tend to wear a lot so this one is in the
shade x-rated and I always prefer more
like orangey Coral blushes too pink
blushes so this is the one I picked
owl that is the shade right there they
actually have a lot of pigments to them
so I'm excited to give that a girl I got
two of the loose powder highlighters I'm
pretty sure I already have let me
actually chat I'm pretty sure I already
have one of these oh no actually don't
okay so I'm just gonna get one out for
now I got the shade Tahiti and the shade
Fiji so I'm gonna get Fiji out just so
you can see what they look like so this
is the pot that this one
and I'm just gonna open it oh that is so
so pretty okay why should we do it
should we do it like duh Wow
come on that is Jonah and then the very
last thing I got considering you know I
probably already had enough by then I
picked up one of the Coco collection by
Kylie cosmetics pallets which I probably
will give away because it's not
something that I would tend to use as
much but the one that I probably will
keep is the Kylie cosmetics skinny get a
face GL I'm not gonna get that one out
because it will be safe for a giveaway
but I'm gonna get this one out because
it is mine and I can squash it as much
as I want the packaging for like all of
this collection is just stunning like
I'm obsessed and so it comes with a
bronzer and a highlighter as you can see
here so let's just do a quick one of the
bronzer and then one of wow they look so
so pretty so that is those two that
really excited to get those ago I feel
like this is definitely something I
would use more than the Chloe one the
Chloe one it comes with a bronzer blush
and highlighter which is obviously
really cool if you use all three but as
I said I tend to stick with just a
bronzer and highlighter and not so much
blush these days so that will be saved
for something else but yeah that is
pretty much everything I got was I was
in New York I really hope you all
enjoyed this video I feel like it's been
at like definitely a long one so hats
off to you if you still watching to this
point because I feel like I've just been
chatting for so long but hopefully
