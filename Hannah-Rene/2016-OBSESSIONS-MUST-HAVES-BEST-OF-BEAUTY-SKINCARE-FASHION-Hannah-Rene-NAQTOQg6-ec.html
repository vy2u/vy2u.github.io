is my first video 2017 which I am so
excited about I feel like it's been so
long since I actually just sat down and
filmed a video because the last one I
did was like was it the Boxing Day one I
think it was my Christmas and Boxing Day
haul because the one after that like my
tutorial was pre filmed now I didn't
upload on the Sunday which was New
Year's Day because I was going so Happy
New Year we all had a wonderful
Christmas and New Year's which I've said
about five times honestly I just I can
just tell us it's gonna be another year
of me chatting to be honest yeah I
am so excited for 2017 I have to say I'm
so excited for some of the stuff that is
coming up that I'll be able to tell you
about soon I'm just excited to smash it
you know we're all gonna smash it's
gonna be good so I thought I would kick
it off with a 2017 favorites because I
did one of these last year for mm I know
it's 2016 favorites and I did a 2015
last year
whoops because you all seem to really
enjoy it last year and I did ask on
Twitter and a lot of you said you would
like to see it again so it's going to be
a mix of makeup and a couple of skincare
items and then also some fashion and
like fragrance stuff as well I basically
just included like all my favorite
things from different categories I guess
I did want to just include like my fave
faves they don't want to put anything in
for the sake of it and but that there
are still a lot of products and a lot of
things to get through so I have a
feeling this is going to be a long video
because I honestly Rumble so much and
you guys know it so pause this video
here go get snack or drink
let me know in the comments what snack
or drink you've got and yeah let's go I
also just want to say I won't be
including stuff that I've spoke about a
lot already so for example like Nivea
men post shave balm which I've read
about all year Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
sick stuff that you guys know I love
already I'm not gonna like talked about
as much because I feel like I just
talked about them all the time and you
guys know that already like my lifetime
favorites anyway so I'm just going to
keep it stuff that I mean we don't speak
about as much but you will have still
probably seen with that being said yeah
my favorite primer was Nivea men photo
shoot bomb I absolutely love that and my
favorite and predation was makeup
revolution she's sick
both what I've got on right now I wear
them all the time I cannot find anything
I love so much I really can't the
combination of the two I love I have
normal to dry skin and then just work
perfectly so those are my favorite
primer and foundation in terms of
I thought I would mention the Maybelline
fit me because honestly I really
struggled with concealer this year I
feel like especially at the start of the
year I was using it was maybe like pro
longwear and Urban Decay Naked and I
liked it but I was always waiting for
one concealer that I liked on its own
because I always mix them like I never
liked one on its own I had to mix two
together I started using the fit me on
its own and oh my frigging god I love
this eye I basically tried this a long
time ago and I stopped using it because
I didn't feel like they did a shade this
piece of hair is really annoying me I
don't feel like they did a shade that
was light enough my skin tone because I
didn't used to wear a lot of fate an
asshole like I'd put a light layer on
but it wouldn't be as dark as how I have
it now as I did begin to wear more more
fake tan though I feel like the shades
work perfectly for me now that is the
only thing I don't know if they've come
up with a lighter one since I used the
shades hand and the Jade 15 and I
basically mix them together but I
wouldn't be able to wear these if I
didn't have a ton on because I feel like
that even darker that the foundation I
would wear so I definitely want to be
able to put them onto my eyes but when
I've got tan on these are a dream like
honestly they blend out so beautifully
and for a drugstore concealer
considering I tried high-end ones that I
don't like half as much I cannot rate
this enough like honestly it's about 5
pounds or so and it's so worth the money
if you've not tried it I would 100 so
recommend it and it's perfect for under
eyes especially for normal to dry skin I
would say because I found it really
hydrating which I really like but yeah I
love that I use it pretty much every day
now along with the Make Up For Ever
stick and the Nivea man push a ball and
that is like my go-to skin base product
for bronzer I have the makeup forever
Pro bronzed fusion which looks like so
this is in the shade two five one I want
to say they've all got really with like
shake names I have fallen in love with
this well last year I don't actually
know when I got it and but I like it
because it's not in my opinion
completely map it's got like a really
nice very very subtle sort of Sheen I
like luminous to it but it doesn't look
that way on the skin I just feel like it
goes onto the skin and it looks like a
natural bronzed effect
I feel like it's just so easy to tell
between a bronzer that looks obviously
bronzer and a bronzer that looks like
your skin if you know I mean I don't
know if I make
in any sense but I just love this it
blends like an absolute dream it never
goes like chunky or like chalky on me
because I feel like there's a couple of
bronzes in my collection and they're
just really sort of clinging to patches
and then they just look really like
textured and rough and I hate that I
just absolutely love it it's so stunning
and then in terms of blush I feel like
this was just the air of no blush for me
I really don't wear a lot of blush
anymore which is crazy considering I
have a draw literally a massive draw
right now which is just filled of
blushes and but I really just like
didn't wear a lot like I've not got one
on right now I felt like I just got into
the routine of just using bronzer and
highlighter and that's how I liked it
like I just like my skin like that so
that is what 2016 was no blush as for
highlighter again I feel like there's a
lot that I love this year and but the
only one I'm going to mention which I
think I've mentioned in other another
like favourites video as well is the
Anastacio and Sun dipped glow kit which
just looks like so I just love this like
I just blow it I feel like it's got a
really good range of shades and I like
that they're all quite different I feel
like she does that quite well and with
all of the glow kit palettes I tend to
just mix these two hairs so we've got
summer and moonstone one is slightly
more and like yellow base and the other
one is slightly more rosy pinky base and
I just love it I absolutely love the way
it applies I use a fan brush with it and
going on today on the tops of my
cheekbones it just blends like a dream
it sits really nicely the only criticism
I would say is that if I if I just put a
bit on or like I just put a normal
amount on like this I feel like it does
wear off throughout the day I don't know
if that's just me but I remember coming
home one evening I looked in the mirror
and my highlighter was just not that
because I'd had my makeup on all day and
so that's the only thing that I've got
to say about it maybe it kind of wears
off kind of quickly but other than that
I absolutely love this and the super
pigmented let me just swatch the two
that I use the most those are those two
right the tide and oh yeah I'm obsessed
with them I absolutely love it I feel
like in general Anasazi products are far
in terms of eyeshadow again there are a
couple of different palettes in
eyeshadows I want
the first one I'll talk about really
quickly because I have a gun mention
this in a previous video this is the
modern renaissance palette by anastasiya
and I have lived breathed dodge
resurrected all in once because of this
palette I freaking love this like it's
so good I use it every single day pretty
much even if I'm just going to use like
two shades like these two down here
which has been orange and raw Sienna
they're just such a beautiful transition
colors I've got it on today like that is
what is my eyes if you want to know I'm
like squinting now yeah I've got pretty
much the red tone on because this red
gives me life like it's so stunning so
for people who ask me is this palette
worth it yes it is on 2% you can get it
uncle beauty I think it's about 40
pounds or so I'll link it down below
with everything else but yeah I I can't
imagine not having this palette now next
one again it won't come as a surprise to
anyone that this is my morphe 35o two of
the shades have actually fallen out here
that's the only thing that sort of
bothers me about the morphe palettes
like they're not very like well made but
obviously for the price i think they're
about 17 pounds or so you really can't
complain the 3/5 oh if you like 2016
which is the year of the 3/5 Oh like
every one one edge or had this palette
it's so so beautiful and just like a
bunch of really warm eyes shadows I have
to say I don't use it a lot anymore for
my eyes because I have that Anastasio on
which I prefer the formula of those I
feel like these can be quite dry which
is like the issuer's having before where
they don't blend as well but these
shades down here these are the only
things I have used on my brows pretty
much all year like unless I've switched
off for a video or try something
different or anything like that these
three shades particularly like this row
here I have this darkest one here at the
MINIX obviously I've dyed my hair and
but they make such Cillian brow shadows
I absolutely love them again it's on
Corp you see and I think maybe like
beautybay does it as well so I will link
it down below it's always sold out but
if you go on copy so you can join the
wait list and then you get emailed them
and it goes the minute it goes back in
stock so you got it straight away my
makeup geek palette oh my god
I made this quite recently and because
they very kindly sent over a bunch of
different eyeshadows so thank you to
makeup geek and but I've just been up
for there since the minute I made it I
mean look it how can you not love it
it's just me in a palette I love it so
much it's just a mix of warm shades and
then purples because my favorite colors
to ever use on my eyes I will either use
something with reds or I'll use some
something with Purple's like batter they
like you just complement to my eye color
because the red really makes the blue
pop in my eye and the Purple's will
really bring out the green so either way
like it just looks really pretty I'm
still dominating our weather to do a
full video on this so do let me know but
if you want to know like top faves oh my
god he need curtain call which is this
one up here this is like a really
beautiful red foiled shadow I mean look
it up just you just know you need it
when you see that cabin fever I
absolutely adore so stunning it's like a
really warm ready
terracotta brown it's so pretty from
Brule I feel like I use that all the
time that is this one down here I mean
the pigmentation of them all is just
insane for the price I feel like you
just need it it's so worth building and
make a peak color and beauty majors
stock make a few shadows now and like
the blushes and the contour shades etc
so I would definitely recommend it and
again I'll link it down below let me
know if you want a video on it because I
might do want even of enough people one
ear and but I'll also leave in the
description by my favorite ones that I
feel like almost halves as well and then
the last I shadow is that I want to
mention are just the general Too Faced
palettes because every like 2016 was
really the year of me trying out to
phase like earlier in the year I went
out and basically bought a bunch of
stuff myself and then later on they very
kindly concept to me and put me on the
POS and now I'm looking off which is
still crazy but I'm looking enough to
receive a lot of their products in like
new releases
I love the branding of Too Faced Posadas
because I feel like the brand is just so
like well thought out and well done like
it's when you see a palette and it's a
Too Faced palette you know it's a
two-faced palette if that makes sense
the fact that they're all scented as
well like all the pallets are just so me
cherry cordial in the chocolate bar is
my favorite it's a beautiful like after
the deep burgundy and again in the
bonbon palette I absolutely love satin
sheets which is like the highlight shade
and then again the more sort of plummy
Brown which is called Bordeaux and just
they're just so pretty
absolutely love them I 100% recommend
stuff from suit base I'm not just saying
that because they send me stuff
obviously I've invested my own money
into a lot of their products as well and
but in particular their eyeshadows and
their lip products which I will get onto
later and that those are my favorites
like those are the one things well the
two things that would definitely spend
money on is that palettes and there let
me I quickly just want to mention some
other brows of and liquid liner stuff so
the first thing is the brow artist
plumper by L'Oreal I only just recently
started using this I used to use the Mac
Pro Longwear like waterproof browser and
but I love this so much I've got it on
today I think a little bit a lot because
it really matches my brows really well
and the Mac one is a little bit too warm
for me whereas this one is a lot more
cool toned and I just feel like it sets
my brows so well obviously it's a
drugstore Prout as well and so it's
pretty affordable I'm not entirely sure
how much it is but I'll link it down
below I just love it like it keeps my
brows in place all day it stops the
little hair roots from you know escaping
and doing the wrong thing and I just
can't write enough so if you're after a
good brow gel I really would recommend
that then it tails of liquid liner
I feel like 2016 was the year of the
Rimmel exaggerate liner for me I rave
about this stuff all the time I don't
use it as much anymore because there are
a couple that I've started trying out
more and but there was definitely like a
good six months in 2016 where I just use
this non-stop particularly for my
eyelash line and to go over gel because
it's so black and that's the one thing
that stood out for me the minute I used
it because I've obviously always loved
doing winged liner but the minute I use
this I was like I've been doing it wrong
because this is honestly just so black
like the minute I put it on top of my
gel liner I was like woah so again for
the price point it can't recommend it
enough the only thing that annoys me
about this and I really really want
someone at Rimmel to watch this video
and bring out a new product or if they
have one then someone let me know and
but the fact that the brush is so far I
really don't like that because I like
right let me let me look I mean it
doesn't look that about that but it is a
chunky liner brush compared to one that
I you
by next which again I really like and I
just think it's too thick to do actual
wings with oh my god I just freaked me
out because I looked in my mirror and
the door opened but it was the cat I
just really want them to bring this
exact liner this exact formula out in a
skinnier brush as well because my life
would be made hello and then in terms of
actual falsies I wouldn't be me if I
didn't mention the House of lashes
iconic switch I have to say I'm not a
massive fan of these anymore just
because as I've said in previous videos
they are too obviously fake for me now
like I like them for some locks but for
99 percent at the time either lashes
that look more natural because I do
prefer like a more natural lash look now
if we want to call it that these are
very thick and they're very like
obviously oh it's not focusing there we
go now very like obviously false in my
opinion because of the way they're
shaped and i love i love them i really
do i absolutely love house of lashes eye
products oh my god my cameras just
completely switched i just feel like
they look too obviously false me now
like i used to love them and at the
start of the year i wore these all the
time these were the only lashes i wore
and i do like them for certain looks but
just not for everyday and the only other
thing that sometimes bothers me is the
last round is so thick that it can get
really pokey in my inner corner and that
is the one thing that really bugs me
about false lashes because i find it so
hard to wear them without my eyes
getting irritated like this is why i've
switched to ones with thinner lash buns
now because they just oh especially on
the inner corner my eyes water really
badly and throughout the day they got
like all this inner part i don't think
anyone else has this problem but this
inner part of my eye like my inner
corner there will be no makeup there by
the end of the day because my foundation
and my concealer and any eyeshadow has
just been like watered off though we all
know i switch to these bad boys which
these are the lily luscious j makeup
they're what I've got on right now I
wear these 24/7 and you know it's such a
love-hate relationship because I love
that these have a thinner lash band but
I really do find that they wear more
easily because of that like especially
when you pick in the glue of and no
other people have this issue with
Lily lashes as well but when you pick
the glue off the lashes just fall out
like they just come out it's so easy to
just pick the lashes out like I have one
pattern oh it's not this power but I
have one pair that's got hardly any
lashes and then they don't even look
like little lashes any one because
they're so bad but they are beautiful
like I've got them on right now I'm just
going to get all up in your grill but
they just they just look fluttering
wispy I feel like they look natural if
we want to use that word I mean maybe
not natural but I feel like they look
like it could be lash extensions or
mascara and lash extensions that they
don't look too obviously false which is
why I really like they are pricey this
is the only thing they're so pricey and
I know the other about thirty pounds
I get mine from false lashes Kinetico
cup cost eyelashes Koike which I'll link
down below and but they do last me a
good month so it's basically I see it as
thirty pound for about thirty wears if
I'm lucky if I don't pick if I if I'm
doing all of them and I don't pick them
off too much I can get thirty wears out
of these easily so it's basically a
pound aware it's a pound every time do
makeup that is how I feel about them and
I mean you could invest in a pair and
just save them for special occasions and
then they could last you up to six
months you know what I mean so it's kind
of like a give or take and I feel like
for the policy you do definitely pay for
the quality of them obviously they come
in like nice packages as well they have
their own box and providing that you
look after them they should be okay but
do be aware when you are picking blue
off you need to be so frigging gentle
because I'll fall apart and I just want
to include like a more affordable option
because I know those two are quite
expensive and people do often ask me
like Hannah please give us a good lash
that's like relatively affordable
basically have an area where they're
very dense and sure and then they've got
a couple that are more wispy like if you
go on the website you'll be able to see
what they look like and they're full all
the way around which is not like me to
like a lash dice fall all the way around
but they do get slightly shorter at the
inner corner to be fab I just feel like
again they look very fluttery natural
wispy they go with a sort of look that I
used to wear them with and I do still
wear them but I just feel like I don't
reach them as much but if I do have to
opt for an affordable lash
then this is the one in terms of
lipliner there's only a couple that I
want to mention so the first one is
stripped down by Mac I have got this on
right now I wear all the time
I feel like 2016 was the heir of nude
nude lips to me because I love like a
super nude lip so yeah this one is
stripped down it's more like a brownie
nude which again I feel like 2016 was
the year brownies to me I really went
off pinky news like I just don't really
like them that much anymore because I
feel like brownies flatten my skin too
more and so I'll do a quick little
swatch so you can see what it's like and
I do prefer the normal Mac lip liners
it's just that I do prefer the normal
ones the pro longwear ones just because
prolongwear ones there's such a bitch to
sharpen like they're so difficult to
sharpen and you never get them fully
sharp again where it's just a normal
pencil like this it's just so easy just
do do don't have you want a good
drugstore lipliner at the Rimmel
exaggerate on what they called the
Rimmel lasting finish sorry these are
good in general Rimmel lip liners clean
pretty sure they do have some Accord
like exaggerate I might have made up and
pretty shall I do and but Rimmel lip
liners in general I think they're about
three pounds from boots or superdrug and
they are so good they do remind me a lot
of the Mac ones and in terms of like the
formula I find them pretty much the same
I would say and but it just tends to be
that the Macklin's do colors that I
prefer more but my favorite two are
spice which is like almost a jew or like
the actual max spice and then also
Indian pink so again the pigmentation of
these is beautiful and again I don't
find them too drying at all and to be
fair the spice one is quite pink it's
like a lot more pink than the Mac one so
spice is on the end there it's like a
pinky
brownie nude and then Indian pink is
more of like yeah a sort of reddish pink
I would say in terms of actual lipsticks
the first one I want to mention is myth
because guys if you've been watching me
since like the start of the year or
longer you all know I went through a
phase where I use this all the time like
especially when I worked at Marc and
obviously this one is so out of date you
can just smell it it's just most part
especially when I worked at Mac though
meth was all I used to work my lips
like I just loved it so much I guess I
hate this when I first got it was one of
the first month's MUC lipsticks I ever
got when I was about 16 or so and I used
to wear it on its own which is my I
tried it on its own laughs like no I
hate it because it's so pale like guys
and guys it is lighter than my hand
right now like it is a very very pale
flesh toned pink nude I would say like
it's more on the pinky side than the
brown side I would say and but it's pale
that's why I hate it first and then I
started wearing it with stripped down
and oak lip liner by Mac and I loved it
because I would lie my whole lips or
strip down and then put this in the
center I really just made my lips pop
and they looked really pouty feels good
on the lips I don't feel like it's too
drain it's a satin finish so it's not
completely matte and 100% the first part
of 2016 I did not put this down I loved
it so much that you can see I nearly got
through like the whole tube I used to
take this up nights out as well and be
in the bathroom like it yeah and then in
terms of liquid lipsticks the first one
I want to mention is Cairo by NYX Rache
got me onto this she basically said you
need any life and I bought it I bought
this unfortunate cookie based on her
recommendation and I love it both as you
can see it's just a pinkish brownish
nude I would say only thing about the
next ones obviously they're very
affordable which is fab and but in terms
of like comparison of what other liquid
lipsticks they definitely do like like a
tiny little bit of pigmentation I would
say and that is Cairo Cairo right there
you can see that it's just like a really
nice kind of similar to myth actually
like it's a little bit darker but yeah
it's just like a pinky brownish nude and
I do have to do two layers of these
that's the only thing but I have no
issues with like a comfortability that
is not the right way I've no issues of
how comfortable they are lips I don't
find them drying I don't find them yeah
uncoachable I don't feel like they get
bitsy on my lips or anything like that
they do definitely new topping up
throughout the day I would say and what
for the price point I love it and then
for the very end of the year which is
actually actually what I've got on right
now as well as I was saying before to
face I love mostly for their eyeshadow
palettes and their lip products and this
one is the first one this is one of the
melted maps in the shade cool girl
so I'll star lies yeah this one is in
the shade child star and I just frigging
love this I love the formula of these so
much they are my favorite liquid
lipstick formula I'm going to put it out
there I'm gonna say everyone is right
that and again it's kind of a pinky nude
I don't know I just had I prefer
brownies but I do tone them down with
strip down at lip clinics obviously
that's quite brown but I just forget it
oh I love this if I want something if
I'm going on a night out and I need my
lipsticks with us all night or from
going on a date baby kissing the boys
man I can't believe I just said that on
camera but honestly if I'm going on a
date or if I'm going on a night out and
I just need my lipstick to frigging at
last I put this on and it's good to go I
absolutely love it
I just thought of something actually
else that I want to mention lip primer
by Mac I have used this non-stop this
year when I was at mark and one of the
senior artists was he using new artists
I'm pretty sure know it was like our
regional senior artists I'm pretty sure
it's called John and he got me onto this
this is the lip prep and prime which
looks black so I've pretty much used it
all now it's very much on its lusts and
like I just I cannot wear a liquid
lipstick without putting this underneath
every single time I wear liquid lip say
I don't usually include it on camera
which I don't know why I'm just quite
pleased like that I'll just work it on
and not really think about it and but it
hydrates and it primes and that's what I
like because again like I said my lips
are quite dry I don't like putting
vaseline or a lip balm on underneath
because it's not it hydrates but it
isn't made to keep your lipstick on if
that makes sense so it makes it feel
comfortable but it doesn't help it to
last throughout the night whereas this
does both and that's what it's designed
to do so yeah that I recommend and then
this on drips I recommend it again like
I said in general the formula of these
they've got so many different shades but
that's one in every loved them so much
this one in particular I have it on
right now with everything else that I've
got to mention it's my fave okay I'll
see what lip gloss but nearly dawn I'm
sorry this has been so long already so
cute bye pop cup Carly hi Kylie I
absolutely loved this for a good portion
of the year I still do a little bit now
but I have a couple of issues with it
and what's going to and the arch or
shade of it I adore I like it because
it's pale like obviously
she came out with like literally and so
cute that is so cute on there it just
works so well to like top off things
like child star because obviously their
balance and balance out a little bit I
would say and this is type of really
itched is definitely on the paler side
and if you like for nights when I want a
really nude lip like I want a nude nude
this is perfect to put on top because
the kylie glasses have a good amount of
pigmentation as well they're not a gloss
or you just put it on an it lips they
just make sure lips look glossy like
it's an actual sort of pigment in itself
like I could wear this on its own if you
don't mean the only thing I don't like
about these is they're so thick because
they like a thick pigmented gloss I feel
like they're so thick that if you layer
them with something like if I lay these
two together I get the sort of in a room
situation and product really just builds
up on my lips and I can just feel it
like I forgot this is my tongue I can
just feel it all around my lips and just
don't like that so I do love this but I
don't wear it as much stronger glass
that I have been wearing 24/7 this is
one of the Too Faced
lip injections if you don't like glosses
that tingle you will hate this because
there are times I've put this on and I'm
like wow that's really hurt this
one is in the shade milkshake and I love
it because it's just like a really nice
sort of neutral nude and it's got little
and it's got like a gold reflect to it I
would say and it just looks beautiful
especially over there Too Faced and
liquid lipstick I absolutely love it and
at these bad boys as well these are the
G way lip toppers I only got these
recently or maybe it was like in fact no
I went to an event with Rachel in London
and she had skinny get which is this one
and she let me use it and I was just I
was drawn I just I knew I needed it this
one is skinny dip and as you can see
like oh my gosh they're just so pretty
like they just go on the lips like
liquid glitter shimmer gold you know and
just see the reflection of it oh my gosh
I love it so much I use it 24/7 I've got
it on today and then frostbite it's
really interesting because it's like
white but it's got like a metallic lilac
reflect to it I would say like this the
specks of glitter in both of them and
but frostbite it's like purpley you can
see
get that it's like really pale like I
put this on before for the first time
and I was like Jesus Christ that's Hagel
and but yeah it's just got a really
beautiful like light look reflected I
would say so I love both and the whole
thing yeah I say they sort of drawl down
a bit quite quickly and but the actual
concepts of them the smell of them is
well they smell insane I always use it
this one first the two bass lines are
the nice and juicy and plump and then I
go over top with those I'm so
high-maintenance in terms of lips like I
use about five products s what it might
feel like I spoke for so long and we've
all made your makeup the bed right
I'm gonna keep skincare sweet short and
sweet so in terms of moisturizer at the
start of the year if you watch my
channel you will know that I love the
number seven beautiful skin normal day
cream and I still do love that I just
not picked up another one I went through
two tubs and I on trips I'd recommend it
to anyone who's got normal skin or like
normal to dry they do do stuff like
every skin type though if you go to
number seven that all color labeled as
well is really cool this is the one that
I use since this is the vitamin C glow
boosting moisturizer by the body shop
and again as you can see the top the saw
is gone it's empty I need to get a new
one how about this one in particular is
it goes on the skin but it absorbs
really quickly like the number seven one
and if you like something that's very
creamy and rich and you can really feel
like that your skin is moisturized and
like you know Andy sort of touchin is
tacky that is what the number seven one
gives rise I feel like this one you
apply on to the skin and then it really
absorbs quite fast so if you want
something that you can't feel but still
moisturizes then I will go with this one
I personally look both and I'm not
really fussy because obviously I got on
top with a primer anyway so it doesn't
make too much difference and but yeah
again for like it says Ford oil tired of
clumpy skin which is basically making
unto actual cleansers obviously it well
I don't have a lot people know this but
I am guilty of just using makeup wipes
and personally I don't think there's
anything wrong with these makeup wipes I
love them I use the ones by simple I
like the Mitel ones so I would recommend
those but if I do this is basically a
product that I use if I want to get in
the shower and I can't be asked using a
makeup wipe and I just want to wash my
makeup makeup off in the shower so this
is by derma and this
competent jelly cleanser which renews
and brightens when it comes in a little
purple jar like this and you open it up
and oh my gosh every time I open this it
smells very strongly of something but I
can't put my finger on what it is if
anyone's got this please let me know
this is what it looks like and so yeah I
pretty much uses throughout the year in
the shower because the way it works I
wish I could show you but I'm not going
to be able to see it the way it works
it's obviously quite a thick gel I just
scoop a little bit off and apply it all
over my my face would like make one and
just sort of like work it in and then
the minute you apply water or like your
skin gets wet it turns into a milk and
it just sort of runs off the skin is
that make sense so it's very thick and
gloopy as you can see like it's so weird
when you apply it because it just feels
like you put in like beeswax all of your
face or something or just something
that's really like not supposed to be
there I feel so wrong but then the
minute you get in the shower and then
you just sort of wash your face off it
all just runs clean and it's very it's
so good at removing makeup I I like this
as well because I can use it on my eyes
I can like rub my lashes well my
mascaras been and it doesn't irritate my
eyes or like get in my eyes or like you
know
sting my eyes or anything like that and
it it does get them a scar off really
well that's another thing with makeup
wipes like they just don't
in my opinion remove my scar as well as
like products like this okay the next
one is by a brand called nooks I want to
say it's mu X E this is that gentle
exfoliating gel with rose petals this is
a mini one I really need to get anyone L
because I've actually run out of this
like I run out of it as a last night and
I have only recently started using this
so it's not something ever you start the
whole of 2016 but I love this the minute
I used it is basically a gel with like
exfoliating beads in it so it's just so
good like I use it in the bath and it's
just so good I knew the cleanser fit and
then apply this and as you're working it
into your skin you can really feel the
little like beads sort of exfoliating
your paws and like cleansing your skin
properly I like it though because my
skin is so sensitive so the minute I use
anything that's like exfoliant base
that's quite rough and textured
my skin usually just doesn't like it and
it goes quite red and quite pigmented
and it gets quite irritated whereas with
this I feel like it's harsh enough
to do the job of like exfoliating but
not so harsh that it sort of strips my
skin and irritates it like it's just so
nice to you so if your SEM learn you've
got sensitive skin or you just looking
for a good facial exfoliator I would 100
I recommend this I need to order a
full-size one which I will do in a
minute a mask that I wanted to mention
this is by Glen Globe this is that youth
mod tingle exfoliates um take that yeah
it's basically the youth mod it comes in
a little black pot like this I feel like
Glen whoa it's very much a hug brand and
this is the only thing that smells so
minty like this is the only thing I've
tried for them and I do really love it I
only use it in certain areas because it
is very strong in my opinion I usually
use it here where I get large pores and
when my makeup sort of clogs up the most
and then I use it a little bit on the
t-zone and around my nose and it does
the job so well I'll leave it on for
about five or ten minutes and and it
definitely tingles quite a lot I
remember the first time I put it on I
was like oh my god my skin just doesn't
like this because I thought it was my
skin reacting to it but it does it every
time and I've never had an issue with it
mask I wanted to mention and it is one
of these but it's not this particular
one so this is one of the Sephora face
masks I wanted to mention the pearl one
which is like a lighter pink color but I
don't know where it is I have one left
I've got my uncle to pick me some more
because he's currently in like Chicago
I'm pretty sure it was in Chicago of
Christmas and I asked him to pick me
some more because they're so affordable
but so friggin it good so this one is
the Lotus face mask and this is
moisturizing and soothing I do really
like this one what the pillow one I'm
pretty sure it's like brightening it's
brightening and something and it's so
good I basically use these after the
glam glow on because I feel like a glam
glow one doesn't irritate my skin but it
really sort of like what's the word like
it just I need something after it's a
sort of soothing cool it down and these
do that perfectly yeah I always use this
after that one and it's basically just a
sheet mask that you just open up and
then you put it on your face and it
feels so go onto the pillow one in
particular like I don't know what it is
but I can always tell again the day
after that I've used it I've used that
mask on my skin just looks so luminous
and fresh and healthy and glowing I
absolutely love them if you ever do not
order on Sephora I would definitely
recommend trained some of these because
I love them so I did just want to
quickly mention that because I've been
obsessed ok fragrance guys this is my
favorite product of the year and I only
had it I had it less than a month and
this is my favorite thing I have ever
owned that's an exaggeration but it's
true this is by Jo Malone this is my
fragrance of life I've decided this is
the only thing I went out this is one of
their Freight like perfumes aftershaves
fragrances what did they even call these
clones because John well I was like
multisets like it's not and when I went
to their world duty-free event she was
basically educating me on like the
history of Jo Malone this job because I
have to say I do not own anything John
will accept this because me it's
 expensive but this makes me
excited this makes me excited child I
swear to God this is their black cedar
wood and juniper Cologne oh it is so
 God so good I can't actually
explain how good it is every time I wear
this someone will be like what's up what
you wearing spray me help me bitch love
this as well breach came to Manchester
not so long ago and she took a picture
of it while I actually sent go on and
and then I'm pretty sure she asked for
it for Christmas as well because she
loved it and it was definitely because
we were going on like we went out into
town for drinks and she got into the
test food for me and then I ran outside
and that just sprayed this and I've got
in the taxi and the taxi driver was like
oh you smell good and rich was like oh
what's up and I was like wow again I met
up with an old friend the other day and
he absolutely loved it as well he was
like shitty smell good and that's like I
know I'm just never gonna happen
understand I know right now I'm not like
I will be doing a favorites video in
five minutes time and I'll still be
wearing this and telling right now
anyone in Manchester get your asses up
just go to jungle own smell this fall in
love
buy it I just I can't everyone needs to
sell like this all the time I just love
it so much so that is my fragrance of
2016 and the rest of my life amen
okay last thing is clothes because I
want to mention two pieces of clothing I
was kind of being in but then I was like
you know what
2016 was the year of bandage for me like
I found my love the bunny's trousers
bandage skirts Spanish dresses bandage
crop like you name it it was bandaged so
the first thing I want to mention are
the Georgina Charles's buy my bandage
dress because Jesus Christ I have gone
by I wear these all the time I have
three pairs of just the black ones
f3 but these are two of them
have three parts of just the black ones
and then I also have the nude ones the
gray ones and the pink ones the blush
ones basically it looks like this and
the thing that I just love about them
they make you figure look so good I
don't know like I don't know if it's
just me obviously sound to opinion but
for me they just suck you in and curve
you out in all the right places and
they're so far these are 100% my babies
like I I would be lost without them if
they stopped selling these I'd have an
issue
I'm fall out with them and then the only
other thing I want to quickly mention is
banish'd dresses from misguided I do
obviously love them from my bandage
dress as well and but I feel like the
misguided ones obviously they usually
have sheer dis going on they can be a
little bit more affordable a little bit
easier skating hands-on except sure and
this one in particular started the
bandage of this is actually what started
the bandage obsession so I felt like it
would have been wrong not to include it
in this video so this is the misguided
dress and a lot of you probably seen
from people I like all the times it's
basically a lilac color it's a v-neck
and then it's got these bandage straps
down and it just curves so well like if
I actually you can see the shape of it
here like it curves out so nicely and it
just hugs you figure so well like the
minute you zip this up you just feel
like 10 you really do I'm not gonna lie
I'm just so in love and so much things
including chocolate finger but yeah
that has been my 2016 favorites I know
this video has probably been at like 40
minutes long I don't really not stupid
that I'm probably gonna want to click it
down and but honestly 2016 was the best
year of my life and I all saw like I
know pretty much all of that to you guys
so I just want to take a minute and just
say thank you so much I know I said this

wonderful life and all these fab things
