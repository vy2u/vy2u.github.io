similar it's kind of like a similar
video to what we did on Thursday because
obviously I've got my eyes on it but
I've got no base makeup on at all when I
was in super Joker the other day I
actually picked up some of the L'Oreal
infallible stick cream products stick
you know what I mean so as far as my
work these are fairly new I don't think
they're like super new anymore but
they're quite a recent product that
they've brought out so they basically
have a bunch of different shades in this
that you can use for like foundation
concealer cream bronzer highlighter
stuff like that so I picked up four
different shades because you guys know I
love love I love a good stick foundation
and Make Up For Ever Ultra HD stick is
one of my favorite foundations of all
time so I wanted to test these out and
see if they any good reason 9 pounds I
believe and I think in super joke at the
minute they are buy one get one free
L'Oreal do tend to have a lot of offers
on kind of like that like buy one get
one free or buy two things for a certain
amount of money or whatever I'm just
gonna read out a little bit of the
description just so we know what to
expect when we apply it in things like
that so it's referred to as a shaping
stick foundation and it provides a long
way customizable base that lasts up to
24 hours that's a long bloody time it
says our first base shaping stick has an
ultra creamy no compromise formula which
seamlessly it melts into the skin for
buildable coverage without the mask of
that table so it says you can use as a
foundation a concealer or to highlight
and contour which is why I picked up
three different shades in the normal
formula and then one shade in the
highlight formula which is kind of a bit
more shimmery it's like designed for
actual highlight and the cheekbones and
stuff so in the foundation formula I
picked up 200 honey which I'm hoping is
gonna be my foundation color and I
picked up 160 sand which is quite a bit
lighter so hopefully gonna use this to
concealer and then we've also got toffee
which is 220 oh he's like king also
airings of the day what do you think let
me know in the comments these I just
think of so cute and they actually do
them in a bunch of different colors the
pom-poms the only thing is it doesn't
really mention anything about the finish
it does say it creates Oh in fact I've
just completely bypassed that ignore
even coverage while the matte formula
crease of flawless shine free base so
it's matte which I have normal
spin some foundations for a bit
hit-and-miss some of them I do really
like anyway I'm just gonna get into it
so I feel like I've been speaking it for
so long now
so the primer that I'm gonna use is the
Smashbox photo finish primer water
I feel like this just gives a really
dewy skin base that made no sense it
really hydrates my skin so I feel like
it's good especially when I use matte
foundations like my Giorgio Armani power
fabric and things like that so these are
the three shows we've got to work with
we've got toffee which is going to be
hopefully a cream bronzer honey which is
the foundation color and then sand I
think this was which I'm not sure that's
gonna be light enough yet but we'll see
how it goes okay so we're gonna try
applying this the way that I would
usually apply a stick foundation so when
I use my makeup for ever'one
I basically take the brush on at the
product and then apply to the face
rather than draw it on so I'm literally
just gonna coat the bristles with a bit
of foundation and then I'm just gonna
start applying it to the skin okay so
it's a tiny bit dark compared to my neck
but it's not too bad
that blend it out quite easily so far
I'm it's definitely more of a medium
coverage at the minute because you can
still see a lot of like my beauty marks
and stuff but poking through I'm just
gonna grab my concealer brush and go
around my brows whereas I've just put
the brightness down a tiny bit on my
camera so you can hopefully see the
color a bit better but that is what it's
looking like so far so this side
obviously has no foundation and then
this side and does have the foundation
this is the only thing with wearing
hoops when you do makeup it's just like
fly around and go in the way I'm not
gonna put too much product under my eyes
because obviously we're gonna go in with
the lighter shade that ah and to be
honest it doesn't look matte at all I
don't know if you can see I don't know
if it needs like a minute to dry down
and I'm definitely not complaining that
it doesn't look mark because I'd rather
it had a little bit of like low eNOS to
it the only thing I would say at the
minute is that I feel like you you won't
be able to see on the camera but I feel
like my cheeks here where I've got like
the biggest pores they definitely look
larger than they usually would with
foundation on kind of seems to look a
little bit textured nothing grows
like it's not a massive issue but it's
just something that I wouldn't usually
notice like my paws here okay so that is
one later I'm not gonna put any more
iron I did build it off a little bit
here and it kind of needed a little bit
more blending when I put a sort of
second layer on but all in all it looks
pretty damn good I'm gonna go in with
the lighter shade next and we're gonna
try a little bit for concealer I don't
usually love sticks for concealer
because I feel like they're a bit dry
and kind of took under the eyes a bit
but it did say on the website that it
can be used for concealer so I just want
to test that out and see how it goes and
then I'm gonna go in with a bit of the
darker stick as well and use that to a
cream contour so I'm just going to do
like under my cheekbones at temples
jawline all that good stuff so we've got
this shade is not that much lighter
might have to go in with a bit of normal
concealer anyway I do feel really creamy
when you apply them like you don't took
on the skin or anything like that like
they feel really soft I don't know what
to blend out with I feel like I'm gonna
stop running the concealer even though
it it just looks like the same color as
the foundation kind of which is wigs
it's quite a few shades lighter but I'm
just gonna start blending it in a little
bit I'll probably go in with a lighter
concealer on top like a liquid one but I
just want to see how well they work
together okay that blended out pretty
well it's definitely given a bit of
coverage under the eyes as well as you
can see this eye compared to that side
looks a little bit more put together I'm
gonna do the runs a bit for the contour
bit I feel like they're not really
contour because it's a bit too warm but
I'm gonna do these with a brush the
reason I do these sections with the
brush is because when I come to do like
underneath the cheekbone I kind of like
to just pop I don't like to swipe it too
much because I don't really want to move
the line otherwise it kind of looks a
bit muddy so
that's blended up pretty damn well
excuse this by the way I will fix that
in a minute what the hell that's
actually going to notes oh well I don't
know why I'm so surprised I'm gonna go
over with the sponge around the jaw just
to soften it because you don't want to
the only thing with puttin like cream
bronzer and Bruns it around the toilet
and is you don't want it to look like a
stripe around you George you know I mean
I love that shade as well this shade
toffee it's actually not too warm but
you can see like with using the brush
obviously it's still not fully blended
out but it does keep this sort of shape
really well so it still cuts the
cheekbone quite well one of the things I
really like as well is that they don't
dry down fast that you saw that we left
that bit of bronzer or cream contour or
whatever when alcohol were here we left
that up there for quite while so that
was sitting on the skin for like a good
5 minutes or so and it's not dried down
it's still blended out just as easily as
all the other parts I like that you can
share them out as well because I
probably applied a bit too much product
out on my nose but if you go in with
like a damp sponge just kind of like
softens it all should have probably just
taken these hoops out and then put them
back in at the end but oh well we know
we don't know so yeah I literally a dump
swipe asshole you just want to do really
like small pushing motions I guess like
just pushing it into the skin okay it's
not looking too bad not looking to you
shopping but thing is like you could go
in with a tiny bit more of the
foundation shade and I'm just gonna like
put a tiny bit on the bottom of my
sponge and then if anything's a bit too
dark you can just mash them together a
bit okay so that is how it's looking
doesn't actually look matte at all
really you can see that my skin still
has a good bit of glow it's not crease
that much either
like first stick in general I would
never usually use stick products under
my eyes but it doesn't feel joying it
didn't talk on the skin it's not made my
under eyes look dry if anything they
look like hydrate edge because the whole
skin kind of looks hydrated only other
one we've got to try is the highlight
stick so I got this in the shade 5:02
Gold is cold this is gonna be like the
real test because stick highlight is I'm
just not fun at all
I just it's a no I just taught by them I
don't know why
though those are the three shades we've
got there and then I'll swatch this one
here also it's not got like tons of sort
of shine to it as you can see it down
there it's not got like tons of shine to
it it's just like a little bit luminous
hmm I should probably use a clean sponge
for this but I don't have one so okay so
it blends out okay it just doesn't do
that much in my opinion like it's added
a bit of a glow to my cheekbones but
overall like my skin as a whole is just
glowy like it doesn't have a lot of
shine to it at all I don't know if you
can see I've just put some one like the
bridge of my nose it's just not really
got a lot of shine to it which in a
sense is good like if you want a natural
highlighter and maybe you just want it
for every day or you just want to play
it to bare skin and you can use like
something like this which kind of just
melts in and looks a bit more natural
than a powder you know it's not really
done much this one's a bit of a mess for
me I think okay I'm gonna set my face
with a little bit of powder can you use
some Rimmel stay matte because I've
fallen back in love with this now after
my last video so I'm just gonna set the
under eyes so I'm not gonna put any more
concealer on I feel like I don't need it
and then we'll see how they react with a
bit of powder but she really impressed
because I honestly didn't expect to like
it under my eyes at all it's not really
crease that much either which is strange
because for things like creams and like
like pots of concealer if that makes
sense not liquid concealers they would
usually crease under my eyes I'm not
going to use tons of powder because I do
quite like the fact that it looks glowy
I don't know if it was like my
moisturizer I used my Sunday Riley
CEO moisturizer under this which is
quite a glowy moisturizer and then I
also use the Smashbox primer water as
well which all-in-all does make you seen
glowy so I don't know if it's to do with
the base underneath the makeup that's
made it look so sort of hydrated because
obviously on the website was it did say
it had like a matte finish I think
like a shine-free finish which this
definitely is not shine-free
like it might be shine free if you use
different primers and stir flat bronzer
I'm just gonna use a tiny bit so we
definitely don't need a lot now that
we've done cream runs and stuff I'm just
gonna use a little bit of the Make Up
For Ever Pro bronze fusion just to kind
of I don't really know add a bit more
bronze enos I'm just gonna add a tiny
bit like that much I did actually pick
up another L'Oreal product for
highlighter because I thought we'd just
go full L'Oreal shebang this is the
crushed foiled metallic highlighter in
oh it's in rose quartz
okay let's hope it's not too pink I
don't know if these are new but they
were unlike a stunned in like the
L'Oreal section that was kind of
featured products if that makes sense so
it kind of looks like a new product but
it might just be featured at the minute
I don't know just gonna do a quick know
oh my god are you joking
what the hell
camera focus oh my god that was like the
tiniest little swatch by unexcited now
I'm ready I'm just gonna use my Sigma
tapered highlighter brush which is an
f-35 this is why I always always always
use the highlighter and the bronzer
brush that I used was a mac 135 because
I do have quite a few questions on these
brushes for some reason it's so soft as
well oh my god holy that is
gorgeous right I'm saying it right here
right now this 109 is a dupe for the
makeup forever pro-life fusion in 0-2
what I use all the time it looks the
exact same on my skin the exact same let
me actually get it out oh my god no joke
it looks and feels the exact same that
is the l'oreal one let me try and like
okay so those are the shades there
that's like a better representation I'm
not even joking
this is like the closest thing I've
seen in my life to that highlighter what
the hell oh my god it's so pretty you
need like the tiniest bit as well like
the tiniest bit Wi-Fi not to anyone talk
about this I'm not seeing anyone talk
about this and it's actually stunning
I'm sorry but what the that's dry
as well that is dry right okay so don't
go out and buy that stick don't go out
and buy the highlights if you don't need
it go and get this I can't get over it
I'm never gonna be over it this is like
a life-changing though I've never been
this it like I've not been this excited
about a makeup product in a long time I
mean what the hell gonna use California
by benefit look at that benefit just to
tie everything together okay so I just
went ahead and finished off the under
eye and also my lip off-camera
I'll link everything down below as
always if you're interested in where
anything else is from I can't get over
this I cannot get over this highlighter
and the skin like everything just feels
and looks really nice it doesn't feel
heavy if you like my skin it does look a
bit more texture than normal that's the
only thing especially in these regions
but other than that L'Oreal didn't come
to play I'm gonna go anyways I'm gonna
edit this video I might upload early
like that's how excited I am about this
video but I hope you've enjoyed watching
I love you guys to the moon and back a
million times over and I'll see you in
at the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
