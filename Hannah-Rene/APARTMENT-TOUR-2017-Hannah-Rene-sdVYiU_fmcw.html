going to say that every single product
will be linked down below so like all my
bedding I'm going to do my best to link
as many things as possible like my
lights my Betty and everything you could
possibly think of I'll put it in the
description bar below so this is the
biggest bedroom this is like the master
bedroom if you like which I actually use
for filming videos so this is the second
bed which is also used as a guest room
for when I've got like family and
friends seen over
I took everyone's recommendations and
put fairy lights up on the wall but I
didn't nail them I use those like
command hooks and so yeah it's nice and
cozy both beds have the same layout so
my bed's I sleep in as well has the
exact same layout but this is more like
the cool toned room because the bed that
came in the flat has a grey headboard
and so I decided to be that great
bedding to match it and then the other
one has beige bed in so when you look
around to the right of the room you have
all this free space here which is why I
use this as a filming room because I
thought it'd be perfect to put a desk
and all my makeup in there so this is
like my makeup collection area if you
want a separate video that's like a
makeup collection and let me know and I
can do that and but this is pretty much
myself
in case anyone ever wants to know so
again I'll do my best to link everything
below and these are just two Alex
drawers and then some acrylic drawers on
top that contain pretty much all of my
makeup and all of like my hair products
and my skincare products and things like
that then when you come out of that room
that is a bathroom there which I didn't
bother showing because it's kind of
boring it's just like a shower and a
toilet and a sink and then you walk
through the hallway and my bedroom is on
the right here so this one is a little
bit smaller than the other bedroom as
you can see like I said this has a beige
headboard and beige bedding so it's
pretty much the same layout like I love
excessive bedding I love so many
cushions on the bed at blanket throws
you name it I love getting out of bed I
feel like it's just a centerpiece of a
room and all of the bedside tables and
the wardrobes came with the flat as well
I will just say so
I pop two bedside table lamps on each
bedside table I put a little and like
fairy
might around the headboard and then I
didn't mention this in the other room
but as you can see here both bedrooms
back out onto my like balcony terrace
space which is really handy and they
both actually has sliding doors which
open out onto the terrace which
stretches all the way around the flight
is so cool it's really handy when it
gets super hot so it means I can just
open the door and let fresh air in and
it keeps me nice and cool this is how I
decided to move the furniture around so
as I said the wardrobes do come with the
flat I didn't buy them so I don't know
whether from and but the mirror my dad
made for me if you've seen my 18th
birthday blog then you will know I
literally cry throw the whole top blog
so with a watch like it's hilarious and
but my dad very kindly had made that for
me and I love it so much so I popped
that on a chest of drawers and then all
of my clothes are in there and I keep a
little door stuffers to make sure that
the dog doesn't market because I do run
this fast I can't damage anything and
then right at the end of the hallway is
all of the living space so this is the
first thing that you see when you walk
in and this is a clothing rail from Ikea
and I just use this to hang all my coats
that overlock because you know me and
then it's got a little handy section at
the bottom as well which holds shoes and
then I've got and one of the I think
these are called calyx like display
units again from Ikea I'll pop them
below and I just filled this with like
little artificial greenery and like
candles it's all very like monochrome
well like white black greens because I
like stuff nice and simplistic and
minimal and that print is from makeup
forever actually took it myself and then
I've got my silver play button which I
just treasured
so much that's a little bit the black
roses as well from Endora and travel
center if you wondering I got them for
like pops and black roses in that for me
and then over to the right I love this
space so much this is like my workspace
now which is where I'm actually sat
right now recording this voiceover so
this is again a desk from Ikea
honestly this flight is just for back
here it's such handy furniture and I
pretty much just finished putting this
together so there's a calendar here
which I printed off I got on Etsy which
I'll again link it below which is on a
clipboard I've got a weekly planner and
then all of this stuff like all of this
artwork on the wall which I just feel
like makes the plot so much more homey
and interest in and again it's all
matching like the theme of like the
green and the black and the white so
this is my workspace I love it it's so
sort of like
open space and the lamp is so so handy
the computer like I just loved sitting
here and working it makes everything a
lot less like work the chair is one that
came with a flat but the cushion is from
Zara I got it from the Zara home store
in chapter Center I don't honestly still
have them in stock they were very
popular but I'll try and find it online
so that is what that area looks like and
then when you look around a little
further this is the sort of seating area
with the sofa and a lounge chair and a
coffee table I've got all of my new home
cards at the top of the sort of TV unit
because I just love them so much and
then I've got TV which is just the
Panasonic TV which I popped in the
coffee table the sofa and the armchair
and the TV unit all came with the flat
so that I don't know where they're from
this is the terrace space which
stretches round and then on at the
coffee table I just popped some mats a
fruit ball and a big coffee table book
some remote for the TV and then these
are the questions that are on the sofa
which are all pretty much from Dunelm l
like this it's done almost so good
because it's really affordable but they
do really good job and behind the sofa I
have my keyboard which I love I never
really get to play anymore well I didn't
used to intelligent home cuz I didn't
have the room for it but I did used to
play a lot of piano and keyboards - lies
why I put it up there because I finally
have the room for it now and then I
popped a big full-length mirror I was
determined to have a massive mirror when
I moved out because I've always wanted a
big full like one so you've probably
seen it on my Instagram once or twice
and then this is it the table and chairs
which came with the flat the maps I got
myself a pot below and use the same axle
on the coffee table as well and then all
this left is the kitchen
so this is the kitchen space is just
some chopping boards kettle sugar
toaster nutribullet microwave all the
essentials you know the drill and then
also like an oven it's all electric and
my flats that's like the electric hob
and stuff like that and then it's just
the sink so that is pretty much
everything I'm going to pop a little
clip in of the sunset as well because
I'm super lucky in the sense that my
flat overlooks the sunset at night which
is so cool cuz I get to see it's at
every single night so yeah I really hope
you all enjoyed this video thank you so
much for watching if you've got any
questions or anything like that
let me know it down below but other than
that thank you for watching I love you
guys from in the back and I will see you
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
