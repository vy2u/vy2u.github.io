course I hope you had a wonderful New
Year's Eve a New Year's Day just a
celebration of the new hair with family
and friends I know I did
slash will be because I am actually
filming this on New Year's Eve but I
thought I'd kick start 2018 with a 2017
beauty favorites because there are a lot
of products that I absolutely fell in
love with that last year and I do tend
to do these each year and you guys seem
to really enjoy them
so I've managed to keep it really strict
this year as well I wanted to make sure
that I didn't have more than two
products apart from lips because I feel
like lips is quiet there's a lot of
products you know going on in the lip
region but I wanted to keep it really
strict so I pretty much just got one or
two products for each category before
this video begins if you want to give
yourself a challenge then be sure to
pause it and leave a comment down below
telling me what products you think I'm
going to include because I would love to
know which of you actually know my faves
and know me really well but without
further ado boys and girls I'm just
gonna hop straight in so we're gonna
start with like primers I don't know if
I want to do moisturizers like I kind of
had this debate where I was like I'm
gonna do skincare but I feel like I'll
just include one or two products okay
I'm just gonna include one because I
feel like this 100% and needs a mention
so this is a moisturizer it's the CEO
Sunday Riley antitoxin moisturizer this
oh you know you guys already know how
much I friggin love this stuff it is so
booty good if you have an on strike and
this is all you need
I'm telling you right now this is all
you need in terms of moisturizer it
leaves your skin feeling so hydrated and
just juicy and moisturize we all know
juicy skin okay smells like oranges it's
got lovely packaging I've actually been
through one and a half of these this
year so I'm halfway through this one
I've already been through one this is
what it looks like inside it's a little
tub it's just so thick and so creamy and
balmy which I like in a moisturizer it
does leave your skin feeling a little
bit greasy at first if you apply as much
as me I wouldn't say greasy but it's
definitely there if that makes sense but
I really like that in a moisturizer I
like to know that it's really kind of
bare on my skin but honestly it's
expensive I'm not gonna lie I think it's
about sixty pounds which I know I know I
know okay but if you have the money to
spend or if you look in for something a
little bit more pricey to spend your
money on or say for example you've got
coming up then this would make a lovely
purchase I should honestly be like an
ambassador for this cream because I
swear it's all I use now I have actually
purchased some of the rodeo dragon's
blood stuff which is down there which is
why I'm looking that which I'm really
excited to try because that's supposed
to be amazing as well but so far this is
so hundred-percent my number one of 2017
and by far my number one skincare
product in general I'm not gonna bother
doing any other skincare bits if you
said you actually have a skincare
tanning and hair care routine I believe
it is which I'll leave on the screen
somewhere here if you want to check it
out anyway on to makeup the fun stuff so
starting with primers I have two that I
want to mention I don't know what I was
doing with my arms there so the first
one is the Galan law I never know you
always go to name it and I never know
this is the radiance concentrate with
pure gold base this one is brand new it
looks like I'm not used to it which is
true I haven't used it yet but I did go
through an entire one of these this year
which if you follow me on my social and
on you too of course you will have seen
me use this so again this is pricey and
I do buy these myself I don't get them
sent to me or anything like that the
fact that I bought a second one
regardless of how expensive it is it
kind of just shows how good I think it
is again if you've got an almost dry
skin it's like water jelly I always say
this and it makes no sense because what
the hell is water jelly but that's the
only way I can describe it if you want
something similar but a little bit more
inexpensive than the Hydra veil by
Illamasqua it's really similar and I'll
link them both down below with
everything else that's a little bit
cheaper and it's kind of like a similar
vibe but I don't know there's just
something about this there's just
something about this that I absolutely
love and as soon as I started using it I
could not put it down okay and then I
just want to quickly mention this as
well this is the Smashbox photo finish
primer water which kind of took the
place of like Michael on primer when I
run out of air it just became a go-to so
quickly because one it's such an easy
product to use it's just a spray that
should just spritz it all Obi's skin and
it's done and - it really works so I put
off - for ages because I was like primer
water come on yeah it's just super
hydrating on the skin I mean like I said
I have normal to dry skin so I always
need a primer that will make my skin
really hydrated before I go in the
foundation especially if I'm using a
more mattifying foundation
I've been doing it recently it's just so
easy and so quick but it works so well
and as you can see I've probably used
maybe like a quarter of this I probably
use like a quarter maybe two thirds of
this and I've used it constantly since
august-september time I would say and
it's definitely you know lesson really
well okay foundations foundations
foundations it was so hard to pick two
the first one that had to be this was
not an option this 100% had to be in my
2017 favorites this is the Giorgio
Armani power fabric again you guys know
I feel like I don't even need to speak
about this anymore because I just rave
about it so much but it's honestly one
of the best foundations I ever used so
it's a longer hike cover Foundation and
it is mattifying I get mine in the shade
six this just takes all the boxes it's a
full coverage you can't make it more
like a sheer coverage if you want to but
I love the way it looks full coverage
doesn't feel heavy on the skin it builds
really well you can put layers on top of
layers it is more mattifying but being
someone who has drier skin if I use a
hydrating base like the moisturizer and
the primer I'm absolutely fine with it
and it doesn't even look matte on the
skin which is the really cool thing it's
just very comfortable very comfortable
very lightweight but gives you a really
flawless finish and then I do want to
include this little guy this is the w7
genius feather-light foundation in the
shade buff it's just such a special
little foundation in my collection I've
never worn this on its own believe it or
not I've still never worn this on its
own mostly because it's the wrong shade
I should probably get a different shade
and try it out I've heard a couple of
people say that it's a really good joob
for Giorgio Armani luminous silk by
itself because it is more of like a
sheer luminous foundation
I just love mixing this with stuff it
makes such a good mixer for foundations
because a lot of the time I go to
foundations online so I kind of have to
just guess my shade and hope for the
best and a lot of the time I end up
getting something too dark too light
whatever it may be but anything that's
too dark
this just mixes so well it makes
consistencies say like more mattify and
more like full coverage consistencies it
makes them a lot more lightweight and
chewy on the skin as well this is just a
little pocket of Stardust for me it just
holds a really special place in my heart
now because it really blew me away like
I didn't expect a lot of it
a lie I did do a full w-7 testing video
so I'll put it on the screen somewhere
here and it's only about six seven
pounds or so so again the price is a
hundred percent right for this it's just
it's just a gem it's just my baby
what can see list I only have one
concealer to mention it was an absolute
no-brainer
this is NAS radiant creamy concealer
which again I feel like for so long I
just didn't buy even though it's always
been it's always been quite a hyped
product everyone usually raves about
this so I got it in two shades I get
vanilla and custard vanilla is a little
bit lighter and a bit more like a pink
undertone I would say whereas custard is
definitely more of a yellow undertone so
I do like to and they use coasted by
itself or mix the two together it's what
I've got under my eyes right now it just
always looks really flawless always sits
on my skin really well it doesn't crease
too bad anything like that lasts for a
really long amount of time really good
to set with a powder and not dry in just
everything that I could want it in a
concealer is this so this is in my go-to
if you want a Jew that's more affordable
at Maybelline fit me love that as well
okay in terms up at setting powders the
only one that I want to mention is Too
Faced
this is the Born This Way a wreath roll
setting powder it just comes in one
shade I believe so Too Faced very kindly
sent me this in PR so thank you I
appreciate that
this has been going for a really long
time now so I've used Laura Mercier I
then used hacia made like the no color
powder and I do I did really like them
but they were really drying on my skin
it's really hard sometimes I think when
you're normal to dry skin to find a
loose powder that doesn't make your skin
look like chalk but all in all this is a
go-to I can actually set my whole face
with this as well it's what I used to
insert to set my entire face and my
under eye which I have never experienced
with a setting powder before it has kind
of like a yellowish tone to it it's kind
of like a translucent powder but it's
got like a yellow yellowish tone I would
say so it's really nice for it setting
on to the eyes to brighten and I've
still got a lot of this left I use this
every single day like I said under my
eyes and to set my entire face and I've
used it for a while but it's still going
really strong so I don't hundred percent
recommend this if you're on the hunt for
a good loose setting powder okay on to
bronzes and highlights so I've literally
I just honestly there's only two that
I'm I really wanted to include in this
video
and there wasn't really much else that I
could think of that is like something
that stuck with me the entire year so
I'll do brunches first because I do have
a pallet to go with it so the first
product which is by far one of my
favorite products ever this is the
makeup forever
makeup forever this is the pro a bronzed
fusion I have it in the shade 25 I
cinnamon it just again never lets me
down honestly makeup forever has a
really special place in my heart I love
the people that I love the brand and
they make bloody good products boys and
girls I'm telling you right now I know
they're expensive I know they're
expensive in the high end but they are
worth every single penny base products
in particular you guys know I love Make
Up For Ever HD stick one of their step
one primers that's like the hydrate and
one absolutely obsessed with it I
actually lost it which is kind of sad
the bronze is the highlight is let me
get onto the highlight is in a minute
more than girls but honestly I've hit
pan on this I don't think I've ever hit
pan on a bronzer other than this in my
life because that is how much I use it I
use it 24/7 it's kind of a little bit
luminous I don't know if you can see it
in the pond the reason this one's a bit
glowy is because it ends in an eye so
like I said this is 25 I which is
iridescent I believe and they do do Mac
versions of these but for someone like
myself who prefers a matte bronzer this
works really well doesn't look glowy on
the skin it doesn't look highlight E if
that makes sense there's no shimmer or
glitter to it it just looks really
healthy and I feel like because it has
the kind of iridescent finish to it the
product itself is really really soft and
it blends really well again if you have
dry skin like me and this is such a good
product I just can't say enough good
things about this honestly I'm obsessed
with there it will always be a love of
mine is waterproof as well I think is it
waterproof
yeah it's waterproof as well what more
do you want so this would be perfect for
holidays too and then something that
I've been using it more towards the end
of the year when did I start using this
again it was it was definitely when I
moved back home and I kind of went
through all my makeup and stuff it must
have been like September time this is
the UH Nastasia Beverly Hills contour
kit and I've just fallen back in love
with it it's something that I used to
use all the time when I first I do in
YouTube and first started kind of
getting into makeup and things but it's
just something that I kind of forgot
about mainly because
is the one thing that doesn't know me
about this is the pun sighs it's just
really annoying to me I have quite a
large bronzer brush I have a mac 135
which is like a really big like chunky
bronzer brush I use it in all my
tutorials it's just like a Whitehead
brush and it does not fit in the pans
very well at all so it's kind of
difficult to pick up like an even amount
of product in each pan I think that was
the reason why I kind of stopped using
it but either way the actual powders
themselves are incredible they blend
really well
they're very pigmented so I always try
and use a really light hand with these
because you don't need a lot at all and
I do really like this one this is the
light medium and I feel like I never
really used the lighter shades but I
feel like the contour shades this one in
particular at the end it's a lot warmer
than the rest so you can use it for
bronzer but then you can use the cooler
ones to contour so it gives you a bit of
an all-in-one situation okay also
highlighter and 100% the star of this
year the star of the show so this again
is by Makeup Forever you guys know you
already know what this is okay so this
is the pro light fusion so it's
basically the same product as the
bronzer but a highlighter
can we just look at the pan okay it's
what I've gotten today it's what I wear
in basically every single video because
it's pretty much the only thing I wear I
love it to pieces and that's not with a
wet brush I don't apply it with a wet
brush or anything like that it doesn't
need it it's so blinding by itself they
do this in two shades so this is the
shade I think it's two unless they've
expanded the range but the last time I
checked they do this in two shades so
this is the number two and the number
one is a more pale kind of pinky shade
for fairest skin just honestly this is
like my dream product I wish I created
this honestly I wish I create this
because it's just so fab it just melts
into the skin it's got no glitter
anything like that it's just got a
really lovely high shine Sheen if you
know what I mean that rhymed it just
melts into the skin it just makes you
look wet and juicy and glowy which again
we all want to be juicing glowy
you know how it is if you need a good
highlighter try this out there's makeup
forever stores in Debenhams Manchester
like travel center and Arndale now I
believe so you can go and try this you
don't have to just get it online
anymore I can't say enough good things
honestly there is nothing nothing bad
about this product it never lets me down
okay on to some brows again I've just
got two products so the first one is a
benefit product this is the precisely my
brow pencil and I kind of went back and
forth with using this and goof proof
brow pencil by benefit earlier this year
this one is just what I've gravitated
towards more recently because it's more
of a precise brow pencil hence the name
what shade is this this is the shade for
I'm not actually use this one yet
because I'm currently using at the shade
5 but you can just see that it's got
such a fine tip to it reason I like brow
pencils like this is because they're so
good for creating the illusion of hairs
because the like the pencil is so thin
you can just draw strokes and it looks
like natural brow hairs so if you love a
good natural brow or if you've got full
of brows and you don't really need to
fill them in but kind of want something
a little bit extra this would be such a
good product because it's really creamy
I'm really easy to apply as well and
then what I've been using it more
recently more so this is the anastasia
dipbrow in the shade dark brown and this
I kind of went off like I used to use it
all the time I use the shape blunt when
I had like to have which is way back in
a day now if you remember the light hair
then you've been here a long time dark
brown it just fits my hair color so well
at the minute it's not too warm it
doesn't look too red on my brows because
I don't like anything red at all but
it's not like so cool that it's gray if
you know I mean it's just like a really
nice in-between that is what the pomade
looks like the only thing with pomades
is they kind of get dry obviously but I
just use one drop of my L'Oreal
extraordinary face oil every now and
then just put it in and just kind of
like mix it round with a brush and it
will last for ages that one drop of oil
it's just so good for like defining it
giving a really nice shape ever since
I've been doing a more defined brow
again and kind of do my brows first
rather than other makeup it just it's so
good
I love using a brush as well I went
through a phase where I just used brow
pencils and just use a goof proof and
precisely my brow which I absolutely
loved it kind of gave more of a texture
brow but I forgot how much I loved using
a brush like just an angled brush so if
you browse a must-pass or if you like a
more fuller defined like Instagram brow
like myself then 100% recommend this it
lasts a really long time as well and if
it does get dry just pour a drop of face
oil or whatever in and it will help to
just bring it back to life okay I'm
making progress we're on to eyeliner and
mascara the first eyeliner that I want
to mention so I picked out one pencil
and one sort of like liquid gel to
create a wing so the pencil is by
Giorgio Armani this is the waterproof
smooth silk eye pencil in the shade one
which is just black if I've only had
recently so it's kind of a cheeky that
I've included yet I'm not gonna lie I
got this one of me Miriam and Mads went
to Armani in Liverpool they very kindly
gifted it me so thank you so much do you
like I've just never found my perfect
black eyeliner until this point my
perfect like black kohl
it was just always something I didn't
like about ones that you use either they
weren't pigmented enough they kind of
tugged on my eyes my eyes are so
sensitive
okay honestly I usually have to apply
lashes like two or three times before
they actually stay on my eyes don't
water because they are so sensitive
anyone's got a good lash glue please
recommend this for sensitive eyes but
they're just so sensitive the minute I
put anything in the world line lashes
anything like that they just wanna water
so I don't like anything that tugs on my
waterline because it just kind of
prolongs the process and it just
irritates there's a lot of things
because my eyes are so watery they don't
stay in place and they just run off or
run down my face or whatever throughout
the day this one just stays in pot
really well and the thing that I like
about it is it is super super pigmented
super black and it just applies in one
go you just have to do one swipe and
it's John so a lot of the time I use
this to tightline it does actually come
with a smudger on the other side which
is handy obviously but I don't really
reach for it cuz I do use it mostly just
for the waterline I'll do a little swipe
so you can see there sorry that's like
such a random swatch but you can kind of
just see how smooth and pigmented it is
SuperDuper black really comfortable on
the eyes it's just become my favorite so
I feel like fingers crossed unless I
find about one I found my favorite black
eyeliner which is fab and then in terms
of liquid I've got another makeup from
product so this is the ink liner
eyeliner
matte liquid eyeliner makeup forever do
a ton of different liquid liners but
this is my favorite one
firstly because it is so super black
it's what I used to do my wings today
and it's literally just the eyeliner I
didn't put any black eyeshadow or
anything like that on top light really
easily it's really easy to apply I never
used to like liquid liners because I
just find them really hard to use but
this kind of transferred me and now I
really struggle to use gel because I
find them quite dry the applicator is
amazing this one is nearly running out
now I mean it pretty much has run out
and I really need to buy a new one but
it's one of those things that I just
always forget to pick up but the
applicator is it kind of its kind of
skinny but fat at the same time like
it's fat enough to just apply it really
quickly but you can still get a really
nice sharp point with it which is
amazing I just love this that's all I
have to say I love this okay mascara
wise you guys know I'm not really a
mascara kind of girl because I tend to
wear lashes and stuff more but I thought
I would give this a cheeky mention this
is the max fat Max Factor 2,000 calorie
waterproof mascara which I originally
got because Emily Canham raves about
this and recommends it and I was like
her lashes always look bomb though I
decided to pick up myself and I fell in
love as well this is just so good for
keeping a curl my lashes they're very
sparse because I feel like I picked them
out from taking mascara and taking
lashes off but the length of them isn't
actually that bad and it always used to
book me whenever I put mascara and stuff
on because they're like they're long but
they just fall really fly it just used
to book me because it basically looked
like I had no lashes on if you know I
mean no eyelashes is what I'm trying to
say well I pretty much just cowl my
eyelashes with an eyelash curler and
then I applied one coat do the other
side and then do one more coat one see
once once each coat is dried and it's
just stays upheld it stays curled so
well my lashes look really long and the
only thing is with it being waterproof
it is a bitch to get off okay I do
really struggle to get this off but I do
find it worth it given the effect it
gives my lashes compared to other
mascara so I've been loving this since I
bought everything in terms over lashes
themselves I picked out two pairs one of
them I mean you might be able to guess
both but one of them is definitely a
lash that I have just raved about all
year it's probably been my lash of 2017
so these are little ashes Jay makeup
which just looked like so I made sure to
save a brand new a fresh path you got
hey so you could see what they look like
before I get them all struggling and
mingun but only annoying thing about
these is they are mink they claim to be
cruelty-free but I mean how cruelty-free
kind of mink lashes be I don't really
know I am conscious of the fact that
they are mink and I'm trying really hard
to find other things to replace them at
the minute I've been using a lot more
foaming blushes and stuff like that I
just love how fluffy they are I mean I
know they're upside down sorry you can
just see that like they're so fluffy I
love the way they're separated they look
really full but really natural at the
same time I can wear these without a
winged liner and they don't look too
crazy or anything like that they just
look lovely on the eyes so those who me
or go to the only thing that annoys me
about Lily lashes is they fall apart so
easily really winds me up like I tried
to be so careful picking off the glue
and yet it never works
yeah the lashes always fall apart
sometimes you're really lucky and you
get a pad that's like completely
resistant and they just don't fall apart
at all but a lot of a lot of the time
with the kind of mink has will fall out
which is super annoying so that's the
only thing - very - they are pricey if
you want something a little bit more
sturdy a little bit cheaper and a little
bit more reliable and even heavier
these are Rodeo Drive buy backstage
lashes and again I fell in love with
these this year I can't remember the
first time I use them I feel like it
might have been 2016 which feels like a
lifetime ago now so these are cheaper I
do have a discount code for them as well
not to like plug-in obviously if you
want to use it it's that if you don't
want it that's fine but it does get you
10% off so I'll leave it in the
description bar below with everything
LLC's are a lot heavier I don't know if
you can see let me just say go you can
kind of see there so there are a lot
more fuller than the J makeup ones so I
only ever wear these when I've got quite
a heavy smokey eye on and I've got a
winged liner because I do find them
difficult to blend if I don't have a
winged barn I also just find them like
way too full on my eyes without a wing
on so whenever I've got a heavy look and
I want to add even more drama these are
just a go to their cruelty free as well
I'm pretty sure that like silk lashes
a really fat range of inexpensive
cruelty-free faux mink lashes so I'll
link them down below these are probably
my favorite so far they have just
released some more which I'm really
excited to try oh my god I completely
forgot to do eyeshadow sorry I just
picked out one palette for eyeshadow
because I use a lot of different things
and I like to try it a lot of different
things but the only palette that I take
away with me and take on holidays and
just really grab when I need it like
it's what I've gotten today because it's
just easy and it always works
this is the anastasi Beverly Hills at
modern renascence palette which did I
start using it this year or maybe last
year mine is filthy okay
mine has been through some hard times
and some good times it's just such a
good palette the color combination is
incredible I love the Reds in here I've
never found any red eye shadows that I
love as much as these because they
genuinely look red on the eyes and not
pink because a lot of Reds go really
pink on my eyes for some reason blends
really well super pigmented like you
have to be really careful because it is
a little bit too pigmented sometimes um
I'm sorry palettes in general I really
like I didn't mind Suburbia I know a lot
of people hated that I didn't really
mind it and then Prison palette which
came out at Christmas time I did really
liked as well so go twos easy to use
just always reliable oh my god and I
think we're pretty much just onto lips
now so that was everything we've just
got lips laughs so like I said I haven't
picked out more than two products of
course for lips but I did want to make
sure even though I picked out more I
still kept it really concise and really
just what I absolutely love and swear by
so the first product is a lip liner I
just wanted to take one good noodle up
liner that absolutely swear by and have
used a lot in 2017 and that is the
Makeup Forever aqua lip and this is in
the shade 1c it's what I've got on today
too lined my lips I'll do a little
swatch you swatch heat down here so you
can see what it's like but it's
basically just a nude peach as you can
see that formula of these because they
are waterproof lip liners they're very
waxy and in a sense they're really good
to apply in that way because they last
really long on the lips it's not easy to
rub them off if you know what I mean
they really kind of adhere to the skin
but this book is just my favorite
because it creates a really nice kind
outlined for any nude lip color that I
like to use I also just like to use this
and kind of fill my hole at lips in with
it lasts a really long time really
comfortable on the lips because it's
more waxy and not as much a pencil it's
not that dry in and then I have a four
lip products that I kind of wore with
that lip liner
I've only chosen nude lip products for
this year I sometimes choose reds and
stuff I was like you know what I don't
really use Reds that much so there's no
point including them I just wanted to
include what I really kind of use a lot
so what I've gotten today which I'll
talk about first this is a lipstick by
L'Oreal this is the one in collaboration
with balm on which is urban Safari I
don't know if these limited edition so
I'm really sorry if they are it's just
such a good nude though for some reason
I struggle to find nudes that are like
pale enough for my liking at the
drugstore
L'Oreal do some really good ones and
Maybelline have a really good range of
pale nude lips as well but there's
something about this one that just
really took my heart this year it's what
I've gotten stayed like I said really
comfortable on the lips it reminds me a
lot of myth by Mac which is obviously a
lot more expensive bomb Mila is really
nice it has a really nice fragrance and
the packaging is super cute really good
to just like throw in your bag on top
and like I said less well and it feels
super comfortable and then in terms of
liquid lipsticks the first one I've got
is the Rimmel stay matte I'm in the
shade at latte to go which I remember
when I use this and it was in a first
impressions that I filmed at the fly
it's definitely more of a brown nude as
you'll see now but I literally wore it
for days and days afterwards so it's
that color down there obviously it's not
dried yet which is why it looks at shiny
as you can see it's a lot more Brown
than the l'oreal one and slightly dark
as well but it just looked so lovely on
the lips felt really comfortable I love
the packaging didn't feel drying at all
because some liquid lipsticks really dry
my lips out especially with the gloss on
top as well it felt really comfortable
it didn't really have to top it up too
much
the only thing with these is they do
need a good few coats to make them super
opaque but for the price it's incredible
and then one other liquid lipstick that
was definitely more of a sort of early
2017 hype for me was the Anastacio
little lipstick in the shade
I'm not gonna get this one out and
swatch it and because this is actually a
brand new one
I don't know where my old one has gone
it's just one for walkies what that is
what these shade looks like that it's
kind of like a peach color I'll try and
link a video on the screen here where
I've used it so if you want to see what
it looks like on then you can check out
that video that these are so opaque
these don't need a lot of coats at all
they need one coat pretty much these are
definitely a little bit more drying I
would say but I usually pay a liquid
lipstick with a glass so it doesn't
really matter too much for me the color
is fab and it lasts really well so if
you want to spend a little bit more
money then I would definitely recommend
this fan that I have two glasses that I
kind of pad on top of those so the first
one is NYX a fortune cookie which is
just a goatee for me I've actually mixed
these two today so I kind of have them
both on at they're very similar one is
just the next one which is quite a lot
cheaper so fortune cookie is up that
these just have such a lovely kind of
high shine effect to them what was that
I don't know they smell really yummy
they smell so yummy
the packaging is super cute super dinky
they're really inexpensive as well I'm
pretty sure they're like 4 or 5 pounds
last a really good time as well it just
make your lips look juicy juicy juicy
and then the one lip gloss that I was
obsessed with as soon as I try this
I actually got sent this by Beauty Bay
in October so I know it's a bit of a
late trend but ever since I've just not
stopped using this this is the dose of
colors undressed I'm pretty sure
so I'll swatch it next to fortune cookie
and they're definitely different kind of
formulas in the sense that this one has
a lot more color payoff so I've got them
dressed up here which as you can see is
a lot more opaque and then we've got
fortune cookie here which is kind of a
similar shade fortune cookies just a
little bit lighter but it is quite a
fair bit sharer so it just depends what
you like because I know some people do
like a really pigmented gloss that kind
of add color on top of a lipstick or
just a pair with a lip liner and then I
know some people do kind of like just to
have a shiny kind of top coat for a
lipstick this though feels really
comfortable the thing I love about this
compared to fortune cookie o is the
applicator is so much nicer because it's
like a doe foot and it kind of is flimsy
so you can kind of bend it and get into
all the nooks and crannies of your lips
if you know what I mean it's just
something about it I love always just
finishes a lip off really well but yeah
that is pretty much everything that I
fell in love way
and everything that was a go-to for me
in 2017 so feel free to let me know what
yours were in the comments down below
