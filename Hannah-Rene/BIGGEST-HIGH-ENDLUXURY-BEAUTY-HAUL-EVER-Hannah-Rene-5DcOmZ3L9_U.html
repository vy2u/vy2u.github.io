background boys and girls I am so
excited to be on this video I've been
more in fulfillment for so long our I've
had the videos we cover I was in the
Cotswolds then I was in Paris now
watching about the piece of revives with
this video and because I wanted to film
it so much so as you can see I'm in
India background hum so this is
basically part of my filming and like
makeup room now I'm obviously like
testing this out let me know what you
think this is basically to tell Alex
shows in the back I've got some makeup
in and then look like a little hater
hater on top help you is that I was like
come on huh and then as a lipstick power
and compare fumes and like some acrylic
boxes and things like that so let me
know what you think of this as a
background it's like too busy or too
much going on and honestly just tell me
because I want to know we see but you
know um but yeah hi so the today's video
is a high-end beauty haul because I did
a lot of online shopping at not too long
ago I have to say this was also of
accumulated over maybe like a month or
two I literally had to resist so hard to
open these boxes and now that they're
open and I've laid it all out on the
table and what the holy I am so friggin
excited there's a lot of stuff please
don't think I'm too crazy like as I said
it was bought over like multiple shots
and I didn't buy all this in one but
there's a lot of things my love so
getting in sit down and get comfortable
I'm going to go through still in the
order that applies on to your face and
then I'm going to do skincare so itself
in it with primer so this is by good
luck I think that's how you say honestly
I am the worst when it comes to
pronounce names but I'm pretty sure the
brand is called Galan this is that law
radiance concentrate with pure gold
primer I have seen so many people on
YouTube
using this raving about this like just
luminous so this is what it looks like
it was very expensive from primer I was
like it's basically a it's kind of like
a clear liquid and then it's got gold
it's actual it's got real gold inside of
it and yeah I'm pretty sure it's like
meant to give you sort of like a radiant
luminous face to then apply foundation
on top I've never tried this before but
I was like I've seen it so many people
raving about it
having an ox I wanted to give it a go
myself and see if it was worth the money
because I feel like it was about 38
maybe like 40 pounds of go abroad primer
a lot of money the second primer that I
got was by Charlotte Tilbury I got a
bunch of child troublemaker because I've
been one of you at Peston video and
around Charlotte Ober obviously I've
been doing a lot of like drugstore and
formal ones recently and I feel like I'm
going to do some high-end ones as well
because obviously with high-end products
like the products have to be good for
you want for you to want to invest your
money and it's hard to know sometimes if
you just like read the reviews online
and stuff so I've got quite a lot of
Charlotte Tilbury in this haul so the
primer that I got is Wonder glow and it
says consumable pink packaging which I
thought was really cute and it says
instant class focused BC flash so yeah
and you basically can use it under
foundation over foundation I'd like a
liquid highlighter and guess in or on
its own as like a cream yeah it does
turn around tired dull skin in a few
flashes migrate through hybrid anti age
elixir hopefully don't lead actor Shia
powered by a fluorescent call that
converts UV light skin luminosity for
instance also Chris spotlight effect can
be used under and over makeup on its own
so this is the packaging at which I love
I really like shallow cover break up
from people think it's like old ladyish
but I think it's really cute yeah it's
basically like a luminous
base and it does have a slight tint to
it I don't know why my hands look so
pale like excuse me feel quite thin and
it's got no little and you can write
that in it it just got like a really
nice sort of Sheen to it you're probably
not even able to see on the back of my
hand there and it feels very soft but
yeah I'm excited to try that I have to
say I've never used anything from
Charlotte Tilbury in terms of skincare
or like cream products of foundations
I've used the lip products and I think
that's it so I'm really excited some
video I don't know what you didn't want
to do it for let me know if you want it
to next week and I will do it and so
yeah that is the primer and then on the
foundation I got four foundations which
I do not need for foundations but the
foundations I just love and one it's
summer so I may as well show you the
Charlotte Calvert one first this is like
Wonder and it says it's a youth boosting
perfect skinnet foundation this was kind
of advertised a long time
underglow and i'm pretty sure because i
got even caught you see i'm pretty sure
they were sort of used together to
create like the skin on the module hand
and the skin looked lovely but said that
when it comes to foundation i have one
simple rule perfect coverage in a like
this at reasonable formula so I'm pretty
sure this is aim to be like a light to
medium coverage but still helps you to
look flawless and even and just pretty
you know so I got the shade it's six
medium and it looks okay it looks a
little bit lighter than walk on today
obviously much in foundations online is
the bane of my life again I'm really
excited to try this
it looks really lovely and luminous and
glowy I feel like this would be a really
nice foundation mixed with the Wonder
glow which is why I've got them together
because that's how I want to try them
out and and I do like even though I love
a full coverage I do like something a
little bit like that every now and then
especially we're going to summertime and
obviously they are in the midst of come
into spring at Mother's I call them it
because I bet you think I'm not all and
go speed for today and I think I'm not
walking up make my dream how long okay
we have to go we can remove even
avoidance of the music ataxia time yeah
even though I love a school coverage I
don't like anything that stick and I do
honestly enjoy like I like to medium
every now and then when my skin is
cooperating and so I'm really quick try
these obviously again shall tolerate
very high and very luxury Betsy worth
good money and this one's pretty boring
but I just got a new backer alternate
coverage foundation because those of you
who know me know that I love this
foundation is really really thick this
foundation I have a love-hate with even
though a little bit like sometimes
wasn't I'm even though I love it it does
make me work so hard to burn it out
because it's so thick and I just got a
different shade I got the shade at Shell
because the shades that I have at the
minute is called tan and it is super
dark so I have to have like a
they plan on floret and I wanted a pail
to light this is one of the more
Pharisees when I've got no flute turn on
because I'm kind of enjoying even though
I've got a dark relations minute I
happen enjoying recently we're in Newark
Nick I'm you know so I don't know a
foundation that I can wear alone when
I'm not going to VidCon because they're
all like us at least a couple of things
darker than my skin and so holiness is
going to match and I have a better shade
now so that I look like okay and then
these two foundations I'm so excited
about of it the first one is the
hourglass vanish a foundation stick
which I have heard so many good things
rot in it if you again if you know me
you know that I love my makeup private
stick is walk on today is so flawless
looks so spin at the same time like it
literally feels like nothing on your
skin it so it just makes you look useful
and a brush is so magical so this thing
this foundation is pricey and you do not
get that much compared to what you get
in and makeup grab it stick and I'm
pretty sure how many grams is this I'm
pretty sure it's something crazy like so
that yes seven point two grams compared
to the nickel pepper stick which I think
you gave up 25 grams in and that is
cheaper than what this is I wanted to
try it anyway those to let all of you
know I feel like this is my food
whenever i buy it was the makeup I'm
like I wanna try it so I can let
everyone else know if it was me or not
you know I'll pick once the teeth got
the shade it's done I'm gonna hope that
it's the right shade I won't like swatch
it right now and because another thing
that I want to teach you about as I've
been doing hi testing Tuesday videos I
kind of want to like mix it up a bit and
do not just like full runs but also do
like one products as well so like for
example just testing a foundation rather
than doing just like full faces every
time I feel like I would enjoy doing my
just one product as well are doing like
a full review and then if it's the
foundation I could test it out in the
morning and then do check-ins throughout
the day and let you know Matt saw the
other one I got is by Giorgio Armani
this is the power fabric again I kind of
bought this and I just do it with like a
full face of first impressions or to do
it on like a Tuesday I'd like a review
I'm pretty sure I would call those
videos by the way because it cameras on
my lips so Holy Grail
what do we think like this is a brand
new foundation by Giorgio Armani I
published it six because that is why you
see in luminous silk luminous silk I
enjoyed but I did enjoy it enough to
read by it so I only ever had one and
this is basically full coverage pretty
sure it's a matte finish which I'm not
the biggest fan of like natural matte
foundation but if I apply like I've got
amount of moisturizer and primer
underneath and they usually are fine
because the back of full coverage one as
well is kind of like a natural mark I
would say and so I'm really excited
because I feel like everyone loved
luminous silk and I liked it but I just
didn't like see the obsession with it I
guess so I'm afraid to try this let me
know if you want like a fill a whole
grail video on this and I will do one
and but if not they're not just included
in like full face or first impressions
or something like that instead in terms
of concealers I got - I got one by
Charlotte Tilbury again for this video
and this is the researcher conceal and
perfect I've never seen anyone use this
and I'm not really had anything about it
I didn't actually know she had a
concealer it just looks like this in it
the packaging it's one of the sort of
brushes one brushes one basically says
disguised imperfections paws and uneven
skin tone for a flawless face that is
smoother and more plump enriched with
black key extra so sounds interesting I
got the shades too she had a lot of
shades in this I believe and but yeah I
got this again kept in the video to use
like under the eyes and to conceal
ourselves because it's the only
concealer that she had I also got a
product I'll call ET which I bought just
because it sounded really interesting
again I've never heard anything about
this
from amazing cosmetics and it said it's
the world's best concealer that is what
this is called the world's best
concealer I was like okay so I got it in
the shade light golden it's if I hadn't
really good reviews which is why I
bought it because I was like is it
really going to be the world class
computer I wanna it looks like this and
packaging so it's basically a little 22
which I don't love what when concealers
converted for the attendees would be
we do things like freelance photographer
like a little bit more hygena it says
the celebrity makeup artist favorite
multi-purpose full coverage concealer a
small amount is realizing it to erase
any imperfection it could have really
the only concern I have about this is
that I'm worried it's gonna be quite
thick and then if it is all the observes
eyes or hopefully like it might be too
heavy under the eyes well hopefully it
wouldn't be and then it very quickly
again I got another Charlotte pilgrim
product which is a face powder and
because again I'm going to do a video
and he's like I was paralyzed how hard
is divided for awhile anyway because I
still casting lights raving about it
racial she did a series of videos where
she spoke about different kind products
and whether they're worth the money or
not and this is one that she said she
really enjoyed using so this is the
average flawless finish and skin
Perfector unit micro powder and I got to
shade it to medium there's only three
shades so that's like an issue with this
I would say I usually have these powders
a little bit lighter anyways because I
don't like them to change the color of
my foundation too much and so I'm going
to give it a go oh it feels really nice
it feels very finely milled again I love
the passion okay I got two new
highlighters so the first one is by easy
way and it's in the shade is 15 and
these were I will start on well for on
super out start for a while uncle DC and
then they came back and I had to get one
because they just look stunning
so this is the more paler gold shades as
like to sort of Goldy shades I think
that Lauren's called topaz and I like my
highlights be quite intense as you can
see I love that it's watch that I looked
so pretty
I do really enjoy from what I'm used of
she went so far that product oh my gosh
she looks so pretty
get it feels really fine but it's got a
really nice much pigmentation to it so
I'm really excited to try out it and
then this night product I honestly got a
flop myself a bite because it was so
expensive is by Estee Lauder it's part
of the Victoria bathroom range and this
recently came on to Selfridges and as I
was shopping it just caught my eye and
then I remembered that I watched a video
of Chloe Morello
and sort of reviewing like the full
range and I watch the whole thing and
the only thing that I was really like
impressed with whilst watching it was
the highlighter so when I saw it come on
on my Selfridges feed I was like it just
looks three right when she put it on at
the top of a t-bone
the minute she didn't want to watch it
was that group but that and I was like I
need that in my life so this is what it
looks like so start as the pattern feels
really lovely and really luxury it's
very heavy and very sort of steady which
is what you would expect because I'm
pretty sure this is like 45 pounds or so
it I've never spent 45 an island it has
got a slightly more rosy like rose gold
tone to it as opposed to like a gold
tone I would say but it just looks
really really pretty much people I
thought it's like that you can kind of
see the estee lauder
and then as you a1 and so it's a little
bit darker as well so it's something
that I will probably have to wear when
I've gotten on but it feels really nice
if you're so creamy it feels more creamy
than the issue a1 like almost a little
bit more like soft to the touch
if you know what I mean moving on to
eyes I am so excited about this product
so this is the GWT or the hood of ECI
havaianas not attending yeah this is the
hood of beauty textured it shadows
palette in it the rose gold edition so
again this is our uncle beauty so long
and then it finally came back and I was
like nice so it comes in a package in it
like so it's got a clear lid and then
you open it up and it sees all the
shapes here and so obviously well I'm
guessing a lot of you will have seen it
already the top row and this one here I
like the sort of foiled and intense
metallic textured eyeshadows and then
the rest of them are mostly luxe but
there's one shimmer here and these I'm
pretty sure a supposed to be a quiet
easy finger that's how they apply bath
and then obviously use like brushes and
the maps and things like that but I just
love the color scheme so much like
looking at this now out of the map bossy
is so many henna and sandalwood sorry
and then she'll scrubbed out of the
texture but it's really beautiful color
on more they do feel like very and
gritty the foiled ones because they're
like the textured shadows and not
like a normal oil shadow if you know
what I mean yeah they're like so busy
that they almost don't come off I'm not
going to lie like I'm kind of struggling
with those on my hand there and I'm
going to give them a go on my eyes and
I'll try them with like a face like a
shadow primer as on see how the girls
and Matt feel really soft
that was like one swatch and like that
pretty internal pigmented very finely
milled again it feels super lightweight
that I stumbled there so again if you
want me to do a tutorial on this don't
let me know if not then I'll just use it
and probably up close like an Instagram
and telling myself that I'm excited to
try it because I feel like it was very
hard to get your hands on for so long
and if you do want it cut you see in
your place again it just got a product
from Charlotte Tilbury this is the dolce
vita and luxury palette comes with four
shades that the one thing that i have to
say when i was shopping for at charlotte
silvery eyeshadow quad Alexa palette to
use in the video and not many of them
have maps I'm not gonna lie and that
kind of bothers me like I like a palette
to have maps and what the look that was
demonstrated on a model with this
palette looks so stunning that I just
have to get it anyway and I do really
love this look all the scheme of it's
it's quite warm quite coppery and quite
red so I'm going to give this a go in
the video obviously again these are
expensive so I wanting to me to sort of
pellet that you can like use by
themselves and you don't need like
another palette for if that makes sense
and for others just because it's not bad
my in we'll see how it goes
got two of these stealer and liquid what
these called magnificent muscles that
glitter and glue liquid eyeshadows
because so many people are happening up
and I've seen them in so many shoes or
elles that just makes me want them so
badly so the fusions that I ended up
getting at the first one is diamond dust
and it's a more silvery one and then I
also got molten midnight which is like a
black with an gold specks in it so I'll
do a quick swatch of these as well and
these look stunning like honestly I've
seen them in quite a few tutorial now
and they look really pretty like so
intensely pigmented and the are quite
chunky because obviously they're like a
liquid glitter I would say and I just
love the concept of these because
obviously they're so easy to apply with
the
you can just watch them straight on the
lid and really easy to work with it
really easy just like pop art and then
sat down with a powder if you wanted to
so that was the silver one and then the
black one which I'm kind of intrigued to
use because black creams I always get
worried that they'll transfer it into
the crease and what I'm excited to give
this one a go and see how it goes it's
like a black with silver reflex I would
say it's so so stunning honestly they
are beautiful so I'm really try to give
those a girl okay on to lips because oh

pretty sure I didn't get any like
eyeliners on the scars or lashes or
anything like that
I got a Charlotte Tilbury lip pencil in
the shade and pillows hard I've been
wanting this for a while anyway even
before I was thinking out in this video
the backgrounds like gone non blurry
it's really annoying me it's basically
just like a pinky nude just looks like
so now you can see right at the bottom
and they're not a standard like pencil
as in like a normal pencil and they're
kind of similar to like feel Pro
Longwear by Mac or the kind of cosmetics
lip pencils which I love the formula
pencils like these but I hate sharpening
them because you never get them to a
shop wind again and that is what really
pisses me off about there and what I do
always find that they are a lot prettier
than normal lip pencils so we'll give it
a go hopefully it will be easy to
sharpen and we are guys in the shape
channel talk i got a lip cream and by
marc jacobs because I saw this on John
Lewis and I thought it looks so
beautiful and this is the package in
super stunning obviously Marc Jacobs
sweetie I got really expensive really
high-end very luxury we really like the
color about that such a pretty nude so
it's down there as I said it's in the
shade it yours to try and it's got a
very warm undertone to it so I feel like
if you fast and it's like quite
fair-skinned you probably won't like
this because I never like a warm name on
me when I've got an expert on because
they just they make my teeth look quite
yellow they just don't complement my
skin tone very well whereas when you've
got like all the skin or like a little
bit of the time these sort of music
stunning and then onto brushes I got
three different brushes for the first
one is again from Charlotte Tilbury
activated just so much hearts are in at
all
like stoking up this video and I'm
didn't I only got one because my got
there and this one is the magic
complexion brush which I just thought
was like the best one to get because
it's basically the foundation in cream
products so it just gives you like an
overall idea of the quality of her
brushes I think because like a good
foundation brush is just a staple you
look using brushes like this and for
foundations because they give a really
sort of natural but flawless finish I
just hate that they're white because
they just look dirty so quickly you're
not engrossed by Sigma I'm not even
going to like try and get this out right
now because it's so difficult so my
suits in your package in this is the F
of three high cheekbones highlighter it
looks like so and it's basically like
what I usually use anyway by Sigma like
a tight-knit four feet brush and but the
one I use is like black and it's a
little bit too big for y one is whereas
this is like a tiny bit smaller and a
little bit more precise so when I pick
it off and give it a go and again it had
a real good review online so we shall
test it out and see how it go and then
the very last brush is kind of a random
one but I've got an old oh gosh
I got a whole garage and because I've
never really had like an oval brush that
mine like I'm using on shoots and stuff
and I've really enjoyed using there but
I never actually invested in one a
missed one it was awkward beauty and
again had a meat in it review so I
wanted to give it a go it's like a
really nice size don't mind me it's a
really nice size because it's not too
big if you know what I mean and so I
feel like you could use a foundation
cream contour or concealer and because
it's not like super super large and so
it's brought by a brand called IPC and
its feet skin brush
21 everything will be right down below
and as I said it just has a really good
review so I'm going to give it a go
foundation and because I'm always on the
hunt for a foundation brush onto being
had very quickly I decided to invest
quite a bit of money in some skincare so
the first thing that I got is by Sunday
Reilly and again this is uncle BCI I
wanna try them in by Sunday Reilly so
long
but obviously the price one price point
yet sorry console obviously the price
point is very high and so I decided to
invest in one product this is the UFO
the ultra car
a face oil and it's for blemish and
blackhead prone skin I've been getting a
lot of tension on my forehead recently
so I wanted to win that was aimed for
like a blemish and like problem skin if
you know I need and so it says this one
point five salicylic acid dry oil
clears congested pores while speeding
the appearance of fine lines wrinkles
and hydrating and purifying support so
it sounds amazing it sounds like just
what I need in my life and basically
yeah IBC oil so it just looks like so
I'm pretty sure it's meant for like
evenings and it says it can be used all
it smells really strong from the world
strong because it can be a quiet day or
night Jay all right after cleansing skin
massage and the skin at neck and chest
are needed so it's a dry oil and it will
absorb quickly which is obviously what
we all love and I'm very excited I get
of the smell it's really strong it
smells like and you know we've ever been
in like pharmacy and it just smells like
pharmaceutical and that's what it's not
like don't mind me yeah I'm very tight
chiness really excited because I want to
get more in skincare since I've come off
my contraceptive Phil Messick interested
in breaking out left right center so I'm
going to here I go and we'll see if it's
worth the money but it did have more is
a good review also a score Beauty I've
been wanting to try ready for ages this
is by Pisa Thomas Roth there's basically
a bunch of math on the website that is
by this brand and like all of them just
get really good reviews again so I
wanted to try it out this is the pumpkin
enzyme mask and it just looks like so it
comes in a massive party lab our product
just had really good reviews for
cleansing and like helped in again with
blemishes and like problem skin and
things like that so I wanted to give
that a girl it's not super expensive it
was like mid-range I would say and
obviously you got a lot of money and so
I'm excited because I'm always on the
hunt for a good mask that like help to
clear skin we got another mask by
origins
I love origins as a brand I've had a lot
kind of in the past and I do really
enjoy using them and this again is one
that I've seen quite a few people
talking about in the past so I thought I
would pick it up it's the ginseng appeal
of mouse to refine and refresh and yeah
it basically says falsifying with coffee
beans are gentle through acid complex
helps to lift away dead skin dull skin
and dirt while refining pause skin looks
smoother Plusnet back into shade yet as
you can actually peel it off as well I
love a good peel mask
I really do some excites try this it
basically supposedly helps you like
luminosity to sort of bright and like
dull skin and things like that which I
always need because my skin can go
through phases where I just look so
lifeless I always just one waste of like
adding a bit of hydration and a bit of
luminosity back into it whilst cleansing
and exfoliating at the same time so
origins is like mid-range again I would
say it's not super luxury but it's
definitely not drugstore like it's comfy
quite expensive and Advocaat leads under
lewis and creates try it because i've
had amassed by arjun so for like an
overnight one and i did really love it
my skin felt so hydrated afterward i
also got the origins Maximizer and skin
optimizing mask primer because I've
never had a primary before I wanted to
buy this mask or Smashbox one for ages
but then I saw this online and I've
never seen anyone talk about it so it's
basically am a prime in myth and so you
just sort of apply it to the skin
close your eyes on the lot and you can
apply it foundation and your watchful
makeup on top and then if you very much
things I got boys and girls it feels
like it's been going on forever and
these are actually brand new mouth by
origins and I love sheet masks so what I
love the ones by Sephora this is what
these are sheet masks and another one's
life is horrible obviously because
they're from Sephora I just struggle to
get a hand on them and then I saw these
on Selfridges and then new from origins
is basically a massive range and they're
like flower fusion masks and each
wonders of different things so the first
one is lavender and it's thought to deem
the skin and then as an orange one which
is for radiance boost in and also a rose
want to hydrate in as well it did have a
couple
well what and now I just got three test
them out there were five pounds I
believe which I do think is expensive
for a sheet mask because obviously use
it once and then goes in the bin and it
fit my perfect for everyday you know
just like put one on and to not have to
like fill the sink McMath and rich face
off and things like that they're just
really quick and easy and obviously
really good for your skin so I'm excited
cherries I hope I love them as much as
four on because I love those so much
that was everything oh my god I feel
like a slob so click which is no joke I
am now running late for my train and my
mom is gonna kill me
