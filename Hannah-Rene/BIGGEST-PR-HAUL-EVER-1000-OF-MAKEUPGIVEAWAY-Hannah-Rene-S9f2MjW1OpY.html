going to be a massive massive okay a
huge PR hole because I don't tend to do
these on my channel and then asin's
what's it the other day and a lot of you
said you really like them and you're
interested in seeing one so I thought I
would just pile together a bunch of
packages and let PR stuff that I've got
recently and basically put it in a video
and show you all show you all the good I
obviously just want to say I'm not
trying to brag or anything like that
I do actually want to form a bit of a
giveaway with these let me know in the
comments if you would like one and also
let me know which products you would be
interested in having in the giveaway
because obviously I want to know let me
know what you favorite things out and be
sure to give this video a thumbs up if
it gets like 5,000 likes I'll do a
giveaway I'll give you one we're gonna
try and sweep our everything really
quickly because there's a lot of stuff
and I know I tend to ramble so without
further ado the first round I'm going to
talk about is George Armani because
we've got the most Armani beauty
products and I recently went to our
money bc in liverpool like one of the
counters and Devlin's with Miriam and
lads had the best time ever basically
got our makeup done and stuff it was
just it was just shits and giggles like
it was so much fun
no Miriam very kindly sent over all the
stuff that was used on my face one of
the sort of and senior artists Zoey did
my makeup which I was in love with it
was stunning though the first thing that
she popped in at the parcel by the way
Miriam if you're watching which I know
you probably will be thank you so much
for all this stuff like I'm obsessed I
squeal like a baby pig when I opened it
so the first thing is a fragrance I'm
around comes her instead of me and mine
so like given this a sniff that's not so
weird and this smells
insane I can't even put it into words
I'm not even gonna try and pin help sick
so I'll actually butcher the name but
obviously everything I speak about in
this video and everything I haul will be
in the description box below Houston in
can we just look how stunning is the
packaging it first of all
it's so good it's so good it's so yummy
I wish you could smell this because I'm
really one of the worst people when it
comes to describe in sentence like I
don't know how you describe this in fact
let me get it open the website well this
is 200 pounds oh my god basically says a
color linked to the earth the meeting of
mineral and botanical a wreath royal and
powerful it's a feminine sensuality very
true it smells very like sensual and
kind of just mmm like you just put it on
it and you feel like sexy and yummy you
know delicately balanced floral
fragrance is both fresh and intoxicating
and leaving a soft yet lingering trail
it's just incredible I'm obsessed thank
you so much to Miriam for putting this
in because obviously it is a very
expensive high-end product but I cannot
wait to wear it and stuff and I'm just
I'm in love I'm in love I'm obsessed
okay so next up we have skincare
products which is obviously the first
thing that we used on the skin where we
did the makeup so these are the smart
moisture serum which I have actually
used before and it's basically just like
a really moisturizing serum that you can
use on the makeup and stuff and then
we've also got the day long
skin Perfector so it says it's advanced
skincare four day long makeup glow
instantly pause and shininess look
reduced foundation application is
improved so with both products you can
pretty much use them on a foundation and
stuff and they'll help to make you skin
look more healthy and glowy and also
like increase like prolong the wear of
your makeup you know I mean I'm really
excited to get these ago I actually
haven't tried this area even though I do
have one so this one will probably go in
a giveaway if you want it let me know
you've then got a bunch of foundation so
we've got a power fabric and a luminous
silk you guys I don't even need to use a
whole package name because you'd see me
use them so many times especially for
fabric and so the difference kind of is
like power fabric is a more mattifying
like Matt's assassin it finished
luminous silk is obviously a lot more
jewy and things like that I honestly
prefer even though I like glow and my
skin is quite dry I way prefer power
fabric I don't know why I like it just
looks way better on my skin it's what
I've got them today so I use the shade
six and half a break and 6.5 in
luminous silk and when we did my makeup
on the counter
Zoey mixed the 6.5 in the luminous silk
and the six in the PAL fabric it kind of
did that luminous silk all over and then
applied a pile fabric kind of like in my
t-zone and stuff and you just gave like
a really nice balance luck because I
looked like Matt or like more Matt where
I wanted to look more matte in my t-zone
and then looks glowy of the skin there
are mining it foundations and my
favorite things to do and all the rest
of the products from our money our like
products that I've not used before while
obviously used on my skin to do with the
makeup so the first thing we have is the
Sun fabric share bronzer in the shade
100
I'm guessing this comes in like
different shades I'm assuming but it's
in a little compact like so which is
also a similar concept compact to like
the luminous silk powder and things it
comes with a brush underneath as well
which I wouldn't tend to use this I feel
like we all always take that it looks
like just like a really sort of neutral
bronzey terra-cotta shade like it's not
very warm or anything like that which I
like because bren's is like this you can
use them to kind of warm up the skin but
also to sort of like define and contour
as well next up we've got the eye and
brow maistro' I think that's how you
pronounce it this is in the shade for
and we use this as a base on my lips I
believe and then also a little bit for
the brows but you can basically use
these on the brows or on the eyes it's
like a base kind of like amok Paint Pot
situation and then that is the shade
there oh no we can't use this in my
brows I think she did that on much
instead so yeah that is the color that
it's kind of like a warm medium brown I
would say but yeah I'm excited to it
give that go at myself and see how it
goes boo okay so we then I've got a
brush this is one of the brushes it's in
the style 12 I'm guessing all the
brushes like copper numbers and so it's
basically an angled brush I'll just go
out the package it and basically an
angled brush would like a little spooley
on the end I never don't see that huh
just one of those little guys at the end
yeah it's just an angled brush like so
these are really handy for obviously
brows and stuff I use pearl made for my
brows so I always need a good angled
brow brush you can kind of use it the
liners and stuff as well but I feel like
when it's got this
like it just makes a really good brow
part up because I always brush through
my brows as well like they need to be
tamed you know they need to be saved
we've got another blender brush this is
kind of like more of a foundation brush
so it's in the style at number four
being kind of see it back small just
like a flat top foundation brush which I
don't usually use this to apply
foundation but they are handy sometimes
if you want to sort of like put the
foundation on tea face and then use a
different brush to blend oh I also
really love brushes like this for primer
and moisturizers they're just really
easy to work it on say if you don't want
to use your hands for whatever reason so
thank you for that I've got a lot to
prove
smooth silk eyepencil and if just shade
one I'm pretty sure this is just black
yeah oh my gosh always need i'm always
forever on the hunt for a good black
waterproof liner and the other side
actually has a little smudger
as well which is quite key always
somebody to have something like that for
trouble it's still yet to find my
favorite black eyeliner like I feel like
so many people have an eyeliner that
just they swear by and it just like does
the job every single time like I don't
know I just I find issues with all of
them if you know I mean so I'm gonna try
to give this go hopefully it's the one
that I use fall in love with great and
then last but not least I've saved the
biggest product of the last this is the
I love Armani red cup red carpet eyes
and face palette and I believe this is a
Christmas like special how cute
can we just talk about this like I'm
obsessed so it's just a little oh right
palette that has the I love Armani on
the front and then you open it up my
husband used a little bit because this
is actually the one that we used on the
eyes
so on the actual day we basically just
did a mix off the navies as you can see
here so ease the pot like the eye and
brow base as like a much higher say is
like the item for how product is a base
and then we kind of went in with like
navies and stuff like that and did a
little bit the gold as well and like I
said it is a face palette as well so you
actually open it up underneath and
there's a whole different section of the
face so you've got pretty sure those are
two concealers at the bottom and then
powder at the top and I'm sure though
they like to sponges yeah
so that is the face section only thing
that like kind of books me a little bit
about the palette is there's kind of no
really like light transition colors like
I love the shades in here but I just
think to use it by itself would be quite
difficult for like the average person if
you not I mean unless you're just gonna
use it for let you like a smoky lower
lashline or just to do like a bit of
like a smoky upper lash line and the
liner is job I just think for like the
average person it could be like a little
bit difficult to use but either way like
the quality of the product is obviously
that like that really good quality eye
shadows and things like that so kind of
just depends like what your preference
is when it comes to eyeshadows and
things so that is the last thing the
packaging I just don't I can't do it so
yeah like I said it must save it thank
you to Miriam for sending all those
goodies over I adore you you know I do
okay so I'm gonna move on to cult beauty
so the guys that cook you see very
kindly sent over two separate packages
so I think one of them I've heard a lot
don't like the paper like a little sheet
that was inside but I think it's kind of
like a little group of like fave
products and stuff that they picked out
and then the other stuff with some ho WC
Jota pchoo WT I never know saying I'm
gonna start with the Jota bc keep
switching Bob I'm gonna start
with the hood of BT strong though the
first thing is the 3d highlighter
palette which is in its little plastic
container all this job I'm not like
touched or anything like that I've only
really kind of like played with the on
my stuff so all this I'm excited to use
and I was saying on Twitter the other
day I think I'm gonna do like a hood of
beauty attest and Tuesday because I feel
like she's got a good amount of products
I don't know to kind of do that
obviously now the Foundation's out and
things I've just out of there I'm so
excited to use them and so this is what
the palette looks like this is in the
shape age which one is this okay so it
doesn't say which one it is you can
probably sup like I'll find out for you
and link it down below of course but
this is what it looks like inside so
it's got full shades down there and then
it's kind of got like the instructions
or like the ways that are recommended to
use them oh it's pink songs how's it
that looking at it in person now I don't
know why didn't buy it because it's
absolutely stunning
I'll do like a little swatch
do you see that oh my god okay Wow
they Australian so that was the - like
like two shades Santorini and azureus I
think I'm excited to try that as I said
I'm gonna save all this stuff all the
hood of Pete's stuff for a test in
Tuesday then got the liquid map mini so
we've got trendsetter Fleur spice girl
and vixen these are adorable honestly
there's something about mini makeup
products that just really melts my heart
like I just think they're so sweet I'm
not gonna swatch any of those or
anything like that obviously I'm gonna
save all of it for a testing video as
I've said like five times come on how
that they know know yeah they look
adorable I've never actually tried
liquid lipsticks from her to be two
before so if anyone's tried them let me
know any thoughts I don't know why I
just don't know I guess I just never
will super drawn to any particular color
we've got two pairs of lashes again
never tried her lashes and so I'm really
excited about these we've got Jade which
are number 13 which are those ones there
and it kind of just looked like to be
honest they don't really look like my
kind of lash because they liked to
layers
I don't you're not really gonna see in
the box but they've kind of got a layer
of lashes that's like above a layer
underneath if you know what I mean like
they look quite separated if you know I
mean so I'm not gonna judge them
obviously cuz I've not tried them yet
but those are those these remind me so
much of iconic like when I looked at
them it just took me back to when I was
obsessed with ikonics because if
anyone's been following my channel for a
while you'll know House of lashes icon
eggs were just like my go-to my absolute
favorites I swear by them these are the
Sasha rushes and well number and let
them and they just really give me that
vibe I'm pretty sure that both faux mink
as well which is obviously amazing so
I'm excited to give those ago thank you
so much - cool Beauty for sending them
we've got the mini mole obsessions
palette these things like honestly I
don't know why I expected it to be a bit
bigger like I knew they were gonna be
mini palettes but guys again it just
melts my heart like that's so tiny so
this is the more one the move
I says it's got a really nice sight
Samara at the top was just obviously
super handy and then those are the
colors that I'm gonna swatch them but at
the same time I'm like I want to save it
I'm gonna do one okay I can't help
myself
oh yeah you can't really see very well
but that is the kind of like pinky shade
on the top right but ya can't wait to
use that can't wait to give it a go and
then in the second parcel from BCBG bag
called PC know we first I've got a
selection of new sticks I'm pretty sure
this is like a little mini gifts at
someone sane fireworks up outside hello
I've heard really good things about the
brand nude sex but for some reason I've
just never got around to like train any
of this stuff so I'm really excited to
give these a go okay so this is like a
creator's public because I'm basically
looking at the packaging on the front
and it's got different signatures on so
it's got kind of like instructions on
the back as well I'm ways that you can
wear them and things I'm pretty sure
it's just like a selection of news yeah
so it's actually got like a little
insert in the tin it's got a mirror
which is really cool and then it's got
an insert about the different and people
who created the colors I'm guessing are
so yeah that's really cool I'm really
excited to give those a go so they've
got a Shastra in here which is super
handy these I like the product so
they're basically just like stick lip
products kind of just like really chunky
liners which I have to say at the minute
like I'm really just wearing a lip liner
and nothing else I don't know why like
that's all I've gotten today and I just
find it so much easier to maintain if
you're not I mean though I'll swatch one
this is the shade go girl
blue creamy
that's watch really well it's kind of
like a really warm like super warm nude
yeah that's basically just a selection
of nude so I can't wait to get those ago
again if anyone has tried any nude
sticks let me know because I would love
to know what people's thoughts are now
we've got a few products from boxing
because buxom is now on called beauty
which I love because for ages boxing was
pretty much just available in like
Sephora and stuff but yeah another one
called Beauty that available and
hands-on in the UK which I love so the
first thing we've got here is a
lightweight liquid lipstick in the shade
instigator half say I've only ever tried
one thing from boxing before and it was
like one of their lip glosses and it's
kind of like the lip plumping ones so
that is it the package in there I don't
know if it's gonna focus really sleek
and then like I said this is the shade
instigator
so I'll just really not like space whew
okay so it's kind of like a movie purple
color yeah can't wait to try that it's
like a really nice color for autumn fall
what's in fall autumn winter and also
got a mascara the blackest black mascara
love having a good mascara in the
collection so thank you so much just a
minute now we've got a buxom full-on lip
polish that's what they called and this
is in the style Gaby whoo oh my gosh
okay
how interesting does that look in the
actual container so it actually looks
glittery like it looks metallic yeah
it's kind of got like a metallic sheen
to it to be honest instigator and Cappy
would actually go really well together
so that is the shade that this babe oh
you can go see a bit best there the only
thing I don't like about these is the
applicator because it's just like a
really tiny thing and it's just personal
preference but I don't like when
applicators for glosses are like tiny
because I feel like they just I don't
know when they're like really firm as
well it's just like a specific type of
applicator that's not my favorite it's
not like the worst thing in the world
cuz the products still great but you
know is anyone else like that like I
love lip gloss applicators they're just
big and fat and you just like SWAT like
the Rihanna one the Rihanna Fenty beauty
lip gloss has such a cool applicator and
then that last but not least we've got a
full-on lip cream this is in the shade
hot toddy
that's so huge so this is like a similar
packaging but it's got like a matte
finish oh this looks like a bit of a
this
oh yeah that's a bit mate so that is the
shade that just like a plastic kind of
pinky peachy nude
absolutely love that and like I said I
do really like these glasses
I have the shade what shade is it I
don't know but I'll link it underneath
this one and I do really love it don't
thank you - cookie T for sending those
over can't wait to give them a go they
also sent over a cleansing stick ooh
this is interesting I'm not sure you
open this yeah though this is the bottom
out sprouts and frying them so bad this
is the cow like cow lien color I don't
know I'm gonna hold it up here so you
can see but that's the run at the bottom
I'll pop it in the description bar below
apply to dry skin and massage gently to
remove makeup and cleanse the face by
adding tops of water rinse off with
lukewarm water mmm interesting so it's
kind of like a great charcoal stick and
kind of reminds me of a pretty sure
Rachel I've seen Rach in the past you
use a stick by its heart that's like
it's almost like a face mask and a stick
and it's kind of like a charcoal stick
yeah by the looks of it it kind of
reminds me of that so I'm excited to
give it a go because I love stick
products stick foundation stick bronzes
stick highlights it is like just sticks
in general I just think that's so easy
and like fun to use and just like apply
on the skin and then last but not least
when I saw this product in the Box I
thought this was so interested in so
this is a high-performing daily beauty
trio the ultimate smile care regime by a
brand called upper a PA
oh I'm not opening it yeah but it says
it contains one lip loofah huh and one
blue lip shine and one tooth glass so
it's basically a little care to help you
basically all the products together give
you like a brighter smile and just I
don't know I think that's kind of like
the aim there basically has a lip scroll
which I have to say I've been using a
lot of lip scrubs recently and the
packaging is super cute by the way it's
a just white packaging and it's just got
the gold upper or a PA and I think this
is just like a yeah so this is basically
a lip scrub as you can see which like I
said I've been loving lip scrubs
recently now that we're getting it's
like winter time I dropped it now that
we're getting to inside my lips get so
dry like beyond dry so I love a good lip
scrub the instructions for this
just to say massage it and unlike prints
with water and stuff and then next on
the directions is the blue lip shine so
it basically says - as you can see it's
literally I don't know if you're gonna
be able to tell you can see like in the
tip it is literally like a blue lip
product so I'm guessing it's kind of
like a gloss um and I think the idea is
like the tint of blue on the lips is to
make your teeth appear whiter then it
also has a tooth loss as well which you
apply directly to the teeth so in
general I'm just saying this is such an
intriguing idea and I'm gonna give it a
go and see what it's like like they care
altogether and let you know my thoughts
and stuff well I've never seen like a
little kit like this so now the last
thing in it the parcel was this so the
packaging is adorable it's all pink and
this is the brilliant skin it detoxify
and brights in a purifying pink clay
mask love a good mask I just love them
especially in like the bath and things
and so when you open it actually has a
little applicator which I named is so
cute because clay masks especially a
really messy especially if you like me
and you sometimes have acrylics I like
you just get all sticky nails which is
like it's such a personal problem I know
every but I just love that it comes with
a little brush I think that's super cute
they basically says it detoxes
invigorates refines and brightens so
it's basically just a baby pink kind of
like clay mask I love I mean I've said
it like five times but I love I could
clay masks
L'Oreal do really good ones as well and
the actual container this feels really
nice it feels really like heavy and
expensive you know if you know what I
mean yeah excited to it give that a go I
will definitely be trying it in the bath
and stuff because bath time for me is
the master time at home especially for
clay must because they are a little bit
messy right stuff so I love doing them
in the bath when I can just like prints
them off and things huge thank you to a
cult beauty for all those goodies that
cannot wait to try them thank you so
much and then this was very kindly

pretty sure this is like the eye shadow

without intensely hydrating foundation
with a wash of cover color but the wash
of color coverage is as white I can't
breathe I don't know what it is but I
see for bridge is as weightless and
refreshing as a splash of water leaving
skin with a natural glow by small
amounts the face with fingertips start
learning from the center of the face
outwards reply application until desired
coverage is quiet I am really excited to
try this because I feel like I don't
really have at the minute a natural
foundation and that I love and by the
sounds of it this definitely is more
kind of like a cross between like a
moisturizer and a foundation so I'm
really excited to give this a go and
I've got the shade medium and light so
I'll probably save that for a first
impression
I am so excited about so these are two
of the liquid gelato pillow top
illuminates is so we quote the shade
ballerina and it guilted honey I'm just
gonna get gilded honey out for now
because I feel like everyone well most
people's like favorite shade of
highlighter like powder highlighter from
Laura Gala is gilded honey though from
what I understand these are just a
liquid version so it just says to
lightly press tube to dispense a small
amount and gently apply to the face and
blend it with fingertips it's got a
really interesting little applicator at
the end it's like this little foam ball
so try coming through you guys so you
can kind of see like that that's a
really awkward place to swatch it kind
of just makes the skin look Wow
and it feels wet as well like it feels
really like just soft and moisturize in
so oh I'm excited to get that go I don't
know if you can see very well um but I
feel like this is a salt product that
would look really nice when you're just
going for like a glowy natural look like
just foundation a bit concealer and
brows and stuff and you just want to add
glow in a natural way without how it is
and then like I said there is a bunch of
stuff from Kiko as well so these are
actually all a face masks but we've got
a mixed Meowth obviously I can't open
them because they are sheet masks we've
got a you are golden eye cooling effect
hydrogel mask which I've never really
found like a good eye mask which I'm
excited to try this because hopefully it
will be nice and see you there like my
under eyes got quite dry recently so I
definitely need something to help out
this as well I think is so interesting
this is a hand mask and it's basically
like disposable gloves and so it's
called fairy hands
it's a hydrate in and see their masks
for hands and nails and I just think
that's so interesting it has like the
instructions on the back as well how
long to leave it on but you literally
put it on as little gloves like I just
think that's so cute so again really
excited to try that and we've just got
you bit of we're just got a few sorry
face masks so there's a zoom anyone I'm
pretty sure these are all the animal
ones we've got a cap which I'm really
excited to try we've also got a panda so
this is kind of like a range within like
the face mask I believe that we've also
got a primer the was that I've just
picked up on camera cuz I swear to God
much I just myself use me okay
moving on need to like nothing about
that I'm a short person if anything ever
happens like spooky like I just ignore
it and move on cuz otherwise I'll just
freak out I'll think about it
