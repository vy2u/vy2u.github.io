video that I've been so excited about
for so long now I've basically been
planning this since maybe like the end
of November like start of December so I
was telling everyone on Twitter and
Instagram I had a really cool idea for a
video and in the sense that I would do a
whole a sort of Christmas whole but it
would be me buying stuff for you guys
rather than the usual like buying stuff
for myself I know you guys love holes
that like the most popular videos I'm on
my channel so when it's sort of switch
it up a bit and just basically save a
chunk of money and put it aside and then
use it for a video where I would hold
stuff for you like I said I did announce
this on Twitter and Instagram so if you
missed out because you don't follow me
on those then make sure you go and
follow me because I always share like
the best like the coolest news on her
and I will do a couple more of these in
future I'm hoping maybe like one or two
next year and so if you do want to be a
part of it then feel free to go and
follow me on those social medias because
that you don't miss out yeah I honestly
do feel just like so so lucky to be able
to like have this as like the main part
of my life and just had so much support
from all of you like it honestly means
the world to me like me and you guys
because you guys just having you then
having like this whole community that we
have like I love it so much so this is
just like a big thank you I guess from
me to you I hope no one's like
disappointed and if they didn't get
picked for me to like shop for I really
wanted to include as many people as I
possibly could which is why I sort of
like saved a good chunk of money to
spend on this and but yeah like I said
everyone's gonna get a handwritten card
sent back it might take me a couple of
days because there are quite a few to
get through and but I'm gonna make sure
everyone gets at least stomp their so
this isn't the first letter right here
this is from a girl called Molly and she
wrote a really sweet little sort of like
two page letter and like so basically
saying that she really loves my videos
and she looks like a lot of the products
I used and she says that she uses the
Nivea men post shave balm and also some
of the Mac brushes that I use and then
she also went on to say that she did see
me when I used to work at Mac once but
she didn't come over and I wish she had
but yeah she wrote a really really sweet
letter and then when it got to at the
wishlist part she was saying how she
wanted to try it the hangover x primer
by Too Faced because she was on the hunt
for a really good primer I'm pretty sure
she said that she's got like textured
skin at the minute yeah skins getting
more textured and their paws are more
visible and juice me using the Nivea
primer but I haven't found a primer
so honey I got you the two-faced one
like I said this is a two-faced hungover
axe I love this this and then every one
of my favorites I do know that some
people have like issues with interview
one sort of breaking them out and
causing my touch on the skin luckily
touch more luckily I don't have that
issue i but this is like my go-to
otherwise so good choice I really hope
you like yeah um and that is the best
one I love this is this so exciting I'm
sort of estimate I love buying for other
people like as much as I love buying
stuff myself
I just love shopping for all this you
know you know okay this next letter
again it's just like a little and this
is like a mini letter and it's also got
the Eiffel Tower on the bottom I don't
really think you guys are gonna know
that see these things and I don't know
hold it up in case if anything in LA so
that people don't want to other people
to see but this letter was from a girl
called Amy and I know Amy because she
has been like one of my longest
subscribers like the longest amount of
time and don't actually know when she
started watching my videos and in fact
it says here I started watching you it's
twenty thousand subs yeah so like right
back in the day like we've got a few
years ago when I was just sort of
starting out and I always just used to
like noticed like how much she tweeted
me and how much she's just sort of like
made the effort and interacts with me
and I still do chat so this day I feel
like I feel like friends now you know so
yeah it was really excited on this one
got picked out and I saw her name and
like her Twitter at name because I knew
it was her straight away she basically
put that she wanted something from Mac
because she doesn't own any Mac products
and she didn't mention eye shadows so I
picked out the burgundy x 9 palette
which looks black so yeah I'm sure a
couple of you've seen this palette by
now it's one of their sort of mini and
nine palettes these are really good for
the money they're like 25 pounds to live
they've actually gone down in price they
used to be 30 but this one is my
favorite one just because um I love
Burgundy's as a lot of you know she did
she didn't actually mention it in a
letter as well that she likes sort of
like movie eyeshadows and I feel like
you can have something quite natural
this or something quite dramatic as well
I'll actually show you properly hi yes
there's a good range of marks a good
range of shimmers like darks lights etc
so I feel like for someone who doesn't
own any other products from arc this is
like a really good start because it
gives you a lot to play with so that is
for you Amy and I really hope you like
it okay
so you have a little card which
sub-sites so I love the amount of
Christmas cards that I've got now
because so many pcent like cars and once
this video is done I'm what you're gonna
like put them on my shelves and it's
just gonna be so full and I'm gonna feel
like so festive yeah it's a little a
tragic card that says have a cracking
good Christmas thank you I will is this
from a girl called Lauren who is at 17
and lives in Northern Ireland and Irish
accents are one of my favorites so hey
she basically wrote me a really cute
little card but then also put a letter
in as well basically saying like how
much she loves my videos and and how you
know she just loves sitting down with
like a cup of tea and like watching my
channel and stuff and how she feels like
I'm the sort of big sister that she
never had which I just think is so sweet
because I would love to be sisters with
all of you like that would be so much
fun
and then I stirred a little wishlist she
basically said and that she wanted to
try like some gold powder splash
highlighters and she mentioned that
she's quite fast skin so something that
would be suitable for her skin side so I
picked out a highlighter by Laura Kelly
because Laura got highlighters are so
beautiful
I have gilded honey that's the one that
I use but because she says she's quite
fair and I picked out peach glow I'm
trying to like open it so I can actually
show you what it looks like so that is
peach glow right there it has got like a
more rosy tone compared to things like
um gelded honey but I feel like things
that are sort of peachy tone like fit
quite nicely this past skin and the
reason I pick this one is because I feel
like it could work as a blush Sephora or
as a highlighter um I really want to
swatch it obviously I can't cuz it's not
mine but I just a little formula these
they go on really beautifully on the
skin and they sort of just like melt in
and sit really nicely that is why I
picked for Lauren and I really hope you
like it
and hopefully it's not too dark for you
but then again even if it is um you
could use it as an eyeshadow I got you
okay next up we've got a letter from a
girl called Casey and she's pretty like
little snowflakes and stars all around
the edge of it which I love because red
is my favorite color as well and look
the way she starts that she just
thoughts just let us say that you've
been uploading some bang game content
and my life your new brows yeah she
also mentioned that she loves my
stripped down challenges as well which I
really love because obviously those
videos are so long so anyone that I hike
us the energies to watch them like hot
soft to you here on her wish list she
listed a couple of things again
one of them was the verb at lipstick by
Mac and I loved matte lipsticks which is
why I chose this one like out of
everything that map shows I feel like
their lipsticks and lip liners are like
my favorite things this is in the shade
bird it is a matte and it's just a
really beautiful like deep sorry excuse
my hands and sort of like deep brownish
Brown I honestly got this just because I
feel like it's quite a unique color like
I don't know it's just like such a deep
sort of warm brown and if you like
colors like this again a so beautiful
for autumn and winter and I do really
like the mattes the mark doors because
they last really long and I don't find
them to be too drying on the lips so
that's right thanks for you okay next up
this card this card is like the cutest
thing ever let me actually show you what
it looks like it's got a cut on the
front and it basically looks like
crunchy because it's like a brown tabby
so straight off when I saw this I was
like wow this girl knows me so this is
actually from a girl called
Ellie and she basically said this card
and then there's also a little note
inside it which I absolutely love like I
love seeing everyone's hand right in is
that really weird but like I love seeing
people's handwriting my voice over the
crack then Wow and she also says that
she has a YouTube channel called Ellie
Marie with one point 6 K sob so let's
see if we can get to like maybe I'll try
and find it and put it on the screen
yeah yeah actually just makes me like
you laugh so much though because she's
done like a little spelling mistake in
the card and sort of scribbled out and
then at the bottom it just says it
starts for up the card oops I
just followed the wishlist she basically
said like it was sort of ops me she
listed a couple of things and one of
them was velvet teddy so I thought I
would get it up because I feel like
velvet teddy is just like a staple in
anyone's life we used to sell so many of
these at Marc like it was the most
popular thing on concert obsessed about
this and soft and gentle but again it is
a matte lipstick by Marc I feel like so
many people have like own this or seen
this and it's just like a really nice
sort of warm terracotta like peachy
Brown new I like velvet teddy as well
because I feel like it looks different
on everyone's skin like I never liked it
on myself because I felt like it looked
quite like almost too warm for my
complexion but on other people like I
always used to love it so I feel like
it's a really interesting and like so
because it really does look different on
different people and I thought we Aaron
get I like a nice matte lipstick because
it means the card the card is just me
and crunch okay this next card I love as
well this is like one of those weird
like 3d cards that make your eyes go
funny it's got a little monkey oh my
gosh it's actually making my face when
you're looking at it it's got a look a
little a little monkey on the front and
it says have your selfie a merry little
Christmas which again so me this is from
a girl called Lucy I love the inside of
there she basically sent his card and
then also some little notes here I love
that she does looks like she's included
a letter that has a little list of all
the things that she's sort of learned
from our videos so she spot how to do a
smoky eye how to say positive no matter
wha and then she also mentions that she
really looks like my stripped down
challenge as well she put like she
watched the whole hour which I mean that
his commitment she also asked about my
doing prompt makeup as well and like I
really wish that I did but I don't
and then the second piece of paper is
her little wish list which I don't
really want to show because it's got
like all of my personal details on and
but it's got like a little list and then
they're all highlighted in different
colors which i think was really cute and
but the one that I chose one of the ones
that she put was the mary lou and the
bomb highlighter which you guys know
it's my baby so yeah I feel like I've
shown it so many times on my channel I
don't really use it a lot on camera
anymore and I don't reach for it loads
and I don't know why I think it's
because I know that I love it so I like
to sort of try other things to sort of
find other things that I love as well
rather than just using things I already
know I love but this is like a staple in
anyone's like sort of collection here is
sort of fair to medium skin depending on
how intense you want your highlight high
light I love the packaging of the bomb I
feel like it's really fun really flirty
and like playful and then you open it up
and boom that is a mary lou right there
it comes with a nice little mirror it's
like a really pretty sort of pale
champagne gold highlight and for anyone
that like I said is sort of fair to
medium skin I feel like this makes such
a good gift because it's relatively
affordable it's like seventeen maybe
sixteen pounds and it is just beautiful
at the quality of products by the balm
it's just insane so that right there is
for you Lucy okay so next again is a
little handwritten letter which I love
these like my favorite thing
to read and just put a little different
colored hearts all the way down the site
as well and this is from a girl called
Nicole and I'm not gonna read out like a
lot of what's in this because if you
like you guys sometimes that we really
like personal stuff and stuff that's
happening in your life which I love
reading but obviously John when I like
share it on camera in case you don't
want other people to know but I love
that you think that like you feel like
you can tell me stuff because obviously
you can unlike I always really enjoy
reading things and sort of knowing more
about you and knowing like if I can help
you in any way and which I just think is
really sweet but yeah she was basically
saying about how she had a bit of a hard
time in university but she'd gained more
confidence at going through watching
like my videos and other YouTube videos
and things like that which I just think
is so cool yeah that person in my day so
thank you so much Nicole for like
sharing that with me because I know like
the similar stuff you put in this is
really personal and I'm just really
happy that you felt that you could share
it with me because like oh I just want
to cuddle yeah on her wish list and she
mentioned a couple of things and one of
them was the beautiful that Lily lashes
that I use which are these bad boys
right here that I actually have on my
own eyes as well these are in the style
that Jamie Cobb and as I said they are
Lily lashes and my favorite lashes of
all time I just love them so much
they're so flattering and so wispy like
I'll show you the actual package yeah
they're just beautiful like they're not
too much they're kind of natural I would
say for a false lash that you can tell
that your lashes definitely have like
more volume and it looks up even and
fluttery but they're not sort of like
really intense right it's like you can
tell they're super fade they're really
comfortable as well like I wear these up
to like 30 times depending on how they
wear like sometimes the lashes fall out
which is kind of annoying but they're
just so comfortable they're really easy
to put on and the packaging is beautiful
they've got their own little box so you
can keep them safe and like I said the
actual Russian general is beautiful and
I'm really happy that I could get you a
pair of these because they are pricey
they're about 30 pounds so I know a lot
of people don't like spending the money
on them but I did want to treat you and
get you some goodies though these are my
favorite blushes and they after you
Nicole thank you so much food beautiful
out there
and I really hope you like the lashes
okay and then we've got a card and a
letter here so this card is from a girl
called Sadie and it's a really cute like
white card and it says
Nowell on it so you basically did some
little scribbles inside and stuff and
try like to make sure I don't show
people's personal info yeah basically
saying that she looks at my videos and
then she put a little list of some of
the stuff here and one of the items
actually asked what was the same as
Charlotte who wrote this letter here and
again I love this because she basically
like printed out each and everything
which i think is really cute like to
take the time to do that and well they
both asked for a Beautyblender as one of
the things that they wanted so I picked
up two of them right here from Court
Beauty and I chose this off they're less
just because you guys know I love a good
beauty burger I never used to like them
but recently I really love them like on
dry concealer and sort of um setting
powders and loose powders and things
like that like bacon they just make
stuff sort of blend and like sink into
the skin it's so much better so I wanted
Street guys to a Beautyblender
each and just because I know they're
like pricey first ones when people don't
really like spending the money on them
but they're definitely worth it and I
know you will love them as much as I do
so those are those two okay so if the
angles just change over stuff like
restart so this next one is a less again
this I loved reading so much this is
from a girl called Amelia and again I do
kind of know Amelia because we met a VFS
and it was so much fun she basically
said like this huge like three page
letter like an absolute essay which I
have to say that my favorite wants to
read because I feel like you just go
into so much detail and end up rambling
and that's just basically me and there's
also this really cute like card as well
and it's basically they've got like a
bunch of pictures and it says ten
reasons to smile today if you're feeling
down and ten reasons why I love you and
that is tight the cutest thing ever
because it definitely made me smile and
I feel like I'm just going to keep this
near me for when I'm having to shoot
there honestly like some other effort
that you guys go to and you're like
writing stuff it actually just blows my
mind because things like this and not a
five minute job like I know how long it
takes to write like a four page letter
and then do something like this as well
so thank you so much to Amelia and for
taking the time to do that and then I
love this as well she also caught the
exact date when she wrote this was the
22nd of November and I had exactly two
hundred and ninety nine thousand two
hundred and thirty seven subscribers and
it was at 6:30 a.m. which is very early
you are very early that energy goes on
say about how we met
and I do remember because she asked me
to follow her on we like took a picture
and stuff and she asked me to follow her
on Instagram for me and Rach like had no
signal throughout the whole day what
struck me fast I don't know what it was
I don't if it was just my phone and but
I basically put her in scrum in my notes
and admittedly I did forget to then go
back on it so I'll find you in a minute
but yeah thank you so much for this
letter honestly like it made my day like
I loved reading it so much and then
she's put a little wish list at the end
and one of the things on it was the Too
Faced Born This Way concealer for like
highlighting and whatnot so I basically
picked up this which fun you can see is
the concealer this is in the shade fair
so it's not good very lightest it's like
the one up and just because I feel like
very far is quite pinky and I've kind of
preferred the shade myself for
highlighting so yeah this is the shade
fair as I said it just looks like so
this is one of my favorite concealers
ever the only thing for me is it can be
kind of drying so for Amelia or anyone
else watching this who also wants to try
it I would just say if you're gonna set
it make sure you use like a damp Beauty
Blender I have to use a damp Beauty
Blender rather than a brush just set
this apart adjust so that it sinks in
and so it's a lot nicer and but yeah I
love this concealer so I'm really wanted
to get it for you and I really hope you
like here thank you so much for the cart
like they're lovely laughter sorry and I
hope I can see you again soon and I
won't find you on Instagram I promise
okay so this next one is from a girl
called Tasha I'm not gonna like show you
the latter because it's got basically
like all the personal details on the
front but she just wrote a really sweet
letter and again I remember this being
and one of the first ones that I read
when I was like watching that film with
my dad and when she basically said how
she feels really inspired when she
watches my videos which is super cool
and I did also meet her in mark when I
used to work there which again so cool I
used to love meeting you guys in there
one of the things that she popped on her
list she had some stuff from Real
Techniques some stuff from morphe and a
Mac Velvets heavy lipstick but also
hoola bronzer by benefit which I wanted
to get this it was near the top so I
guess that um wanted one like wanted
this the most
hoola bronzer is one of my favorite and
bronzers ever it's a really lovely sort
of like the car key neutral to call base
I would say like there's not a lot of
warmth in it so it works really well as
a bronzer shape also as a contour shade
as well and it comes with a little
mirror and a little brush which are in
there
the powder itself is absolutely lovely
like it blends really lovely so I really
hope you like this and I feel like it's
really good for different skin tones as
well so again it makes a great gift but
yeah thank you stash it so much for your
letter and I hope I can see you again
soon this next one again is like a
little card I love this it's like a
really dinky car that says have a
totally awesome Christmas and then it's
also got a little oil and then it's also
got this mini letter inside and again
this is one of the fares this is from a
girl called Georgina and can I just say
like Georgina if you're watching this
which I hope you are your handwriting is
so pretty but so small like it's amazed
me that she's managed to like write so
small but it still looks so good like
how is it so neat but yeah she wrote
this little note just saying how proud
of me she is which is really sweet thank
you so much and then she also mentioned
that she's got GCSE marks coming up so I
hope they went well if you've already
had them in December or we'll go well
during January because I feel like
different schools do different things
one of the things that she mentioned
having was a foundation by Too Faced
there's a lot to face going on here and
this is a born this way and again I do
really love this and for me like I
remember saying this in a video and a
couple of people sort of disagreed what
I said but I feel like it's quite a
intense foundation so my husband really
pissing me off
not onions hence foundation but I feel
like it's quite a thick I guess it's
very like a sort of like thick moosie
formula like for a liquid foundation I
would say but I absolutely love it I
feel like with a good primer this goes
on like a dream and it's a really good
coverage and she asked for the shade of
pearl which is exactly what I got
because you know you aski gap just looks
like this out of the package and I'm
it's a really glamorous fossil like I
love all packaging for Too Faced like it
feels so luxurious and yeah it says an
undetectable medium-full coverage which
is exactly what I would agree with it's
sort of like a satin finish I would say
it's not a particularly jewy
it's like stuffing to mark its Millie
hey girl I'm filming a Goldy champagne e
coffee
okay I'll see what I can do oh my god
isn't it like laxatives and it makes you
share I know it is it lenses you our
work the White House and
look at the color view converts the
color of me-time drops what
please thank you so this is from a girl
called muddy are you popping ah no it
doesn't zoom you have to sit down anyway
it's got one well it's a little cute
birds on it and then she also and drew
inside a little snowman which I thought
was really sweet because it's got like
the coolest scarf and then it says it
Merry Christmas time and then as you can
see from Charlie's excellent
demonstration right there she also wrote
a rather cute life to make sure it's not
got a dress showing because like um but
yeah I got em really in fact it's not oh
no sir okay you real good
what does she say Vitelli what she says
hey huh I think you're extremely kind
generous for doing this Christmas horse
bollocks
they saved to say that I'm proud of you
subscriber and you subscribe of course
man oh yes I've got a little wish list
at the bottom and one of the things that
she mentioned was the Kat Von D tattoo
liner which is this bad boy right here
and I love this I love Kat Von D plates
in general and they are kind of like not
hard to get in the UK and but they've
only just started stocking them and it
is waterproof as well so I thought you
would need this to keep your wings on
fleek 24/7 okay how cute is this this is
probably like one of my favorite cards
ever right here
what is this made I guess this is a
Moonpie card and it's basically my
little face Elfi and so fair oh no my
hair looks quite like that and but yeah
this is from a whole video actually and
then she's basically edited it so it's
got little elf ears and a little elf
heart and it says Elfie she knows me so
well
yeah this is from a girl called Megan
again basically saying that she loves
watching my videos as a little escape
from her crazy daily life so thank you
so much for laughing that you went to
you I have actually already written that
card because that was one of
as long as I opened as well join us show
what we brought for our we've got this
bad boy we can't get out the party
inside but not cookies back box back at
jaclyn hill shimmering skin perfector

fragile like I smashed two of these so
I'm not even gonna get it out because

and they're completely crumbled and but
it is such a beautiful highlight I do
have it no palette as well so I can

obviously the highlighter itself is
beautiful and I really hope you like it

Ellen hey oh okay so next is a letter
from a girl called Katie or Katie Jade I
don't know if you prefer to be called
Katie okay to Jade for again home she is
a person that I see tweeting me all the
time and stuff so thank you so much for
like all of you support because it
honestly means the world to me and she
wrote a really sweet letter basically
just saying like that she looks my
videos again and that they really helped
her with things like anxiety and just
like confidence which I absolutely love
because I've been there and I know how
much you've helped me so I love knowing
that my videos can help other people in
a similar way but yeah again it was just
a really sweet letter so thank you so
much and on the wish list one of the
things that she thought was an Anastacio
dipbrow which is right here this is in
the shade caramel and you guys know that
I love the dipbrow from Anastasi it's my
favorite brow product that she does and
it's waterproof so it lasts I'm pretty
sure it's waterproof
yes waterproof so it lasts really long
on the brows it glides really easily and
you got a lot with it like these cost
about 15 pounds which I guess some
people can think it's probably for a
brow product but my last me like up to a
year sometimes so I absolutely love this
and I hope you love it too okay so next
we have it to a cute little Christmas
cards one of them is a litigant a litter
alert one of them's a little gingerbread
man that says Happy Christmas and then
also a snow one that says at Christmas
time these are so cute I'm absolutely
obsessed and they're from a girl called
Sophie and yeah she basically included
them as like one little letter card that
she recently just wrote in these little
cars how much again she supports me and
how much she loves my channel she
actually said she's been watching from
20,000 oh no 30,000 sorry which is
incredible like thank you so much for
sticking around so long and again she
put a little list in that and the top of
her list was a palette by urban decay
this is the moondust palette and I don't
even own this myself
like when I boy I was still sense to
just keep it well I can't do that this
is such a cool palette it's basically
like a bunch of like metallic moon dust
shadows if you like I haven't oh my god
honestly I've not even like played with
this install so I feel like I really
just wanna play with it now but
obviously I won't because it's not for
me and it's got beautiful packaging as
always as all urban decay products do
and then you open it up and there are
eight beautiful metallic shadows right
there honestly it's bacter and galaxy oh
and light yeah oh my gosh you know what
I might just have to buy this myself as
well I once watched them but obviously I
don't really want to go digging my own
fingers into something that I'm gonna
give to Sophie so this is what it looks
like it's just got a really nice range
of colors and like I said they're all
very vibrant sort of intense pigmented
metallics um I just feel like this is
such a cool palette to have like you can
literally use any of these on the lid
and then say if you had the Naked 1
palette by urban decay if you have those
three light you could create so many
looks with this it would be incredible
so I thought I'd got you that because I
knew it was what you wanted most and
which is what you said in your letter
and of course I wanted to treat you so
thank you so much for you little cards
I'm gonna pop them up with the rest and
I really hope you enjoy this palette
tell me some photos so that I can see
what looks you do with it because I'd
love to know this next letter is from a
girl called Erin who is 13 and lives in
Scotland so hi Erin thank you so much
for your letter and this hand right in
his eyes from the cutest handwriting
I've ever seen like a little bit so much
and she wrote in like a really
sort of purpley like pinkish I think
he's a pencil that she wrote in and I
absolutely love it thank you so much
just basically saying how one of the
first videos that she found of mine was
a makeup tutorial and because she was
searching for that on YouTube and ever
since she's just like really enjoyed
channel so thank you so so much like
honestly I feel like I keep saying this
but it just means the world to me that
you guys like I've stuck around with me
for so long and he's felt like with me
now like it just it means everything to
me one of the things that she mentioned
that she would love is the rocket or
rocket or officer Robert or blusher by
benefit and I wanted to get this because
it's my favorite blush that benefit does
it's just like a really beautiful I'm
peachy
sort of like corally pink shimmery blush
I would say I'm obviously not gonna get
it out but that is what it looks like in
the packaging and it's just got a really
beautiful like Sheen to it which I love
in a blusher like I'm I don't really use
matte blushes a lot I feel like I'm sort
of shimmery sort of well it's like the
word I'm looking for like blush it's
with like a bit of machine I feel like
it just look really beautiful on the
skin especially young skin as well that
quite youthful skin and obviously Erin's
13 so I thought this would be perfect
for her um and yeah I really hope you
like it as I said it's one of my
favorites so I hope it becomes one of
your face as well again I remember
reading this really early on if you like
I said left so many letters now and but
this is from a girl called Laura again
it's really cute little letter it's
basically like a similar one with like
the sort of images printed out which I
love I feel like that's just so cute and
the way she's caught them as well like
she's fully fully caught it around like
the mac mineralize in the palettes and
stuff I'm like a trainer so that's a lot
of effort I'm impressed like I used to
be like putting stuff up like this
is in this time but she says merry
Christmas to you in the hatfields I hope
you have a truly special time together
thank you so much like obviously we love
spending Christmas together me and my
phone so I hope you and your phone have
a far Christmas as well one of the
things that she mentioned was a Mac
bronzer in whichever shade you recommend
for pale skin and rosy cheek so I picked
out a Mac mineralize because this is my
favorite product and that muck doors to
use as a bronzer I don't really like
rate the bronzes that much I much prefer
the Malloys powders in like the shade
that like sort of fits you for like a
bronzer just because like the powder
itself it just blends I could dream it
looks like natural skin I feel like I've
said this so many times about this hard
of what it just looks so beautiful and
natural on the skin like it looks like
it's part of you you scared any face in
your complexion if that makes sense so I
chose the shade and medium dark just
because I have medium dark and dark and
medium dark is the one that I can sort
use and when I've got a little bit of
tunnel but also when I'm kind of fair as
well so this is what it looks like it's
just a really beautiful yeah mineral
powder and again it comes with a little
mirror which is super hot super super
handy super handy here you definitely do
feel like it works quite well for sort
of slightly fairer skin just because I
know that I can use it when I've got
like no fake Tanner and I'm literally
like snow white when I've got notes I
don't I'm so pale and just because you
can really build it up they keep going
with a really light layer and it can
just be super natural and just like a
little bit warmth or you can really
build it up if you've got its head on so
I hope you love it let me know your
thoughts because I would love to know
and I hope it works for you as well as
it works for me okay next we have a
little car this is from a girl called
Megan who is 15 and from Stockport which
is that's really cool because obviously
that's not far from me because I live in
Manchester and it's just a really cute
little car that's got a black and white
sort of pattern stripes and then it's
got the web believe in like gold glitter
and there's gold polka dots on it as
well so thank you so much because I do
absolutely love this card she's
basically saying how and she loves sort
of like my towel and stuff and it's
inspired her to once you make up in
future as well like when she's a little
bit older which I mean I think is so
cool she says she's been watching my
channel since mine and Charlie's first
ever collab video which was the stuff
your mouth challenge I believe it was
like back in I want to say April 2015 or
something crazy like that so that's a
really long time thank you so much for
sticking with me and this long and then
in terms of the wishlist she put on that
she would love any Sigma brushes so she
can get better at I makeup so I got you
so for Megan I picked up the Sigma e-40
and which is basically an all-over
fluffy
blend these two actually this is them
the e25 of Olivia these two and like the
two eye brushes I first ever use so
these are like hold a really special
place in my heart because they were my
first brushes when I was getting in
snake for like fifteen sixteen and I
feel like they do do a really good job
doodoo oh my god I'm wit five that's
what ha I actually still have mine to
this day just because I want to keep
them for like a sentimental reason
because they were the first brushes I
ever bought I have bought a small pack
of brushes from Sigma and I still have
pretty much all of them I might have
like bend one or two if they've got
really bad and what in particular these
to the e4c which is just an all-over
blend and then the e25 which is there a
tape of lens
I still have mine even though they're
really struggling and they've basically
got no brochures left just because I
love so just like having them and
knowing like where I started with makeup
and where I am now I can just think it's
like really sentimental I guess and so I
wanted to start you out with the two
bushes that I started out with as well
because I really do believe in these
specialties and I believe in segments as
a brand I think they're great and I
really hope you like them let me like
send me some photos that can see the
soul I look she do but yeah just
practice practice practice and you'll
get that you'll get to where you want to
be I have every face okay so this card
isn't so cute it's like a little penguin
on the front and it says happy Christmas
and then when you open it inside this is
from a girl called Ruby she went to
major effort and he's be careful because
her dresses Hummer and she went to so
much effort with this card I'll just
sort of pop it down and she's also put a
little photo in of herself and honestly
you are really beautiful you're
absolutely stunning so for her wish list
she popped on some black teams which I
actually have a pair of these and
absolutely love them and then she also
put the Too Faced chocolate bar cannot
speak so that is exactly what I picked
up for you this is the Too Faced
chocolate bar as I just said I do have
this myself and I absolutely love it I
love the shades in here it's got like a
really nice sort of mix of like neutral
warm sort of like nuts shimmers and then
it's also got a couple of really pretty
and burgundy shades as well which I love
this one down here cherry cordial is my
favorite and they've got a beautiful
highlight shade which is champagne
chuckle and then a really good range of
like cruise colors as well and every
time we have one of these I immediately
just love the smell so thank you so much
to Ruby for like the coolest card ever
because I can tell like how much after
you went in like you went wow I can tell
how much ever you put in to make this
one really really special and really
cool and so yeah that is for you and I
really hope you love it as much as I did
you know like I will not even like
halfway through these letters and I feel
like this videos got so long actually
needs to go out as well oh I really
need to go out okay so I think what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna like end this
video here just because I still have
like so many items that I've not like
even mentioned and so many cars that I'm
not mentioned because I really did buy
for like quite a lot of people and so I
do I hope you don't mind but I'm gonna
end this video here because I know I've
been

that this video she's gonna be so
ridiculously long so thank you so much
to everyone who did send lessons and if
you're not in this video don't worry
because I'm gonna do my best to like
send something it to everyone like

bunch of stuff in this like trunk here
