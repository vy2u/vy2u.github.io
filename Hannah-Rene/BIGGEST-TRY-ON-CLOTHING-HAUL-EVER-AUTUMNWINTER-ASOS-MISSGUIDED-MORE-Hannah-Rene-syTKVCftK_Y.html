clothing haul because what is new I know
I've got problems I know I keep spending
money on clothes I don't really know
where all this stuff is gonna live
honestly going to partially blame you
guys though because let's be honest you
all love watching clothing holes it
encourages me to buy more clothes so
whose fault is this really I'm gonna
start with a sauce just because that is
what is closest to me so I want to show
you these face which I've actually
already unboxed and everything else is
all in its packaging and stuff but these
I got out yesterday it's a pair of boob
though these are by a brand called
truffle collection which is on a sauce
and I got them because I'm pretty sure
the right 30% off at the minute
everything will be like down below like
all the other pieces of clothing and all
the shoes and stuff they'll be don't
dive oh my mother will help you direct
links to everything in the description
bar below as that always is I always
link stuff you guys because I know you
like to have a nosey for yourself so I'm
pretty sure these had like some discount
on them that they are over the knee
boots because now that we're coming into
you autumn winter time I am loving over
the knee boots I feel like they just
make an outfit look so good it's like
you could go out in leggings and like a
jumper awesome in all leggings and are
really basic like top in the
minute you put over the knee boots on
you just look so glam and it's great so
I want to get the use because I don't
have any lace-up ones and they've got a
peep toe as well and like a stiletto
heel all my other ones they've got like
a chunky yarn they're quite casual so
when it's something lights out and
they've got the reason I like like them
is because they've got a little bit of a
platform
I cannot stand heels I am awful in heels
anyway I hate wearing them a song called
ball but I cannot stand heels that have
no platform whatsoever because my feet
just die I always get a size up in older
knee boots unless the wide fair I have a
quite wide feet so I'm usually a size 4
buy or get size 5 in over the knee boots
just because they seem to be for slim of
here I find so I always just go size up
because they usually fit a lot better so
these are 5 and yeah they're just laced
all the way up they are a bit of a
mission to get on I'm not gonna lie
they've got a zip here which is quite
handy and but they are a bit of a
mission if you like me and you're a bit
curvier and you've got like not super
skinny legs don't feel like can't get
these on at first I had to undo them
loads because I was like oh my god these
are made
I could not get them on and but you just
need to like loosen them and strop and
then they do actually look really
flattering at once it on
I don't tie them all the way up to the
top because the laces don't reach but
they look quite nice just like tied and
like 3/4 of the way up I guess because
at least like that's the upper part a
bit flat it's like I don't know if you
I'm trying all this on anyway so you
will see what they look like then but
yeah as I said these have got this kinda
has a minute so if you like me and you
look over the knee boots don't cut
yourself
okay so it's quite funny because nearly
all of this doctor I've got from a sauce
is men's like oh basically if you guys
watched my parasol I did a whole not so
long ago was actually the last one of
the thing and I got a load of stuff when
I went to Paris and they had a shop
there called 6 June and never heard of
it before and I went in and it was
really cool they had like really sort of
edgy clothes there was a lot of like
distressed or from rips off and
basically a soft stock it and I was like
revelation they do only have the men's
stuff on there but I I loved the men's
stuff like that pink hoodie that I wore
in my lyric prank video I have so many
questions on the video asking where it's
from it's linked in the description bar
that is a men's hottie from 6 Tunes so I
basically saw that they stuck to it on a
sauce and I just picked up like loads
more stuff what the hell is this oh my
god this is so big what sizes again
basically my pink hoodie is a medium so
yeah I got a medium and everything else
because I do like it quite sub-tree and
big and this is sort of like a cocky
camel color and it's a similar style to
the other jumper I have so it's like a
hoodie but it's got like and I don't
know what this neck is called it's like
a pole net it's like where it ruffles
loads it's not a turtleneck it's got
like way more layers it's going to be
really hard to show an off camera but
I'll try it on and then yeah it's got
drawstrings at the bottom as well and
then it just has the little logo
embroidered on it so really nice color
I felt like it'd just be nice again to
like powered leggings and over the new
boots or something just for like
something kind of casual yes yeah my
paint coin in this I live in so as soon
as I saw that they had other hoodies on
a sauce I was like sold and I got one
that was black because you guys know I
live in blah so this one isn't a hoodie
it's just like a sweater it's like a top
sweater situation again it's quite
distressed so it's got like rips
on the sleeves it's short-sleeved and
then it's got rips all over the body as
well which you're not really gonna be
able to see until I try it on and but as
I said my other hoodies de-stress and I
just love the way it looks so I wanted
to get some other stuff that was this
dress and this again just goes of like
really nicely with leggings and jeans
with something kind of casual and day to
day actually got this one in a small and
it was 35 pounds and again it will be
linked down below next one is actually
the same top I don't realize I bought
this like the same top in two different
colors so it seems that same we just
like the same rips and stuff and you can
see the tears a little bit better now
because it's not like to color and it's
just more like a baby nude so yeah I've
got quite a lot of new plugins and stuff
that I'm really loving at the minute so
I wanted some sort of like to call the
tops to go with those as well again I
got this one did I get this in a small
so actually got this one in a medium no
budget bi again it's nice and slouchy
the stuff from here is such low quality
it's like so comfy honestly can't
recommend it enough but I say like who
even cares that it's men's if it looks
good it looks freaking good and then if
you last one this is by a sauce own
brand and this was in the women's
sections it's just a white hoodie
because I don't have any hoodies that
are like I don't know why really love in
hoodies at the minute since I bought
that pink one and but I don't have any
that I like a lighter color so again
just to go with like nude leggings and
stuff it's lecture just a basic hoodie
and it's like a sort of off-white color
so yeah I'm gonna try and keep that
clean probably get makeup all over okay
and then this next thing I wasn't like
sure on but I've been wanting to get one
of these for really long I basically
wanted like a cropped camo jacket to go
with like all black outfits because I've
just been seeing these ever at the
minute and they always look so good on
people with like an all-black outfit and
like white trainers or over the new
boobs or something like that so I found
one on a sauce it's actually bad new
hair it's actually just a cropped come a
jacket so it's like a sort of denim
material and then it's just got like
longer sleeves and two little pockets at
the top I'm gonna try this on and see
how it looks because I feel like you
either really pull this off or you
really don't and usually
really no but yeah just like all black
outfits to add a bit of color to it
because as I said I'd you were a lot of
all-black and it does get kind of boring
so just something to mix it up you know
you know okay and then this next thing
I've actually worn a couple of times so
I've just got out of my wardrobe but I
wanted to show you anyway because I did
buy it like similar time of all this job
and I love it it's one of my favorite
pieces of like clothing at the net a
black denim jacket it's like a sort of
ribbed and denim material it's a really
nice material and then it's got a black
fur collar and I love this honestly just
so girly like leggings and a bodysuit or
like jeans and a bodysuit it looks so
good and I've wanted a Jenner jacket for
so long but I don't like getting them in
sunder denim colors because I feel like
they're kind of hard to style she can't
wear them with like normal called jeans
cuz it's like double denim I really kind
of you worked in not saying you can't
but they doesn't suit me yeah I saw this
on a sauce it's got pockets like here
it's got a zip going up the center and
honestly it just looks so good we like
every outfit I put it with I got it in a
10 and I can't know how much it was but
it got really down below and unless we
think this like one of my favorite
things but awesome winter now because
it's so cozy but it just looks so good
at the same time I really recommend it
and then the last thing I got was
actually from River Island because
obviously a sauce trucks for the runs
and and it's just one of these jumpsuits
that's like what's the name of the
pallets weather like just straight but
loose yeah these are really inside the
minute I'm seeing them like everywhere
and I really wanted a black on black
gonna find one so finally found one on a
sauce and I like that it's got
adjustable straps to the back because I
always like to adjust how low down it
comes on the chest
it has a v-neck and it's like a really
nice ribbed like thick ribbed material
and I just thought that'd be really nice
like winter time to layer with like a
big coke and some trainers or something
like that just they're going for like a
really casual outfit okay awesome
miscarriages and there is a lot of stuff
from misguided you guys know I love
misguided as it is but I think it was
last week maybe they had 50% off the
whole site and I was just like Oh
honestly I've never known an online
store to do like such a big discount on
the whole site so I bought like triple
the stuff to what I usually will buy so
honestly
prepare yourself like I actually can't
deal this is just the first bag this is
one of three so first thing I got
another one of those jumpsuits that is a
similar style to the river island one
it's um always actually got tired straps
I didn't realize so it's a light gray
color there was only a couple of these
left on website there was three
different colors I think and but this
was the only one they had left in stock
in my size again it's like a ripped
material and it just goes inside the
long wide it trousers and I'm just
seeing this everywhere like I said and
they look so good on people and they
look so comfy which is all I actually
care about I also just love being comfy
and I love wearing things that is so
easy to put on but you can style them to
make them look good and I feel like this
is one of those like sorts of items so I
got this in a size 8 today yeah I got
this in an 8 because they're usually
quite stretchy and and yeah again just
to like layer with coats and trainers or
like little short boots or something I
just think for wintertime like they're
really lovely and such is that one what
is this alright bad when you don't even
know you for okay and next I just got em
and MIDI square because I don't really
have a lot of miniskirts but I really
like them for autumn/winter again
because they cover you a little bit more
and to keep you a little bit warmer when
it's cold outside because we live in the
UK and obviously it gets freezing so
this one's actually quite thick I'm
pretty sure it was quite affordable and
but it's really nice and thick I always
get worried with skirts like this that
they're going to be see-through when
they're like a jersey material but I can
feel that this is double layered so it's
got two layers of like jersey material
and so it's not going to be see-through
which is nice so yeah it's literally
just a MIDI bunny con skirt kind of like
sits high on your waist and the waist
bands a bit thicker got this in an a and
again just to like pop with them say
like a white body sue and a pair of
heels and then like a long waterfall or
like trench coat just something nice and
classy you know a class t-bird hey why
did I just say that okay and then they
actually had because obviously what
companies often like that as I said
about five freaking times it had so much
knitwear and I am a sucker when it gets
to like the end of the air and all the
knitwear starts coming in I just want
all of it so first thing I got was a
massive
black jumper because I don't actually
have any black like knitwear and
obviously because I wear black leggings
and watchings a lot I feel like it's
just essential really so I got this in a
sad always actually a dress okay
so I can off the shoulder dress so it's
like Bardot cot and or like a really
white neck if you want it to be and then
it's got like long sleeves and it goes
down yeah into a dress so I remember
seeing this now I'm thinking like a bet
with all the knee boot parrots with over
their knee boots so this again is a
jumper dress but it's like the same
color is the top that I have for
misguided that I get so many questions
on just like a really nice baby pink
color and and yeah again it's just a
jump a dress so it just goes into a long
dress Wow nice and on it's got like a
little bit of a split hem at the sides
that and then it's just got coughed up
sleeves
it looks so comfy I saw it on the model
and I was like man got that in a 10
because I always like jumper dresses and
like a general t-shirt dresses so you
really loose and really oversized
because I'm on the taller side as well
I'm 5 foot like seven and I feel like it
was just cater wow I really slept my
selves in I feel like they always cater
to people who are like 5'4 and that's
just not me and it's always too short on
me so I like to go up a size okay and
then these two things that I'm really
excited about what I had my eye on for
quite a while and then when the 50%
discount came on I was like right okay
I'm gonna get them now because I'll be
like so much more affordable oh I loved
when it when Carli bybel did here
collection we misguided and loved the
long trench coats that were like Cher
I've got a gray one and it looks amazing
with so many different outfits and
there's basically a black one in a nude
one that's not part of her collection
that's just misguided and I've wanted
them for so long so I finally got them
it's just literally a block judge go
it's kind of like a silky material it's
a little bit like a robe I guess that
you would have liked for when you go to
bed but it's like a really nice coat and
these always just look so classy like
especially to put on to like dress up an
outfit a little bit and again because
it's autumn and winter you just want
like a nice coat but make the still
makes your outfit look good
I feel like trench coats or like duster
coats are just the way to go so it's
kind of hard to show and the ice that
you're just a black duster trench coat
ties up the waist here and yet really
hard to show
you'll see when it's fine I got this in
1/8 I think yeah I got the I got I get
these in an 8 because they fit a little
bit better and I usually don't have a
lot of clothes on underneath because
I'll usually pop them on with like a
dress or like a skirt on the top and but
yeah I love it and just look really
flattering really like classy then I
literally just got the exact same one
but in a nude I think I prefer this one
like look how pretty that looks on the
camera you can kind of see the actual
material better now it's like a really
nice silky material it just feels so
good on your skin it's a little bit
lighter on the inside but yeah they just
look so so pretty it's got this sort of
like belts at the waist again and then
there's parts of it that are like a
different material as you can see there
that aren't like silk I just love the
way they look as I said they look really
classy they're really easy to like dress
up and and then just next like autumn
winter time so that is that one as well
and again I got it in an a and the last
thing in this bag is another jumper tres
because what is new this is like a bit
different because it's got like a
lattice at the front so I love tops and
body suits that have this sort of
lattice detail I feel like it looks
really flattering and this one's like a
bit of a different material it doesn't
feel is nice it's not a soft and it's a
lot more ripped and this one's actually
a body con so it's not a slouchy and
like loose messages the other ones it's
quite short so we'll see how it goes
because as I said I kind have an issue
sometimes when things too short like I
don't like going out and anything that's
too short because I just feel
uncomfortable I can constantly it's on
my mind like am I like revealing my
whole ass cheek so yeah we'll give this
one a go I got it in a small / medium
and it's just black with like gold and
like sort of detailing around the
lattice area and yeah it's just like
every preterius I'm honestly don't know
what China bout anymore but yeah we'll
try it on and I'll see how it goes so
even though it is getting a little bit
colder
I still love wearing t-shirt dresses
especially in the day and on days where
it's like still nice outside I feel like
I'm slipping down this bed on my t-shirt
dresses though it's like summer either
like really light colors so I wanted to
get some darker ones like dark grey ones
and black ones and stuff I could layer
with like bomber jackets and stuff for
winter so this is the first one it's got
like a
and coughed neckline here which is black
then it just goes into a dark gray
t-shirt dress like so it's got a print
on the front that says USA then even
though I'm not American it's got quite a
bright graphic print which is quite nice
I suppose considering the actual dress
is so dark so yeah again just the power
that trainers and boots and stuff for
like casual daytime stuff I love having
pieces that you can listen to throw on
and like walk out the house like that's
my favorite kind of outfit so t-shirt
dresses my fave for that reason and then
what is this okay this is a t-shirt
dress but it was really interesting I
saw it on the model and the way they'd
styled it looked really cool so as you
can see if it's black and it's just got
like a round neck and stuff like a
standard t-shirt dress and but it's got
holes like quite large holes over the
entire like the entire dress the way the
model had actually styled this is that
she had on underneath like a black
bralette and then high-waisted like
black hot pants and it just looks really
cool because I obviously you covered and
stuff but this is kind of just like a
little bit sort of mysterious and sexy
and whatnot and it just looked really
nice just again to go with black heels
or something for a night out I feel like
you could really make this look quite
cool and this is just a another t-shirt
dress this one is actually black because
I don't have any better black what does
it say back to the bow and what does
that say oh my god why can't I read that
oh fast life okay see ya again it's just
a black t-shirt dress with quite a
graphic print on it and I just loved
this one in particular I feel like this
one is so me just again to go with over
the knee boots for they have set up for
every sodding thing I always get these a
couple of sizes up to I usually am sung
usually about an 8/10 so I actually get
t-shirt dresses in a 12 just because I
like them really loose and then I just
got a tall bunny suit because the tall
body suits were misguided it fit me
really well like normal ones don't
because they suffocate my vagina we've
had this conversation so many times yeah
the tall ones are really good this one
is just a choker cut out so it's got a
choker neckline yeah and then a sort of
v-neck here with long sleeves I do have
another body sue in the style but it's
just too short for me so I just needed
to get a new one and I got this in eight
and it's just like a nice soft cotton
again just the way we like jeans and
stuff and this is the sort of thing that
pair we like the black denim jacket with
the fur color from ASOS and they look
really lovely so that is that one
honestly I feel like this guy did just
need to hire me I'd like brand
ambassador because I spend I probably
own at least like 70% on son like this
one I swear to God
okay last is like the happiest well
go it's like never and oh my god I
have problems I actually have problems I
need to get hold it again a nested it
jumper just that is basically my autumn
and winter wardrobe like wow this one's
a different style it's got like a high
round sort of like turtleneck it's quite
tight at the neckline and it's a more
like thicker neck so it's got like a
thicker knitted pattern if that makes
sense
it's got long sleeves again and it's
just a really nice dusty rose pink I
love this color and I've got quite a lot
of stuff in this color really I got a
lot of stuff from Burton that color when
I was in Paris I've just fallen in love
with it like it's such a nice like
flattering color I feel like this one
feels a lot softer than the other ones
this one feels nice there and I feel
like this is my favorite one so far like
you just feel a lot more like luxurious
and soft so yeah that is that I got it
in a size tab and then I treated myself
again I've been wanting this for quite
awhile but it's part of like the premium
range which is usually a bit more
expensive and we're going to pull it
with mark then if you guys know me and
you've seen my other clothing halls you
will know that I love the sort of
bandage dresses from misguided they make
if they make your figure look amazing
I'm sorry so this is one of the sort of
premium like bandage material dresses
that they have it's a white color and
then it's got a gold lattice detail as
you can see here and I saw it on the
model and it just looks so beautiful
that I was just like instantly sold and
the way the reason I love them is
because they always have a nice fit like
they're very curvy here so the way they
make them is up oh my god another to hit
myself in the face well I know it is not
this is marked be kidding me
right I'll show it you anyway but that's
gonna have to go back because it's
really marked the way they make them is
that it always goes a little bit
skinnier on the waist here and then it
sort of comes out at the hips area and
then when you do the zip up at the back
it's just like it hooks you in all the
places you want it to hug and it just
looks really flatter it yeah that's
going to have to go back so I'm going to
put that back in the back straight away
but yeah I do really like it and I got
these in a size 8 and they always fit
perfectly they look really lovely ok I
got the same dress the same one this
marked the white one but in black so
obviously that one's not going to be
marked I won't get it out now and but
I'll try it on so you can see what it
looks like and I just got that one in
1/8 again I forgot I boy in like white
I'm black so I'm kind of glad now
because I do actually preferred of life
is just think that scene with like the
lattice detail and and you'll be able to
see like what I mean about like them
hugging your figure and stuff so yeah
that is that one in black and then I got
one of the pieces from the Sarah
Ashcroft Sarah Ashcroft I don't know why
she would say that so much she's like a
beauty vlogger as well you're so good
it's like a faux suede bodysuit that's
like a lattice detail again and I have
the one from the Carley collection in
this that's like um it's the bodysuit as
well and it's like what's that word like
van Gogh it's like got no idea what and
he just held up and talked him too long
really corny if I go bad no so it's got
no sleeves or no straps it's like I'm a
movi pink and and that one fits me
really well even though it's obviously
like not labeled as tall and so
hopefully this one does is well it's
like elastic and it's like a thong
bodysuit and the other one did fit me
quite well which is where I got this one
and I got it in a 10 so we'll see how it
fits and if it is still in stock then
I'll link it down below but I just love
the colour a bit I really like sort of
like brown like cool brown camel colors
and so yeah that is that and then I got
a pink bike hoodie dress because this
reminded me so much of the one that I
have from 6 June except it was in a
dress and because it's got like the
distressed detail at the bottom again so
it's got like the rips and stuff I'm
just in love with like this sort of
stuff at the minute I feel like I've
bought so much of it that I don't need
but I'm just doing what I love it yeah
it's the same sort of really nice baby
pink color and it's got a hood and then
like drawstrings and whatnot like a
splendid woody I got this in a 10 and I
just love the fact that it's quite
distressed and like it's got like a roll
hem
it's like knots like stitch or anything
at the bottom it's just got like all the
rips and stuff again I just like I said
I love stuff like this I'm crazy I know
I buy way too much great like I don't
even need half of this but it
I've got it now so and then I got a
black sort of sweater and t-shirt dress
I really like the detail on this because
it's got like then lace up sleeves as
you can see here so it's just a plain
sort of black cotton it feels really
soft which is really nice but yeah I
just loved the sort of detail on the
sleeves I feel like it's really really
edgy if you like put your hair in space
buns and then pop some like white
trainers on I feel like that would just
be a really cool outfit and then there's
some pretty shows from the collie
collection it's a sort of attacks like
mash bodysuit and just looks like so
it's just got long sleeves and then a
turtleneck and yeah they like layered
this with a sort of new do pink rubber
and it looked really really lovely I
just love stuff at the minute again
that's sort of like mash and it's like a
little bit see-through weather to a
point where like you still Westmont
under but it just look really cool
because it's layer just it always like a
skirt for a night owl or even just some
trousers or something if you like this
will look really cool so yeah but is
back and list next things like a jumper
and jumpsuit again I've been seeing
these everywhere it's a minute to like
sort of Trekkies jumpsuit thing I don't
know if I love them or I hate them so
I'm going to try it on and you guys in
to tell me do I keep lives or do I get
rage because I don't have any so I got
one to try it on it's like a Bardot cop
so it's it's like off the shoulder and
then it sort of goes into like tracksuit
bottoms and a jump through and it's got
like coughed I'm like on the uncles it's
like a really nice nude color though so
I'm going to try it on and see what it
looks like but let me know in the
comments if you think I should keep it
or not because again it's one of those
things that'll be really confused so I
feel like I could just wear it around
the house and stuff I like to pop up the
shops anyway but I don't no one else I'd
wear it so I'm sort of torn but I wanted
to get it because it looked really cute
on the model with like a pair of
trainers and I got it in a 10 it looks
quite wide on the shoulders like I'm
hoping it's not going to be too big oh
yeah we shall see yeah we danced the
last thing felt like we'd never get
there this is the last thing I got from
misguided so these were a similar style
to like the
get and dress these are just actual
jumpers but they've got the same sort of
like cutout at the back so they actually
have like the neckline which I really
liked I liked how it was actually had a
neckline and it just wasn't completely
backless and but yeah then they just go
into like a really deep V at the back
and they're just normal at the front the
describe is mixed yarn because they've
got like different colors of wool in
this one's like a baby she want and then
I got one that was like a gray as well
so I don't know which kilometer so no I
think I prefer this one because I could
probably wear it with black jeans better
but yeah I really love the idea of them
and I like the fact that they're quite
long because it's the sort of thing that
I'd wear with leggings and usually when
I've got leggings on I kind of I mean
sometimes I do is sometimes adult I do
like stuff that I have the option to
cover my bomb but you know what I mean
because then it's like and took it and
if I want it to look shorter boy it's
still long if I want it to cover my bomb
and it's got like a split hem at the
side as well which is really nice and
then pipe thin so there'd be nice for
layering again I feel like I just pad
them with like a really nice brawler
underneath so you could see at the back
and but they're just nice and casual
nice and comfy I feel like everything
I've got I thought my god dressing yard
skirt and stuff is pretty casual because
I just love my casual clothes who winter
what can I say what can I say slice
finally everything we got from misguided
I just got a couple of little bits from
pretty little things so I'll show you
those now I actually feel worn out like
my voice is burning my throat is burning
from talking for like so long up in
filming this for about an hour so far
it's like shovel that there and hope
that so the first thing is kind of basic
and it's a bit random and they're
basically like wide-leg um jersey
trousers like leggings are like not
leggings because they're not fitted and
but they're just like wide-leg they've
got a waistband here which is stretchy
so they sort of like sit above your hips
on your waist and then they're just
going to like long cotton jogger sort of
material they're really soft and really
thin and but I just really wanted to
pass like chalk on her on the house and
stuff so those are those I got them in a
10 and and yeah I just wanted something
comfy that I could wear like around the
house with like a pair of slippers and
whatnot so the literature just like
black white leg trousers and
got a cropped jumper because I really
love these for like pairing with
high-waisted jeans so that you can sort
of like see your Borman like you waist a
little bit but then you've got like a
slight result on I feel like it looks
quite flattering and this one's actually
got a sort of lattice like knitted
detailing on the sides which you can't
really see very well because it's black
MBI should some cropped hoodie so it's
just got a drawstring again and hood was
really cute and it was really affordable
I just I love the way they look when
it's quite so tunic you start with like
really skinny high-waisted jeans and
some trainers then the module on the
website basically I got a coat which
I'll show you in a minute and she had
like a full outfit on with it obviously
and I loved the outfit she was wearing
wearing it with so I got and a gray
turtleneck bodysuit because she was
basically wearing this a black denims
and not black denim skirt a black
leather skirt which is like the one I
got from misguided and then the jacket
which we're about to show you and it
made such a sick outfit with I over the
new boots they looked really good but
yeah just to layer with stuff layer with
coats layer with cardigans and whatnot I
just love like basic and body suits and
stuff and things that you can just
really sort of work wear this next thing
is a shirt dress because I really love
and show dresses for like dressing up
like meals and stuff just to put we'd
like a nice little pair of like heels
and whatnot I love the color of this I
don't really have many things in this
color but I do think it's really
flattering especially when you've got
like a fresh ready town and let you do
your hair and I say I don't know I feel
like things like this just look really
cute so it just bottoms all the way up
and it's got a collar I do have another
shirt dress a black one that I used to
wear for work all the time when I went
to mark and I loved it like it's just so
easy so I won again and so easy style
but it just looks really good and and
then yeah it just goes into a long dress
so just support heels with for like
evenings out or for like drinks or like
a meal or whatever yeah that is that and
then the curl that actually inspired the
whole shopping spree on pretty little
thing this is a green bomber jacket and
the reason I got this is because I again
I have quite a similar one and from
misguided in black and it's my favorite
bomber jacket because it's long line so
it it's sort of it's just really long
and really pad
I'm really big so this is the outfit
that she hold on she has this great body
sue a black leather skirt disco and then
some black over the knee boots and it
looked incredible so I was so got it in
a small it feels really padded which I
like and it's got like a really nice
Sheen to it you know feel like I'm
talking about makeup now yeah it just
looked insane on the model and because I
love my black one so much I misguided I
got this one because I was on the hunt
for a khaki one as well because kaki
green is a really nice color and for
like the coldest seasons as well so yeah
that is everything
oh my god my throat I got you in explain
how I always get so voice when I'm
filming anyway like um sleeping for a
long time I don't know what it is
just because I'm literally speaking like
non-stop for like an hour straight but
