going to be the biggest clothing haul
you have ever seen in your life I
already know is I already know I even
literally shopped so much like so much I
honestly don't know what came over me I
don't know why I thought it was okay to
spend so much money I don't know well
just say now quick disclaimer if you
have an issue with girls or boys or
whoever spending lots of money on
clothes and things that aren't you know
necessary feel free to click off this
video now because this is definitely not
for you and I do also like pay for
everything myself like I spend my own
money on my clothes and it's not invest
in myself so that's just something that
I want to put out there now for anyone
who's going to be iffy in the comments
don't try it so I'm going to start with
misguided okay so the first thing that I
picked up is a white blouse and it looks
like so as I just said I have got a lot
of blouses because I don't know I feel
like it's just something that I never
really wear and I feel like an Isis ring
and summer because they're quite light
and you can you know sell them in
different ways and things like that so
this one is just white and it's got a
ruffle here it's basically around net
with the buttons down the middle and
then it's got off the shoulder like
cutouts here and then it's just got a
ruffle that goes all the way across like
on to the sleeve as well and then it's
got wide sleeves there's a name for
these and I don't know what it is it's
kind of a little bit cropped it's not
super long I don't know how I feel about
this yet this is one of the things that
I'm like not on dispenser on yet
I'll probably just try it on with like a
pair of jeans and stuff and see how I
feel about it because I don't know if I
like it and if I'll get any news out of
it and but it is really cute / Springs
from the time very girly and you know
pretty and stuff so that is the first
thing if you want to know for reference
as well pretty much everything is in a
size a just because sometimes people ask
me like what my size is for like when
they're shopping online and stuff so
pretty much everything what's the story
pretty much everything I get is in a
size 8 next thing again at by misguided
this is one of the black items one of
the few black items and this is just a
choker cross out pop so as you can see
we can't really see but it's got like
the choker neckline there and and it's
just short sleeves it's kind of similar
might be weld it's like that other
Chocola type that I got from ascribing
that's long ago and that's the reason I
got this one because I love that one and
the one thing that's different though is
the actual is so much more extreme
like when I put this on my boobs was
just like out at the top I was like are
you actually kidding me so I might try
and find a way to style this we'd like a
bralette where it's like you know the
sort of violets that you can wear and
they can be on show and they can look
pretty and stuff and that's probably the
way I'll try to wear it but again just
like a little t-shirt for spring and
summer how many times are they gonna say
that it's like honestly someone get
count on next thing is a little racer
part because I saw this on the model and
she was wearing a shirt that I have from
misguided as well like the black
distress shirt and I just love the way
it looks and I feel like it's just such
a dinky little like a versatile piece to
have so it's just a recent neckline got
no sleeves and then it's just got the
black netting at the bottom the one
thing I'll say about this because
obviously I've tried it from then on the
actual head is quite tight like I have a
normal to large size head I would say it
kind of like hard to know your head
measurements but it was a little bit
hard to get on my head and it is quite
like small fitted so this is one of
those things that I maybe would have
gotten in especially if you're a little
bit Bastia but either way super cute
yeah that's that I got two pairs of
jeans from misguided these are both
sinner high waist authentic rip skinnies
I'm really pissed off because basically
I've got them both in an AE as I search
and the blue ones are like they were
nearly like a little bit too tight I'll
show you
you'll see what they're like in the clip
I really want to keep them because I
love the style of them but someone tell
me like do they look okay because I
don't know basically just high-waisted
skinny jeans and then they've got
distressed parts on the actual leg
itself and the blue ones I just love
because I love the color of the actual
denim I feel like when it's like a blue
denim color it's so hard to find a color
that you actually like or is these are
nice because they're like not too bright
or like saturated and but not too dark
either they're kind of just like a nice
wash color and then the other part that
I really like is the uncool and it kind
of like cuts off at the bottom here as
you can see and I feel like it just adds
a really nice detail like the sort of
jeans I would love to I would like a
pair of heels and like a blouse and then
the black ones are
pretty much the same but as I said they
are a little bit bigger fitted I don't
know if it was just a pad I got the
ankle is slightly different it still
distressed like it's still frayed off
but it's not as like messy and then it
does also still have like the rips and
stuff down to the leg so again just a
pair of black high waisted jeans these
were so comfortable and yeah black jeans
are just a staple I can't believe I'm
not hard like I genuinely haven't had a
pair of jeans that fit me for like five
months like honestly I just I don't even
know what's been going on okay next
thing which I wish it shown you first
because this is the thing that I love
the most
this is a bikini from misguided again
and I saw this probably a couple of
months ago on the website and they
didn't have it in my size and I emailed
one of the girls I know what mister I
didn't she said she wasn't sure if they
would get it back in stock so I've just
been keeping my eye on it and I wrote
back on it the other day and they had it
in my size and I was like yeah honestly
like that is the best feeling ever
literally the best clean of it when you
want something so bad and it's not any
size and then it gets restocked new size
it's just like that just makes your day
it's really hard to show so I'm not
gonna bother showing it but you'll see
it in the tram clip it's just a choker
bandage bikini so snug and like well
fitted very flattering because it's
quite high rise on the briefs sick
material you know like it's not going to
expose units or anything like that and
comfortable I'm only a c-corp unlike the
bandage bit like the banjo bit sorry
doesn't feel like it's going to come
down or anything the one thing I will
say about bandage and swimwear I'm
misguided is you can't from here next
thing is just a blouse again this is
just like a nude color kind of like a
peachy color it's quite warm got these
similar they've all got like all the
buzzers I've got lost some of them a lot
of them I've got this style of sleeve
where it's kind of like why towards the
end of the sleeve what is Li the name
for that someone tell me it's got some
little cute nefi bits here and then also
again like on the actual center this bit
ties up you'll see it better in the
Tryon clip again just like pair with a
pair of jeans or something nice and
light and pretty and elegant and daytime
or evening I just feel like I've just
seen so many blouses recently and I was
like I don't know why I don't wear them
because they're just such a nice pieces
so that is that one next thing I got is
a pair of black cigarette rouses and
again I have not had a pair of cigarette
trousers that are sitting properly and
so long but I now fit back into my
original size I'm misguided so these are
just yeah black cigarette trousers the
reason I've got them is because I loved
the detail on the waist just a really
long zip which is so nice like if you
ever see trousers with a long zip and
you have a big bomb there for you
because like they're long enough to get
them over but they're still tight enough
on the waist like it's just it's a dream
come true honestly and then it's just
got a little ring ballot and they just
go into the garage houses so again the
evening and things like that over day
time I don't really know I haven't worn
a pair of cigarette trousers in a while
so we'll see how I style them but those
are those next thing I got is just a
khaki skirt just looks like so it's an
a-line skirt which means it's skinnier
on the waist and then it goes out a
little bit in the shape of an a I love a
line skirt and when I like not lastima
but this number four I just lived in
them because they're so comfy and it's
so flattering like especially if you've
got a little bit of a slimmer waist in
proportion to your hips because they
don't like hug your hips do you much run
anything like that they're usually a
really nice fit and this one is a second
nice suede material and it's just got a
little belt here like a little belt
detail with a button and then it's
Papa's it all the way down which is so
handy again because it means you get it
over your hips but it fits on the waist
so that is that it feels so nice and
soft and then they're slicing I was so
excited about because I've always wanted
a pair of wide like trousers but again I
don't know why I just found them so hard
to fit last year that I didn't have any
and so these are just a khaki green
again I feel like cocky cigarette rouses
and cocky like wide leg trousers and
just like a really nice color because
you can wear like a white top a black
top gray top but and they don't look
like too boring or anything so yeah
they're just wide-leg fit perfectly
there are size a only thing is like
because the zip doesn't go down as far
it's a bit of a struggle getting it over
like the hips and the bomb region but
when it's on they fit perfectly on the
waist and they just feel snug you know
they're not going anywhere like they're
just they're yummy
okay and then on to boohoo so boohoo is
a place that I shop when I want body
suits because there's whole section of
body suits genuine
as tall and it's genuinely long enough
for me the first one is just a white
sleeveless round neck sort of polo and
like turtleneck
situation like so just goes into a body
sue and just a really good staple I've
not got a good white body sue and I
needed one and then I got to the same
but in it different colors so and this
is just the style of it it's just
basically like where is this like
scalloped neckline is that what you'd
call it yeah like a scalloped edge so
this is just the white one it's just
like two straps
it's got like a v-neck it's a little bit
like big here and like on the boob area
it's nothing like crazy and you just
have to be careful about the type of bra
that you wear with it and then it just
goes into the body suit so I got it in
white and then I also got it in nude as
well because I just thought that this
color of nude look really pretty okay
and then on to proceed little thing this
this first thing sorry is going to be a
lot bit hard to show but you'll see it
in the clip basically just a long white
blouse and it ties in the center so it's
got long sleeves that I just cost and
it's got a color and then it's got no
buttons on it you just tie it on the
center like and it sort of comes in
where your boobies are and then it just
flows out and it's got slits on the side
as well and I just thought it'd be
really nice would like a pair of skinny
jeans and a pair of heels like evening
or like meals owl or like nights out
drinks and things like that is nice and
elegant but a Bardot M blue denim dress
so this is just what it looks like sits
off the shoulder its elastic which is
nice because obviously like it fits
relatively well on the arms got tied its
sleeves like so that and then it's just
got brown buttons all the way down the
center and it's also got a raised hem
which I really like in the sense that it
comes a little bit shorter at the side
of the leg which I love I love this in
light dresses and skirts because I feel
like it looks really fostering on your
legs and that is that one I just thought
we really nice for like daytime with a
pair of trainers and all like on a
holiday with the pair of sandals and
things like that oh this one was
actually misguided this is escaped into
my life pretty little thing a pile so
this is a white dress and it comes in
two separate parts it comes with like
the underlay what this actually called
it comes with like a slip if you like
and then it comes with the actual dress
which looks like so it's like Oh
I sort of really got a high sterling
napkin and it's not like polka-dots and
then it's got frilly little sleeves as
well again not something that I'd
usually work well I tried it on and I
really do like it so I feel like in some
of the time with like a pair of lace-up
sandals this would look so so pretty
doesn't cling to anything like my hips
are a little bit wider than the rest of
my body and it just looks really
fostering on it's a little bit oversized
which I like and it's just nice and
girly and summery and then I got two
more blouses the first one is just a
nude color they're both in the same
style is that other blouse that I got
from pretty little thing in the sense
that it like ties up around your boobs
so the first one is nude and this one is
quite tight on the arms like when I
tried it on it fits but it definitely is
like tight on the arms got a different
kind of color it's not one that folds
over it kind of just sits if you're not
I mean like you'll see it in the clip
and then again it just ties around at
the waist and it's got too little and
well too long straps to do a bow if you
want like a good way of Tiny's I always
wear I would wear a bra with it this is
the way of sales in the clip as well I
wear like a nude bra that's pretty much
a Braille it like not a wired one or you
can wear a white one if you won and you
just thread the straps through the
center as you brought here and then tie
it and then you know that it's
definitely always going to cover your
bra like that is the best way to do it
and other one which I also really love
is just this white one which is pretty
much the same style but it's a look it's
like a slightly different material it's
a little bit thinner it's also got a
button and like a little strap on one of
the sort of sides if you not mean so
like you put it on and then you button
one of the sides into the other one and
then you can tie it so again it's a
little bit more secure than just like
tying it off again just to go with like
oversized jeans leggings wide leg
trousers things like that I just really
like them I feel like they're just a
really nice style of lao's and I'm
excited to wear them okay and then I
also got a leather biker jacket because
I've been wanting one for so long this
is from Miss Selfridge but I got it on
the Asus website and it's just in a size
a because I prefer them a little bit
more fitted like I would usually go up a
size in a jacket but I feel like with
biker jackets I like them to fit and it
keeps them nice and tight on the
shoulder region as well so this is what
it looks like it's just cool
and it's just got like silvery Goldy
straps at strap sorry buttons and it's
just got zips and things like that so
it's nice and crotch I feel like it just
looked really nice as like skinny jeans
or like wide leg trousers just something
to pop on with outfits
I'm not how to bike a jacket again that
I've loved for a really long time so I'm
hoping I'm going to get some use out of
this one kind of heavy for summer I know
but like obviously living in Manchester
we don't always have a cement when it's
so sweet summer so hopefully it will
still come in handy this was 45 pounds I
realized I'm not so the prices for
anything everything and I honestly can't
remember what everything will be linked
down below okay so I just went I got the
last of the stuff my nipples are
slipping now so onto River Island and
Topshop this is where I stopped up on
jeans like literally I'm a little bought
the whole shop okay in fact the
first thing I want to show you I'll
start with river island this denim
jacket oh my god I'm obsessed I don't
know if any of this stuff will be online
for a Ryland but I will link it down
below if it is it's just such like a
good color of denim like especially for
a denim jacket because I tend to wear
them would like not that I've had one in
ages but I used to wear them with like
black card games and stuff because I
feel like unless you're going to white
denim shorts like I wouldn't wear it
with jeans if you're not mean because
I'd double denim not too sure but it's
just the perfect color to go with like
black leggings
so it's kind of distressed it's got like
little holes and like distressed bits
all over and then it's perfect for like
rolling the sleeves up I've gotten
buttons all the way down it's got a
really big chunky collar two pockets at
the top and it does also have pockets in
the actual jacket as well which I love
because my last one it did in I just
looked at it's one of my favorite things
before I'm not gonna lie I'm obsessed
with it and then I got two pair of not
to pass to pass I got two pairs of mom
jeans as well because Reza's right like
I tried the science store I went into
River Island and pop shop in store in on
Dale this is the first time I've ever
tried on a pair of mom jeans that fit me
perfectly on the waist like I didn't
need a bell
I was mind blown I really want
I was like what is this sorcery so the
first pair I might take these back just
because they're a little bit tight on
the actual leg are in a size 8 both of
them are size 8 again and they fit
perfectly on the waist but this one in
particular because it's got such large
like holes and like distress chip
distressed areas and it's kind of higher
on the legs so it is kind of self Ridley
grim but you know when you've got
distressed jeans on and they're a little
bit too small for you and they make you
skin like bulge out of the jeans I'm
sure you know what like I'm sure you
know that is what these jeans do to me a
little bit like it's not crazy I'll show
you the clip I'll put it like here so
that you can see what it looks like it's
not crazy but when I'm walking around I
can just feel like my little skin is
just trying to light escape these
friggin holes or like Hannah please just
take these I probably will take them
back just because I did get another pair
as well so there's no need to like have
both if I'm not going to wear though but
I just really like these because they
are just super distressed and they've
got like massive holes but yeah I don't
know tell me what you think in the
comments when you've seen the transcript
these are 42 pounds so they were not
cheap boys and girls and the thing that
I love about River Island mom jeans as
well is that on the back right they have
this little V at the back and like it
just comes in so well at the waist and
it makes you born look so perky which
Topshop jeans don't have I'll get these
bad boys in a minute and then the second
part of mom jeans from River lalala
River Island very similar but they just
feel a little bit bigger for some reason
they're still an 8 and they just feel a
little bit bigger a little bit more
comfortable they've still got distressed
bits but they aren't as crazy so there's
not as much leg on show there's no like
actual holes they're just kind of like a
little bit ripped here in there again
just a really lovely color of blue but
again they were 42 pounds really liked
them just to go with like body suits and
like blouses and things like that I feel
like I'm just like mixing the game up a
little bit with the stuff that I wear a
minute and I'm really excited to it
style them because those of you who
watched my holes and know me well will
know that I have been on the hunt for a
good pair of mom jeans for forever and
then from Topshop I got two new pairs of
Joni jeans because my old Joni jeans
which were the previous jeans that I had
before fit me anymore
and there was too big for me because I
got them when I put a little bit of
weight on so I have to go back and get a
new pair and I wanted to actually go to
the store and make the effort to try the
mine I don't usually because like I just
got it's just me that hates trained
jeans on like especially skinny jeans in
a store because I feel like in the
fitting room she's so hot and bothered
as it airs like there's never aircon in
there and I feel like trying to get
skinny jeans on in a hot environment
it's just not fun so I was actually
really happy because I spit back into my
old size like when I was 16 like before
I put like any sort of like little bits
of weight on I fit in select my hold old
size so I was just so happy about that
these are just plain black and then I
also got a pair of plain blue as well I
didn't try them both on because like the
black ones are just black and you can
see the style of them with the blue one
yeah Johnny jeans are super high waisted
and super skinny they're my favorite
jeans that Topshop does because they're
so flattering on the fair the nice and
thick they don't lose their shape in my
opinion and even though they're like a
struggle to get on when they're on
they're on and they're like dad to stay
like they do not move throughout the day
yeah I just got a blue part and a black
pair because everyone needs skinny jeans
in their life I got a pair of denim
shorts these are a mom style and it just
looks like so they just really grabbed
my attention because I don't know what
they remind me of a pair of shorts that
I had some misguided not so long ago
well I think that's long ago it's like
three summers ago they are very
distressed so they're not for everyone
and what kind of Lies are not the sort
of thing that I would wear at home that
the sort of thing that I'll say for
holiday yeah I just love the color of
them they're like a really nice light
wash denim you've got two little pockets
on the back and they just might seem
distressed and cute so those are those
and then this pair of shorts is going to
have to go back
basically I tried everything on and then
I made my way to the checkout and then I
saw this pair of shorts as I was going
to check out and I was like I cannot be
asked going back to the changing rooms
again so I'll just get them I just loved
the style of them because they have this
like high-rise at the leg here which I
love in like and skirts and dresses as I
said before but oh my god I may as well
just be wearing knickers I'm not even
like tried them on and guys there's so
much cheese how is not even funny like
some things you can get away with like
there's a little bit of cheek with these
and I feel
on holiday that's okay but these no I
can't do it can't do it myself
oh really cause yeah unfortunately
they're going to have to go back if
you're like if you're going on like a
girls holiday or something this year I
feel like these could be quite fun if
you like to have a bit of Kiko and stuff
but they're not the sort of thing that I
would wear on a normal holiday like I
probably would wear them on like a girls
holiday and then last but not least I've
got two pairs of mom jeans again and
seen as I got two piles of blue ones in
Rover Island I've got two black pairs in
Topshop so these again they fit really
well I do go up a size in the mom jeans
in Topshop so I get a 28 waist a 32 leg
whereas in Jony jeans I got a 26 waist
32 legs these are just all black and
they've just got one massive hole on the
knee unlike I just really like it
because they out of the two these fit
better the same size is it suede like
the same sizes but these fit me better
and I just love the fact that there's
nothing but one big hole because like
this part of the leg is always a lot
more spacious than this part there's no
issues with skin bulging out in these
boys and girls and other pair is still
black but they just have to stress all
the way down so they don't have any like
massively big holes but they do have
some like as and when I haven't actually
got a pair of mom jeans that aren't
distressed but I feel like this dress
one's just like look bad I don't know
just like a nice sort of washed black
but not like a true black they're kind
of like a charcoal like a wash flat okay
and then all I have left to do is shoes
which I don't know if I'm going to try
these on because I forgot to film a try
and quit for them and there will be
links to it down below as well okay so
the first part are just a gray handle I
actually have a gray handle a gray heel
I don't actually know where that came
from
yeah these are just great heels I
actually have these in black as well
what I saw the grey and they're in the
sale at the minute I think that's 21
pounds so I thought I would pick them
off as well if you watch my last haul
maybe it was the whole before I said
that these are massively comfy and I've
had like a play around with the way that
I do the strap and stuff and I've made
them a little bit funkier than they
originally were but because they're a
small heel anyway like they're not
they're not awful to walk in and I was
probably just being a drama queen less
on line got them in a size 4 they are
wide fair and
I feel like a sauce wide fit shoes I
like super wide okay and then I got two
of the same style but in different
colors because basically this is the
same situation as the bikini situation I
saw these online and they didn't have
them in my size and I was like I really
wanted them and then I went back on him
not so long ago and they had my size
again and I was just like oh my gosh is
when that happened it's meant to be I
got them in black as well as showing
black ones too but they're just little
sandal heels like so they've got quite a
thick heel which I like and then they
just lace around the leg which is my
favorite part about them because I love
lace appeals I feel like they look
really pretty so those are the pink ones
and then the black ones just look like
so so exactly the same and just got like
a nude sole and then just got the black
heel here and then it's a lace-up
section at the back where that uncle is
there so those are those I'm hoping
they're not going to be too big probably
soaps that they are like my otherwise
fit shoes makes also quite big around
here but some of them are okay so
fingers crossed
these ones are okay these are from new
look and honestly as someone with wide
feet new looks do the best wide fit
heels ever because they're comfortable
and they're the perfect width like some
of those ones like I said a too wide
these ones by new look are perfect so
these are just a little pink heel and
the cross very little strap at the front
is really soft as well they do these in
this color and also a gray color I
believe but I don't have a pair of nude
sandals that I love at the minute so I'm
hoping that that is going to be bees now
that I have them like I said I've got
them on me so I'm pretty sure they will
do them obviously on new-look website as
well and I have seen them install other
thing that I like about them as well
it's it got a really sick and like not a
stick platform but you know when it's
like a stiletto heel and it's really
thin on the bottom and it's like walking
on friggin rocks and new-look always do
them a tiny bit thicker so they are a
little bit more comfortable to walk in
as well which I love so those are those
and that it's pretty much everything
I've got so I really hope you all
