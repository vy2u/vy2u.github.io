to be a boxing day haul I know another
haul I promise this is the last one for
a while now but I feel like you have to
unbox and it just has to be done I hope
you all had a wonderful Christmas of
course I'm actually filming this on
Boxing Day so Christmas was yesterday we
all stayed at home for Christmas this
year and it was so lovely we cooked
Christmas dinner in the new kitchen
stuff and my Nana and Grenda came around
it was just a really lovely day so I
hope you all had a fab time as well also
don't mind my hair today I've not
watched it for a few days so it's just
in one of those phases where it's just
doing whatever the hell it wants so okay
everything that that I picked up for
this haul was from pretty little things
so of course everything will be listed
down below as always so I'm just gonna
hop straight in okay I'm gonna start off
with accessories as always so the
earrings I picked up from pretty little
thing I kind of like hoops but not at
the same time they like a cross between
hoops and like tassel earrings because
they're really in style at the net so
they just look like so I'll give you a
little close-up so as you can see that
kind of like hoops but at the same time
they've got tassels I think they had
these in a couple of different colors
but I obviously love wearing black so I
thought these would go with a lot of
different outfits and they've got the
gold on it as well which I really like
and then there's also a little diamond
tease and stuff as well I can't remember
much they were I think they were like
four or five pounds earrings are always
really inexpensive from pretty little
thing and stuff which is fab so I'm
really excited to wear those these are
just a pair of clear aviators so they're
they're gonna be really hard to show
like not on my eyes you can kind of see
that so they're basically just clear
aviators I'm not sure how I feel about
these yet I feel like these were a
massive trend this year and I don't know
if there's something I can pull haha but
I really like the look of them I like
the fact that they're quite small as
well they're not super large aviators if
that makes sense like some of them
literally take up half your face which I
feel like if you're gonna get clear ones
I'd rather they looked a little bit
smaller I don't know how I feel about
these let me know what your thoughts are
in the comments down below I definitely
am NOT a fan of the silver I feel like I
prefer the gold okay I'm - actual
clothes the first thing that I picked up
was a banjo because anyone who knows me
it knows that I love a good Brando to
pair with like white like trousers and
jeans joggers literally anything pumps
highs or skirts wise to be honest I feel
like they're just really versatile
things so this is what this one looks
like and it's kind of like a check
tartan style I've been really liking
this sort of print at the minute I
bought a kind of pinafore dress from
Topshop in this kind of print as well
and I've just been really enjoying it
oh very lovely mangoes are always really
well fitted as well so this one it
fitted like a glove I got it in a size a
and because it's only a bundle and
pretty sure it's like ten pounds or so
on the website which is fab so that's
kind of just for layering and pairing
with other things that winter and then
of course wearing in summer as well I
picked up a sweater / jumper slash
knitwear piece knees I just can't get
enough of in winter I love having a good
selection of knitwear I feel like it's
just all you are it's pretty much why I
live it so this is kind of like a beige
on that kind of high neck jumper it kind
of rolls over the neck so you can have
it high or low and like I said it's
beige it's kind of just ripped and stuff
and then it's got this kind of Berk and
get stripe on each sleeve the sleeves I
really like because they're really large
fit and for some reason it just makes it
feel even more cozy cuz it's just so big
and oversized I just really like this it
was a little bit different it kind of
felt a little bit more interesting than
normal just basic knitwear and things
like that so I'm excited to pair that
with jeans and stuff like that I picked
up a sort of like peplum bralette
because I have one of these from
misguided and I absolutely live in it
like whenever I go out and stop it's one
of my go-to pieces because it fits so
well so this one like I said it's
pathalam the Tryon clip for this is so
cool because it's got all these kind of
I don't really know what you call them
it's kind of like just shininess yeah
it's kind of sparkly when it hits the
light you can kind of see that anyway
but in the Tryon clip it looks really
cool and the peplum is really nice it's
kind of just a cropped brawler and then
it's got quite a deep v core the only
thing that I don't like about this that
I like about my misguided one is the
fact that you can't adjust the straps on
this and for me it's a little bit too
kind of big on the chest area I feel
like I can't really feel it like my
boobies ain't big enough kind of the
only thing that's a little bit annoying
I'm gonna try it and maybe tape it or
something like that because I do really
like the top itself and it's very comfy
one it's just a shame that you can't
really adjust the straps I feel like
that's such an essential thing with
bralets because everyone just has such
different chest sizes and stuff if you
like the sequins and like the glittery
effect who's really Christmasy as well
so I had this in mind for like New
Year's Eve even though I have no idea
what I'm doing for New Year's Eve yet
but still okay so next thing is a green
velvet kind of blouse top the situation
I'm obsessed with velvet I mean look at
this on camera
it just looks absolutely stunning Green
is a color as well that I always love to
AB I never think to wear if that makes
sense like I always forget to buy things
they're green I don't know if that makes
any sense at all I saw this on the
website and it looks really really
pretty on the model again just to pair
with like jeans and white leg trousers
and stuff like that the only unknown
thing about this again is I feel like
it's way too big on the chest because
the way it does off is basically with
just a little tie at the front which on
the model it looks really really pretty
and like dainty and stuff but it's kind
of hard to adjust it against like your
own chest area and things like that so
again I'm gonna try and tape it and see
if that works but because I do really
like the top it's just annoying that
it's a little bit big again I got this
in an a I get pretty much everything in
an 8 in case you wondering and the
sleeves have a really cool detail that
kind of like ruffled bell sleeves and so
they just go into like really big chunky
over-the-top bell sleeves which I'm
awful I'm all here for okay next thing
is a cropped knitted jumper
again I'm pretty sure I ordered this in
burgundy because it basically is in two
colors on at the website I ordered this
in burgundy but for some reason I've
ended up with the blue one so I might
exchange it for the burgundy one cuz I
feel like that's a color that I would
wear more so than baby blue but I do
actually really like the color after
trying it on so I got this in a small
medium because it comes in small/medium
or medium/large and it's basically just
a simple kind of knitted ribbed it's got
like different textures and effects with
like the net and stuff which is really
pretty and again it's cropped just
really cozy really comfy this one is
super soft like it's really soft really
comfortable just cozy and perfect for
winter so I picked that up as well okay
this is probably one of my favorite
pieces in the entire haul I am obsessed
with this it's actually the first thing
that I tried on out of the bag as well
so it's basically a twist effect kind of
knitted it's hot it's not really knitted
it's kind of that was my laptop but it's
not knitted as such it's kind of just
like ripped cotton but I wish you could
feel this because no joke it's the
softest thing I've ever touched like
it's so soft for what it is I don't know
it's just one of those where you order
something and online you have like this
idea in your head of what the material
is gonna be like but this is way softer
in person than what I expected I really
like the Swiss two factor it's got the
twist at the front and the back I just
feel like it adds a little bit more
against like a basic knitwear piece
perfect again for pairing with like
jeans wide leg trousers and things like
that it just I just love it I don't know
there's just something about it that I
really love so yeah I got that again in
a size 8 and it will be linked down
below okay I got a little lingerie piece
because I think it's Jordan he's like
got me obsessed with a pretty little
thing a misguided lingerie like she
absolutely raves about it so since I've
been picking stuff up I've been
absolutely loving it
so this is kind of like a bralette and
well is this joint I think it's just
joined by the targets let's just a
brawler and kind of like free fits at I
like a set a photo of the model here cuz
I'm not gonna try this on just because
it is like cher lace but I love the
color of this it's kind of like a really
deep burgundy color and all the lace
detail is really pretty it feels really
soft on I feel like it's gonna be really
comfortable I'm not you tried this on
yet just because it still got the UM tag
on and basically if you snip this and
you can't return out but yeah just a
little lingerie a little bit of
Christmas larger right okay and then
next up we've got a really soft fluffy
jacket so if you watch my misguided I
think it was my Black Friday whole I
think I did misguided first I bought one
of the really like big comfy fluffy what
collection was it from it was some like
the Jourdan Dunn collection with
misguided and it was like Navy and I
wear it all the time now I'm obsessed
with it so I saw this on the pretty
little thing website and I feel like it
was this like it's a similar vibe but
obviously it's cream instead of Navy
because I can only really wear that one
with like dark outfits so I wanted
something to where we'd like nudes and
whites and stuff like that like lighter
color jeans and things so I picked this
one up this one is again really soft
really comfortable it's obviously it not
as good qualities the misguided one
because
the jordan jeongwon was super expensive
it was quite like a premium collection
and but it's still really nice really
soft
I can tell my cat is gonna love this
because she just loves soft cozy things
but again for wintertime I feel like
things like this are essential it's
super cozy and things like that
I got another banjo crop top this is
obviously a burgundy color and I
actually had it in mind for an outfit
which I'll show you the pants for in a
second I love this it's got really
pretty sort of Fralick detail all around
the bottom and the top really comfy it's
got a nice amount of stretch to it as
well which is fab I actually had it in
mind to pair with these bottoms which
these are sort of like wide leg trousers
and as you can see they're kind of like
a burgundy dark red color as well and I
tried the two on and I love the outfit
but the wide leg trousers are way too
big like they're so big on the waist
like I said I always get an A and they
fit really well on the leg and the balm
but for some reason they were just so
soft big on the way so I'm probably
either gonna exchange these for 6 or
return them but it's such a shame
because I absolutely love these like
there are a lot different to other wide
leg choices that I have as well because
a lot of them are just playing at colors
and these obviously have the stripes and
stuff they're super long as well just to
bear in mind they are so long so they'll
be perfect for heels and stuff but I
wouldn't be able to wear these with
flats and I'm like 5 foot 6 7 anyway so
just in to bear in mind with those okay
next up are some velvet joggers I saw
these again on the website and
absolutely fell in love because it you
guys know so I'm just like eating my hat
you guys know I love a good pair of jug
ears I own so many wide like trousers
and so many job is because I find them
so comfortable to wear but you can kind
of like make them a little bit not
dressy but sort of put together at the
same time with the right shoes and stuff
I just saw these and I fell in love so
they've got stripes down the side as
well you can kind of see a bit there
they are black so it blends in a bit and
you can see a little bit better in the
Tryon clip the only thing I'm not a
massive fan of is the waistband they fit
fine and everything but the waistband
just makes them look a bit cheap I've
kind of hoped that this was a little bit
thicker or something like that I've just
had a little bit more to it or even just
like a drawstring around the waist and
there's just something about this that
makes it look a little bit unfinished
and things but either way I do really
like them and they've got really nice
cuff to bottoms as well and then the
very
last thing is a shirtdress I actually
already have this shirt dress but I have
it in white it's what I wore to my
Christmas party a couple of weeks ago
and I fell in love with that shirtless
honestly thank the Lord that it fit and
stuff because it's the only outfit that
I took with me to like the venue where
we had the party so if it Hunt fair I
would have been a bit screwed so it fit
really well it was a really lovely
length it wasn't too short looked really
nice pad with over the knee boots I did
actually try the white one on in my
Cyber Monday hole for the pretty little
thing hole and so in that Tryon cliff
like it looked a bit Daffy because I
didn't have a belt on or anything it
just kind of looked a bit shapeless so
for this trying clip I made sure to try
it on with a belt and things so that you
can see like see more of a vibe with it
if something sense yeah white and black
are always go to to me so I thought I
would get the black one as well just
again to pair with over knee boots for
evenings our meals out and things like
that but yeah that's pretty much
everything I picked up but like I said I
promise this will be the last haul that
I do for a while at least I'm hoping
genuinely haven't got room for all of
these clothes in my wardrobe anyway so I
do not have any puns on buying any more
soon but I hope you enjoyed it and maybe
got some inspiration for stuff that you
want to pick up as well like I said oh
we had a wonderful Christmas and you're
having a wonderful Boxing Day and just
time off in general let me know in the
comments what you're doing it for New
Year's Eve because I would love to know
I literally have no idea what I'm doing
yeah I've got no plans I kind of just
want to stay at home and PJs like who's
that just me I don't know yeah thank you
so much for watching I'm gonna get going
and edit this video anyway so that I can
spend the rest of the day with family
but thank you so much for watching I
love you guys to the moon and back a
million times over and I'll see you in
the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
