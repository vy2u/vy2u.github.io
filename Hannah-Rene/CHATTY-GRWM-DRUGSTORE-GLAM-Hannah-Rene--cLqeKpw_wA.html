so today Q is going to be a chassis get
ready with me on this makeup right here
which is all drugstore products you will
be happy for here so everything I've
used in today's makeup is affordable
makeup that you can get I like boots or
super job a couple of things are online
as well I just feel like it's been so
long since I sat down how to chat with
you got ready with all of you and we
just did our makeup together and I've
honestly missed that so much there's
like some of my favorite videos to film
and so I really hope you enjoyed getting
ready with me as well I tried to
recreate a similar look to what I had on
in the last video so in Tuesday's video
when I did the Marc Jacobs testing and a
lot of people asked for a tutorial on
the eyes and stuff so I wanted to
recreate something similar but with
affordable products so I really hope you
all like it and if you want to see how I
achieve is makeup then it just keep
watching okay so I'm going to start with
eyes just because we're going for
something a little bit more glass so I
don't really have an eye primer that I
love from the drugstore because I love
my Mac soft ochre but I'm not fun
anything as good as a natural eye primer
so all I'm going to do is I'm going to
take some concealer this is the
Maybelline fit me and I'm going to use
this as a base because you can't just
use concealer after use of primer and
this is a brush from backstage Beauty
it's called the shadow shader I'll link
all the brushes and all the products
down below and so I'm going to use this
to concealer just to blend out on the
lid okay so the palette that I want to
use doesn't have like a good transition
color so rather than using another
palette I kind of want to make this like
a lease or as less products as possible
and I'm just going to go in with these
soap &amp;amp; Glory still apart exclusive
bronzer that we're going to use later
and I'm going to start with the lighter
version like the light decide and then
it go in with the darker side a little
bit as well and just use this as a
transition color in the crease and when
I try and stick to using like affordable
brushes so the brush that I'm using is
again by buck sage Beauty I believe
these about 6 pounds or so so they're
obviously like a lot more inexpensive
compared to my Mac ones and this is the
large eye blender it looks kind of
similar to like a 2 2 a 2 2 to 4 to 4 4
to 4 - I don't know guys I am really
impressed with this brush like it is so
soft and like it just disperses product
like so nicely like it really blends I'm
still building up
same bronzer because like I won a lot of
like I want a lot in the crease because
the next show that we're going to go in
we're basically our wanting is this
palette from next this is one of the
ultimate basics in the shade this is the
smoky and highlight one and I've
actually used this one before but I want
to use like this dark purple here
and it's just a shame like with this
palette like I couldn't leave this part
by itself it's got no transition color
at all and so this again is a brush from
backstage Beauty this is just an eye
blender it's slightly more like tapered
and skinnier as you can see some granese
is on the outer corner and and try it
with the sort of darker purple one here
I'm just going to use a little bit for
now and like build it in yeah laksa
kinda wish it was like a little bit
warmer like it's nowhere near as warm on
the eyes is what it looks like in the
pan like on eyes like purple whereas
there it's more like a burgundy purple
which is kind of strange
yeah I feel about that I feel like we
need like another color in the crease
before we carry on with that because I'm
not feeling out I don't know what to use
now so I use the warm once it's got way
more transition colors in it so that one
looks like so and I'm going to met this
like this color here and like the more
neutral one in the center here and just
like try and make those wet so I'm
putting that like in the crease kind of
like in between those two colors
 just dipped into the wrong one
I'm like why extending it as well
because like we are going to clean this
up with a white so like don't worry if
it gets messy it won't matter and then
I'm gonna start on the other side rather
than starting with the dark one just
build those up all right I'm gonna get
the dark one another go now what's the
owner it's like seeing as I'm already in
this palette I'm just me this once it's
kind of similar and it looks like more
white one anyway oh my god that is way
more pigment to that like are you
actually making gosh okay this is
looking way better good tip when you
like doing makeup and like especially
eye shadow like my mirrors like here but
obviously
have you things right open your merits
really important slightly look back as
well just so that you can see like you
make up at different distances because
it's so easy to just like do it up close
and get carried away and think it looks
good
and then take a step back and be like
who want to talk about my face
okay I'm gonna maybe ruin this but
hopefully not I'm going to take a block
which is up here in the second pallet
they do have a dark shade in that as
well but it's not completely black and I
want black because I'm not going to do a
winged liner today and just going to
take it on the same right tapered brush
I'm just going to press it out so I'm
going to concentrate it like mostly on
the lash line and then sort of like
extend out into like oh that's a good
luck that's like a good amount of
pigmentation this black is like fairly
good I'm impressed because like with
black eye shadow like it's so easy for
it to be like so dry and like you're not
blend because it's like such a dark
pigment especially if it's like more of
an affordable brand right Nick but like
this is really doing well right men take
makeup wise because I'm looking like a
crazy person I'm just going to start
cleaning away lens of the angle it's
completely up to you like how high you
take it I kind of just like I don't know
sometimes I do my eyes that are quite
straight so it like tails off more here
or sometimes I do it more like angled
towards my brow it just depends
right okay and then this step you don't
have to do but this is something for me
like when I'm doing makeup and I'm not
doing when do I know like this is so
important to me because otherwise I just
might like even going to use false
eyelashes I'd definitely recommend doing
this so I'm just going to take the black
and I'm going to take and like an angled
some form of like kinda like an angle
brush or a flat definer or something
like that and we're just going to
basically press this along the upper
lash line like here and that is just
going to like help blend my natural
lashes with my sequins to see the
difference like it just makes the lashes
look way more defined as well even if
you aren't going to apply falsies lashes
that I'm going to use are by a backstage
lashes and obviously backstage beauty's
not technically like drugstore but it is
more affordable and they do my favorite
affordable lashes in my opinion like
these ones are only six pounds so these
are like a cup shape as you can see
I kind of like quite whiskey which is
like the sort of blush that I want to go
for with a look like this when there's
no light now what's in like a little bit
more natural shall we say on the box
they say that in the cells oh ho but I'm
pretty sure these are not so her lashes
and I think there might be in the wrong
box so I listen down below if you want
to get a few cell it's that is what one
looks like honestly like it makes so
much difference like even when it's just
natural lashes I'm just going to pop
this other lash on and I will be back in
a minute I'm going to try like other
primer I'm going to try this product buy
it so from glory this is the speed pump
all day super moisture Marvel and so dry
and dehydrated skin it's not like
marketed as a primer but it basically
says what do you say oh they super
moisture marvelous roll it up like that
just basically says applying to a queen
face and neck for tighter brighter and
firmer smoother looking skin and apply
makeup on top if you need it so I'm
going to give it a go this has like we
really believe me it smells so good soap
&amp;amp; Glory products always smell amazing I
swear ahh this spot is like not a joke
like it's so painful so it's a
foundation I have two new ones from the
drugstore so the first one is the Rimmel
wake me up and this is like the new
version that they brought out which is
anti fatigue and it contains vitamin C
sounds more Michael petit in the
original one service like it seems to be
like more hydrated and like brightening
install there we've also got the Loreal
infallible total called that as well
which I've heard so many good things
about and so I'm going to mix these two
together because I know this one is very
marked and very full coverage and my
skin is just like not going to cope with
a matte foundation right now so I'm
going to mix them together and hopefully
that will do the job I'm using the shade
light sand and in the L'Oreal one and
ivory in this one I've got a little bit
of fake tan on and what I think we like
drugstore foundations I always find that
the oxidized and it drives me insane so
if we like these one should be okay my
god the L'Oreal one is like thick like
that is not going anywhere
yeah remember one is still relatively
thick but it's a little bit more liquidy
probably not be able to tell or
foundation I'm just using a backstitch
brush again this is just a foundation
like
and like the Real Techniques buffing
brush that is what it looks like they're
going to start blending the and oh the
Rimmel one smells I can tell it's going
to be the Rimmel unk's it smells like
all the room folks I have it smells
really good a little bit lighter than my
neck but we'll just warm it up with
bronzer if you need to be oh it's like
take it off and put like a darker shade
on so it's like quite a bit lighter than
- I'm not going to really like cling
into areas of my face like doesn't want
look attractive okay I'm taking this off
a minute we're going to do something
else so I'm going to use my trusty maybe
a man poche barn because this never lets
me down so surely it should be fine this
time and rather than mix in the Rimmel
one in I'm going to try and mix L'Oreal
Lumi magique in with the infallible
coverage instead just because I don't
know something went wrong that and I
can't tell what it was but those who
just did not blend together very nicely
where's I know I love this foundation
and I would use on its own but it's a
little bit too dark for me anyway so I'm
just going to put a smidge of this in I
have not used this in so long guys that
you would be surprised about another
touch this anymore okay that matches
perfectly now thank the Lord
that's applying so much nicer than the
other two mixed together I feel like my
skin just can't take like two thick
foundations like it just will not do it
this is bloody good coverage as well
like really good coverage I mean this
spot is not a Jo vanished
this foundation brush is nice as well
like it literally reminds me of the real
technique one like the Real Techniques
one sorry like the orange one I usually
use my God looks so much better
like so much better but concealer I'm
gonna use who what to use I'm just going
to stick with what I know and use the
Maybelline fit me so I'm using the shade
fifty I'm just going to pop that
underneath I I really want them to come
out with like new shades in this
concealer so badly like I wish they had
a
like a pale shade because this is a
lighter shade and like I can't wear this
unless I have like a little bit of panel
like it just doesn't work on my skin
like you dot now for like waive donation
as well because I always like cutting to
Mike's I'm just like just want to get
the job do it's going to start the whole
entire face with Rimmel stay matte and
any powder brush will do I'm just going
to use my Real Techniques blush brush I
always use this is a part of us because
I just feel like it too big for blush in
my opinion okay I'm just going to do
your eyebrows off camera I do help a
brushes are in fact note which we finish
eyes and then I'll do brows let's do
that so you just want to start by
putting the same eyeliner in the
waterline because we're going for
something it nice and smoky and then
we're going to go back in with the warm
palette which looks like so I'm just
going to take like the medium brown
again which is like yes and a mix it was
like that one as well
shrila to scott black eye shadow on it
moon all right many in pencil brush and
sex that's got black eyeshadow on it
you want to make sure that one dry is
like nice and warm because we've got a
black eyeliner there and otherwise like
I personally just think it looks too
intense if you've not got like warm
light shadows underneath it and you just
want to take the black again and where's
that time so I'm going to take the
opposite end of the brush that we used
before on the upper lash line and you
just want to stamp that into the black
and then just press press that sorry
against the lower lashes because you
don't want like when you put black
eyeliner in the waterline you don't just
want to only use black eyeliner like you
need to smudge it down a bit so it looks
like it's not to start and then make
sure you do your lower lash mascara
because we've done such a dramatic lower
lash line like you really need lower
lash mascara to like complete all and
bring it all together so now I'm going
to go ahead and do brows off-camera I do
have a brow routine so I'll link it down
below if you've not seen it but I'm not
just going to like for you is all over
again so be right back okay so brows are
done always felt like to do is to finish
off the skin and then it do the lip so
starting with bronzer I've got a really
itchy nose all of a sudden oh I said
area we're going to be using o going to
be using it if soul a part of eyes open
Laurie because this is my favorite
affordable brands out like ever and I'm
just going to use a angled powder brush
by backstage beauty again I'm just going
to swirl the two together and just mix
them together and then apply those to
the cheap
excess I like this because it's like not
too wall like it has warm to it but like
your axe with contour as well because I
hit not too warm if you're not I mean
that should collarbones because we are
so extra for highlight I'm just going to
use the falsies palette by NYX which it
just looks like so I'm just going to use
the palest one that coupe that is Brad
honestly like if you don't have this
palette and you won like blinding
highlighters all of those again because
we're not playing not shoulders
and everything where the not okay
and then all we have left to do is lift
maybe I'll try this one actually because
I might use this before I was going to
use and Rimmel do my favorite affordable
lip liners the color spice in the
exaggerated is my favorite one and if I
don't like this and I will use that but
this is one by collection and it's in
the shade nude pink is one of the lip
designers so just going to give it this
adult first there's something a bit a
bit different you know it's not as nude
and I hoped it was going to be real
lighten it with like a liquid lipstick
I'm just a news Cairo by next just
select lighten this up and then to
finish up and I always use two blossoms
I don't know why I'm just going to have
it or even two so I'm going to start
with the gloss me and lip gloss by sleek
this is in the shade Angel Falls and
then over the top I'm going to use one
by syllable gory this is one of the new
sexy mother pucker and lip glosses and
this is in the shade on sugar it's like
a big full-sized version so this is the
finished look I really hope you all
