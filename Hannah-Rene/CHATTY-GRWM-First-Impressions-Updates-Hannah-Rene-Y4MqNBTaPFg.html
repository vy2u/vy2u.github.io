a sit-down chassis it get ready with me
because I feel like I've not filmed one
of these in so long and I'm honestly
just in the mood to chill sit down have
a chat things like that so that is what
we're gonna do today
hence the birthdays so it is honestly
what feels like 110 degrees in here so
don't mind me it's literally so hot I
love doing these videos as like first
impressions videos as well casinos we're
gonna be sat here having a chat I may as
well try some new products at the same
time and give you my thoughts on them so
that's exactly what we're gonna do and
this will just look like a sack of
potatoes right now like what is this so
and the first product that I'm gonna use
I feel that was a really short intro for
me usually a waffle one for so long
first thing I'm going to use is by
Giorgio Armani it's the glow on and
moisturizing balm I can't deal with
myself honestly so I actually went for
breakfast with Miriam from Giorgio
Armani the other day and had such a
lovely time she was so fab and she very
kindly gave me a bunch of products to
try so a lot of them asked in cafes and
things like that so I'm really excited
to try them out obviously Giorgio Armani
is a little bit more on the pricier side
so it's gonna be interesting to see what
their life you guys know I love the
power fabric silk that they do the sort
of like matte full-coverage foundation
so hopefully I'm gonna love these as
well so this is what it looks like in
the pot also I forgot to mention
actually I've put pictures up above my
like fantasy section I don't want to
call this but like my acrylic storage
and stuff let me know if you like them
there or if you preferred the wall bear
I can't tell I prefer I don't know but
actually comes with a lot of spatula as
well which I thought it's really cute
that's when you know a products beauty
when it comes with a friggin spoon
spatula so on the box it just says it's
a glow on at moisturizing balm it's
advanced skincare 4 day long makeup glow
instantly skin feels intensely
moisturized radiant and dewy foundation
is easy to apply this balm helps skin
feel plumper more comfortable and smooth
that all day long foundation that stays
put over time skin feels more supple
soft and luminous so it sounds like
everything I need in my life on a daily
basis ok so it smells amazing and looks
like a little pink mousse it's like a
little strawberry mousse if you know I
mean you're so I'm gonna use oh it's
quite quite thick so yeah
definitely more of like a bottom than
like a Sarah all that is so nice because
it's so cold and my face is like red-hot
right now it feels so good so good okay
so I feel like you kind of choose this
as a moisturizer and a primer but I'm
going to use a primer as well just
because I want to try it a new one owl
so I'm gonna give the Smashbox photo pan
or just like grinding my teeth no thank
you I'm gonna give the Smashbox photo
finish primer water girl
this is silicone free alcohol-free oil
free and never tried this before I'm
really excited to give it a go okay and
then the foundation I've got another
Giorgio Armani product this is the
luminous silk foundation which I have
owned before and I owned it like I
bought it ages and ages and ages ago it
must have been years ago now hello and I
didn't like it well it wasn't that I
didn't like it but I bought a time when
I feel like it was a massive hype on
YouTube like the Giorgio Armani luminous
silk and I just didn't get the hype so
I'm giving it another girl this is in
the shade 6 hopefully it's gonna match
my tongue because it's the same shade
that I have my power fabric in it might
be a bit dark but we'll have to say I'm
gonna use it with a Beauty Blender and
hopefully I can like find a way to like
it I do not like it was forever ago
when I first tried it so I don't know
what it was I don't know if I'll just
applying it wrong or if it just isn't
for me but I just wanted to give it
another girl so yeah I'm just using a
sponge it's probably gonna be a tiny bit
dark but well like blend blend it
balanced out with concealer and stuff
yeah I feel like I'm not doing two tries
to get ready with me in so long and it's
currently Sunday today I've just
uploaded a new video and last week I was
on a trip with NYX we went to 210 Glen I
think it's called it's like a spa
absolutely stunning like oh my gosh
throughout all the new Christmas
releases and also like all the new
elements collection so I think I might
do a video that's like a full face of
like Christmas sets I don't know if
people have done that before I feel like
someone probably has but I thought it
might make a cute video cut so I'm set
that I'm saving them all for that art I
got for some reason I didn't expect that
to be such like good coverage like
that's really covered quite that's
covered like 3/4 my face
banging girl yeah and then Thursday I
was at Thorpe Park with benefit which it
was like the press night for like Fright
Night and I have never been I've never
been to a fright night or anything like
that before like it's just not my thing
because I get scared so easily it's a
joke but oh my god it was so good like
it was such a laugh there was so many
people there like it was just so much
fun we went on about three rides and did
two mazes the maze is they were like
different levels of like scariness so we
went on the sole one first
after being after like going on the soar
ride which by the way was really good I
thought I was gonna like hate it because
of the like vertical drop but it was so
good and the maze it was like scary but
it was like one of the less scarier ones
I guess and then we did platform
platform 15 I think it's called and that
was like outside and you basically like
you go outside and then towards the end
you walk through a completely
pitch-black tunnel it was horrible
luckily I was wedged in the middle of
the group like I was hiding amongst
everyone else no chance I was alone at
the front let's be honest yeah it was
really good it was a good laugh and the
rides are so good I love rides I really
do because I'm in Manchester though I'm
like closer to Alton Towers so I tend to
go if I go to like a theme park it's the
impact if I go to a theme park I tend to
go more to Alton Towers then I'm all
that to been to Thorpe Park once so yeah
I actually got the train home the same
night as well so I got the last train
home to Manchester which was at 11
o'clock it was delayed by like 40
minutes I didn't get home till about
3:00 and then I will literally passed
out in bed time ago so awkward as well
because I got on the train and I'm 99%
sure my dentist was on the same train as
me and I've not been to the dentist in
months I should have gone by now because
I actually paid for Invisalign but
because I've not been wearing them
enough I just didn't I've just like not
booked an appointment and I just said
I'm gonna be tired I need to hide it now
if he ever watches this then hello okay
so actually looks really nice it's a bit
dark hence why I've just spent time like
trying to fix my neck but it looks
really lovely I feel like the beauty
blenders done a really good job of like
lunging out as well
I used to use it with like a kabuki
brush I feel like that might have been
where I was going wrong I don't really
know there are some Invisalign because I
am supposed to be doing ten weeks of
them I've still not started wearing them
Yap I just like can't get into habit
event I don't know why I'm just going in
with Nas radiant creamy I don't have a
new concealer to try so that's why I'm
using this one I actually bought two
shades of it this time as like this is
one of my favorite can see likes it's
incredible and I had the shade vanilla
last time which I'm going to mix it with
now it's a little bit too light for me
when I've got turn on just because it
looks a bit too intense so I got custard
as well which is the darker one I've
just been like mixing though yeah I love
this concealer it's one of the only
concealers that doesn't crease under my
eyes like officially October now it's
October 1st when I'm filming that's and
honestly I've been listening to
Christmas music all day it's not that
October's looking like a really really
busy month as well like probably the
busiest month that I've had all year
I've got something on every single week
and every single weekend it's crazy you
just set it with the Too Faced Born This
Way powder actually really really like
this powder when this was first sent to
me and I first tried it out I wasn't
convinced
but as I've used it more and more I
actually really liked it and it's not
only loose powder that I've ever come
across where I can set my whole face
with it and it doesn't lock chalky or
like dry on my skin but anyone who has
it though I had to cut off like the
layer that shots it so it's supposed to
have like this a little flap that falls
over and shots but I just didn't see the
point of it you couldn't get any
products out when you should like shock
it I have a product here from Make Up
For Ever which they again very kindly
sent over and this is their pro
sculpting palette and it's got like this
dark color in for like cream bronzer and
cons or I'm guessing in so I might try a
little bit I don't want to like go crazy
with this because the foundation is
already a little bit too dark okay so
I've definitely
applied way too much of this you're like
sponges can usually fix most errors
this is blending out really
honestly makeup forever for skin
products and eyes on lips but skin
products in particular like they just
blow me away all the time what do people
do in general the Halloween because I
feel like I never actually end up doing
anything like last year I went into town
in Manchester and just like had a night
out and stuff but it was just like
pointless because town was pretty dead
because it's Halloween and stuff I don't
know like what do you guys do for
Halloween do you like have parties and
stuff or do you like go out or go to
like events cuz it's like Fright Nights
and stuff on if I just want to skip
Halloween and go straight to Christmas
please okay and we're gonna do brows off
camera just because I don't have a new
brow product so I'm just going to use my
benefit products as always and I will be
back in a minute I've come prepared for
softer brass today I didn't really
intend to but that's how it's turned out
so what to do next
boys and girls I might just finish off
the skin so that's done should we do
that yeah so for bronzer two-faced very
kindly sent over eight like the full
collection of their bronzers it was
absolutely insane I love the chocolate
Soleil so I'm really excited to try this
this is the natural bronzer called Sun
bunny which is so cute and it actually
has a little bit it looks like it's got
a little bit of a sheen to it so I'm
excited to give it a go I don't tend to
love bronzes that have a sheen to them
although my makeup forever and Pro
bronzed fusion does have a little bit of
like luminosities loop what you know
just a luminosity it's here and I do
really love that so hopefully this will
be ooh that's pigmented okay so
something else that I wanted to talk
about in this video those of you asking
about the Christmas party that I'm
having if you don't know about the
Christmas party that means you don't
follow me on Twitter and you should
dimension another stuff I might have
mentioned it on Instagram and snapchat
so basically I always keep my Twitter
farm super updated because I just find
it the easiest way to like give out
information to stuff so basically I'm
having a Christmas party which I'm so
excited about it's gonna be in December
on December 9th which is a Saturday and
it's the week after beat kinda in case
anyone was wondering so I didn't when
it's clash with anything I feel like I'm
just like whacking you with my rocks
yeah it's nice and natural
mmm I can't promise but I'm
open there is gonna be I'm hoping the
tickets will go on sale this Sunday when
you watching there so it'll be Sunday
the first weekend of October which is
Sunday the 8th I'm pretty sure oh my god
I've applied to March again she was like
to face products these are so pigmented
I'm just like say so yeah there
will be I'm pretty sure there's gonna be
a hundred and sixty five ish tickets
available and I'm gonna do a full video
about this I'm not going to go into tons
of detail because the video where the
tickets go live is the video where I'll
kind of explain everything but just so
that you know there will be a hundred
and sixty-five I'm pretty sure that
tickets available and they're gonna be
five-pound now which I know I said on
Twitter they will be three or four
pounds it's five pounds an hour just
because and be venue where I'm happy
near other ones controlling the tickets
and putting them up for sale and stuff
and that is the price that they have had
to charge for their time and the space
that we're going to use hopefully that
isn't too much for anyone but within the
price that we then they're like but you
do get your money's worth because in the
price there's gonna be loads of stuff
going on it's basically gonna be like
three hours of like Christmas music fun
like everyone chatting still that gets
chance to meet new people and people in
our little family and stuff and chatting
to me if you want to chat to me there's
gonna be people that are doing makeup
I'm hoping Maddy
while I'm pretty sure my friend Maddy
who has a channel I will put her channel
up here so you can go and check her out
she's amazing I met her at Mac I'm
pretty sure muddy is coming down to do
and like a mini makeover isn't mini
makeovers and stuff which would be
really far and she's really fab at
makeup so that should be really good and
then for her and things the braid bar
come in it can actually confirm that now
which is really exciting if anyone knows
the braid bar do braids as the name
would suggest and I actually had my hair
done by them ages ago
a brass event and it absolutely loved
them so I was like when this came up I
knew that I had to ask them if they were
interested and stuff so they will be
there doing her and again all this is
free it's included in your ticket price
and stuff like that I'm considering
doing mom suggested doing things like
goody bags and stuff for people so that
you have something to take home which
initially I was like I'm not entirely
sure because that's a lot of goody bags
to do but I hoping that compose
something to go
so that all of you can take something
home with you it might be merged that if
I have time to do some like
limited-edition merch which will be like
extra money that won't be included in
the ticket price or anything I'm going
into so much detail which I didn't want
to do because I want to save it for the
video but I'm just giving you an idea
boys and girls in case you are wanting
to calm oh and it's in Manchester
obviously didn't even say that so it's
in Manchester and it's going to be on
December the 9th I'm pretty sure it's
gonna be from 12 till 3 for highlighter
I have honestly saved this for a first
impressions video because I didn't want
to use it I want to see use it on camera
to see what it's actually like so I
mentioned this in the like drugstore and
high-end beauty haul that I did this is
a makeup forever kind of like split pan
you basically design these yourselves so
they have a bunch of different like face
artist colors they have highlighters
blushes and bronzers obviously I got two
highlighters because of my favorite
things in all I for many use of gold one
first I think because my pro like fusion
that I love the most is golden so I'm
just gonna dip in I already know they're
gonna be pigmented because makeup
forever doesn't come to play oh god sake
they never let me down makeup forever
never lets me down yeah that is
hopefully that answers most questions
about the Christmas party for now as I
said there will be a full video when the
tickets go live which I'm hoping will be
this Sunday miss mrs. honestly my
favorite time of year like I don't know
about anyone else but I feel like I come
alive at Christmas like last year when I
did my subscriber gift in I just oh it
was so much fun like I was just in my
element and I know you guys love that as
well and I want to do something similar
this year so I've assumed doing like the
Christmas party which I didn't do last
year and and I kind of want to do like
another gift in video and so depending
like how much everything costs me for
like the party and things hopefully I'll
still be able to do like the kitchen
thing again I want to kind of like up my
game with it though and actually deliver
stuff to people's houses because I feel
like that would be really cool just have
to see you first like how the Christmas
pie it goes and what that costs because
um I'll be fun in pretty much everything
myself
if that makes sense like the ticket
price is just for the venue and that's
it's not for like anything that I'm
higher
or like any people that I'm hiring not
anything like that so Oh eyes I don't
really know what to do I was gonna do
something like super dramatic and stuff
but seeing this I've done skin first I
don't really want to go in with like a
ton of eyeshadow because for our xx that
chair I'm not use my Jacqueline Hill
palette yeah which I'm saving for a
video where it's like three looks one
palette because someone suggested that
and I was like that is the perfect
palette for it because it's literally
got because I asked him the hot in the
hole I showed it in like what kind of
looks she won with it but rather than
film like 101 different logs might be
better I'd suggest um do a video why do
you like three lips in one sort of thing
but I'd have to be a voiceover as well I
wouldn't be able to chat through that
box
speaking of eyeshadows I actually have
about three pallets that I've been
considering using for this video and I
have my makeup revolution and so fleurs
nails one which looks insane her
eyeshadow and highlight palette looks
incredible kind of wait to use that but
I'm gonna save that for video where I
can use both of them in one video so
I've got the new NYX in your element
palettes which as I said we're part of
the launch and like the trip last week
and then I have it the Marc Jacobs I
don't actually know what these are
called
oh the iconic palettes and again very
kindly sent these to me and these look
stunning because we've done quite like a
high-end face so I would say I'm gonna
go for the next one because I know
people sometimes appreciate using like
drugstore pilots as well so I'm gonna
save these again it may be for like
another video or something they look so
pretty though I've genuinely not like
i've swatched them a little bit and they
swatch incredibly incredibly I'll save
them for another video when I've got
like maybe a more affordable based on so
it kind of balances out so I'm gonna use
the earth palette from next I used the
fire palette when I was at the launch
the other day and I absolutely loved it
but can't open it soon as this is a
first impressions I thought I'd best use
one of the other ones so this is what
the earth palette looks like which to be
fair not like when I opened it before
I'm kind of like thinking I might like
this one more and I don't know it's got
like more transition colors I would say
then the fire one I'll get the fire one
so you can see this
the fire Poli which as you can see is
right up my street because it's got this
gorgeous red shade while this one here
and this one here and but the only thing
about this palette is it doesn't really
have a transition color at all like it
has this really kind of pale murky like
greenish brown color but for me that's
like not really a transition color I
don't know it's a little bit too light
and stuff so that's the only thing I
would say but I did use this the other
day and absolutely loved it and I just
used a different like a transition color
from make it weak instead but the Reds
and stuff are absolutely stunning and
I'm thinking I might actually like this
one more because this color down here is
a bit more peachy and it looks like more
of a transition color and then it's got
this kind of like brown shade bow which
looks a little bit better as well just
gonna use this shade as a transition
color and then I'll mix in the brown and
the like the kind of peachy shade the if
I need say got a really gorgeous mattes
in this because it's got this kind of
like maroon color like the top row of
mats is just like stunning cuz it's got
this cocky green in this maroon and this
kind of like cool tone Brown looks right
on my street the brush that I'm using I
always forget to mention brushes I'm
really sorry this is the back sage
Beauty large blender so it's gonna tuck
that in the crease to be honest yeah
it's pretty similar like it's not that
much darker than my skin tone but it'll
do the job yeah what was I talking about
yeah so that's like the Christmas party
stuff and and yeah I'm thinking about if
I can like afford to splurge all the
money on it like I did last year I'm
hoping to do you like another gift in
video but actually like make a video out
of it where I travel to people's houses
and deliver the gifts like personally
because I feel like that would make a
really cool video obviously if I was
going to do it I decided it off and say
like send an email with like your dress
and you wish lists and stuff and let me
know if you okay being like filmed and
okay with hun extra nights and not see a
house won't just be turning lots of
people's houses willy-nilly can we no
I'm just gonna kind of like MIT this
probably not the best idea to mix these
two but like the peach one and the brown
ones I don't really know which one to
use
I'm honestly one of the most indecisive
people you'll ever meet in all aspects
of life then I go in with a clean
blending brush just to make sure I'm
keeping everything nice and smooth I'm
just different ins like them
kolja which is the Fed rundown that kind
of like creating a V with it so I'm just
like sketching it out a little bit with
the brush like so and then I'm just
gonna go in and blend it it looks like
this I always like to pop the eyeshadow
on before blending it out I just find it
so much easier and it's so hard to talk
when I'm doing eyes because I'll
actually sit and concentrate so much how
pretty is that color though honestly I
love like Burgundy's like Maroons clot
so everyone watching on Netflix with a
minute maintain I like obsessed with
American Horror Story um it's funny
because I actually tried like watching
it years ago
well not years ago but I tried like
getting into it myself a while ago and I
don't know like I just couldn't get past
the first episode or maybe have to start
the first episode and then didn't finish
it for whatever reason and like the
first episode of the first season which
was Murder House so when we like when to
start watching it again I was like oh I
don't know about this I don't know if
I'm gonna like it because like I said I
got up really easily as well like I
don't like horror films or anything like
that but it's actually so good like I
love it so we're on freakshow at the
minute app literally like got through
almost four seasons in about a month
kind of like disappointed though because
everyone says to get worse and why
that's like everyone says that motor
house and like asylum and coven and
stuff which is the ones that we've
watched are the best ones and then they
just kind of get like worse and worse
which I have to say I really like free
t-shirt at the minute we're kind of like
halfway through and for anyone who's not
watched American Horror Story by the way
it's kind of like how do you explain it
it's like the weirdest thing I've ever
watched but in the best way possible
obviously each series is like a
completely different story so none of
the series interlock what it does it
kind of does benefit your watching them
like series to series from like the
first one just because the actors tend
to be the same in them so like all of
the actors kind of overlap but obviously
because each season is different they
always play like a completely different
character which I just think is so
interesting because you got to see like
different
tisn't stuff like play different parts
and like have their own take on
different characters and stuff which I
just love and still just using that um
burgundy shade and just like mixing in
with the transition colors and stuff I'm
just like taking my time blending it
because whenever I do my eyes like this
and I do like the wing myself it just
takes me like a little bit longer
but think about doing face first is that
you can do eyes all in one go just gonna
put a brown in the waterline and this is
the Makeup Forever aqua liner in m60
you're just keep it like that and just
have it it's like an old map I look
though I'm just gonna go ahead and do
lashes off-camera I'm just using
backstage Beauty lashes in the style
Melrose Avenue I've never tried these
ones from backstage Beauty before just
because they are full all the way around
as you can see and but hopefully I'm
gonna love them so I'm gonna give them a
go and I will back in a minute okay so
lashes are on I actually do really like
them I didn't know if I would because
they're like not a typical cut I that I
would usually well like they kind of
full full of like in the middle and I
actually really like them so all we've
got love to do is lips I was not saying
NYX so I'm gonna use two of the new NYX
lip products this one isn't as new but
I've not used it before and so we've got
the new NYX liquid sit liquid suede
metallic matte and this one is in the
shade exposed so that is what the color
is like it kind of has the color on the
tube it's kind of like a rose gold I
would say and then I'm gonna top it off
with the next cosmic metals lip cream in
the shade and metropolitan night which
is kind of like a champagne shimmer so
that is the color by itself so metallic
these would be like perfect for
Christmas I'm gonna go on top with the
paler kind of cosmic metal gloss shades
Wow my lips are like beaming though that
is the colors and the kind of like
metallic lip products
I guess so this was pretty much the
finished look let me know what you think
in the comments down below and let me
know if you've tried any of these
