be a current must have an obsession
because I'm not going to be in what
feels like absolutely forever also
before I even start
I'm just going to say I do have a tough
time well the camera doesn't cut quite
enough to like get it in so I'm setting
up yeah I feel like I'm not all of these
in it so long it's kind of good thing
because all of these products except one
so one little products are super trying
and has they're like I've been using
them for so long now and now I
absolutely love them so I really wanted
to share them all with you so we've got
some hair care products some of the skin
products and I self-tanning product and
there's makeup bit as well now that I've
actually laid out in table it feels like
there's not as job because like I said
I've been planning this video for ages
or not planning it but been wanting to
do because Soviet fronts I've been
loving and I feel like I've missed some
out and we so enjoyed it by house so I'm
going to basically do so in the order I
would use it so I'm going to start with
makeup and like Priya Nichol product so
in castle so this is the similar I'll a
CEO I never like I was going to read it
and open some reason why I just stopped
working it's so wet so my lashes are
absolutely wanted me also John my main
and this is the protect and repair see
me antioxidant and with driver I just
looks like there's it's in a really cute
little aren't at all so this is actually
very kindly get kissed me at by some new
variety and I wouldn't use any
moisturizer at the time because of
different out of I think it was meant
under 7 so I decided to do this go
because it was friendly when it just
come in and oh my goodness this is
literally blown any other one choice
I've ever used out water like it so good
so as you guys know I do have sort of
like normal dry skin it pretty much
normal but sometimes it is a little bit
drier and this is just and I like it
because it's so moisturizing like it's
quite a thick cream and it's a lot
thicker than anything I usually use and
it do it completely bill which I
personally like because I do like my
tripod to feel a little bit tacky
especially when I'm going to be doing a
clean job I'd be like
we drive there field a lot with hockey
my skin always looks so much better
after this is like a good thick layer of
moisturization also it smell it smells
so good literally to smell of pure
orange like it's really quite wrong as I
live actual love the smell of it like
it's so summery and fruity is what it
looks like I'm sorry probably not going
to see that and it's kind of like a
yellowy cream is quite thick like it's
what should not running or anything like
that I've been using this but I booked
c1 so I don't see about half of the pot
it's gone because one people said Oh
Riley is a little more party size you
can get on a cult beauty and things like
that so cutie drops a lot of their
products and it's a little bit pricey
but anyone who is looking for good my
showdown is my kind of skin type you
will look this a comment you will look
there okay so the next thing that I want
to mention everyone will see as much
about this this is literally just a lip
balm
I don't even know whether it came from I
swear my makeup collection things will
just make their way in and I don't know
whether come from I don't know if I
bought them at your service my bottoms
it is my friends but it just makes its
way in but this one I'm going to do it
because it's so good so this is by a
brand called London I've never met a
drum before and this is a lemonade with
made with lemon oils so I understand it
in the lip balm and I really really
really struggle to find good lip balms
because I feel like a lot of time the
lip balms will feel good at first but
they'll end up just completely dry my
lips so in the long run I just don't do
the job that you have one job and this
job do it so this one says an ultra rich
and creamy whipped lanolin lip treatment
with lemon oil to naturally exfoliate
leaving lips fresh soft and moist some
people really hate my voice just don't
get it it smells really good it smells
like lemons as you would guess just
feels really soothing on the lips and I
feel like it actually does add a lot of
moisturization like they feel hydrated
and moisturize um
much longer period of time as opposed to
other live arms at use and which is
really good I have no idea how much it
is I'm guessing it's not too much - it's
a lip balm and but I will link it down
below along with everything else here if
you are interested in having an early
but honestly anyone and in jocelyn and
you're the best driver this book is
really good okay and then starting with
actual makeup staff I have one primer
this is the Galan Lauder radiance and it
is cool it's basically the Galan primer
that i used in what feels like every
single video like i pretty much uses
private 24/7 and it's really good it's
so expensive it really bugs me this is
what it looks like as you can see is
very well loved and we actually bought
it and I want it for a whole value it
must have been ages ago that was one of
the first ever video myself in a flaw
which means it must move up six months
ago and then I know I waited quite a
while from about a month after I bought
this until I actually start using it so
I've been using it five months now
I don't wear makeup tonnes I use it
pretty much every time so that is how it
lasted me I would like to know because
it is expensive or it is just so
hydrating like anytime anyone asked me
to describe this I just say it's like
water jelly like that is the only way I
can describe it it's a really
interesting like texture and consistency
it's like any other kind I have it
literally feels like what jelly like go
and feel it and you'll know I mean it
does have a little gold flakes in it so
bushi I don't ever find that the gold
plate is kind of a pair of my skin like
every now and then one will like a chair
and you'll see on my skin but you can
just set wipe it around whatever it
expires I couldn't affect my makeup or
anything like that it just adds so much
radius so much hydration which is very
important for a foundation I must
mention because I have been enjoying it
using a more like sucked in not
completely matte but more subtle
foundations and I always need a much
more hydrated base because my skin is
normal to dry and isn't just amazing
like I wonder some researchers
that which has killed me because it's so
expensive but again with it being like a
skin product I've drawn spending the
money because every let's turn products
when you find a really good one that's
so hard to come across like look like
perfectly matches your own skin type so
again if you in at the market for a bit
more making expected primer and you are
my skin type if Joan visual visible
because it's fun
okay I have it two foundations that I
want to mention so the first one is a
more affordable foundation stood by the
brand of w7 and if you guys have been so
emotional for a little bit or you are
subscriber and you'll know that I did a
full face of w7 makeup not so long ago
it's kind of like a testing video which
I'm going to get back in juniors because
I really miss there and I want to do elf
net yeah a full face of a w7 as never
use anything at fibers before and this
product in particular I look everything
in the video with this product in
particular ruin sort of me so I used a
combination of two foundations I use
this one which is the genius feather
feather-light foundation I'll leave a
link to the video down below if you want
to see what the full thing when it will
have the all the foundation as well and
if I mix the two together because I do
never change it with white rice my skin
tone at the tire this one is in the
shade spot if anyone wants to know it's
quite pale and I did admit to it with
another foundation today I don't ever
wear this on its own I've never seen
tried to spike bells as vivacious but I
just love it and mix in with others like
it's so good in combination with so many
other foundations that I love as well
what I've done today is I've got this
foundation with my back ultimate
coverage complexion cream which is in
the shade it's time and first of all
I'll show you is a way to dark me even
when I've got like a shit ton of the
Atomics lo hago this does a really good
job of sort of lightening it up a little
bit and sort of mash it back to my skin
it also just makes consistency it's so
much better as I'm asking in part
because it is quite liquidy like this is
a really running foundation
and the back one is like bit loose so
it's just so much better than my skin
because it's a lot more like the back of
one inch is where you say like it's
quite as starting a foundation quite
persons market drives down very quickly
and it just isn't the best and once
again unless I have a super hydrating
base but this just makes it like the
perfect foundation super inexpensive as
well I'm not entirely sure how much it
is exactly but I'll leave the link down
below again but I just know that w7 in
general is a really affordable brand and
the other foundation that you could well
was really good too so if you're on the
phone and that foundation has more
coverage as well so if you're on the
phone for like a good sort of
combination - oh that's kind of like a
medium to fall I'll rinse both down
below if you want to have an OD okay
next foundation is the Giorgio Armani I
realized that I was taken for 18 minutes
now so I'm going to try and see what
everything a little bit quicker so this
invite Giorgio Armani this is the power
fabric foundation it is a longer high
color foundation is the newest I believe
the most recent foundation you brought
out and I got this I have had luminous
cells before which is also by Giorgio
Armani but I just researched it because
I just didn't feel like I feel like this
foundation that everyone loves and I
just didn't look and I wanted to give it
something else to go so when I saw that
we brought our underling trees so I
bought it in the same shape that I have
my luminous silk in which is the sage
but for buckets of shade sick so I can
only wear it when I've got panel because
it is a little bit darker and it's just
such a good one it is the first time I
use it actually is not covered before
basis best impressions and why do you
know when I first bought it is it is
super smart with matte finish so again I
was like okay this is not going to work
well my skin because before this I had
never found a sort of like starting
smart
foundation that would work by itself and
it looks good so honestly like it worked
really well it blends out so easily like
I cannot tell you how quickly like how
quick I can just put the Foundation's
which is blends into my skin it so well
don't need a lot because it has a really
good coverage and even though it is more
like a medium to full crush it still
looks like skin in my opinion
sugar all like our version of my team
our shield
Whiteley like he never feels heavy on my
face which again really important with
don't feel cakey and well so that is
that I think people are circus comes to
telling us I'm not trying to show I'll
leave it double it again and I quickly
want to mention it foundation brush
because I've had so many questions about
this brush when I you there and I do try
to blend brushes as best I can but
sometimes I forget sorry you know this
is by the granite looks this is that
large a lot lower
this is that large angled I'm truly
dislike a contour brush it's just called
the large my whole brush actually
brought this anyone from a South because
this is the second one apart airing
right so I think it's meant for more
like Crimson's of Ed Hochuli so partisan
stuff I might highly sure but I just
love it for foundation I use it mostly
with the w7 in the back up just because
when I was an expert in together
I have trouble like a lot of foundation
and this just helps them sort of like
dusty over and just have like a really
even coverage and not apply too much at
the same time with issues so questioning
these messages when they blend like a
jury balloting with my last one is that
it shed so but we like the fifth time we
washed it angry
they let the face a little bit time I
wash it like the bristles just came out
and I was like great but it's not like
the end of the world because it is a
little bit more inexpensive but over in
line finally well considering how much I
use it as well yeah I'm loving that as
well as an off you want like I use my
walkie and for you now with my Giorgio
Armani if I use this with that
foundations are a little bit thicker and
I just like them cleanse and look a
dream okay so your shadow brushes I
quickly want to mention another have
mentioned these in orbit knock knock
residues a fiber Brian efficacious
beauties is a large I Runyan and then
I'm pretty sure this is just the eye
blender which is a little bit more
painful just like the eye Gwenda so the
last wonder is this one here and then
the normal I wonder is this one down at
the bottom and the use have become go to
brushes me for like eyeshadow this one
it just makes such a good like all of
the crease brush
a lot of my Sigma is it my Sigma e-40 on
my map to people yes I don't know it
reminds me a lot of my map brush that
went all over one I use it's a tiny
little bit more tapered it's not as
fluffy and the thing that I realize
about is it's super soft to start as
which my Mac ones can be a little bit
scratchy sometimes that's the only
downside I have some I must women
absolute little bit but it can get a
little bit scratchy this one is so fast
like I wish you could feel it so soft
and I like the fact that it has I
thought if you can reel stabs it just
paper a little bit towards the end and
which is really good for me because I do
like a large foot like a large wonder to
do the crease but I do also like to have
the control with a little bit more of a
tapered end and it just fits perfectly
in a coffee mug it fits so well so this
has become a go-to for like crease and
star just select transition shades and
like blending everything together just
go to brush this one because this is a
little bit more tapered I'll show you
now so that is sort of flat side and
then as you can see it is a little bit
skinnier and more paper I have just been
living it for lower lashline it reminds
me kind of like a c-17 banner because
two brushes that I always have to have
pretty much only eyeshadow brushes I use
are a lot of women and papers wonderful
exercise color and then lower lashline
and it reminds me about this skin you
out in my opinion which is why I love it
because it is a little bit sooner it's a
little bit more precise as well in the
stove which means you can use on a
little lash line I just wanna sing so
well I don't my I feel like I mentioned
this a couple times but I don't like
using a pencil brush on my lower lash
line just because I feel like it's so
stiff and it doesn't blend like how I
want to or a fluffy brush like this but
it still has the same effect as a crease
like a crease brush but because it's a
lower lash line it just doesn't blend it
as much and it still looks really pretty
and let's not over the top it just looks
great I saw wood and again at Backpage
beauty is a little bit more portable and
I'm pretty sure these brushes are like
seven or eight pounds each which
compares like a Mac person a lot more
inexpensive you haven't covered as well
and I'll come
delicious connects Maytag if you want an
extra 10% off
I'll leave only and throw it down below
but yeah I do on the ones like go to
blend brushes and you need to make up in
you know respects money or you just want
to expand your brush collection
whichever life is always looking to
Duke's always good to try and appreciate
their owners I recommend these and like
I said don't expose it and that's damn
good
okay lots of makeup product I want to
mention this is the Rimmel stay matte
this is the only product that I am NOT
used like a lot so I feel a bit oily
point in but I pretty much I've
obviously worn this past three days like
since the birthday I use it and I'm
obsessed with it
I used it in my last video on Thursday
which is the first time I wore it and
then I wore it yesterday to France fest
with a lot going on today that's on my
list and it was initiated like hate to
go operational yes in the shade it
allows you to go which is a beautiful
like brown news it's magic so well so
for me you did my thumb is not going to
cover it the first time I used it I work
with a remote lip liner in the shade
courtesy which is what was doing at my
last video and was very good on the
strip down by Mark which is quite a
brown nudish lip liner and it just
matched so well like it's pretty much
the same color but like a shade lighter
so create like a real and unreal it but
it has the same time I do it so quick
Brown I just love it it reminds me a lot
of these soft matte lip creams by NYX
they're quite a new speak and I like
super liquidy but they're not and they
still apply really lovely and they feel
worked for other lips which is also that
the most annoying thing for me when it's
little dat 6 I just want to feel good
the only thing I would say is they're
not super paid which again reminds me of
those of my lip rings and it's because
it's like only one one thing I would say
about
then it's the fact that you have to do a
couple of coats before you have like a
full coverage and listeners a major like
Rimmel as a lot of you will probably
know it's a super inexpensive brand and
then I hope she's are I believe they're
about seven or eight pounds and they've
got a little arrange of like news rare
dark colored things like that so I will
leave a link down below again I just
really love that feel like it's going to
be calm and go through because everyone
as I said the past three days and it's
always it's not lovely okay quick have a
look that I want to mention is actually
a hair brush so as you guys know I've
always had quite long time but I would
love having long hair but one thing
about having long hair is the faculty to
quit so naughty I thought I feel like
this is my hair every single time ago
perhaps is they always comment about how
naughty my hair cut so quickly like will
brush it out when I'm in a dresses and
then wash it off something and by the
time you brush is so not see again the
work hard as well as like I'm really has
to also assume let's start brushing and
like it's hurting my hair my head I
can't so these brushes are by and wet
brush the Russian bear comes in and over
and I didn't even realize a bit I
realize now obviously but when I first
got them on human healing be actually on
my name on the back which I thought was
a really really touch to just say honey
there are people on in an orange one I
just keep one like in my bedroom and
then one in the bathroom sort wet brush
my hair out insurances or it's like like
after the shower and stuff like that
okay so tell me cut out and I come what
I play and bought yeah I keep one in the
back here and one in my bedroom I was
saying I like to sometimes brush my hair
and comb it out in the shower when I've
got traditional because I feel like
whenever you die it's not a knot you
want to get out of the shower so it sort
of takes me a little bit working to make
it as difficult and I feel like I've
used a lot of brushes like I have tried
many brushes like I had because it just
got soaked it like it's tough second ago
so not see and I've had puddle brushes I
have tunnel teasers which I do love one
handle to those people that which is
made so I think I have and they were
swimming about these like the first time
I usually I just know it how much
quicker my hairbrush
not when and also like how much like it
hurt like it really didn't have much
like how much to brush them up ow they
just fell a lot softer on my hair like a
lot more gentle and ever since then like
I've honestly just got rid of my last
Russian I just took the thieves now I
don't use my penalty that I'm not
shining what either I just really really
enjoy me so thank you for watching Senna
needs over because I love those there's
really made a difference there so a lot
productive but definitely definitely not
least this is one day exams itself can't
erase out which is very recently come
out yeah one of terms have recently
brought out a self tanner eraser which
is of course this hair I'm pretty sure
this is like the first thing on the
market like of its kind I feel like when
they announced they're releasing this
everyone like all self $10 just love the
shit because this is what we've been
needing so long but if anyone is like me
and you just love a clientele planet
you'll know the issue of like there's
nothing bad in a fresh whole but then
when it gets like four or five days but
he's been wearing like the same coat and
it gets so like 50 and like scaly and
it's so hard sometimes to exfoliate off
especially I use love is time and
because it's quite strong like long
lasting time like it lasts about a week
on me but by the time it's like time to
go it's sometimes hard to like get it
off because it is what's so strong and
one question this is amazing honestly
it's so good because it's get everything
off in one girl like you literally apply
this but you pay it leave it at least
five minutes and to say well as the best
results apply to dry skin and after
three days like after the initial three
days of having a brush so on because
anyways not it will be like quite a hit
to the skin you know I mean the
ionization certainly for at least five
minutes Cheryl in warm water using a wet
cloth and sweatpants and straw in areas
or dry skin use the biosigns exfoliation
miss you gently remove that's virtually
what I do I apply it for probably only
about five to eight minutes I guess my
patient when I put it on because
obviously like I create from my whole
body so I have a call there
on my whole body and because it's like
sticky and not fully absorb you can't I
can't do anything in the time frame I
feel life because it's just all over
your skin and so I am a live it for
about five ten minutes and then I get in
the shower and there's issues like an
exfoliating gloves that you can get some
boots and it just does the job so like I
used exfoliated mixin bar I really love
the eleventh challenge because it's
really good at get in town and but then
just does the extra step because
remember what I knew that like sometimes
bits of time will just not come up and
it gets the point where you'll actually
skin so hard like you don't want to be
damaging your skin by exploiting it so
hard if you not need so this is so good
I honestly I wanted self time over get
it because you will love it so that was
everything in this video I really hope
you guys like this and have an interest
in and hopefully found some products
that you want to try yourself
I'm gonna go anyway because I've been
treating white for female our motto is
on fire
I get so passionate and previous videos
become just like I will press this you
need get oh yeah thank you so much for
watching and only go smoother back
million times over and I will see you in
Thursday's video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
