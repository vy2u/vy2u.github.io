going to be a huge cyber monday hole if
you are new to my channel then I
recently did one of these last week on
Black Friday on Black Friday we did miss
Cardew but no it's Monday and we're
gonna do pretty little things so really
excited about this one there's some good
things and some not-so-good things but
again I'm pretty sure pretty little
thing I gonna have a good chunk of
discount so every single product that I
mentioned in this hole will be in the
description bar down below yeah I'm just
gonna get straight into it like I did
the last one the first thing that I
actually picked up is a necklace which
is hiding under this little top this top
it's from pretty little thing as well I
got it a while ago what if it's still in
stock I'll pop it in at the description
with everything else so I don't know if
you can see this little cutie you
probably can't read him but it says Leo
so they have a bunch of these in stock
at the minute which are different star
signs so of course I am a Leo a proud
lion I absolutely love this you know I'm
not really a necklace kind of gal I'm
not gonna lie but I really love how like
dainty this is they do it in gold and
silver as well but I feel like gold is
like more what I'm going for at the
minute which is weird because I always
used to wear silver I'm obsessed with
this like it just looks so cute and so
dainty which I love like I don't like
anything too chunky in terms of jewelry
and if you want to know what the
earrings are from as well they were in
my last misguided haul which I just
mentioned which I'll pop on the screen
here if you want to go and check out
after this right onto the next okay so I
have a little more function okay so I
saw this on the website last week and I
absolutely died at the friggin color and
the texture so this is kind of like a
scarlet velvet body see you and I will
say it's a little bit short on the body
okay so but it's fine because like look
at it okay look at this color and the
actual valve oh it's so pretty she's
just fun so all over I'm sorry but this
is Christmas in a clothing piece right
here the only annoying thing is there's
not adjustable straps which isn't the
worst thing in the world because it does
actually fit really well unlike the
boobs and stuff it's like a thong
bodysuit as well I can't remember how
much this was everything I got pretty
much is in a size 8 as well if you want
to know for reference but yeah I don't
know what I'm gonna wear this with yeah
I have no idea but I let you just saw it
on the website and was like I need that
I need you and then I picked up a
jumpsuit which is gonna be really hard
to show on camera but of course there
are trial Clips for all of these so
you'll see it in like this section here
tonight's core job so I can actually fit
it on the screen this time but this is a
gray jumpsuit so it's wide leg I'm
pretty sure yeah it's wide leg I got I
remember I tried it on like yesterday
the way it works is it basically has
like a cutout in the like belly area
like the stomach area and then it ties
up into a boat to copy your boobs the
only thing is like there's not a lot of
material to work with but like covering
your boobs so I don't know I'm gonna
have to find a way cuz you can't wear a
bra with it because there's literally
that little material so I'm gonna have
to find a way to like use nipple covers
or something because it's not the
thickest of materials I'm not gonna lie
I think it'd be perfect for a night out
with a pair of heels and stuff I just
need to find a way to like make the
nipple section work and then it picks up
a shirt dress because I recently bought
a Gucci bail I know I feel like everyone
and their mothers has a Gucci like GG
belt if you like the other thing of the
moment Gucci helps but I picked one up
and I've been wanting to kind of picture
some outfits and stuff to style it weird
so this is a white shirt dress and I'm
absolutely obsessed with this it's so
cute it looks a little bit kind of like
shapeless on like in the Tryon clip but
I feel like when I wear it with a ballot
will obviously have like a more shape to
it and I really like the kind of texture
of it it's like a really nice soft I
don't know what this is like cotton
awesome in the length is really nice as
well because another thing weird like
cher dresses and t-shirt dresses
sometimes is they're a bit short for me
ball and all I do really love this got a
black and like unitard slash like jump
to crop jump to you whatever you want to
call them this is just a Jersey cotton
it's kind of just like a basic piece to
go with like other stuff in my wardrobe
and just lay out like throughout winter
and things so it's literally just like a
bundle like so and then it just goes
down into little crutch leggings again
pretty thin I'm not gonna lie but I'm
pretty sure these are really quite cheap
on the website fit is really nice so
that is what I will say it fitted really
nicely it was like not it wasn't too
tight or anything the body wasn't too
sure because obviously like a banjo and
you know it needs to be like long enough
to call that yeah I'm really happy with
this I don't know how I'm gonna style it
yeah probably just with like trainers
like an oversized jumper and then like a
big coal I don't really know we're gonna
see how it goes but I do really like
this and we've got places so this again
is kind of like a velvet material and
it's a burgundy color if you watch the
misguided one you'll know that I'm
obsessed with the hair candy at the
minute for like Christmas time the
plunge is really nice it's not like to
really not anything that like that the
shorts are quite short it's what I will
say so it's just something to bear in
mind for those of you who maybe like
don't want to show that much like for
whatever reason I don't know there's no
profit stuff I guess but yeah the shorts
are pretty sure um it's it's nice but I
don't know if I like it on my buddy out
like I like the product but I just don't
know if it's right for me because like
the waist button and stuff like I don't
know if it just sits where I want it to
say it might be a tiny bit shot my buddy
but either way I do really like kind of
like the texture and the color and like
the overall vibe of it and then we've
got another little play suit which I do
quite like this one um so this is just a
navy color I feel like I'm gonna sneeze
I really don't want to because mascara
and lashes but it's gonna come out my
nose anyway I can just we're okay we're
all good bless me yeah so this is a Navy
place ooh which when I saw it on the
website first I thought it was just the
top I can feel another sneeze come in Oh
kind of like a ruffle situation so it's
got different layers going on and then
it's just like a v-neck up the front and
again the v-neck is really nice it's
really nicely fitted and it's got
adjustable straps which are really handy
because with things like this I do like
to have the straps also just so that I
know that I'm not like you know popping
out anywhere yeah I really like this I
feel like for a night out again with
heels and stuff it looks super cute okay
these I am living for so these are from
the shape range and these are basically
like flared trousers so first of all
they've got a really nice waistband the
nice and high-waisted and stuff which I
really love and then they literally just
go out into like flag legs they're kind
of like a what material is this it's
like a slinky like kind of material it's
nice and thick which I really like it's
a good thick material and it doesn't
give cameltoe thanks a lot I just love
this kind of like style of pants at the
minute I feel like again with a pair of
heels on like a night out they look
really flattering on the legs and then
let's go with that we've got a black
bando
so I love these tops from pretty little
thing I have some that have like a cross
out which they still have in stock which
I'll link below underneath these but
yeah it's just like simply just a bundle
top you can wear these without a bra and
they're absolutely fine or you can wear
them with a bra and they're firing yeah
just a simple black bundle to go with
the flared trousers but this QT which I
love this share this is gonna be hard
because you basically have to tie this
so it's kind of just like one big slab
of material yeah it's kind of like this
floral and black shirts got like yellow
flowers on I don't know if you can see
and then you basically tie it like a
crosstie chest and stuff and that is how
the shirt like does up I really like
this I feel like with a pair of
high-waisted jeans this would look super
cute and there's a lot of really nice
ones on misguided at the minute as well
which I was gonna go out with a roll out
I was talking about the high so this is
it you know my alternative and I really
love it got a black leather skirt so I
really like this it's definitely like a
smaller eight I would say than like a
regular hey I don't know it's kind of
like belted as you can see and then it's
got a big long zip going all the way
down it to the bathroom so it's really
easy to get on because you can literally
unzip it like as much as you want to cut
it over you bomb L it is really nice it
looks really nice on I feel like this
would make a really nice kind of daytime
scare and an evening skirt I definitely
think more date daytime with like a pair
of openings and like a crop top or
something like that and then next up
we've got a bralette so this is just
kind of like voices cause you can I'm
pretty sure it's called like an eyelash
yeah Hannah black eyelash lace corset
bralette so it's actually called Hannah
it was meant for me so again with some
adjustable straps which I really love
because like I said I like to make them
shorter on bralets and like v-neck
plunge situations it's just kind of like
a little fluffy bralette which I really
really love Rallis is just so good for
pairing with like wide leg trousers
jeans skirts like you can just pad them
with so many different bottom things
it's black I feel like I got majority of
my clothes in black because black is
just so freakin a versatile like it goes
with everything again okay next up we've
got 8 cropped jumper I love myself a
good crop jumbo because they're just so
cozy and again like always so many
different outfits and things and so this
is just plain white because I've
actually been on the hunt for a while
for just like a white cropped
jumper it fits really well it's not too
short because I've had a couple from
pretty little thing before like crop
jumpers I had a black one and a baby
pink one and they were so short like on
the crop like they basically came just
under my boobs but yeah I really like
this what size I actually got this in a
medium and just so it would be a bit
more oversized I'm like less fitted and
hopefully longer as well and I do really
like it
okay so last thing I this is going back
okay I do not like this at all you guys
know I'm always gonna be honest with
yourself but this is one of the things I
was really excited about and then when I
tried it on was like really disappointed
with though this is like a two-piece
Jersey like joggers and like hoodie
situation you'll see it in the clip here
I'm not even gonna bother like trying to
show you because it's just a big bowl of
fabric yeah it's kind of got this really
cool like cutout what I was initially
drawn to was the hoodie and then I saw
that they did the bottoms is like a
two-piece and I was like oh cool I'll
get like the full set
first of all okay so it's red obviously
the top and the bottom are different
shades of red I'm not even like subtly
like they're really I don't know if it's
just my eyes but they're really
obviously different shades of red like
the top is lighter than the bottom so it
just looks a bit stupid first of all
because they're just different shades of
red and then the bottoms were a little
bit small fitted I do like the bottoms
but they are a bit small fitted so if
you like you joggers kind of like buggy
and stuff like I do then you might want
to size up in terms of the top it just
looks like to me it feels and looks a
bit cheap which is so weird because on
the website it looks amazing which I
stuff always does I know and and then I
put it on and it just felt a bit like
cheap and just like yeah if you know
what I mean so that's probably gonna go
back I'm not recommending this they do
have it in a bunch of different colors
so though so I don't know if like the
black one or I'm pretty sure they've got
like a mustard yellow one and maybe like
a navy blue one I don't know if they're
any better but you can even see on
camera now surely you can see that like
this is lighter than this you see I
don't know I just think it looks weird
and it just looks a bit cheap in general
so that is gonna go back but that's the
only thing that I was like really not
feeling in the whole oh sorry I actually
missing links it fell on the floor and
so the
again our part of the shape range and
again they are kind of like slinky
trousers so the kind of a similar
material to the flat ones
but they're not as thick which it's kind
of annoying but you know it is what it
is scan it they're black and they're
basically just wider like all the way
down and then they actually split in the
middle of each leg which I just thought
was really different and really cool
it's not really something that I have in
my wardrobe now I'm just for like nights
out to pair with like bodysuit sort of
brawler so like you know bando tops and
stuff like that and it's just a bit
annoying that they're a little bit
thinner but I kind of get that they like
split open and stuff so I don't know but
yeah those were the last thing I think
out of these ones and the flat ones a
hundred percent preferred at the flat
ones they just feel better quality yeah
and I feel like they look a lot better
on my body and so I know who doesn't
recommend those but you know these are
cute as well so that was everything in
this haul I really hope you guys enjoyed
this video I'm gonna shuffle back over
to the middle do you let me know if
you've got any questions about anything
