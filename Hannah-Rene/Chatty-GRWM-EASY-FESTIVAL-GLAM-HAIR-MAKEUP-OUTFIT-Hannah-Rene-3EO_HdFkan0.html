going to be a sort of tutorial and get
ready with me on it this lock here which
is pretty much a kind of like festival
vibe makeup look and I have actually
done a little bit of a hassle as well
it's pretty much this hair here so I
will show you that later on in the video
as well and I do also show you my outfit
as well so it a full get ready with me
the full shebang
I'm so excited as well like honestly so
excited because this video is actually
in collaboration with benefit which if
you guys know me benefit is one of our
favorite brands ever they do some of my
favorite products of all time and I
absolutely love love the people at
benefit they are incredible so I'm so
excited to be working with them on this
video as well as creating this lot with
them I've actually created a bundle with
them as well which is the coolest thing
ever so it actually contains my five
favorite benefit products which don't
mind my thing is I've just finished in
my house I'm use conscious my hands I
have used them all in this look today
it's these three cheap products and it's
who brow products so they are all in my
bundle which is like my fave the bundle
is going to be live on the benefit
website so I will leave a link to it
down below and there is actually which i
think is of course another I have a 20%
up code for you which i think is going
to be hammered 20 I'm not entirely sure
yet but all the information will be in
the top part of the description box
where we just go down there you'll find
it all there with a list of the five
products in at the bundle the link to
where you can find it and purchase it if
you want to purchase it yourself and
also the discount code if you want to
save some money which i think is so cool
to be able to save like a little bit of
money on benefit products so thank you
so much to benefit for letting me have a
little bundle so cool if you want to see
how I created this look as well as how I
got my heart looking like this situation
and what outfit I picked out then just
keep watching
alright okay so I'm going to start with
our today as time them already don't
want me I don't really know what I'm
going to do I kind of have an idea in
mind but I'm like switch it up so I'm
just going to wing it and see how it
goes but the first thing that I'm going
to do is I'm going to take my big makeup
geek Z palette and I have a small video
on this which basically talks through
all the shadows but the color I'm going
to use today first is this sort of like
yellow shade down here in the middle
this is called chickadee and I'm just
going to use that in the crease and I
think I want to do something quite warm
in the crease but then do like a pop of
like blue glitter or like lilac glitter
on the lid soon as I've got a sort of
like blueish top on so we'll see yeah I
don't want to do anything like too crazy
because even though I want it to be like
kind of festival II I kind of want it to
also be like a glum look that you could
wear just like out and about because I
don't know about you what I am NOT going
to any festivals this season no actually
I might yeah you might fella sure so let
me know if he goes any down below
because I always love to know Koko since
I was blending brushes are so scratchy
on my eyes and like ah
I'm going to kind of like just like wing
you out a tiny bit doll doesn't really
look like a lot of minute but like when
you start going with more and more
shadows it kind of builds up right I'll
do what we'll do and then I'm going to
take the next ultimate basics palette
this is the bright when it's got all the
really funky colors in did I just say
funky I don't know I'm going to pick
this sort of like orange shade here and
I want to kind of like just build up
quite a warm but like bright crease kind
of at the same time so hopefully this
will do the trick
just like a wave of feeling really sick
then and I've got that I feel like it's
when I'm quite hot I'm just like well
cool a little pigment I'm taking it like
all the way in as well because um I do
one I think if I'm going to do like a
pigment on the lid sort of thing I'm
going to like do it as like a halo and
put the pigment in the middle don't
neglect her in a corner boys I know and
I'm going to mix together what am I
going to mix together for me I'm going
to mix together the sort of darker
orange the light orange and then like a
little bit of the rise because I want to
get this like a little bit deeper and
it's not quite cutting it for me as a
minute so I'm just going to take that on
like a more tapered blending brush and
let me kind on oh yeah that is was
hoping for don't be afraid like close to
town I'm going you know as well because
like the more dramatic Rosetta I've been
like drag it drag mm-hm
oh yeah oh yeah right and then to the
air corner um let's show you use oh
let's go I should own it oh why not
rusty bro sharpener forgot about this
one
yes I'm going to go in with a sigma
paper
blending brush absolutely love this I
mentioned it in a favorites really good
for just like get any nooks and crannies
I'm just going to pop up the popped up
the air a little bit okay and then in
terms of glitter hmm what do we want to
use so these are brought by makeup Pete
these are the sparklers I've got the
zodiac which is the pebble one and
selfies which is this sort of bully one
mm-hmm
I might mix much the age you know art
I'm going to make them okay so I'll just
put like a little splitter I don't
really want to tip it up but you can
kind of see that just to my colossal is
on each on each side I'm going to take
the next glitter primer I'm going to
hope that this would extend it in the
middle like right there okay so pretty
my gosh that's so cute I love it
bloody love it and what to do next hmm I
feel like it needs like a little bit
more foot in certain on the outer
corners so I might just take I'm going
to take this very dark purple here and
just kind of like what you want to do
with this dog before no you're like it
needs just something a little bit more
though like it's not just looks a bit
black not means in at me I take it on
the blending brush
like bother I don't really know what I'm
doing with it Yanis I want to take away
too much of the rad I think it just
needs a bit there's something wrong well
that's kind of nice I don't like a bit
of pink to it
okay so I'm going to do lashes and stuff
like that I'm going to do that lashes
and things I've camera and then I will
be back to do the skin
okay so eyes are done for the top half I
just put some J makeup lashes on and I
did also just do a little bit of liquid
liner so they blend as well onto the
skin you in Sopron
today I've got like a fresh layer of
fake tan on I'm in my element so I am
going to start with a primer and then
you see Galan law and what is called lot
radiance concentrate it's the cold
primer it's really expensive I'm really
sorry I know it's so annoying so I'm
just gonna blend that onto my skin
Oh
and then for tarnation I'm going to use
a combination that has been used in
quite a lot of the miniatures because I
really like it for some where it's
really long that lasts in so this is the
Becca ultimate coverage complexion cream
in the shade it's tan and then I've also
got the w7 genius feather-light
foundation drops this to audience where
it kind of shows out a little bit and
doesn't make it as thick because this is
like the thickest foundation on the
paradise
so Wow pretty good shade match if I do
say so myself honestly I feel like
mixing foundations is just the best
thing ever it's a little tiny tiny bit
light but don't worry we're going to add
a ton of Brenda virtually applied
so fast as relic is done in like two
seconds right when I go and dump in my
booty blender back at it again okay so
for concealer I'm going to use an oldie
but a goodie this is the Maybelline fit
me this is in the shade 15 so it's like
the paler shade that they do and I'm
just going to pop that under the eyes I
didn't actually remove that red
eyeshadow properly which is probably not
the best thing today but hey ho
and I'm just going to set that with some
powder okay and then for actual powder
I'm just going to go in with Rimmel stay
matte again oldie but a goodie and just
slap the whole face where's my poundage
building like this foundation like it
doesn't need too much satin so like
especially if you like normal to dry
like me okay and then back onto eyes
real quick I'm going to start with brows
because I swear my house just looks so
odd right now what you really need to do
and so notice that was one of my
favorite brow products ever you guys
know I use this 24/7 I've been using it
ever since I tried it out am absolutely
obsessed actually what's converted me to
brow pencils now because if anyone's
been watching my channel for a long time
you'll know that I used to hate no
pencils I just did not understand them
and then this little baby came along so
this is the goof proof brow pencil by
benefit and this is in the shade for
which used to be a little bit too light
for me but it now matches quite well
since I've like dyed my ends lighter and
it comes with a brush at one end which
is a really good brush is really good at
sort of like como products through and
then the actual brow product and it's
quite a thick pencil don't really know
if you're going to be able to see yes
quite a thick pencil and it's got angles
to it it's got like this little slant to
it which is what I like the most because
it really makes feelingly brows so easy
all I do is I literally just start with
the brush side and I do have a full brow
routine where I use this so I'll link it
down below if you want to be like
something super energetic so I'm not
gonna like go really in depth about how
to do my brows today and then I always
start underneath I'm sorry little
Aibileen it's always with like lean your
arm and from when you elbow I always
start underneath with my brow about here
and I just sort of start doing that
section because like for my brows the
most far section is like underneath I
like them to be like quite a straight
line like so as you can see like agents
applies that's what I like about it so
much like it's really quite a creamy
formula it's not like a dry route Hensel
which is what some of my other brow
pencils has been like it's very creamy
so it just sort of applies
really nicely and then at the front you
just want to start like flicking at the
product up so it gives like the actual
illusion of broher yeah of course this
is like the first this brow pencil is
the first thing in my bundle with
benefit when they mentioned that we were
going to be doing a bundle for this
video
I knew it straightaway that this has
been a because this is honestly like my
most used product from them and absolute
little bit especially be like me and you
really struggle with pencils for brows
that you will love it
okay so browser on in terms of the shape
and then one more thing that I always
use as well if April set and my favorite
one is gimme brow by benefit again
college is also in my bundle I knew I
had to have at both guru and the goof
proof and gimme brow because I'm
absolutely obsessed using all the time
so my gimme brow is in the shade of five
it's a little bit darker just because I
feel like it adds a little bit more like
depth and tones to my brow so I'm just
going to pop this in this one's a really
good one as well because it actually
contains fibers so it's really good at
like making your brow hairs look sicker
than they are which we all know I won
but yeah you guys know again absolutely
love this stuff it's also in my priority
I've been using it the longest time now
I just like never switch my brow routine
off anymore anymore okay so browser on
then we've just got to do a little lash
line and finish off the face so I'm not
sure what I want to do a little are
shown I'm going to go back in with the
NYX palette and I'm going to start with
the sort of orange shade again and I'm
just going to mix it with the yellow one
rather than like to get the makeup beat
palette but out so I'm just going to
start blending that and underneath I'm
going to use the same brush that I used
for my inner corner so it's probably got
like a little bit of red left on it
anyway but that doesn't matter because
we're going to put red there as well I'm
going to bring it quite far down as well
like don't feel like you have to but why
not oh yeah I'm going to go in with the
red shade keep that a little bit closer
to the lower lash line sorry and then
I'm going to take a little bit of the
glitter and just sort of I don't know
where to put it but I'm just going to
put it like in the middle again so it
kind of balances with the top I'm not
going to put any glitter glue on because
it should be a little bit left on the
brush
like it doesn't matter too much it
affords amethyst anyway because that's
kind of like this lustreless trend and
then under crazy Marc Jacobs pencil this
is in the shade which is this is in the
shade of fine wine it's like a really
beautiful red and just sort of like
deepen up the waterline okay and then
back on to skin vault frenzy I'm going
to go in with hoola brings it by benefit
again again this is in my bundles
because it's one of my favorite brands
as a long time and I like it because you
can use it for Brandon and contour it's
got quite like a car key base to it so
it's not super long and but it works
really well to like add a lot of
structure to the skin I'm actually going
to use it with like a more structured
contour brush today so this is a sigma
as the names rubbed up on it but it's a
sigma brush it's an angled contour I'm
just going to start with the hollows of
my cheeks
like bum done it burns it so easily it's
ridiculous
I'm going to do Joe alone it's going to
build it up a little bit on the cheeks
because um the foundation at least is a
tiny tiny bit light and obviously you
want to do your little temples but yeah
it is really good at like adding
definition yeah I like to all around my
forehead because I have a five at
collarbone okay and then it for
highlighter I'm going to use the
dandelion twinkle highlighter this is a
powder highlighter by benefit again also
in my bundle you know you know I have to
do a highlight you know so it's the same
package and it's a hula it comes with a
little mini brush as well which will
work just as well
this is what the shade it looks like so
it's a really beautiful kind of like
peachy like baby pink and obviously got
a beautiful Sheen to it as well sorry
I've got like a stock tomorrow's
tomorrow hello so I'm just going to add
this to the tops of the cheekbones wait
until you see it soon
oh hi honestly can we do a obviously
benefit do a lot of highlighters and
stuff they have the liquid ones like
high-beam and whatnot but for me this
one just takes the cake really great and
then all we have left to do for the face
is blusher which is my final product in
my benefit bundle when they release it
and I'm sorry I absolutely fell in love
I do really like benefit blushes in
general rocket or was my favorite and
but this one is California and honestly
is so cement is basically like a sort of
peachy gold I would say which is my idea
of a blush in general that's what it
looks like it also smells like some
cream to me it smells like holiday is so
nice through wasteland through the
hallways don't shout out to sunrays
just as the right amount of warm we have
used three cheap products as you can see
absolute much made in heaven and
obviously the two broad products
match made in heaven as well which is
why I chose those five mobile nail
because just feel like that perfect
together to finish up from Japan use a
remote lip liner in the shade of spice
and then I'm actually going to use my
Kylie cosmetics and k'kaw what are the
lipsticks well one of the liquid
lipsticks this is in the chase Kimberly
I'm not to try these yet so I thought
why not
along the way melodies we haven't played
now I don't wanna read I go in around
these books I think to create a song
quite share did not expect that
mmm-hmm
nice color though okay I think there's
the finished look boys and girls well
example makeup anyway what's going to
add like glitter and my cheekbones but I
feel like because we've got glitter on
the eyes anyway it kind of unnecessary
but you could do the sort of glitter
effect here that if it's say if you are
going to a festival and you want it to
be like super festival glam and you
could do like this little glitter effect
here and just make it really pop in but
I feel that the highlight is doing it by
itself and obviously we've got glitter
on the eyes as it is and I just want to
keep it kind of wearable for like day to
day anyway so this is the finished look
in terms of makeup we now need to do
hair and outfit situation itself or hair
obviously as a minute I got it in a pull
up and I French parted it last night so
what I'm going to do is I'm basically
going to undo my parts and I'll start
with this one actually and we don't
under it but I'm going to keep like the
top section in I think kind of wandering
out like pin it there maybe maybe able
to do a little bit more I'm going to
like vinegar in the net basically I saw
like the last summer and Emily Canham
did a half so I'm pretty sure it is
exactly this like it she had fries flats
in and then Xian Xian did them some side
work and then just sort of clipped the
actual top plat bit like back and it
looks really cute feel like if I just
like back home with a little bit
or should we curl it I don't know it
kind of can tell it looks but has wet
like I basically accentuated it last
night I've dragged out the shower and
it's like really quite wet still so
what's kind of cute that I'll just sort
of like musty look a bit like have rehab
it's fine make it a little bit more
festive Lee soon as we didn't answer
glasses to the cheekbone situation I'm
going to take this color research spray
by L'Oreal this is like the soul of one
day sprays you can just spray them in
and then wash them out so it's in the
shade turquoise and it just like edits
my and scene is not like I'm the blonde
now you look it should work
whoa that's blue I'm going to take the
gray one as well and just sort of like
all the great ones you should really
want to show off as much okay so this is
the hair I do like it but I have to say
I much prefer it tails like if you can
tell it and I can't say because my head
still works and where I wash it last
night in French applied it and if it was
a lot of curled it but it'll just burn
if I do pillars now and well yeah I say
clearly or if you want to have it messy
like this and have it messy but feel
like I was repair it curls and but this
is kind of like and her option I guess
if you are going to a festival and you
want something a little bit more fun and
ba-ba-boom every yeah this is it pretty
much the look I'm now going to show you
my outfit so just an idea of a little
sort of festival look I basically popped
on this top which is what I actually
filmed in it's a Bardot top from
misguided and I've it's a crop top and
because of like the bell sleeves I just
thought it was so appropriate for
festival sorry and because I like the
pattern as well it just looks like
really pretty and as Jack and then I
paired it with a pair of denim shorts
that are also from misguided so I'll
link them both down below if they're
still in stock the belt is just from a
sauce just to keep them nice and high on
the waist and then I just had it with
some timberlands because festivals you
want to be in life and comfy and this is
what your outfit so that is the finished
look with the makeup hat and clothes I
really hope you all love this video yes
