tutorial on this look right here it's
kind of like a chassis get ready with me
because I've basically done a full face
of first impressions because I also
exposed to what you guys wanted I did
like a part with four different options
and this was the most requested
I will just say like I don't know if you
can tell but like in case you can see it
wasn't blinking itself my eye shadow on
this eye is just completely run because
my eyes watering so badly because I
swear I when I wear false eyelashes my
inner corner just hates them like it
always just wants to ROG that you can
really see it though so don't why not
yeah I'm really excited about this video
because there's so many products that
are really wanting to just try on camera
like the first time and it's sort of
like a mix of like drug story stuff all
it more affordable stuff and then
obviously letting more handsome as well
so I really hope you guys like the look
I came up with it like became a lot more
genetic than I intended but you know
here we are I do just want to put the
screen about that and filler is one
scene in this video that might be
distracting to some people because the
foundation that I use in waiting darks
my skin and I know that some people just
get really upset help out you don't like
the fact that our foundation is darker
than my skin sometimes like I didn't
even intend to in this video but I
didn't have a lot of fake tan on and the
foundation that I thought that was
brand-new was for when I'm going out and
when I've got a lot of turn on when I've
heard of spray tanned that's what it was
intended for I don't have a straight on
them right now I'm quite far I used it
anyway because I do like to test
everything out on its own I didn't just
want to mix it with something I go into
this more in the video but you just want
to say I know I'm pretty upset about it
feel free to go through a different
video now that being said I really hope
you guys enjoyed this video give it a
massive thumbs up if you do and yeah
let's go I'm going to go because my god
this eye is not cooperating
okay so we're going to do eyes first
I've already primed them with some soft
ochre by Mac and then the palliate I
feel as I'm half asleep on this let's
mark the palette that I have today is
the morphe at 55 P I have this is like
my third palette by mafia has a Jaclyn
hill one and then I've got the c5 oh and
then I have this one so it's pretty much
oh like purple tones and I'm probably
going to stick with like this half today
because I don't wanna do anything too
bright
and thought it looks promising obviously
like I know I like two other pilots as
well by Murphy song feeling that I'm
going to like this one
and I'm just going to start with like
this one and this one mix it like a
transition color in the crease and then
I feel like I'll just work in and make
this purple in this purple up here like
some of the deeper ones like the Alpha B
and then I might use like a shimmer I
don't really know I'm just gonna go
where they're confusing a two to four by
Mac and just to pop these in I'm always
like where it with water coffee with
morphe eyeshadows because obviously they
are quite fittingly paired um I always
got a lot bit scared somewhat oh don't
apply too much please got this one court
beauty for anyone who's wondering and I
don't know if it's still in stock but
like you can just sign up to the
waitlist and it just as you want and you
are good to go honey nothing better than
just getting a good transition color in
that creases so I got a quite light
drastic like there's this one strip
that's really pale and it's just like
really use this one here and I'm gonna
start does not fit into that outfit be
absolutely a brushes from Sigma so I
feel like I want to I want to give them
a girl look if she was so nice and fresh
I have not had new Sigma brushes in so
long ah the handle just feels so good
all my other ones are so struggle is
brush this brush by Sigma is just like
their ephors people like more precise I
would say so it's an e 28 38 sorry
partner
on the outer corner this is why I have
the camera like so low down because like
when I'm set up but it's wrong but a
single Darleen down into the road it's
just right you see what desert you see
right just a bit the halo I collapse are
just like oh you know I'm doing okay so
this is an e 57 by Sigma it's like a
really small like firm shader brush and
I'm going to take you want the color I'm
going to make this one here which is
like a really nice dragon d and I'm a
slightly dark one and I'm going to do
like a bit of a halo eye so I'm going to
put on the outer portion my and also the
inner portion as well and just hope for
the friggin worth what's that
coolness ready I always like to pack it
on with a shader brush that's usually or
if I'm using a fluffy partially the same
and then I blend out because I feel like
if you just going to go straight in with
a blending brush and it doesn't like pop
the prod it like sort of justice versus
product if you know what I mean like it
doesn't it doesn't give as much
pigmentation I feel like and I'm going
to use an 825 this is just clean and
just start like swimming that out okay
so I probably used like too much
shadolla it's okay I'm going to make it
work so they go back in it with a little
bit of the brown that we used in the
crease
initially I'm just stuffing and then I'm
going to go straight back in with the
e25 and I'm going to take just the
darker one and just because I don't want
to like to build up too much more color
so I don't really need to go back in
with the flat shader first and I'm just
like starting at the lash line and then
blending it up and then yeah just back
in with keep super fluffy brush this is
the Mac 2 to 4 again just discussin all
the edges oh what the hell okay so this
I shadow look like the outside color
that's like the edge of a pan and then
as soon as I swatch it it went like
black I'm like how does that work
I'm going to use the one that into that
because I actually use a little bit more
purple or is that just goes straight up
black I'm just going to use a 240 by Max
we can duct set my favorite brush to
like pack take them in on with this is
10 very dark very quickly isn't it well
start clean away oh crap and I'm just
like keep this quite low today and go
something really just evolving okay I'm
going to go and do all that on this side
and I will be back with you but if I
stay on here my camel guys I think I'm
going to do a wing yeah let's do a wing
so liner I've got the Sigma gel liner in
this
wicked which is just a black gel liner
and a very really build in blue out
there as in Kali in particular like
Holly buna that she really rates this
and then I've also got a new eyeliner
brush from Sigma as well I do usually
use at 65 and this one is the eo6 which
basically looks the same but it looks
like it's got a smaller angle like
they're both angled brushes and but this
one just looks like it's got a smaller
brush head angle you know you know so
I'm literally just going to follow the
angle that we cleaned up with the shadow
da so start in the bottom like so
then you just go and start at the top or
like near the top and just drag it all
the way across
the gel feels like really smooth it
feels really nice I feel like any gel
liner when you first open it is always
good in my experience but like the true
test of a gel liner is what it's like
after a couple of weeks from the pots in
openings obviously when you first open
and you like Korean products like it's
nice and creamy but then I feel like
it's a test as to whether it stays
creamy or whether it just dries out
quite quick because a lot of liners I
have like they're great at first but
then as soon as you start drying out and
nightmare to work with
that is one wing John I'm just going to
do the other one off-camera again you
can't really see it close to the edge of
the so darkening robot you've seen
really wings many a town so for lashes
but a couple and there's actually two
pairs of backseat lashes at the very
kind sent over boxes lashes are like my
favorite brand of more affordable lashes
I would say so the first lot I like in
different packaging as well I think
these are like the more luxurious
suggestions that they do I'm not
entirely sure but they will be listed
down below Beverly Hills are like more
um wispy like a sort of winged shape and
there's also these ones called Rodeo
Drive I believe which are a lot thicker
you like with the look that I've got on
I might try how do Drive and just go all
out if you're someone who likes really
full lashes then definitely go and get a
pair of these because like the bed
fell right I need to show you this
because I'm absolutely going out of my
mind
these look like completely different
lashes like this one has so many more
lashes whereas this one's got like
sections where it's got long greasy ones
and then shorter ones those are sort of
sex like look at this lash girl like I
swear this one is way more sick and like
done can you see that or am I actually
just going insane right and uh clearly
the mantra now and we're going to
reevaluate at the end of the video but
that one is definitely fuller and it's
pondering me okay so for primer ever
needs that girl by benefit which is
described as a brightening face primer
so we're going to give this one a go I'm
not try this before it's painting
it's got like a pink tint to it oh it's
like really pink or we're going to have
you like this because I don't really
like paints hints on my skin oh it's not
like sweets it's not smell like yogurt
like and it looks like yogurt as well oh
okay so I definitely used too much all
mine
Wow definitely used like way too much of
this like always so much of this but you
know that was a learning curve right
that's all foundation I've got two new
ones I've got a nun salvia stick
foundation I'm like a marshmallow hook
this is in the shade Carmelo which I got
for when I've got ton on and like I
really just don't have time right now
I'll pop them like a little bit left
over them on that then I've also got one
by backer this is the ultimate coverage
complexion cream Rachel actually used to
sell me and I really like to finish it
so I got one for myself and this is in
the shade ton as well because I usually
do have it I don't know what's going to
do a fresh coat but clearly not hmm
oh it's really ugly right let's just
quite obviously like too dark before
anyone even gives me in the
comments like I know don't like the
energy first impressions videos I don't
like add in another foundation to light
in it I could easily go go and get a
lighter foundation to like add into this
but then I feel like I can't judge the
formula of this you know it's not too
dry in so far like it still got a nice
bit of luminosity to it but I don't know
if that's the primer underneath and I'm
pretty sure it's like subsidizing
natural finish in the sensor and my
feels like really like not very full I
don't know such as me feel quite
lightweight like it doesn't really feel
like I've got a lot on my face and it
dries really quickly so you have to
blend it out quite fast I would say it's
got like a satin finish it's not really
close to any dry patches as far as I can
see completely canceled out that pink
because it's like so full coverage and I
know the shades too dark but like you
don't need to tell me that there's no
 see where I've got the knob
creamy this is going to be so light come
back to the foundation now yeah I've
never tried this I feel like one of the
only people in issues who's not try this
because I feel like it's so friggin
popular and this is in the shade light
to vanilla so we're going to give it a
go and see how it goes it's really easy
to blend out like it just melts into the
skin and it is really light for what
I've got on but we're just going to work
with it if you look quite sick like it's
not very liquidy um it's not like
creasing too much under the eyes which I
like because I feel like concealer just
creases on me straight away lend it out
really well with the D to learn don't
feel like it just picked up the excess
really nicely so that's the skin so far
another cameras just gone like really
saturated don't mind that for powder I'm
going to use the Rimmel stay matte
because I got like the reason I forgot
the Rita Ora one it's been like
rereleased in different packaging and
select the fifty shades darker
collection just in the shade at zero
zero one at transferring and never
actually use this concealer her on my
face I've never used it but I feel like
everyone raised about it or like
everyone used to rave about it so I'm
just going to pop some on it to set
everything in place I mean I'm only
using a light layer because I don't want
my skin to be like too much today I mean
if this foundation it feels nice because
obviously I love my Make Up For Ever
Ultra HD stick but I do have to set that
quite heavily with powder because
otherwise when I'm blending bronzer on
top it doesn't blend nicely because it's
so jury that it really sticks to it and
clings to it where is this back
foundation it's dried and like I can
feel like it's set in place so I feel
like it doesn't need a lot of power if
that makes sense
so for brows I've got some stuff from
benefit and which I have not tried yet I
don't really know what to use with like
a couple different things so the first
thing that we have got here is the goof
proof brow pencil it comes in packaging
that looks like this this is in the
shade number four it's basically like a
brow pencil I love the packaging a face
like it's so slit
so it's Debra and it's got really nice
like this other side so you basically
get like a brush and to come through
these brows and then you get the actual
pencil which looks like so I'm not a
massive fan of brow pencils I'm not
gonna lie and what we're going to give
it a go and see how it goes
okay I like the formula of it like oh
it's quite pigmented as you can see
there where I've just messed up but it's
just it matches my natural brows
perfectly but it's like not dark enough
for my house and then I was pretty much
black at the minute so I'm going to use
the powder instead edge from Sigma and
I'm going to stage that for our pencil
for when my hairs faded and give it
another go then but I do really like the
formula it like it was quite creamy to
use back in that I couldn't let dawn
when we going for like a bush you
promise to take Jesus Jesus Christ I'm
going to use in fact I'm going to use a
pencil a little bit on this as well
because I did like the formula of that
and I felt like it gave a good base for
the shadows like stick to I'm just doing
like brush like hair strokes rather than
like putting too many sharp lines in
because I don't like when my brows like
I not make sense I don't know
fact I've got a little bit of gimme brow
by benefit and which is like a recession
it won't come out I'm pretty sure it's
like a brown fat like a brow gel it
comes in packages like this and it says
for looking brows matically a pair this
brush on gels and teens tiny microfibers
that enhance the skin and create
fullness pretty much which sounds like
just what I need him on I'm moving on to
lower lash line I'm just gonna go and
get a black eye liner I think because I
think I'm going to put a liner in the
water like honestly I don't wear black
in my waterline a lot because I thought
in a minute I put it in I just look like
a bit okay and then I'm just going to
use the same shadows in the multi
palette so I'm just going to use like a
mix of the brown spread just to buff
that out and then I'll use the petals as
well you can just really like irritate
in my eyes then I'm going to use the
black in the palette and I'm just going
to press that into the lashes and then
blend it down just so that the liner in
the waterline isn't a shark
I'm just going to highlight my inner
corner with nylon by rap just because I
don't want it to get too dark up in the
arm fart bronzer I'm going to give my
Natasha to Nona and blush palette I joke
some naturally use this yet
basically like a blush and bronzer duo I
would say although it's basically it's
just called a blush palette and but I
would tell you this is a bronzer quite
terracotta color like it's very it's
quite ready like orangey toned in my
opinion like definitely more like a warm
Brandon and like a contour shade it
really is I do combo between a blush and
a bronzer by the looks of it it reminds
me quite a lot of giving me Sun by Mac
if anyone else has that this is what
reminds me okay if I highlight that I've
been really excited to try this
so I got this off court beauty it came
up back in stock this is the UH
nostalgic glow kit and like the ultimate
glow while and it just looks like so
I've heard really mixed opinions on this
I know Rachel really likes it I'm pretty
sure she put it in like a yearly
favorites and what I've heard like all
the people just don't because they're
quite chunky by the looks of it like
they've got specks of glycerin and I've
heard like the pigmentation isn't as
great as a rely on so I'm going to try
like I wanted to get it because I love
Anasazi vodka I wanted to like sort of
test it myself and somebody's whites and
I think which is the one at the past and
I'm just going to use the zero fibers
Armbruster always used by Mac I'm just
going to hope for the best
okay I put like up it definitely is like
more chunky than over the highlight like
other and highlighters that I've tried
like it doesn't look as smooth on the
skin what the pigmentation is quite nice
okay sorry yeah you can really see it
for lips I've got one as well I've got a
few of the Beauty bakery lips and like
liquid lip products one of them is and
that one in the shade fortune cookie and
then another one is
in the shade rody pose I think yeah I'm
going to go with them at one stage is
cooler don't want anything too shimmery
and then I might top it off with a glass
this is stripped by knives and again I'm
not a locked Idol these like formula
right so we're just going to give them a
girl I really love the color of that and
I love the feeling in it like it's not
too thick or the drying it just feel
quite tacky down if it doesn't feel very
dry like it feels quite sticky hello it
feels good oh my god that feels so good
although that feels so creamy yeah I
like that so I completely forgot to film
and outside I was just like I was doing
a voiceover and just forgot all about it
so thank you so much for watching I
really hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial this is of course the finished
look thank you so much watching I love
you guys swimming in back and I will see
you in Sunday's video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
