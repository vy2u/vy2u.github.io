honestly not loaded a video in so long
yeah I'm sorry Prince though in my eye
I've not bloated in like two weeks which
is the longest I've ever gone I think on
my channel without loading a video which
makes me really sad and but it's been
for a number of reasons partly because I
am in the process of moving home so I've
been super busy with like decorating my
room at home and just moving things and
buying furniture and just stuff like
that I've also just been like
concentrate in a little bit more on
myself I guess because I feel like for
the past couple months I really just
fell a little bit down and a little bit
not me and I don't really like filming
when I feel like that because I feel
like it really comes across in videos
and stuff and so I'm trying to just like
take it a little bit slower I guess I
feel like once I've moved home I'll be a
lot more myself again because I'll just
be in my natural element my natural
habitat and I'm really excited about it
so I thought I'd film a couple videos
obviously before I go home anyway
because it's in so long and I really do
miss you guys like it's been ages since
I just sat and chatted so I thought I
would do a little chassis get ready with
me and have say I'm not been wearing
makeup at all recently like I have gone
the opposite of makeup I used to wear
every single day and I just don't
anymore I very rarely I wear it like
less than once a week it's so strange I
have a bunch and new products to try
like a ton of new products because a lot
of stuff has arrived in PR which I'm
obviously super super grateful about
yeah I'm sorry if I've not seen myself
like I probably I don't know I still
don't feel and just sent myself at the
minute and I'm sorry if it does come
across in videos because like yeah I
just don't feel like how I usually do I
don't feel like my usual bubbly self and
I don't really know what it is I feel
like it's partly been since I've made
like move into the flat and stuff which
is why I'm moving home and I'm sorry if
it still comes across that way a little
bit I'm just trying to like get back to
me I don't know if I'm making any sense
okay so I'm going to start with
moisturiser I'm just using the sundae
Reilly CEO process and repair
moisturizer I have been loving it I'm
still saving it for food for your
favorite well Lola I'm still saving it
for a favorite video to speak quite
properly about it and it's so good it's
like
it smells of oranges it smells amazing
it's super hydrating and really good if
you've got like normal to dry skin oh my
god I've literally even forgotten how to
apply my question I'm gonna do eyes
today because I'm going to give the silk
culture palette girl I know I'm not
trying it yeah I've had it and had it
very kindly delivered as PR and I'm not
tried it yet but I have seen all the
controversy and all the different
opinions and reviews and tutorials and
stuff using it so I kind of want to give
it my own girl and if I really struggle
with it I will just like to switch over
to the naked heat because I'm going to
film with both and I'm kind of
optimistic I really want it to work
because I do like I do really love a
Nastasia product so this is the palette
brand new out in the packaging Oh - I've
got a little so summon out one person
they usually have like plastic film like
mine's not got one but anyway got a
mirror at the top and then these for the
eyeshadows when I first saw this palette
I wasn't like crazy about it because the
colors aren't really me and but I'm kind
of excited to see because like I feel
like when you look at it overall it's an
interesting combination but you can't
kind of like pick out the ones and stuff
and pair those together so I don't know
we'll give it a go
if you're very soft like they feel quite
similar in my opinion to like the modern
renaissance ones and a lot of people are
commenting about how powdered it powdery
they are but my modern renascence
palette that was like one of the first
things I ever mentioned like when I used
it it was so powdery anyway so I'm not
super fast like if they kick buckle up
because none of the pilot does as well
okay I'm going to start with new ways
and I was going to start with Roxy but
it's quite peachy so I think I'm going
to start with new wave and I'm just
going to use a tiny little bit like this
sort of warm yellow hair I'm just going
to literally like use super light hand
and hope for the best
so yeah I'm just going to pop that in
the crease hmm party it reminds me a lot
of like the color itself reminds me a
lot of tickety if anyone has that by
makeup geek and I could see a video
actually on an Instagram post where
someone like jute all of these colors so
if
you don't like the formula you can get
the same kind of color scheme with like
mingle bouquet shadows and stuff
my gosh oh they are very pigmented like
I've hardly used anything there and I'm
not having any issues with the powder at
all it's literally like what my Modern
Renaissance palette would be like so
that's not a problem so far oh my gosh
so Annabelle comes out this weekend
who's going to see it I'm like such a
little shit when it comes to horror
films like I kind of I won't like I'll
sit in watch them but I'll just look at
the corner of the screen so I'm not
looking directly at what's happening
because I am such a little shit like
I'll just jump to anything and but Kane
really wants to go and see it in the
cinema which I have to say again I don't
really going see Horrors in this ending
running log rather watch them at home
where I'm like heist what comes out as
weekend I'm kind of excited because like
all the animals like well not all the
Annabelle that the conjuring and the
Annabelle's and stuff are always really
good I think so I'm intrigued as to what
that's going to be like okay so so far
that splendid fairly well it looks how
like shadow would usually look for me I
guess yeah so what was it going to tap
out okay so I know I'll come on a couple
people on food asked about um me moving
home I have mentioned this a couple of
times but I feel like not everyone likes
ease it on knows that I'm moving home
because I do get people still asking and
but I am moving home in like six days
huh it's come so quickly so this flat
was just a six month contract for
renting and I did six months because I
was like if I don't like it then I can
move home and if I do like it I was add
another six months on but I've decided
to move how long just because I feel
like I'm not really enjoyed living by
myself um and a lot of stuff has
happened like a lot of stuff has changed
since I've been here like in my life and
it takes me a long time to adjust to
things like change and like big things
that change our gas so I don't know it's
just one of those where I want to get
back to like home and like where I know
I feel comfortable and like being
surrounded by family and stuff because I
thought I'd loved living by myself
because a lot of the time at home might
be by myself anyway because I'm going to
everyone would be like out at school and
work but it's different and
like when everyone comes home in the
evening like I just didn't think about
that and like when I'm here on my own
all day I get so like Oh someone come on
like Cain stays all the time like I
asked him to say all the time because
I'm just like I don't like being on my
own like I've come to realize I just
don't like being by myself so I'm going
to use destiny because I have wanted to
do like a green smokey eye for a while
so I'm going to try to use destiny non
tamed because I'm not really seen too
many people using those and in like
videos I've watched so I'm going to give
this one a go like in the other corner
in the crease and then train like deepen
it up with untamed doing this thing with
these it's just like this so pigmented
it's like really easy to go overboard
I'm just going to do like the standard
shape that I usually do where I kind of
wing it out with the shadow and then
like join it up just hope the mask okay
so I'm looking into things but they're
not the easiest thing to blend once
they've been laid too long and so I'm
going to try and work a little bit
quicker with them which would be strange
if that's the case because that's like
the exact opposite with my modern
release I was like I can put the
eyeshadow down and that's what I love
about it like I can just spend ages like
putting it where I want it and then
blend it out and it just one still
really easily like it doesn't cling I'm
going to go in with a darker one which
is untamed which is this one here like a
forest green it looks really pretty yeah
again very powdery but you know you just
need to literally depends I'm going to
apply on top just do the exact same
motion so literally just still creating
like it's almost like creating a wings
and then filling it in with the
eyeshadow just to like create a car and
then just constantly like going back in
with the blending brush just like much
everything together what I'm doing is
I'm kind of just like patting where I do
just a little eye shadow sweet I just
kind of part it where I want it before I
start blending now
and then go back in with the blending
brush to blend it side though I'm just
going to use the doll corn like I'm not
going to bother with the light on and
I'm just knees that right on the inner
corner to create like a halo I just
because I don't want to do liner today
like I can't be arsed doing a wing like
with liner so I'm going to just try and
make it look a little bit more dramatic
by doing like a halo with the inner
corner instead we've got electric which
is this one and then a door on which is
that line I feel like a dawn is going to
go with the look back I'm gonna knees
are are really not picking up very well
the shimmers I'm not going to lie that
is not I'm going to write with my finger
instead
okay so that applied way better with my
finger than it dipped with the brush
which is it's fine
okay so just cleaned up the under eye
there wasn't starting to fall out
considering I just pack on like a lot of
eyeshadow and and for me like it's
worked fairly well I guess the greens
took a little bit more work I don't
usually wear greens on my eyes very much
and they took a little bit more work for
blowing but in the end like this I feel
like they were all relatively blended
together I'm literally just going to
apply a little bit of black eyeliner to
the lash line pops and washes out and
I'm going to do everything on the other
eye so I'm just going to finish the eyes
off camera okay so I did rushes
off-camera I also did brows only because
I had to reapply this lash because it
may in a corner started watering it was
so annoying it's doing it again and but
I can't be asked taking up and redoing
it basically this inner corner to sell
watery and it takes off all like this
portion of my eyeshadow like it just
completely went to a fight because it
gets so watering it's so annoying so
whenever I can feel it's not happening I
always take my lash off and then redo it
because usually that works but it's
watering again and I can see it taking
off the eyeshadow again and I just can't
even be are taking it off again over
also on the palette like it's no I
didn't find it that bad the eyeshadows
definitely are very powdery I would just
say to use a super light handler there
if it comes down to like what I
recommend buying it or not I personally
like wooden repurchases it just because
the colors aren't like super me anyway
and I just can't see myself reaching for
it on because it is the sort of palette
where you really have to take your time
using it and if you're the sort of
person who likes to just like work out
and I look really quickly then you're
probably not going to like this because
it does take a lot of patience and a lot
of care like you have to be quite
careful with it which I know some people
just like to just kind of like I should
I want to be good to go so this probably
isn't appellate to you if that's you
which for me it kind of is like I just
like to do eyeshadow nice and easy and
quickly and so it's totally not
something that I'm going to reach ton
spot I don't think it's a bad palette
it's worked on my eyes like my eyes look
fine in my opinion unlike there's a
couple of issues with the blending but
overall like I don't have
and crazy issues or anything like that
so if you do like the colors and you
don't mind taking your time with it then
by all means I'd say go and get it
because I do live on the stars of your
products and I feel like it's just the
salt palette yeah well you just really
have to take your time and but if you
like me and you prefer warms and stuff
and I definitely just stick with the
modern Renaissance because I just
that is like my favorite palette of all
time and to be honest like I just don't
feel like this one is as good and I'm
going to move on to skin you sister and
how much time I got on I'm going to get
my twister of the flying saucer I'm
doing a couple of questions as I'm doing
skin because I'm not going to it's
awesome in the air to concentrate on as
much so the primer I'm going to use the
two-faced handle the x-pyr just because
I've got a couple of new a two-phase
products to try today I've got the
newborn this way it's satin parlor and
me and satin fray Sara asked when is
this meetup happenin I don't even know
did I say I was having me up we're
glistening and I don't refer to Serge
that I'm definitely having me over I
must have me and mom are in the midst of
planning some stuff I don't really want
to say too much about it's a minute
because it's kind of like um would not
properly start planning like planning
what we're going to do with stuff it's
kind of like ideas and but it is my
ideas for things like meetups and and
like hand out some things in Manchester
because I feel like in Manchester's
never really like much going on and I
feel like we need to have more going on
and so me and mom are trying to plan
some stuff we have a place a venue if
you like or like a place where we can
have some meetups and things so
hopefully that's going to be happening
like towards the end of the year and
it's something that I'm going to start
planning at once I've got home I'm going
to go for like a meeting with the people
that would help organize it and stuff so
I can't really say too much on it yeah
oh I don't I'm so much used to doing
browser is like this is like don't do
browsers because like the for faith
because it's so difficult to like not
smudge them and we yeah there will be
some hopefully like me out me outside
meetups and hangouts and some more like
like stuff with you guys on my channel
and
I've always wanted to do like a video
with a subscriber like doing makeup and
stuff or I don't know like I've got
loads of ideas up up
I've got loads of ideas but I can't
really just like say too much about a
minute what you will know as soon as it
is like in the work profound Asian I'm
just going to use the Giorgio Armani
power fabric foundation I've really been
liking this I didn't think I will
because it is more like a satin to matte
finish and but some reason like I really
haven't enjoyed it so this is what I'm
going to use on the skin I'm also just
putting something before I pop that on
these are the facade Lee I think I've
taken out there I'm not entirely sure as
the unicorn s is like skin enhancing
drops so I'm going to pop some of these
on I'm not to try these yet and but
they've been in my drawer waiting to be
tested so I'm going to give them a
little girl I like bright pink which is
cool
do you like the drops that everyone uses
on Instagram and I'm just using this
just because the other um power pocket
foundation is a little bit more on the
matte side so I feel like it needs and a
bit more like a hydrating kind of base
Vicki asks have you decided and what
you're doing with your hair are you
going to go back dark I think I am like
I am NOT like I just is being blog back
well you don't mind it but I know it's
not like when I have my black hair and
absolutely loved it so I feel like I'm
going to go even that wasn't black it
was like really dark and I feel like I
will go dark in a couple of weeks but I
want to film a video like before I go
dark and do like a really fun and hair
video where I sort of diet like a
unicorn style and do like different
kinds of I don't colors because
obviously with it being blonde it's a
lot easier to like diet fun colors and
stuff where it's like when it took dark
econ so I think I'm going to do that and
then like diet dark after around my
brows like why this is why I don't do
the first we just don't know how to
handle like doing the foundation
afterwards like I've never been a sort
of person through my brows first but I
feel like everyone else's I'm just like
how do you do this great this is a bonus
weight lose its setting powder and I've
not really seen like too much of this
online like from videos of watching
stuff but I'm excited to try it
a little tap and to keep the powder
locked in that gas okay so this is what
I'm going to use to set my under eye
today it's got tipped it all out it's
got a little bit of a sense where it's
kind of like a yellowy Goldy tone and
for concealer I'm just going to use the
Maybelline fit me again soon as I use
that for prime in the eyes this is just
in the shade 15 so a brush different
comes she asks do you miss school plus
any tips for starting uni and I have to
say like that are sometimes times when I
like miss not really being at school but
miss like um having like the routine is
going to school some reasons like it's
kind of like how I miss going to work
sometimes like I sometimes miss working
at like mask and my Selfridges job just
because and it's kind of like a routine
of having like shifts side my hair is
just like going off and also being
around other people while she working
and washer at school because that's not
something you really do with like things
like YouTube and social media you kind
of do it all by yourself yeah it's kind
of like I don't know I always a little
bit lonely sometimes I guess and I don't
know it's like I sometimes just miss
like getting off and going into work or
going school and like seeing people and
chat in and because it's not really
something that you do in a job like this
like you just work by yourself so that
is what I would say I'm it I'm going to
set that straight wakes its creasing I'm
an intense we'll start and uni like it's
hard for me to give advice on that
because I never went to uni and but like
I did go to school like I went to high
school
I'm College completely by myself without
any funds so if that's like your issue
then honestly like don't worry about
things like meeting new people making
friends because it seems so daunting at
first but um like when you get trans
people here like on your course and
stuff like it will seem a lot less done
in a raccoon and I feel like everyone
enjoys uni like you go out and stuff and
you have fun and translate if you live
in a way or if you live in at home or
whatever but either way like yeah I
guess use like meet new people and stuff
and have a have a good time is anyone at
uni watching this like what Coliseum
because I'm always intrigued to know
like what
people study at unions Johnson if they
enjoy it and because I just couldn't
have seen myself growing teeny because I
was like doing makeup at the time well
obviously like I know a lot of people go
to uni for like different things and
whatnot so let me know it because I
would love to know what everyone else
does the patterns bit annoying because
it's just like I wish it didn't have
that because it's kind of hard to get
powder out and then like back in I'm
just going to set my skin with Mac
mineralize just because it's not like
too much of a heavy powder really it she
knows they're looking like really cakey
today I don't know why you'd like to see
it okay here I don't know if I put too
much foundation on but that's like the
amount I would usually put on so I feel
like it's not that but my forehead
especially it just I feel I guess
because I'm not exfoliating my skin in a
while and but I'm not enjoying it
absolutely for bronzer I'm going to use
a palette by Maybelline this is the
master prize I'm pretty sure I have one
of these open but I can't find it
anywhere so I'm just going to use this
one and I'm going to use the middle
shade here and just as bronzer and then
I'll probably use a little bit of this
to highlight as well it's like a really
nice gold color okay so Elizabeth asked
how you get friends these days I'm so
lonely which is broke my heart because
if there's one thing I hate it's like
the sort of anyone just do them like
alone and stuff because I get that like
I know that feeling and I feel like
making friends online is such a good way
like making friends if you struggle to
in your life like not everyone makes
friends really well at school it's just
because like schools such as it can be
like nothing or is it always is but it
can be like a really difficult
environment and I feel like there's
always like friend groups and like
people can get really like bitchy and
competitive and things like that I'm not
saying everyone's like that but I feel
like some places can be and it can also
just be really hard to like find people
that you completely gel with as well
like people that actually get you and
have like similar interests as you
install a session on Twitter like you
can always tweet people who you know
have similar interests to you so people
who like follow similar people to you
and say if you come across someone who
follows like a lot of youtubers and you
know you have like watching YouTube in
comment
and and I feel like yeah and generally
online is like a really easy way to like
make friends and stuff especially
twister like I go on so friendly onto
the iPhone like not in general but
especially in our family I feel like
everyone's stupid chassis and like
funding on Twitter videos that make up
Trevor for highlighter instead just
because you guys know I love this 2008
one my favorite highlighters ever and so
I'm just going to pop this on the
cheekbones like actually this makes your
skin look all wet like it's so stunning
and honestly my favorite highlighter of
all time like I wish I'd made it I wish
it was my highlighter okay so I'm just
going to finish off the eyes I do not do
I was going to kind of like mirror what
I've done on top and you got underneath
as well but I wanted to try like a
couple of different shades in the
palette just to see and what else works
so I think I'm really trying to do quite
a smoky lash line with the shade which
is Rowdy I'm going to start by just
applying a new wave again though that's
going to be like the color that comes to
swear this down as well so don't be
afraid to like smoke that out and then
I'm going to go on top with Browdy just
going to go straight in with the darker
one and I'm going to use a slightly more
like structured brush and just keep it
like super close well I intended to keep
it super close that was a bit lower than
I hope for this is the Rimmel
scandaleyes black waterproof liner it's
in the shade just black um so really
good drugstore liner like it applies
really well and it stays on really well
as well
we need a tiny bit of all star as well
just for the shits and giggles that also
looks stunning with the yellow like the
new wave I think I'm going to do another
wall can use like just a purples and
like that warm color because that is
strong in like that is way more up my
street in the green you know what I'm
actually really liking this I know that
it's like come together a bit more and
then
blend it out again with this brush these
brushes by the way by buckaroos
beauteous over the first crease brush I
use as well with backstage beauty I'll
link in below so really good oh so soft
and they're pretty inexpensive as well
but these view brushes like I know
lashes are really inexpensive as well
and I do have attempts in cold not to be
a cold person but I do have a 10 percent
code if you want like actually us as
well and for the inner corner I'm not
going to use anything in this little
culture colleges because I don't think
there's anything like super appropriate
and I'm just going to go in with a
little bit of nylon because it's like my
favorite inner corner highlight of all
time honestly my eyeshadows just confuse
the shit out of me because like some of
them like nylon I've done in and then
you have some that just don't have any
pigment like no shade to mark but I was
I used to work there and stuff and it
really just used to bustle me I'm like
how can you create them in like nylon
that's so beautiful and then some of
them just like full so flat and I don't
understand it at all right the lips I
know what I want to use so Rimmel very
kindly from over a bunch of their stay
matte liquid lip colors they've brought
out live liquid lipsticks which is so
exciting because I love em all I think
they were really fab rung up cuz week
cut speak I think they're a really good
afford around and I do usually love like
90% of the products that they bring out
so I'm going to give this a go sorry my
nose is like a really it to you again
and this one is in the shade
lust a it to go it just looks like a
really beautiful brown nude so I'm going
to line my lips and should I line them
with a Rimmel lip line just to like you
know do the full shebang for once in
someone else okay it means the liquid
lipstick I'm so excited try these oh my
gosh this looks like the perfect nude
like my kind of nude yeah understand it
understand it Oh
small nose if the formula ways are very
movie they remind me a lot like they
feel the exact same is the NYX soft
matte lip cream so really like that does
it feel like drying on the lips too much
it dries pretty quickly the color is
stunning so if you're on the hunt for a
good and just or liquid lipstick nude I
would have missed I recommend there so
this is my kind of nude because it's not
like super pinky or anything like that
it's more like on the peachy Brown side
so love this it's going to go over the
top in fact how you disclose this is by
sea I'll say this is in the shade and
it's yeah truth just super villain
always I do prefer like a glossy lip to
them up one like I like put in a liquid
my own just because they last longer and
I do love the finish of like a gloss and
then last but not least I've got set in
spray which as I said a few days to
throw out a new one which I'm really
excited about so love a good second ray
so far and nothing is ever be in my
urban decay a chair like it's my
favorite all-time nothing's ever really
come closer it's running it's like I do
like a lot of other x rays so it looks
like super patchy and this is the hunger
but x3 and one replenishing primer oh
it's a primer under setting spray and
silicone free alcohol-free oil free with
coconut water probiotic based
ingredients and skin revisers I'm just
going to do the deeds
okay let's let it dry mMmmm
that justice pears like a lot of big
drops like let it dry my instant
impression when I look to number them
was like holy fuck that I just
completely sucked at my makeup but it
turned out it's okay
but it has a left a lot of dots on my
skin because the dispenser like and just
like squirt it out a lot of large like
drops rather than like a full mist so
it's not going to completely open okay
okay I don't know we'll see we'll see
how my makeup actually lasts now that
it's like sad because this one's
finished look I'm going to go off and do
like my hair and stuff off-camera and
I'll probably just take a pictures of
thumbnail because it's going to take me
a hot minute to get changed and do my
hair and stuff so this is the finished
makeup look and I really hope you all

their other side like I'm really sorry
for the sort of like inconsistency with
uploads lately like I've just not been
completely on it and I promise like
everything will get back to normal soon
some home but six days it's like six
days until you high at the moving van
and take everything home and then it's
about four days after that what I've got
I like clean the flat and then give my
keys back so I'm really excited like
honestly so excited because it's just
mean time for things like autumn and
Christmas as well and my room is having
