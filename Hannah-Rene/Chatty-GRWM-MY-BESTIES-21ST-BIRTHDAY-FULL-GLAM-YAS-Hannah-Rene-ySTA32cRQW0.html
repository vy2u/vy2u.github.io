with me and makeup tutorial on this look
right here it's probably my favorite
look that I've done in forever and ever
and ever and today's video is really
special as well because it's actually
Island's 21st birthday party tonight I'm
so excited
hence the full face of glam I did my
hair and stuff as well I did do it off
camera which I explained in detail more
in the video but this is the hat that
I've come up with and I followed Carli
bybel shoot Oreo so I'll leave a link
down below yeah basically the whole
theme of the party is it's gonna be like
really really glam like black-tie ball
gowns and things like that and so I've
got a really lovely dress from an Indian
marabi to wear as well which I'm so
excited I'll leave a link to the dress
address I'll leave a link to the dress
and all the makeup and everything like
that down below so literally everything
in this look will be in the description
bar
I'm so excited like I'm honestly in love
with it no name but yeah I'm really
excited the island tonight she's gonna
look so gorgeous I already know it's not
her birthday for a couple of weeks yeah
but the party is like a kind of joint
party with a mom as well which I thought
it was so cool and yeah this is pretty
much - looks like a clock with so it's
just like super glam lots of glitter and
nude lip standard onyx Renee you know
the deal I'm gonna see how I achieve
this look and have a chat with me and
things like that then just get out
everything's in pink girls at the veneer
looks so crazy I've done a little bit of
my brows off-camera I've not done the
very inner portion cuz I'm gonna do that
when I've got Foundation and stuff on
and but I kind of just wanted my arch in
place just so that because I'm doing
quite a dramatic eye I just wanted to
kind of have a barrier for where like
the shadow needs to be and stuff and
I've primed my lips and stuff like that
the palette that I'm gonna be using is
the morphe 25a and bc way very kindly
something's over this morning and I've
been dying to try them so I'm really
excited to give this a go I think I'm
just gonna go in that's a bit of shimmer
right now actually oh I don't know
there's so many colors to choose from
I'm like who think I'm just gonna go in
a little bit of this line and then mix
it in with this one down here they don't
have names or anything like that so much
as just using this one and this one
brush that I'm using for now is a map -
too far I decided to sit in front of my
bed today which I don't usually do for
tutorials um but I know some of you
prefer this backdrop - like that or the
one you like some of you think it's too
busy the one with like my acrylic
storage and stuff which is fair enough
because I think it's a little bit
intense as well now but the only thing
would like sitting in front of my badge
is like it's quite hard for me to SAP
studio lights up behind NICs there's
just not enough depth between like my
bed in the wall
I think this brush has a bit of like
excess product on and that's why it's
going on so dark yeah okay so this brush
definitely has product I hate my life
bringing this all the way in as well
because we're going for drama llama
today so I don't know what this brush
has on it but I mean let's be honest top
color is not that dark when you use my
backstage beauty brush instead just
because I'm pretty sure this one's a bit
cleaner I'm so bad like half my brushes
it is filthy as I've said in the past as
well backstage beauty brush is so soft
they actually feel a lot nicer done muck
brushes and then yeah I'm just gonna
layer it a little bit with this shadow
here even though whatever I've just put
my house is probably darker anyway yeah
so this eyelids at 21st she's not
actually 21 yet it's a birthday on the
21st of October but it's like a party in
celebration with her mom's 50th as well
so it should be a good night they're
just gonna dip into this color here and
mix it a little bit with that one I just
really like building up transition
colors and like crease colors and stuff
I feel like in the end it gives you like
a really nice finished look me
let's get the out of me mom
Oh God okay so I'm gonna use this shade
here which is kind of like the warmest
out the darkest ones I would say it's
kind of like a ready like terracotta
shade I'm just going to use this on a
Mac two one seven I'm going to do a wing
today as well so I'm not gonna like
worry too much about making a mess here
and then I'm just gonna start blending
it out these shadows are blending really
nice and just like applying really nice
in general multi eye shadows are always
pretty good like I've never really had
massive issues with them also guys what
you watching this um what Halloween
looks do you want to see if you want to
see any so I asked on Twitter and some
people asked for like a glum like makeup
only look so I'm probably gonna upload
that this week where it's literally just
gonna be like it's not gonna be like
Halloween makeup it's just gonna be glam
makeup but like dark and smoky yeah let
me know because I don't know like what
scary ones G this year Halloween gets
harder and harder each year because some
people are just so good at and I'm like
not one of those people who like I'm
okay special effects toughen things but
like literally just okay like it's not
something that I'm like the best art so
when it gets this time of year I'm just
like oh my god so many people are doing
like amazing things and I just can't
live up to it okay I'm gonna go in with
a mix of this shade here which is like
slightly darker than this one that was
just used on this shade here I'm just
gonna use this to deepen everything oh
yeah these are blending really nice my
teeth really hurt and I don't know why
and then I'm just going back in with the
backstage beauty brush kind of just to
match everything together and diffuse
everything this hasn't got like any
additional product John and then I'm
just gonna go in with a tiny bit of the
black because I think what I'm gonna do
rather than do like a proper winged
liner is just apply this right down here
and then kind of just like when I clean
it up it'll look some mess at the minute
I know it does but when you clean it up
it'll look a lot sharper this camera's
really struggling with like focus don't
use too much which is why I'm putting
the majority down here
we clean it up it'll look really pretty
I promise okay so this is what we can
like this is the finished look so I'm
just gonna take a wipe and start
cleaning this away which is when the
magic is gonna happen hate your time
when you do this as well because like if
you do if you do it too high you
literally just yourself over I
always leave like a little bit
underneath so I don't clean up right
from the outer corner because when you
come to do lower like lush eyeshadow
then it'll like join up rather than it
kind of go out and then start does that
make sense I don't if I'm a censor what
I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna go in
with some concealer so I'm just gonna
use NARS radiant which is what I used as
at my base and I'm just gonna use this
to cut the crease a little bit I'm just
gonna literally pop this on the back of
my home so I'm not put any fake Tunya on
so I'm gonna do that when I finished the
eyes and I move on to skin and I'm just
using at the minute a Mac to to a just
gonna map out kind of like wow I want
the cut crease to be
he's gonna use really like small
movements to this
so for glitter I'm just going to use
muck reflex Bruns which is this one here
I'm just going to also mix in reflex
pearl and which is in limited edition
packaging but you can buy buy it normal
and then I'm gonna take two-faced
glitter glue and I'm just gonna pop that
on top of the concealer and I'm just
gonna go in with the glitter
okay so both eyes are done I'm
absolutely loving them so far
I'm two lashes I'm gonna do is apply
some falsies from Lily lashes again
these were very kindly sent over from
Beauty bait this morning and I love the
look of them because they're actually
faux mink first of all which I really
want to start using faux mink lashes
because I know it's so hard cause like
my jade makeup lashes I like my favorite
ever but they're obviously like 3d mink
or whatever and it's just not it's not
good to use them so is it in the style
at Dallara and the art faux mink that's
what they look like they're so they're
kind of a similar shape to the J makeup
ones and they're just a little bit more
spiky so I'm gonna pop those on I don't
know why this like Canon atj it's just
being a little bitch and not focusing
and then it was I'm doing that
off-camera so I'm basically just gonna
finish my lashes and stuff I'm gonna put
some instants hand on my body as well
because we're gonna because I'm wearing
like a long dress there's no need for me
to do like full-blown full body tan last
night because all its gonna be showing
it's like my shoulders it's long sleeve
as well and the turn the tan that I'm
gonna be using is the Rimmel Sun shimmer
instant tan in dark it's the matte one
as well so I'm just going to pop that on
with a San Tropez tan omit so I'm gonna
do all that off-camera and then I'll be
back in a minute okay so I popped the
instance hang on as you can see and I've
applied the lashes so this is what they
look like so I'm to skin these little
curls oh my gosh I can't wait to take
mom I'm just gonna use the Smashbox
primer water just because I've really
been enjoying this recently so I never
need to be careful with this cuz like I
can't get water like near my tongues it
washes off foundation I'm gonna use the
Giorgio Armani power fabric foundation
this is in the shade six you guys know I
love love love love love this stuff and
I'm sorry that I use it like 24/7
although to be fair for the past two
videos I'm not use it so it's not that
bad but it's like my go-to at the minute
and I just want to make sure that I'm
using something that I know it's gonna
give me a good finish and like lasts
gonna start blending it in I'm just
using a backstage Beauty foundation
brush I need a little bit lighter than
the tan Wow that never happens to me
okay so I'm just taking my uh Nastasia
Beverly Hills cream contour kit this is
in the fair shade I'm just gonna use the
shade mink which is the darkest one just
to hopefully try and like balances color
a little bit better because these are a
bit cooler so I'm hoping it's gonna
match the town a bit better because like
this tans a little bit too yellow for
the I mean the foundations are bits here
yellow for the ton and I can't seem to
fix it and so hopefully this should do
the job and then a bit of bronzer later
and that should hopefully just like
solve all my problems but concealer I'm
just gonna go back in with NARS radiant
creamy it pisses me off that nas now
sell in China like what is the need in
that like that's just taking steps
backward I don't say don't understand
why they've done that okay so I'm just
buffing that oh I really want to try it
heart shape tape because I know tops
cruelty free if I actually feel like the
last present on the planet as well to
like try heart shape tape I'm just
setting the rest of the skin with that
same powder and I've been using it to
Faced Born This Way a lot recently
like I actually really do like it right
whilst a little friend has got the law
again and I'm just gonna finish off the
brow so I'm just doing the very
intersection with dipbrow which is what
I used to start with okay I think we
should finish lower lash line and then
do the rest of the skin so I'm back into
the morphe 25a I'm just gonna mimic
everything that we did on the like in
the crease on the lower lash line so I'm
gonna use like the lighter shades here
first and diffuse those at the most down
and then I'm just going to go into the
slightly darker ones as well and the
rush that I'm going to use for this is a
backstage beauty brush again it's one of
the more tapered blending brushes
absolutely love this for lower lashline
because it's really soft and it really
diffuses the product quite well I'm just
gonna go into the very darker ones which
for these two hair and just place those
right at the lashes so I'm being a lot
smaller with this movement I'm using the
same brush just because it's got all the
colors on so it really helps to like
blend but I'm just making sure that when
I blend it out I'm not like taking it
down or anything like
and I'm literally keeping it right where
my lashes are is the Makeup Forever aqua
excel in m60 and then you just want to
put some mascara on a little lashes it
can be any mascara you want I'm using
Maybelline Big Shot really important
when we're doing such a dramatic look to
do mascara on the little lashes because
it honestly just makes like so much
difference like it balances out with you
false ones if you're not wearing false
eyelashes it doesn't matter as much I
don't think but if you've got like quite
intense lashes on like I have you really
need like the balance but in a corner
this camera needs to get it together
honestly I feel like I don't even have
to say what I'm gonna use try and guess
right now while you're watching this
those of you who follow me like all the
time will know this is nylon it by Mac
it's pretty much all I use to highlight
or department say it there is as I
mentioned in a video the other day the
brush that I use is in a Nastasia it's
like the jewel anyone that you get in
most poly X sorry I've got really bad
hiccups I just like to use the fluffy
side and I literally like swell round
tap off the excess cuz nylon is like so
pigmented like for a muck shadow and
then I just literally pop him right
there and like it really really comes
through and I just use excess on the
brow bone so don't like too much of a
highlight brow bone and if I'm honest I
don't like it to look super shimmery
okay maybe I'm back on the face I'm
actually loving this look like I'm
obsessed not to sound like a broken
record but I'm gonna use the makeup
feather and pro bronze fusion you guys
know I am obsessed with this again and
like I set a foundation because this is
for a party I want to make sure that I'm
using something that I know will last
and look really nice so this is the
shade 25 I of cinnamon the brush that
I'm using is a mac 135 I got so many
questions on this brush it's like so
good for bronzer I like about this run's
resolves it's not not like it look smart
in the pan and it's kind of matte but as
you can see like it has the tiniest
little bit of like shine to it which is
why it ends in an eye because I'm pretty
sure it stands for like iridescent and
because you can get some that ending
and then ma but it doesn't come up matte
on the skin it just gives you like a
really healthy glow and for highlighter
again absolute broken record I'm going
to use the makeup Robert pro light
fusion in the shade - if I can open it I
mean how can you not look at it how can
you not honestly he's two of my favorite
cheap products of all time they just
never let me down so I picked a lip
combo out earlier because I knew that I
wanted to have like a super pale nude
lip just because I want all the
attention on the eyes so the lip liner
that I'm going to use is the Makeup
Forever aqua lip in the shade 1c it's
just like a really nice kind of nudie
peach color and then I'm gonna go in
with one of the L'Oreal in collaboration
with balm on and it's in the shade urban
Safari it's like a really gorgeous like
really pale nude and then for gloss I
have another product that beautybay very
kindly sent over it's one of the dose of
colors lip glosses and I wanted to try
this because I've never tried any dose
of colors lip products for everyone
brace about them and it's in the shade
undressed so I'm just gonna do that now
I am obsessed how many times have I said
obsessed in this video but oh my God
look at this nude like this is like my
perfect nude so guys this is the
finished look which kind of just say I'm
obsessed where I love it so much but I
am obsessed
I just cannot like nothing beats glumly
that's just like smoky gold neutral nude
lip like it is just the one it's the one
but yeah I really hope you all enjoyed
this tutorial I'm gonna insert a couple
of clips of like my dress and the full
shebang finished look as well just that
