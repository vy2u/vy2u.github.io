so same video is going to be a makeup
tutorial slash get ready with me on this
makeup look right here really wanted to
just sit down and do my like idea of the
perfect summer makeup ever which I feel
like this is it's just everything I
could ever want in a look it's glowy
but long-lasting I made sure that I sort
of like smokes very lots of products
that are really long-lasting to me so
that it's like summer proof and sweat
proof and everything proof will see that
I really hope you like the look that I
came up with if you have any other
requests small looks that you're going
to do or videos that you want to do in
general then let me know down below but
if you want to see how I achieve this
look and how I create this sort of like
long-lasting but glowy makeup look then
just keep watching hey hey okay so I've
had like French parts in for ages and I
basically from a video this morning and
I put blue my hair and it's all very
sticky and it keeps getting on my skin
so I basically put my hair out so long
story short starts my hazmat so I'm
going to do in like a super ultimate
glowy glam summer makeup like I just
want to do one she's hurry all that is
warm glowy
sparkly glossy nude all the things that
I live in life that is what I wanted to
do today so they also obviously wanted
to be like really long-lasting as well
so really good like summer times like
sweat proof in my opinion with my skin
type anyway and so we are going to start
with eyes I have primed them with a
little bit concealer I just use NARS
radiant creamy and just a good soft
ochre and was driver for me and I've
given up on it oh so I'm going to start
with these Tuesday's sweet peach palette
because Jordan was doing this on holiday
in Ibiza and I've forgotten how much I
loved it and then I saw how using it I'm
here I'm a carbonyl to say not as much
no I gotta walk it back out other wing
I'm basically going to start by mixing
caramelise which is just sort of that
alive guys are going to start with
candied peach which is like this really
pale and pastel peach and I'm gonna mix
it was puree which is this kind of work
sticky Brown then no jokes I like today
has been the first time I've basically
filmed few videos today and they've
broken like makeup videos and the first
time that I've sat down in this room in
over a month and actually like filmed
like a proper get ready with me
to come around because like I just
couldn't bring myself to zero after me
and Ellie and so to get ready with us
before the ariana concert which I was
thinking about in a Q&amp;amp;A be other day and
and it feels like so good to sit here
now I feel like now I'm actually stuck
here and I've just done it like it just
feels so nice so I'm gonna really cook
me today
it's basically what I'm trying to say
not used toothpaste eyeshadows in a
really long time and I forgot like how
easily they blend so yeah I do want this
to be like winged out and like smoky so
I'm just going to like start building it
that outer corner as I always do and I
try to keep it neat these days because I
don't really like to clean it with
concealer I like to keep it smoked out I
feel like it looks I mean I think it
just looks better like when it's not a
sharp line like I don't know that she's
like my personal preference so I try and
be a bit neater these days because
obviously I used to just like walk on a
shadow and then it wouldn't really
matter if I like brought it down here
cuz I clean it off okay so I'm going to
start going in with some iyong which is
this shade here it's like a kind of
beautiful terracotta like a rich brown
and I don't brush to take it on I'm
going to take it on a 2-1 7 by mark
which is day it's dirty exhibit this
morning she's got the admit cry shadow
on it from there like bright color
palette but it's fine because it's like
read some stuff anyone and yeah I'm just
going to do like my standard my son did
blend out when I keep going back in with
the blending brush just to make sure
there's no like harsh lines okay so I
basically like draw the line and then I
kind of just start connecting it's like
if you were to do a wings we thought
like a winged liner which is annoying
because you have to be like a lot softer
with the Red Menace which I've never
been like a such a light handed person
with makeup I just like like that I'm so
excited to watch Leviathan lay out
obviously this won't go up I'm like
whatever bit rock - and what it looks
like it's all about to kick off like
gonna be DxO like I started to use
before and basically all the couples
have to vote for a couple to go out like
whoever those things it's at least
compatible and there was like a bit in
doing about like how Johnny
like just has no interesting Camilla and
I was like what
that has no such an angel she's like one
of those people who just want to be
friends oh because you just know she'd
be the bestest friend never I'm gonna
dip into at my Mac blush palette which
oh so pretty
I'm going to mix these chips we've got
apple red whip non apple red sari and
then Popeye which is this one here I'm
going to mix these together nothing I
love more than just like layering
eyeshadows like oh so I'm just doing
that the same technique I'm just like
dragging it out you can see like the
line and then I just go back in and
start like blending it together so you
kind of want to create like a triangle
on the outer corner of your eye
I'm sorry but don't mark blushes just
make the most gorgeous red eye shadows
you've ever seen in your life
I'll just mix cabin fever and Americana
which is up here any sort of like warm
Browns will do don't feel like you have
to use the same ones as much as I do the
exact same set great and then I'm going
to take my Sigma tapered blending brush
one of my favorite brushes for like
right in the Internet and literally
you're just going to mix all the same
shades together so I'm starting with
this sort of like red and I'm just going
to pop that on the inner corner like so
Oh give it to me and then I'm going to
add in the sort of like darker shades as
well of course basically just like much
in what the other part is for glitter
where are they so I picked out three
because I was like I'm going to do this
I'm going to go all our hot but don't
feel like you have to use three you can
use like any of these by themselves and
I have to burn marks which are red which
is this one just like red glitter reflex
bronze and then stargazer and sparkle of
eye makeup because I'm just going to
whack a bit of glitter glue
Oh God deal okay so that is like the
best thing about this in my whole life
I'm literally just going to go ahead and
clean up my undereyes whack on the tiny
bit of liquid liner and then pop on some
lushes and just finish off sighs I'm
just going to do a camera and the lashes
that I'll use RJ makeup style early
lashes and no using tiny balls I'm sorry
and but I love them and yeah I'll be
back in a minute
so because I want to make sure I'm kind
of doing this as like as something
that's appropriate for summer that I
think is going to last all day that last
to me personally I'm going to let you
hear everything like all the products I
like to use when I want when they come
to be sweat-proof
on Polly just like yeah long-lasting and
pattern all day and I have already
moisturized because I'm not a I have to
moisturize no matter what and but the
primer that I'm going to go in with is
the Galan law um what is this called I
never know law radiance concentrate and
this time I it's so expensive and I hate
using it on camera because I know it's
annoying one put up super expensive and
but it is really good so if you are in
the market for a high-end primer and
your normal to dry like me I don't know
how this would work on oily skin to be
honest because it's kind of like the
best way I describe it is it's like
water jelly it's very hydrating but your
skin doesn't just like suck it off of it
stays hydrating which I really like so
I'm loving it at the minute and soon as
I'm invested in it I am using it so I'm
just applying it all over the skin and
I'm going to use a second kind of like
priming product in a minute
but I only use that in certain areas I
always put this all over but then I like
to sort of double prime in some areas
like summer time so as a second primer
I'm going to use the body shop in some
art which is a kind of like
multi-purpose products you don't have to
use it for primer but it can be used on
the skin and stuff to help sort of like
modify certain areas that wherever you
apply it and you can also use it for
things like lipsticks and like lip
products as well if you want to use it
to that so it's kind of like a good
all-rounder to have as I said though I'm
just needed on certain parts of the skin
because even though I am kind of like
dry to normal and normal to dry in
summer time obviously with it being
really hot applied occasionally in the
UK and I do have certain areas where my
makeup likes just to run off my face so
I'm going to apply it mostly in areas
that are my keys
I don't really have issues on like my to
2010 but particularly like around my
nostrils a little bit like around my
smile eyes and on my chin and stuff tiny
bit on the nose particularly like this
area and then a tiny bit on the forehead
as well just helps to keep everything
again on all day flat proof long-lasting
you know the drill nostrils nostrils for
me is just like it needs to be done and
then I'm just going to like blend that
in with like a little muck split fibre
brush which is life sometimes you can
find that anyway well yeah I get any
shine I like job one shine it's usually
like my nose area a little bit on my
chin and stuff and like around my mouth
you're like we've all been there with a
sweaty upper lip she's a little sewer
no thank you and then it's for
foundation I'm going to mix where's it
gone I'm going to mix the exact ultimate
coverage complexion cream with the w7 it
genius feather-light foundation this is
amazing for sort of oily skin I would
say it's very massive not much it's like
not super matte but it is multiplying in
my opinion and so I don't like to use it
I can put it on it so and I basically
mix it in to give it a bit more of like
a liquidy consistency so it just works
and blends but on my face and I'm just
going to start applying that all over
the skin honest like the w7 drops really
make a difference to foundation because
otherwise it's just like sick like well
tiny bit like I'm aware don't worry
we'll just brings it off but we fine I
think like going over a lot with a
Beauty Blender recently I don't tend to
do that sorry I'm like way afternoon and
but again especially summertime like
this is so full coverage anyway like I
don't want excess on if you know what I
mean like I just want what I need on and
nothing more so there's pretty much just
goes over blends
any excess out and just yet absorbs like
any access as well but concealer I'm
just going to use NARS radiant creamy
just because it's what I prime my eyes
with I mean what's out on the desk and
this is in the shade vanilla I believe
yeah and then yet you just want to like
blend out NARS radiant creamy one of my
favorite concealers like especially for
summer as well because it doesn't crease
on
it's really good for not creasing and it
genuinely set some please and does not
leave like it's so good like a lot
concealers I have to powder down
straightaway whereas this like it
doesn't matter too much I could sit here
and do all this jobs and like I don't
know it'd be fine so I'd leave them had
it again really good for summertime if
you're more oily skin and feel free to
like set your whole face of that and but
because I'm not done because the
foundation is relatively like matte in
some areas anyways because of the
instrument I'm just going to set it with
Mac mineralize skinfinish which is a
more like hydrating powder I would say
like it's more for normal to dry skin
I'm just going to lightly set in the
areas so where I use the instrument
because a researcher doesn't really need
a lot of Pardoner or use kind of like
Martin duck down to finish it off their
eyes what am I going to use okay I'm
going to use the Mac just like the same
marks blushes that I use and just blend
those underneath towards my little
blending brush gone with my old friend
gone up to you how have you do this that
was heavier than I anticipated it was
going to be what we're gonna have to
work with it now I'm going to take nylon
eyeshadow by Mac one of my favorite
eyeshadows of all time absolutely adore
this I'm going to highlight my inner
corner with this off I love that so much
um just lined in it really is really
when we've got a locally squirrel mom we
want a blending in a corner so if we're
doing a looks like a super long lasting
and sweat proof and God knows what else
I'm going to use the makeup fiber Pro a
transfusion which I know I use a lot but
the reason I'm using it today especially
is because it's actually waterproof so
if you really really won that waterproof
stay all day
Mikal blog for me this is just an
essential because it generally is
waterproof I'm listed in the shade at 25
I I always get questions on it and I
always forget to listed in the
description box I'm sorry it's in 25 I
cinnamon so it's the area is one of the
arid effing ones which if you can see
like it has a slight sheen to it which I
love because it just means it blends so
well on the skin like it's not dry it's
very silky it's is that when you swatch
it not a lot not a lot like swatches on
the finger but it just feels really
really lovely and soft and silky so it's
amazing a bronzer now I'm just going to
take a bronzing brush and just start
applying this to the cheeks
obviously it's a really lovely warm core
as well so perfect for summer
Oh
Oh
and then for highlighter I thought to
use today well seeing as I'm doing this
is like what I would do for like a
long-lasting look I'm just going to use
makeup forever again pro light fusion so
it's pretty much like the same product
but this is the highlighter and the
programs like this to the bronzer and
this isn't waterproof or anything like
that but I find it so long-lasting like
some highlight is I love when I first
apply them but I look in the mirror
later in the day and they're just gone
I'm like hello where is the glove but
this less really well and it just
because it's just like a makeup artists
formula it's incredible absolutely love
it so you know watch this on chi-chi's
it's a really beautiful gold color as
well as you can see so it's going to tie
really well with the eyes
can we just it makes your skin look wet
which for me is quite important when
we've used like such a sort of like
master find ease but it is more matte
than I would usually go for and
certainly it's like important to bring
the glow back in with a bit of
highlighter so I still look nice and
cheery and wet okay and then default
lips I'm going to start with Rimmel lip
liner in spice one of my favorite lip
liners ever absolutely love the formula
it's just incredible so I'm just going
to quickly line my lips with this
and then looks like I'm going to use the
body shop match the liquid lipstick in
the shade creat as I said it is matte so
again really long-lasting on the lips
I feel like liquid lipstick should last
really well on me anyway so again
perfect for summer and a whole day
makeup look if you did want to use a
lipstick instead of a liquid lipstick
because you just preferred the formula
of a lipstick then you could always use
it in summer again just like mattify it
and keep it on for longer
you smell shells as well it just smell
it summer is smell trophical oh nice on
hand actually much is the Rimmel lip
liner basically perfectly okay and then
finish up I'm going to use a glass just
because I love a glossy lip and if you
like with all the glow going on I feel
like it's only appropriate so I'm just
using it the sea art a lip gloss in the
shade it trusts just going to pop that
on top it's pretty much like a click
Lawson area so it doesn't really add
like too much color and then it's a
finish off this whole look and to make
it even more long-lasting I'm just going
to go in with a setting spray so this is
by the body shop and again it's just the
makeup setting spray and I'm just no
spray this all over my face and it's
going to help everything it lasts even
longer oh actually love like the actual
dispenser for the mist of art it really
disperses it all over your face like
really well so this is the finished look
