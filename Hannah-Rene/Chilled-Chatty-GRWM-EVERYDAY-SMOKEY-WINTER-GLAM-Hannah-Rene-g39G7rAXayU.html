hey guys it's Han so today's video is a
chatty get ready with me on this makeup
look right here
I love fell in these videos and a lot of
you asked us on Twitter so I thought I
would sit down do my makeup have a chat
with you as if you are sat in this room
with me because that's like my favorite
thing to do and I did need to get my
makeup done State anyway because I'm
actually off to London for the day so
this is the look that came up with I
knew that I wanted to do something that
was sort of like everyday I say every
day it's like everyday smoky glam
obviously for me I don't go to school or
college or anything like that anymore so
I can be as long as I want all day every
day so I wanted to do something quite
smoky on the eyes but was still like no
liner so it's still kind of daytime ish
and just put a nude lip with it so all
the attentions on the eyes but yeah I
wanted to do like a black like smoky
little lash line and just really sort of
like smoke it out and blow it out um and
yeah this is what I came up with I
really hope you like it so without me
instead I'm just going to get straight
on it with the video so if you want to
see how i got this makeup look and sit
and chat and get ready with me then it
just keep watching I literally feel like
I'm still asleep I'm so excited
yeah also my hands look really dark I
don't know why promise it won't look
that dark
I swear look how much she just picked up
everything also currently drinking 3
drinks I've got a cup of tea which has
three singers and milk almond milk if
you want to know I've got a big thing of
was that I always have to have a massive
thing Awards with me because I drink
like a friggin plan and then I've also
got a protein shake because this is my
breakfast so could I get any more high
maintenance
probably not oh my god I had a dream
last night I had a nightmare basically
and it's not neither I have this like
thing where every Christmas Eve I have
to watch home alone like before I go to
sleep so just before I go sleep I
watched the first in the second home
alone it's like something I have to do
my favorite my favorite film ever I had
a dream last night that I woke up on
Christmas morning and forgotten to watch
home alone
in the crowd it's awful I was like so
dramatic let me go I'm dump this
Beautyblender back in it again so I'm
going to start with skin today because
I'm not doing a winged liner so I don't
feel the need to do my eyes um first I
swear to God I am NOT alive right now
for primer I'm going to use the Too
Faced hangover X today I've not used
that in a while and I'm going to mix in
a little bit of the true much like
hydrating drops these are like liquid
illuminators and this is the golden and
the austere pink one
I'm not tried this yet so this should be
interesting you can kind of see there
boom oh wow that's slowly okay then
fulfill nation I'm going to use and the
makeup privilege HD stick just because
it's my favorite I don't feel like
making my life easy today I'm not using
something that's not my favorite what's
that wrong favorite Christmas song my
favorite Christmas song like ever is
baby it's cold outside I don't know why
I just love it like I love the little
story long like that goes along with it
and like the lyrics and stuff I don't
know I just love it but my favorite
Christmas album is it Michael Buble and
it makes me really sad that his son is
ill because no one should have to deal
with like illness at that age it's just
heartbreaking really
Mini's a little bit of the darker one
just because it's a bit warmer and just
like on areas around my skin using the
Real Techniques expert face brush if
anyone's wondering this is like my
favorite brush of all time foundation um
I switched between this and the morphe
one but I don't know something about
this just makes me love it you always go
back to it I do out using this
foundation as cream contour because it
just blends like because this same
foundation is the foundation of actual
skin feel like it just blends in really
well but it's see comments in my last
video when I
you sit um I got my highlight and I
completely agree like my hairline for
some reason why I didn't blend it well
enough so that's one thing you have to
be careful especially if you have a time
like me I feel like the hairline just
foxes all over to be quite honest or so
is anyone going to beautycon because I
may or may not be there doing something
with two other youtubers that you may or
may not know that is going to be so much
fun with a brand that you may or may not
know I don't know if we can tell you I
don't think I can so I would say I'm
gonna like not but um if you go in and
leave a comment down below because I'm
going to be there I'm really excited I
went to the one last year as well and
it's so crazy because when I went to
last year and I'd literally like
probably been doing YouTube like yes
blessing EW and I had like 50,000 maybe
not even that like 50,000 40,000
subscribers um and like it's just
craziest thing like how much has
happened in a year so I'm really excited
to see like some of you guys that if
you're going for concealer I'm going to
mix the Maybelline fit me in the shade
ten and also the Too Faced English shade
light the Maybelline funny light
concealer I love this so much but I wish
they did this in more shades like if
anyone at Maybelline is watching this
right now please do this in more shades
because I'm always in between this and
15 or if I've not got fit turn on 15s
too dark for me so I like I love the
consistency in the formula this so much
it's an amazing concealer but I just
wish those motions of it because um it's
always hard it's a hard life but for it
like a drugstore concealer I'm pretty
sure it's um like five pounds from boots
um
this is amazing like a little bit so
much so I'm going to blend it out with
my Beauty Blender and then I'm setting
it with translucent powder bounce bounce
bounce bounce so I made this massive Z
palette filled with makeup geek
eyeshadows and I'm obsessed with it like
it's just all warm colors I love so I'm
gonna start with this one which I'm
pretty sure
I'm not going to know the names of all
them so like I'll leave a link them down
below I'm like a list and I am also not
fill it with me give you know which is
quite Satan so if you're in the US I can
speak if you're in America then I'll put
a link down below to the make it leet
start and if you're in the UK I'll put a
link to British ruse beautybay that
stocks them and I'm going to mix this
one which this is creme brulee and then
this one here which is like a sort of
murky thick sticky brass so I'm going to
concentrate it first like on the center
here and then just like blend it out
either way so I wanted to be like a
fairly even distribute distribution
what's everyone doing for Christmas this
year like we're seeing at home and what
my Nana and Grandpa had come in and to
spend it with us which did not come to
us for a while for Christmas which is
really exciting
well I am glad that we're seeing at home
because I do really love Christmases at
home I think they're always my favorite
we're going to take and I use them much
beautiful for that just like a regular
women brush and then I'm going to take
my Real Techniques shading brush this is
filthy
you'll love I'm going to use the same
shades but blend them under the eye so
if you haven't seen the other one the
way I do smokey eyes or like no liner
looks
I always structure my I use my lower
lash line because I start blending the
product and on my lower lash line and
then I can extend it where I won the
shape to be and it just makes your life
a lot easier because it makes it a lot
less messy because you create in the cut
shape with the brush from your lower
lash line so you know that it's going to
look Reich's it's just extending up to
you the tail of your brow and it just
gives you like so much less work on top
I got so it just gives you like a
boundary to follow so you know like not
to go past that line and I just think
it's like so much easier than trying to
like gauge it on top I'm going to take
bitten which is this one here and I'm
going to mix it in with this more like
purpley one I think I'm just going to
mix around like I'm going to use better
and then I'm also going to use cocoa
bear which is up here on this row I
think it
this one but could be that one if you
wanted to do a full video on what's in
this palette then let me know because I
did see a couple of tweets asking for
that but I don't know I could do it if
you want I will list all the eyeshadows
I abuse on below so you know which ones
are in this video but it's just hard for
me to know and I can't bother picking
them all out because they take ages to
like put back in I end up like digging
my nail in them so I'm just using that
same brush for the minute just to like
put the product to where I want at and
then I'll go in with like a tapered
blending brush in its head yeah so I'm
going for something quite like very
toned smoky sultry you know the drill
this like tapered brush is a map to 1/7
I believe um it's just like my favorite
for like more precise like they're just
going to Ariana building up those colors
so I'm using like this slightly more
dark dark hole might say darker purple
and also like this brown shade here and
then eventually I'll mix in a little bit
black this Wow your light looks like
these that pick on my favorite recently
like I still love umm wearing winged
liner and stuff but I don't know I just
like nowhere near as you watch so you
see I'm going to go back to the lower
lash line and just like intensify the
color values in the same shades and then
I'm going to take a angled liner brush
like so and I'm gonna um use the black
to line like a black eye shadow to line
my upper lash line just like is I don't
want to use a liquid liner or a gel
because we're doing something quite soft
and smoky but I do also like to have
black bear for when I put lashes on so
it's not as the blush that blushes the
lashes still blend nicely into my
natural one so I'm going to put lashes
on and do eyebrows off camera and then
I'll come back and finish the eyes off
okay so I've got lashes on I use
the looks lush in this as well see in
the shade in the style pretty on fleek I
think I like them this one's poking me
in the inner corner quite a lot the
minute this is my first time wearing
them so they're a little bit stiff um
but I like them the nice and fluttery so
I'm going to take small dirt by Mac I'm
going to pop this in the waterline and
then we're going to start smoking out
this lower lash line and I'm just going
to use like coke over again like a warm
brown just to blend that out and I'm
going to do that with a flat definer
brush take a flat shader brush like so
just because I like using that extra
like buff it out I'm just gonna
highlight on my inner corner just using
like a really pale shimmery shadow I'm
pretty sure this is ice queen I'm gonna
mix like ice queen like jewel chrome oh
my gosh guys I was on Kylie cosmetics SA
and I managed to order two of the
American so ones from what and once for
a giveaway which I'm really excited
about because we're about to hit 300,000
we might have hit 300,000 by the time
this video is up but I feel like it's
going to happen this week um which is
just like so excited what bronzer I'm
going to use dark mineralized Palace
today by Mac and just because I want
something quite intense shall we say for
highlighter I'm gonna use um sin by
urban decay and I'm also going to mix it
with the makeup forever and pro-life
fusion in the shade to like you guys
know I love this so much it's so fun
it's like a really nice gold color and
I'm just going to use this one in like
the center as like an extra part and
then for blush I've got a Marin rose I'm
going to use a really light hand with
this because quite dark but it's a
really nice column for autumn and winter
it's a really nice sort of warm like
bronzey terra-cotta shade it's got a bit
of a shimmer to it as well which I
really like
I'm going to take stripped down by Mac I
feel like he uses 24/7 and I'm pretty
sure one of the girls I used to work
with told me that this is being
discontinued that better be alive
because I will be gutted my lips are
still like slightly stained I use them a
really dark lipstick the other day and
it's just like I'm full
lutely stay in them it takes some prep
and prime lip by mark I love this book
to put under liquid lipsticks because it
helps it stay on longer and it
moisturizes your lips on my lips so dry
whistle if liquid lips can be quite dry
and this just like counteracts that I'm
going to use a naked liquid lipstick
this is really quite pale especially
when I got this much done on and so I'm
just going to use a little bit and sort
of blend it out I'm going to use the
shoe a lip topper in the shade
skinny-dip because I'm not use this on
can react it's like so stunning it's
like a really iridescent um gold shade
like look at that and then of course
finish up with a bit of setting spray
and we are pretty much good to go so
this is the finished look I really hope
you guys enjoyed this video give it a
massive thumbs up if you do and make
sure you subscribe if you're not already

to go anyway because I'm off to London

about that soon and yeah thank you for
