going to be a full day's first
impressions on this look right here so
how to say actually that's a lie yet
something I wanted to try to do but I
couldn't use which you'll see as we get
into the video and some things like
we're working to me but then I just
wanted a little bit more so I just added
in bits of other makeup here and there
and my hair is finally unleash and
blonde I feel like I've not really like
shown it too much from not like I'm
feeling about it but this is my hair in
my net see like it's like a lion's mane
at the moon and China maybe like nice
and curly and voluminous tonight oh yeah
this is the makeup that I've done I did
a little bit of a Q&amp;amp;A I also put up some
questions and then I kind of answered a
couple and then I have to get in so I'm
sorry if I didn't answer that many but
if you like the sort of idea of doing a
Q&amp;amp;A and a tutorial then let me know and
I'll start doing that because I don't
really want to do like property tours
anymore I'd rather they were just like
chatty about this Joss and my just the
makeup you want to see how a tube is
look and that the products are used and
my thoughts on them then just keep
watching
so for eyes I'm going to use this steel
pallet this is in the sort of shade I
guess much muscle so I did have a look
at the flop obviously not used it and it
comes with six much shades which are at
the top here and then six like muscles
which I'm guessing these are like
metallics I'm probably not I'm like I'm
going to use something else as well I
don't know what I'm going to use yet but
the maps like it's quite a natural
palette I guess other than these two
shimmers down here and it's not got any
like darker matte so I want to give like
the actual palette ago because anyone
know anyone who knows me knows that like
my original and my favorite palettes on
a search button to make it was the
sealer in the light palette so I'm
hoping this one is going to be just as
good and so I'm pretty much just going
to use I'm just going to mix this sort
of medium brown and this sort of like
topi shade in like on either side and
we'll just see how that goes don't
really know like what kind of oh that's
nice nice I've really been loving this
brush for transition colors at the
minute this is the back sage brush in
the large eye blender style and it's
kind of like tapered towards the
unevenness of like a fluffy brush it
goes a tiny bit tapered how can always
update was it and so it kind of just
fits into the socket really nicely buts
gel like blends out quite
it but I think if I've actually got any
other pellets to use as like a first
impression like I still have my kylie
one like the one that I got a Christmas
time I don't really want to use that
service about with limited edition it's
so hot I'm actually playing okay yep
they're really cute
libero so I don't have any other new
eyeshadow palettes as far as I can see
so I'm just going to whip out something
that I really like I just forgot to
reach for this I do really like it I
always forget to reach right now which
is at the tartlet in bloom palette and
it just looks like so I'm just going to
give this a go I'm going to use the
shade rebel which is that one there's
any kind of warm rich brown color and
I'm going to start and like defining the
outer corners with that I'm just going
to pop that there oh my gosh that's
about how pigmented these geezers I'm
going to do a bit of a winged again
today so you like this for me requires
so much concentration I'm all just like
ha sorry that I'm like not very
talkative at this point like assign this
bit hard I find this hard to do I sound
like hair and I'm using a product that
I'm obviously I've used before so it's
not other part of the video probably and
I had a girl comment on my last tutorial
which was like my summer glow makeup
basically asking like because if any of
you follow me on snapchat then you'll
have seen not so long ago I was saying
how I was kind of like not really
feeling doing makeup videos anymore like
makeup tutorials and she was basically
asking my because obviously I still do
do them she's basically asking do I just
do that because I got sent products and
because so that I can go on free
holidays and stuff which is obviously
not the case and I just thought I'd like
clarify what I meant by that now though
those of you who don't have me on
snapchat not so long ago I filmed a
tutorial and I basically filmed it
because obviously you know I always
stick to the same kind of makeup as you
can seem during my hair like I love warm
tones I love a winged out eyes I love
news lips and I found something quite
different and basically like some the
whole videos doesn't put the power
through it
and then I sat down and I looked in
there and I just
so they hate is the makeup I just like
this is so not me so I went on snapchat
and I just basically said like I'm just
not feeling doing tutorials anymore in
the sense of like tutorials to like
teach look if that makes sense like I
love sitting here and chat in and do
makeup and just doing makeup that I know
I like is that make sense
but I'm not really like I'm not a super
creative person when it comes to makeup
like I'm not going to be doing like
different looks every week because
that's just like not me I do all I take
my channel in like a bit of a different
direction in other ways as well like I
want to create like different kinds of
content rather than just makeup and
fashion obviously I love makeup in
fashion don't get me wrong but um I feel
like I kind of want to do a little bit
more at the same time so I just wanna
like clarify what I'm gonna buy that
like I'm not stopping they cook stuff
altogether like I still love doing get
ready with me and but I guess it's more
so like if you come to my channel
thinking that you're going to get a
different look like a different kind of
look every time and you think it's going
to be like an in-depth tutorial like how
to achieve this makeup look like that's
not really me there's so many makeup
artists on like YouTube and Instagram
and stuff that are incredible and so
creative and do different kind of looks
all the time and I feel like I tried
that for a little bit at one point but
it just like I never I just never really
liked the makeup like I don't know and I
guess like I just never was then excited
about the video I never really liked the
video and you can like that so I don't
know if I'm making any sense by saying
that but I guess like with my makeup
like videos now they're going to be more
sort of like chilled chat in not so much
about like chatting about all the makeup
as much what I just chatting about
running store and always like no I don't
do tutorials just a lot of time I get
products or like go on holidays or
whatever both holidays I have like been
on this year obviously I was so lucky
like so incredibly lucky to go so I'd be
surprised this year and neither of those
companies were makeup base so yeah I'm
just putting the app there you know so
you know a lot I might like do soon as
I'm using a product right now that is
technically not a new product I might
ask you anyone has any questions on
Twitter yeah I just asked on Twitter
yeah so I just kind of a makeup video
seem more chilled
I'll pretty much not always obviously
but a lot of my looks are always like
warm winged out and that's kind of just
what I like to do and so I hope you
don't mind that obviously like if you
draw if you prefer tutorials that are
like different and you know like
colorful and different things every time
which I'll do those looks every now and
then they just won't be as common
there's tons of channels on YouTube that
do that as well that I like specific to
like just makeup I kind of just like a
janessa like venture out and do
different I don't know what yet this is
the issue like I don't know what I want
to do but you know I kind of just want
to be doing like different things as
well as makeup and fashion so I hope
that answers your question
I could actually apply to a but just in
case like anyone was thinking the same
kind of thing anyone has any suggestions
as well for like things that you want to
see and honestly let me know because I
would look - no only thing with these
eyeshadows from Tarte like this palette
I don't know if it's just me that finds
this but if I apply them add don't blend
the marks straight away they really make
me work to like blend them like they
just stick there and stay probably us
are you going to have a meet up at some
point this year so I do want to meet up
I don't know well when it's going to be
and I kind of have an idea in mind
actually which I might save for like
later on in the year but I do you want
to do one of your like we've never
actually had like a proper me or where
everyone can just cut along in a car if
they want to and stuff and if you know
chart and things I feel like that we
really fun and I would want to have it
in Manchester because um being
Manchester based in all you know how it
is I'm pretty growing with leader which
is the shade down here it's just a
little bit darker I'm just basically
going to build up with like the darkest
ones now just like add a little bit more
depth and watch more told us tips on
losing weight and maintaining it and yes
I'm big I was thinking about doing a
like a video I'm sort of like my journey
with my body because I don't know many
people notice but there was a time when
I actually did gain like over a stone in
weight like within about six months or
so and and I've managed to leave like a
lot of it I probably lost about half of
it now and I kind of just maintain that
well if you are like mini pips drinking
was so important like I'm not just
saying that to be absolute more like
it's so important to like just make sure
that you drink at least like two liters
a day I'd say like Dominic I'm so bad
for it sometimes as well but if you do
that like every day you'll know is such
a difference especially like say half an
hour before a meal if you have like a
glass of water guarantee when you go to
eat like you won't eat as much because a
lot of the time like you body if you
feel hungry like your body's just
mistaken you be interested like to being
hungry so a lot of time like if you feel
hungry you'll eat but in reality like
you only need to have like a store and
you'll be fine so definitely drinking
water might still do a full video on
that I don't really know but it wouldn't
be like a workout routine and stuff
because I genuinely have not been to a
gym in about four months probably not
been searching like I'm not doing any
form of like intensive exercise
throughout four months so I can't really
like that's why it would never be like a
like I'd never do like a workout routine
like that just not me because I don't
really wear how it's gonna like just
probably should not so much for the
wayside is what's might be healthy is
just what the minute I just don't I feel
like when I move back home I'll probably
well I told myself like when I moved out
and got fat that I was but you know here
we are okay so one thing that I'm really
excited to try this is by Sela Steeler
again and this is one of the magnificent
metals like the glitter pigment cream
situation so this one is in the shade
smoldering satin Oh huh oh I really like
that yeah I have to say like you can't
really blend those out or feel meeting
love there let me love that you know
what I'm going to do a wing because I
feel like I've not done one on my
channel in a while so this is really
turned into a non full face first
impressions but I'm going to use them
makeup forever ink liner - liquid liner
and it's matte absolutely love this job
it stays in place all day which has been
so important to me in summer because
eyeliner just transfers I'm like a bitch
so this is what we're going to use I
promise like all of these products and
the products the brow products are new
products currently the eyes just aren't
anymore that is a long wing hard it's a
long wing okay so my eye has become all
wing and nothing else because I just
said that line way too thick on the top
oh I'm going to go and do it lashes
off-camera and then we're going to do
skin which I promise skin is all new
products so I'll be back in a minute for
primer we're having an absolute steal a
day today because I'm going to try out
the steel at one-step illuminate which
it looks like so in the box and I've
actually had my eye on this for so long
like I don't know why I'm not trying to
see you now but I've had my eye on it
for so long because the idea of an
illuminating primer always just makes me
excited so basically it looks like so
but you can see this sort of like swells
it's like different pigments and stuff
does it swell your way to a luminous
glowing complexion in one step this
innovative triple swirled serum
instantly Prime's brightens and
illuminates the skin so I'm just going
to apply this with my hat and what I'm
do I usually use this one open I'm going
to love this because cool oh wow it's
very creamy my gosh it is very like yeah
it feels really hydrate N and this melts
into the skin like really well the
actual light color when it swells out I
don't know if you can tell you can
probably tell making it quite pink and
then a for foundation I'm going to be
trying out the NYX total control
coverage drops I think that's how old I
think it'll be called I have kept a
couple of these shades I did actually
sell some of these on D part which I
just want to say if anyone seen my D
cluster videos like my makeup collection
and stuff and check my D part because
basically we decided like a bunch of
makeup that just wasn't right my skin
and was like doubles of what happens job
I sold a little bit on D part when I was
decluttering on my collection and we
actually managed to raise just under a
thousand pounds for charity which I just
think is incredible so thank you so much
to everyone who popped over to my depop
and pick some stuff up because we raised
millions together for a charity which
I'm going to talk about more on Twitter
so if you want to know more about that
then it will be a lot
so like what charities it goes to and
stuff but yeah next very kindly sent
over the full range of these foundations
but obviously like I don't need like the
very very painless ones and the very
deepest one so those are what I've sold
on depart along with a bunch of other
stuff and all the money has well it's
not gone yet but it will go to a couple
of different charities which is really
exciting so yes these are the ones I
have catch I've kept the shoes I've kept
a couple of others as well but I'm
hoping that these are going to match my
times we've got zero a eleven and twelve
and I've heard really good things about
this and really excite to try it the
only thing I've had is like obviously on
the back it basically advises like how
many drops to go it says two plus four a
light coverage three plus or a medium
and for full coverage bought from like
what I've seen for most people you need
way more than four drops for like full
coverage and we all know that I like to
go to full coverage so huh okay so 0-8
looks a bit like at the minute okay that
is twelve that looks about right to be
fair let me just like okay yes it just
says more drops more coverage I can't
open it oh my gosh what I was doing is
so awkward if I actually can't open it
my hands are like really fluffy from
that primer now right so that one's
really easy to unpin which is not shade
that muster oh my god I can't open it
haha no I'm not even joking like the
little budge what the hell that is not
sooner because like none of them really
much Oh like I'm just going to abort
mission with it it's just not working is
it but this is something that I've not
tried you either this is the new giorgio
money and power fabric foundation like
the full-coverage one so I'm wondering
obviously that much is quite well that
meant that literally much as my neck
perfectly so I might just have to use
that today instead so I mean we'll give
it a go
hmm not convinced can't like thing it's
because I know that it's like Matt I'm
just waiting for it to look like so
I'm probably going to pronounce your
name wrong and I'm really sorry but
Esther Esther
I well said that right she asked how are
you feeling about moving back home and
leaving your flat and plus I'm so happy
seeing you in your boyfriend you guys
are double thank you so much yeah I'm
kind of like excited to move home
because I honestly just felt like odds
the whole time I've been in this flat
like I can't really put my finger on it
I just not like felt myself at all
like I don't know what it is I just felt
like I don't like seeing it but I felt
down a lot like a lot of the time I
don't know I don't know if it's a flaw I
don't know if it's like all the changes
that have happened in my life like I
really can't put my finger on it so I'm
kind of just like I'm excited to go home
I'm excited to be at home for Christmas
time because like Christmas times one of
my favorite times of the year and I just
think that's like that's family time
like you kind of have to be at home for
questions I obviously I would have got
home anyway and but I'm excited to be at
home for Christmas time and so yesterday
then at time I could just not felt
myself for a lot of this year like I
just feel like this year's just not been
my arrow of it's not been feeling
anything I can't really explain it like
it's hard to explain but I just feel
like felt really out of it
felt like not myself felt like lost
without getting like super deep and
stuff so I'm kind of excited yeah I just
like get that back to basics back to mom
and dad back to where I started YouTube
like obviously like in my bedroom and
stuff and and hopefully it'll be all
right but I'm going to give this
foundation the benefit of the doubt for
now because I have to say it does look
pretty nice but I'm like how long does
it give a lot connects for because now
my skin it won't be very long like I'm
so picky with foundations so this is
some benefit and this is one of the new
boiled concealer so this is the airbrush
concealer they very kindly sent for
one's like four different concealers
over this is the eye brush once and the
oh they're all kind of like a cream and
consistency that all either in little
cream tubs or the hydrating ones like a
stick it's a medium coverage blur smooth
conceal it's your real life research
this soft focus lightweight concealer
covers dark circles fine lines and
imperfections with a flawless finish
it's virtually undetectable on the skin
melts on seamlessly it has a ten hour
long bar which is a big thing to say
it's waterproof and it also doesn't
crease or cake which if all those things
are true this is my dream concealer
because that's all I need I have to say
I'm not usually a fan of using creams
under my eyes just because my skin is
quite dry and they don't always tend to
work that well but I'm going to give it
a go anyway so I'm going to blend it out
with a Beauty Blender but because it's
like a cream I'm just going to take it
on a brush first and sort of like apply
it under the eyes I don't really know
like how much you need but I'm just
going to do it like so it just feels
quite hydrating through that all it
blends really well ok I think we can get
the cream like I expected it to be like
a little bit not the where it is just
like part of the harder to blend boot
yes it's not a liquid it just maybe
takes a little bit more to blend it but
quite um it's a very like creamy
consistency I guess so it's not like a
hard cream or anything like that so
another thing that I want to try some
benefit before I do pilot and stuff I'm
going to use the hoola kwikki contour
stick because I've had this in my jaw
for ages and I just knock around trying
it and so excited to try it because I've
seen so many good things about here and
Jordan again used it all the time on
holiday and absolutely raved about it so
I'm really excited about go pretty much
just a cream contour stick so I'm much
was just going to done I'm going to
apply like a fair amount from what I've
like seen it blends out like pretty um
what to it like it can blend out quite
share so I'm just going to start with
like that much
oh yeah might as well
a lot warmer on the skin than I thought
it was going to be as well like for some
reason I thought it's going to be a
little bit cooler just because of
dynamic with it being a contour stick
and stuff but I'm glad it's not like I
like a warm contour stick so yeah I
really do like ours I'd like a really
nice amount of warmth to say so again
before we set the face I'm going to use
a product that I am still it yet to try
which has been in my like one of my dogs
like so long and I've just in desperate
to use it somewhere you could ever not
pick it up so now is going to be the
time these are the iconic London drop
Caesar in the original color and the
lighter ones look a little bit pink and
I'm not really like into like a pink
highlight and the other ones are quite
dark so I'm just going to use the
original ones which is like the middle
shade so like how much you needed in
lieu gonna start with that they kind of
like melt into the skin like they're not
super blind in I would say they're kind
of like looking in a glow that makes
sense
so for brows NYX again very kindly sent
over a bunch of new brow products so I'm
going to use today what I got to done a
lot so I've got two of the micro brow
pencils one is in the shade chocolate
and the all that is in the shade ash
brown because my roots are still so dark
I feel like I have to use like a dark
pencil at some point even though I
didn't sort of want my roots with the
start but here we are so I'm going to
use chocolate first
so it's got a brush at one side and then
the product on the other is basically
just like a really tiny brow pencil so
we'll see how it goes quite a natural
pencil like you have to apply like a
decent amount of pressure like that
pigmentation from it which is fine
like it's a lot different I'm using my
goof proof-- by benefit where it's like
you barely have to touch the skin and it
gets like a good amount of pigmentation
and which is not a bad thing but it is
just your astral natural feel like it's
not darkness my brows I'm going to see
this like if I've got something this
darker yeah I'm going to use a product
by benefit that I'm not it's gone I've
literally never used this as well but
I've had it for ages so this is Cabral
and it's like the brow gel that I do and
since I've been like using pencils and
job does not like bothered with gels
recently so I'm going to give this a go
it's like a nice brush pop looks like
it'll be dark enough as well so many is
the brush that comes with because it
does have a little brush in the lid and
I don't do that it has like the brush
and product trying to speak when you're
doing brows this is not not something
that my name is my brow pencil by marks
just because like the handles not long
enough for me like I need a long handle
but it's good to travel like I just use
it to shovel this is nice this is real
nice so I'm just going to go on top with
my precisely brow by benefit and just
oh yeah something about benefit brow
pencils that just make me feel all kinda
lose all right last but not least I do
have a NYX brow mascara so this is in
the shade age what shade is this
expresso up espresso so I'm just gonna
oh that's nice quite a big ones but I
don't mind that oh yeah I like that
I'm just going to finish it off
underneath the eyes I'm just going to do
a bit of black eyeliner I'm like the
same shadows that we use on the top and
a bit of lower lash mascara which is see
me do a million times and you know how I
do it so just going to finish that off
camera and I'll be back to finish off
the skin in a minute okay so I've done I
just put some black eyeliner on like I
said like a call in the wars line and
then just sort of like blended out with
the colors that we used on in the crease
on the part and this foundation has
definitely oxidized like really quite
badly it's gone very orange which it's
not like crazy noticeable on camera but
I can definitely tell like in my mirror
so something to bear in mind with that
foundation I'm just going to finish off
the skin and do a lip so for bronzer
I've been so excited as well this is new
Marc Jacobs Omega bronzer in fantastic
so and it's absolutely huge the compact
is like the Davis runs that I've ever
owned in my life so I'm really excited
to try this
owl and it obviously we've already got
the cooler on so it's not going to make
too much difference lot desk cute well
that's nice I'm not going to put too
much on because I don't want to like
overdo it but I really like the art
really like that one design in two
seconds I travel it change on that in
like two seconds I've got one of the new
at Jeffrey's tarts some at some
sno-cones I've got all of the new and
skinned frost this one is in the shade
it's from a snow cone so I'm gonna give
it a girl again it was very kind of sent
over by its beauty base so I'll try and
leave a link down below if they've still
got in stock right it's kind of scary in
the pot will don't play mate yeah it's
pretty scary in the pan like it's like a
bright yellow so I'm going to give it a
go
and just like hope for the last oh yeah
though it's nice Lisa doesn't come out
like yellow on the skin it just looks
kind of golden which is nice okay and
then it fought lip again I'm going to
give one of the jeffree star and chrome
collection items ago so this is the
valid liquid lipstick in the shade but
naked which this is like my favorite
color when I saw all the colors this is
the one that was most drawn through
obviously because it's like a nude so
I'm going to give this a girl it looks
quite pale skinnies spice lip liner by
Rimmel alright that is so pale
let me just success it's a little bit
like white pink now it's like waiting
for the normal it's B so just going to
go over with a makeup forever glass
because that looks like pink now Jesus
Christ what is it looking into so I'm
just going to go and sort myself out of
camera now and just do my hair and
change out this jumper and stuff but
this is pretty much at the finished look
feel like after all the little traumas
we have it's come out pretty well I'm
not convinced on the lip like I might
change this it's not the worst thing but
I just feel he doesn't look right with
like I don't know something about which
is not really like it's wear off and
yeah I'll be back in a second
okay so this is the finished look I have
transformed myself I'm a change woman
I've taken a higher down Unleashed it
all
Kelsey a little bit I sterling to finish
it it's not like completely gone by just
Kelly's hair is so boring does anyone
feel like that I find no metallics I
just got like so washed because it's so
long as well I'm just like them now and
yeah this is pretty much the finished
look I did switch to live out in the end
because I feel like the lip just wasn't
working for me so the lips I've got on
is stripped down
let's liner by Mark oak lips what oka
lipstick sorry also by mark and then
I've got a Mariah Carey matte gloss on
but any news gloss would do probably my
favorite thing of this is the eyes I'm
really loving the eyes but I mean these
are just typical headaches and a nice
I'm quite like my brows today they're a
lot bit more structured as I said the
normal and I really like the kabrel
tell me by benefit and the mascara by
NYX I had to say foundation is holding
up very well I like this Giorgio Armani
R which as you know from what I said in
the video I would like I was in too
hopeful about air but it's holding not
really well like it looks really good
and I still not blended it down my neck
and it doesn't look too bad to be honest
like basically I'm not done it because I
don't haven't been a well white-topped
yeah and if I put a white cap on I'd
rather put that on before I do my neck
if you don't I mean make up problems let
me know if you have any of these folks
yourself in the comments I'm not using
for them and let me know what you see
that part of this look is because I
would like to know and let me know as
well what other videos you want me to do
because as I said I'm trying to like
switch things up do more interesting
things mix up my channel there and yeah
I'm going to go anyway because I've got
a picture Millie and Dell up because
episodes was going out in the town but I
love you guys so much I love you to the
moon but a million times over and I will
see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
