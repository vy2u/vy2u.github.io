you having a lovely week
so I've genuinely already started from
this video I've been filming it for the
past half an hour but I've honestly had
to take my makeup off because it ended
up looking at that bahut so today we're
just gonna have a sit down in a chair
and get ready and do our makeup and
things like that I have got a bunch of
new products that I want to try out
which is kind of why it turned into a
disaster the first time because there
was just some stuff that did not work
but yeah we're gonna start fresh and
hope for the best
so the first product I'm gonna go in
with is the touch water cream this is
something that I have been using a lot
recently and I'm absolutely obsessed
with it it's just like so hydrating on
the skin I feel like it sits really well
under makeup as well like my paws and my
skin always looks really hydrate edge
when I use this it's not the sort of
moisturizer that I would usually like
because it's kind of quite thin and
consistency like I usually prefer stuff
that's quite thick um but for some
reason it just sits really well like
under foundations and stuff like that
can't believe I've just had to restart
this video I think I've only ever had to
do that like one other time in my whole
time doing YouTube I'm just gonna use a
little bit of eye cream as well so this
is the rodeo dragon's blood
I shall um just because I honestly my
eyes get so dry especially my eyelids
like if I don't put eye cream on my
eyelids will just flake like it's that
part
oh I need to do my sponge I've nothing
my sponge okay once I'm back at it again
so for primer I've got the benefit
Porefessional pearl primer I'm not sure
if I've used this on camera yet I feel
like I have but I might have jumped that
I'm just like obsessed with this stuff
at the minute just because my pores have
been looking a little bit larger
especially like in my sensual cheek area
this really helps to smooth everything
out and just give like a really flawless
finish foundation I thought we'd try out
the L'Oreal 24 hour and fallible Pro
glow foundation so this this one's in
the shade 2:04 so I'm hoping it's gonna
match because my fake tan is pretty much
gone now yes it's a radiant finish you
can wear it for up to 24 hours the
coverage is medium and the
is our light I haven't got a lighter
shade this is the lighter shade that I
have so we're just gonna have to make it
work
boys and girls okay so far so good so
the first time I film this video I used
the makeup forever
it's like the new Ultra HD skin
Perfector I think it's called and I
didn't realise but it was like kind of
more of like a skin tin but to the point
where I felt like I put it on and my
skin just looked no different I mean I
do prefer more of like a natural finish
at the minute like I don't like to wear
anything too thick but it was like to
the point where I just felt like you
couldn't even see it on my skin at all
yeah so far that looks really nice like
it feels light on the skin it's given
like a nice amount of coverage doesn't
look cakey it's got a really nice glow
to it so the concealer I used the first
time around was the model zone cover it
full coverage concealer this was just
not the best for my skin at all firstly
because I was kind of in between two
shades so I used the shade one and the
shade light no the shade one in the
shade two so I use like the two lighter
shades medium which is number two I
found was a way too pink and then light
which was I believe the lightest shade
and was just too light so I was kind of
somewhere in between and it just didn't
look right under my eyes because I
needed a different shade also it's so
thick this concealer I'm not gonna put
it back on now because it just wasn't
right for my skin and but it was just
super thick it felt really heavy under
the eyes and it looked too shiny as well
which was kind of unusual for me for
like a full coverage concealer yeah all
in all that concealer just wasn't for me
but that's the only new concealer I had
it's a minute to try out I feel like if
you need a full coverage concealer then
you might enjoy it and I think for spot
concealing it'd be good but for under
eyes it just didn't work for me so I'm
just gonna use my makeup revolution
instead I haven't been using this a lot
recently like I keep forgetting to use
it for some reason but yeah this I do
really like like it's been a while since
i sat down and felt I hadn't upload a
single video last week which I just was
not happy about but again like I just
ended up being super busy and I have the
minute I'm finding it really difficult
to film in this room because it's just
impossible to put lights up like at the
minute I'm usually I'm using natural
daylight to film this so it's okay like
when it's a clear day in things but a
lot of the time like when I come to edit
a video that I've done in natural
daylight like it just still looks quite
dark so I don't know it's weird like I'm
just waiting I'm so excited to like move
into my office which hopefully should be
happening in a few weeks
so I don't know I'm finding it really
hard to like motivate myself to film in
this room in a minute when I know that
I'm gonna be filming in like a much
bigger and just better space soon but
there's so many videos at the minute
that I have in mind to film so I'm
really excited for that like I've got
loads of video ideas and stuff that I
want to upload full yeah I'm gonna use a
little bit of Charlotte Tilbury powder
in the shade one just to set under my
eye nicely last week was actually a
really nice week because at the weekend
and stuff it was so sunny here in
Manchester and so yeah we just spent
like loads of time outdoors me and Kane
took toffee to the park for the day and
had like a picnic and stuff which was
really nice okay so I'm gonna give this
a go this is actually by Abby makeup and
I didn't get around to using it in the
video that I filmed with them but I
really want to try it because it's a
Cassie Lomas product and she really
braved about this like she said it was
one of her favourite products that she's
done with them so this is the whipped
bronzer so I don't know how to apply
this I'm just gonna go in with a buffing
brush I think so it's kind of like a
mini chanel like Tunde Soleil
kind of vibe one thing she did say is
that you really don't need a lot like
that's all so I'm just gonna wipe off a
little bit
excess I'm just gonna kind of just this
around my full head on my cheekbones and
stuff like that
you like this kind of product as well
it's just so easy for summer like you
can kind of just stipple it on even if
you didn't have foundation I know
whatever Korean products just always go
on way kind of more natural than powders
do I'm really excited because me and
Kayne actually going to Barcelona this
weekend which I've been to Barcelona
when I was like a lot younger with
family but I haven't been I haven't been
at back since and from what I remember
it was like really nice and then we're
going to Santorini next week which
Santorini has been like one of my dream
places to go for so long just looks
absolutely insane like it looks so
stunning gonna be a lot for photos for
that I'm hoping to film like a lot book
as well because um I really want to do
like a summer lookbook this year and do
like bikinis and just like I do a full
round oh we like bikinis um going out
outfits and then like daytime casual
stuff as well like holiday and then I
might do like I could get ready with me
whilst I'm there
do like a summer summer glumly that was
a really nice kind of just I did like a
nice bit of warmth to the skin I do have
a different product from makeup forever
that I want to try and so this is the
ultra HD soft light so this is more like
a liquid highlighter vibe I'm gonna try
the shade 30 which is kind of like a
pale gold and it's got a really cute
applicator it's like a little glass
dropper or is it plastic I think it's
plastic actually so I'm just gonna drop
this on the skin I guess and then just
blend it in I don't know I'm very
natural but it blends out really nice
liquid highlighters are always a bit hit
and miss me cuz I feel like some of them
just don't blend out some of them you
can't really see oh that was like
liquid highlighter karma whoo that's
actually really nice because one thing
that I always worry about is that if
I've powdered my under eye and like
around my under eye is it gonna get
patchy but let's blend it out so nice
I've got this product from Kiko which
looks really interesting but also
terrifies me
so this is a bronzer loose powder and
it's in the shade 0-1 natural honey so
it's literally like a bronzer that's
just a leaf powder like I feel like this
could go everywhere and just make such a
mess but I'm gonna try it anyway right
so it's literally I don't know how I'm
gonna do this I'm gonna top swimming the
lids like so just falling everywhere and
then I guess I'm just gonna take my
brush wow this just looks like a
disaster waiting to happen
oh actually alright again I feel like
that would be so good for holiday just
to kind of walk on without foundation or
whatever my skin's looking so much
better this time honestly I can't even
tell you how bad it was the first time
we've got some new highlighter powders
from NARS that I thought I'd give a go
so this one's in the shade Ibiza which I
feel like could be a bit too dark but
we'll give it a go mmm okay so I feel
like it might be a little bit too dark
for my skin but the actual finish is so
pretty
whoo Wow right okay so the shade down is
for different so that's a little bit
lighter I will give this one a go just
kind of go on top
oh yeah that's a bit of me it's funny
because when you swatch it and they
don't actually swatch very well at all
like on the skin so they kind of look
like nothing when you swatch them but it
just goes to show like how finger
swatches and stuff really don't
necessarily display like what our
products are like I've got one make up
in what feels like ages because I don't
really wear it anymore in the day like
pretty much the only time I wear makeup
now is if I'm filming or if I'm going on
like a night out so I don't really put
anything on in the daytime which I know
some people are gonna think is like
crazy so I'm just gonna go in with a
little bit of hoola by benefit I've
actually hit pan on it now which is a
little bit I heard so one through those
that I just never used to use it and it
just kind of sat in my collection and it
I just didn't use it at all but now I
use it
like all the time cuz I feel like it
just gives a little bit more structure
okay under I and we've got some new
eyeshadow bases from Sigma so I've got
one in the shade bubbly and then one in
the shade persuade think I'm going to
use a little bit of persuade first and
just apply this like all over the lid
it's got a bit of like a pinky tone to
it so some into that in mine the palette
that I'm gonna use today is by model
zone so I don't think this is like super
new anymore but I'm not used it yet so I
can't open it so this is the belly that
number to palliate the shades in there
I'm obsessed with like they're just
really nice warm neutrals I'm gonna
start off with this shade here which is
called slip I think oh wow that base is
creased a lot already
woah I don't know how I feel about that
it's at it with powder because I just
assumed with it being an eyeshadow base
you won't need to set it wow it feels
pretty sticky feel like because those
concealer under the base that's probably
why it's creased a bit okay I'm gonna go
in with this shade hair and I'm just
gonna use a tapered brush wow they're
like super pigmented not really powdered
underneath properly so this could be
another disaster mmm cute I'm trying to
like top off a little bit cuz I don't
really want too much fallout
yeah I don't know something feels really
sticky as I'm blending air and I'm just
gonna assume it's the eyeshadow base
this palette is really nice
I'm not entirely sure how much it is but
I'll leave I'll link it down below
you know this palettes blending really
well like I'm really impressed I'm gonna
go in with a tiny bit of the darker
shade just a little bit I'm just deepen
that a bit more got a product here from
Charlotte Tilbury so this is the eyes to
mesmerize pot in Hypnotizer is that the
shades oh no I think Betty's the shade
I'm not entirely sure like a really
pretty bronzy Gold's so maybe we'll use
this on the lid a very mu C in texture
so I'm just gonna take a little bit on
like the back of my hands and then just
go in that's a really pretty like really
pretty I'm kind of using it to like cut
my crease out a little bit as well
because it's a cream you don't really
need to go in with concealer you can
kind of use the product to actually cut
the crease as well I'm actually gonna go
back in it with that Nas highlighter and
just pack that on so I'm just gonna take
a fluffy brush and just dust that on the
inner corner this highlighter is so
pretty so I'm actually gonna do a just
mascara today rather than lashes because
we've got a mascara that I really want
to try out so this is the by Terry um
mascara well basically a waterproof
mascara by vitamin E what I'm actually
gonna do just before mascara I'm gonna
take the dark brown in the palette that
and just a flat definer brush and I'm
just gonna define the very outer part of
my lashes I usually do this when I put
falsies on but I also kinda
like to do it with just in the sky
anyway because it makes you lashline
look a lot thicker and it only tastes
like a next share second or two I've
been using eyelash serum eyelash serum I
don't know why she let's say that a lash
serum recently that I've been really
enjoying I feel like it's helped just
fix my lashes a little bit cuz my
natural lashes are just not the best at
all what a prima scar is usually a
winner for me because I feel like it
holds a curl really well
the be honest it's very natural I would
say so I feel like it I did a lot of
length to my lashes then but it's not
added any thickness there to that it's
build in pretty well it's definitely
added more thickness all we've got left
to do is lips and I've got a couple of
different products that again I want to
try out so I've got two of the box in
plump liner lip liners which I've heard
such good things about so we've got one
in the shade White Russian which I might
use this shade and not get the other one
oh so we've got one in White Russian and
then one in stealth so I'm gonna go in
with the box to him plump line lip liner
in the shade stealth and then the liquid
lipstick that I've got today is by
makeup revolution this is in the shade
undressed I think this is like a new
product from them and then in terms of
lip glass we've got a new product from
NYX this is the duo chromatic lip gloss
in the shade fair play so it's kind of
like it's much it's just a duo chrome
lip gloss it's kind of like pink with
more like a yellowy gold reflect so
we're gonna give that a go as well okay
so this is the finished look and in
terms of the lip I do like the lip liner
and the liquid lipstick by revolution
it's quite share so you kind of need to
build it up a little bit and even so now
I don't feel like it's fully opaque so
just something to bear in mind what the
colours really pretty and then the gloss
by NYX I really like because it's not
too duochrome to the point where it
looks like really crazy I feel like it
just adds like a really nice reflect to
the lip but yeah all in all I'm pretty
happy with how this makeup came out
considering that I genuinely have to
refill in this video and stuff
crash foundation I think looks
absolutely stunning the bronzer looks
incredible the highlight I'm living for
eyes everything about this look I'm just
obsessed with but yeah leave links to
everything down below if you're
interested in picking anything up
honestly I'm pretty impressed with
everything like there's nothing that I
don't like about the makeup so yeah I
really hope you enjoyed it thank you so
much for watching as always I love you
guys come in and back and I'll see you
in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
