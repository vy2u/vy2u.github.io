having a fab day we just talked about
these earrings first of all like I'm
absolutely obsessed okay today's video
is going to be a drugstore haul because
I did actually mean to film this last
week and I was basically gonna film the
whole and then do kind of like a
drugstore first impressions this week
but super drug completely mucked me off
I basically paid six pounds for Nexo
deliver and it just didn't turn up and
then it came on a day when I wasn't in
so I had to go all the way to the post
office like the collection office on
Monday and get it I haven't got like
tons of products to share with you so
it's probably not gonna be like a super
huge haul but I'm really excited about
everything I picked up so I'm just gonna
get straight into it okay I'm gonna get
this out the way first because this is
the biggest product this is the Lee
Stafford the original chopstick styler
one so my friend Marty here on YouTube
has a really cool hair tutorial where
she uses like a chopstick wand and just
really tiny like ringlets curls which
just looks so good on her she's like she
suits them so well a link of muddies
channel down below if you're not already
subscribed make sure you go and check it
out cuz i promise you will love her yes
she's got a really cool hair tutorial
and I've seen desi Perkins and a couple
of other people do them as well where
they use really kind of thin skinny ones
as you can see and just create really
tight curls like what the model has here
I've always wanted to keep one of these
ago and see if it'll actually work on my
hair cuz you guys know my hair is so
long but I love like the kind of vibe of
this hairstyle because it just gives you
has so much volume and texture which is
what I kind of lucked sometimes because
it's also so heavy and it just weighs
down at the roots so I'm excited to try
that let me know if anyone's tried this
and what you think I feel that there's a
different there's lots of different kind
of styles of this chopstick wand but
this is the one that I found on super
drug and it had really good reviews so
fingers crossed it works it might take
me a while today but you know okay and
then another super random product this
is some coconut oil for hair and skin so
again this had really and good reviews
on the website I feel like coconut oil
is just coconut oil like there's not
much more it can be if you're not I mean
but I've been meaning to pick up some
coconut oil for so long now because I
feel like it's just such a staple
especially for like hair and skin like
hair masks to kind of moisturize your
hair out skin face mask overnight mask
your nails because my cuticles guess so
drei also for just removing makeup
because now that I'm kind of wearing
more waterproof mascara like I
absolutely love my Max Factor two
thousand calorie mascara this hopefully
is just going to help to remove it a
little bit easier because even things
that claim to like remove waterproof
makeup like certain wipes and micellar
waters and cleanses and whatever else I
feel like they never quite do the trick
you like my skin is just always dry my
hair is always dry like I just need some
moisture back into my life so fingers
crossed this does the job okay so
speaking of nails I actually did pick up
a couple of products that are
specifically for nails as well because
my nails how many times can i say nails
I don't know my nails get so dry like my
cuticles in particular just get super
dry my nail beds aren't always super
healthy because I do sometimes get
acrylics I've actually not about any
acrylics on at the minute because I kind
of want to like wean myself off using
them it's sad though because I just love
the way they make my hands and my nails
look so I picked up a couple of products
to kind of help with cuticles and like
nail strength and things like that the
first one is by a brand called key text
and this is the intense recovery salon
strength treatment for weak peeling and
dry nails I've never tried anything from
this brand before and if anyone's use
this product I'll use anything by
Cusack's and let me know and let me know
what your thoughts are because I'd be
really interested to know but yeah I'm
really excited to try this
anything that will kind of it saved my
nails and just make them feel healthier
and more kind of moisturized and you
know not so dry I don't like having
giant cuticles and nails so this one's
kind of a similar vibe this is by Essie
which
Essie nail varnishes I do really enjoy
sometimes some of them are a bit hand
theirs but some of them I do really like
so this is basically a nail primer and
on the back it just says it's formulated
with iron strength and a protective at 5
min shields as it helps to protect
against breakage resist peeling and
splitting and it gives you visibly
stronger nails that's the one thing I
hate when I'm not going too quickly song
because obviously when you've got
acrylics on it or like a gel manicure
whatever your nails feel really strong
but when it's just like my bare nails
they break and like split so easily it's
really annoying but yeah I'm excited to
give this a go I'll try using it
itself and also try using it under
actual colored nail varnishes and see
what the vibe is I do have a male
bondage on at the minute I'm not going
to show you too closely because it's
smudged I was saying this on Twitter the
other day no joke no matter how long I
leave my nails for I feel like they
always smudge and then I also picked up
a packet of the impressed press-on
manicure nails because I did actually
collaborate with impress on a video
which I'll put on the screen here if
you're not if you haven't already seen
it obviously I tried them for the first
time in that video but I did really
enjoy them they lasted really well it
was super easy to apply because they
don't have any glue or anything like
that and this style is just slightly
different to the one that I wore in the
video they're a bit more like spring
appropriate I would say cuz I kind of
like a nude baby pink color and then the
accent nail is like white with kind of
geometric pink leather on which I just
thought was really cute okay under your
actual makeup products I basically got a
bunch while not loads but a variety of a
drugstore makeup of course so the first
thing is by Maybelline this is the
burgundy bar palette when I use to do
tests and Tuesday's I absolutely used to
love doing them um I kind of want to get
back into doing them and just like test
more brands and stuff so I picked this
up from Maybelline because I obviously
I'm pretty sure didn't you want to
Maybelline when I used to do this like I
did a bunch of different brands I did
NYX and makeup revolution and new look
and stuff like that but I never did a
Maybelline testing video so I've kind of
got a couple of different products like
go towards that video if that makes
sense it's like I kind of want to get
this out and swatch it a bit even though
I should probably save it for the actual
video also if you want to know what
glitters on my eyes today's looks I feel
like a couple of people will ask this
glitter is by next and it's in the shade
0-4 I believe it's like a copper shade
it comes with a brush the Maybelline
palette which I would just never reach
for these I'm just going to swatch like
- there's not many maps to be honest
it's pretty much like nearly all
shimmers oh that's pretty
so those are those two that just kind of
like a light fingers wash they actually
seem to swatch quite well
oh my god what the hell they're like
super pigmented I'm excited to try that
now let me know if you want a testing
video if you just want it in a get ready
with me / first impressions cuz you know
I can do I owe another product that I
picked it up from Maybelline which I
didn't even realize they had these in
the UK yeah I feel like correct me if
I'm wrong because I usually am wrong but
I feel like these were only available in
America for a good chunk of time and I
always used to see the money
instagramming in people's videos and I
just used to want to try them so bad so
this is a Maybelline master chrome
metallic highlighter it's in the shade
100 mulching goal every time I see these
in like videos and stuff I'm just like
wow they look so pretty so that is the
color that always pretty I put in there
oh wow kind of reminds me a little bit
of my makeup frother pro light fusion so
it's just the one on the end that and
yeah it kind of just reminds me of like
my makeup forever yeah pro light fusion
in the shade - not as like blind in but
definitely has like a really good color
payoff and then I also picked up a
Maybelline fit me concealer this is in
the shade 10 because 10 is what usually
matches me the best when I've got a tan
it's a little bit darker than 15 but
also a little bit more yellow as well
and I love this concealer but I'm pretty
sure all the ones that are in my drawer
now are just a bit monkey and like gone
off so I wanted to pick up another one
just to you know use and love again okay
and then onto some fun stuff I picked up
three shades of the new makeup
revolution concealer because these are
everywhere literally they just flood
they just flood my feet on YouTube with
a minute so many people I kind of
filming with these and raving about them
and just loving them I did actually do a
makeup revolution testing video a while
ago and the concealer that I used it was
just the worst concealer I've ever come
across in my life it was awful like it
was just so bad I don't know if anyone
remembers that video or seen that video
but I basically applied it to my skin
and it just wouldn't blend and it just
removed the foundation and you just kind
stayed in the lines that I'd applied it
if that makes sense like you know how
you'll play it from the wand under the
eye and kind of like strokes and lines
it just stuck straight away it was the
strangest thing I've ever used in my
life and I had to remove it straight
away so the fact that they've brought
out a new concealer this is called the
conceal and define full coverage
concealer and contour every one I've not
seen a single bad review on this year
I'm not seeing anyone say anything you
know negative about it or anything like
that I picked up the shades c5 at c6 and
c7 so I don't really know what's gonna
match hopefully I've got something in
here that matches and I'm pretty sure
they are extending the shade range of
this as well so come March time I think
they're gonna have about 25 at shades
ranging from like fat to deep which is
of course a fabulous but yeah I'm
excited to try this if you want me to do
like an updated makeup revolution
testing video then I will but if not I
can just again include these in like a
first impression or something like that
a couple of people have mentioned
comparing it in a video to this heart
shape tape so again I could do that but
I feel like a lot of people have done
that already I don't know just let me
know let me know what you want I also
picked up a couple of lipsticks from
makeup revolution because I can't
remember who I was talking to about
these like it was one of you guys and I
can't remember where or when like I just
have this really kind of vague memory of
chatting to someone about makeup
revolution lipsticks someone was just
saying though that they are incredible
and kind of like comparable to muk which
is obviously pretty high-end so this one
is the iconic matte nude revolution
lipstick in the shade it just has really
cute
rose gold packaging so we'll give her
ooh a little swatch oh wow that feels
quite nice so that is the shade down
there it's kind of like a peachy brown
shade I would say and it looks very
similar actually to my Anastasia Beverly
Hills liquid lipstick in the shade naked
which is one of my favorite shades of
all time because I always love like a
peachy nude over a pink nude lip that
I've gotten today by the way is Kylie
cosmetics dirty Pete I feel like I've
just got a peach vibe on the go you know
the second one is the iconic Pro
lipstick in the shade
you are beautiful which I thought was
really cute so I got two nudes you know
how it is so this one feels a little bit
more barmy and a bit more sheer it looks
a bit more glossy than the first one
that we swatch it's underneath there I
think so that kind of similar shades I
feel like you are beautiful it's a
little bit more pale I got two palettes
from makeup revolution because I do
remember really enjoying kind of like
the part of powder products from the
brand so the first one I had to grab
because I saw the colors and I was like
that is me that is me all over so this
is the makeup revolution reloaded
neutrals 2 palette they've actually
spelt in neutrals and e WT like new so
that is what the colours look like as
you can see it's kind of similar gives
me like modern renaissance fives if you
know I mean it's just so like the warm
pinks and the warm oranges and the warm
red I'll swatch one matte and one
shimmer shade okay so those are the two
shades that i swatched there and we'll
just oh pretty so those two are at the
bottom and then the second one is the I
love makeup London this is still makeup
revolution isn't it so this is called I
love makeup London but I swear this
looks like part of makeup revolution but
it doesn't have makeup revolution
anywhere on it this is called the
chocolate orange palette so this for me
is just like a complete ripoff obviously
you have to Faced chocolate bar palettes
but it's what it's genuine they take in
everything from a two-faced palette and
just done the exact same because Too
Faced always has I think every chocolate
bar does or at least most of them they
always have kind of a large pound at
this side on this side as well so it's
very similar shades do have names but
they come on one of these plastic things
which honestly these just make me so
angry I'm like what is the point I just
don't feel like anyone is gonna keep
that up plus it's plastic so it's pretty
 the environment I just think it's a
waste it's a waste if you're not gonna
put them on the actual palette then you
may as well just not name them like they
don't need names but again the color
selection is like super warm super juicy
as you can see
so that kind of warm Browns reds purples
that kind of vibe i've swatched them
right on the end here they've not got
tons of color payoff but they do feel
quite soft so I imagine that they're
sort the sort of shadows that don't go
on super pigmented but kind of blend out
really nicely and just need a little bit
of building up so we'll see how it goes
I'm excited to try it either way now the
very last product is the makeup
revolution skin kiss in the shade
champagne kiss which the packaging for
this is huge like it's a massive
highlighter and just all these on the
website and again wanted to test it out
because you guys know I love a good
blinding glow swatch doesn't blow me
away to be honest I'm not gonna lie I
can't remember how much all this stuff
was but I'll link it down below it looks
okay but the swatch doesn't blow me away
like it looks a bit chalky on the skin
actually and it kind of has that
consistency that feels how do you
explain it it feels like not dumped but
like it just feels oh I dunno we'll have
to give that a go on the skin and see
what it's like but it's kind of like a
pinky champagne vibe I think that is
pretty much everything so I hope you
guys enjoyed this video let me know if
you tried any of these products in the
comments down below because of course I
would like to know I love you guys
coming back as always and I'll see you
in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
