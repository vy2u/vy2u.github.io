be a little bit different and this is
actually a video that I've been going
around a lot on YouTube recently and
it's actually a video that I've seen a
lot of you asking me to do the video
that I've seen a lot of people doing
recently we're basically going to be
looking at fake makeup compared to the
real products so I got all of these
products on eBay and to be honest like
I've always been so curious as to what
eBay makeup is like that's like you know
when you see a product and it comes to
be like a genuine product of like Kylie
cosmetics or anasazi Beverly Hills or
mark like a high-end brand that's like
quite expensive and then you see it on
eBay and it's like three pounds for a
product and you think what the hell are
they even selling so I was super
intrigued to buy some stuff I got three
products and I did actually got four but
all three of them have arrived so if you
enjoyed this anyone makes you a part to
you then let me know all of them are
absolutely atrocious I'm not even gonna
lie I don't even know how these people
get away with this but I'm sorry I look
so washed out as well I've got no fate
turn on and I feel like people don't
take me seriously when I tell them that
I am literally Snow White without feet
pan on I'm so pale okay the first
product is an eyeshadow palette this is
the hata bc textured shadows palette in
the rose gold edition so this is my real
genuine version and it's got really
lovely packaging it's got Qatar beauty's
eyes here and there's actually foiled
material on it before packaging which is
like the paper case like a foiled bar
and then the actual eyeshadow on ur eyes
is foiled and then it's got embossed
packs where the rose gold edition is
that it's actually like embossed you can
feel and then it just got a bunch of
information on the bar the actual
palette looks like so so it's got
clearcase and then you open it up and
you've got all of the products there
it's also got these same information on
the back as well so in terms of the fake
one so in terms of the fake palette the
first thing that I noticed is that these
size difference so the fake one is
actually a little bit wider you're not
really going to be able to see properly
but see if I line them up here I'll do
it like that
you can kind of see that this is the
fake one at the bottom sorry it's upside
down
and but you can see the actual product
is a little bit wider than the original
one like the real
so in terms of the packaging on the
front I'm pretty sure this is a soon
photo I think it could be the same photo
what the eyes look slightly different
well size is a completely different like
filter on them as you can see like the
actual coloring of the photo is so much
more washed out on the fake one there's
no oil effects on the packaging like
that is on the real line hopefully you
can see that and then the actual color
of the strip is completely different as
well as gold on here and it's like a
peach color on this one and then again
where it says the rose gold edition on
the real one down there it's like gold
embossed and on this one it's like a
baby thing
so there's honestly like not even try to
make it look legit I'm not gonna lie
feels a lot lighter in weight as well
and on the back it's got completely
different like information and then in
terms of the actual eyeshadows oh my god
is is what it looks like so it's got the
same style and case I guess at the same
cell pellet packaging and you open it up
and oh my god like it's just not even
remotely it's remotely similar but it's
just not at the same time and we get the
real one out against that you can see so
obviously in this palette hada beauty
has a formula of shadows that is like
the textured shadow which you can see in
the real one and they look super
metallic and super chunky so that is
what the real one is like that and then
in terms of the fake one to start it
again this is like flimsy plastic
whereas in a real one it's like hard
plastic and you can see like there's
maybe a tiny bit of shimmer in them but
they're not like the metallic foils
shadow they're just kind of like a
slight shimmer so the real one is on top
and then the fake one is on the bottom
and to be honest like the actual matte
shades aren't that bad is too foiled
ones that just completely give it away
that the shade henna in the fake one is
quite a pretty eyeshadow and it's got
like a decent amount of pigmentation
like those gold shades are supposed to
be the same color and that is completely
different the actual light packaging as
well
I don't know if you're gonna be able to
see but it's like a box like this could
just easily come off it's like the whole
thing just inserted into like a
cardboard box the packaging is just shit
it's so flimsy
yeah I think I'm going to stick with my
real one and you can get this on court
beauty I believe it's like 40 pounds
maybe I'm still yet to have a proper
play with it and I'm not convinced on
the textured eyeshadows yet I am going
to have like a bit more of a play with
those because I wasn't convinced the
first time but the masks are really nice
and I really pigmented and lovely moving
on few highlights at the highlight kit
that I picked up is by Anastasio Beverly
Hills and I decided to get the ultimate
glow kit because I haven't seen anyone
do this one yet although correct me it's
someone kind of so let me just make sure
I've got the real one right yeah the way
I tell with this one to be fair and the
packaging is very similar like compared
to the hood of beauty one like it's so
much more similar the pallets are pretty
much the same size and all the
information on the back like the
majority of it is the same so this one
does actually look kind of genuine only
way I can tell when I'm looking just
like this at them is the actual bloke
here on the anasazi Illuma glow care
actually glows in the dark so if you
angle it and you'll see that there's
kind of like little bumps all over the
surface of the actual glow kit tax
because when a room is pitch-black this
will light up or it's on the fake one
it's just like normal tap so you can't
see that and the actual packaging is
slightly lighter as you can see but I
wouldn't really like no I wouldn't know
which ones which unless I looked at the
actual glow kit and tax in terms of the
logo they're both very similar and the
boat embossed and they're both pretty
much the same text as well like they
look pretty similar so I'll show you the
real one fair so this is what it looks
like inside on the outside it's pretty
much just the same so you have the same
i'm glow care and the answers in beverly
hills and then you have the same
information on the back and then it
opens up and it has a big mirror here I
still have be like plastic bit on line
so it's got the logo czar and then it's
got the
Astacio Beverly Hills in gold text on
the mirror side and then at the bottom
you have six shades which look like so I
love this locate a couple of people well
a lot of people I feel like when a
massive fan of this because it is quite
glittery and I think when you apply it
with the right brush and you don't apply
too much it is really pretty so that is
what it looks like there you can't
really see the glitter properly on
camera and but that gives you like an
idea of the colors in it so they're
pretty much all gold toned and then
obviously you've got like the pure white
at the top here and then as for the fake
one like I said the outside is very
similar and the actual and again the
palette is pretty similar the text isn't
as nice it's got a darker shadow I don't
know if you'll be able to tell it's got
like a darker shadow on the actual glow
kit section and what you've got all the
same stuff on the back again and then
you open it up and it's got the same
mirror and the same under stars yet
Beverly Hills which is on the real one
and then us with the colors like they
don't look as off as the whole of Beauty
ones they do look different but like not
as noticeable I think the biggest
giveaway in this one well obviously the
shades are but also the text underneath
each shade because in the real one it's
the gold text that matches the Anasazi
Beverly Hills whereas in this one it's
kind of quite a large fun and it's not
embossed in the same way as it is in the
real one these other shades in the fake
one so as you can see they're all kind
of like a little bit dark I would say
and this one in the middle is quite
pinky and whereas in the real glow care
it's not pinky at all the white shade
has nowhere near as much like it has
pretty much no glitter in it whereas in
this one it's quite glittery and they
feel also they feel so oh my god it's
basically a cream it's like a white
cream it's like not even a powder so
this is them side by side again the real
one is at the top and the fake point is
at the bottom so it's not as bad but you
can see that this middle shape like I
said is a lot more pinky and the darker
shade of the pallet is a lot darker in
the fake point as well yeah again like
you can't really tell so much on the
outside but as soon as you open it you
can really tell and then on to the very
last product this is one of the Kylie
well this is the worst one out of all
three this is dreadful so I didn't want
to get a lip kit because I've seen a
couple of people doing a lip kit I think
saffron it did candy cane movie so I
wanted to get a lip glass but it's calm
as a liquid lipstick so wherever it is
that like produces this stuff and it
basically made like a so cute matte
liquid lipstick with a liner me and Isla
open this before this is like the only
one I've opened off camera like it's
awful so this is my so cute gloss here
it's a lip gloss by Kylie cosmetics it's
not a liquid lipstick it has never been
a liquid lipstick and it's just like a
beautiful really sort of pale nude gloss
it's one of my favorite new glosses the
only thing I don't like about Kylie lip
glosses is they're quite sick so they
kind of gather on the inside of my lips
which is really annoying so just feel
like I did just as thick but I love the
shade of this so much and then obviously
with this we've not got a lip gloss but
I thought I'd show you anyway so as I
said it's come in a is come as a liquid
lipstick and I don't have any of my
packages for my liquid lipsticks anymore
but one thing I can tell you is that the
fun on the top where it says the
lipstick name is completely different
when it is on the real one and also the
teeth I'm pretty sure the teeth on the
lips logo alike holographic or normal
color packaging whereas these just look
grey side down here looks quite similar
the actual Kylie fondant don't know if
you can possibly see looks like so and
then on the back it's got all the seams
just a normal Kylie lip kit would have
so it's got like and ingredients and
it's got like Kylie's tips which is to
like line the lips and stuff which is
what is on pretty much every lip care
and so I think that's kind of just
copied although I've not I've not
ordered a liquid lipstick in a while so
I can't remember exactly but I do
remember it looking like this so I'm not
ready for this color I'm telling you
right now you are not ready for what
color this is
I mean I would say can you see that but
it's basically luminous
so it's not even remotely similar it's
like not a nude it's a bright sort of
lie lucky pink it's kind of like Saint
you mean by map you see to me it's made
by mark and it's like a really bright
ping I'll swatch it next to the lipgloss
I'll also swatch it next to the liquid
next to like a liquid lipstick as well
so we can compare the formula and but my
gosh it's just tragic everything about
it just screams fake like the way that
Kylie is written on the actual like
liquid lipstick packaging like the whole
fun then I've bought the lip pencil I
mean to be fair for a lip pencil cause
good pigmentation feels kind of similar
it's a lot wuxia than the Kylie ones and
what the actual like packaging and stuff
is all the same so obviously do not
order makeup off eBay do that some
things that Oakley to order like but if
I ever order anything off eBay I'll
always contact the fellas and I'll be
like I need a receipt for this I need a
proof to purchase that you purchased it
from a genuine site especially if it's a
little bit cheaper than it usually would
be a lot of the time people will just
sell makeup on eBay because they don't
want it anymore or they have something
ordered to or something like that and
they will have a genuine product and it
will be a genuine price and that's kind
of how you know but always check for
receipts and for like proof of purchases
don't just buy shit on a whim and do not
buy anything if it's like three pounds
which is what the majority of these
products were because I guarantee you
will not want to put on face and it'll
be a waste of three pounds that you
could have spent on like chicken nuggets
or something incest so boys and girls
that is everything in this video I do
have more products but I'm guessing
they're just not coming time I got a
juicer liquid lipstick as well and so do
you honestly apart - then let me know
but I thought this would be a little bit
of fondant to film so that we could have
a look at some of the crap that people
managed to get away with on eBay
I really hope you all enjoyed this video
give it a massive thumbs up if you did
and let me know what you want to see
next week in the comments
other than that I don't think I have
anything else to say so I love you to
the moon and back and I will see you a
desert video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
