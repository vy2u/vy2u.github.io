okay so to start off this look I am
going to be using some scar wax by Ben
Nye I try to hold up every product but I
do forget in the end so if you want to
know any of the products that I've used
all of the products will be linked and
listed down below so just check the
description bar if you want to know
where anything's from and but I'm
starting off with the scarring first
because we're doing a sort of split face
look so I'm just taking a sort of like
really skinny sausage shape up there and
scar wax this is really fiddly so don't
worry if you have issues like mine kept
peeling off it took me so long to get
this stuff on and I just hold it up
against my skin and then I use tweezers
to peel one side away because you want
it to look like it's coming away from
your skin and then I'm just using some
Vaseline just to smooth out any bits
that are sort of like bumpy on the skin
so it looks like it's part of the skin
if that makes sense and then I'm using
the tweezers just to pull it away
because as I said you want it to look
like 3d and as if it's actually coming
away from your face so that it's like a
split face look then I'm just putting
foundation on one side of my skin the
skin that is the glam face I know a side
out with the eye already on that's
because I'm doing a full tutorial on a
all matte smokey eye so that will be
uploaded soon and I'm going to do the
exact look as like a full face of glam
and then I'm just using concealer and
just under the eyes and I'm just
blending this out with a 2-1 7 I'm using
smaller brushes because you want to be
careful not to like what or like knock
the wax and like the scar wax that we
just put down so that it stays in place
and then I'm just setting the whole
outside of the sort of glum side and
with powder and then I am using the
morphe 35o as always just to fill in one
of my brows you don't just want to start
mapping out the skull side and for all
the times I'm mapping things out I'm
using the studio chroma graphic pencil
by markets like a skin and colored
pencil so again I'll link it down below
just using that just so that I have a
good idea and I don't go straight in
with the black because that's harder to
remove I'll also link the flash palette
that I use down below it's like a dupe
for the makeup for everyone it's really
good I got on Amazon from 10 pounds
along with the brushes that I'm using
here so it was a really good deal it's
up to you how large or how small you do
your eye socket I wanted mine fairly
large and then I'm just put in some sort
of like I'm mixing in a bit of a white
two and create
a gray tone towards the bottom of the
socket just to add a little bit of
dimension and a highlight and then I am
using the same pencil just to map out
the cheekbone and the temple it's up to
you what shapes you do for these because
I do must suck it quite large
I want it be an temple fairly small and
whatnot so I'm always using like lighter
colors first so I'm using the white and
whatnot just to map it out because it's
a lot easier to remove and then black if
it goes wrong so you just want to fill
in the hole of light the canvas and
that's not going to be like the
cheekbone in the temple with the white
face paint like I said this flash
palette is really good for the money so
I'll link it down below if you want
something similar and then obviously
when you get to the section of the skin
where the wax is you want to be careful
again so again just using a smaller
brush that's a little bit more precise
just to get right underneath and the
actual wax and then just quickly mapping
out the nose with a black pencil and I
just had a picture for reference next to
me when you're doing a skull like
honestly just get a reference picture
and sort of follow the shapes and
whatnot and it makes your life so much
easier like if you try and do it off
memory you really just make any life
hard so I just had one on my phone next
to me just to make sure that I was like
following all the right steps and shapes
and whatnot so I'm just doing at the
nose like so and I'm just using a really
skinny brush again it came with the pack
of brushes that came with the flash
palette so as I said it will be linked
down below feel like I said that million
times now and then I'm just filling in
the opposite light side the other space
with the white paint as you should
I'm just rumbling now oh my god and then
you just want to carry on filling in the
rest that is not black with the white
and then I'm going to move on and do the
cheekbones so I'm just following the
sort of shape that we created with the
chroma graphic pencil which was the skin
tone one and I did do the cheek bone
fairly low at first which you're gonna
see in a minute I'm sort of looking at
it as I start filling it in and I'm like
I decided it's too low don't worry if
you do anything wrong like honestly just
take a makeup wipe and clean anything up
that you don't like like you don't have
to commit to anything so I just took a
makeup wipe and removed and the white
face paint and just cleaned up the black
just again and like just to sort of move
the cheekbone up a little bit higher on
the face and I was much happier with the
shape afterwards so
just going back in with the white to
clean it up and to create like a more
defined line and then I'm using my
finger to blend the black in with the
white I wanted a sort of ombre for the
cheekbone towards where the teeth we're
going to start so you just you can just
honestly that use your finger and like
the brushes and whatnot and just blend
them together and you just want a sort
of like um brioche grayish tone in
between the white and the black if
that's the sort of look that you want to
go for as well and then under the teeth
I'm just extending the smile line and
with a really skinny brush again it came
in the same pack and then for the actual
teeth and basically just follow in my
actual teeth lines so where the gaps in
my teeth are I'm just sort of eye
opening my mouth slightly just so that I
can actually see and the shape of my
natural teeth just to give me like a
good guideline and then as I get further
along the smile line I'm just making the
lines a little bit smaller because and I
wanted them to look like they're a
little bit further away and it just adds
like a little bit of definition and
makes them look a tiny bit more
realistic and whatnot I decided that I
want my teeth to have a sort of
triangular look but you can do whatever
sort of shape you want with you teeth
you could just leave the lines if you
wanted to and or you could make them a
lot bigger than mine are if you wanted
to it's completely up to you on how you
want the look to look and and then I'm
just sort of shading in between the
cracks and whatnot and adding a little
bit of definition again things like this
it is time-consuming but it's just like
so worth it in the end because it just
looks like that extra bit more realistic
I guess so
I'm just mixing in different bits of
like whites and grays and whatnot and
just shading them all together and
making sure everything is blended and I
like the way it looks with then moving
on to finishing it touches so I'm just
shading around the socket and around the
cheek bone and this is what makes it
really sort of come to life and because
it just makes everything like pop and it
makes it look like it's not just flat
face paint on you skin so I'm just
shading around the socket and the
cheekbone as I said and I'm using the
same shadows from the morphe palette
that I use on my brows just like
neutrals and like cool too and grays and
stuff and I'm mixing in like a little
bit of red as well just because it's
like why not and then I'm taking a
selfie
apparently so after that come on hand
get it together
after that I'm adding the glitter this
is like the most fun part I swear to god
I'm using a glitter by Mac I think it's
3d black maybe it's the black glitter
and so I'll link it down below
I love glitters by Mark they're just
like so so beautiful this one in
particular is so nice for like really
dramatic looks so I'm popping it on the
nose and like the inner portion of the
socket and when it catches the light
like it just looks so much fun
absolutely love it and then to finish
off the look I am taking a bruise wheel
by Ben Nye any sort of like cream
products that are like red or purple
will do and I'm just sort of like
stippling those over there and scab
wound just to make it look a little bit
inflamed and to again just add a little
bit of definition and whatnot but that
is the finished look so I really hope
you guys like this I hope you liked the
whole video and the concepts of it give
it a massive thumbs up if you do and
send me any photos if you recreate it
