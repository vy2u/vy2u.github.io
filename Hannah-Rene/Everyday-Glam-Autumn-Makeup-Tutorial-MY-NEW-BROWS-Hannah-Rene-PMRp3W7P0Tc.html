makeup tutorial on this makeup that I'm
wearing right now
I basically sat down and I knew it in my
mind that I wanted to create well I
wanted to create a daytime look and I
feel like this has gone a little bit
further than sort of traditional
everyday makeup look and I'm going to
call it daytime glam because it's still
kind of like basic in the sense that I'm
not doing a winged liner is that true
just like some shadow in the crease not
put anything on my lids and then I dress
them like quite a bold matte lip which I
love this color do my brows a little bit
differently to how I usually would so
hopefully you like it let me know what
you think in the comments down below and
I have actually had my brows microbe
lady which you're about to see in a
minute once I start the tutorial so
that's exciting because they're now a
lot naturally fuller which I'm really
happy with so yeah I'm gonna stop
rambling if you want to see how i got
this makeup look going on then just keep
watching okay so I'm gonna do like a
chassis talk through because I feel like
I'm not done one of those in a while and
I do have a top on I just want to throw
out there because whenever I've got a
bundle on people think I'm naked and I'm
not so I want to talk about my eyebrows
and then it because if you do not follow
me on social media you will not know
that I got them microplate is so I'm
gonna speak right a little bit and now
about my experience and stuff because of
people a couple of people have asked and
if this doesn't interest you feel free
to skip ahead but I have seen some
tweets about it and stuff so I just
wanted to talk about it since this is
the first tutorial I'm doing since
getting them done you don't know what my
bleeding is it's basically a form of a
semi-permanent makeup wear and it's very
similar to a tattoo so I feel like the
old style of getting your eyebrows done
a lot of people just got them tattooed
and stuff but it's different in the
sense that it's not a block of color and
it's basically you get strokes the top
layer B skin it gets like bladed as
strokes if that makes sense it sounds a
bit grim then you basically pop the
pigment on top and allow it to soak so
it looks a lot more natural than a
standard
tattoo which is the reason I chose to
get it - I got the microglia by a lovely
woman called Michelle and she's based in
Manchester so I'm going to put all the
details down below if you want to go
check her out I'm not saying please
don't think anyone like I'm saying
you need to get your brows done are you
browsing to look a certain way or
something I'm not seeing that at all
I just don't mind doing because um like
I said my eyebrows were very sparse I
over plucked them when I was quite young
because I thought it was the trendy
thing to do so I decided it to get them
micro bladed and which as I said is like
little strokes of like blade in the skin
and then you fill it with pigment and it
basically creates the illusion of
natural hairs because it's like a blade
stroke I'll zoom in so you can see he
might not be able to like actually tell
what's plated and what's not I'm going
to insert like I've actually filmed a
whole vlog so if you want to see the
procedure and you want to see the actual
like getting it done and like the day I
have it on because I filmed it all this
stuff I'll put a link to it in the
description bar below and in the
comments and stuff it's on my second
channel which is called a hunter in a
chaps it usefully log4 it's now called
charts and yeah I've looked the whole
day I've logged the process and I didn't
answer quite a lot of questions in that
video so I'll link it down below I'm not
going to go into as much detail in there
but they've pretty much healed now this
is what they look like and and yeah I
just look though I love them so much
I've had so many compliments on them as
well so thank you to all of you who have
complimented me on like Instagram and
Twitter and so I honestly I'm obsessed
with them so if you want to see like how
I got them like getting them done in the
procedure and stuff like I said that
link will be in the description bar
below I did speak through in that video
about like the pain and the costs and
stuff so I'll touch on that really
really briefly no you don't wanna watch
the whole thing honestly like at my pain
tolerance is very very low and I didn't
have my numbed I chose my I chose not to
have my bike my brows and the skin
around it numbs and it was uncomfortable
but it was bearable and honestly if I
can get it done but if you like a lot of
the people OTT of people tweeting me
saying that like they want theirs don't
know whatever but they're worried about
the pain if I can get it done and I
didn't even have it numbed chose me I
feel like anyone can have it John
because I am such a wasp but like
anything that's like tattoos piercings
anything like that I'm all for she was
really patient with me as well there
were a couple of times like my brows
fine we got through that one like
straightaway my left row in this area
here I started getting quite sensitive
and she was so good she was really
patient with me like I said she's a
really lovely woman so I 100% recommend
er like I said all the links will be
down below if you want to go and like
chapter about it you do have to be
teens get it done I will just say and I
feel like it's not something that you
should get done until you're 18 anyway
because it is a form of semi-permanent
makeup yeah the last for a year you have
a top-up at four to five weeks which I'm
going for in a couple of weeks and then
I do it last for up to 12 months
depending on that your skin and stuff
and how quickly they were off but you
learn about how much it costs it is 250
pounds for the full process so you got
like a patch test and the initial micro
gain like procedure which is why I've
done it two weeks ago and it includes
your um
fortify week top-up which is what I had
going for soon
she's very kindly given me a code as
well for you guys to use in case any of
you are in the Manchester area and you
also want your brows microbe Legion and
the code is just had extra nee you
basically just need to email which I'll
put our email in the description
description bar down below you just need
to email out and just tell her that I
referred yeah I'm not earning any money
of this I don't like it's not an
affiliate link please don't think I'm
trying to like sell you anything or
anything like that because it's not but
if you do genuinely want it doing not
saying how to get it done please don't
sue you are genuinely interested in it

considering doing just need to email her

code hand x-ray in the email and she's
very quick coat replying and very good

support her company because she is such
a lovely woman she was so good with me

and obviously like if I'm happy with the
service and stuff I want to share it
with you guys in case any of you want
the same service I want to recommend the
people that I know are God and
Michelle's amazing so like I said all
the links will be down below along with
the video that I filmed on the actual
day if you've got any questions ask me
up here and yeah I'll put the discount
code down below as well let's just had
an extra day if you want to email
and but yeah that is that that these are
my new brows yeah honestly I don't want
anyone even trying to say that I'm like
trying to sell something or trying to
encourage something because I'm really
not like if you want them do in gray I
completely recommend Michelle if you
don't want them do it it's absolutely
fine like please don't think so house
done it when it's like people comment
stuff like oh my god you're trying to
say that I bailed me said look a certain
way no not I'm really not I use just
something that I wasn't happy with and I
change and know there's other people
that feel the same way about me but if
you don't it's fine I'm gonna put some
music on because let's be honest I can't
get ready with our music what is this
yeah I realize these buns like may be a
bit off centage as well it's bugging me
so don't worry if it's bugging you
because we're just gonna have to get
through the struggle together so to
start with I'm just going to pop some
moisturizer on this is the number 7
beautiful skin day cream I've got for
about three tubs of this now I'm
obsessed and if you have normal to dry
skin they basically do these in all
different like skin types so this one's
normal to dry and it's got like this
pink rim around it you can't really see
and what number 7 do skin care for like
all skin types
and I'm obsessed like if it's my
favorite moisturizer can't ever see
myself using anything else it just oh it
works so I haven't worn proper makeup
like apart from when I filmed my video
the other day
excuse my nails also they really need to
like be redone and you'd a new set of
acrylics but I'm just not at the time to
go yeah I've not really been wearing a
lot of makeup recently because I've been
allowing my brows like time to heal um
and they're just not if I really enjoyed
not wearing makeup I'm not gonna lie I
feel like I've really gone off wearing
like like series like full-on glam
makeup so I'm going to try and create a
look today that's like suitable for like
everyday glam so it's not going to be
like a school tutorial I do have one of
those it's got like no foundation stuff
so I'll link that down below if that's
what you're looking for but we're going
to do like everyday glam today I just
wanted to look naturally beautiful so
let's see how this gold I'm using my
maybe and then aftershave balm as a
primer I try to use this
at the minute just because I have notice
and my paws are beginning to seem a bit
larger than usual I don't know if it's
this I don't know what it is but I know
that this is a particularly good to use
underneath makeup just because it can
clog your skin up so I'm trying to use
it less but and ultimately like it does
it's like my favorite thing to use
because no matter what foundation a pot
on top it always gives the best finish
like my skin just looks below the other
one that I really like is the Too Faced
hangover X primer so if I don't use this
and I'm using that and that is the
extent of my M primary use right now in
case anyone gives a okay foundation
I'm using Makeup Forever HD which I'm
not used for a while on camera but it is
my favorite foundation of all time so
when you use it I'm gonna mix in some of
the honey bronze
what are these drops of Sun body sharp
drop you drop's drop it off this might
be a little bit too dark with my tan so
don't mind that if it is oh no it seems
like it on March yeah let's go go with
it another thing that I don't like about
these Body Shop things is the drop
another works your zones okay I
take that back
I bought well I do want to con but I'd
have to drive down separately wouldn't
know not for a while I want to
achieve I can more of a medium coverage
from this foundation today usually I
like puck it on with a brush but I'm
kind of like trying to like share out a
little bit just cuz I want I want it to
still look like skin you know yeah
foundations make me work on my neck like
come on black feel like that's kind of
like this I mean ya know that'll do
donkey I'll do okay for concealer I'm
going to use Maybelline fit me and 15
I've been really loving this at the
minute it's got a really nice formula
it's like a just melts into the skin
Charlie's right I might use my beauty
blender today I never used up
shall we mix it up a bit wait that back
again I'm gonna put like a bit extra on
because as soon as we using a Beauty
Blender
oh so it's going to acts like absorb
excess anyway I'm just going to like
take it on the lid a little bit as well
just help to like prep for eyeshadow and
whatnot I'm just sketching the under eye
area just like setting the rest of my
face really gently as well I don't want
to let go overboard on the powder today
because I want the skin to look quite
dewy so much it's just like putting a
little bit on the areas where our bronze
because it's important to start areas
that you're going to put other powders
like bronzes and highlighters just so
that they sit nicely on the skin and
then for brows I'm going to like throw
it way back and use the morphe palette
so I'm just going to use like a mixture
of the mutt browns and just create like
a natural fluffy brow something quite
soft and as I said I want this whole
look to be quite soft and just like
flicking the product through I don't
know I kind of wanted like have a
different brow look now that I have
different roles so when I use to fill my
brows in I'd fill in like this whole
area that is now Mike related like on
this side as well so it's like it
doesn't need that anymore I'm still
going to do the tail kind of like this
actually looks a lot softer than pomade
anyway so if you want like if you want
to quite a harsh breath and I feel like
hell mates the way to go I love that on
a star zero one and if you want a softer
ball like this and definitely like
shadow or a pencil eye today but almost
like do eyes or skin first new eyes
first okay cuz I mean we don't want it
too fast the eyes have been a completely
scroll I'm going to give the violet Voss
palette ago and I've used one of these
shadows I
I did not like it it didn't blend very
well at all so I'm going to give it
another go before I completely give up
on it I don't worry as everyone loves
Pelle and I use like two shadows or
something and I just did blend so I was
like morphe 3ho I'm gonna take the shade
um transition which is this one I'm just
going to mix like some of these maps so
we've got transition Bessie pop a little
bit of hashtag in there are you kidding
me you know just mix them all together
okay so far so good so I'm just starting
in the center I'm just bringing it in
and winging it out a little bit here
using like really light pressure just
because I want everything to quite star
I'm gonna use this like bat my eyes
color which has a little bit of shimmer
in which wouldn't usually use in the
crease but I'm just going to mix it up a
bit so I'm going to take that on a 2-1 7
M
no one want to feel like these shadows
just make me work I'm going to wrap it
around the whole eye so I'm going to do
is let's start on the little lash line
and I just want to blend this a bit
bothering me like wing it about here as
well because I want all of it to like
wrap around and tie together
I'm going to just like clean up this
area a little bit with some concealer
okay so this is a pencil bag rimmel it's
there Kate
Shadow sick and the shade is 100 rose
goals I'm going to try it
we'll see yeah quite like that no no I'm
going to take teddy bear and smudge this
on like the upper lash line so I'm going
to put lashes on but I'm not doing a
liner so I just want it to be quite so
all lashes I'm going to use the J make
up by um Lily brushes I want something
quite wispy and so yeah these are really
like fluffy which is exactly what I am
going for okay so I finished off the
eyes I basically put the lashes on which
were the J makeup lashes by Lily lashes
trim the music down then I put some
mascara on the lower lash line of a
little lash line and a lower lashes
sorry and then I highlighted my inner
corner and my brow bone with sin and
highlights about urban decay and that is
the finish I look go for under I'm using
it make up forevers and profusion this
is in the shade two five one they always
have really weird names to like makeup
forever that always like numbers and
letters so that's what it looks looks
alright I'm just going to Brunn's
with my mac 135 I get so many questions
on this brush and bit brushes and
products are always linked in the
description bar so if I don't say what
something is it will be linked down
below but yeah it's incredible for
buttons and it gives a really nice thin
air I do really like this bronzer feel
like it's very natural in the sense that
it just looks like a natural glow like a
nice warm like terracotta shade as well
so gives you skin like a really natural
bronze II bronzy finish Trudi
collarbones should be extra today give
me a call I'm going to use the backer
and Jaclyn hill palette and then I'm
also going to mix in a little bit of sin
just to like make it super pop in I'm
going to use this cute little brush that
I actually tried the other day and I
really like this is a duo fiber fun
brush it by Mac it's a 1h for it's
really cute like
just so well I feel like it blends it a
lot nicer as well like it just makes it
look a lot more airbrush yeah and like
20 minutes course we do shrew you and
cheekbones again not cheap I'm sorry
collarbones so if you want to do your
collarbones guys you basically like put
runs in this area to make the look more
Hollow
and then if you highlight the actual
boat one being so actually let's do
 shoulders and everything like
why not and then blush I am actually
going to put blush on say which I don't
usually do it but soon as this is quite
autumnal and we want it to be nice and
like like plummy rosy sort of colors and
using umber in rose by mark i love this
blush for like often winter time it's
got a really nice sort of um frosty
sheer shimmery finish to it and it's
just like a really nice warm again kind
of like a bronzey terra-cotta shade I
would say so I'm just gonna pop a little
bit on my cheeks to sort of like tie
everything together
I'd actually know where my blush brush
is I'm just doing like a really light
wash like I literally just want it most
like on the apples I brought in three
lip options because I was like I don't
know when a women but they're all
basically the same anyway we've got two
faced sellout which is a melted mark and
sleek birthday to which again is like a
sort of look like the same and then
we've just got Dolce okay bye Kylie well
anyway I'm gonna use a Kylie liner first
because I'm not wrong you're not blot on
the liner Wow nice one hunter
 let's really need sharpen mmm yeah
I'm gonna have to go get a different
light why no one's looking back at it
again I'm going to use staunchly stylish
by Mac we'll see if this works I'm over
joining them a little bit more than I
usually wear today just because I want
some full lips today you know
Dolce sleep right if you want to sleek
one a bit too pink for what I won use
Dolce it
now I'm gonna use this one with this new
face I'm so indecisive oh I love this
color
go choice good choice up
I love the formula of these like they're
quite moisturizing for a liquid lip but
they do not feel dry at all yeah I like
that so this is the finished look I
really hope you guys liked it and it
didn't turn out as daytime as I was
planning it what well that is the thing
when you sit down and put make fun so
I'm going to sort over name this as like
daytime glum you know sort of thing you
can totally wear this on a night out as
well if you wanted to and I mean I
should be happy wearing this daytime or
nighttime it kind of makes it a little
bit more because it's not like got line
or anything it's just like eyeshadow and
then quite a bold matte lip so I really
hope you like it give it a thumbs up if
you did make sure you go and check out
