welcome back today's video is going to
be a makeup tutorial on this look right
here which is kind of like an everyday
an everyday makeup look for yeah I wear
on an everyday basis I don't know it's
not obviously a supernatural look I have
got a supernatural look oh it's not a
supernatural makeup look obviously I've
got lashes on and stuff like that I've
still got like a full face of makeup on
in a sense but it's just something
lighter than what I would usually wear
like there's no wing liner or anything
like that obviously you don't have to
like follow this tutorial exactly how I
do it if you do want to make it like a
natural everyday look than there's tons
of things that you could cut out if you
don't want to apply it as much as I have
I still absolutely love it I feel like
it just looks super flawless but it
still feels really lightweight and
comfortable on the skin sorry about the
light in like I'm using natural daylight
so it's just all over the place so yeah
that's pretty much it boys and girls so
if you want to see how I did this makeup
look then just keep watching ok so the
first thing I do of course would like
any makeup or anything like that is prep
and moisturize the skin so the first
project I'm gonna go in with is the CEO
Sunday Riley moisturizer this is the
moisturizer that I've been using for
quite a few months now I do really enjoy
haunting makeups it's nice and hydrating
and thick and creamy but it doesn't kind
of like make your foundation feel oily
or anything like that well so you have
to excuse me because I actually feel
like I'm still half asleep so the idea
that I've been using is the rodeo
dragons wood I J land this is really
nice it's really hydrating on the Isaac
and I'm pretty sure it contains things
like hyaluronic acid and stuff like that
just to help hydrate and plump the skin
okay and then even though we are gonna
do like a well but I think natural even
though we're gonna do an everyday kind
of look I still like to do my brows
first just because I actually can't do
foundation and like skin before brows
anymore I don't know why it just doesn't
look the same I'm gonna try it a product
that I've not used yeah this is the
benefit full-proof brow powder so it
basically comes in a little container
and then the actual powder is like
shaped with a brow which i think is so
cute
and it does have two tones as well so
it's got one that's slightly lighter
towards the inner part of the brow and
then a darker powder for details like
brow powders look way more natural than
like pro maids and stuff so this is
probably better for everyday compared to
what I usually use which is like beneth
Cabral oh this is in the shade five by
the way so I think this is one of the
darker shades that they do actually oh
my god how is everyone's Valentine's Day
by the way what did you all get up to
yeah me and Kay I swear I was speaking
about this in my actual like Valentine's
Day makeup look put me in Kane
literature straight in and that was it
we watched them survival of the fittest
I don't know if anyone else is watching
it the minute I think it's an ITV I'm
not convinced it's supposed to be like
an oath well like the second love island
sort of thing and I'm just like nah I
don't know I'm not convinced on the
other minute I like that I feel like it
looks quite natural it's just I would
like a little bit of colour and stuff
which is what we're here for
be like they just swap people over too
much like I haven't kept up with every
single episode every night so it's kind
of hard to like keep up with who leaves
who stays the new people stuff like that
because I feel like there's a new person
every single episode started watching
more soaps as well which I never used to
watch like Coronation Street or anything
but Kane always has it on in the
background so you didn't like the darker
shade now I feel like the lighter shades
a bit too like my brows I'm gonna primal
it's not gonna do a lot of eye shadow
but I'm still gonna like do the eyes
first because I will do it lashes so
what I'm going to use to prime is just
heart shape tape and I just mixed the
shades lights and and medium on to eyes
I'm gonna use the Kat Von D shade and
light palette just because I feel like
you can do something fairly not toward
this it's just like all mapped neutrals
I'm going to use mostly the warm section
and then I'm going to use a bit of the
black so I'm just gonna start with this
shade here and this is just a Mac to
tifo I'm just gonna use this in the
crease it's like a little bit of
definition because even when I'm doing
something kind of like natural and like
every day you still want to pop
something in the crease just so there's
like a little bit of definition that you
know I mean I got also I've done so much
or not so much but I've done quite a lot
of like online shopping recently so
there's a hole coming in some day okay
and then I'm gonna go in with the
tiniest bit of like this ready shade
here mix with a little bit at the brown
not a lot at all like I'm not gonna put
much on the brush and it's just to add a
little bit of definition to the outer
corner but I'm just gonna apply like
that much and then just I always pack
for us when I'm doing the outer core
but be like you have to do this by the
way if you literally just want to put
something in the crease or if you want
to start with your skin first or
whatever like you don't have to do it
the exact same as how I'm doing it this
is just like what I like to do and what
I feel suits my face and stuff and like
my eyes and things I'm just gonna take a
eyeliner just a black eyeliner justice
by NYX and it's the retractable eyeliner
in the shade black and it is waterproof
I like this because it's just like yeah
it's retractable so you can just roll it
up and you don't have to worry about
sharpening on sharpening it or anything
like that and I'm just gonna run this
along my tight line I don't go all the
way in I stop like two-thirds of the way
in just because my eyes are like so
sensitive like if I take it to the inner
corner they just freak out so and last
but not least for the eyes I'm just
gonna take a flat definer brush this is
a sigma e 15 and I'm just gonna mix the
black and the brown shade mostly the
black we call this like into my lashes
here so you don't have to do this like
if you're not gonna apply lashes then
you don't really need to bother too much
with this but because I'm gonna use
lashes and obviously I want them to
blend into my natural lashes and stuff I
just use the black to kind of blend my
natural lashes and the fake ones
together and I'm not like doing a wing
or anything but I'm just making it a
little bit thicker on the outer corner
so it's not as harsh as doing like
liquid or gel cuz it's still shut out
okay I'm just gonna curl my lashes and
new mascara and false lashes of course a
scar that I'm going to use is Maybelline
lash sensational probably one of my
favorite drugstore mascaras I don't know
if they do a waterproof version but I
feel like if they did a waterproof
version it would definitely be my
favorite drugstore mascara and then the
lashes I'm going to use they've just got
glue on it a minute but they are the
makeup by Samuel Lily lashes just
because they're super fluttery so I feel
like they just look really pretty on the
eyes and they are bundler so I find them
easier to apply without like heavy eye
makeup where that makes sense because
they're just not got like a super thick
bond compared to other lashes right
under skin I'm gonna go in with the
Smashbox a photo finish primer water I
just love this stuff like it's so good I
can't believe I think I did for so long
just thought it was like pointless
because it's a primer water the
foundation that I like to use for like
everyday makeup is the la girl pro
coverage HD foundation I have this in
the shade natural and it's probably
gonna be too dark quite I do not know
why my tongue does not go dark on my
neck it's just so strange I am but I
love this foundation for a day mostly
because one it's affordable its
inexpensive so you don't feel like bad
to using it on a daily usage if that
makes sense because it's not like it
using a super expensive like bougie
foundation that you don't want to spend
tons of money on Lots if you're not I
mean also because it's really full
coverage what it feels lightweight on
the skin so it's comfortable enough to
wear like long hours throughout the day
but it looks really flawless at the
finish is absolutely stunning like I'm
obsessed with it it's just really dewy
and natural hydrate in things like that
and I just go in with a sponge just to
like soften it all out I'm gonna go in
with a little bit of the L'Oreal
infallible foundation stick just in the
shade toffee and you use this to cream
bronze a little bit you like cream burns
is quite a nice thing to do for like
everyday makeup because it kind of looks
more natural than just powder I think I
don't know why I think it's a cream it
just looks a little bit more natural
than using like just powder if you have
like a good cream bronzer as well like
it doesn't take that long
obviously it's an extra step so you
don't have to do if you don't want to
but as long as you've got a good product
for it shouldn't take you too long to do
and then just go over it with a sponge
right back in with concealer of course
so I'm just using the same top shape
tape under the eyes so I'm just gonna
start with medium and then use a bit of
light Sun just want to be a little bit
more careful when you've done cream
contour not to Jack this too far down if
you want you could do concealer this but
some reason I just got into the habit of
doing friends affairs ok skin is looking
at for Lola if I do say so myself
okay I'm gonna use a bit of Rimmel stay
matte under the eyes as always I always
do this moving inwards so I start here
just move in and then you just want to
do the same with the rest of the skin so
I'm just gonna use the exact same powder
to finish off the under-eye I'm just
gonna blend this kind of peachy shade
again under the eyes and mix in a little
bit of the darker shades at the outer
corner so just using a backstage beauty
i blend a brush and then you just want
to finish off with lower lash mascara so
I'm just using a mini and then I do like
to go in with a little bit of a
highlight on the inner corner just to
tie everything together so I'm just
gonna use a Mac nylon obviously we've
already done cream bronzer so I'm not
gonna do much powder bronzer but just to
kind of set it in place a bit I'm gonna
use makeup forever Pro what brands
fusion which again I love for everyday
because it's waterproof so it stays on
really well and then the highlighter I'm
gonna use the Maybelline at McLean
L'Oreal am crushed foil metallic
highlighter in the shade rose quartz
seen marmor be tweet me recently seen
that you finally found one and picked
one up so I'm glad that people are
finally getting their hands on this it's
just like ridiculous okay last but not
least we've got lipsticks so oh let's
find out I'm gonna use Rimmel lasting
finish lip pencil in the shade tiramisu
I forgotten how much I love these like I
used spice of the day and I just forgot
how much I love them
super creamy they apply really well
don't bleed or anything like that and
obviously with it being Rimmel it's
super affordable and so I'm gonna line
my lips with that and then I'm gonna use
my L'Oreal
in collaboration with balm on urban
Safari lipsticks one of my favourite
news at the Manor Jordan of these are
still available where there are lots of
similar things in the drugstore either
way
and then it last but not least I'm gonna
use to face lip injections in the shade
at milkshake because I'm feeling like a
bit of plump today you know and then of
course we want it to last all day so I'm
just gonna use a little bit of Urban
Decay all nighter this and chill I like
my favorite setting spray Tsavo they're
the only ones that I find actually work
okay so this is the finished look I
really hope you all liked here I know
it's not like technically a sort of
everyday natural makeup look but for me
this is just like a basic simple easy
glam that doesn't take me like too long
to do that I would happily were like for
an everyday kind of thing you know yeah
