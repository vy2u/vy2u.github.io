I've not done anything with my hair what
does that say about me as a person
y'all okay guys it's Han so today's
video is another hacks video because I
was looking through my channel the other
day with my mom as you do and we noticed
that my last hacks video which was like
my 10 beauty hacks video it got more
views than anything else on my channel
like it's my most viewed video so I
figured that you must have enjoyed it
I'm hoping maybe not anyway I wanted to
do another one of these but do a hair
hacks one because I do get a lot of
questions about certain styles that I do
with my hair and just like my hair in
general and I don't tend to do much hair
so but on my channel identic would like
makeup and fashion so I thought be
really fun it just to sit down and share
like my five favorite hacks that involve
hair that I feel like every girl should
know just one make a point of saying as
well I am attempting blog mess this year
so if you did not know I do have a
second channel which I will link down
below and I'll try and put a link on the
screen if I can here as well and if
you're interested then feel free to go
over and have a nosy a1 going up to that
is going to be a lot of store on that
channel that I saw a chat about this
month that I'm not going to announce on
this channel necessarily I think I can
think about these two things probably
that I'm going to talk to people about
on my second channel that I won't
mention here until the new year and so
yeah if you want to know some secrets go
over there and you'll discover them and
I'm honestly just like weird
Roma's hair nails though if you want to
see my five essential hair hacks then
just keep watching
so the first sort of three involve a
high pony because I feel like I've been
so into wearing high ponies at the
minute one because they're just so quick
and easy to do and two because of the
first hack I'm about to tell ya so some
of you might know this but if you do a
high pony and you sort of tie it really
really tight and you scrape all of your
hair back like I usually do it can make
you look like an egg but it also gives
you an instant facelift I'm not even
joking into the way I do a high pony
I tip my help side down I straighten it
first tip my hair upside down and then
brush it and watch my head is upside
down so it all sort of brushes in the
right direction and then I literally
just use my hands to scrape it back as
hard as I can
like I pull on that hair I scrape it
back as much as I can and then I tie it
into a high pony with a bubble I always
make sure that I'm keeping hold of the
pony wash I'm pulling the hair through
because otherwise you sort of lose um
like the slickness and it sort of comes
back through I'm making sense probably
not because like your hat is obviously
pulled back quite tight towards the back
of your head I feel like it just lifts
and the skin especially like on the
upper part like say where your eyes are
and what your brows are I feel like it
just pulls everything back and it really
helps to lift your face yeah that's
another reason why I've been loving
doing it because I feel like everything
just looks so much lifted when I've got
it in a high pony so that is hack number
one the next one is about baby hairs
/ flyaways because I get so many
questions on it I have the worst well
probably not the worst but I have bad
ones my baby has and my flyways honestly
when I scraped my hair back you probably
gonna see in the clip that I've like
film for this and but they're just
flying everywhere like especially the
front where my hairline is they're just
doing the thing they're like frying
around my whole head so I always like to
take some hairspray I feel like this
really completes a slicked-back pony and
you can either use like you can either
spray it directly on your head and then
use your fingers to smooth down your
baby hairs or another thing that I like
to do is either take the comb or a
toothbrush and I don't usually have a
toothbrush spare though so I think in
this clip I'll use a comb and just spray
it the comb with the hairspray and then
use that to sort of flatten all of them
down if you have a good hairspray this
works so well it keeps them in place all
day I have no issues it is really
important and to straighten your hair
first as well because if they like curly
or frizzy then they're probably not
going to stay in place but as long as
you straighten your hair first going in
with some hairspray it really helps to
keep them down and that is how I keep my
slicked pony
it's the lick and then the next one is
for anyone out there who like me has
maybe like a forehead that is a little
bit like a five hat or say for people
who have got really light roots like my
roots for some reason as well there's so
much lighter because I dyed my hair last
Christmas anyway and but naturally my
roots are a lot more like blondish
compared to the rest of my hair so when
I straighten my hair back or I have it
like back in a bun and my forehead just
looks automatically bigger because
roots are lighter and they just don't
look like a hairline if that makes sense
but a good hat for that that I like to
do this really helps to make your
hairline look thicker
it makes your forehead appear smaller
which I always love because for some
reason I think I have a really big
forehead and it also is really good at
blending your bronzer that's on your
forehead see if you apply a lot of
bronzer like I do because I wear fake
tan it's really good at blending your
bronzer on your forehead with your
hairline so there's no like awkward sort
of area where it's just quite pale or
what I like to do is I take my brown
products that I've used and you can't
get specific products for this as well I
think I made for her but I just use my
brow product with it's easier I usually
use eyeshadow for my brows so I will
take whatever eyes shadow I have used
that day and then I take a specific
brush by Mac I don't know what it is but
I shall leave a link to it down below
it's quite a thick dense brush you don't
want anything
and whether shadows gonna like have a
lot of fallout you want something quite
down and then you just take a little bit
of that and you start blending it into
your hairline and honestly I've only
recently started doing this but it's
crazy how much difference it makes it
really helps to just blend everything
together and make your hair look a lot
thicker I'll bet everything in this
video this has to be my favorite one
because I feel like the difference it
makes is insane that it's so simple and
it takes like a minute tops but it just
just so many things in one and then onto
like curly hairstyles and things like
that and my hack for this which is
probably pretty common to be honest as a
lot of these probably because my hair is
really long I'm really thick it is so
hard to keep curls like in place and
have them last at least like a day
whenever I curl my hair I usually kill
it with like a curling Tong like a
heated curling Tong and they usually
last like if I'm lucky a couple of hours
because my hair is so thick it's really
heavy and they just sort of drop out
really quickly so what I like to do now
and it does take a little bit of time
I'll only do it if I really want to put
the other in which it's not
so I wrap my hair around the barrel and
then I don't let it drop I keep it in my
hand until it's cooled and then I take
two bobby pins and I pin it on one end
and on the other end select from the
bottom to the top and then the top to
the bottom just to make sure it stays in
place I used to just do one from the
bottom to the top but it kind of falls
out so it's better to just do two to be
on the safe side she does definitely
date
what the good thing about it is that I
can curl my hair in thicker sections
because it's going to stay in those like
bobby pins as long as I'm getting ready
and so I don't take as much time curling
my hair if that makes sense I just make
sure that they all get in bobby pins and
then I do the rest of my makeup and then
when I come to take them out at the end
they look a lot more voluminous they've
kept a shape better and they last so
much longer especially if you just wash
your hair and I feel like it's really
difficult to keep curls in place when
you've just wash your hair because
obviously it's really fresh and clean
and it just wants to like slip away so
that's a really good one and just make
sure that you kills stay in place and
they stay nice and bouncy and pretty and
voluminous and then I just hairspray
them and whilst they're in the bobby
pins and then basically tease them
afterwards I like to just backcomb them
with a brush and usually a tangle teezer
and then I just apply some dry shampoo
to the roots to make sure that they're
not too flat compared to the rest of my
hair and then I take some Bumble and
Bumble dry sport finishing spray I spray
that through it's like a magic bat stuff
it makes you have so sort of like fluffy
and thick and voluminous especially for
like long heavy hair and and then just
hairspray it again and I feel like it
lasts so much longer I can wear it all
the way through the night I wake up the
next morning and my curls are like even
though they're a lot looser they're
still in place compared to if I was just
to curl them with the hot iron and let
them drop they will not last it's a
minor moving on it to the last one this
is good for anyone with short hair so I
just talked about one that I like for
long hair and I still do this anyway
even though my hair is quite long but
it's basically a way of making your
ponytails look longer just doing the
ponytail in like two or three sections
so in the clip I show you doing it in
three sections to make it look extra
long the more sections you do the longer
it's going to look I just take the
bottom section of my hair and take it
quite low down and on the back of my
head just so that we keep the length and
then you just want to do at the top or
the middle I think I usually do the top
first just to make sure that it's all
nice and script back and it looks really
pretty and then I do the middle section
after that and just having it in three
different sections on different places
on your head obviously you've got the
high pony that's like the first pony
right the top of you has so it
looks like a really high pony but then
because you've got the low section as
well it makes it look really long what
you want to do after that is then just
backcomb it or so I'll have a play
around it because you don't want to be
able to see that you've got multiple
ponies in obviously you want to look
like one so I just like to backcomb it
and make it look really voluminous and
make sure that all of the bubbles apart
from the very top one are covered and
then that just makes it look all as one
piece that's like a really long ponytail
so those were all the hacks I really
