say like happy Tuesday Sunday Thursday I
don't know why don't floating there so
high so for today's haul we're doing
something a little bit different okay I
didn't choose this haul I didn't pick
any of the clothes in this haul I left
it all up to you guys
so I basically asked on Twitter for you
guys to tweet me with some clothes and
stuff that you wanted to see me try on
and I picked some out you guys honestly
tried playing me with some of these
suggestions honestly there was one piece
of clothing in particular I've just been
back on the tweet and it's got 22
favorites I wish I bought it now it was
basically a pair of like really short
denim shorts they were like I think they
were actually called nikka shorts which
just says it all I'm sorry to pick them
up honestly I wish I had no because I
didn't realize how many people it's got
like 22 favorites which is more than any
of the other pieces of clothing so I'm
sorry I didn't get those they would have
just not been wearable anyway so yeah I
went ahead and picked some things up
this is actually the first piece I'm
wearing it right now I'm modeling it hi
you so much to everyone who suggested it
clothes as always I'm really sorry that
I obviously combined them all that would
have been a lot of money and a long haul
so I'm pretty sure this was suggested by
a girl called Ella this is actually one
of the first pieces that I picked up so
I've just been back on the tweet though
and the one that she's taking a picture
up and sent to me is actually rad so
it's the exact same t-shirt dress but
it's red instead so I don't know how
I've managed to get a pink one we all
know I'm not the brightest of sparks so
this is basically a t-shirt dress I have
got a Tryon clip as well so that you can
see it on but I'm obsessed with this
Ella you picked a good piece here so as
you can see it's just really big and
slouchy and loungy loungy is not a word
I'm obsessed with this I love the color
of it I love the whole vibe of it I am
loving loving t-shirt dresses again at
the minute you guys know if you've seen
like my old og halls t-shirt Jess's that
honestly just my thing I love them I
love that they're slouchy I love that
you can just throw them on I love that
they don't get you to like you're not so
hot in them in the summertime you can
wear them with trainers like little
heels anything but yeah Ella thank you
for picking this out because I
absolutely love it so this next piece I
want to do this one next because quite a
few people asked for these so these were
picked out by Noir Abbey and I
believe there was one other person these
are black pinstripe casual trousers
these are not what I expected when I saw
them in the photo so first of all first
of all I do it really love the style of
these I love the fact that they're black
with white stripes you guys know I'm
usually all black everything like I'm
obsessed the waist bands are really nice
it really squeezes you in at the waist
which you guys know I love that I love
such ways and give it to me there are
really nice length as well I think what
threw me off with these is that the
materials and not white expected so
there are a little bit thinner than I
expected I've had it quite a few pairs
of trousers from pretty little things
and these are kind of like you know that
fabric that's just really light and airy
and you can wear it in summer and it
just feels really lightweight because
it's black because I've black like
they're not to see through which is good
so I just didn't expect them to be so
thin it's kind of that material as well
it because it's a bit on the thinner
side it creases really easily so these
are like super super crease so I'm kind
of in too much I like them and I feel
like for a casual outfit they'd look
really cute and I feel like in this
summer if you wanted a pair of trousers
for the summer these would be really
good cuz a super thin and just
lightweight so I'm in two minds you tell
me tell me in the comments because I
will have put a Tryon clip in so tell me
what you think I do like them but
they're just not what I expected them to
be okay on to a playsuit this was picked
out by Elizabeth and also by tummy
except tummy picked out the black one
but yeah this is just a playsuit it's
white and then it's got kind of like
blue embroidery all down the breast area
and then down into the shorts as well
have to say when I first put this on I
was so confused because the waist is
like a drawstring but it's just so not
obvious so when I put it on it seemed
like there was just no shape to at all
but when you kind of pull the waist in a
little bit it does actually really come
together and look like a really nice
outfit thing I'm not sure I'm from my
body is how much of a plunge is that you
can see here how much is exposed in this
okay
it's not as bad like it's not as open
once you've pulled the waist in and kind
of tied it a little bit it does copier
and I did feel safe in it but I don't
know like if it's right for my body or
not I don't know if it suits me if that
makes sense
it's got bell sleeves which I'm
so obsessive like I love the whole vibe
and for me this is such like a summer
holiday outfit I feel like it looked
really cute with the pair of sandals so
again I'm in two minds because the
plunge is like a little bit more than I
would usually do but maybe I should step
outside my comfort zone for once maybe
okay on to another place ooh this is
again white this wasn't suggested and
picked out by Vicki so hi Peggy this is
quite a different vibe to the last one
which I really like it's more of kind of
like what would you explain this as it's
just kind of like textured and pattern
like all over the place suit which I
really like it's got a little lace up at
the center which again I absolutely love
and it's a Bardot situation so you've
got little sleeves that your arms took
into it there and then it does have a
zip at the back and all in all what was
the price difference that we see
actually there's almost 28 pounds I'm
not entirely sure how much the other
place it was because I've cut the price
off the screenshot and but this one
feels a little bit more high quality
this one definitely feels a little bit
thicker it feels just like more there's
more going on when it's on it's not the
biggest end so I like the fact that it's
got a zipper at the back because it
means you can when you zip it all up
like it really just sucks everything in
and one thing I have to say that I do
like about this which I don't find very
often the fact that it's like a bar
doughnuts sleeveless hair it actually
fits my boobs right like it's not too
big or too small it just fits perfectly
got like that sticky texture at the top
as well so you know that it's gonna kind
of adhere to the skin a bit and you
boobs are gonna be safe they're not
gonna be popping out anywhere again I
feel like it's just a cute holiday
outfit like a white place ooh you can't
go wrong on holiday okay onto something
a bit different this was picked out by
Casey so hello I'm gonna have to ask you
guys to pick stuff up more often because
I feel like you've picked out things for
me that I wouldn't necessarily think to
buy myself but when they've arrived I do
actually really like them so this is
kind of like a blazer situation I'm not
gonna join up why am I like this I don't
know I have got to try and click fit
though so you'll see it in there it's
basically just like a black it's kind of
like a silky material just a long blazer
and then it's got gold buttons three
either size and you can tie it at the
waist as well I have to say in the Trion
clip I feel like I didn't do it justice
with the way I tied it because I tied it
in a bow and when I look at the photo
from the website when it's on the model
they just do it in a knot and it looks
way better because when I tried it on I
really liked it but at the same time I
was like something about it doesn't look
right and I think it's just the way that
I tied the waistband but it feels really
nice it feels really soft the buttons
I'm not like obsessed with I feel like
the gold button so a bit plasticky in a
bit cheap but it's what it is at the
whole vibe though I think it just looks
really sexy and cool and it's not
something like I would not think to get
something laser ass so I'm really glad
that Kate you suggested this because
like I said it's not something I think
to buy but once it was here and I tried
it all like I could really see it
working and I feel like with a pair of
cigarettes houses or something and a
pair of black heels you just look like a
botanist like a boss bitch you know oK
we've got another pair of trousers these
were picked out by Taylor so again these
are kind of like a black these are like
a cigarette bye-bye probably sure to try
these on with the Blazer although it's
got contrast stitching so it probably
won't have match and but these are just
a pair of black cigarette trousers as I
just said ci is all roughly at the top
which I have mentioned in past videos I
really like this style at the minute
with waists puns and stuff and like the
way situation being a bit roughly I
think it looks really cute so yeah it's
black and then it's got all white
contrast stitching on the bell and the
pockets and things like that
these are actually really cute I'm the
thing that I like about these is the
quality is really there but these are
actually really good quality that really
thick I like the fact that they're very
high waisted so they go past my belly
button which I'm all for I love a good
high-waisted trouser pockets a queue and
they're a nice amount of tapered like
everything about them is just really
nice you know they're really good for
really good quality 10 out of 10 a star
I like these okay next up we've got a
body suit this was picked out by ballet
X so I've seen a couple of body suits on
pretty little thing that are this kind
of color scheme so they're like a peach
color and then they've got all white
hems this one's a little bit different
so it kind of has some little cutouts in
the very center and then it goes into a
v-neck pant of body suit
one thing I'll say about pretty little
thing a body suits they're actually not
too short I find that that a lot of them
maybe not all of them are okay
lengthwise especially compared to
misguided I don't know if misguided has
got any better because
I just gave up on that bodysuits this
broke my heart okay because the fabric
is just so thin the quality is just not
there I can't remember how much it was
everything will be linked down below for
what it's worth it's just not worth it
does that make sense yeah it was just a
bit thin the quality compared to some of
the others job considering so many of
the other things such as such good
quality it this kind of let me down a
bit but something tells me like it
wasn't that expensive so maybe that's
why oh yeah okay it was ten pounds it
was somehow still fair enough ten pounds
for a body suit is pretty affordable and
I feel like if you put a bra on you
could probably make it work but all in
all like it just feels a little bit thin
and I think the cut of the neckline
doesn't really suit me either but yeah
it's a shame because the color I
absolutely love I think the color is so
cute and I think it's really summery um
yeah but you got what you pay for it's
ten pounds so that's what you have to
bear in mind okay on to a jumpsuit you
guys know I love a good jumpsuit I think
there so far but this was picked out by
Caitlyn so this honestly I had such high
hopes for this because when I saw the
screenshot that Caitlyn's weird of this
like it just looks so cute it's
basically just a sort of nude stone
color and then it's got white pinstripes
all down it it goes into like a wide-leg
situation and then the top half is quite
a low v-neck I guess kind of like a
plunge situation guys there's no
adjustable straps so you already know my
opinion on this if this is hard
adjustable straps okay I probably would
have kept this because I love the style
of it I love the vibe of it I think it's
so cute Caitlyn actually mentioned that
she's debate in and getting this for a
party so I feel like I need to be on it
instantly a little bit see-through
is what I will say you could definitely
see the sort of texture or like imprint
of my underwear line so just something
to bear in mind also it was way too
low-cut for me like to the point where
my nipples were nearly like popping out
to say hello if it had adjustable straps
however we probably wouldn't have that
problem so pretty little thing hi I feel
like it's personal tastes like if you
don't mind the fact that it's to plunge
then you'll probably enjoy it I'm gonna
have to send this back because it
doesn't work for me
but I do love it and quite sad that its
cargo so the very last piece was
suggested and picked up by Molly so she
sent me a screenshot of the gray one but
I'm pretty sure they didn't have it in
my size at a time so I picked up the
kind of nudey pink one instead which was
like more like one of the newer colors
because a lot of them are actually sold
out of these so it's basically just a
cropped ripped what would you describe
this as a peach rib zip front long
sleeve sweater okay so it's basically a
cropped like high neck ribbed sweater so
this I actually do really like the style
of the materials not what I expected to
be it kind of feels more of like a
sporty material if that made sense like
it's not super soft it is soft but it's
not like cardigan soft if that makes
sense the neck is really nice it's nice
and high I like that you can zip it open
and just how kind of like zip top you
won it the length is really nice it's
not too short not too long all in all
like I just really like the fit of it I
don't know what I'll wear it with yet
but I think it's just like a really cute
piece I wish they'd had the white one in
stock as well because the white one
looked really nice but a lot of these
were sold
owl so yeah thank you to Molly for
picking the Alex I do actually really
like this I think that's everything that
I picked out for this video
I wish I bought those shorts now like I
wish I bought the denim maker shorts
because that would have just been
absolutely hilarious if you do want to
see another one of these videos let me
know in the comments what brand do you
want to do and make sure you follow me
on Twitter if you want to be involved in
the next one my house like all over the
place
sorry thank you so much to all of you
that picked some clothes out and sent
them to me for this video I'm so glad
that I've done this video because I feel
like you've suggested stuff that I maybe
wouldn't have thought to buy but I
actually really like I'm gonna get going
anyway because I'm actually running late
for a dress fitting appointment which I
hate running late so thank you so much
for watching I love you guys as always
to the moon and back and I'll see you in
the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
