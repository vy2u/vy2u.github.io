happy Thursday today's video is going to
be a little bit different rather than
doing a full face we're basically just
going to be concentrating on the skin
today I'm so annoyed because I've tried
a new eyelash glue I've tried the house
of lashes lash glue sorry this is a
complete side note a second and I'm
pretty sure my eyes are allergic to it
and now these lashes are just like not
cooperating articles I thought I'd set
myself a challenge in today's video and
basically try and create a flawless base
and full coverage like skin look with
products that come to under 30 pounds
that was a bit of a mouthful so yeah
every single product that we're going to
use for the skin today is hopefully I'm
pretty sure it comes throughout 29
pounds and 50 pages so we're pushing the
boundary but it's all going to be under
30 pounds so lots of cheap affordable
drugstore products we all love a good
bargain some of these I've used before
and absolutely love and then some of
them I'm kind of testing out to see if
they work if I like them and things like
that so I'm excited to get into it and
share some products with you Oh No
okay this lashes got to come off I swear
I've heard so many good things about
House of lashes lash glue which is why I
bought some obviously and wow that's
just created such a hot mess why is
like this gotta happen to me okay back
home to the actual video best product
we've got to use is a product I've not
tried before this is the makeup
revolution a pro base aqua primer base
spray so you guys know I absolutely love
my Smashbox primer water it's one of my
favorite primers ever so I'm hoping this
is gonna be like a similar vibe you know
so I'm just gonna spritz this oh it's
quite a nice miss oh it smells like
roses okay a lot comes out if you like
the spray the suspense is it really far
as well so it's like in my hair and
everything it feels like tacky which is
nice I always look for tacky primer that
is six pounds by the way so that's
starting off our 30 pound budget and
then for foundation this I have tried
before and I've used quite another drop
that I have uses quite a few times now
this is the
more breathable medium coverage 25-hour
blah blah next to this I first used in
my testing jokes or makeup video which
I'll put on the screen here here put on
the screen here if you've not seen it
already and I've used a couple of times
since and so far I'm really enjoying it
you just have to make sure you blend out
quite well that's the only thing I'll
say so the shades that I've got our 203
true beige and 400 natural beige so I'm
going to use mostly the light Wednesday
because my faith hunt
is kind of gone so I'm just gonna go
ahead and apply this to the skin the
thing that I like as well is the fact
that it actually has like a cute dough
for applique and then I've been using it
with a Beauty Blender so that's how I'm
gonna blend it out today it blends out
so fast this foundation that you really
don't need to do a lot of work like for
it kind of does all the work for you is
what I'm trying to say yeah that
actually matches quite well so a little
bit dog but we can just you know blend
down the neck so that is one side of
like one layer and that is nothing firm
medium coverage I feel like it's
definitely more medium to fall like I
just love this applicator I mean it's
probably a bit on high genic because you
kind of putting it on your face and then
back in but my face is always like clean
when I apply makeup i always cleanse it
first so yeah the coverage is really
nice it does build really well as well
which I'll show you in a minute I do
like to go in with a little bit more on
my cheeks just gonna do the neck a
little bit cuz it's a tiny tiny bit and
uh this is just not cute angle likewise
this honestly okay so that is the
coverage so far which for me is fine um
it feels really thin on the skin feels
really weightless I'll put a little bit
more on my cheeks head just so you can
see how it felt if you can see what it
just melts in so quickly but you don't
have to do any hair I've had to try this
with a brush like this I don't know how
it works with a brush but with a sponge
I really like it for concealer I am so
excited because I'm finally gonna try
out the makeup revolution conceal and
define full coverage concealers these
have been so hyped and so raved about so
I'm really excited to get these ago I
picked up the shades c5 c6 on
seven and that kind of brand-new because
like c6 even though it's the middle
shade that I got it's way lighter than
the other two so I'm gonna try c5 and
see seven maybe I was in super chill
today and then that's so many of you
guys so if you came over and said hi to
me while I was in traffic today hi thank
you for saying hi alright so this is C
sub n let's have a look see what she
looks like oh okay that could work quite
well
oh it feels really smooth like really
smooth oh my gosh oh wow I heart even
explain the texture it feels like really
cooling you know if you put like aloe
vera on I know that makes no sense but
it just feels so smooth thought the
applicator would be like the same as tar
shape tape and it is similar but it's
not quite the same it's a little bit
smaller and lighter in my opinion right
so I've just gone on top with a little
bit of c5 and I don't even know if you
can see the difference because honestly
on the skin they look basically
identical oh wow Wang oh my gosh
God blended out so easily definitely is
like kind of medium to fall oh so much
better than the first concealer I tried
by then like I don't know if anyone
remembers that testing video but that
concealer was like oh wow that is so
pretty like so pretty
geez I'm sorry but this is just like
smooth everything about this look so far
is like 10 out of 10 if I do say so
myself so that was four pounds which
means but on 19 pounds the powder that I
picked out for the entire face is the
Rimmel stay matte as you can see this
has been loved by me it's hit pan I've
not actually used this in quite a while
now because I just kind of forgot about
it for some reason I don't know why but
this is a really good powder I think
it's four pounds or like three pounds 50
or something like that and the shade
that I have is translucent because I
don't like any sort of color in a powder
I draw
it was kind of translucent transpiring
any bark okay so I'm just gonna take
some on a brush I'm just gonna step
under my eyes I you see this a lot like
both under my eyes and all over the skin
like I don't know if you can see but
it's made the under eye so much smoother
which is what I always loved about it so
that is where I've sat and then I don't
know if you can tell but this is like
still just just the concealer oh I
forgot how much I love this powder like
I don't know why I don't use it more
after okay one thing I do really like
which I'm not going to use in this video
because it doesn't fit into the things
it takes us a little bit over and but I
will use it and like my next get ready
with me or something like that so that
you can actually see it on the skin this
is the barium liquid chrome highlighted
drops these I just want to say I do
really like these because I feel like
I've had quite a few questions on them
when they first came out the shade that
I use is being meet up and I do really
like them but you just have to be
careful how you apply them like I would
not apply these over powders they just
don't sit right on top of powder that my
son's like they just don't blend well
and but just on top of like liquid
foundation they look really lovely
um they give a really quite high shine
finish for the liquid highlight in my
opinion and they kind of pair really
well with powders because they just make
them pop more so I'll use that in my
next quick get ready with me I'll use
that in my next video but I'm not gonna
use it stakes it won't fit into the
thick pan budget I'm sorry but just let
you know it was I feel like some of you
guys have asked about these and they are
seven pounds so they're pretty
affordable anyway I'm just gonna set the
whole skin the whole skin the whole face
I'm just gonna use it Rimmel stay matte
over everything for bronzer this is kind
of like a jewel I mean you could just
use this and make it even cheaper it
comes like 26 pounds but I am going to
use another product afterwards this is
the makeup revolution ultra scott ultra
sculpt and contour kit in ultra light
medium so I remembered using this in my
makeup revolution testing video I think
I did anyway or did I actually I know I
definitely bought it for it but I can't
remember if I actually used it that's
quite dark now actually looking at here
but a while in general I do really like
and this little pallet is only three
pounds 50 which in my opinion for a
console shade kind of like this is
supposed to be a blush herb I'd say it's
more like a bronzer on my skin and then
a highlighter I think that's really good
I don't know if you can tell but this is
probably a bit too dark for me right now
but I'm going to use it anyway and just
go in with a really light hand I might
mix in a bit of the blush
oh no the blush is like orange not
orange but it's a bit born probably it's
not actually that bad
so I'm literally just tapping in like so
and then tucking off and then I also
just wipe a little bit on my arm just to
cut off any excess product a good thing
about a palette like this as well is
that you could use this as a shadow and
browse to so say if you wanted to make
this super affordable
obviously I've used different products
like my eyes and my brows my lashes and
things but you could have just done the
skin you see concealer as a base for the
eyes and then you could just use this in
the crease the blusher or the
highlighter on the lid use this in your
brows like depending on what brown color
you are of course I could have used this
in my brows so if you want to make it
even more affordable that's a little tip
I'm just gonna go in with my nose eat a
brush and a tiny little bit like you
need the tiniest bit of this powder this
bronzer even and I'm just gonna lightly
do a little nose situation I don't
really contour my nose you can't really
call it that I just kind of put a bit of
bronzer so it doesn't get lost on my
face okay for highlighter I am actually
gonna start with this one in the palette
but I just got another product as well
because I wanted like a blinding glow
for the S but should be fair you could
just use by itself because I mean it's
pretty I feel like it's a little bit
like my skin like it's a tiny bit too
icy but and then I did actually got a
separate product for highlighter this is
the MUA Luc's blow locks loops I don't
know bubblebeam a highlighting powder in
the shade gold because I saw Holly Boone
use this in her mu a testing video if
anyone follows Holly I'll link the video
down below if you've not already seen it
make sure you go and check it out
because it is a really interesting video
and there was lots of hits and misses
but this product looks so good on a skin
like
looked insane and I went on the super
drug websites check it out and it's
actually only two pounds fifty which for
a highlighter for any product in general
that is so cheap I'm pretty sure it is
on sale now like it used to be five
pounds but it's now two pound fifty i
swatched a cashmere in the shop which is
quite an interesting like pinky movi
color and which just one of looked good
on my skin tone but the actual formula
felt really good so I thought I'd pick
it up in the shade gold and I'm pretty
sure this is the same shade Hollie use
typing hmm not so just gonna like go in
a little bit cuz I feel like that's a
bit too bright I really like that like
that looks so blind in loose powders are
actually really good you just have to be
careful how you use them because they
can either go on like too intense or
just look a little bit busy and not
blend as well as long as you like work
with them and stuff and kind of learn
how they work on your skin they kind of
look really good but yeah that is the
skin completely finished I don't use
blush if anyone's gonna learn obviously
you could add in a blush if you wanted
to but it is not something I usually
wear all of this came to 29 pounds
because that was two pound fifty I
believe I think I don't know I'm just
gonna quickly finish off my under-eye on
my lip and stuff I'm gonna do that off
camera but I will link all of the
products down below that I've used for
lashes and stuff like that I'll be back
in a minute okay so this is the finished
look I have to say I'm absolutely
obsessed if you like my skin just just
not look this good in ages I don't know
what it is but I just feel like
everything it looks really put together
all of the products look like worked
really well together what I'm trying to
say my under eyes look super smooth I
forgot how much I love the Rimmel stay
matte powder cuz honestly that really
does make you under a little up but it
makes you under house look so our brush
and so smooth I don't think I have
anything else to say so I'm gonna get
going but thank you so much for watching
if you still watching to this point let
me know in the comments what other
videos you'd like to see because
obviously I would love to know but other
than that I love you guys the moon about
a million times over and I'll see you in
at Sunday's video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
