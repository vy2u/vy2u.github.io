to be a first impression in the video on
this makeup right here I've literally
just finished it it just exactly enough
just on the outro for this video and
honestly this video was interesting
because I had many issues with this
makeup look it wasn't necessarily the
products but it was just me being
absolutely incapable of applying them
mostly there was so many times to this
video I was just like I cannot do this
like I kind of finish this look because
I was getting so frustrated and but now
that it's actually done I really do
quite like it I feel like it's really
pretty for like spring/summer time
pretty much just like a copper like
burnt orange
I very like easy and natural and nothing
to have you on the eyes and then just
like skin and just like a sort of rosy
reddish lip so I really hope you all
like it it is like I said a full face of
first impression so I do let you know my
thoughts and my final verdict on
everything at the end but yeah if you
want to see how I achieve this makeup
and what I tried out today then just
keep watching got like so many little
friends on my father at the Rinella
don't know going on thought we were past
it I honestly did so I'm just going to
moisturize when I start with skin
because like I don't want to do anything
too heavy on the eyes today just using
my number 7 and daily was called like
beautiful skin day curry and then for
primer we've got the is it called Galan
I think that's how you pick sorry I've
got like a half this is the Galan more
what is called basically it's the gold
primer and which I showed in my beauty
haul when I did like this ROM little and
stuff like a high-end BT haul and I'm
not trying it yet but if I was going to
do a full bit on it but it is just a
primer so I'm just going to include it
in this instead I've heard really good
things about it so I am optimistic can
God my hair gets everywhere okay I'm
just going to like pump some ow oh my
god it's so cool you can see like the
flakes of gold so extra smells is very
fragrant
the most fragrant primer of ever use my
god it feels like like jelly like jelly
water okay and then before we go over
the foundation I got some of the cover
FX custom enhancer drop season like the
illuminating ones and this one is in the
shade sunlight I'm hoping it's going to
be pretty so I'm just really apply that
on the skin and I've seen a lot of
people doing this on Instagram videos
recently
I'm also shake well before you say yeah
I feel like you can mix it in with
foundation and use it on its own I would
admit I will lllll and what mix it in
with foundation today but we're using a
stick foundation so I don't really see
how that's going to work so I'm just
gonna whoo pretty I'm worried it's just
going to be quite dry like my issue in
the liquid illuminated is if they kind
of dry so I don't want it to do that
because I'm going in with like Korean
foundation so I need my skin to be like
this hydrated as possible oh my god that
is like obviously went in with too much
nice land Hannah which will just change
the color of my face just with those
jobs oh my god they were obviously too
dark I can take what I like basically
the reason there ways to use them
underneath because the foundation reason
is the unsub you stick foundation and
this is in the shade of beige and I
believe it's like a satin to matte
finish which is why I want is like
something like this underneath slide the
stick foundations directly to the center
of the forehead over cheekbones bridge
of the nose and jaw line use a fluffy
synthetic brush or a damp sponge to
blend oh man it has pro tip that
actually coverage use a small brush and
work directly off the stick which is
what I'm going to do because I've always
found that stick foundations work better
when you use them directly from step so
far I've never had a stick foundation
that I haven't liked so let's not start
here not just pretty good so a ton of my
neck of the minute is like wearing on so
don't mind me and you slide get a bus
tonight and really exfoliate very like
dry like when i'm swatching out on my
skin it doesn't feel anything
the hourglass one or the makeup for
everyone like it feels dry definitely
has like a go to coverage to it though
yeah it's got a really nice coverage
it's definitely looking like full I mean
I'm kind of swiping and blending with
the brush as well so I'm a playing like
a fab it can I blend it down my neck
because my neck is atrocious today just
going to do a little bit because I'm so
over looks okay it just is like such a
dry stick which I mean is great for
people who are you know like oily skins
but for me when I'm kind of like normal
to dry okay for now but I just wonder
what it'd be like in a couple of hours
or when we set the face and things and
then I would say for our concealer I
thought I would try the amazing
cosmetics amazing concealer and this is
in the shade light golden and I don't
know I just it's 400 and the shop they
don't really know if you can use this
under the eyes but I did buy it with the
purpose of having it for under the eyes
and I saw a couple of people comment
about this because it was also in the
hall with the primer and basically
saying that it's just super full
coverage and just to use a little bit so
like what I'm going to do and I'm going
to make sure I use a Beauty Blender
which I will go and jump in it now and
back at it again I know the foundation
is looking all right I'm probably just
like being judgmental because I'm you
see even my makeup for everyone but it
is looking nice doesn't look too dry I
guess it just felt dry like I wasn't
used to the feeling of it okay we'll
start with that much Sun just : you
don't get it too up crease a little bit
already which isn't a great time I'm
going to accept it with asti ma I don't
have a new loose Pattison screaming this
line okay so can okay right now we'll
see how it goes and it definitely has
creased a bad bit but I mean nothing
crazy so again we'll just see by the end
of the video before I set the face I'm
going to do a little bit of cream
console because Anastacio basically I
have a bunch of Anasazi products Charlie
could be very kindly sent a PR package
over and so this is the console
kits into the shade light and it just
looks like so I've always wanted
these because I do quite like cream
Brunson and cream contour and stuff so
we'll see how it goes and I'll show you
to use I'm going to start with this
shade which is the shade Java so I'm
just going to take it oh yeah they're
very cool
shifting Kohl okay hey we'll start with
that much taking a little bit of work to
blend out usually I would like cream
bronze with my makeup for a stick and
again it was blend a little bit easier
than this is blending I'm not gonna lie
quite a set cream I expected them to be
a little bit creamier but they are quite
sick they don't really blend like if you
just pop them you have to kind of swipe
them around which I don't really love
doing because I feel like it Community
Foundation and but they don't really
just blend but I like dabbing motions
you kind of posture like swipe okay so
now that it's fairly blended and it
looks nice it definitely is quite cool
tone so that's just something to bear in
mind feel like some areas aren't like
majorly blended so I'm sorry if they're
not but I have done my best today I'm
just going to quickly set the face so
I'm just going to use Rimmel stay matte
just because I don't have aiming powder
okay so I'm going to start with brows
and I'm going to use the Anastasia brow
definer I've tried the brows but I've
never child trilha tried this so this is
in the shade dark brown and we're going
to get this to go I'm hoping that I'm
going to like it because it's the same
sort of like shape as my goof proof
pencil back benefit but just comes with
a little spooley so I'm just going to
use that to brush the hairs or not
really been like using a lot of product
in my brows recently I've pretty much
just been using pencil and that's it so
I'm hoping this is going to be like as
good pencil to stick with this is in the
shade dark brown really itchy nose so I
pretty much just fell a little bit
underneath the brow and then I do a
little bit at the front and that's it
I just sort of fill it in like darkness
pets was really nice it's nice and
creamy good pigmentation yeah pretty
much this reminds me of like my benefit
one oh my god that brow is perfect and
this one's not thrown I I'm really like
it's really good and then we're just
going to set them with the clear brow
gel and again by and Slavia I've heard
again
so many good things about this and I've
always wanted to give it a go so it just
looks like so just going to pull it
through I mean you're not really going
to see too much difference because it
pretty much is just like a clear gel and
but hopefully it will keep them in place
again really nice if anything the brush
is a tiny bit too big for my personal
preference and the stickers I'm using
the benefit goof proof and has a really
small brush and if you like you can
really get in like nooks and crannies
but it does the job it keeps me in place
makes them look nice and fluffy so I
don't really have any complaints there
so the eyes I'm so excited because I've
literally not even open this and like
properly swatch it yet this is the hata
beauty textured shadows color in the
rose gold edition so we're going to give
this a go today like I said I don't
really want to do it in oh don't mind me
I don't want to do anything too dramatic
so if you want to see another lot quar
do something dramatic then let me know
but I just kind of want to test out and
also like the maps and then the texture
shadows in this video today so this is
what it looks like I'm going to start
off with the color shy and then I'm
going to mix it sorry privacy it's gonna
hair which is shy it's kind of like a
baby movie pink and then also sandalwood
down here and it's going to kind of mix
them together and see how it go with wow
that's pigmented barely touch the pan
with the brush so a lot of like comapre
gonna like wrap it underneath as well
I'm just using the same brush because
it's kind of want it to be a little bit
blown out that concealer has creased as
well kind of badly so I want to bring it
down a little bit more and I usually
would now I'm going to use a tiny bit of
henna which is
slightly darker and a little bit more
warmer like a terracotta shade I'm just
going to use a tiny bit of that as well
yeah that concealer is not made for me
honestly not a sort of like I will not
be using that again okay and then on the
lid I'm going to try Trust Fund which is
here and I'm pretty sure with these
textured shadows and you supposed to use
your fingertips
yeah they deliver that maximum payoff
with fingertips they are really chunky
like really really chunky so it kind of
worries me a little bit like how much
fallout we're going to get a little bit
then I'm just going to try and sweep it
away to be honest Trust Fund and rose
gold which are like the one I'm using
and the one next to it look the chunk
yes whereas some of the others don't
look as bad because honestly like
majority of this is falling on fluffy
stick in which is not very well I feel
like you'd have to use some form of like
shadow primer or like shadow glue for
these ones because they are so foiled
like there's like specks like they're
not really sticking or blending okay so
it's not wiping away from under my eyes
even though I set it
ah I just love it when this happens
now they don't blend with a brush after
all literally stuck to my under I like
it won't move like it just will not
budge off my skin even I've set my face
like I've never had an eye shadow
refused to wipe away after I've set my
under eye my face it's going to move on
to liner because I'm not going anywhere
today so I don't need it to look that
perfect like if I was going out I
genuinely would probably remove a little
bit of my concealer and redo it but like
it doesn't look that obvious and you
can't really see it on camera and like
far away so we're just going to leave it
for eyeliner I found this in my draw
this is the rebel eyes gel liner by Mac
I got this a long time ago when I used
to work at mark it came in like one of
the what was the word
I'm we've got an update and you've got a
little goodie bag at the end and it came
in one of those one time so basically
what you do is basically a gel liner in
a pen form
so you twist it up just take them while
you twist it up and then the product
comes out and it looks like so so if I
swatch it that such a bad swatch but you
can kind of see but it's so thick I'm
like how is anyone supposed to
anything with this oh my god this is
actually a joke like it's so this is all
this is all fall guys I feel like crying
and just stop in this tutorial right now
and what even is that someone help me
what is that I even tried to like angle
it and like use lighter pressure so it
would feather out and it's just not
happening oh my god I've never done such
a bad wing loner and while I'm giving up
to know I don't know from me I'm just
going to go in with liquid liner instead
and just try and like say don't Johnny
and so that liquid liner is just
all over that okay and then for lashes I
have these by Amber Rose these are in
the style toffee so I thought I would
give them a girl they look nice and
fluffy and wispy so see how they apply
right I'm going to put those on up
camera and I'll be back in a minute
right so I've got one lush on Australian
it's such a beautiful lush I absolutely
a little bit like it looks so pretty
and then I've gone to put the second
lush on and it's not the right lash like
it's a less lush again what you can see
like on this side the lashes are shorter
and on the side where my wrist is the
lashes are longer which makes it another
left eyelash I don't know what to do at
this point but I just taken it off and
like that is definitely a left eye rush
as well this is the lash that was on my
eye and be honest is kind of fuller all
the way around but you can see like
right at the inner corner on this
I like it a lot shorter which surely
makes it yeah I understand that as a
left eyelash the world is honestly
testing today mm right sorry I'm just
gonna put them on so I'm going to put
this one which is also in my opinion a
left eyelash I'm just going to play on
my right eye because that's what I'm
going to do beside a short deal good
deal then put some mascara on my lower
lashes I love that for bottom lash
mascara that is been washed by Marc best
bottom lash mascara I've ever used it's
so good he doesn't even look that bad it
looks a little bit crazy on the inner
corner but I'm just going to go with it
they're really easy to apply as well
like literally just walk them on yeah
the actual lashes themselves are
stunning in I'm just confused
like I think abused this whole video
update on the skin that the foundation
still looks really nice it doesn't look
dry at all feels nice because I've not
set too much and it settled a little bit
in the lines in my forehead but nothing
crazy the concealer is definitely just a
no for me okay I'm just going to go over
with a powder contour so I'm just going
to use the like comedians kit by
anastasiya which just looks like looked
like so I have actually used this before
but not in a really long time so and I'm
going to use I'm going to like mix the
middle shade and like be out of shade
because the middle one's a little bit
cool but in fact you know what I'm just
going to just gonna go with it crap that
was so much oh my god honestly guys like
I don't even know what to make of this
video the skin does actually look really
nice off camera on camera it looks so
intense for like in person it looks
really nice I realized that my high line
just doesn't look blended but it also
looks a bit of a mess because my roots
need doing so don't mind that eyeball
highlight I'm going to use the in a coal
care I've used so many uh Nastasia
products in this video don't mind me
okay I'll start with Forever Young
whoa hello and I started a glow here to
let my favorite thing that she does
because they just never fail me okay so
that was the shade forever young I'm not
even going to build on top with anything
else because it's so intense on its own
and then for blush I'm going to try the
benefit California blush which I got a
while ago and I just not tried yeah it
looks like so it's a really beautiful
sort of peachy coral and it's got like a
gold shimmer in the middle so oh that
person that we look like with the eyes
so nicely I really like that that's cute
again it looks really intense on camera
oh my god honestly can we not do this
please and then to finish off I'm going
to try the ourselves via Beverly Hills
and lip palette because I've been dying
to give this a go I don't know what to
expect I'm excited to try it so so I'm
going to use the shade three and four
which of these ones here just because
they're nice and warm I feel like we've
got warm eyes warm cheeks with like the
blush situation and then I'm going to
use a little bit as primary one just to
lighten a little bit I would mix it on
the palate but I don't know where it's
gone so instead I'm just going to apply
it straight to the lips and then I'm
going to blend it with the brush huh
okay that's three I got this fall all
right and there's why I like it
oh I really like it okay
it's going to apply like a little bit
more I guess that's the only thing with
this like because I've not put it on the
pallet and I've not made like a lot of
one color I'm kind of having to like
just really mix it okay so this is the
color it kind of like a reddish British
call out like a brick red I would say I
really love it the colors blended really
well into each other really easy to
apply a lip brush was really easy to
work with because obviously like I
usually use a lip liner and I felt like
I could easily get like my edges and
stuff with the brush the feel of it is
really nice like it doesn't feel dry at
all it's kind of like a satin finish I
would say there's a tiny bit of shine
clip but nothing crazy and yeah it just
feels really nice on the skin very thick
or on the lips sorry yeah I really like
the color of it I feel like I'm gonna
have so much fun playing around with
that and I promise everything really
well to be honest like now the whole
makeup is done I'm not even mad at this
makeup like it looks good I mean oh
anything in the comments down below and
let me know if this has inspired you to
try any products yourself because I
would look to know and if I had to like
recommend anything
I like the foundation definitely not a
foundation if you are dry I would say
like if you are like super dry skinned I
wouldn't I say the makeup for everyone
over this one if you are a little bit
oily and you've been on the hunt for a
good stick foundation then I'd say this
is definitely a good one and it doesn't
look dry not anything on my skin but I
guess the feeling of it like the actual
formula of the stick just just feel a
lot more dry it's not what I was used to
and the contour kit was nice but I'm not
convinced I'm going to give it a couple
more goes before I give like a final
village on it because they didn't blend
as well as like my makeup primer sticks
highlighter he's always going to be
absolutely undersized a little bit for
the best things other brow pencils the
burner finer and the gel I really like
not a massive fan of the gel but
definitely did a signer they're like I'm
just rattling stuff off as a hold of you
to palliate I like that texture shadow
it did not do me justice like did not do
me any favors sorry
and so I'm probably going to get
of the girl when I'm doing like a
dramatic eye look and I've not got
foundation on face because if I didn't
have my makeup on it would have been
absolutely fine but it's because it
ruins my under-eye concealer I don't
like the lashes I love absolutely love a
job working out what the deal is still
without them folks being a left lash I
don't know if that was just me and but I
do really really like them they're a
beautiful style nice and wispy very
lifted perfect for like a winged liner
look in my opinion so when the liner was
crap a Jo like your asshole what else do
we use yeah the lip palette I liked and
that is pretty much it so I really hope
you all found this video interesting or
entertaining or some form of sort the
heads that's good I love you guys so
much and I will speak you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
