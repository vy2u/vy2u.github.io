going to be a get ready with me at slash
first impressions video on this makeup
look right here I wanted to kind of
recreate a look that I did on Instagram
not so long ago that I've never done a
tutorial thought it was just like the
smokey liner that I did for Dells 21st
birthday I really loved the way it came
out so I thought I would recreate it for
you today obviously not using the same
product so because it is kind of like a
first impressions as well I really hope
you like it let me know what you think
in the comments down below it's
obviously very smoky very glam very
glitz and glam I mean it's a sad note on
so I've got to do what I do okay I'm
currently in New York when you're
watching this as well so if you want to
see what I'm up to
I'll pop my vlog channel I never know
which side it is and what I always used
to know outside these little things come
off and now I just don't know your cue
to see it what I'm getting up to feel
free to follow me on that as well
obviously don't feel like you have to
but I thought I would just let you know
I'm gonna get straight into it and not
ramble so I really hope you like the
look that I came up with and if you want
to see how I achieved it and have a
little chat with me then just keep watch
okay so the first product I went in with
were some nails and I usually wear
acrylics but I'm trying to get out the
hobbit of having acrylics on just
because they're a little bit damaging a
few nails and stuff so I thought I'd try
some press-ons instead so these are the
impressed press-on manicure sets and
they very kindly sent over a bunch of
different styles and varieties and stuff
like that they've got some really cool
designs I picked out as you can see the
kind of dark maroon color and then
there's also like a feature nail which
is kind of like the zigzag with silver
glitter just because it's not at
wintertime I thought these would be cute
just like watch my hair so in each set
you get 30 nails obviously there's a
bunch of different sizes and stuff
because everyone's nails are going to be
different sizes and you also get six
accents which I kind of like the what I
have on my fourth finger like my ring
finger and you also got a prep pad which
you use before you apply them which
basically helps to cleanse the nails and
make sure that they can stick really
well and you also get a mini file as
well which is super cute so the whole
idea with this product is it's super
easy to use it basically helps you to
achieve a one-step gel manicure look
which you can just like do in minutes I
was actually really surprised at how
quick these talked considering I don't
usually use it stick on nails and I
thought they'd be a bit fiddly
they were so easy to apply is no glue or
anything like that so there's nothing
messy or super like fiddly
and basically have a super whole jewel
layer adhesive which is what six into
the nails and what makes them stick so
well so they're ready to use straight
out the pocket you just have to clean
your nails with the kind of cleaning pad
and then you just peel off the film and
stick them right onto the nail and
they're really easy to remove as well of
course because they aren't like stick on
nails so my nails were already filed
down so I let you just took them all out
of the packet and then just started
sizing up against my natural nails
because obviously you want them to look
as natural as possible and all you have
to do is just take out the little
cleaning pad I did also use the cuticle
pusher they had this little kind of
water and a cuticle pusher in the pack
as well and I just use that to push back
my cuticles a little bit because that
definitely helps with kind of lay in the
male's well if you know I mean and then
once I've cleaned each nail I basically
just went ahead and peeled the back it's
kind of like a film on the back of each
nail you just peel it off and you
basically just want to kind of angle it
down towards the cuticle of your nail
which is the back of your nail you just
want to angle it down so it kind of
slots in and fits your nail nicely if
you know what I mean and then you just
press it down and you hold it down in
the middle affairs and then just hold it
down each side just to make sure it's
well stuck they do stick really easily
so I didn't find that I have to use like
that much pressure or anything like that
I actually really like them I really
like the color I like the way they fit
on my nails they look like they
literally look like my natural nails
which is obviously what you want yeah
thank you so that was the first step of
this little get ready with me so the
first thing I want to do is browse oh my
gosh this is so dirty
yeah exposed stray so this is my iconic
London this is the sculpture and boost
eyebrow cushion which I've seen so many
things like I've seen so many people
talk about this okay so this is what it
looks like inside you might have seen it
on yeah there you go in a couple of
videos and stuff so it comes with a
little like - jewel and hid brush which
I mean I like it and I like the fact
that it folds out and has a long handle
and stuff but I probably still just use
my own and then the actual product is
inside so I'm using the shade what shade
amazing medium so I'm gonna go into the
darker side first I think which is this
side you can just about see the
difference if anyone else watching this
use this because like if you have what
you thought you like it's making my
brows look a bit like I'm not the word
is just like overly harsh I don't know
if it's just cuz I'm using the darker
color no no about
okay so browser on I don't know how to
feel about that I do like it now that
it's on um it wasn't like the easiest
thing to work with I feel like you have
to build it up a little bit just to make
sure that it's like even in all the
right places cuz I feel like sometimes
if I didn't do like a thick enough part
in one area it looked a lot lighter than
other areas in my brows I think made my
brows look a bit uneven and at first I
just went over and stuff and I do
actually really like it now and one
thing that I do really like about it is
the fact that it's quite easy to clean
up like because it's a liquid you can
kind of just go around and clean it up
really easily with a brush if you mess
up the brow shape so I don't know I'm on
the fence it's probably not something
I'll reach for toilets what I do
actually really like it now that it's on
great to prime the eyes we've got a
really exciting product oh my gosh it's
been so long I've wanted to try this for
like what feels like forever oh so this
is the it's heart-shaped and oh I got
two shades I got the shade light/medium
honey which is this shade and I got the
shade light sand which is a bit lighter
so mmm
what do i prime with I don't know I
don't know I think I'm gonna use lights
oh no it looks quite light though I'm
gonna use light medium honey although
this looks like it has a pink undertone
and I'm probably not gonna like that
it's hard to match shades online like
okay we're just gonna say it
mmm I like that I like that a lot boys
and girls and then following on from the
shape tape we're also gonna be testing
out the tart tartlet toasted poly and
I've had one of the tablet palettes
before I've got the in and bloom palette
and I absolutely love it so I'm just
going in with a 2 to 4 by mark and I'm
going to get this shade cashmere which
is this cheeky monkey right here and
then I'm just gonna mix in a warmth
which is that one there and just use
like the darker just like all the maps
and stuff they're always quite powdered
or eat our eyes shadows what someone
explained my speaker always just that I
just starts playing music randomly so
we'd like why does it do that
not really like being too neat with the
either because I'm gonna clean up cuz
we're doing quite like a graphic wing no
one else got ghosts in the house not
that I actually think I do have a ghost
but I don't know does anyone else have
like weird things that happen to them in
the house I'm gonna go in with the shade
latte which is down here and then I'm
gonna just press in it at the minute
pressing it into the crease and then I
don't got a tree over yeah I was saying
to mom yesterday that we really need to
get the tree up but because we're having
the kitchen door and the house is just
not in any state for a Christmas tree
but as soon as it's done I'm telling you
a Christmas tree is going on okay you
just want to take a makeup why I'm just
gonna stop I mean there's not really a
lot to clean up as such okay so you want
to take a black eyeshadow I'm using the
makeup forever I don't know what this is
and m100
just using a flat definer this is a
sigma e 15 I'm just gonna start smudging
that here so we're kind of doing like a
smoky wing so you don't have to worry
about it being like really neat because
in that photo the wings like a really
kind of blow now and like smudge and
then I'm gonna use my Maybelline eye
studio lasting it drama gel liner I've
not gotten a new gel liner so I'm just
gonna have to use this one I'm just
gonna pop some towards like the outer
and like the very lower lash line I go
in and start smudging it a little bit
you just want to be quite like soft with
this because you obviously don't want to
get it like all over the crease I am
actually gonna dip back into that's Hart
palette and just use the shade cozy mix
with a tiny bit of fire size just
because I feel like when I did this the
outer corner was a lot darker just gonna
like tuck that in yeah just going back
in with the pull up just running that
along the lash line and then you want to
make sure that like this is straight
line from the wing to the lash line I
can't speak when I do eyes
I'm just gonna soften it because I kind
of just want it to all blend into one if
you know I mean they said that is how
it's a look-in I don't know if you can
see but like the line is just as much
like it's not a sharp line Oh like I'd
usually do but I feel like it just looks
a little bit more edgy and like grungy
okay so for lashes I'm going to do
something a little bit different and try
out some individuals I've actually been
wearing and approach a lot I'm wearing
individual lashes a lot recently but
I've just never put them on on camera
before so these are the kiss hot Couture
natural premium lashes and they've got
like different lengths which is really
important for me because I feel like
that's the only way to make look to make
individual lashes look natural is when
they're different lengths so I basically
just got a tiny blob of glue unlike the
outer packaging and then all I'm gonna
do is with tweezers these are quite long
actually hmm so I'm gonna start with
I'll start with the medium which is like
the middle row and I literally just take
tweezers and just like pick one off like
that and you just want to dunk it in the
glue it's tiny bear and then just pop it
on your eyes
great so that is what they're looking
like I might adjust them a little bit
and but I basically just mix the long
medium and short so as you can see I've
just used a mix this shot here and then
there's mediums and long so I just use
these at the very outer corner and then
I just use the short or once as I got
n-well primer and foundation I'm gonna
use the products that I used in my
beautybay video so this is the
illamasqua Hydra rail primer and then
also the la girl pro coverage just
because I know it's not technically a
first impression because I've already
use them but I kind of just want to
check that I love them if you know I
mean and because when I did that make up
I literally filmed it like 10 o'clock at
night and then I took it off straight
away oh yeah that's what I'm going to
use because I wasn't really impressed
with them but I want to know like they
last as well if you know I mean in that
they look good by the end of the day
gosh I never usually have poops in like
before I do makeup and they're just like
Salam and all over the place I'm gonna
mix in this honey bit of my w7 genius
feather-light foundation just because
the shade in the pro coverage from LA
girl is a bit dark
it's just lighten it a tiny bit I'm
still gonna have to blend it down my
neck couple I mean what's name know just
kind of over like how long this
foundation goes for like it just applies
and applies it applies it's like it just
never bloody runs out that one pum I'm
just gonna go and dump in my booty
blender back had it again oh my gosh I
nearly just miss the stool okay then
obviously for concealer I'm gonna use
its heart-shaped tape so I think I'm
just gonna mix these two shades that I
have cuz I'm worried this one's a bit
pinky and I don't really like you guys
know I don't really like yeah a lot of
pink under my eyes it's not as like it's
quite thick which I knew it was going to
be but it's kind of like it just dries
down a bit quicker than other concealers
that I have so just gonna get it set
down because obviously with it being
thicker that's probably why it's creased
so quick so I'm just using
oh so I'm sure she's in the cover of X
illuminating certain powder that was a
bad move okay
well sure it was not a good idea oh no
oh my god she's not gonna be able to see
but it's completely ruined that we're
gonna have to like remove that with
makeup wives but we were doing so well I
hate doing this with concealer if it
dries down it never blends like the same
afterwards that's a bit better that's as
good as it's gonna get let's be honest
oh yeah miles better doesn't look too
bad they look pretty much the same I
think it's just cuz I know us different
right well I'm gonna use that cover
effects to set the rest of the skin
because I did really like that in the
beautybay video as well I was gonna use
a cream contour everything's going wrong
right well I was gonna use the soap &amp;amp;
Glory girls contour Wow and this is like
a cream palette so it's got like a cream
Bruns at a cream highlighter at a cream
blush I was gonna use the cream bronzer
but I've just set my face with powder so
okay I'm gonna test out the Giorgio
Armani sonnet from the sonnet fabric
share bronzer in the shade 100 which
looks like so oh yeah that is nice that
is a nice bronzer Oh nobody uses like
myself before I have my makeup done with
that but I've never used it myself oh
yeah that is nice that blends so well
isn't it as a tip brush to contour my
nose which some people might cry I might
kind of upset some people but I kind of
just do it just to bronze my nose a
little bit I don't console that much
really
so this is the Kiko 2:08 water shadow
after my P o box haul so many of you let
me know in the comments what number this
was and the guys at wizards as well very
kindly sent it over so thank you so much
I can't wait to try air it's gonna use a
sigma and tapered highlighter which is
an f-35 and the bronzer brush that I
used is a Mac 135 I got so many
questions again about my bronzer brush
with some reason I really like the color
of
it's like a really nice shade of gold
okay so I'm gonna finish lower lashline
we're gonna dip back into the tartlet
toasted palette and just use the shade
warmth I believe yeah
warmth and cozy which I like the warm
rat kind of almost want to leave it like
that but I do want to go with what I did
in the picture so I'm just gonna take
the Jojo Armani what is this the
waterproof smooth silk eye pencil in the
shade one I've been obsessed with this
it is such a good pencil I get so opaque
and then we're just gonna take the flat
definer and the black again the black
shadow and I'm just going to blend the
black and the kind of breads together
and then I'm gonna take the shadow and
I'm just gonna like stump to create a
bit of a cat eye on the inner part and
then just wrap it round into back into
the upper part of the eye okay eyes are
John I just put some lower lash mascara
on as well all we've got left to do is
the lips so for lips I'm gonna test out
one-upping nude sticks because I
mentioned this in my PR haul and this
was in a little sat and they're all by
different influences I believe so I
can't actually read the name on this but
I'll leave a link to it down below oh
this is in the shade Montaigne I don't
know it's kind of like a pinky nude so
I'm just gonna line my lips with this
these are so creamy like it's like
butter
I'm obsessed like that is so comfortable
like it's literally just glided straight
on so I'm not gonna go in without
lipsticks it doesn't need it I'm just
gonna finish off with a gloss I don't
really know if this is gonna match what
we're gonna give it a go anyway this is
the kylie jenner gloss in the shade
glamour so it's not really gonna match
but we'll go with it I like that I'm not
like crazy about it
the specks of glitter a bit inconsistent
so it kind of looks a bit like odd on
the lips but I'm not like commodity I
like the kind of obviously like the
glossy look it gives shouldn't get that
it's a freaking gloss either way this is
the finished look so if you want to know
where like the hoops and stuff it from
I'll link them all down below I really
hope you like the look that came up with
I hope you love the nails let me know
what you think in the comments down
below and yeah I think that's pretty
much it so thank you so much for
