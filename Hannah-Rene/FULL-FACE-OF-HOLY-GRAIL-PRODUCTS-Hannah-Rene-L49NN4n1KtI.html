a full face of Holy Grail products which
I am so excited about because obviously
everything I've used on my face today to
this look but my favorite product of all
time for like whatever category is mr.
God if you ever see a video where I've
got a lock on that looks like there's
just like glowy skin and you lit a warm
crease a wings or maybe not wing and
from Russia's hundred percent of the
time this is what is this is literally
as a draw in my little questionnaire
I've moved home and I was drawn when a
collection that is a Holy Grail draw
where it's like if I want to do a makeup
look and I just want throw something on
and I know it's going to look good these
are the products I use sorry laughter
you look weird by the way I managed to
swallow one of my minis and lose the
other the temporary one by the way and I
watch all the news but yeah sorry my

as well if you want to see how I
achieved it then just keep watching
I know what would you a voice OS just

moms giving me a cold so mom way more
small talk yeah so we always over so I
hope you enjoy it I'm not gonna wear
those for a while
let's hope I can keep it together I love
you and I will teach you real soon
welcome okay so starting out with
moisturizer and using me number seven
and beautiful skin day cream this is the
normal to dry version they do it in a
bunch of different skin types with my
skin it's normal to I which is why I use
this one absolutely adore this
moisturizer I've used like three parts
of it now this one and the body shop my
favorite
ones I just think are so good then onto
primer I haven't used this a lot
recently I'm not going to lie but I felt
like I had to use it for this video
because it definitely is a Holy Grail so
this is the midea men post shave balm
sorry it's basically a pro shave balm
for men who shave their faces and I use
it as a primer because it has glycerin
so makeup it heads really well on top of
it I've used it for so many years now
you guys know I love it and then on to
foundation this was such an easy one at
the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD sick I am
so obsessed I used two shades white
three to five and then I mix in a little
bit of why for four or five as well so
full coverage but for really minimal
product so this is how I use it I
basically take it straight onto the
brush from the stick and it's just so
full coverage but it feels really
weightless on the skin it's like
invisible on the skin even though it
gives you so much coverage it's like
magic it really is like magic I'm not
even joking so I then take the darker
stick and I use this to warm up the skin
so I basically apply it around my
temples my cheekbones around the dryline
themselves it doesn't actually like a
console because it's too warm but it's
just so good at like adding a little bit
of depth depth to the face sorry and
just yes just like warm up and give that
bronzy glow then on to concealer and mix
in Maybelline and NARS sheer glow and
Marcia Cornell's ready and creamy sorry
absolutely adore these concealers
together it's all I've been using
recently the Maybelline one in
particular is definitely a Holy Grail
the NARS one is like made its way into
the family I would say so I will list
the shades that I used down below but
honestly these are insane so I just used
mostly the Maybelline one and then I add
three stripes of being last one and it
just helps to lighten it and add a
little bit more of a highlight then I'm
just going to blend it all out with the
Beauty Blender because that is my
favorite way to blend out concealer just
make sure that it stops it from creasing
and it also picks up excess product so
it's not too heavy under the eyes
because I hate it concealer looks cakey
under the eyes because the skin is so
much thinner it's really important to
make sure we have no excess product so
it's a really good way of doing that and
then I just set it in place as well then
to set the rest of the skin I use the
Rimmel stay matte a doorless powder so
much it's drugstore as well so the price
is right it's so bloody good so good
honestly it really helps to keep
everything in place without modifying
the skin it
you to March then I did brows off-camera
I do have a brow routine which I will
link down below and then on to eyes and
using the modern a hunt palette love
this so much it's definitely my go-to
I usually just mix the four shades that
I'm going to do here so the two warm
Browns the deep red and the normal red
and this is literally a 5-minute look
for me because they blend so so well
that it honestly takes no time you work
on the eyes and it's good to go so I
just start off with the to medium Browns
pop those in the crease and then I move
on to the more red shades as well
honestly cannot go wrong with this
palette I love it for every single type
of looks I do it's easy for daytime it's
good for evening and something super
glam because it's got a darker shade in
that as well it's just incredible and I
know it's a little bit more pricey one
hundred percent one hundred and ten
percent is worth the money like I love
it so so much especially if you like me
and you like warm eyeshadows and then
just pop those under the eye as well on
the lower lash line I'm basically doing
like my go-to look with it so this is
what I do on like an everyday basis I
would say and it's what I've had on for
the previous two videos as well in case
you were wondering cuz I did see a lot
of comments asking then onto winged
liner this is like a new addition to my
Holy Grail family but this gel liner is
so bloody good this is from Sigma it's
the wicked black gel liner and it's just
really good because it's so smooth and
it doesn't dry out like it's like a gel
it's a gel liner but it's more of a
jelly than all the gel liners that I
have like other ones which is so drying
and so hard to work with whereas this
stays like really soft and almost like
wet feeling it's honestly it's
incredible I love it so much so I just
use that to create my wings I'm using a
brush by Sigma as well I recently got
this because they very kindly send it
over and this little brush as well a
current of the name of it but I'll link
it down below again insane and then what
I use to fill my line in at the minute
and I've been linking these on Instagram
a little bit these are the Laura Geller
calligraphy pens so they come in three
different forms you basically get a pack
of three this is the more chunky one and
they're just the best pen liner of work
with because they don't dry out and they
are super super black so again
absolutely love those then it flushes
you all guessed it Lily lashes in day
makeup and recently fades fluttery wispy
everything I could ever want their
capture
as well I just honestly the perfect like
I wish I'd made the slash because I
loved it so much and then to highlight
the inner corner and brow bone I'm using
nylons by Mac which again is just a
favorite of mine I love it so much
best thing to highlight my inner corner
and brow bone with personally it's very
intense so if you don't like anything
it's too much you're probably not going
to like this because it really is quite
blind in and but I just love it it's got
a really beautiful like gold tone to it
as well so it just complements like warm
looks so well then answer brands I'm
using the makeup forever programs fusion
adore this one's let's still March one
hundreds in my favorite I love it more
than any other brands that I have this
and Mac marelize skinfinish are quite
close but this one really does just take
the Hat or take the prize I thought you
know about seniors oh my god and
honestly it really does blend it like a
dream as you all know beautiful shade
beautiful consistency beautiful formula
and yes absolutely love it and then it
for highlight I'm using the makeup
forever Pro like fusion as well this is
in the shade to look at it honestly I
don't even need to say anything because
it's just that on the screen for
everyone to see is so pretty it's just
oh and it melts into the skin it's not
chunky it's got no glitter in it nothing
like that it just looks insane and then
this bad boy is something that I've
added in recently this is one of the
starlet powders look at it in the shade
13 again by Makeup Forever if you listed
down below this is insane like I use the
tiniest bit because it's so friggin
blinded I just pop that on the very high
point of the cheekbone and honestly it
completes it so well like if you like an
intense highlight you will love that so
again I will pop it down below is the
solid powder in it 13 then for lipliner
I would use strip down but I have lost
strip down guys I'm about sort of new
one it's a tragic moment honestly I
swear I don't know it's gone but instead
I'm using a Rimmel lip line little a
remote lip liner this is in the shade
spice and I love it just as much almost
I would say definitely a good Joker
alternative remove the really good lip
liners and then for liquid lipstick or
lipstick in general I was either going
to use this which is the Anastasia
Beverly Hills
maked liquid lipstick or the two-faced
and melted Martin child star I love both
equally child stars more pink and this
is more orange and I for this look I
wanted something more orange to match
the eyes so
the way I love those by ended up going
with this one I love a good liquid
lipstick I hardly ever wear normal
lipstick anymore because I just love the
feel of a liquid one it was so much
longer and then four let's go what is
this lip gloss oh my goodness gracious
me and then for lip gloss I'm using it
the NYX butter gloss in the shade
fortune cookie a beautiful beautiful
nude and it really does make your lips
look so wet and juicy and yummy adore
this again at drugstore products
the price is floating right boys and
girls I don't know why I keep saying
body in this video honestly someone help
me and then you finish everything off do
a skinny dip lips upper insane I only
put it on the center part of my lips as
you can see and it really does just
catch the light and such how to use
different way like oh I love it I love
it so so much how many times can said
about all these products in this video
class and then it for the seconds right
we're going to use Urban Decay gel
favorite setting spray of all time it
keeps makeup in place keeps it chewy
keeps it looking lovely and luscious
that is everything so I really hope you
all enjoyed this video sorry it is
voiceover was a mess because like I said
I'm not to run in so long let me know
what you think of the look let me know
if you tried any of these products
yourself I'm gonna go because my throat
is really really sore
I love you so much I love you Selena
Bart and I will speak to you in next
week's video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
