you if you want to eat this look then
just keep watching so boys and girls the
first thing that we're going to do today
is prep Rachel's skin and we're actually
starting with mine
one cult favorite product of the air
because this is definitely a product
that I found and loved throughout
two-seven 2017 so you guys will know I
love this already I speak about it so so
much this is the sunday riley CEO
moisturizer it's basically like a really
hydrating moisturizer for normal to dry
skin I would say I'm just obsessed it's
one of those products that's really made
a difference in my base in skin care
routine and stuff so this is definitely
my number one fave from coal beauty at
the minute I am obsessed with it so we
use that for Rachel's base and then
going on to another cult fave this is
the Becca ultimate coverage complexion
cream which again I've kind of raved
about throughout the year because as you
can see it is super full coverage this
is in the shade tan which Mac matched
Rachael's tan perfectly as you can see
it's just a really good full coverage
foundation it gives a really nice finish
it kind of looks jewy on the skin here
but it is more of like a matte finish so
it's really good for nights our
photographs really well as well it's
perfect for just like yeah night style
when you're gonna be taking pictures and
things like that
I sometimes mix it with a mom or
Streisand foundation if you're normal to
dry I'd probably recommend that cuz it
is like I said more on the Mac side but
all in all if you want a good full
coverage foundation this is 100% the one
so onto concealer and like sponges and
stuff the beauty blender has honestly
taken over my life this year this is
kind of like the before and after when
it's dry and then Wow as you can see it
practically pretty much doubles in size
once you've run it under the water and
stuff and it just blends out foundations
and cream products and concealers so
blooming well like I am obsessed with
this I never thought I would like find
something that replace the Sigma brush
that I used to love but as soon as I
started using this for concealer and
then for setting onto the eyes with
powder like it's just a dream like it
makes everything look so flawless it
makes everything melt into the skin I
don't know what we were speaking about
here but yeah I'm just obsessed with the
Beauty Blender you guys know I use if
you can see like 24/7 again and then on
to some brows we're gonna use a Nastasia
beverly hills dipbrow again this is all
I use at the mini I kind of switched
between like brow pencils and pomades
but I feel like permits are just so good
at giving like a more structured brow
this one is in the shade dark brown
which is obviously my shade but it's
really cool because actually it fits
Rachel's hair and like brows perfectly
now that she's dyed I had a little bit
darker but kind of like the same root
color which is super cool
but yeah I'm just using it to define the
tail I could have elongated a little bit
more but you know it is what it is and
then the great thing about pomade as
well obviously you got the really good
kind of structure that looks was the end
of the brow but and when you come to the
front you can kind of flip the brush on
its side and use it to create like more
hair like strokes if you know I mean and
kind of fade out so it looks a little
bit more natural if you want to use the
word natural and then to finish off the
skin we're going to use another
Anastasio product so this is the contour
care I'm pretty sure this one's in the
shade fire or it might be light I can't
quite remember but of course it will be
linked down below with everything else
and I'm just kind of mixing it the three
shades on the bottom row just as like a
bit of a custom color just to warm up
Rachel's skin a little bit and just kind
of contour and add a little bit more
structure and definition again me and
rage love a good bit of bronzer so you
know just slap this right on and then
onto highlighter again I just honestly
Anastasi at nails it with so many
products so this is the sugar glue okay
I think I'm not entirely sure again it
will be linked down below and then onto
another one of my top sanic cult
failures we're gonna be using a sigma
tapered highlighting brush I get so many
questions on this brush and when I use
in videos it's literally all I ever used
I'm pretty sure it's an f-35 but again
it will be in the description bar and
this is like I said all I use for
highlighter because it packs it on so
well because it's a little bit more of
like a dense fluffy brush it just
supplies the product really really
pigmented but still blends out really
nicely which I love and then for blush
again absolute cult fave I had to pick
this one out this is pretty much all
I've used for blush throughout the year
this is benefit California I have to say
it this year I've kind of like toned it
down with with blush like I don't tend
to wear it as much as I did last year
but if I do this is pretty much all I
reach books it's just a really gorgeous
kind of like peachy color complements
every single look really well like
anything neutral or anything with color
like it always looks so so pretty so I
just pop that on the apples of the
cheeks and then we're gonna use a
Nastasia prism palette which I did
actually use in a testing video and you
will have seen in the video I loved it
and so I'm starting off it with the
shade Eden I think is I'm not entirely
sure and but kind of like the neutral
peachy color and I'm just popping that
in the crease I've done at one eye off
camera as you can see these shadows
blend really well and there's pretty
much no fallout with them
which is amazing so I just used that
kind of like neutral peachy color and
then I'm building it on top with satin I
believe it is which is kind of more of
like the red color and as you can see
I'm doing like kind of windshield wiper
motions and blending it right the way
into the crease but then also dragging
out to create the kind of wing Chi and
then we're gonna use a more tapered
brush and the shade parallel to
emphasize the outer corner and the inner
corner because I wasn't gonna go for a
halo eye but all of a sudden it just
started happening so I did parallel on
the outer and the inner kind of just to
emphasize and like define those areas
and then I'm gonna use this shade
eternal maybe I'm gonna use like the
bronze II shade on the very center of
the lid and that's what's gonna make the
halo eye pop I'm just obsessed with this
color combination I feel like it's so
lovely for like autumn winter time it
just looks fab on Rachel's blue eyes as
well and then you just want to go ahead
and blend the matte shades on the lower
lashline so I'm using Eden satin and
parallel as I did in the crease and just
doing kind of like a similar thing to
balance the eye out so I blended them
all on the lower lashline and catch
parallel on the outer corner as you can
see you then want to pop mascara and
lashes on if you want to if you want to
do just mascara and that's absolutely
fine but Rachel did pop some lashes on
it as well and then it finally all we
have left to do is lip so the product
that I picked out for lips I picked
three out because honestly I just love a
good kind of juicy glossy nude and
there's a couple of products I use to
achieve that so at the minute I am
loving nude sticks like ever since
called Beauty something is over I'm just
obsessed so this it's kind of like a
little gift set which would make a
really nice Christmas present which
includes a bunch of different kind of
nude nude sticks that were kind of in
collaboration with bloggers and stuff
which is really cool so I'm just using
at the shade
go-girl and I popped that to outline the
lips and then also to fill the lips in
and then for the initial glass we're
gonna go in with NYX butter gloss in the
shade fortune cookie which again I've
mentioned so many times this is like my
favorite drugstore gloss of all time
smells amazing and it gives the lips
such like a high shine finish I
absolutely love it it just makes your
lips feel really juicy and yummy which
we all won of course and then I wanted
to use it one last product just to
finish off so the very last product of
my cult top-10 is at the jus a skinny
dip lip supper because again I feel like
these just absolutely
nailed it I don't know just nailed it
this year I feel like they were just
everyone's favorites I literally only
use this in the center of the lip as a
bit of a highlight because again very
high shine like super super intense so I
only wanted it on the center but yeah
this is pretty much the finished look so
I really hope you guys liked it I am
obsessed I just think it's so juicy and
glam and yummy and of course Rachel
looks absolutely gorgeous as always
so this is the finished look Archer yeah
obsessed we love a bit of like a warm
glow over Taylor eyes as I said in the
intro all of my top 10 occult picks will
be in the description bar below in order
of my faves I know you guys will
probably guess them as well because the
things that I use like all the time um
and I feel like we've shared our face oh

up yes bits you need to pick up so all
in all yeah yeah thank you so much for

million times over and I'll see you in
