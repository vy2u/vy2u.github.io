hope you're all well it's been a long
time since I last uploaded on a Tuesday
but I want to get back into doing it
testing Tuesdays how many times can I
say Tuesday yeah I want to go back into
like testing more brands and more
clothing runs and stuff like that and I
used to love doing these like as a
weekly thing so I'm gonna attempt to do
that again today we are gonna be testing
at keko keko Milano I have not tried a
lot of products from Kiko and when I
asked on Twitter about what brands you
guys want to see a lot of people did
mention Kiko so we're gonna give it a go
see how it goes I literally just run
into Travis and then and just picked a
bunch of stuff up it came to about 175
pounds which it's kind of pricey I mean
it's not super pricey compared to other
runs but foundations in particular we're
like more expensive than I expected or
so airings up the day we've got a
marshmallow vibe on the go these were
actually really weird because I
basically ordered just the marshmallow
part and they were supposed to be proper
earrings but I don't know if you can see
they're just unlike a ring like a circle
thing and that just does not go in the
air so I've kind of just improvised and
put them on hoop I'm gonna start off
with brows so I'm just gonna use the
high pigment wet and dry eye shadow in
the shade is 0-9 because I have to say
brows like the Browse section is just
one thing that I was not like super
blown away by yeah the majority of the
brow products were brow pencils and I am
just not always a pencil girl I prefer
to use something that I can use the
brush so I just picked up an eyeshadow
instead so these just come as single
eyeshadows and like I said this one is
in the shade zero 9 so I'm just gonna
use this on an angled brush to fill in
my brows it looks quite cool on camera
but hopefully it should be OK in a while
since I last use like a powder filling
my brows basically use powder all the
time but you know I just use pomade
instead color is actually quite nice I
feel like it's gonna match my hair
fairly well yours actually say you can
use these wet anyway so I suppose if you
wanted something a little bit more
structured you could actually use it wet
and it kind of is a pomade not really
well made but yeah I'm pretty happy with
that the color matches really well as
well okay so the concealer I picked up
is the skin tone concealer in the shade
zero
five this was they had a couple of
concealers they had this one a
highlighting pan and then a cream
concealer I think and a couple of light
cream concealer palette so Wachtel tons
of shades that's the only thing so I
picked up 0-5 hopefully that should do
the job you should probably be looking
at how much this all is as well so that
eyeshadows are 5 pounds at 90 this is
also 5 pounds 90 oh it's very liquidy
like really thin but the consistency is
super thin and definitely has like a bit
of coverage to it I'd say it's kind of
medium there it's not completely covered
like my legs okay so far eyes I picked
up five more of these single eyeshadows
because they did have like palettes and
stuff but they didn't have that many and
I wasn't like really feeling a lot of
them but I love the fact that they had
some really cool like bright colors
as you can see in the single so I
thought we'd do something fun for a
change because it's not often that I do
color I'm on my channel and soon as they
do quite a bit of like color cosmetics
and stuff I thought it'd be fun to test
it out so picked up a yellow eyeshadow
as you can see which is in the shade at
19:00 we've got a coral at shade which
is in the shade 36 we've got a sort of
like pinky ready shade which is in the
shade 21 I picked up a transition color
which is in the shade 43 it's just kind
of like a warm beige and then a bright
kind of metallic blue for the lid which
is in the shade 27 and then I did pick
up one blending brush I don't like to
pick up tons of brushes just because I
already have so many that it seems like
silly to pick up loads if that makes
sense anyway I'm gonna figure out the
first shade which as I said is in the
shade 43 oh it's nice it's nice and
smooth it's blending well cool that's
really nice spelled him really well this
brush is quite nice as well it's not as
large as like a normal crease brush that
I would use if that make sounds like
it's not as big as a Mac two to four but
in a sense it's kind of nice because you
got like right into the crease okay I'm
gonna take the yellow one next the only
thing that's bothering me a tiny bit
about the packaging is that each one's
in like a plastic container which I feel
like this should be cardboard because
plastic plastic
the best thing for the environment but
that's like the only thing about hockey
I'm just gonna do a similar sort of
blend with this but keep it a little bit
more controlled like my brush movements
kind of like gonna concentrate this on
the inner corner a little bit as well
okay so we're moving on to the next
shade which is 36 so we're getting a bit
brighter I'm gonna take a different
brush for this it's gonna be a muck two
one seven just so we can keep it a
little bit more controlled as to where
we're putting X this is a bit more
tapered I'm just gonna coat the bristles
it's very pigmented and then we're just
gonna like nestle that in there but yeah
I'm literally just keeping this in the
socket so you can just look down you
don't really have to concentrate
just keep wiggling it around the crease
oh gosh I'm obsessed with this color
this is just screaming like
spring/summer gonna go in with the
larger brush which is the Kiko wine just
merge those a little bit I'm just taking
my time blending this up well kind of
building on top of the color just want
to make sure it's nice and vibrant cuz
we are about to go in with a dark color
okay so the next color that we've got is
the pinky ready color just gonna use the
same brush because it's already got the
lighter coral shade so hopefully I'll
kind of help with the blending and stuff
so wanna be even more careful with this
color Wow I feel like we didn't need a
lot of that at all just gonna go back in
with my blending brush with something
like this well with any eye look in
general it's all about just going back
in with like previous colors especially
if you want it to be really like the
color payoff to be really intense okay
I'm pretty happy with that now I feel
like it all looks pretty and seamless so
I'm just gonna take my Mac 2 to 8 brush
which I use to cut my crease and I'm
going to use the concealer again I'm
going to
you a cut crease on the inner corner I
think I was gonna do it in the middle
but I feel like it might look quite nice
from the inner corner so I'm just gonna
put like a bunch of concealer on the
back of my hands and then you just want
to carve out just a little bit above
your natural crease so the shadow that
we've got for the lid is in the shade 27
as you can see is a very bright blue I
did actually pick up another product for
the eyes which is a glitter this is in
the shade zero wine so it's kind of like
an aqua color which I thought might look
quite cute with the blue so I'm just
gonna try and put this where at the
crease has been cut realize what it's
looking like like that glitters helped
it out a little bit and then the last
product that I wanted to try is part of
the new of Valentine's Day collection
this is the key coil
let me lots eyeliner and stamp tattoo so
it's basically like a two-in-one
eyeliner and then an eyeliner stamp so
one end you've got like a heart stand
which I'm not going to use I'm just
going to test out the actual black
eyeliner and try and do a bit of a
winger there oh it's very blacks like
very black strange because it's like it
feels so dry like the product itself
feels really dry but it's really black
and like it glides really easily the
only thing I find with pens is I find it
really difficult to get a sharp point
for a wing well I actually do quite like
that alright I'm gonna go finish the
other eye off-camera and do lashes they
only had one style of lashes in the shop
and I just wasn't super keen on them so
I didn't pick them up I hope you don't
mind I'm just going to use some of my
Lily lashes as usual and I'll be back in
a sec so for primer I picked up the
radiant boost face face this was nine
pounds 90 so just under 10 pounds
everything ends in like 90 P or 70 P and
then I picked up two foundations I
picked up the full coverage two in one
in the shade and 60 because I wanted to
try a full coverage foundation and then
I've also got these skin tone foundation
in the shade and 70 and these were the
full coverage one was 19 pounds which is
pretty expensive for a foundation
my opinion and then the skintone one was
15 well just under 16 pounds 15 pounds
90 yes I didn't expect it to be pink
I don't swatch it in the shop I just
picked it up because anything Brady and
I usually like smells really nice it's
definitely very moisturizing
would you like to plug quite a lot of
primer on so don't mind me yeah it feels
really nice feels really hydrate in its
give my skin like a nice glow and so
don't know what foundations try so I
just swatch both on my skin they are
gonna be dark by the way cuz I do have a
bit of fake tongue left on my nap but
this is the full coverage term one
concealer foundation okay it does match
quite well I know it's darker than my
skin but it is what it is maybe we'll do
this one side and then the other one the
other side I'm gonna use a Beauty
Blender for this just because it is more
on the thicker side mmm
but it all quite well actually matches
quite well as well that's how it looks
on the skin it's kind of like a satin
finish I would say I'm gonna try the
skin tone foundation on the other side
as long as the shade isn't too different
I got the shade and 70 in this so it's
actually a shade darker a little much or
it a little bit darker oh oh it's quite
it's quite dark wow it's just like full
coverage as well I thought this was
gonna be more of a medium coverage oh my
god okay I guess I can see why they're a
bit more expensive now this one is a bit
darker and you can like tell I hate my
life oh my god I've got completely
different shades on both sides my face
what the hell I did actually want to
wear this makeup out as well means we
found them on the go and see Cain and
Cain is the last person that would
notice if I've got two different shades
of foundation on so so far I do actually
refer this Ickes it's a little bit more
luminous and it feels way more hydrating
on the skin I think it was meant to be
more of a hydrating foundation feels a
lot more hydrating on the skin still has
the same amount of coverage if not more
coverage than this side I feel like this
site actually has more coverage although
I don't know if that's because this the
shade is a shade darker okay next thing
we've got a test out again is concealer
just the same one that we used on the
eyes malachite is so it it like rolls
it's like a paint roller and I applied
quite a bit because it was pretty share
so weird like the applicator rolls
can't get over it's like literally a
paint roller on your face blends out
really easily like just sinks into the
skin straight away so that's how it's
look in feel like we could definitely do
with a bit more it is way more of a
natural concealer then what are you
usually wear it's also looking really
funny on to the eyes actually it's
making my under eye look quite textured
can you see that like here it's making
my skin look really touched it which is
weird I never usually get back all right
this is the sort of concealer that if
you wanted to do like a bit of a no
makeup makeup and just really quickly
put something on this would work cuz it
does just sink in and doesn't feel heavy
and it is definitely like more natural
than what I would usually wow the powder
that I picked up is just a translucent
like loose powder so this is the
invisible touch face fixing powder which
how much was this this was 12 pounds 90
so just under 13 pounds feel like that's
just made my own direct really dark not
strange that powders set the face quite
well but I'm not convinced that under
the eyes because for some reason like I
mean it looks alright now but it made my
under eyes look quite dark at first
which was weird they still look a bit
dark like they've you can still see like
bucks if you know I mean hey I did pick
up another brush this is in the number
10 and it is classed as a blush brush
but I thought like the shape and angle
of it might be quite nice for contour so
I'm gonna try this for bronzer instead
so I picked up the smart blush and
bronzer palette in the shade zero three
oh that is what it looks like we've got
like a contour shade and then a blush
shade here oh well quite like that I
like this brush as well like it's firm
but it's still blending well who I'd
that la feel like that's like a really
nice shade it's not too cool okay I've
got two of the
Valentine's Day collection products I
think these are Valentine's Day
collection or they're just not there
cause let me lots I thought because it
was like a lip theme it might be
Valentine's Day but I could be wrong
correct me if I'm wrong and we've got a
highlighter and a blush these were very
actually kindly sent over by Kiko so
thank you very much the packaging for
these is really cute because it looks
like this like it's just a normal
compact and then you open it up and it's
like a little heart shape so this color
is just screaming to me it looks so cute
it's got like a really nice shimmer to
it where I'm just gonna apply a little
bit to the cheeks well it's got quite a
bit of pigment to it I only like put a
tiny bit on the brush just gonna soften
that up there so that's like a little
bit heavier than I would usually like
the colors gorgeous though and then I've
got the lovely Lots highlighter in the
shade 0-1 shine bright gold one nice
quite yellow Gold's on the other side I
thought I'd try out a different
highlighter just to be extra I feel like
we've got a whole different face on the
other side this is the 208 like what are
these called again long lasting wet and
dry eye shadows this was very kindly
sent again and I've heard so many people
talk about this to use as a highlighter
even though it is an eye shadow whoo
they're actually quite similar this
one's a little bit more of like a like a
yellow gold I feel like and this is a
bit more champagne II I'm just gonna
finish off under-eye so much is just
gonna blend the like coral shade I
actually have like loads of product left
on the brush so I'm basically just gonna
use the brush under my face oh I'm so
lazy and then you just want to put some
mascara on the bottom lashes of course
this isn't a Kiko mascara this is Marc
Jacobs but I did pick one up because I
knew I'd be wearing lashes so it
wouldn't really like matter what mascara
I heard on if that makes sense okay and
then all we've got left to do is lift
got a red lip and a nude lip but soon as
the eyes are so bold I feel like it's
best to go with a nude lip so yeah so
we've got a nude lip liner this is the
everlasting color precision liner
in the shade 4:01 and then on top we've
got a smart fusion lipstick in the shade
four zero one so these I'm guessing are
actually kind of pretty much the same
color and then I picked up a lip gloss
this looks like such a pussy gloss I was
drawn to it straight away this is the 3d
hydro hydro lip gloss in the shade 19 so
I'm just gonna put all of those on it
now just to finish off okay so this is
the finished look I know how to say now
that it's all done I'm absolutely
obsessed like I feel like I just a
little bit I just love it I wasn't
really sure when we first put the blue
on but now that the sort of glitz is in
there and the lashes are on I feel like
lashes just complete everything like it
didn't look right until the lashes were
on until they under what it didn't look
right until the lashes were on and the
under eye would die and I feel like it
looks perfect now like I'm just obsessed
with it and the eyeliner isn't really
something that I will probably use tons
like the pen eyeliner because pen
eyeliners I struggle to work with but
considering it a struggle to work with
them I found it pretty easy to create
this wing and it's very black as well I
didn't have to go and talk with any
black eyeshadow or anything like that so
I feel like that was definitely a hit if
you like black eyeliners the eyeshadow
for the brows as well was fab so you
could kind of get that and use it as a
tuned one because you could use it for
actual eyeshadow as well the foundations
actually look really similar now I have
to say I do prefer this one I feel like
my skin looks smoother and it looks more
hydrated where's the full coverage one
which is actually more expensive I do
like it it's definitely got good
coverage and it's know my skin look
really even but it just looks a little
bit drier and a bit more like dull I
feel like then this side which is a bit
more hydrated it's probably not
something you can notice on camera and
but in real life I definitely prefer
this side the highlighters and the
powder bronzes and blushes though
absolutely love I feel like they all
look so pretty
all in all I'm really happy and I feel
like the final look looks really good
and yeah I really hope you enjoyed this
video I'm so excited to be doing more
testing videos again if you've got any
brands
clothing runs as well that you want me
to test out and please do let me know
because I would love to know of course
but I'm gonna go anyway and get this
video edited so thank you so much for
watching as always I love you to the
moon about a million times Oh
and I'll see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
