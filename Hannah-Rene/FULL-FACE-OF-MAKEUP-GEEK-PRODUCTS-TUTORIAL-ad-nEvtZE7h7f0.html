you have an a lovely weekend so today's
video is a really really exciting video
for me I was just so excited to have the
chance to do this
today's video it's obviously a makeup
tutorial on this look right here but
it's actually in collaboration with a
beauty BAE and a makeup geek two of my
favorite brands ever so yeah a couple of
weeks ago makeup geek and beautybay
basically collaborated and did a
masterclass in Manchester which I just
felt so honored to be a part of because
makeup geek is a brand I've just loved
for years and years and years like they
just hold a really special place in my
heart because it was one of the first
brands that I like really invested in
when I first started doing makeup and
YouTube and things like that and it was
just the whole thing was just like
surreal you know yeah I was looking
enough to be a part of that and Marlena
basically did my makeup before the
master class which I can't believe
Marlena did my makeup yeah huge thank
you to Beauty Bay on a makeup geek for
giving me this opportunity and involve
me in this I just had the best time ever
and I just felt so so lucky to be there
so thank you so much and if you just
thank you to everyone that came as well
actually got to meet quite a few of you
guys as well which was so much fun so we
thought it'd be fun for me to sit down
afterwards and basically film a look
using makeup geek product and I also did
a couple of the techniques and stuff
that Marlena did in the master class as
well and I really hope you will enjoy it
I'm gonna stop rambling now because I
feel like I've just been if you want to
see how i got this makeup look then just
keep watching okay so i'm looking at a
little bit crazy because I've only got
foundation brows and concealer and
powder on so I'm gonna start with the
skin just because I feel like I'm
looking a bit flat you know so the first
product I'm gonna go in with is a
bronzer this is the makeup geek a deep
skin bronzer in the shade of burnished
which looks a little bit dark okay but
we're just gonna use a really light hand
so I'm just gonna go in with a fluffy
brush and just take it really really
slow and really study you know oh my
goodness gracious me I literally put the
tiniest bit on the brush okay so we're
just gonna keep blending because she was
pigmented and I wasn't ready blends out
really well but and then it's a little
bit dark so I'm just gonna go in with
damp sponge it's just the same one that
I used to do my foundation earlier I'm
just gonna press it into the skin just
to soften it out a little bit it is so
hot in this room like I can't even
explain I feel like I'm about to sweat
like all of my make pop I actually can't
get over how big winter this is so I'm
literally tap in and then I'm just gonna
like sweep off the excess on my arm and
then go in I always like move my lips to
the side when I do bronze I don't know
why it's gonna soften it all out I
usually do this with bronzer anyway and
highlighter just to kind of melt it in
with the foundation and stuff I feel
like it just makes everything a lot more
thing considering I applied to wait and
watch that side I feel like it wind it
out so well I haven't actually used
makeup geek bronzers before but I really
like the way that looks
and then for highlighter I'm gonna use
the product that Marlena actually used
on me in the master class because I love
the way my skin looked afterwards so
this is the makeup geek flawlessly ever
after fair lady face palette so this is
basically a face plant that comes with a
contour shade highlight shade and then
two blushes and it does come in a bunch
of different like shades and stuff for
different skin tones so I'm gonna go in
with the highlight shade which is
radiant which is this shade here I'm
just gonna pop up
so yeah in the Masterclass she popped
this on first and then she did actually
go in with a foiled eyeshadow I believe
later on that she also used on my eyes
so I'm gonna do the same because my
highlight was popping okay and then in
terms of blush I'm gonna go in with the
more coral shade because I love a good
Carl lalala I love a good coral blush I
don't know why I really should say that
I provide that over a pink blush anyway
so this is the shade flare and I'm gonna
go in with that now again these are
pretty pigmented so I'm just gonna go in
with a really light hunt and then buff
it in well not both a.m. but just like
soften it with a sponge
okay so skin is done I'm gonna move on
to eyes so in terms of eyeshadows
eyeshadows would like the first product
I ever bought from makeup geek and I was
just obsessed like I love the formula so
much so some of you will have already
seen this cuz I've had this for a while
now it took me quite a while to the hilt
so this is
oh gee make up big pally obviously it's
all warm shades because you guys know I
love good one I shadow do you actually
have a full video on this on like every
single color and what every single shade
is inside so I'll leave it on the screen
here if you want to check it out it's a
bit of an old video so I probably look
like a fetus but it's fine and then
we've also got a new product that I've
not tried before I might try using just
this because this is basically a set
palette that you can buy from makeup
geek so this is the in the nude palette
so I'm gonna probably give this a go
today just because it's not something
I've used before and I feel like it
would be easier for you guys to purchase
like a set palette rather than a bunch
of single eyeshadows if you do want to
pick it up the colors in this I'm
absolutely obsessed with as well so I'm
gonna give this a girl I'm gonna see how
it goes so I'm gonna start off with this
shade here which is 10 lines which I'm
pretty sure you come by as a single as
well because I'm pretty sure I have it
my palette I could be wrong but I think
so I'm gonna use a makeup geek soft dome
brush and just dip that in and it will
literally just gonna start in the crease
of my eye so I'm literally just gonna
buff that and I don't really know what
look I'm gonna do I'm just winging it I
know buddy's just winging it but yeah
that's what we're gonna do but I'm just
applying it quite a bit of this because
it's gonna be like our main transition
color so because they're quite pigmented
like you don't really need to build them
up too much anyway but I'm just making
sure it's like super blended and I'm
taking up quite high just because yeah
it's gonna be our main transition color
what's everyone's favorite part of
makeup
I always think the eyes are like my
favorite part but I also really love
doing skin I'm also what am i I was
still gonna do it I'm also gonna take a
makeup geek defined crease brush and
just the exact same color I'm just gonna
stop sweeping that on the lower lash
line I used to do like all of the upper
part of my eye first and then do my
little lash line but for some reason
like when I've got foundation on I just
love doing them together
I might have sass with this color I feel
like he's making my eyes pop quite a bit
as well because it's quite like a warm
brown so I'm gonna go in next with the
shade cabin fever which is just directly
below 10 lines
I think it's cabin fever I'm liking
these right yeah I think I am cabin
fever I know for a fact you can get as a
single because it's literally one of my
go-to Xand like one of my favorites in
my
like all the pallet so I'm just gonna go
in with like a tapered blending brush
and again these are like so pigmented
you really don't need a lot I'm just
gonna start applying that on the outer
corner I made sure I tapped off the
excess as well because because we've
done skin first like we want to avoid
fallout so I'm just gonna build that up
on the outer corner and I'm also just
gonna create like a really small v-shape
I tend to do this a lot with the brush
now like how you see use tape but I felt
like tape gave too much of a harsh line
if that makes sense like I kind of want
it to look sharp on the outer corner but
I still want to look soft so I just kind
of really lightly
I use like a taper brush and I use the
very tip of the brush and I just kind of
mark out the actual v-shape like so and
then I let you just go back in with a
blending brush and I just kind of soften
all of the edges and you can also blend
like the wing bit as well and that again
just softens it out and makes it a bit
sharper and then I also just take it up
a little bit into the crease as well
like just above my crease cuz it just
helps to make your eyes look a little
bit bigger I'm obsessed with these
colors like I feel like they look so
flattering with blue green eyes and then
I also take it a little bit further down
so I want it to kind of link up with my
lower lash line so it kind of just wraps
around the whole eye looks really smoky
I'm also gonna go in it with a little
bit more of tan lines just on this side
cuz I feel like we're missing that color
bit that's another thing when you start
going in with darker shadows sometimes
they can like overtake a little bit and
cover up the lighter ones that you use
or like your transition colors so it's
nice to just go back in with a little
bit more of a transition shade just to
kind of make sure that that comes
through - I don't know what shade to use
on the lid so there's two kind of foiled
shadows in here we've got grandstand
which is at the bottom and then in the
spotlight which is this one here and
again I'm pretty sure these two are
singles maybe grandstand
I feel like that'll look nice with those
colors so I'm first off gonna use my
finger just to apply air just because
that's my favorite way to apply the
shadows they can be a bit chunky so I
feel like your finger just puts them on
quite well and I'm just gonna apply that
so that you do a tiny bit of fallout
with them but it's nothing that can't be
like swept away oh my gosh I'm obsessed
with that okay and then I'm just gonna
go in with the brush that we used on a
little lash line and just soften it all
together I am obsessed with that okay
and then I'm gonna go in weird in the
spotlight which is oh that one there and
I'm actually gonna use this on the inner
corner it's like a bit of a highlight
just gonna pop that and then I'm also
going to use that shade on at the tops
of my cheeks that in the spotlight shade
because Molly you know is saying it's
one of her favorite shades to use as a
highlighter as well so I'm just gonna
take it on a makeup geek rounded blush
brush I'm just gonna just that on oh my
goodness gracious me it's such an
interest in shape because in the pan it
looks really quite pink and it's like it
does apply pink but it's kind of like a
pink reflect if you know what I mean so
it doesn't look too dark on the skin or
anything like that for it to be a
highlight shade very so I think that's
pretty much everything I'm just gonna go
ahead and do it lashes off-camera and
I'll be back in a second okay so eyes
are done I'm absolutely obsessed with
them and that palette
I'm loving so it's got so many of my
favorite shades in already on to lips
we've got something a little bit darker
than what I would usually wear so this
is one of the makeup geek matte plush
lip products and it's in the shade
marriage material which I love the name
I think it's so cute these are like so
dinky as well I'm obsessed it would be
like perfect for trouble so I'm just
gonna apply this all over my lips I'm
not gonna use a lip liner so pray for me
because you guys know I usually use a
lip liner but this is pretty much the
finished step so I'm just gonna whack
this on now so the lip color is on this
is the finished look that was actually
really easy to apply considering I
usually use a lip liner and I don't
usually go straight and with like a
liquid lip that was like super easy the
applicator made it really easy and it
was also so smooth to apply but yeah
this is the finished look let me know
what you think in the comments down
below a huge thank you to BC way I'm
makeup geek for giving me the
opportunity to do
although honestly I had the most amazing
time with the master class and I've had
so much fun at filming this video
because I love makeup pete products so
much they just have such a special place
in my heart but yeah thank you it's so
much for watching I love you guys too
