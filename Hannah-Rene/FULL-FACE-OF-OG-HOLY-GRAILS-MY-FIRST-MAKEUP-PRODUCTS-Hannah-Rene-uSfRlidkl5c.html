hope you all well today it's a really
exciting video and like a video that I'm
just gonna feel super nostalgic the
whole way through the days video is
going to be a full face of my oh gee
Holy Grail so all the stuff that I loved
when I first like very first started
doing makeup which was years and years
ago now it feels like you've been
watching my channel for a really long
time please do let me know in the
comments whilst you watching this if you
remember any of these products that I
used to use because a lot of them I did
use in videos and a lot of them were in
like my very first video and stuff like
that which is no longer on my channel
because it was just a hot mess but I'm
so excited to film this I actually had
to go out and buy a lot of the stuff
because a lot of the things and products
that I don't really use anymore but I'm
kind of interested it's like revisit
them all and see how they look on my
skin and my eyes and lips and stuff now
if that makes sense yeah and I will just
say a lot of it is Mac and that's like
not intentional as such but when I first
started doing makeup like I just loved
mark like I wanted to be a Mac girl I
wanted to use Mac product so that is why
there's a lot of kind of like Mac makeup
and stuff like that in here also
earrings of the day are pretty boring
pretty standard these are just from
pretty little things we're gonna I was
also just re-enter the comments on my
last video which was testing Kiko and
it's like there's a couple of people who
said the earrings that I was wearing
that was supposed to be marshmallows
remind them of tampons and I was like oh
my god well then so the moisturizer that
I picked up is the number seven
essential moisture day cream I used to
use this 24/7 it was literally the first
moisturizer I ever really fell in love
with and it sanitize my hands honestly
it's so important to like wash your
hands or just Pothunters on the sides
around when your butts touch your face
like it's so important ya know they do
this Oh in fact I don't think this is
the right one but well I'll probably do
the same thing it's fun yeah they do
this in a bunch of different formulas I
guess for different skin types really a
photo or moisturizer if you don't want
to spend tons of money on one but you
still want a really good wine one
product that I did want to pick up for
this video which I can't because it's
actually I don't think it's been
discontinued but it's just really hard
to get is the Nivea shade and not the
Nivea shake because that's what I've
actually bought instead I wanted to buy
the Nivea express hydration primer
because if anyone
has watched like my very first videos I
used to use that all the time like all
the time okay so I'm gonna do brows
first and the very first brow product
which is not even a brow product that I
absolutely loved was the soap &amp;amp; Glory
lid stuff this is the exact same one
that I had and used years ago like I
used to use this in my Instagram post I
used to use it on my channel basically a
quad this is actually discontinued like
its honestly blew my mind how much of
this stuff is no longer available
apartment the max taupe and other bits
and pieces so this is no longer
available they do actually have like a
specific brow powder kind of compacting
and but I used to use this shade up here
all the time for my eyebrows as you can
see this palette is just like a hot mess
it's been through some hard times and
some good times
so hopefully this will be the right
shake so I did actually used to use this
again if anyone remembers when I used to
have my natural hair color which is
quite a lot lighter than what it is now
I don't think it's gonna be dark enough
yeah I did you see use this when I had
kind of like the ones day I have blonde
hair but I just had like kind of mousy
brown hair I mean it's still working but
it's just not very dark after there's
probably the next brow product that I
really like loved was the UH Nastasia
dip brow because I used to use it in the
shade blonde again when I had like a hat
I just loved using anything that you
could use with a brush so I'm gonna dip
into my Anastacio brow upon me because
this is like the second brow product I'd
say that I really got into and this one
is in the right shade so it's in dark
brown but ya know I remember like
because I started on Instagram
I didn't start on YouTube straight away
I remember doing like a step by step
post on Instagram of how I fill in my
brows with that quad from soap &amp;amp; Glory
you like a little photo collage of like
all the steps I did to like fill in my
eyebrows I'm just gonna do kind of like
not an everyday look but just like a
simple glam with like a winged liner for
this look I'm not gonna do anything
super crazy this again absolute
throwback this whole video is just one
big throwback but this is the mac
prolongwear concealer and I've got this
in the shade NC 25 I used to use it in
the shade NW 15 when I was younger
my Mac shades are NZ shades and I can
just already tell they're gonna look
like a hot mess because this time for
some reason looks quite pink on my skin
today but yeah I have not used this in
so long so I'm really excited to give
this a girl I picked it up from
Selfridges today wow the smell of it use
isn't so long yeah I know this is the
only concealer I really use I'm trying
to think like what I used after this
when I got into other products I can't
actually remember the next concealer
that I loved so soft ochre ac soft ochre
all the time actually is an eye primer I
should have picked that up
okay so eyes are prime but I shadow I'm
so lucky that I kept this like I
remember when I was having a clear out
of pallets and stuff and I did actually
debate getting rid of this because I
don't use it anymore and I'm so glad
that I did because it doesn't it's not
actually sold anymore it's discontinued
and when I went for lunch the other day
with some of the girls that kind of like
represents dealer and stuff they don't
even remember this eyeshadow palette
because I feel like it's just so old so
this is the old Stila in the light
palette they don't make this anymore as
far as I know I couldn't find it
anywhere online or in Boots or anything
like that this is what it looks like
inside this I'm pretty sure it is the
first pilot I ever bought and I just
remember it has such a special place in
my heart and that's why I didn't bin it
because I was like I can't get rid of it
cuz it's just like it just reminds me of
like when I first got into makeup and
first fell in love with makeup and
things like that so has early special
place in my heart and the eyeshadows are
still incredible I mean it's a good few
years old now so I'm not sure if it's
actually safe to use on my eyes but I'm
gonna use it anyway because it's only
ever me that's used it and stuff like
that yeah it's kind of a shame that you
can't really buy many of these products
anymore cuz this palette is actually
such a cute little palette but Stila
obviously still do a lot of other
palettes and stuff like that and things
that are similar so this shade is called
bliss it's kind of like a cool toned
kind of like a cool toned Brown
transition shade yeah I feel like steel
Ajit's had a bit of a revamp and brought
out like all new palettes with new
packaging stuff because the passion for
this is just like cardboard I'm just
gonna keep it really simple because I'm
gonna do a wing and I one pretty much
like the whole look to just be the wing
if that makes sense so the only shade
I'm gonna go
and with other than that is kitten
kitten is just a staple at Stila like
everyone needs kissing in their life
whether it's the highlighter eyeshadow
whatever I'm just gonna use this on my
finger actually I don't know if you can
see what this has had quite a lot of
love this one and what was this called
bubbly absolutely love these two might
mix them a bit I mean they're just so
pretty the gel liner I picked out for
this is Maybelline at gel studio this is
pretty much all I can remember really
use it and when I started doing wings
like it took me a while to get into
doing like winged liner and stuffs funny
because I don't actually like using gels
that much anymore like I prefer using a
liquid liner which I used to be the
complete opposite like I could not use
liquid whereas now I feel like I've used
my makeup forever liquid liner that much
that I really struggled to use gels so
this should be interesting
some reason I just find it so hard to
use gel now like it feels like not that
smooth to me anymore cuz liquids are
just so smooth it's coming along slowly
but surely I think it's also just
because I find liquid so much quicker
like it just goes on in its John Rose
with this you just have to keep like
dipping back into the pot and stir okay
and then I'm actually gonna go on top
with a liquid just to make it a little
bit blacker this was again one of the
first liquid liners I ever absolutely
loved and just remember having an
obsession with and this is the Rimmel
exaggerate eyeliner it's probably like
one of the blackest liquid liners I've
ever used my makeup for everyone is
blacker but for the price this one is
really good which is why I'm gonna go on
top because I feel like with gel
sometimes hard to get it like super
black unless you go on top with another
liner or a black eyeshadow see what I
mean like that is already so much
blacker okay and then for lashes I've
got my iconic X these are actually
iconic lights because I don't have any
of the normal ikonics at the minute so
hopefully they'll look just as good cuz
I never actually tried these before
believe it or not and again I conics
like they were just my go-to you last
for ages before that I used to use red
cherry lashes a lot and like odd gala
lashes and stuff like that but these are
the first romantic lashes I ever loved I
feel like I feel like
old self obviously but I don't know it's
all just weird right boys and girls for
primer we've got the Nivea man post
shave balm because as I said I did want
to use my Nivea Express hydration primer
but I can't find it anywhere so I feel
like this kind of came after that I feel
I feel gross putting this on for some
reason I don't know why because I used
to wear this all the time but I feel
like it's so bad for your skin I do now
oh I've got in the old smells though
still smells are saying it's gelatin I
was like boys necks I've already know
we're gonna have to blend this
foundation down there I already know
it's the wrong shade the foundation I've
got a Mac Studio Fix because this was
like my OG favorite foundation this is
like the first foundation that I ever
spent like proper money on before that
it was like dream up new stages but I
didn't want to take it that far back to
be honest mine is in the shade NC 37
which is just gonna be way too yellow
and olive tone for me I already know
don't comment ok I'm already saying it
now I've nobody call it's gonna be the
wrong shade but it's fine actually got
this at CCO so it's only 16 pound 50 and
because that's like a discounted makeup
store and I don't have the pump for it
so we're just gonna make do without the
pump I used to get so many different
shades in this like honestly I used to
go in to mark and they'd match me wrong
like every single time no shade
obviously used to work there so no shade
but they used too much me wrong all the
time like I genuinely got a different
shade much to me every single time I
went in all oh my gosh this is just
taking me back I've not used this
foundation in yes because Studio Fix is
um more for like oily skin hello is
there anything in there at all
did it look half empty what the
okay anyway yeah sure your fix it's like
full coverage like full full coverage
and it's more for oily skin because why
don't be like there's nothing in my
container if someone just like emptied
off in my container and put it back in
the box okay we've got something coming
I mean I probably won't use it again
anyway cuz it's not for my skin type my
skin is like normal to dry so it's just
all too much too much too much we use a
looksie foundation brushes because it is
a bit thicker and yep it's the wrong
shade definitely more of like an NW at
the minutes
if you don't know the difference between
an n CN N and W and NC is more like
yellow olivey and then an n W is a
little bit more pink I don't know how I
used to wear this foundation like I used
to wear this when I was like 16 15 14
even maybe not 14 when I was like 15 16
and I used to love it it's a little bit
of Studio Fix so yeah I used to have
like a mix of shades in this like
sometimes I had an NW I was always in
then W I never got much to an NCAA
because naturally when I'm pale like I
probably am a little bit more pinky and
so it either be like an nw20 was the
first one I ever got and nw20 which was
way too dark because Mac foundations do
oxidize a little bit sometimes and it
just used to oxidize so bad on my skin
gel a good foundation but you just have
to like leave it on your skin for a
little bit to see what color works best
this is not a cute angle I can just
smell it I love the smell some people
don't like it but mmm I'm all for the
smell of Studio Fix looks alright but
it's just not the sort of thing that
would wear well on my skin because I'll
just look dry by the end of the day
we've been back on to concealer again
we're going to use Pro Longwear this
might be like too dark no no it's fine
it's like pretty full coverage Pro
Longwear like medium tall so you
probably don't need as much as that but
we're gonna go with it my whole face
just smells of Mac and I love it and
then for all over face powder I'm going
to use another Mac product this is Mac
mineralize I actually have one for
bronzer and one for powder and I'm going
to use medium all over the skin does the
product that I do still really enjoy and
I don't use the I don't use it as much
like all over powder but I do like it
for bronzer and stuff it just blends
like really well and yeah for bronzer
I'm going to use the same powder but in
medium dark so it's a little bit darker
this is actually the first one I ever
bought and I actually bought it after I
have my prom makeup done because I think
she was called Nicole who did my prom
makeup at Marc and I was like blown away
because that was like the first time I
ever had a proper full face of makeup on
and I was like I need this bronzer just
looks like it's so natural on the skin
for like a powder string around the
temples runs up a little bit they're
like it blends so easily you don't
really have to do March I've got two
highlighters and both of them I kind of
wanted to include the first one is the
first highlighter I ever bought and it's
still the exact same highlighter because
again I just struggled to part with
stuff that is like nostalgic you know I
mean like the first stuff I ever got and
again I'm pretty sure I bought this at
the same time as the bronzer or maybe a
little bit after I can't remember but
again Nicole used this on me when I did
and when she did my prom makeup sorry
and of course it is soft and gentle by
Mac so I'm just gonna go in with my
brush it is more like a pinky tone as
well and they have like other types of
highlighters out now like the extra
dimension skin finishes I think they're
called which I do prefer and they've got
a really nice kind of gold tone in that
and then we've got my little Mary Lou oh
my gosh she remembers when I used to use
this all the time this one is a little
bit more gold hence white kind of
replaced like soft and gentle for me
because it just it felt like it's suing
my skin better yeah like that is just
way more me I mean it's a little bit
right now but it's fine
I mean that is very bright that's
probably too bright it's a bit too
bright though Mary Lou is not for the
faint-hearted
okay this I had to dig out because again
it's something that I'm not used in ages
this is my first ever Mac blush palette
and I did actually depart a couple of
these like some of these are blushes
that I bought in the pot when I didn't
have very much makeup at all and just
wanted like single blushes and then when
my collection kind of grew I popped them
all into a palette so some of these are
actually like just stuck in and depotted
by myself and but this is the one that
we're gonna use today who knows what it
is
it's margin it's just one of my all-time
favorite blushes ever i always forget
about it because it's in this palette
and because I don't get this pal
out a lot also can we just look at how
much of a mess it is like this palette
used to got a lot of love okay
I'm nearly just dropped it and so I'm
gonna use my first ever Mac blush brush
as well this is pretty much all I've
ever used and it's like the first blush
brush I have a guy it's a Mac one two or
the right in strobe jar I feel like it's
a 1 to 6 I know just like a peachy tone
with like a little bit of shimmer in but
it's more of like a natural blush like
it's not a blush that's gonna make your
cheeks look really rosy which is why I
like it I'm gonna finish off the under
eye a little bit much you're just gonna
use the mineralized skinfinish in medium
dark but never used to do my eyes like
my under eyes when I first I do makeup I
just used to leave them blank I don't
know why and then I'm just gonna do some
lower lash mascara this isn't really
like an old fave it's just one that I've
pulled out it's just too faced better
than sex so again these are matte we've
got the boldly bat lip pencil which I
just remember using when I first started
doing makeup it was probably one of the
first lip pencils I ever bought from
Matt I'm gonna be using that and then
the lipstick I'm gonna be using is creme
Cup which again this is like the first
lipstick I ever remember like lovin and
again it was because of Jaclyn hill I'm
pretty sure she used to use this all the
time this is the first one I ever bought
which I do not recommend use it a
lipstick I mean this is like 4 years old
now 3 4 years old don't recommend doing
that but it for the purpose of
the video I'm just gonna put it on is
fine I don't still wear it I like I'd
not kept it to still wear it but I just
kept excite nostalgic and stuff so this
one time I made so I'll just pop it on
oh it just feels wrong it just feels
wrong putting it on I used to love a
good pinky nude it's so funny doing this
video because there's so many things
that I would not like we're now if that
makes sense like newts for example I
used to love pink news whereas now I'm
all about like brown and peach news I
had don't really reach for a pink nude
at all and with the base as well like I
said I used to love it Studio Fix
Foundation whereas now it would not be
anything that I would like reach for if
that makes sense and the concealer like
pretty much all of this stuff apart from
like the Bruns that I would say the
mineralized skinfinish
that's probably the only thing I would
really reach for and obviously like
Anasazi a dipper and things like that
yeah it's crazy like using all of these
products again so just not stuff that I
would use now but only no I'm still
really happy with the look I feel like
it still looks lovely I feel like it
still looks presentable yeah I hope you
will enjoyed this video let me know in
the comments what your LG fav products
are and if you still use them because
obviously I would love to know and let
me know if you remember me use it any of
these products because I feel like some
of you will so did used to use them in
videos and stuff like that so cute so
much for watching I love you guys to the
moon and back a million times over as
always and I'll see you in the next one
which might be tomorrow what might be
Sunday we'll see bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
