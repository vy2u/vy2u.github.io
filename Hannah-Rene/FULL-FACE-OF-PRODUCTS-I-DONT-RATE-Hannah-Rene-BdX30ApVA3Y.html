going to be a bit of a different sort of
tutorial so I will usually do today I am
pretty much doing a full face of
products that I don't rate so I'm
YouTube recently I've been seeing a lot
of videos called a full face and makeup
that I hate and I kind of want to do
something similar or something the same
but I didn't have enough products to
make a full face of products that I
completely hate if that makes sense
because a lot of these products I don't
think are back products but they just
don't work for me so I don't really want
to call it a full face of folks I hate
because I feel like that's really strong
and so this is basically a 450 products
that I don't ring as a defense with a
lot of them it either like the price
because I think there's bad things for
the money or I just don't I think
there's other things that are better in
general so I don't reach for them but
I'm pretty much going to go through
every single product and I'm going to
apply them as I would a normal tutorial
I'm not going to try and make this look
bad like I still want to makeup to look
good so I'm going to try and like work
with them as best as that time and but
yeah the point of this video isn't like
any products or anything like that it's
just sort of tell you guys why I don't
like certain things so I'm going to
start with foundation just because and I
have a massive clean-out of makeup
recently so I actually got rid of a lot
of stuff I don't like thing that I don't
wear so the primers I weren't reaching
for I've already gotten rid of but for
foundation I have this one here by Marc
Jacobs this is that I'm pretty sure
quite remarkable yet it's a remarkable
full coverage concentrate foundation and
it just looks like there I bought it
because I saw so many people and like
raving about it and saying that it's
really good like I will admit extremely
full coverage so if you like something
that feels like thick like literally
pain then you will love it but I just
didn't see the height with it I feel
like people either love it or here and
I'm one of the people who just really
doesn't like it my skin is like normal
to dry and I feel like when I first
apply it it's okay but after a while it
really claims to dry patches
it looks really cakey because it's so
thick like I have never worked with a
thicker foundation and this a lot of the
people that I know who like it and I'm
pretty sure like a lot of them do have
oily skin so it probably works better on
the only skin I want to take well I
don't see how anyone with dry skin would
make this work unless you really go
heavy on like moisturizer and primer I
have two shades what choice do I have
um ivory ivory medium which is like the
second
and then I also have honey light which
is like one - one more time so I'm going
to use like mostly this but maybe like
add one little drop of this that you do
not need a lot of this foundation I
can't express how little you need
because it just goes such a long way so
the applicator is like a little blob and
you just sort of like swipe it on your
skin in fact I might just use a light on
maybe the thing is I've got like a
little bit of fake time left on my arms
but it comes off on my neck and my face
quicker and I kind of like want it to
match my arms if you know what I mean
I'm just going to wing it editor now so
I'm literally going to pot like that
more time and then I'm going to do a
tiny tiny blob of that one that's it not
with anyone so yeah that tiny bit is
already covered like that part my face I
mean my friend Dale try this as well
because like before we went to Paris in
September of last year and she was like
I need to buy a full coverage foundation
is that I think I'm going to get the
Marc Jacobs one but I was like well mine
before you buy it so she put right on
like the day we were flying to Paris and
when she says put on shoes she loved it
because it left self-aware issues that
this is exactly what I want so we got
the Paris and then she looked in the
mirror again like when we got that and
she said the same like it just felt so
cakey like it looked dry I know what it
is like it's great when you first put it
on but after that picture - no I'm sorry
I don't know I feel like it just makes
my skin look a bit dull like I even
applied a primer and fix+ which I never
usually need but I do generally just
think this is built more for oily skin
because it has like quite a matte finish
it just doesn't work for me and then
that's for concealer I chose trouble
choosing a concealer but in the end I
picked out the M Decay Naked skin I do
like this concealer but I don't like it
on it Oh
I feel like so many people love it now
do you like it but I have to mix it with
other concealers I just think it's the
thing I like about is very hydrating
like it feels very and yeah it feels
really hydrating under the eyes it's not
drying at all it's quite liquidy and
it's not like thick or heavy or anything
like that but I just feel like the
coverage isn't as good as other
concealers that I have and it crease it
really badly on me which is why I
usually mix it even if I set it straight
away I just feel like it creases so
badly I mean it doesn't cover as well as
I would want to concealer to cover and
so it's like I'd rather spend like six
pound on the Maybelline fit me which I
absolutely love because I feel that the
coverage is good and it doesn't crease
and it melts into the skin a lot better
where I spend like I don't know how much
this was like 18 pounds and does not
have the same effect
do you like what this concealer though
as well is it does offer like a good
amount of shade so this one is in the
shade by initial because it's going to
be really light on my friend today but I
bought it when I don't have tan on
because it's the fairest concealer I've
ever owned and I did really like that
because I feel like some brands just
don't bring out a concealer that's fair
enough especially we like the Maybelline
fit me like the paler shade I have to
have tan on to wear because otherwise
I'm darker than my foundation so that is
one thing I do really love about this so
yeah this is the shade fair neutral so
it's going to be like a look like gonna
be too light as you can see for what
I've gotten today but I don't have a
darker shade so we're just gonna roll it
like already I just don't like it
I've had two different shades as well
like I had to shade I think it's nice at
night light neutral as well which is
obviously a bit darker so I know that
it's not the shade just being too light
because I have had a darker shade in it
as well and I didn't like that on its
own either I just felt like it just
didn't work I feel like he doesn't fit
nice after all I don't know might be for
me and then it's all powder I have seen
Make Up For Ever HD like the loose
powder they have this in a pressed form
and a loose form you guys know I love
makeup forever so it pains me to include
a product in this video and and again I
don't think this is like necessarily a
bad product but I just have issues with
it I basically come to like a compact
like this and then you will
it up and the patter is inside my issue
with this is it flashes like a flash but
is crazy basically like it's got this
lid here which has got like em for some
2-bit in so I just like take the tiny
bit of my powder brush and then I just
sort of swirl it round to get rid of the
excess and just like pocket or I just
think there's like better powders out
there you know like I'd rather use the
RCM a and not have to worry about using
a light hand with it or like not have to
worry about the issues as flashback or
driving you like the laura mercier again
it's just like it's not necessarily bad
like it's still set stuff in place and
it looks good on the skin but there's
just other stuff it does moth you know
there's other stuff that doesn't flash
back and there's other subsets okay just
looks fat for growers
I have a product here called arch the
child Spy it's open glory again you guys
know I love soap and glory I love that
products and this pencil though I just
don't particularly rate though it
basically has a like the pencil on one
side and then it has a corrector on the
other side or like a highlighting bit
which you can use under the brow bone
and but I just like don't get it I mean
see honest it's too light for my brows
at the minute anyway which again is
probably an issue it's weird because I
used to love this when I was in high
school me and my friend al use to uses
all the time and I feel like if you want
a natural brow see if your brows are
quite full and you want something really
natural then you'll probably love this
because it was just for filling in like
really sparse bit and but I just don't
feel like you can get something super
defined with this I try that different
bar pencil like for example the one guys
benefit that I use the other day where's
it gone it's on my benefit which is like
the goof proof brow pencil I really love
and I feel like it's a lot creamier
that's my issue this is quite dry in
terms of other stuff like I love the
bronzer by so from Lori like I love soul
apologizing that's a great product I
look like the shimmer bricks like the
blushes they do great lip products they
do great like obviously skin care stuff
buffs and like body washes I love the
Sun I think it's sugar crush and it's
like smells like um it's not like
coca-cola to me I don't know why but
there are so many things that I love by
then it's just this like I
particularly raise what bronzer I have
the Chanel fill a tank de Chanel like
the universal sort of cream bronzer they
do that looks like this and I just
realized I have set my face very lightly
with powder I mean it so feels tacky
because I didn't going to put a lot of
the powder on because I don't want it
splash back but hopefully also blend
okay because I don't really like putting
Partizan and then doing cream I just
don't like this because again I found it
to be quite dry I don't know if it's
just mine because again I know so many
people that love it and I just feel it
really dry and difficult to blend on the
skin sometimes you did like maybe 10
times or so the good thing about it is
it's a big product that you got a lot of
product I can't imagine this ever
pointing out and it kind of bothers me a
bit I'm pretty sure this is the only
shade that they're doing this correct me
if I'm wrong but it's like labeled as
the universal fronting makeup base and
for me it's like not particularly
Universal because I mean really fair
skin this would look to war on line I
think and then obviously really deep
again like there's not tons that you
could do with this so I'm just going to
dunk my brush in and just like pray for
that if you use a little bit and you
don't like pop on too much at once and
it can work and it can just give like a
like a light bit of warmth to the skin
if you know I mean but I just think is
like that it's just this is why I've
called this video like 4 bits of
products that I don't rate because I
don't hate any of this but it's like I
don't hate any of these things and don't
thinking about I just don't have stuff
that likes better I guess I'll quickly
finish off with some highlighter which
is soft and gentle by Mac and I just
don't rate this because I think that
stuff is that's the money to be quite
honest like if you want something very
natural you will love this like when I
selected mat for yourself so many of
these especially for like young girls
who wanted quite a natural highlighters
to work like school or like daytime or
something just really natural as I said
like three times this is about 24 pounds
or something I would say and I just
think like for the money
you can get stuff it's way back I mean
it's not bad don't mean it's not a bad
product but I just don't reach for it
because I prefer like say as indication
on mary-lou manizer
or like my Anasazi of helots so okay for
eyeshadow this is a quad by Tom Ford
this is in the shade orchid orchid haze
it just looks like so I just over eight
this for the price mostly like this
quite is about sixty five pounds or
something which I mean is what about
sixty five divided by four weight like
that it's basically sixteen pounds per
eyes shadow which i think is crazy I
didn't buy this full price I actually
bought it running you through as much
because I got discount on sa lot of
products because Maki is part of Estee
Lauder so I probably paid like thirty
five pounds or something this so I
didn't pay for pressure and I wouldn't
pay full price for it don't get me wrong
the color scheme in it is lovely I
absolutely love this like deep purple
down here but I just think like for the
price like there's one swatch times like
the swatch of that one down there and
then that's it on my skin like us you
can't they just don't I just don't
perform I'm like where is Pacific and
this one here one at the top we've got
that on there which is like that which
looks really pretty but then again you
swatch it on the skin and I'm like where
the is it you know purple I do
really like it's like a beautiful of
deep purple eyeshadows is wanting in
makeup where I feel like you really have
to outdo yourself as a brand to let's be
the best because now that we have things
like makeup geek and which is like what
six panning eye shadow and the
pigmentation and like the blend ability
is like it just shits on there again
like make sure at this is I feel like
it's sometimes difficult to make a full
lot just using these fall colors but
we're going to do it anyway and I'm
going to use this one in the crease as
like the transition shade top this one
on the outer corner and then maybe like
to choose a mix of these two on the lid
and just see how it goes I mean when you
pay in 65 pounds requirement you're
obviously paying to the name do not mean
you obviously pay in because it's a Tom
Ford product and nothing else in my
opinion and then it's going to go back
in line moves out like they blend nicely
but can you see how that just blended in
to kind of nothing now like when I first
it
so that's the pigmentation when you
first lay it down and then as soon as
you start winning it out it just
disappears this is like my issue with
them I think even if I was like Beyonce
and I had like tons of money I
would still want to have a full palette
of makeup weak shadows and like this
quite you know scarlet I picked out is
one by mark this is lair pro beyond
twisted lash I just don't get this
mascara at all like I just it's quite in
episode innocence that like it burns
Jesse that was right I swear to God I
say Sony was wrong oh my god like
basically they brought this out and it
has like a bendy one so it's good for
like getting right in the inner corners
themselves I'm pretty sure that was like
the idea of it and put the ones I'm just
like what are you supposed to do this
like it just understand I thought was
going after that have a lot of mascaras
and I just feel like it can bring in
more mascaras owl and it really just
confuses me because they have some
mascara that I absolutely love like I
really like my favorite Mac mascara is
Zoom lash I use on my bottom lashes as
well and I think it's incredible like
it's so good at like volumizing and
lengthening those things like in extreme
dimension which is really intense it's
like a really intense like thickening
volumizing mascara it was really popular
when I used to work that and it was
great as long as like you didn't apply
too much and let it go clumpy but it was
so good at really just making your
lashes look black and say let me bring
things like this now and I'm just like
why when you've already got like good
mascara okay last thing we have left to
do is lip lip product that I picked out
for this video is by Kylie cosmetics I
have spoke about this a couple of times
and I've used it twice and like not
another time since because my issue with
it is that it believes really badly and
I love the liquid lipstick so kind of
like I love her lip kit I think the nude
ones in particular I love exposed and is
it called exposed
I'm pretty sure it's called expose
exposed and candy kay I like to sort of
like Dolce K and the more nude ones like
that what the dark ones I just have
issues with it because I feel like you
have to build up the liquid lipstick a
bit more because they go kind of patchy
and stuff and they just like the other
ones you can do like once watching the
drama
a season you sleep they'll often sort of
like blended a bit more otherwise they
look patchy and this please really badly
on my skin like when I say it bleeds you
know and you've got like a lipstick on
and all your edges are really clean and
like really clean cut but then halfway
through the day they sink into all the
fine lines around your mouth that is
what this does to me like all the time
like this one or two times I wore it so
I'm going to align my lips first don't
get me wrong it's a beautiful color like
a really beautiful red like a deep
classic red and values can't wear it
anymore because it bleeds if you like
there's other ones that do the job like
the one by Mac which is one of the
rapture marks in the shade I think it's
the shade dance with me I'd say it's
like a similar color because they're
both like cool toned reds and that will
just work and lasts so much better can
you see like like ignore the part
because I had to start this definitely
as that's my fault but in the center
like here converts like da but you can
see the shade like the areas that
lighter that like that and then the area
that's a bit darker because it's just
not like it's not done like an even
swatch of it don't get me wrong I can
appreciate that darker colors are
probably harder to do and what look at
it I like mmm yeah this is pretty much
the finished look like it doesn't look
bad as you can see and said in the intro
I wasn't aiming for it to look bad or
hoping that it was going to look bad
these products as I said aren't
necessarily should see products they
just aren't my favorites and they're
just not stuff that I reach for or
particularly rate because I think
there's stuff in my collection that
works
bust it for me and but yeah let me know
in the comments if you tried any of
these products yourself so I'm just like
swinging on the shelf
how do you know if you tried any of
these products yourself and your
thoughts on them and and we'll have a
chat about what we don't rate and thank
you so so much for watching I love you
guys premier and back and I will see you
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
