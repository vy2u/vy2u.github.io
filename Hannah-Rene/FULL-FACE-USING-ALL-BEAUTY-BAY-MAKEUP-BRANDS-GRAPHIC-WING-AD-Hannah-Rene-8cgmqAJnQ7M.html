going to be a get ready with me on it
this makeup look right here which is
something really different and fun for
me I'm just I'm loving it you're gonna
see throughout the video but I'm so
loving this look so this video is
actually in collaboration with bleach
eBay which you guys know I love piece
eBay I think my so far so this video is
basically celebrating at the new
campaign that they've got out which is
super bold super fun super edgy and it's
hashtag at queen bee bee bee bee is in
meet eBay you see what they did there
I'm gonna have all the details for the
campaign down below you might have seen
that advert a couple of times as well
because I know I've seen it on TV I
absolutely love it it is so forgetting
it call it basically all straw man and
just stop smashing up this department
store like it's such a fun and like bold
I bet so the whole aim with this is to
kind of revolutionize the sort of
traditional shopping experience for
consumers and you guys and stuff and
basically encourage you to kind of
unleash your creativity a little bit
more and try some new style kind of just
like venture out and be experimental
with makeup so there's five different
looks the look that I'm gonna be
recruiting is the Frankie look I've not
recruited it exactly because that is
already a tutorial and how to achieve it
I'll pop a picture in here of the law
and then I'll also pull up above the
actual shoot RL for the exact look so
it's kind of like this really bold like
graphic win but because this order you
choose her own it I kind of wanted to do
something a little bit different and
just kind of take inspiration from the
look itself so it's all about kind of
this block like dramatic winged eye with
like bits of neon pink so again I've
done like a graphic liner because I
wanted to kind of keep in line with the
look but I just did something a little
bit different to what the original is
but yeah huge thank you it's a BC Bay
for collaborating with me on this video
I really hope you guys like the look
that I came up with and if you want to
see how I achieve this look and have a
little chat with me and then it just
keep watching
okay so I've done up one eye off camera
just because I wasn't entirely sure what
kind of liner and stroke I was gonna do
so and you just want to practice one eye
off it but I found it I'm happy with the
way it came out so we're gonna do it
this side now okay so the first thing
I'm going to go in with is get brow by
understand
Hel's just to fill in the brows i never
film brows on camera anymore i don't
know why so in the actual like original
look they could use brow ways but i just
referred pill makes it fills my brows
and a little bit stronger i find so I
just had the weirdest experience right
so I started this video and then the
bathroom light was on next door so I
went outside like I went out with my
room to switch it off but you can hear
it
um because I was only running around the
corner I'd already saw a film and so
I'll it should just like run out and
then switch the light off and run back
into my room thinking the camera was
still gonna be sorry that was really
annoying that's okay I think you know
the camera was still gonna be filming
and I come back in my room literally ow
like five seconds just to switch the
light off my camera's like flicked off
why does it do that you know and the
files deleted okay so I saw my life I
was filming because I literally had my
mic on as well so I have the footage of
my mic but like my camera in the space
of me like going out of the room and
switching the light off in the bathroom
my camera I'd like switch off and
deleted the file that I just felt like
farter things though like how weird is
that
and then I'm just gonna pry the eyes
with some concealer so this feels really
weird but I literally did no eyeshadow
for this before I started the lineup
because obviously it's all about kind of
like the graphic wing and there's a bit
of eye shadow in the crease but that's
what we're gonna do at last so the first
thing that we're gonna go in with is the
morphe gel liner in the shade slate
which is just like a pure black so I'm
gonna take it out on a sigma e06 which
is like a tiny tiny little teeny
eyeliner brush because we want a
precision precision so I always start
with this section fess up to you how
thin or thick you make this line but
just remember that we are going in with
pink duh
so if you like your lash line section to
be quite thin then it definitely keep
this part thin I'm gonna do the wing
section so I just take like
good amount on the brush and then at
what I do with my thumbs
because I like to just squeeze off the
product either side and not just make
sure that it's like super sharp and no
excess products gonna like make the line
messy not gonna do it too long today
because again we're going in with the
pink of course jawline is actually
really nice it's like really smooth and
then if the pink shade this is like the
fun back so we're gonna go in with the
Geoffrey start liquid lipstick in the
shade dominatrix II is literally Bobby
painting in the original tutorial they
do actually also go in with the LA girl
line art maps I learned a pen in the
shade white because they actually do the
pink on top of the black but because
we're applying the pink to bare skin I
didn't use this step because it doesn't
need it it's like super opaque as it is
so I'm gonna take the applicator and I'm
just gonna basically pop some on the
back of my hand like so this is the
Sigma small eyeliner brush which is an
e-tag which as you can see again is
genuinely teeny tiny because we don't
really want like a wing shaped brush for
this we just want a really thin liner
brush to like act for precision and then
I'm gonna start with the above the
aligner section and then we're gonna do
the crease so don't worry if you get
this messy I don't because you can then
go back in with the black because
obviously the black is darker than the
pink so you can't correct with the black
afterwards you just want to make sure
that you got a good line like a good
stroke but about a pigmentation with the
pink and that's all you really need to
worry about like don't worry if you got
it on the line X it's not a problem we
can clean it up also what I'm doing is
every time I do a like a stroke every
time I do a little bit I basically go
onto my hand and just wipe it off with
the brush because what will happen is
the paint will mix in with the black
that's already laid down and you don't
want to obviously I transfer the black
on top so just make sure that you kind
of like wipe in you brush off and then
dipping back in it's like the clean bit
of pain I'm gonna start working on the
middle section like the crease so again
I'm just gonna get a little bit more of
the pink out and you kind of just want
to go back on yourself through the
crease basically follow the natural
shape of your crease
as you can see it's looking a bit messy
but it's fine so I'm first off going in
with a little round top brush again I'm
just going to clean up underneath a tiny
bit you don't have to do LOX we're gonna
smudge it and make it kind of like edgy
um well I'm just gonna clean up a little
bit underneath and we're gonna dip into
the visa and this pronounced visa this
is the low hem dream palette don't know
if I'm pronouncing that right but it's
the old shimmer palette which again it's
from beautybay I'm gonna use the middle
pink shade just to smudge that out and
make it kind of more neon and breaks
this is a little bit lighter than the
liquid lip I go in with a tiny bit more
concealer just a case of cleaning it up
now and just making it more intense than
you want to like I'm going to add a
little bit more of the pink as well okay
I'm gonna go and pop on it the other
lash which is this little guy so the
lashes that I've got on are Lily lashes
Jimmy cups I'm really sorry I know I
don't like 24/7 but honestly guys
they're just so fluffy like Colin so for
primer I'm gonna go in with the
illamasqua Hydra veil I think it's
called I've never used this before I
have to say Illamasqua is a brand that I
haven't really liked properly Brunton
see like I've not really tried a lot of
that stuff I saw this on the Beauty bait
website and it says it creates a radiant
finish and instantly rehydrates the face
oh my gosh
it's literally jelly I see you're not
gonna be able to see but it's like jelly
guys like I can't even
I hope I'm gonna show you but it looks
really interested in Soho my god this is
the weirdest thing if jelly definitely
made my skin really soft and like really
smooth now the foundation we've got
another new product so this is the LA
girl Pro coverage HD long wet
illuminating foundation I have heard so
many good things about this and you guys
have recommended it to me so many times
so I thought it would pick it up it's in
the shade one beige which is a little
bit dark so don't come for me okay so I
don't know how much you need I'm just
gonna like hope for the best
wow that is coverage okay that's like
it's like copyboy holiday is basically
I've never actually had a foundation
it's gonna sound mad but I've never
actually managed to use a foundation
where I'm doing one pump for the whole
face like that is crazy like I can't go
far how quick that covered and how quick
it blend it out like it didn't even need
effort or anything to blend out like I'm
sure it's healing that we're gonna use
is the Kevin a Quan Kevin Daquan I think
that's how you pronounce it this is the
arethe rulest Supernatural concealer and
I got the shade medium okay so this
claims to be a high performance
lightweight formula packs a punch with
the unique blend of complexion
brightening pearls high definition
pigments hyaluronic acid and natural
antioxidants so it's a medium coverage
it says and it's developed to give
optimal play time to blend correct
contour and perfect the skin seamlessly
like I said this is in the shade medium
and the only thing I wasn't like a
massive fan of was the fact that there
just wasn't not much of a shade range a
new product so I'm hoping they'll bring
more out providing it's like good and
stuff you know slap it oh you can see
her which is oxidized they're actually
already take it right up to the hairline
so it gives us like a nice left and also
right up to the nose definitely agree
that it's like a medium coverage because
it's not like super full but it is still
like covering relatively well this it's
like in the foundation of bare my skin
actually looks really good on camera hey
guys I might have just found a new like
fave combination here and I've got that
concealer is stunning you know I'm not
being funny but Kevin Huong you need
more shades in this because this is good
okay and if the rest of the skin it's
something that I really wanted to try
out was the core effects illuminating
setting powder so this is a loose powder
but I just love the idea of an
illuminating loose powder because the
one thing that I do find having drier
skin is that loose powders can sometimes
just make me look a little bit chalky a
little bit dry bit flaky
especially when it's time I'm not trying
to go for that look so this is in the
shade light again
not many SHINee's in this so we're gonna
see how it goes you know these lids
really annoying
I actually ended up cutting one off my
two-faced things like how are you
supposed to get products out with
without making a mess I know into
something I'm just not now
see ya just lightly top that on oh I
like here i'm literally live in for this
skin like that powder has just finished
everything perfectly because it's not
dyed it's not like dim down the kind of
like luminosity of the foundation if
anything it's just giving it more like a
subtle glow but it has set everything in
place so obviously when we do brunch in
this drop it'll still like apply really
well the powders and i'm table on the
skin may as well finish off the skin was
its gel here so the brands are that I've
got is my sealer this is the stay cold a
contour and bronze up for face and body
in the shade medium oh my gosh love
already Nala not being funny well I'm
just like living the highlighting kit
that they used in the original look is
the Anastacio glow kit which is this lon
which one is this the ultimate glow
which or this came up at Christmas time
last year on it is shown in I always
forgot to reach for this one for some
reason I don't know why these ones are a
little bit more glittery done the other
glow kits that uh Nastasia does so just
by my mind let me use the shade white
Sun which is this one in the middle and
mix a tiny bit of the shade snow I'm
just gonna lightly dust just a light
dose to feel like we should finish off
the eyes so in my hat I wanted to make a
really smoky lower lash line I think I'm
still gonna do that I kind of like that
it's quite dainty at the minute so if
you want to leave it like this
by all means just put a little bit of
like I don't know pink eye shadow a
little bit like a neutral eyeshadow in
the mascara and this would be like the
finish I love I'm just gonna take the
bronze if it's actually so I'm gonna
take the Stila bronze that we just use
I'm just gonna smudge this onto the the
lower lash line and this is kind of
gonna help just like mush everything
together I feel like you always want a
base color on the lower lash line I'm
gonna take it kind of far down because I
mean if we're gonna do this we're gonna
go
and do this and then we're gonna need a
black eyeshadow this so I'm gonna dip
into my morphe what is this 25 a palette
which just has a block down here any
black eyeshadow will do and then you
just want to take any black eyeliner and
just apply this in the waterline
then you want a flat definer brush this
is the Sigma II 15 which is just a flat
definer we're just gonna stop kind of
smooch in the liner down I'm just gonna
go back in with the brush a blending
brush no additional product really just
to soften the black eyeshadow another
thing in the original look as well that
I'm gonna take like inspiration from is
the kind of pop of light blue sorry the
kind of pop of blue on the inner kind of
part of the inner corner so I'm gonna go
back into the B's op highlight and just
use the light pale blue that is that I'm
just gonna use a tiny bit and that's
kind of gonna be like a in a corner
highlight almost which I know seems a
little bit weird and it just makes
something a bit different kind of like
contrast with the pink okay and then we
just want to finish off with lower lash
mascara okay and thence you finish off
we're just gonna do lips so I'm first
gonna use a lip pencil they didn't use
this in the original look but you guys
know I have to use a lip liner it's just
like my go-to and so I'm going to use
the jarred cosmetics lip pencil in the
shade Luna and just outline my lips with
that and then gonna go in with one of
the Stila stay all day liquid lipsticks
and also a dose of colors lip gloss
which has been my favorite gloss ever
for a while now since the Senate or vice
and the Shay don't dress and I'm just
obsessed so I'm gonna use those three
full the lip combo and that will pretty
much be the finished look okay so this
is the finished look I really hope you
all love it as much as I do I'm honestly
obsessed with that scan the eyes to let
everything I'm just blown away by how
much I loved every single product
obviously some of them I have used
before and but in terms of the ones that
I didn't use before I'm just so blown
away by how much I love them I really
hope you like my take on the Frankie
look as I said there will be a link
while there was a link in the intro to
the original tutorial and which was of
course studying I just thought I'd do
like a little bit a spin on it and do my
kind of like twist you just thank you

me on this video and a huge thank you to
