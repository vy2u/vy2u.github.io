going to be a get ready with me
obviously my throat is still not
completely recovered but we're gonna try
it and chat through this and it's really
early in the morning as well so I'm
trying to be like a little bit quiet but
today me and Kaine I go into Cardiff
which I am so excited about so I'm
pretty much doing like a full face of
glam I'm gonna do my hair and stuff on
camera as well and you like curls
because I know I could have you had
questions about the curls I did in my
last video so I'm gonna show you the
curling wand and the clips I used as
well oh my gosh my voice is like really
gone you know when you're just like
haven't spoke come on in and you didn't
expect your voice to sound like this
I've started off with a bad face as well
just because I thought it would be funny
to do it this way I kind of like to
switch up between like starting with the
finished look and starting with the bare
face so today I'm starting with a bar
face as you can see I think that's
pretty much it so I'm gonna go ahead and
do brows I've come up because I've
started doing that recently you don't
really enjoy it so I'm gonna do that and
prime my eyes and I'll be back in a
second okay so brows are on and I've
just prime my lids with some concealer
palette that I'm gonna go in with is the
Jaclyn hill and morphe palette I asked
on Twitter what you guys wanted to see
and I did Apollo with about four pallets
this was the most voted for although
other people kind of like I don't really
want you to use Lux I've seen it all
over Instagram on YouTube which is
completely fair enough why isn't i
coming up focus in hello but don't feel
like you have to use this i'm gonna do
kind of something quite neutral and
stuff i'm not gonna use any of like the
bold colors so you could pretty much use
anything like a Nastasia palette i'm
another morphe palette i know i predict
a palette like there's so many other
things that you could use makeup geek
shadows don't feel like you have to use
what i'm using so this is what it looks
like i don't know what the names are
obviously this isn't a new packaging
with the names on the back so i'm just
gonna be pointing to them but the
transition i'm gonna be using this shade
here which is in like the middle of the
top row i'm gonna take it on a Mac to t4
finally got around to cleaning my makeup
brushes I hope you guys are probably
guess I'm the worst for like cleaning
them I'm not even gonna lie so I'm just
popping that straight in the crease just
going up from inner to outer but even
though these are dry yeah I washed them
last night so fingers crossed an hour I
have used this palette once already I
don't know if I just mentioned that and
so far I liked it but I kind of have
mixed opinions on air like some of the
mats are really quite dry which I didn't
expect like I just came to the
conclusion that because they wanted to
make them as pigmented as possible like
it's a compensate for that some of them
do just feel quite dry on the eyes which
isn't necessarily like that much of a
bad thing but it's just something that I
didn't expect to be not I mean honestly
the one weekend that I've had plans for
like ages like me and Kane of had plans
for over a month now and of course I'm
sick I'm just gonna jug that up a little
bit towards the brow this brush is like
then I'm next gonna go in with Oh watch
my go in with next I think I want to try
a bit of this shade here and maybe mix
it with like this one and I've just
switched you a backstage beauty brush
again I'm just sweeping that up I'm
gonna be quick like me today because I'm
not gonna do I'm not gonna clean up with
a wipe if you not me I'm just gonna
create the wing myself I'm just using
like a bunch of shades to basically just
like deepen the crease deepen the crease
anyone else try this palette yeah I'm
sure like a lot of you will have it now
because it is available on beautybay but
if you have it let me know what you
think
and let me know what your favorite
colors are the mix their shade here and
this shade here they're unlike the third
row and they kind of like the matte
burgundy colors first are just gonna
place up that I feel like you guys have
seen me do this technique like a million
times now and then with the angle of the
brush just gonna start winging it out a
little bit
and then just gonna go back in with a
blending brush just soften no additional
product I'm gonna go in with a little
bit of this shade which is kind of like
a deep purple I'm just gonna do the
exact same thing over top I'm not gonna
do it like ice high up but just to kind
of like deepen at the outer corner so
I'm just gonna put it better first
okay so there's a bit of fallout from
that one which I'm just gonna clean up
now now I'm just gonna go in a little
bit more with like the transition colors
just to make sure we're not like losing
that sorry I can't be like as chatty in
this video but like every time I talk I
cough so I'm gonna take the darker
shades and pop those on the inner corner
as well just with a sigma e45 this stuff
is like super easy because you literally
just kind of stumped them there and then
just with like the very darker one is
one like the dark purple if I'll just
finish this eye on camera and then do
the rest
off-camera okay and I fall alone I'm
just gonna take this kind of gold shade
down here I'm just gonna use that with a
bit of fix+ on a two for to by ma I'm
gonna mix in a tiny bit of this color as
well just because I don't want it to be
like - gold because the top that I'm
wearing is like silver so okay so that
is it one eye done pretty much I'm just
gonna do the same on the other eye and
then I'm gonna do lashes and stuff and
we'll go on to skin okay so onto skin
I'm gonna prime it with the smash box at
primer water I feel like I've been using
this so much recently but I'm honestly
obsessed like I love it so much my voice
is like mysteriously cleared up a little
bit that you always need to let this dry
a bit as well because it is almost like
a spray it's quite Wow
so I always wait for it to get a bit
tacky before I actually go in with
foundation for foundation I'm going to
be using Georgie
I'm so sorry but I promise next time I
use a different foundation but again
because I'm going out tonight I want to
make sure I'm using something that I
love and honestly like I swear by this
it's like the best thing ever
no it's expensive but this is the first
one I ever got I bought it back in like
what I bought it back in like February I
didn't try it until about May June time
probably um what was it later than that
I feel like it was like June time and I
use it pretty much every single time I
do my foundation and I'm still going
strong with that oh my go-to also guys
finally got my nails done
I've got them done unlike Thursday and I
actually feel like a new woman like I've
just been like nails buns everywhere
 see like I'm just using the NARS
radiant creamy and top shape tape my
tart shape too has finally arrived
I'm so excited to try it and I want to
save it fries like a testing video or a
full face first impressions let me know
what you want with it because whatever
you want me to film with it I'll do and
but I didn't want to include it in this
video just because one I don't know if I
like yeah obviously like I don't want to
use it when I'm like going out and I
need my makeups look good when I don't
know if I like it or not and two I do
want to save it for like a testing video
of some sort like a full phase first
impressions ultimately okay back onto
eyes I'm just gonna mix or like a
transition colors that we used and then
just the darker ones as well
and then you can either leave that as it
is or put something in the waterline I'm
just going to do a brown in the world
slides today just because we've got no
black on the eyes but if you want to do
black then by all means do then lower
lash mascara because always feel like
this is really completes the eyes and
then of course in a corner highlight you
guys already know you know what it is I
finished off the skin I'm gonna do a
bronzer first I'm gonna whip out an
oldie but a goodie I'm gonna be using
the Mac mineralized skinfinish is used
to absolutely swear by these I still do
really like them I just forgot to reach
for them so I've got medium dark here
and then dark here and which I'm just
gonna mix together feel like bronze is
one of my favorite things when it comes
to makeup like just makes you face look
so much better
and then a highlighter I thought it
would try out something at news today
which I've not tried before and this is
the over Oprah Oprah in collaboration
with nikkietutorials one about
highlighters in the shade Global's
I'm not trying any a beach yeah but
every time I see people like use them I
just fall in love like they look stone
in oh hello I'm gonna mix in a tiny bit
of the lighter one which is glazed donut
because like that one's almost too dark
for me which is crazy honestly like what
the hell they're actually blind in yeah
that dark one kind of regret using that
long because it's actually a bit dark
for my skin but oh well and I I'm gonna
go in with a blush I'm just gonna use
California by benefit just to bring a
bit of color into the cheek spot lips
I'm first gonna go in with a tiramisu
lip liner by Rimmel which is just like a
really lovely nude color I'm just gonna
use this to line my lips and then for
lipstick I'm gonna throw it way back
again an oldie but goodie and use method
by Mac which is one of my favorite nude
lipsticks of all times
obviously you can tell by now we're
going for nude and then to finish off
I'm gonna try a new product by glam glow
which is called their plump Regis gloss
lip plumper treatment so these come in
different colors and stuff and this one
is in the shade custom couch is that
right I don't I rush you know um but
I've not tried these yet and they look
really interesting so I'm gonna give
this one a go today I wasn't like the
biggest fan of the applicator for that
gloss I really like the color and it
smells very minty Oh much and it's gonna
get quite singly in a sack I can feel it
getting bingley already and I really
love the color but the applicator was
really way it was like really skinny
plastic I don't know but this is the
finished look I actually really love it
now that it's all done and finished like
I said I'm quickly going to show you how
I do my curls as well and what products
I use for that so we're gonna get
straight onto that I will have to leave
my curls in so there's not going to be
like a finished finished look but later
tonight I'll get came to take some clips
of everything put together it's like the
out there and then you can see the final
hair
and because I do like to leave them in
pain curls all day just because my hair
is so long they drop out so quickly
otherwise so that's a good tip got
really long hair and it's quite thick
like mine when you do your curls make
sure you leave them in like pins like
clips for ages like as long as possible
and so I'm going to do that now and then
I'll show you the rest later on first
products that I'm going to use which
isn't actually to do with the curling
I'm just going to go in with the L'Oreal
dark iced brown magic retouch root spray
not obviously like an essential stuff if
you don't dye your hair like me but my
roots a girl my roots are coming through
so oh it's a bit of a messy product
that's the only thing but I'm just gonna
kind of spray it where my hair is
exposing me see what I mean like not
know thank you
yeah you can see that just conceals your
roots which is very handy where there
not been done and then on to heat
protectant I'm gonna use the John Frieda
or Fredo John Frieda I think Frizz Ease
heat to be protecting spray just
concentrating this on my ends because
I'm not really gonna do too high up
today I'm just gonna do loose curls and
the one that I'm using is by Noomi Noomi
I think that's how you say it and I want
to know what style of one this is but
I'll link it down below because
beautybay very kindly sent it over and
this like the other day was my first
time using it when I did my hair for
hours and I absolutely loved it like it
did so did such a good job I need to
remember not to touch my trees now cuz
again that stuff will like stain now
like I said if you've got long hair like
me you want to make sure that you graph
in everything in so I'll link these
clips down below they're from Amazon and
I usually use bobby pins for this but
bobby pins are really fiddly because you
have to like open them up with like your
teeth or your nails and then slot them
in or as these are like pinche clips so
you literally just like pinch one like
pop it in the curl and it's drawn I'm
just gonna do quite big sections today
just because they're gonna stay in the
grips for a while so I'm just gonna I'm
literally gonna use like massive chunks
and I'm just gonna rub it towards my
face first around the barrel and then
you just want to hold it there
in place how looks really dark today
like it looks black on camera and I've
not even read I'd it like it's really
not that dark yeah honestly leaving your
hair in grips just saves you life
because it keeps the curl in longer and
it means that you don't have to do them
as me right and then what it drops make
sure you catch it in in your hands like
so and then all I'm gonna do is I'm just
gonna first off get that in my hand like
so then I'm just gonna take a grip I'm
gonna need quite a few groups for this
one I thinks it's quite a big curl but
I'm just like clipping it from the
bottom and then I'm just gonna do the
exact same but clip it from the top like
so and then you can kind of leave it
there and it'll just like stay in place
all day and then this one's going
towards the face I just kind of
alternate them dependin okay and then
once you are at this stage and you've
done half your head I'm just gonna take
some hairspray this is the Loreal and
satin extra-strength whole exaggerate
cetera I'm just and that's pretty much
it I'm gonna leave that in all day and
obviously just do the other side of
camera and then I'll be back in a sack
so hair is pretty much done obviously
this is just gonna stay in all day
whilst it kind of sets in place and like
I said it will just make it last a lot
longer because my curls are a nightmare
otherwise they just will not stay and
this is pretty much the finished look
obviously it's not like the finished
finished look because the hair and the
app it's not done but like I said I'll
include some clips of that hair so you
can see the actual everything put
together finished look how many times
does a finish it looks like honestly I
really hope you all enjoyed this video
sorry it wasn't super high and I
literally like obviously I want to
include you didn't one of edit it but I
genuinely like to strike off in every
single time I started speaking and I've
always seems to like I've cleared up a
little bit now I don't know if it's just
because I just woken up as well when I
started filming but my voice was just
not cooperating and my cough was not
cooperating so I'm sorry it wasn't like
that chassis I'm gonna film another like
chatty got ready with me soon and do
like a story time and combination so
it's a little bit more interesting and
things like that but hopefully you
enjoyed watching me do this makeup and
let me know what you think of it in the
comments and let me know what you think
of the jack and help palette because I
would love to know if any of you have
there yeah I love you guys some in the
back a million times elbow thank you so
much for watching and
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
