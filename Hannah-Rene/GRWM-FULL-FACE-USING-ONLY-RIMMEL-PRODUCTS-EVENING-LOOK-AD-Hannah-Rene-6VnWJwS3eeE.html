a video on this look right here so this
is a makeup tutorial uses all Rimmel
products if you follow me on snapchat
and like other social medias then you'll
know that I was recently on the Rimmel
road trip in Manchester which was so
excited representing Manchester you know
I was actually on the road trip with
Victoria from in the fro and honestly we
had so much fun that she's one of the
nicest people I've ever matched she's
just so lovely you actually lived in
London now so she got to come back to
Manchester and we just explored for the
day and then we went and had some food
and some drinks in the evening it was so
much fun I'm like honestly she's so
lovely and the people at Rimmel are so
lovely as well as it was such a nice day
as well as exploring Monta so we
actually created two looks with Rimmel
products so we a daytime look which was
sort of like a more natural look man was
like minimal and fresh it was like super
glowy skin and nude lip and not really
like a lot going on in the eyes and then
at nighttime you know it was all about
the eyes so I did pretty much this look
right here this is what the truth or I
was going to be on so if you want to see
how I achieve this look then just keep
watching and make sure when you are done
watching this video you go and watch
mine and Victoria for my road trip in
Manchester because much of this
obviously were supposed to be so you
want to see it I'm sorry I love you and
I will speak to superzero and I look
okay so we're going to start with skin I
am using the last unit finished primer
by Rimmel which is my favorite primer
that they do purely because it feels so
hydrating and so moisturizing on the
skin it's quite sick which I really like
because it literally just feels like a
moisturizer and it creates like a really
good barrier between your actual skin
and the makeup that you're going to
apply also feels quite tacky so you just
know that it's going to stick really
well on top which we all won then I'm
going to go in with the new wake meal
I'm super chic I'm vitamin C foundation
so this is just like a new edition of
the original and I love it with this
brush originally I use it with a buffing
brush and I tried like I'm pushing it
into the skin and it didn't work as well
as it did here but using this this brush
like a sort of stippling brush it
applied beautifully like honestly I
can't tell you how stunning it looked it
just makes your skin appear like really
luminous and healthy so like the daytime
because it's not too heavy but it
definitely does give you like a decent
amount of coverage as you can tell so
I'm just using the shade 3
three something never there I'll leave a
list with all the products shades and
stuff down below and then we're going to
go in with the wake me up concealer and
also the match perfection loose powder
just to do under the eyes and to set
there and I'm using the lightest shade
just because I like to highlight a
little bit more so again perfect for my
own dry because like I said these
formulas are super hydrating so don't
feel dry in under the eyes at all
perfect for daytime because they last
all day and they just leave your skin
and it feel is so healthy and luminous
and lovely and glow in it which is what
we all want so I'm just swapping that
out with a Beauty Blender because I
think the best ways to use this
concealer is with a sponge then I'm
doing the rest of my skin after I've set
that with the loose powder so I'm just
balancing out the highlight across the
face because we don't want to just have
really light under eyes then I'm going
in with my favorite powder like pretty
much of all time this is the Rimmel stay
matte you guys know I love this part of
so much it's so affordable and so good
honestly it's stunning so this isn't the
shade that I usually use this has a
slight tint to it but it goes really
well with the foundation shades so again
it will be down below then for eyes I'm
using the magnifies eye primer which
I've recently discovered and I'm really
enjoying using because it works so well
as a primer it just evens everything out
on the eyelids and like in the crease
and stuff and then when you say I just
set it with this a matte palette that I
just used all over the face and you can
see the difference like it really does
just create like a really lovely blank
canvas to work with
then before we go in with the actual
palette we're going to use and going in
with the bronzer that we're going to use
on the rest of the skin so this is the
natural bronze bronzer and I'm just
using this as a crease color because as
you can see this makes the most
beautiful warm crease color ever like
it's honestly stunning not only is that
fab bronzer but it works so well in the
crease and just because this palette
this is the magnified palette I can't
remember this shade name but like I said
that we've done below and it doesn't
have a particularly warm transition
color so I just wanted to put something
in the crease just a that was started
and as you can see I'm just taking like
I think it's like the fifth Street alone
maybe it's one of the darker matte
shades and I'm just going to start
popping this on at the outer corner as
you can see it's got beautiful
pigmentation and I just basically apply
it with a table brush and then I go back
in with my blending brush just apply
back into the warm crease color these
two colors worked so well together
honestly match made in heaven so I'm
just popping that on the outer corner
blending it until I am happy with the
way it looks and then I'm going to go in
with one of the shimmery sort of gold
colors on the lid again it has a
beautiful amount of paper patience I'm
just popping that on the lid and
blending it into the other colors then
we're going to move on to eyeliner this
is optional if you don't feel
comfortable doing eyeliner then don't
feel like you have to do it just stick
with the shadows if that's what you
would prefer and but I love doing a
winged liner for an evening look so I'm
just using these scandalized Micra liner
eyeliner which is a pen liner as you can
see this in the exaggerated liner from
Rimmel and my favorites because they are
so intensely black like them the
blackest liners I've ever worked with
this so good and they also just glide
really well on the skin like they don't
drag or anything like that it just
create a really nice wing so I'm just
doing that on both eyes there and then
onto lower lash line and just popping
the bronzer that I used in the crease
underneath on the lower lashes as well
and then I'm also going to use the
darker shade that we used from the
palette as well just to make sure that
everything balances out on the bottom
the same way it does on the top and I'm
only going to use the darker shade about
two-thirds of the way in so I'm not
going to take it all the way into the
inner corner just because I want is like
a little bit of definition on the outer
portion of the eye then we're going to
go in with mascara sorry this is the
volume shake it's a new one from Rimmel
really cool mascara because you
basically like shake it up and you can
hear the product like moving around in
the salt container and it just helps to
make sure that your mascara doesn't dry
up or anything like that really good it
feels quite wet when you first apply it
but it dries it just keeps your lashes
in place all day and it doesn't clog
mine together which I really love
because my lashes is so high maintenance
I swear and then we're going to do
eyebrows so I'm using a pencil first
because if you see my brow tutorial you
will know I like to go in with a pencil
then a powder then it's something to set
which I know again is really high
maintenance but it's just the way I like
to achieve my brow look so I'm using the
pencil size to create a little bit of
definition and also just to create like
a creamy base for the shadow to apply
and so I'm just using this mostly in the
arch and then just flicking it
throughout the front as well then I'm
actually going to use the same shadow
that we
used on the eyes I'm going to use this
as a brow color I know it looks kind of
purply but because the pencil that we
use is kind of warm and more like of
like a warm toffee Brown and they just
work really well together and like the
purple doesn't come through too much in
the brows which I really love it's kind
of just to add like an extra tone and an
extra bit of like definition and also
just to shape them a little bit more and
add like hair like strokes as you can
see me doing here which is what I do
with powder I just feel like it works
really well then we're going to go in
with this product which is actually
upside down this is the browser this way
and it's like a brow powder in a sort of
liner container sorry if you can hear my
cat moving she's been high maintenance
but it works really well so just add an
extra bit of definition and just to set
the brows in place which is exactly what
I use it for and yeah that is my brows
completed then back on surveys I'm using
the same bronzer that we used on the
eyes so this is the natural bronze just
happiness on the skin to add a little
bit of warmth and then I'm going to go
in with the Kate Rimmel kit this is in
the shade coral glow I believe using the
contour shade first I feel like the
contour shade in this and the bronze sky
use work really well together because
the definition whereas the bronze that
adds and the warmth and the sort of glow
to the skin and then we're going to go
in with a highlighter
I love the highlights is so much like
it's so good like this whole palette is
really handy because it's just like
everything in one place but as you can
see like it just looks stunning on the
skin
like coming out I was just like now stop
I'm done I'm done with the day goodbye
and but honestly like it's such a good
little palette so I'm just popping this
on the high points of the face and then
also Cupid's bow brow bones you know the
drill then on to lips I'm using one of
the last time to finish lip liners by
Rimmel you guys know they do some of my
favorite lip liners of all time they're
so creamy and so easy to work with this
one is in the shade tiramisu and it
makes salty perfect nude lip so I'm just
sort of lining and over drawing my lips
ever so slightly and then we're going to
go in with the Cape and number 40
lipstick which is a lovely nude lipstick
it reminds me so much of like other
high-end lipsticks that I have in a
similar shade and obviously it's Rimmel
and the price is right so it feels nice
and moisturizing on the lips
well blend like a dream into the liner
the liner and the lipstick are just a
match made in heaven as you can see and
yes this is pretty much it I do also add
a little bit concealer to the center of
the lip just a nice trick to add a
highlight to the middle as well and that
is pretty much the finished look okay so
I just realized I forgot science right
so I'm just going to quickly do that now
yeah this is the insta-fix can go to in
water primer and setting spray love this
still like I said it is a prime result I
just leave it in the sense right it
smells like cucumber it's so soothing on
the skin and I feel like it's really
going to like my skin type which is like
normal to dry because it definitely adds
like a lot of hydration as well as that
there so I'm just gonna you know do the
bead advising going into a stay but you
know what
I can't so this is the finished look I
really hope you all love this video with
