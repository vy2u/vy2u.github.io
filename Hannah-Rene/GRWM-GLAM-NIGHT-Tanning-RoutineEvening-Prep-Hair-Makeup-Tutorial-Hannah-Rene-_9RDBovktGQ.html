going to be a get ready with me on this
makeup look like here I'm also going to
be showing you my hair like how I
achieve this look like her file is not
pretty much killed it like less item
line and I'm going to show you my
tanning routine because I've never
actually shown that in a video before
and I don't want to make it like a whole
separate video so I thought I would just
like integrate it into this get ready
with me so hopefully you find it useful
as well yeah it's a pretty standard
glove look it's just like a smokey eye a
winged liner and nude lip and things
like that I have got a hair don't I have
fun in my house and like really bright
formal looks that I want to do soon
because obviously like I feel like I
always do Mutual's and stuff on my
channel so don't worry there is
something a different comment so you
want to see how we achieve this makeup
look and also my tips and tricks for
tunning then it just keep watching so in
terms of evening prep the night before
this is what I like to do my tanning
routine because I personally love
sleeping in tan and using the products I
can sleep in because I feel like it
develops really well over night so the
best thing that we want to do before we
actually apply tan is to have a bath or
a shower completely up to you which one
you have but it's really important to
exfoliate your skin and just because
turnip lies it's so much better when you
do so for facial exfoliation I'm using
the Loreal
pure clay glow scrub which looks like so
and then I'm also using it the soap &amp;amp;
Glory scrubber of your life and for the
rest of the body I just think it's so
important to exfoliate your skin as I
said because it just removes any dead
skin which sounds really grim I know
just removes any sort of dead layers of
skin and just helps to make sure that
everything applies really lovely on top
so I'm having a nice little bubble bath
there and then I'm going to start with
the L'Oreal pure clay scrub I just love
using this because it's almost like a
facial wash and a scrub in one so it
just has two jobs and one for me so
lovely on the skin and really good
exfoliation but it's not too harsh like
my skin is quite sensitive and this just
works really well so I absolutely love
it it just looks like so and then I just
rinse it off and then I'm just
exfoliating my legs as well
I do also shave my legs which is
obviously completely optional like
depending if you shave wax or don't do
anything
all that is up to you and I just like to
exfoliate before I shave because again
it just gets rid of any sort of like
dead layers and stuff before I actually
go in and shave my legs and then I just
go in with a body wash afterwards and
that is our prep done then for tan I'm
using the Loreal to bleem runs overnight
elixir self-tanning is sort of like a
serum I would say so like I said this is
like an overnight treatment this is what
my skin it looks like before and then I
just apply a couple of pumps onto a mix
and just begin blending it on to my neck
and body so I have been loving this
recently just because it is so hydrating
on the skin and it actually contains
hyaluronic acid and because your skin
like when you sleep in a lot of us don't
know this but your skin loses its like
four times as much water compared to any
other time of the day so it's so
important to keep your skin hydrated
overnight as you can see as well it does
have a color guard which is really handy
because you can see where you're
applying it so as you'll see in this
clip this is the color compared to my
neck and face before it develops I did
then pop it on my face as well because
it is suitable for face and body which
is really handy because I find it so
hard to find times as suitable for face
as well and another little tip is just
go on with another layer if you want a
darker more bronzed look which I always
do so I allow the layer the first layer
to dry and then I just go on with the
second one like so and this is pretty
much what it looks like so as you can
see it's lovely and natural and warm and
this again is the color guard on one arm
so you can see where you're applying it
which is really handy then it's just a
case of sleeping overnight in it and
when you have a shower in the morning
make sure that you don't use any so
glass another little tip just use like
lukewarm water and no soap and it will
rinse off and produce a really lovely
color as you can see here looks super
natural you can actually build this up
over a couple of days if you want a
darker look but for me this is fine so
that is like my tanning routine at the
minute let me know if you have any
questions about it down below then onto
her I am just starting off with some dry
shampoo just because the dry shampoo
museum by parties actually has like
volumizing agents in it so it's really
good for when you curl in your hair and
then I'm just going to go in with a
curling Tong and I'm taking quite large
pieces of hair as you can see there
like the newer way of how I tell my hair
if you like so I have shown this a
couple of times in tutorials but
nowadays I just take really big chunks
as you can see wrap it around the tongue
and then I just hold it for about 20
seconds or so because it is a little bit
chunkier than like a normal amount of
how you would use to curl and then I let
the curl drop and I basically am pin it
with bobby pins or grips whatever you
want to call them and I use about three
and the way I keep it in place is I just
pop my finger through the curl as you
can see me doing here I hold it in my
hand because if you let it drop straight
away then the curl will just fall out
completely but I just pop it in some
pins whilst I'm doing the rest of my
makeup and then when I sort of like
untangle them all at the end and sort of
take all the clips out the curls look
stunning and they last so much longer
like this is such a faster way of
curling your hair because you doing less
curls if that makes sense but they
honestly last so much longer than just
like curling it all and letting it drop
so I basically popped one from the
bottom to the top and then I do a clip
from the top to the bottom as you just
saw me do it there and then I do do one
more clip from the bottom to the top
again it just depends like how thick the
amount of hair is that you kaylynn and
nice pretty much it so I just do about
four of those on each side of my head so
I do like eight total super quick and
super easy to do and it just it's just a
really quick and easy hairstyle because
you're pretty much scallion but honestly
I promise if you have longer than thick
hair and you have issues with curls
staying in these will last all day and
they do last like the next day as well
which is rare for me because my hair is
just awful at holding anything so that
is pretty much what I'm doing here I
also alternate curls so I do one I do
one curl facing away from me and then I
do the next girl facing towards me and
this just helps when you basically take
all of the clips out and make sure that
they don't all blend together and it
just gives you have more texture so this
is what it looks like in the end we are
then ready to make up so I have primed
my eyes as you can tell and I'm going in
with the violet boss Holy Grail palette
because I realized I've not really uses
on camera properly before so and just
starting out with the transition shade
which is like a beautiful warm brown and
just popping this in the crease with a
big fluffy blending brush
know the drill and then I'm going to go
in with hashtag which is a more sort of
like yellowy warm transition color again
just building on top of that to create a
really lovely warm crease for us to work
with with the darker shades so just
blend that until you are happy with the
way it looks then we are going to go in
with wine and dine and honestly I was
not ready for how pink this eyeshadow is
that you're going to see my face in a
minute in the pan it looks like it looks
pink but it looks like a soft like
burgundy pink I would say and on the
skin it is like fuchsia bright-pink I
was like oh my goodness it thinks like
honestly is so pink so be what you're
going to use a smile and you don't and
you can see pink on the eyes I do sort
of like um nomic down a little bit in a
minute if you want to say I was like
girl what are we doing so I'm then going
in with the music like chocolate brown
shades if you like and to be honest
these two color combinations which so
well in the end because it created like
a really lovely deep purple as you can
see here so don't worry it's all fixed
eventually but if you do like pink
shadows and you'll love this palette
because obviously it's beautiful and
warm I just wanted something a little
more neutral ish for this look so in the
end we create this lovely deep purple
which actually reminds me a lot of
sketch by mark if anyone's ever use
eyeshadow and but yeah just build up
that color until you're happy with the
way it looks and then go ahead with any
of these sort of lit colors in the
palette so I'm using the shade it's
toffee spray my brush with fix+ and
again having a meltdown because my sixth
course is about about to run out
honestly it was just not me to say it
really wasn't so I'm just popping that
on the lid like so just starting on the
inner corner and then taking it about
half way inwards as you can see it's
just a beautiful warm gold and it
complimented the pink and the purple so
so well and so this is pretty much the
finished eyelook intensive shadow and
then just going to take a makeup wipe
and wipe away completely up to you how
you angle your shadow when you do this I
always do just underneath like where my
brow finishes and but it just depends
like how angled you in it so just finish
off by cleaning up and then we're going
to go in with winged liner I'm just
using a pen -
by laura geller i believe and then i'm
going to do the rest of the wing with a
liquid liner just because i put quite an
intense shimmer on the lid and i was
finding it difficult to get a liner that
would like cover the shadow if you know
I mean so I'm using one by Make Up For
Ever here which is just a black liquid
liner as I said and just creating a wing
don't be like you have to do this but I
just feel like it really creates the
finished look for the eyes then you just
want to finish off with mascara and
falsies so I'm just popping it on a
L'Oreal mascara this is the x51 that
they've recently brought out and I'm
just using the volumizing side just to
coat my lashes and make them nice and
black and sick and then we're going to
go in with some Lily lashes again
optional if you want to just stick to
mascara then by always do the Denver
primer I'm using my Tuesday's tangle by
x and honestly I hadn't used it in so
long and I feel like it's gone off
because it's not so weird on my skin
like it was really weird after a little
bit but either way it did the job and
then we're going to use the L'Oreal Lumi
magique foundation favorite affordable
foundation of all time you guys know I
love this foundation so much it works
perfectly with this brush as well and it
definitely works better with like a
stippling brush rather than a bottom
brush if that makes sense so I'm just
applying it all over the face much my
pan perfectly I was like oh my gosh like
much mean habit and it's probably the
first time I've ever filmed a video with
my foundation and my tan have it
completely much like I was so over the
moon so then I'm just doing concealer
just using the NARS radiant creamy and
just having this under the eyes just as
like a nice highlight to brighten and
lift so I'm dragging it all the way back
to the hairline like so and then you all
know my favorite way to blend up
concealer is with a damp sponge so I'm
just using a Beauty Blender it just
works really well because it absorbs any
excess product so it literally just
disperses at what you need and nothing
more because I don't know about you but
I have a habit to go really heavy-handed
with concealer under the eyes because I
want to make sure everything is covered
so I'm just dragging it back to the
hairline like so and then I just use the
same foundation brush that I used for my
foundation done and just because it
blends it and with the skin it really
lovely then set the rest of the face I'm
going to use Mac mineralize which I'm
not use it in forever but I do really
this powder as you all know just using
the shade medium and just set in the
face and then we're going to finish off
the eyes I'm using a black pencil liner
just on the waterline just because we
want to do something it nice and smoky
and then I'm gonna and then I'm going to
apply a whole of the shadows that we
used on the top half of the eye and the
crease and the lid and just apply these
on the bottom halves and starting with
transition and hashtag then using a
little bit of wine and down and the
darker ones as well and I'm also taking
in black eye shadow and just on this
stomping this is such a weird way to
explain it just pressing this sorry into
the lower lashes just to make sure that
that black in the waterline didn't look
too harsh then you just want to finish
it off with lower lash mascara it's so
important if you're doing black in a
little lash line because your lashes
honestly will just disappear otherwise
and then back on the face I did do brows
off camera I have a brow routine which
is on my channel if you want to know how
I fill those in I'm just using the
makeup forever Pro runs fusion and I'll
link the shade down below I think it's
cinnamon like two five one or something
but I do get a couple of questions about
it so I'll make sure that I pop it down
below just using this on the cheekbones
temples jawline all of that good stuff
just to warm up the face and add a
little bit of definition then we're just
going to finish up the skin with some
highlighter so I'm using the money
anyway and it Geoffrey start lips
highlighter which as you can see is
blend in honestly almost a little bit
too intense on my skin right now because
obviously I've got tan on and but I do
sort of blend it with a blush to sort of
match the highlight and the bunches
together afterwards so don't worry about
that but it really is a stunning
highlight and then to finish it off I'm
using the Kylie lip kit and exposed and
I'm starting with the lip liner and I do
really like these lip liners but they're
just so hard to sharpen like they remind
me a lot of the Mac Pro Longwear ones
and you never get them to a sharp tip
again so they can sometimes be a little
bit hard to work with but the actual
color I've exposed is stunning it's just
like a really beautiful warm and rich
brown like brownish nude as you can see
so just popping the actual liquid
lipstick on the center like so and then
just going in with the L'Oreal
infallible blush in the shade nude beige
just to tie the highlight and me it
burns it together it's like a really be
default coral color and they have like a
really lovely glow to them so that's
just to finish up the cheeks and then
I'm using one of the infallible glosses
which I believe is in the shade disco
ball slightly be useful finish to it as
you can see there's so much shimmer in
it stunning and I absolutely love it and
again I'll link it down below and I just
use that to finish up the lips then it's
just a case of pretty much taking all of
the pins out of the hair so this is what
the curls will look like in the end it
is a little bit fiddly but honestly it
is so worth it for the amount of time
with the curls last afterwards so as you
can see they just look nice and bouncy
and fresh and because I didn't kill them
too high up they're still really like
easy to work with and easy to sort of
style and things like that so it's
completely up to you how you style them
from there but I just sort of like brush
through them and that is pretty much it
so I really hope you all enjoyed this
