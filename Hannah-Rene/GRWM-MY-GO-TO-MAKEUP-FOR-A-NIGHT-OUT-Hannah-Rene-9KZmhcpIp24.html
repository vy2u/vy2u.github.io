makeup tutorial on this look right here
this is like my go to go in our makeup
look if you like as you guys uncertain
what you want to see and this was kind
of close this on one and but it was
pretty close to a full face of products
that I don't rate or like 1/4 into
products I hate so I'm probably going to
do that for like Sunday or next week or
something like that but yeah today's
video is a tutorial on there it's pretty
much like a warm very toned like
dramatic intense smoky eye there's no
wing liner with this because almost out
a lot of time I don't like to wear a
wing just because it sometimes transfers
underneath like on my lower lashline
throughout the night when I'm getting
like quite hot and bothered and like
laughing or blah blah blah so a lot the
time I don't wear a wing which is why
this look hasn't got what it is a very
intense dramatic look so if you're not
the sort of person who likes to mess it
make up any probably not going to like
it but there is a tutorial before this
one that's more of a natural look so
I'll leave that one down below and let's
see on the side somewhere here if you
want to outside instead this is a really
dramatic look I have done something very
intense and full coverage I actually use
the back foundation again which I used
in my full face at first impressions
last week because I've really been
enjoying this it's very thick so it's
perfect the notes out if you want to
them really and intense and for coverage
like a descent this is the same shade as
I used in the last one I've only just
ordered like the sort of correct
hopefully or like a lines to shade in
this so don't mind the fact that this is
going to be really dark on my skin when
I apply it like I know it is but I have
really been enjoying the coverage and
like the finish are a longevity
I never feel that we're longevity of how
long it lasts out and out like it's
really good to notes out because it just
sort of sticks to your skin like glue
we're going to start rambling because I
know I do that a lot in intro so if you
want to see how I achieve this makeup
then it just keep watching so starting
with eyes I'm just taking the modern
renaissance palette by anastasiya any
warm transition color will do we're just
popping this in the crease to help with
blending later on I'm just lifting my
brow just because I struggle to like
raise my eyebrows and I've got tight
boning it's really weird and I'm just
lifting it
I'll just make sure that again all the
nooks and crannies and just applying
this all the way through the crease from
the outer corner right the way into the
inner corner then I'm taking a pallet
they actually custom-made from mark it's
got a bunch of blushes in but I love
using these on the eyes the first one
that I'm taking I can't remember the
name of and but all of the shades will
be linked and listed down below if you
want any of them for yourself
and it's just like a really beautiful
warm sort of berries tone so I'm just
doing the exact same steps with this and
just popping it in the crease just over
lapping it over that and then orange
shade as well then I'm taking and red
ochre I think this is called I'm not
entirely sure but just like the red in
the palette any red again will do
popping is on the outer corner with a
2-1 7 this isn't a few one seven that
was a lie it's an e25 by Sigma and then
blending it out with a two to four I
believe by Mark and just sort of
building the color up here so I like to
go in with a more precise brush first
and just place the color where I want it
and then I go back in with a blending
brush just to make sure that everything
is seamless and smooth and we've got no
harsh edges my eye looks really weird
that it was not a flattering angle like
what the hell am i doing and but then
I'm just doing it on top of those with
two more of the blushes from mark again
I can't remember the names one of them
is fever and one of them has been up not
burn apple like red apple or something
but like I said they will be down below
as you can see I'm going for something
very warm and red just because I really
like these cards on my eyes and I feel
like on nights out they just really pop
especially in photos and stuff I feel
like this is really they just look
really good and see I'm just blending
that all together and as you can see I'm
just building up a ton of different
shades but you don't need to use this
much but I just think it helps with the
overall effect then I'm taking one of
the sparklers by makeup geek this is in
the shade stargazer and also some aqua
sealed by website makeup forever and
this just helps us sort of turn it into
more like a pace so I just put a drop in
the lid and then just sort of dunk my
brush in and Pat on half of the lid I
only take this from the inner corner
about half way in and I just use passing
motions I don't swipe just because this
gives a really beautiful pop and again
on the night out it really catches the
light like it's so good for pictures
when you've got flash on because you can
just see that tiny little bit of sparkle
so I'm just going back over with my
blending brush I've got no additional
product on it just to sort of soften the
lines because I don't want to like cover
it but I don't want it to look like a
harsh line I want it still sort of melt
into the other shadows then I'm taking a
black this is corrupt by makeup geek any
black will do and just add in a little
bit of Japanese into the outer corner
because I'm not doing a wing with this
look so I still want a little bit of
black on the go but nothing like too
intense because I don't really want to
lose the burgundy shades and I also
always line my upper lashline before I
put lashes on just because it really
helps me to sort of pot lashes down and
make sure that the sort of blend with my
natural ones like I have to have some
form of black especially if I'm not
doing a winged liner I'll always take a
black eyeshadow or a black pencil liner
and just pretty much tight line and my
upper lash line just to make sure that
everything it blends really well and it
helps to thicken the lash line up as
well then we are going in with a makeup
wipe and I'm just cleaning up the edges
as always it's like my favorite thing to
do and it's the best way for me to do my
makeup because it makes it allows me to
be messy but means that I don't ruin any
face makeup because we do that last then
I just popped on some Jade makeup lashes
by Lily lashes I like my favorites and
they're perfect for nights out because
they're so comfortable I literally can't
feel them on my eyes that always my
go-to then I'm doing and primers I'm
sure she's an idiot man post shave balm
I chose like really weird angles for
this tutorial I swear to God like don't
mind me I was just in my own little
world and I'm just hoping this all over
the skin and then the foundation I'm
using is the Becca ultimate coverage
amazing if you want something very sort
of like intensely pigmented as I said in
the intro this one's too dark for me
before anyone says anything like
obviously it's a couple of shades too
dark but I do blend it down the neck and
I promise it looks fine in the end
I know it's just like super dark but my
paler shade hasn't arrived yet I've
literally just changed color don't mind
me but we can all just giggle about it
but yeah it's so good for nights out
because it's really am full coverage but
it doesn't feel like there's a lot on
your skin you just don't need a lot I
feel like a lot of people don't like it
because it's so sick that they put too
much on so my best advice is to use the
tiniest bit and then blend it out as
much as you can before going in with
another bit and you'll be absolutely
fine the way I am I got my fame a lot so
the way I
I turn a dark foundation as you can see
me doing here I'm using a really pale
concealer so I'm just using it being
Maybelline fit me and this is the shade
15 as you can see it's like a way to
light as well but this really just helps
with sort of bright and the under eye
and and it helps to balance out the
color of the foundation as well because
as I said the foundation is too dark so
it's nice to just add a little bit of
light and sort of blend the two together
so the overall effect of the skin it
just looks a little bit lighter and not
a sort of orange dark ridiculous if you
know what I mean so I'm just going back
in with my foundation brush as well
because obviously this has got a little
bit of excess foundation on it and it
just helps to blend the two shades
together really nicely I know it looks a
little bit crazy here but I promised by
the end of the tutorial it looked nice
and seamless and flawless then I'm just
baking my under eye were not really
baking I'm just kind of setting it with
translucent powder and I'm thinking I'm
using our CMA is it off you know yeah
translucent no color powder I'm actually
just lying and then I'm just setting
everything in place with the Rimmel stay
matte I've been really loving the combo
of this foundation in this powder at the
minute because we just I don't know just
work so well together so I did browse
our camera I'm pretty sure I'm going to
do like an updated brewery team soon so
that will be coming soon don't mind my
highlight hair as well like I know
there's a little bit it's not fully
blended but I do fix it later on and I'm
just doing a little lash line so I'm
putting a black eyeliner in my waterline
which as we discussed in the last
tutorial makes me look like I must be a
bit until I've blended out so I'm just
softening it all out with a neutral
Brown I'm just using the same colors
like if you've watched my other
tutorials you know that I just use the
same colors that we used on the upper
part of the eye on the lower part just
so that it all balances out and looks
blended and sort of complete then I'm
just doing it Lowell I subscribe I'm
just using zoom lush by markets my
favorite thing to use on bottom lashes
and then I'm highlighting my inner
corner and my brow bone with nylon
eyeshadow which I feel like I use all
the time but I can't find anything that
I love as much for the inner corner and
the brow bone like it really just pops
and again for a night out when you want
something to really catch the light like
this is just perfect for that I cannot
recommend it enough I don't really use
it anywhere else but it's just so handy
for the inner corner on the brow bone
back onto face I'm using the makeup
forever pro a bronze fusion and just
blending this on my two
bones to create a little bit of
definition and then also on my jawline
and my temple as well just to add a
little bit of warmth to the skin even
though we are incredibly warm after that
foundation anyway and I'm not using tons
I'm just using a really light hand with
this just because I want to create like
a little bit of definition but I don't
want to go overboard and then I'm just
highlighting with the Anastacio and
ultimate glow kit I'm using the two
palos forms and just popping these the
tops of the cheekbones I got this uncle
beauty and I'm pretty sure you can sign
up to have it to be notified when it
comes back in stock because I don't
think it's in stock at the minute but I
do really like it and it's it's really
lovely on the skin and then I'm just
highlighting my cube as well and also
the tip of my nose my chin and then what
I like to do on nights out when I want
something really blind in if I take the
diamond powder by Makeup Forever this is
in number two and it really just adds
like a little bit of sparkle but nothing
too heavy again it just captures the
light I feel like I've said that so many
times but I love stuff that really just
captures when there's a flush on a
camera and then I'm just lining it my
lips would strip down I feel like this
is my go-to like I use it so many times
but I really do love this liner I'm
pretty much line in like I'm over
drawing a tiny bit and then I'm also
going to fill about half of my lips in
with it as well
just because I'm using this liquid
lipstick which is by Anastacio it's in
the shade naked I want to say it or
strict or something like that it will be
down below and but this is just a
beautiful like peach nude and I just
like to blend the two together because
shutdown's a little bit more Brown so I
like to have like half of my lips lined
first but yeah I love this liquid
lipstick especially with this look it's
just perfect for it it's nice and warm
and peachy and it just looks really
lovely and then I'm finishing up with
two of my favorite glossy products so
we've got the NYX butter gloss in a
fortune cookie which is a beautiful
drugstore
affordable lip gloss it's like a pale
pinky nude and then I'm also using the
jus a skinny dip because I love that and
I apply it on the very center of the lip
and just to really add a pop and a bit
of shine so this is the finished look I
really hope you guys enjoyed this
