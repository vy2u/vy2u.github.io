of quiet because all my family is still
asleep it's quite early in the morning
because I'm going to live in today so
cod scallop le today's video is a
tutorial on this makeup right here I
wore this in my previous video that
wasn't it wasn't yesterday's video it
was today's video is my Korean
obsessions and with this lipstick and I
got a lot of requests in the comment
asking to do she's very long there so I
thought I'd recreate it for you because
it's not really like anything I've ever
done on my channel and and she can kind
of tell I'm feeling the whole like no
line of eye but the minute so I'm not
got a wing gun again I'm not going on
yeah you know I mean yeah I'm just
really feeling that it's sort of more
blown out like smokey look without wing
and nice fluffy lashes so I wanted to
recreate it for you I hope you like it
and if you don't like the dark lip then
you could totally do the eyes and just
put a new clip in instead I'm gonna have
to go anyway because I'm actually going
to London today for the stand-ups of
concert with YouTube event which I'm so
excited about so if you don't follow me
well you would have missed it now but if
you don't want me on snapchat or follow
me on x.18 and the snaps it should still
be there on my story if I've snapchat
anything I'm so excited because I'm
seeing Rachel as well so yeah I need to
go because no joke I woke up two hours
early and I had to rush this tutorial
but it's talking about really nicely so
give it a thumbs up if you liked it and
it subscribe if you're not already and
I'll see you in my next video
yeah I hope you like makeup okay so to
start off we're gonna moisturize so I'm
just using a vitamin C moisturizer by
the bodyshop don't mind my voice I've
literally just woke up and just been on
and I hope with so I'm kind of dying and
I'm just popping this all over the skin
just to hydrate my skin I always like to
use a moisturizer before I put anything
else on and then I'm using the Nivea man
aftershave balm just as a primer this
has glycerin in and it just helps
everything to adhere really nicely on
top it's honestly like my favorite thing
to use is like a base for makeup even
though it's not the best for your skin
and I tried to use it less now but I'm
just using the Ultra HD by Make Up For
Ever foundation you guys know this stick
foundation is like my favorite it has
such a beautiful like satin finish it's
really nice for like normal to dry skin
and oily skins to be honest it just
lasts all day really well and I'm just
buffing a sort of thin layer on with the
morphe brush just because I've got fake
tan on my face so I don't
a ton of coverage today because luckily
and Muskaan's looking ok so I just
popped a little bit I'm just the even
everything out for concealer I'm using
the Too Faced um I think this is the
bomb weight Born This Way concealer and
then I'm also using the urban decay one
I like to mix just because I like the
formula at the two of the Too Faced one
but I prefer the color of the urban
decay one so I'm just mixing those two
together and then as you guys know if
you watch my recent video I'm in love
with the Beauty Blender at the minutes
blend out concealer I feel like it just
gives a really nice airbrushed finish so
I'm just blending that under the eyes
and a little bit under sense with the
skin just to even it out and then they
also set it with a powder using the
Beauty Blender as well which I didn't
really show very much in this video but
I say it with the laura mercier and just
do the exact same steps with like the
patting motions then for eyes I'm using
modern the modern renaissance palette
palette by anastasiya starting out with
the to sort of warm orange shades one of
them's burnt orange and I think the
other ones raw Sienna I'm using a Mac
two to four and I'm just putting this in
the crease for like a little bit of
definition to sort of like contour the
crease and give a little bit of yeah
definition and structure I guess and all
of the eyeshadow is gonna be Matt I'm
not using any shimmers so I'm then doing
the exact same steps but just adding in
a little bit of the red and I'm also
gonna put this on the lower lash line if
I'm not doing a winger and a winger and
if I'm not doing a winged liner and I'm
not doing eyes first I'll do this just
so as you can see like I'm mapping out
the shape of the shadow so I like to
extend it like across after my lower
lash line just so that I know what angle
I'm gonna do the shadow at if you like
that's a really good tip especially if
you're gonna do a cat eye so I like to
do my lower lash line before I go in
with the darker shadows on top and then
I'm just doing it the same steps and
just taking and the slightly darker
Brown as well I love this shade
especially on blue-green eyes because
it's got a sort of like purplish
undertone like a plum plum II understand
it looks really really pretty and then
because we've extended that lower lash
line it's really really easy you
literally just place some shadow and
start blending it out it's up to you how
intense you want it I wanted mine quite
smoking quite dark and just because I
wasn't putting anything on the lid so
I'm just blending that with a 2-1 7 by
Mark my voice oh my gosh it is so
so cookie so sorry that it's like sounds
like a man and but yeah that was
literature that I so I put lashes on and
then it did brows I did that off-camera
I've got a borrowed eyebrow tutorial and
like routine so I'll link it down below
if you've not already seen it and then
for bronzer I'm using Mac a blend in the
shade of dark just because it's got a
really nice sort of warm grungy tone and
the foundation had gone a little bit
pink on my skin compared to the fake tan
so I just wanted to warm it up a little
bit so and blending that out with a Mac
135 I absolutely love this brush for
bronzer is beautiful and but yeah I just
help to make everything a little bit
more olive toned I guess and then I'm
using Sun dipped palette by anastasiya
I'm using the shades summer I think this
is it's like the palest one and of
course the Mac cornet for which you guys
again know that I'm loving at the minute
it's such a lovely sort of like Chuo
fiber fun brush just following this on
the tops of the cheekbones and also like
Cupid's bow like center of the face nose
etc and then I'm adding a little bit of
diamond powder by Makeup Forever because
I love this at the minute even though
the glitter is not too much like it's
just the right amount to blind everyone
with the highlight so after that all
we've got left to do is lips as you can
see this tutorial is so easy like
absolute little bit so I'm just using a
burgundy lip liner by Mac and this is
probably the best one for the liquid
lipsticks that I'm gonna use but it's
not quite a start I just like to use one
anyway they're just so that I can like
sort of map out my lips because my lips
aren't particularly even and so yeah I
just wanted to include the whole clip
but I'm just lining my lips and then I'm
going in with honolulu by over I had so
many questions about this liquid
lipstick when I've been wearing it so
that is the shade it's the shade
Honolulu I love the color of it but I'm
not a massive fan of the formula of
these just because they can't get really
drained and quite uncomfortable to wear
throughout the day I do have to top it
off like a good few times but as you can
see the color is so pretty that I just
sort of like makes up for her anyway so
yeah that is the finished look I really
hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial I'm
so sorry about my voice is literally
half 8:00 in the morning and I'm dying
because I've been up with ila but thank
you so much for watching I love you guys
so so much I love ISA the Mina back and
I'll see you my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
