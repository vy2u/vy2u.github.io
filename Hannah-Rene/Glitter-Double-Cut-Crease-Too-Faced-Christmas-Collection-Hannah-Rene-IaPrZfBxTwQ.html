a makeup tutorial on this makeup right
here I love this look so much I've
literally just sat down and created it
now with and some of the Too Faced
Christmas and like Holiday Collection
stuffs alike the palettes and watch not
and I say what not all the time forgive
me it literally just used a mix of the
three pellets at a part of the little
house I can't read what it's called it's
like cafe just something or letters also
the macaroons is how you say my
macaroons yeah Mac reviews also in this
palette as well and I'm obsessed with
them they smell amazing the eyeshadows
of course our reasons who face our
shadows are incredible I will put
everything in links down below in the
description bar if you want anything for
yourself and if you're trying to use
like a lot of other two-faced products
on like the skin and like the lip and
whatnot as well and whatnot shoot me
honestly hope you don't mind that I got
ready in a dressing gown I'm obsessed
with this Jessica at the minute I got it
and when I went to the Halloween and
like Christmas event with NYX last week
and I'm just so in love with it he's got
my initials on which my last name is Pat
field if that computes anyone and I'm
just so obsessed with it so I just
wanted to sit down and have like a
really chilled makeup session you know
anyway I'm just gonna get on with it
because I'm actually just chatting
shipped so if you want to see how i got
this makeup then just keep watching okay
so starting with eyes I'm taking the
Mary macaroons palette and I'm using the
warm brown first which I'm about to
point to there it is I'm pretty sure
this is called tiramisu maybe I don't
actually know what all the names are but
obviously if you've got the palette then
you know which one is which but I'm just
using this to create the upper crease so
you want to do this above your natural
crease so that it can be seen when your
eyes are open so my best way of like
describing how to do this is look at the
natural shape of your actual and natural
crease and just copy the exact same
shape but a little bit above so as you
can see I'm starting at the inner corner
and then using a liner brush just to
flick it outwards towards the end
because I did want to do a liner with
this look as well hence why I'm flicking
out and then you just want to take the
same color on a tapered brush I'm just
using a 2:1 7 by Mark if you want to use
something more precise then by all means
do but for some reason I was just making
my life really hard and so I'm just
using it the same
to blend it out obviously we want this
one this shade to blend the highest up
because we want a gradient of colors but
at the same time we don't want to blend
it too far so honestly just take really
small movements and take your time with
that be patient with it something like a
cut crease you really just need to be
patient with and it will come together
really nicely and then I'm taking the
two darker Browns in the palette and I'm
using a more precise liner brush this is
by Sigma I believe and I'm just doing
the exact same step so we're just
deepening up the sort of shape of it now
it's completely up to you how dark you
take care and well I'm just doing it in
steps and starting with the lighter
Browns and working my way up to the
darker Browns because I feel like you
make your life a lot easier with the
blending when you do that if you just
went in with a really dark brown
straightaway then it would be so hard to
like blend it and upwards
obviously you want the actual cut crease
to be defined and be like a sharp line
but everything above you want it to
still be really soft and blended so I'm
just taking each shade like the dark one
each time and just adding a little bit
at a time and then blending is just so
much easier afterwards then I am using
the gingerbread palette this smells so
good it literally smells of straight-up
gingerbread it's so nice and I'm just
using the bar the brittle alone but the
dark brown on it the black I'm only
taking a tiny bit of the black because
like I said I really didn't want to make
this too dark because I just didn't want
to give myself the difficult job of
blending here afterwards and so I'm just
mixing those two together just to give a
little bit more definition because I do
really want to stand out but I just
don't want to make my life hard so again
I'm just taking at the type of blending
brush I'm taking a little bit of those
two shades on it and I'm just being way
more precise with my blending like as
you can see I'm barely even touching my
skin and you really don't want to go
ahead heavy-handed with this so just
take your time do a tiny bit of product
a time a look like this really just
requires patience and but you'll get
that in the end and then I'm using a
clean blending brush and just like sort
of blending away all of the harsh edges
and then you just want to take a really
small brush or something quite precise
and you just want to start cleaning up
the actual cup crease so it doesn't
really matter if you go kind of messy
with you blending because you can really
just like clean it all up here so if you
feel like you blended it too far down
and you lost the shape of it this is
like the time when you can really sort
of bring the definition back and
turn it into the shape that you want it
to be mine one of mine was blended lower
than the other and it tapered off lower
than the other so I'm just using the
brush and some concealer they can see
that mutant is the Too Faced Born This
Way and just to correct the shape and
just to make sure that that even so
don't worry if you got messy like
honestly you can just clean it up here
and as you can see I'm really taking my
time with this just to make sure that I
don't blend it too far up or blend it
into the eyeshadow because then that
really is quite hard to fix you'd
probably have to restart it and so just
take your time with it again like I said
it's a very tank at the time consuming
it look and and it takes a bit of
patience and then I'm just taking some
of the soft ochre and blending that back
in just to make sure it all sits
together well on the lid then I'm
starting with the wings so I'm using
Maybelline what is this Maybelline gel
studio light the liner and this is
actually dried up so this was giving me
like this was making me work so I'm just
creating a wing like with the line from
the outer corner up to the brow but then
rather than dragging it back to the
lashline you want to start creating the
second crease so this one's a lot easier
you just follow your natural crease of
like you suck it my best advice with
this section if you feel like you're
gonna struggle with it is to if you feel
like you're gonna mess it up then always
go lower than you think it should be
because you're gonna fill all of the lid
space in any way in everything below the
liner so always go a little bit lower
than what you might think and because if
you go too high when you dragging it
back and create in the new crease that's
gonna be a lot harder to fix and if you
go too low because we're just gonna fill
that in eventually anyway and but yeah
it should be fairly easy if you just
follow your natural socket I'm then just
taking some liquid liner this is the
bomb Schwing I love this it's really
black it's really pigmented and it's
very like sort of liquidy and what that
sounded really weird but it's just a
really good liner the Maybelline won't
had completely dried out and it was just
making my life so difficult so I'm just
like filling in the outer part of the
wing with this and then I'm gonna take
some of the black eyeshadow again and
start blending that in to the actual
lids and I just wanted like a really
dark black on the outer part where the
sort of wing shape is and then I want it
to blend obviously like into the goal
that we're going to do in a minute
the black eyeshadow will help do that
because obviously it's powder it's gonna
blend easier and that was a good tip as
well if you struggle in it make sure you
sort of lift your eye and sort of pull
your eye from your brow and that'll help
to get into all of the nooks and
crannies and numbers gonna do the rest
of the lid this is optional but I'm just
taking some of the same eyeshadow and
carving out the crease and you could
just go straight in with the eyeshadow
if you want but it sort of helps me in
my mind to know the shape of it after
that I am taking some of the shadow
insurance because the next eyeshadow is
quite foiled and glittery it is again
from the gingerbread palette and it's
this really beautiful gold like foiled
eyeshadow it's so so pretty and I really
did have to pack it on though quite a
bit though so I'm just using a 240 by
Mac because it's my favorite flat shader
brush to pack on and I shadows with and
I'm just putting it on the inner corner
and as you can see having that boundary
there now of like the sort of outline of
the crease it really helps to make sure
that you know where you put any product
and you're keeping it inside the lines
and creating a really nice shape again
and then we're going in with the
peppermint palette and I'm taking the
two sort of maroon e Brown colors and
mixing these together and putting it on
the center of the lid this didn't really
pick up as much as I wanted it to
afterwards and I think it's because I
put it on with a fluffy brush and not a
flat brush and I kind of wanted it to be
a more defined color in the middle so if
I was to do this again I'd probably put
it on with a flat brush but either way
you need something to match the black
and the gold together so it's up to you
what color you use and once you are
happy with the way it's blended you just
want to remove the excess eyeshadow
there's quite a bit of fallout because
we use quite a few shimmery colors and
and then I'm just gonna finish off the
upper sort of eye situation going on
with some liner so I'm finishing off the
wing and just doing the upper lash line
it's up to you how thick you want to
make this but I just want in mind it
thick enough so cover the lash band and
to help the lashes the false lashes that
I'm about to put on blend with my
natural ones and that is the upper part
of the eye all done to finish off and
make sure everything's as neat as it can
be I'm taking a flat definer brush and
some concealer and just pressing this
against the wing shape I always do this
every single time I do a wing line at
freehand and it just helps to make sure
it really is like a sharp as it can
possibly be so if you struggle with lino
that's a really good tip just take you
can use a makeup wipe as well if you
want but I feel like a flat definer
brush is easier because you've already
got this little flat shape to wear and
so that is how I complete the eyes I put
some lashes on these I love that Lily
lashes in it J makeup and obviously some
mascara as well and then onto primer I
was gonna use the Too Faced one but I
can't find it I don't know it's gone
it's in one of my drawers somewhere so
I'm just using the Nivea one instead I'm
just popping this all over the skin my
hands look so orange so please excuse
that the fates hand on my face had worn
off a lot quicker so they look a bit
crazy but don't mind me the foundation
I'm using Too Faced Born This Way and
Make Up For Ever the Too Faced one is
too dark for me and it's a little bit
too thick for my liking so I like to mix
it with something a bit to thin it
anyway I can't decide how I feel about
this foundation I feel like I need to
try it in my own shade obviously the
shade sand which I have here is too dark
and that's why I mix it anyway and but I
don't know I feel like it's just quite
thick it's definitely not an everyday
foundation in my opinion because it
really is really heavy but I don't know
sometimes it looks really great and then
sometimes I struggle blending it as you
can see I'm using a different brush tool
I usually would I'm rather than like
pushing it into the skin I'm making sure
that I am sort of blend it evenly and
swipe it across the skin because that's
why I felt like it looked best I felt
like when I was pushing it into my skin
when I first used it really caked up
quite quickly so I don't know if any of
you've got this let me know in the
comments how you find it I do really
love it and I love the coverage and I
love the finish but it does make me work
a little bit more than other foundations
that I have so yes that is my opinion on
that and then for concealer I wanted
quite a bright intense highlight because
we've got such a dramatic eye look going
on so I'm using the Born This Way
concealer in the shade light I'm gonna
pop this under the eyes and then because
it is so intense if you're gonna do a
under-eye highlight this intense make
sure you balance it across the rest of
your skin to make it look I should
probably not use the word natural but to
help it look like more of a natural
highlight just helps to balance
everything out and blending this out
with a Beauty Blender as always I've
been really loving it using this at the
minute because I feel like it gives such
a flawless finish so I just done for now
then use that to blend it onto the eyes
I feel like it helps to stop my
concealer creasing as well this
concealer is probably my favorite
because it creases the least on me out
of any concealer that I have so I do
really love it and then because it was
quite bright I'm just going back in with
some of the lighter foundation and just
blending it in with the rest of the skin
just to make sure that everything is
really smooth and a brushed and flawless
and how we want to look you know the
drill and then I'm just setting it with
some Laura Mercier powder all over and I
did do my under eye as well but I don't
think I'd put that on camera just to
make sure that when we go in with other
part of products like bronzer and
highlighter that nothing clings to the
skin and it all blends really flawlessly
and then what am I gonna do next
who knows Oh brows I was like oh my god
what is this clip that I put in so I did
my brows off-camera
I do have a brown shoe so I'll put it
down below if you want to see on to
lower lashes I am using the same colors
so the same sort of warm brown from the
macaroons palette and first off just
sublime not fair this down just so much
the upper double crease lit and the
brush that I'm using is brush by Real
Techniques I love this brush it's so
good for the lower lash line it really
blends things like really well but keeps
the color way you want it and so I'm
just popping a good amount of that on
and making it nice and smoky and then
I'm taking a bit of black and just
putting this on the very outer corner I
wanted to keep the eyes quite open like
I didn't want to take it all the way
right into the inner corner because like
I said I wanted to keep my eyes looking
quite big and open so I'm just for day
putting it on the outer corner just to
tie the whole look together a little bit
and tied the upper dark liner with a
little lash line and then I'm just
finishing it off with some mascara on
the lower lashes probably one of my
favorite bits about the like doing eyes
because I feel like it really balances
his balances everything out especially
if you've got really dramatic falsies on
really does make it a difference and
then fit in a corner highlight I'm using
this sort of champagne E and it's got
like a pink tone to it's really pretty
from the macaroons palette and just
popping that on the inner corner
probably again one of my favorite parts
of an eye look because it really does
tie everything together especially we
got a really dramatic look going on
another bronzer I thought I would use
the bronzer in the Gingerbread palette
this is quite dark so I went a bit
overboard by
on essentially so don't mind me and it's
quite dark and it's quite like I don't
want to say warm but yeah it's kind of
like warm and like terracotta II if that
makes sense it's got like a sort of
reddish undertone I find which I
personally really like and I do think
it's got like a subtle shimmer in it as
well so yeah I'm just winning that on my
cheekbones temples jawline all the
places I usually would and then because
we've got such a dramatic look going on
for the first time in forever I thought
it would make my pin concealer bake my
console slash bronzer and just go for
like a more structured look on the skin
as well for highlighter and he's in the
candlelight one as you can see I'm using
as many two-faced products as I can
because I thought seniors were doing in
all TV's I look I would use face
products as well I forgot how much I
loved this highlighter like it really is
it really can be very intense if you
want it to be and so I just piled it on
as you can see as always and then I'm
using one of these little kits these are
so cute they come in like threes and
this is the more needy one so I'm using
the blush from here as a blusher and
then I'm gonna use the lip gloss later
on but yeah I'm just popping this on the
apples of my cheeks I feel like it's
been a really long time since I use a
blush in a tutorial but I really love
the color of this it's very natural that
just helps it's hi the bronzer and
highlighter together and then Phillips I
am lining them with stripped down by Mac
just so I've got the sort of shape of
them because when I look to the quite
uneven so I always like to go in with a
line of first particularly on one side
like my upper lip is a lot less fuller
than the other and then for the actual
lipstick I decided to go away I think
it's called child star and it's one of
the liquid lipsticks I wanted something
quite new to obviously it much the liner
it did have a bit more of a pinky tone
to it so I had to blend the liner in a
little bit because strip down is quite
Brown toned and quite neutral and the
liquid lipstick was quite pink
so there's blending those together to
make sure that they look seamless and
then I'm finishing off with the same
glass that was in the little care I can
trim the name of it and which one it was
but obviously everything it will be
linked down below and that is pretty
much it I think I'm gonna set my face
with setting spray I'm pretty sure I put
that in the video we're about to find
out
once I finish doing my lipgloss come on
hon get it together
honestly this voiceover it's just been
me like absolutely talking rubbish so
please forgive me it's like so late at
night and I just don't know what I'm
doing but I really hope you enjoyed this
commit massive thumbs up if you did I
love you to the moon and back thank you
for watching I will see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
