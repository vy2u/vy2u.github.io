did I said it I brought it back so
today's video is a makeup tutorial and
chat you get ready with me on this look
right here I realized I've never done
one of these on my channel before like
I've never done a glam Halloween look
and just because I tend to do like
traditional like Halloween scary things
and like stuff like that and like
dress-up characters and things like that
I've never actually done just like a
glum makeup look for those of you who
want to look sexy or not scary okay so
this is what I've come up with and when
I thought of like Halloween blam I
instantly thought of black glitter which
is what I've gone for on the eyes as you
can see there and then I just gave you
two different two different lip options
depending on if you want to be like
super spooky or if you want to be like
me and a little bit more glam and
wearable let me know which your favorite
lip option is in the comments down below
and let me know what you do in for
Halloween because I really want to know
everyone's puns because I do lectures
don't have any like as far as I know I'm
not doing anything so tell me what
you're doing in the comments down below
yeah I really hope you enjoyed the look
that I came up with and if you want to
see how i got this makeup then just keep
watching okay so I'm starting with eyes
today just because we're doing something
super dramatic on the eyes
the palate that I'm gonna be using is
the Kat Von D shade and light palette
the eye palette which I have to say I
kind of have like a love-hate
relationship with this like sometimes it
goes really well and then sometimes it
doesn't and but it's just got like all
the kinds of shades that I want to use
today because I want to use hello camera
I want to use like more warm shades in
the crease but then I want to use blocks
and stuff like that so hopefully this
should do the trick because obviously
I'm not using any shimmers other than
like the glitter that's gonna go on the
lid so we don't need any light shimmery
eyeshadows or anything like that we just
need some matte so I'm gonna try it and
hopefully it works I didn't play me I'm
just gonna take this shade down here as
a transition color this is unlike the
warm section of the palette I've done
like the same things I did in my last
tutorial today well I started with my
brows on I don't know why I'd start
doing that just like so not me but what
can you do gonna use a backstage Beauty
brush instead because my Mac Tootsie
falls are just giving me issues at the
minute like seriously because I'm doing
like a kind
wind outlook today I'm gonna do what I
did in the last video and kind of make
it messy down here just because I'm not
too worried like I'm going to clean it
up we're gonna keep the crease quite
warm just because like we are using like
blacks so the trick with using black
eyeshadow to make it look wearable and
not like you've been punched in the face
is to make sure you keep the crease nice
and long I'm just gonna quickly dip into
the morphe palette that we use the other
day don't feel like you have to use this
literally use like you don't have to use
either of these palettes just use stuff
that's got like a neutral line like warm
Browns and stuff and but I just want
like another color for the crease so I'm
just gonna mix like a couple of these
ones here yeah I'm just doing the same
thing with that so I'm just like
whacking that in the crease just before
we go in with anything darker I'm taking
it all the way in as well because I
think I'm gonna do like a halo eye I
don't really know what I'm gonna do okay
so going back in here I'm just gonna use
this kind of like ready shade here as
you can see I'm stickin to like the
warmest section of the palette and so
I'm just gonna be using this one here
and I'm taking that on a sigma e35 not
being as messy with this one kind of
like can't rip like having more
controlled movements with that you know
I love talking about going to spook who
out this year has anyone actually been
before the reason I've never been it's
because like I just got so shit's guide
I'm like no thank you okay so this is
how we're looking so far I'm gonna dip
into my muck blush palette yeah I feel
like I'm using so many random products
now so I'm sorry but let's just just use
anything that's kind of similar that you
have I'm gonna mix this shade here which
is apple red I believe and then this
shade here which is sketch just like the
tiniest tiniest tiniest bit because I
don't want it to take away too much from
like the Browns and stuff I don't know
what I'm doing I don't know if you've
ever like notice but whenever I sit down
I have no idea what I'm doing
that's all but the crease isn't looking
that warm anymore like it's kind of
looking quite cool and I don't know why
because like we just use warm eyeshadows
is it just me or does it look quite cool
think what I'm gonna start doing is with
a 2:1 7 by Mac I'm just gonna go into
the black that's in the Kat Von D
palette and
I'm just gonna start popping that here I
mean it's kind of gonna be black all
over the ledge but I'm just gonna do it
in stages it's gonna start putting it
all over down here like across the lid
so when you first go in with your brush
you want to make sure that you're
playing most of the product like the
lash is and then kind of blending up the
rest like fading the rest up into the
other colors yeah okay it's gonna start
coming together now I can just tell
every now and then with your blending
brush just use really small movements
for this because you don't want to take
the black up too high we want to make
sure that we keep like the warmth in the
crease so just use with really small
movements and then I'm gonna mix it in
with just like with the darker brown in
the palette which if you want to know
which one it is I'm just using this one
here so I'm using this luck and then
this Brown just to help like fade this
area a little bit more like if in doubt
just keep dragging it this way and like
I promised
just drag it down here and I know it
looks a state but when you clean it up
like that will look really nice because
like in your head when you kind of have
to imagine like the line it's gonna
create and you want this to be like have
a good amount of product there to look
sharp and look like it's like I don't
know like just finished really well if
that makes sense okay so as I always say
when I clean up you want to start at
like a low angle so as I've said in my
last one if you clean up too high you'll
just absolutely ruin it so always start
doing like quite a low angle and then
slowly just kind of take more and more
away but as you can see like I've got
this bit here which goes further than
the lash line but it's gonna join up
really well with the shadow underneath
and it'll just give like a really it'll
basically look like you've done it with
your foundation on first but we're
trying to return our cheap bucks
obviously we
I'm gonna go in with a little bit of
glitter glue by two-faced by all means
leave it like this if you like it being
matte then don't feel like you have to
add glitter but you can kind of see here
what it looks like MA so then uh sure
I'll show you like what it'll look like
with glitter as well and we'll just do
glitter as the finish lot kind of done
like the inner part the lid
going into the like actual lid space and
I'm just gonna take the glitter okay
yeah so that looks pretty cool and the
glitter that I used by the way is 3d
block by Mac I know Nick's just a really
good black glitter as well so don't feel
like you have to use a Mac one I saw
quite a lot of people asking in my last
video when I used matte glitter if like
the next ones would work and yeah like
107 they do work absolutely fine like
you don't have to use Mac ones by any
means okay so that is one I done
obviously I need to put lashes on as
well but I'm going to do that off camera
so I'm not sure just going to do
everything that you saw me do on this
eye on the other eye and then the lashes
that I'm going to use are the Dilara
lashes by little lashes which the ones I
used in my last video because I am
actually really loving those at the
minute I'm gonna do that and then I'll
be back in a minute to do the skin
foundation I'm going to use my Giorgio
Armani power fabric obsessed I can't get
over this stuff like it's my actual
favorite foundation at the minute I just
love it I was actually in Liverpool
yesterday with Mary Emma gum from
Giorgio Armani and I went with mods if
you guys know Matt's he's like hair on
YouTube as well now and who's coming to
the questions party and we basically had
lunch at a place called leaf in
Liverpool and it was actually really
nice like they did it really good vegan
food something that I always appreciate
when I go to a restaurant is when it
says on the menu what's vegan because I
feel like not enough or or if they have
like a separate vegan menu because I
feel like not enough um not enough like
restaurants do that yeah they kind of
just like give you a menu and it has
like vegetarian options and whatever but
it doesn't like tell you what could be
maybe you know what is vegan but I had
like a homo sandwich and it was so good
and then for concealer I'm going to use
the NARS
creamy she's in the same the shade
custard and vanilla oh my god guys I
ordered shape tart shape tape so I was
actually sat here in the last video
saying how I really wanted to try its
heart shape tape because I was like it's
cause he fruit and stuff
um they had 25% off I don't I don't know
if they still do but they had 25% off
the other day so I got two shades and
then I got the new top like I think it's
the toasted palate as well which I am so
excited stylist it's Johnny and I'm cuz
I ordered like a certain amount it was
like free shipping as well I'm just
gonna blend that out with a Beauty
Blender I just like let it set us up I
always say Jackie do this like is it
Jackie
Ayana Chucky I don't know her last name
but um I always see her like letting a
concealer set a minute because then it
gives like more coverage right and then
I want the scanner to be super glowy
today so I'm gonna go in with the iconic
London drops and just pop some of these
on and then blend them up with the
sponge again gonna do it before powder
because last time I did it with powder
on like it just didn't look quite right
so yeah they apply so much better when
you do them first and like not after
powder can you actually honey toilet
roll Jesus Christ this household okay
back on to eyes we're just gonna finish
off the lower lash line so I'm just
gonna use the same shades that I used in
the crease so I'm gonna start with this
shade here and then we've on to the
ready tone and then we're just gonna go
in with a little bit of the darker Brown
and then obviously the black Wow
brush that I'm just using is the same
brush I always used for lower lash line
which is the buck sage beauty i blend a
brush so I'm gonna take this like
relatively far down this fair shade this
is just like the transition color I'm
gonna move on to the red shade just use
that same thing then we're gonna put
black in the waterline so I'm just using
the Rimmel scandaleyes liner and I'm
just taking my flat definer by Sigma
which is an a 15 just into the black
shade I'm just gonna
in lucious just so we will end the block
down a little bit and it's not as harsh
by itself in the war line just really
softly as well like extending my wallet
line just a tiny bit not too low down or
anything then you just want to do some
low lash it missus car so I'm just using
Maybelline Big Shot I don't know why I
keep using this so much recently I do
really like the mascara you like I just
go through phases where I literally just
she's like one specific must go I feel
like everything Paulo so we're gonna
highlight with nylon by Mac so I'm just
popping this from the inner corner here
just to bring some light back into the
look it's always nice to highlight the
inner corner when you've done such like
a heavy I just kind of mix the eyes like
a pear a bit more bright okay so back
onto skin I'm gonna go in with hoola
runs up my benefit just to warm up the
face and give a little bit more
structure and stuff I'm actually really
happy with how these looks come on
consider how I didn't really know what I
was doing I know it's that down I'm
pleasantly surprised so far and then on
to lips I'm gonna do two lip options
depending on whether you want this to be
like super bumpy or if you want it to be
like more kind of nude which is what I
would go for just because I'm a nude
girl but I am gonna show you what the
look will look like with a dark lip so
for that I'm just gonna use one of the
Giorgio Armani lip magnets in the shade
605 and these are actually like little
mini liquid lipsticks kind of they dry
like super matte and stuff like that so
as you can see it's like a really dark
bumpy purple it's actually a lot darker
than it what and what it looks like in
the bottle as well so I'm just gonna
apply this straight on to the lips
okay so this is a lip option number one
as you can see is dark like super dark
and super bumpy so if you wanted to be
like extra Halloween and spooky you
could wear something like this it will
dry down that it's not completely dried
yet but this is what the color looks
like so I'm gonna show you what this
will look like with a nude lip as well
which is what I would personally wear it
with because you guys know I
a good nude excuse my hair as well I
just had to fill in like clips for the
dark one I'm just gonna use my Makeup
Forever aqua XL liner it's not the Aqua
Edsel it's the aqua lip liner sorry in
the shade 1c I've been using this so
much recently just because it applies
really nicely it's nice and smooth it's
quite a waxy formula as well so it looks
really natural
on the lips and then I'm just gonna go
on top with a Maybelline lipstick this
is in the shade 7 110 welp 7/10 of 7 1 0
sultry sand which is quite a pale nude
so I'm just going to apply it just to
the center of the lip and then to finish
off I'm just gonna go in with skinny dip
by G way which I'm not used in so long
and but I love this kind of lip top oh
it makes your lips look really sparkly
so it's gonna go really nicely with the
eyes and stuff in the skin and
everything is gonna look super glowy so
I'm just gonna do that now okay so I'm
not loving this lip as much as I thought
I would I think the lipstick was a
little bit too pale
so I'm actually just gonna dab it off a
bit I'm just gonna go in with a Nastasia
neikei which is a slightly dark nude
that's a bit better okay so this is the
finished kind of like more nude lip look
I personally love this I'm actually
gonna wear it for Rachel's like birthday
celebrations tonight because I'm loving
the eyes and I feel like the lip kind of
just goes really well because it just
gives the eyes all of the attention
really hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial and there's kind of chatty get
ready with me let me know if you would
wear this with this lip or the dark lip
because I would love to know and if
you've got any questions about any of
the products that I use or anything like
that then let me know in the comment
section and I'll make sure that you read
through and answer any questions that
you have but other than that I think
that's pretty much it so thank you so
much for watching I love you guys the
moon about a million times over and I
will see you in Tuesday's testing video
