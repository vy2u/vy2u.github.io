to be a ma misguided Black Friday whole
because a misguided are doing 50% off
today I believe I'm pretty sure I'll
have all the information down below and
all the products that I show in this
whole will be in the description bar as
well in case you want to pick anything
up you sell yes Black Friday is
officially upon us I've also got a cyber
monday haul going live on Monday of
course which won't be misguided it will
be pretty little things so today we are
doing alt misguided I picked up some
really cool bit so I'm really excited to
share them with you I'm just gonna dive
straight in boys and girls okay so the
first thing we've got is a black velvet
top I just love the look of this I
recently got some black velvet joggers
as well so I felt like this will go
perfect with them and it's basically got
a little lace up detail in the middle
and then I think that roses either side
I love this kind of vibe for t-shirts at
the minute or like bastok and it's a
size a I will just say pretty much
everything is a size 8 so I don't like
run through things every single time
also and I don't know the price of
everything because the prices aren't on
the receipt so like I said all the links
will be in the description bar so if you
want to know the prices and what sizes
are available and stuff it will all be
down there yeah I got this just to pair
with those joggers possibly for more
like a casual look or possibly like um I
love the skirt or skinny jeans for like
an evening look I'm even aren't to
another black top you know me this is
really different so I expected it speaks
it's actually suede it says it's suede
in the name so I'd just didn't read it
buy it but this is a suede drape kind of
like blouse top situation so it's got a
little nutted section at the front this
kind of style with like the not the
front is really in at the minute I'm
fits really well and it's really soft
and comfortable because it's like suede
it's yummy it's yummy guys and then I
picked up something from the Carli bybel
misguided collection I have to say I
wasn't as much of a fun this collection
as I was the last collection I remember
when she did the first one and I was
obsessed with every single piece for his
this time that wasn't like as much that
I was drawn to so I picked up this kind
of ribbed turtleneck crop top because I
have a similar thing from boohoo and
it's kind of like a gray blue and I
absolutely love it I live in here and so
I thought I would get a different kind
of color this is obviously like a
burgundy color as you can see fits
really well really comfortable
and it's really good material as well
yeah I just kind of like to power again
with high-waisted jeans like mom jeans a
leather skirt and tights something like
that I just feel like the burgundy color
is a very winter appropriate as well
onto a little leather skirt so this is
kind of like a snakeskin
um texture by situation going on okay so
if anyone watched my fashion overhaul
and you'll know that I was speaking
about the stuff that I got some of the
stuff that I got in that hole from
fashion Nova um didn't have a fashion no
but late wall and we've got the same
situation here so I don't know what the
crack is it must be a different brand so
the brand is love and other things but
it's still got a misguided tag on it
it's just not got the label misguided
I do really like the skirt though it's a
really nice fit the only thing is like
the waist bands a bit weird like it kind
of crumples and like folds over a little
bit when it's on the actual quality is
really nice it's a really nice kind of
faux leather and it's got a gold zip at
the back as well it's flight nights out
and then also to pair with tights for
like a daytime outfit I feel like this
will be really cute okay on to body
suits I have to say I am so impressed
with all the body suits
I picked off so if you've watched my
halls in the past like sometimes that
I've got stuff misguided sometimes the
body suits I'm just like really not fun
off because they're either too short on
the body and they suffocate my vagina oh
they're just a little bit thin and just
not very like well done but I got three
of like this whole section ones and I
have to say I'm really impressed so the
first one is this kind of like nude
Bardot situation I just thought this
would be nice to pair with like nude
wide leg trousers or something just a
little bit more dressy okay this one is
hands-down my favorite I'm obsessed with
this so this is a burgundy bodysuit
again of course and it's got the kind of
like lace-up situation that again is
quite in fashion nowadays so I used to
have a black one like this but it was
too short on the body so I had to get
rid of it and I've been on the hunt for
one ever since they did do this in black
but I kind of just like the burgundy I
feel like again it's kind of just like a
winter color material oh my god guys
it's so thick I'm pretty sure this was
only like 18 pounds or maybe it was more
money I don't know I don't wanna say but
oh my gosh the material is so friggin
thick live really long on the body it's
super stretchy really long on the body
I'm just obsessed like I cannot wait to
wear this I'm a hundred cents taking it
to two
New York and then again absolutely love
this one so this is again a at all buddy
su and it's kind of like a gray ripped
situation going on really thick again
like super thick material all these
might have been the ones that were more
expensive actually because I'm pretty
sure one of them was like 18 pounds and
then the rest were like 27 or so but
yeah I can't wait to wear this one as
well just to go again with like jeans I
don't know joggers wide leg trousers
whatever you want to wear them where the
body suits are just so convenient
misguided no these okay and then on to
something in a bit different so first
off these earrings are from a misguided
so that is what they look like they're
basically a hoop with like a moon inside
and as soon as I saw the moon you know I
have to get them I actually love them
like they move around a lot but I kind
of like that because you can see like
the circle kind of circle in the moon if
you're not I mean and then I also picked
up two other pads of hoops because I'm
obsessed with hoops at the minute I
don't know what it is so these actually
have a sticker on these worth five
pounds and these are like an arrow
design so they've got like an arrow
at the end of the hoop rather than the
hoop like joining background which I
really love I'm excited to wear these
and then again I kind of equally love
these so these were six pounds yes these
were six pounds and again that like gold
hoops but they've kind of got like a
diamond tea effect that I just really
love them I come really into like
earrings and stuff at the minute I've
bought a lot of Christmas earrings
because I feel like for videos I want to
have like a whole vibe going on with
Christmas earrings and stuff but that's
a whole different video guy okay I'm to
a jacket I don't know why I said it like
that okay so this is a gray biker jacket
and I saw this on the website and I was
instantly like yes I need that so it's
kind of like a gray suede it's almost
like a bluey gray which is what I really
like about it cuz I feel like with
charcoal jeans or I don't know black
jeans it'll just look really cool cuz
it's kind of got a lot of black
detailing on it as well as you can see
with the zips and stuff everything is
either gray or black really soft really
comfy the only thing okay so I got this
in an 8 again I believe yeah the only
thing is like the arms in particular are
tight like you know when you go to bend
your arms and your jacket gets really
tight here it's really quite painful and
they're quite tight on the arms and also
this arm like the right arm is
definitely tighter than the left which
is so with it that's another thing I
some
times notice with stuff from misguided
like the arms can be a little bit tight
but I'm just gonna have to work with it
because I feel like I feel like if I
exchange it for the 10 it would be too
big on the shoulders which I just I
don't want but yeah I'm excited to try
this out because I feel like this would
be a really nice color with like red as
well and I've been buying a lot of red
body suits and stuff recently and just
getting more into the color red and I
feel like this will complement it super
well so I'm really excited to wear their
what are the things do we have I've got
three more things from the Carley and
misguided range I have to say I really
wanted the embellished body suit but
they did 50% off not so long ago and if
you like that was the first thing that
just sold the fuck out I got the nude
ribbed leggings because these looked
really pretty on the module and they
looked really high-waisted which is what
drew me in and had to say I tried them
on and they are super high waisted which
I really like because you guys know I
love high waisted I don't like anything
below like the belly button I don't know
what else I just feel like it's more
flattering on my body a really nice
material they are a bit thin that's the
only thing I can't remember how much
these were again just a pair with like
maybe a nude cropped off and a big like
oversized jacket for like a winter
outfit I just live in lagoons I don't
know what it is but they're just so
comfy I'm I just love them I'm always
one for comfort I'm telling you right
now comfort is key and then I picked up
the car key and what he's called car key
sat in cargo pants so again in my
fashion overhaul I bought some of these
from fashion Nova which weren't actually
fresh Nova brand and they were too sure
on the crotch area so I did actually end
up selling I did actually end up selling
them on D part because they just win my
cup of tea they weren't for me and so I
ordered these ones instead the only
thing that's annoyed me it's like
they're quite frayed I don't know if
that's like the kind of vibe that these
pants are they're a bit like frayed and
stuff either way they are really nice
pants and thank God they are a lot more
high-waisted at than the fashion noble
ones that I got so they sit very
comfortably above my belly button well
all-in-all I really like them I like the
pockets on them I like the whole vibe of
them and I know she's got a lot of
different colors of these which is super
cool okay and the last thing from the
collie
collection I got was the burgundy dress
so okay this is gonna be really hot show
first of all can we check out this
material
come on it looks so gorgeous on camera
again I don't know what it is but
burgundy is just an obsession of mine at
the minute I feel like it's really
Christmassy it's just
it reminds me of Christmas I don't know
I really like the dress it's a little
bit large fitted for me I don't know if
that's because the material is just
super thick because I will say like the
quality of the material is really good
like it's very thick so you could
totally wear this with that bra and
stuff like that like you'd have no
issues whatsoever I kind of just wish
there was like more ways to adjust it
because she bought an N but mine could
definitely go like tighter on my waist
and then I tried to like tighten it with
the belt but it just makes the whole
dress look quite puffy and like not
quite right so I don't know if I'm gonna
keep this this might be something that I
sent back just because I don't know if
it's something I'd wear over all the
stuff that I've got in my wardrobe
okay guys oh my god this frigging jacket
I'm living for so this is from the
george and jonah and misguided
collection the collaboration this is the
cropped faux fur jacket so this has just
been restocked because I actually
checked on the website in case this one
wasn't the right size for me it's
basically right so it looks luxe me yeah
oh it looks like an website but it is
actually Navy and you can see in the
light and stuff it is Navy but it's like
super dark it's got a really cool zip
it's got like this ring detail on the
zip you can't really see it but there is
and it's just cropped and really really
soft like I wish you could feel this
this is like the softest jacket I've
ever worn in my I like that it's got a
kind of like coughed bottom I just like
the whole vibe it's really thick it's
expensive but because it's got desk on
it kind of makes or breaks it makes it
like a lot change but obviously and the
quality is insane this is probably one
of my favorite pieces in this haul like
I just can't wait to wear this I
probably wear this with like
high-waisted jeans again and like I say
that for everything and all like jog is
OK I'm too small accessories the first
thing is this little bag so I wanted a
new kind of like shoulder bag for New
York because like I said I fly tomorrow
and I'm so excited so this was actually
recently reasonably price I'm pretty
sure about 25 or 28 pounds and when it
arrived guys this is like weig see first
off I mean it does have like obviously
all the chain detail and then a chain
for the strap but it feels really good
quality
I have really good reviews on the
website as well it's a really nice shape
so it is like kind of sturdy if you know
what I mean I just love I've got a black
shoulder box I feel it you go with every
single outfit and shoulder box it like
so handy because you can just throw like
the right amount of stuff in here and it
won't feel like you're carrying around a
massive heavy bag if you know what I
mean I feel like it just fits everything
you need and like that's it okay and
then this cheekymonkey doesn't have a
Tryon clip but it's pretty much just
like a hat and scarf set so I saw this
on the website and absolutely fell in
love I just so it was super cute and so
it's a black beanie ha I do love a good
beanie hat for winter
I always forget to wear them it's just
black and roped and then it's got a kind
of like fluffy pom-pom on the top and
then it has a matching scarf so this was
15 pounds I remember that one but you
have the scarf it's just matching so
it's just black ribbed again and then it
has a pom-pom on each and I can't wait
to wear this and style this with like
other stuff that I've got in my wardrobe
that I'm taking with me and I just think
it's super cute and it will go with a
lot of outfit so I'm loving that as well
and then last but very not least I don't
have Teran clips of these either because
they're like massive bulky waterfall
coats and but I will take some pictures
in these and put them on Instagram
because these are the first waterfall
coats I've ever owned I don't know why I
haven't got you sooner and but we've got
a grey and a nude that the exact same
but different styles so I'll just get
out I've got the grey one out shall I so
again I just thought these would be so
perfect for winter time I'm just to
power with literally anything like a
casual outfit a dress and heels if I'm
going out because it tell you something
like going out and when it's time but
it's a struggle for girls because
usually in like I don't know a skirt and
a top or whatever and if you like me and
you never have a jacket to go with it's
bloody cold outside so yeah this is the
grey one it's just got like the kind of
how do you describe it it's just like
the flowy
vibe of like a waterfall jacket and it's
a really nice soft material as well it's
a bit thin but I'm not mad because I
want to be able to wear this to like
shopping centres and stuff as well and
it not be too hot if you know I mean you
can always layer up underneath it and
wear like a long sleeve top and things
like that so I'm kind of glad it's like
not super thick it doesn't come with a
belt they do have ones on the website
that are belted if you want that but I
want
more like an open vibe and again I got
those Oh in fact I've got them in a six
C's do you know what I did get them in a
six because I read the reviews online
and a lot of people said they come up
quite like large fitted so something to
bear in mind if you want to pick these
oh yeah that was everything that I got
for this hole so let me know in the
comments what your favorite piece was
and let me know if you pick anything up
wisely discount is on I'm pretty sure
the discount code is cyber fifty I'm
pretty sure this Bishop sent off unless
I've just read it wrong or jaunty I
don't know but yeah I can't wait to wear
this stuff this was definitely one of my
favorite shops that I've done from
misguided cuz I feel like I was really
happy with a lot of the stuff and I hope
you guys enjoyed it as well so I hope
you have an amazing Black Friday or an
amazing Friday in general we have a far
but weekend as well like I said I'm
currently in New York so if you want to
see what I'm getting up to I think I'll
be flogged in I'm pretty sure I'll be
flogged in and so I'll leave my vlog
channel here yeah I think it'll be here
I'm getting used to what's out is it
good now yeah I love you to the moon and
back and I will see you in the next one
