to the video why it says at two seconds
you're just a mysterious voice right now
no one knows that you stopped behind the
camera let's give it all away Charlie so
Silas just sits in the shits and giggles
hey guys it's Han I feel so we're doing
this running down No Wow hey guys it's
Han
so it's Jays video is do you mind making
so much noise they will be comfortable
II still move hey guys it's Han so
today's video is going to be a massive
makeup haul because I feel like it's
been so long I don't even know the last
time I did one it must have been back in
like Feb or March and I've done a hell
of a lot of shopping boys and girls so
also I have dyed my hair back dark I'm
so excited I'm like so good I can just
straighten it and have it like this now
because I felt like when I have blonde
hair I've come really straight in it
like it had speaker it's like look right
so that's just been done and I just
switch to like silver solar now is warm
white in the back which I feel like I
just love it it looks so cozy and I have
switched the lights that I use as well
for like filming so tell me if you can
tell or if you like it or if you don't
like it it's a little bit darker in here
because the way isn't as bright and I
feel like it looks cozy so okay now what
do you think Charles thanks so much I'm
just gonna get straight on it also I've
got hoops in today me and Charlie just
been sat here debating whether the hoops
too big because I never wear hoops or
jewelry for that matter so no bigger
though so there's basically a mix of
stuff from like boots and stuff that I
got online on like Debenhams and things
like that what else is there
I don't know I feel like it's been so
long since actually started shopping
brothers that we're just gonna see
what's in the bag so the first thing
that I have to mention I literally need
to talk about this first because I'm so
excited that I've got my hands on one of
these so this is the Jacqueline Hill and
multi palette this has been out for
Phyllis has been out for a while now I
went the last to jump on the bandwagon
with
and but as a lot of you know this was
available on Murphy's site for quite a
while they've just started I don't know
if it's on beautybay yet but it will be
on beautybay for those of us are in the
pain stuff and I'm the like the shipping
and stuff I'm off it was just so
expensive for like UK ship in I actually
got mine off someone on eBay if you are
gonna get one unlike eBay or something
make sure it's legit and get like
receipts and stuff like that which is
what I've did with mine and I paid like
70 pounds for it which no I'm really
pissed that it's the young beauty
available that's pretty much what it
would have been if I've got it from
morphe anyway so this is what it looks
like on the outside it's just like a
white and plop I genuinely have nots
watched this yet I've looked today I'm
not touched any of that eyeshadows and
I've done anything with it because I
want to save it from a video like I'm
gonna show it you know you've probably
all seen it like a million times
and but I don't want to like swatch any
of them yeah until I film with it so
this is what it looks like on the front
it just says the jack and help highlight
and then it's got morphe at the bottom
and tell a lie I have actually played a
little bit with Rachel so Rach honey I'm
pretty sure she got NPR and when we went
on a benefit trip she hiked with her and
I did have a little swatch oh so this is
what it looks like inside I'm actually
so excited to use this let me know if
you want a video using it and what sort
of collision with use obviously I will
just gravitate towards the warms and but
if you want something else then let me
know because I'm so excited like so
excited to film with this and to create
some looks a bit so that is the first
thing I just love my makeup walking up
colors going
since that hey like I don't know
watching spectate and take a bath
see you later alligator okay so next
thing again actually got this on eBay
but again and made sure that it was
legit and stuff if I bought it have to
say there was one thing recently where I
didn't do that and it was a fake so make
sure if you got stuff on like eBay and
apart then you know it's legit and this
is by Kylie cosmetics this is one of the
ultra glows in the shade of Santorini
again when I was with Rachel on the
benefit trip I'm pretty sure she had
this shade I don't actually know I'm
pretty sure it was this one and i
swatched it and I was just like obsessed
like it looked stunning so these are
like the loose powder highlighters these
were part of her holiday collection and
what she did bring out some more for her
birthday collection I believe I'm not
entirely sure and so this is what it
looks like in the little part and then
we just open it up and again woohoo
a lot of powders come out since I last
open up I swatch it a little bit and I
will do like I'm gonna swatch now a
swatch array so you can kind of see it
there on the back of my hand sorry that
wasn't like the best watch and but you
can see it like in the middle of my hand
right like hits the light it's just like
a really beautiful kind of champagne
gold and she's got a couple of different
like kinds of shades and some of them
are quite pinky and I just don't like
that type of highlight on me so I made
sure to get one that was more on the
cold side and they feel really fine they
look glittery but not in a bad way like
they sort of share out really well and
just look like a really nice glow and
but yeah you can see it that that well
but I will use that in a video as well
I'm not used on my face yet so again
I'll save it to use in a video
okay moving on to stuff that I got a
boots because I did get quite a bit of
bit loose the first thing I just picked
up simple and makeup wipes really by
name and it's probably not even worth
showing but I just wanted to let you
know because it's in science get asked
about skincare and stuff and I do use
makeup wipes I know not everyone agrees
with that but I don't know I'm just a
little good way these are the micellar
ones I find that these these ones and
the exfoliating ones that symbol does
and my favorite ones I don't really use
the normal ones just because I don't
think they do a good enough job and
these like I said and my fellow whites
they just feel a lot more moist I know
some people don't like that word but
they do and they just feel better on the
skin they feel like they hydrate my skin
more they just take the mic off butter
they're not eyes hash in my eyes just
things like that like I really like them
so that is what I've got of those and
then I actually picked up three duo lash
glues I'm really picky about the type of
jewelley I use because I don't like the
jewel that comes in like the big squeezy
- I just think it's so annoying and cuz
it just kind of goes everywhere like the
nozzle it's quite big for like an
eyelash though I think it's really hard
to like get on your lashes and this one
is just one of the strip ones you can
kind of see they're like what the
applicator is like I'm not gonna open it
so I've got one open at the minute and
but this is the dark one they do it in a
dark and a clear version but because I
wear eyeliner and have like a smoky
upper lash line a lot the black one is
just better for me because I just feel
like it looks better and it's easier to
apply and stuff like that it just blends
with my lashes better so I've got loads
of those sorry I really need to burp and
I just try and hold it in and then it
came out so and then I got two products
from Smashbox because it's Smashbox I
really love as a brand but I feel like
in terms of skincare and stuff I've
never really given that products a
proper girl and one thing that I picked
up that I always have really good things
about is the Smashbox photo finish
primer water which just looks like a so
in the box and I feel like those people
use this so you've probably seen it like
a million times and it's literally just
a spray like so it just comes in a clear
bottle and it's just like a prime minute
spray to go on like before
Joran after like whenever you want to
use it while you're doing your makeup as
it hydrates the skin revitalizes
complexion to boost radiance and sort of
gives you the instructions on how to use
it and things like that but it is pretty
self-explanatory so when it's give it a
go I don't know how much this was I've
put the receipt away now so don't
actually have the receipt with me which
is probably not the best thing to do and
but I do remember it being expensive in
my opinion for what it is and I don't
know I think it's like 30 pounds or so I
do not link everything below in case you
won't have a nose cell and then I also
picked up a new product that
brought out this is the Smashbox photo
finish primer Iser and I saw this on
Instagram and I was just really
intrigued by it because I just love the
concept like you guys know that I love
primers that feel like moisturizers and
that's what this is supposed to be it's
supposed to be like a combination of
like a primer and a moisturizer just
because my skin is like normal to dry so
sorry it's important for me to feel like
my skin is being like hydrated and
moisturized at the same time especially
when I'm doing makeup and things like
that
boy I'm really excited to try this I'm
not really hurt or like skin anyone use
it yet so I'm intrigued to know why it
will be like it's just in a little glass
of bottle like so so again and I'll give
it a going videos and like off-camera
and stop and let you know my thoughts
okay and then I actually went a little
bit crazy shopping for news um nude
lipsticks of course so I got a bunch
from Maybelline and then one from
L'Oreal and it was actually so funny
because I picked all these up and then I
got home the same day or night or
whatever and I got a PR parcel from
L'Oreal and one from Maybelline which
actually had all of these in and so I do
have doubles of these now so I'm gonna
save them for a giveaway which I'm gonna
do when I reach for and UK which is not
far away boys and girls and but I
thought I'd show you them anyway I can't
swatch this one where's mine I'll swatch
mine but the first one is just by
L'Oreal this is one of the matte lip
paints in the shade off-white which is
actually what I've gotten today with
like another lip gloss and stuff so if
you want to know what new this is it's
this and really love the color abyss
like I find it hard to find drugstore
nudes that I just love the color of and
like I love on me if that makes sense I
feel like a pale enough as well I
basically have been on Walnut on the
hunt but I've been meaning to pick this
up since I went to Ibiza with Jordan
because when we enjoyment film dad get
ready with Alice's when we fill in those
videos she actually had this and we
swatched it next to myth which is one of
my favorite matte lipsticks and it
looked pretty much the same I was like
oh my gosh finally something that's like
obviously that's my muffin it's more
expensive and now we've got a drugstore
jube so I don't even need to swatch this
because it's literally what is on my lip
so it's kind of just like a pinky peach
nude I would say it's not particularly
brown in my opinion the only thing that
confuses me about these because L'Oreal
did very kind
send over a bunch of these and they're
not ma like it really bothered me
because I put on one of the darker ones
I love the color of it I can't remember
what shade it was but I'll link it down
below with this one as well and it was
kind of like a deep like burgundy Brad
and and I love the color of it but I
just applied it and awaited like 10
minutes and it was glossy like it just
wasn't my asshole I was so confused it's
not a bad thing but it's just a bit like
strange if you know I mean like I still
look at the formula and I love like the
colors that they have the different
shades and stuff just something to know
if you're gonna pick it up it's not
matte and then like I said I got a bunch
of lip like nude lip products from
Maybelline because Maybelline have got
some new liquid lip products as well
which I I've tried like a couple but I'm
not and I've tried like some the
documents and not the nudes so I picked
up two lipsticks tears like I said I do
have these now because they were sent in
PR Thank You Maybelline the lip
packaging and the whole like the basic
descent over like a massive package and
it was like the shape of a lip and it
had like all like the different
lipsticks and like the liquid lipsticks
and the color sensational and things
like that and I honestly nearly passed
out I'm not gonna lie and so I will save
this that one's for a giveaway but I'm
gonna swatch these ones for you now so
these are both color sensational the
first one in is in 7 to 8 honey beige
and then the second one is in 75 a
tantalizing taupe so those are the two
shades that that one on like closest to
my thumb is the taupe one the
tantalizing taupe and then the other one
is the honey beige so honey beige is a
little bit darker they're both quite
brown which is what I really loved and I
could see myself wearing this one a lot
more the taupe one just because I think
it's a really good just like brown lip
like new Jeffie like it go really well
with stripped down by Mac and one thing
that I just love about the color
sensational is well by Maybelline they
feel so hydrating but they've got such
good pigmentation as well like they're
really good a foldable lipstick so those
are those two as I said you might win
some and then I also picked up one of
the matte lipsticks so this is in the
shade nine-30 nude embrace as
I was just on I don't know what it was I
was just picking up different news and I
was like I need them I need them in my
so nude embrace isn't that one there
sorry it's hard to let leave my arms
because this is like off-the-shoulder
and let's be honest they all look really
similar I know they do but a girl can
never have too many news especially
Meek's that all that wah
but those are those three shades that
are just super pretty and perfect for
like everyday lip colors and then this
is one of the vivid hot lacquers in the
shade at 64 unreal again I will save
this well I'll save the new one for a
giveaway but I'll just swatch it next to
the others so that you can see what it
is like can't be great so honestly the
pigmentation of these is unreal so that
is what that looks like that as you can
see is so pretty and glossy and kind of
similar to the rest of the nudes
don't shoot me what can you do but I'm
just gonna show you like on the end try
not to miss my hand like actually like
one swipe like how insane is that
they're actually stunning so as I said
that all by Maybelline I'll link them
all down below and I'm gonna probably
use one I'm gonna probably film a video
with like all of these new products i
chat about so I choose one to wear them
so that you can see what it looks like
on okay and then I picked up one mascara
which I have to say I've never like
actively go out and buy a mascara just
because I wear false lashes so much and
because there's no scars that I love but
like I said I wear false lashes and my
lashes with kind of like stomping stuff
or any way that it's hard for me to find
one that I really love and but this is
the Max Factor 2,000 calorie waterproof
Volume Mascara
honestly bought this because I've seen
Emily like Emily Canham
rave about this for so long and her
lashes always look insane and she always
says it's down to this in scarlet she
absolutely rose about it so I picked it
up because I'm gonna give it a go and
see what it's like myself hopefully it
will make my lashes look good because I
love wearing false lashes but at the
same time the glue can really irritate
my eyes sometimes and sometimes I don't
I say wish I just have mascara on
because it it gets that annoying I just
have to take them off anyway and then it
just looks like a so this one is in
the shade rich black I don't know if
they have like more than one shades and
but this like I said is the waterproof
bomb because I was watching a video on
how she
she's really long and she mentioned that
I think she mentioned that waterproof
mascara just helps them stay curled
Victoria's also said that's me if anyone
watches it in the fro and when we had
our Ramone shoot she was saying that
pretty much the only mascara that really
keeps the lashes curled like throughout
the whole day is waterproof I don't know
if anyone else has found that let me
know if you have but I'm going to take a
Victoria's recommendation and give it a
go so I will again let you know my
thoughts I picked up a Maybelline
lasting drama up to 24 hours gel
eyeliner this is like the gel studio one
I'm pretty sure it's just in the shade
moi black eye this was like my favorite
eyeliner that I really loved and I used
to love it my only issue with it was
that it I don't know if it still does
which is like what again but it used to
transfer like underneath my eyes so I
know a lot of people's iron or
transferring the crease minders that
sometimes but I'd have the issue where
like my wing would transfer down I don't
know if anyone gets that and but I had
to get a different liner I think I got a
Mac one instead I think I got blackjack
which I really liked as well but that
one drying up like really quickly it was
ridiculous
and so I picked this up again because I
did absolutely love using it I loved the
way it applied like it was really easy
to use really smooth and so I'm gonna
give it another go and hopefully I've
started doing a trick with eyeliner
anyway with my wing which makes sure
that it doesn't transfer down I just
literally sounds really weird but I
baked onto like the skin where I usually
transpose done my wing and it seems to
help a lot so I'm gonna give it another
go fingers crossed
I'll still love it and then the last
thing that is drugstore I picked up one
of the Rimmel um gel like the super gel
nail varnishes these are my favorite
nail varnishes ever I think I've tried
OPI I tried Essie I tried like a bunch
of different like more high-end brands
of nail varnishes
a gas like nail polishes this one I just
love because like it works it doesn't
chair it stays on it the coat is always
even and it's basically a two set thing
so you have the colors which are step
one and then you have the topcoat which
it's just normal top coating putting on
any of the colors and but the whole idea
is that it basically the nail sort of
like steps in natural
daylight that you don't need UV light or
anything like that like this notes like
certain way to dry nails it just dries
and slaps and I first use this on my
first ever shoot with Romo which so
feels like so long gone out and I love
that shoot like the people were so bad
that I worked with and by popped up my
toes and stuff and it just like it lasts
especially on fingernails as well if
you're someone like me and have issues
with varnishes chip in this job will
stay I promise you like if you put a
good layer of this on a good like one or
two layers and then a good thick layer
of the top coat you'll have like it will
stay I promise this is in the shade at
zero one to soul session and it's just
like a really pretty pinky nude as you
can see honestly like the price is right
the polish is right it's all just right
it's a good formula I love that I swear
by air and so just picture up a new
color to wear because again I love a
good news what can you do okay and then
the very last bits are from makeup
forever which oh this was just the most
frustrating stuff to buy because I
basically bought basically if anyone
knows me you know that I love the Make
Up For Ever Ultra HD stick it's one of
my favorite foundations of all time I
just swear by it always works always
looks good and I use the same shade all
the time because it's what much is my
tan it's the shade white 3 to 5 it's
more like a yellowy base Debenhams I
don't know what happened but they just
did not stop them for ages it was like
it was just a complete shortage of the
stick foundation like it just there was
no shades in stop and Debenhams is
pretty much the only place in the UK
that actually stocks makeup forever I
think there's like a couple of places
online but Devlin's is like the only
reliable place for me and and I gots the
point where I have run out of my makeup
forever stick now sorry I died it's just
completely changed I don't know why and
I've run out of my stick I've been using
it so far and they've got its tiny bit
left and I just couldn't get hold of it
and then one morning someone tweeted me
saying that they finally got a couple
back in stock so I went on I bought two
shades put them on basket and checked
out because it said there was local
stock and then Hermes honestly
hate Hermes they just me over on a
regular basis it's ridiculous
and they lost my parcel which they lost
a parcel for this haul they also lost a
parcel that was supposed to go in the
club and Hall on Sunday but you know
whatever
so Debenhams had to reef on me I was so
so fuming it was just like I was just so
annoying except wait it's so long and
then it just got lost so basically what
happened is I got to a point where it
was like the week after and I was like I
need a new stick so I ordered one on
Sephora front so obviously there is
Sephora like us that you can shop online
but because makeup forever is a French
brand anyway I decided to pick up the
sticks on the French Sephora got them
shipped over to home to me obviously at
home and then someone tweeted me again
like the day after it wasn't even that
day after actually it was like the same
afternoon that I made that order saying
that the sticks would come back and
start back in stock on Debenhams I was
just like why why is this me cuz
obviously I had to pay more shipping
because it was friends and it took
longer it's about how long you take it's
about five to six days and so I
basically ordered two on Sephora front
and then I ordered one on doubloon so
I've got to stock up of three makeup
products now because I swear to God I
can't go without it I really can
probably also you know you've seen me
use it like 101 times it's just like a
little stick perfect for normal skin dry
skin I don't know about oily skin I know
a couple of you use it who are really
skinned I feel like you just have to say
it quite well or use a mop mattifying
primer and because I do find it to be
quite chewy and luminous and things like
that so it's just something to bear in
mind and but it's a good coverage I like
I just make sure that I play it straight
from the brush I don't swipe it on my
face and then blend it in because it
doesn't give as much coverage and I feel
like he can go patchy like that I
literally take my brush and like
run my brush over the stick so I've got
tons of product on the brush and then
just go in a pot it's just a dream
honestly it just makes your skin look
flawless still looks like a skin it
doesn't feel heavy like that and the
Giorgio Armani is pretty much all I wear
at the MINIX it just looks so good that
is that that was a long run about this
makeup ever stick but you know it
deserves it
okay and then because I was shopping on
Dublin's anyway host stick foundations I
accidentally came across some other
makeup firm products that I wanted to
pick up so they just made their way into
my bag what can you do
so the first thing that I picked up is
the matte black eyeshadow just because I
a lot of the palettes that I use like I
use modern renascence a lot and I use
also use like toothpaste pallets and
pallets do I use I pretty much should
use modern renascence honestly and it
doesn't have a black in it and it sounds
really silly but my palettes are packed
away I don't have them out on my desk
anymore so I don't really want to be
digging out a whole other palette just
to get a black eyeshadow and so I let
you just got a single makeup for
everyone that can put in like pot on the
top of my like the table just to use
when I need it and because I do use like
a lot on my lower lash line and stuff
it's really handy but yeah make up
forever eyeshadows I just insane like
super pigmented really easy to blend I'm
not even gonna swatch it like it's
literally just lack like you all know
what black looks like but there I shadow
czar some of the best that I've used
they are a little bit pricey but you pay
for what you get you pay for the quality
so that's that's that pretty much that
okay and then this is a new product and
it made me so excited because again
anyone who knows me my other two
favorite products by makeup forever are
their probe runs few pro bronze fusion
and that pro-life use it bro bronze
fusion and pro like diffusion so pro
light is the highlighter which is what
I've actually got on today it's in the
shade 2 which is the more gold you want
under shade one is the more pink but
honestly like it's so good it just makes
your skin look whack it's like a powder
but it doesn't feel like a powder it
feels creamy and but buttery it's same
with a bronzer like the bronzer you
can't really tell with the bronzer today
but it's just got a really lovely Sheen
but it's not shimmery or glittery or
like anything on the skin it just makes
your skin look so smooth and like well I
don't know healthy and like well bronzed
so anyway they brought out these little
artist face colors so excited trying to
use your no idea and so these two are
highlighters because they basically have
a bunt there basically refills and then
you
a little palette and you can get either
Republic which is this size which fits
two you can get like just a little one
palette or you can get a palette that
fits three come on my words out and I
was going to do like a bronzer and a
highlighter but I was thinking about it
and it just kind of bugs me when I have
like a bronzer and a highlighter in one
palette I don't know if anyone else gets
that but like if the two shades mixed
together while some using them or it
just gets messy and feel like if you got
two highlighters it doesn't matter if
they've learned over if they get messy
because they're both highlighters but
with like bronzer and blush and
highlighter like I prefer to keep them
separate so this is the palette as you
can see it's got a big mirror and makeup
firmer products always have really good
marason them so that is fab and then it
she's got a magnetic tray so I'm gonna
pop you think oh I think this might be
like my favorite thing of the whole
friggin haul so the first one is one of
its like the palest um sort of like
proper glow highlight they've got a
lighter one which was a matte color
which is like a matte highlighter and
this one is in the shade h 102 so it's
more of a pinky tone I did like Google
swatches one thing to do if you ever
online shopping just Google swatches
like it saves lives
like honestly the people who uploads
watches and stuff thank you so much and
have like good blogs and stuff oh that
is a good magnet girl that is like in
there that I ain't going nowhere
yeah that is H 102 it's more of a pink I
will show you close up in a minute and
then I've got a CH 106 which looked like
more at my Street which is more like a
Goldie bronze I would say and but
honestly pro-lite fusion the highlighter
that I've gotten right now nothing
compares to it I'm telling you nothing
like it's the best highlighter I've ever
used hands down it's what they like next
to each other so we've got H one hour -
sorry H 102 which is the light I want
and then H 1 over 6 which is the more
gold one so that's what they look like
in the pan I'm gonna swatch them oh come
on
 that's so pretty guys ok I don't
know if you can tell the difference you
come maybe a little bit but the one on
the end this side is the darker one and
then there's one in the middle which is
the more pinky
the lighter one and but oh stop it
but yeah honestly you guys no make up
forever holds a really special place in
my heart I just love the brand I love
the people a product so I'm just always
on plane and they are a bit more pricey
but honestly it's like one of the one
brands and makeup that I do not mind
invest my money in cuz I just know
you're gonna get what you pay for so
that is that that's the last product I'm
so excited to use that I'm gonna save it
