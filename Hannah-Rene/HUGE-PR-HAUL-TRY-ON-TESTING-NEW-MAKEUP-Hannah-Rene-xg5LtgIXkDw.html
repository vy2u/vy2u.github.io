you're all well and having a lovely week
as always today we're doing a video that
I've never done before but I just
thought it'd be really fun and really
nice to just sit down and have a play
with like some of the new makeup that's
been sent over so today I'm gonna be
doing a PR hold that is like a Tryon
video so this is the makeup that I have
done with the products that have been
sent over recently I had so much fun
filming this because it was literally
like a whole and a makeup like get ready
with me all in one like it was so much
ones I felt yeah I'm just gonna have a
sit-down with you and I'm baack some
stuff and show you the packages that
I've been sent over recently and then
we're gonna try on as you can see a
couple of the products and create this
makeup look here which I'm really
impressed like honestly I'm obsessed
with so many of the products that have
been sent over recently this eye look
I'm living for so you're gonna see all
of the details in the set I just want to
say a big thank you to all of the brands
that have it send things over recently
and that have me on your PR list like
honestly it means so much to me and I
was saying in the video like it's just
crazy to think about when I first
started doing YouTube and like Instagram
and stuff like I never never in a
million years would have thought that
I'd be sat here filming videos like this
and be on PR lists and stuff like that
so honestly thank you so much you're
gonna start running anyway because I
have tendencies to do that intro so you
want to see how i got this makeup look
and have a play around with some new
makeup with me then it just keep
watching okay so i'm gonna unbox these
first this one is so heavy this is from
cult beauty they have just turned 10 it
was that 10th anniversary so they've
sent over a little goodie box so thank
you so much says dear Hannah thank you
so much for supporting cult beauty so
fantastically over the years
lots of love at cult beauty is tan thank
you so much we've got a cleansing gel it
from a skier this is the Renaissance
cleansing gel so I'll have to give that
a girl later on
oh my gosh is a biscuit inside spot the
food straightaway we've got a fresh at
Beauty Blender which I always need new
ones of these I go through them so
quickly and we've got oh I think this is
Sun actually this is molecule oh one I
feel like I've seen this on cult beats
before and I've been so tempted to buy
it cuz I've heard like really good
things about air and I feel like in the
past I've seen not seen some people
wearing it but I've like smelt this on
someone and asked them what it is and
they've said it's they're so excited to
give that a girl but a browse by
Anastasi I've actually already done my
brows but I have tried
this pencil we thought absolutely loved
it so that's in the shade dark brown
which is my brow shade we've got a hood
of beauty liquid lip in the shade
trendsetter just looks like serger a
product by alpha H this is called liquid
gold with glyco silic acid I'm pretty
sure I used something from this brand
alpha H I think that's how you pronounce
it when I was suffering with like acne
because I think it's supposed to be
really good for that so I'm gonna give
that a go later on and let you know my
thoughts got a dip brow by anastasiya
one of like my Holy Grail brow products
I love their packaging on this is so
pretty have to say I didn't really get
on very well with the old like rose gold
palette by horribie you see I just found
that it didn't blend very well so the
shades are still really similar I feel
like you might have seen there's quite a
few times now because I've definitely
seen quite a few videos of myself using
this but I think they just like redid
the formula and then added some
different shades and things like that
I'm gonna swatch like a couple oh okay
so that was Trust Fund that's the one I
was most drawn to it was like this
copper shade here we've also got a
package from Beauty Bay so I think I
already know what this is because they
did email yeah okay so I already know
what this is I honestly when they send
the email about sending this over I die
okay so you can already tell from the
little paper sheet that's inside this is
the money MUA likes a drug palette with
well it's Luna beauty technically so
yeah this is by Luna beauty which is
money's new brand that is so reflective
like you can literally see my ugly mug
in a reflection ok feels really
expensive and it's actually really big
like I knew it was gonna be big but it's
genuinely huge I think I'm gonna save
this for a different video because I
want to do something really colorful
with like the blues and the yellow I'm
not going to use it today because I want
to do something really colorful and I
already know that I want to do like a
green smokey eggs I've got a green top
on so I'm gonna save that for another
time but thank you so much to beautybay
for sending this because honestly like
I'm shocked
under his name anytime there is food in
a PR package that is the first thing to
go Oh awesome
yeah this is a good time to update yeah
I was eating Pompey's for like quite a
number of months rather than eating 100%
plant-based I've kind of gone to eating
veggie instead so I don't need any meat
like I still don't eat meat but I do
have bits of dairy every now and then
yeah I'm vegetarian but I do at home
cook plant-based meals if you want a
video on what I eat then let me know and
I'll do that okay uncie it's something
that Sigma sent over I don't think I've
ever seen a brand do anything like this
so it's literally a set of like skincare
brushes so there's a gel mask one
there's one for serum like I just think
this is such an interesting concept
because to be honest I don't always like
to use my hands for skincare anyway I
feel like sometimes it just feels more
hygiene it to do it with a brush this is
$55 and you can only get it as a SAP I
think because they don't have individual
like prices on the bark we've not got
any new moisturizers so I'm just gonna
use the one that I usually use which I
actually got from cult Beauty and this
is the sundae Riley CEO anti oxidant
cream so I'm just gonna apply this with
my little brush I feel like this is just
so much more fun to like do it with the
brush it feels like a bit of an
experience you know I got my hair color
today I was only supposed to go in for
roots but I ended up doing like a full
like top pop of color because my hair is
quite faded now so that's why my hair
looks really dark today okay first
impressions I don't know how I feel
about this see the thing is as well
immediately I've like gone in with my
fingers till I actually push that into
this gang so I feel like that's not
actually sunk into my skin properly I
will try this one for ice cream as well
so again it's just like the little small
paddle brush I can feel this dye on my
eye I get those so much honestly like
you know when you get little lumps on
like you have waterline and stuff and on
the top lashline oh so painful okay I'm
not going to ensure on those I'm gonna
try that other ones when I do a skincare
video like the ones that are designed
for masks and stuff because they do look
really good so thank you so much to
Sigma for
those over I probably just need to try
them with other creams and stuff and see
how they work but I did find myself
going in with my hands to sort of blend
them in as well so it's just something
to bear in mind okay
in terms of concealer maybelline very
kindly sent over I don't have the
packaging anymore because it was it was
quite a while ago is what I'm trying to
say so this is the instant anti age
eraser concealer and I think we've just
read on the packaging for this so it
used to have a different packaging
they've sent over three shades I'm gonna
use 0-2 nude because I feel like that
will be the right shade oh wow I don't
know if they've reformulated this or if
they've just brought out new shades and
redone the packaging a bit someone help
me someone tell me I should probably be
giving you this information in terms of
eyes the first palette we've got is from
Urban Decay's really very kindly sent
over their Born to Run palette they also
actually sent over a pair of like custom
adidas
gazelles which honestly when I unbox are
and I saw them they were like the cutest
things ever I'll put a picture in here
they were pink obsessed thank you so
much - Edmond decay that is like the
coolest package ever so I thought would
use this today because I'm actually
going to an event with them tomorrow in
London which I'm so excited about so I
thought we'd give this a go and test it
out so I'm gonna be wearing it tomorrow
as well so also very kindly sent over
her new palette with makeup revolution
or just revolution I keep wanting to
call it makeup revolution but it's just
revolution now I know I'm gonna love
this I love the first one I love the
fact that they took on all the feedback
that everyone gave and kind of like
revamped this palette so all of the
names are actually on the bottom of this
palette now and it's got a mirror as
well which the last one didn't again I
might save this for a dedicated video I
did do a dedicated video on the last one
so let me know if you want to see that
but thank you so much to you itself and
revolution if it's an illness over and
congratulations on your second
collaboration and then we've also got a
bunch of products from Stila so steal a
very kindly sent over a package recently
we've got a bunch of the glitter and
glow liquid eyeshadows and also the
shimmer and glow liquid eyeshadows so I
think the glitter and glows were the
first ones and they kind of like that
product that you can just apply and like
swipe on and they're really easy to use
really vibrant and
they recently brought out the shimmer
and glows which are a similar formula
which is not as glittery as the name
would suggest we've got kitten karma
rose gold retro rose gold retro I'm
gonna quickly swatch Ashley because
Rachel use this on me in a video when we
did our called Beauty videos in December
and I died I was in love with the shade
so that is the shade right there
absolutely stunning I love this color so
much honestly obsessed so I'm gonna save
those for a different video
I might actually use this one so this
one's called twig and this is one of the
shimmering glow so this is the newer
formula I saw Chloe Morello use this in
a video I think it was like an eID
inspired makeup look looked so gorgeous
on her and the minute you say I was like
I want to use it too that is Twix right
there so it's just a very different
formula it's not got any glitter in it
or anything like that still really
smooth and pigmented and that's just
like a really warm fudgy Brown so yeah
thank you so much to steel up for
sending those over they also sent over
some lip products that we'll get into
later and also a highlighter that I'm
going to use later as well I'm gonna go
back in through this palette by urban
decay I'm gonna start with the shade ref
which is just like a really neutral
transition color and I'm gonna pop that
in the crease yeah and literally just
working this in a crease and just
building it up I'm gonna go in with a
slightly more tapered brush and the
shade good as gone which is this shade
right here I also got a lot of products
at the minute from brands like YSL and
deal that I've not got around to using
yet but I really obviously want to test
out and stuff so let me know if you want
me to film like a dedicated like testing
videos for do your and YSL or if you'd
rather I just sort of integrate them I'm
gonna go in with the shade Big Sky which
I'm just obsessed with and this matches
my top so well I feel like so we're
gonna use that on the lid no no brush
use I should probably just use a flush
in fact I might just use my finger
because I've got no nails on and they're
actual stops oh yeah that is exactly
what I'd hoped it'd be and more honestly
having no nails on makes everything a
lot more easier okay oh my gosh I am
obsessed with this color in terms of
lashes I did actually unbox this
package but this was from a backstage
beauty and they very kindly sent over a
bunch of their styles I am an affiliate
with backstage beauty so if you ever
want to buy anything from the site and
you want to save a little bit of money
I'll put my discount code on the screen
here it's just hand extra needs hand
they've got some really gorgeous lashes
at the minute so I'm kind of torn
between it using ladies who lunch and
Melrose up in you I have won those
before and I did really like them I
might go Melrose Avenue because they're
a little bit less dramatic and I feel
like I don't want anything to cover the
shadow up too much so this is the style
Melrose up in here okay so eyes are John
I am obsessed I love them so much we've
not got any new primers so I'm gonna go
in with the Illamasqua Hydra veil love
this stuff when my favorite primers ever
really want to film like a mukbang bang
make up forever very kindly send over
some new well not all new makeup pieces
recently they sent over a palette like a
face palette that I'm gonna use and then
they also sent over a foundation that
has been out for a while now this is the
water blend foundation and I've never
tried it before I've heard really good
things I think it's supposed to be quite
a natural foundation but is waterproof
so when I was lust with Julian from
makeup forever he was explaining that
it's great for brides and for like body
makeup because it doesn't transfer onto
clothes and stuff like that so I am
gonna use this at some point I'm not
gonna use it today because there is
another foundation that I want to test
out but I just want to say a massive
thank you to makeup forever for sending
this over I'm gonna be testing out one
of the other products that they sent
over as well though so we're gonna save
this one for another video this is the
foundation we're gonna be testing today
so this is by a benneferre I've not
opened this yet it's the hello happy
soft blur
foundation oh my god benefited the
cutest people ever honestly like I died
one of the clips is actually broke so
they basically sent this because I have
seen other people's like PR packages of
this as well and it's basically got
little Polaroids hung on like a string
up here so there's one of me Rach Jordan
and Mads at my Christmas party the one
that's falling down is like of me and
husky from Finland which is one of my
favorite pictures ever because the
Huskies actually like giving me a
locator which i think is so cute and
then there's also one of me and cane as
well from Paris so thank you so much I
love their oh okay so they've sent
me the shade one okay maybe you won't be
trying this after all
I'm assuming they've sent this for when
I've not got fait ton on which
unfortunately I do our fate turn on
right now so this is probably going to
be too pale so he might be using the
makeup fro whoo and after all boys and
girls because that is definitely going
to be too light for me which is a shame
but again thank you so much benefit
anyway for sending this over and I'm
definitely gonna pick my hands up pick
my hands up I'm definitely gonna pick
one I hope that's in the right shade and
give it a go let's pray this is the
right shade okay so this is in the shade
why three zero five and makeup forever
I'm guessing they've sent is based on
what stick foundation I use which is why
three to five I kind of knew what to
expect with this foundation I think like
it is called the water blend foundation
like it's meant to be minimal coverage
but we're gonna try and build it up a
bit because you guys know minimal
coverage scares me a bit okay you could
just do like a foundation like this and
then if you wanted extra coverage which
is what I might do now is just go in
with a bit more concealer so gonna go in
with the concealer we use on the eyes
which is the Maybelline Wong because I
don't have another one to share with you
and we're just going to use this to spot
conceal any areas that I'm not feeling
it's my cheeks mostly to be fair though
it does look nice
looks nice would be a good foundation
for school work somewhere where you want
something really light coverage or even
just like a daytime foundation if you
prefer a light coverage I'm just gonna
do under my eyes I think I'm gonna use
the lighter shade in the Maybelline
because that as you can see it's pretty
much the same shade as my foundation so
I'm gonna go in with the shade light
yeah actually no actually now that
foundations been on for a couple of
minutes
I do actually really like it I mean it's
probably help doing a bit of spot
concealing
I think I just always forget that you
can like our coverage with concealer
because I just used full coverage
foundation a lot of the time or just
like medium to fall and like I just
forget that you can kind of customize
coverage with concealer sort of thing
yeah I'm saying so excited cuz men can
go into the Cotswolds necklace leaf and
it's like booked a little air B&amp;amp;B so we
are gonna fill another lookbook so let
me know what kinds of outfits you want
to see if you've not seen the last
lookbook that we did I'll put it on the
screen here I think it was my very first
video of this year actually had so much
fun making it and I was so proud of Kane
like he did such a good job lesson he
really got into it so really excited to
be doing another one with him no I'll
give it I'll give it some credit that
foundation I wasn't sure at first I
never am trust a minimal coverage
foundation I have to say but it looks
pretty damn good another product that
make up forevers very kindly sent over
is a new face palette that they brought
out so this is called glitzy so this is
what it looks like in side I might
actually go in with the lighter shade
first so there's it basically has
highlight sculpt blush so there's two
highlight shades like matte highlight
shades brightening powders we've got one
that's more pink and then one that's
more yellow to sculpting powder is one
that's like a little bit lighter and
then a darker one and then two blushes
like a pinky unlike a more apricot coral
color kind of my words out these down
here are highlights these looks stunning
can we just
oh do you know what makeup forever never
let me down with highlight shades that
all I use like I'm obsessed
other than that L'Oreal one that I love
as well they never let me down feel like
we should use a makeup forever brush for
this it's only fitting so I'm gonna use
the sculpt powder the light of one which
is called sepia own just gonna whoa okay
I'm gonna use a bronzer brush first
actually I'm just using my backstage
beauty brush always use this right like
that if I do say so myself feel like
that looks pretty damn good this brush
actually makes it really easy you know
for contouring no no so I'm gonna use
the gold shade which is called Golden
Sun
these are just like the little smaller
squares at the top here so I'm just
gonna dip into that that is stunning oh
my gosh Lata another product that
stealer very kindly sent over is a
highlighter so this is the heavens hue
highlighter in brilliance which I've
seen Jacqueline Hale rave about Lee so
I'm really excited to give this a go
that is what it looks like in the
package and very soft I'm still quite
blind in but it definitely doesn't have
any glitter or anything like that
so I'm gonna add a bit of this because
why not feel it but these two
highlighters are actually very similar
so I mean it's probably not going to
make tons of difference but I feel like
it has made it pop a little bit more I'm
gonna quickly finish off the under-eye
so I'm gonna get back into the Born to
Run palette I'm gonna use the same
shades underneath the eyes so I'm gonna
start off with the Rif color which was
like the warm transition and this brush
still has a little bit of the darker
shade on anyway so it's tying in really
nicely and then I'm gonna wrap the green
around as well so I'm just gonna dip
into that green color and just go in my
lower lash line with it oh gosh I am
loving this like honestly and then for
lips we've got a couple products by
makeup forever a couple of products by
Stila and then the Hatta beauty
trend-setter okay so we have that one
there bear that in mind we've got two
liquid lipsticks from Make Up For Ever
we've got one in the shade 200 which is
a bright fuck-off pink gonna have to
save that one we've got a bit more of a
neutral eye on the girl and we've also
got the shade 3:02 as well so that's
more neutral
it's very coral I mean its coral and
green a thing that looks like the sort
of color that I would love though also
got a liquid lipstick by Stealer so this
is in the shade Caramella which I'm
pretty sure is just a nude yeah so this
is just kind of like a neutral pinky
nude maybe we'll go for like the coral
shade I feel like that could be quite
fun so I'm just gonna line my lips first
with the box-room lip liner
the shade stealth and then I'm gonna
fill them in this is just gonna help
give me a bit of a base it's not come
out on the lips quite the color
expertise me it's still a really
beautiful color like this for me is such
a similar but I'm just thinking it's
probably a bit too bright for the eyes
so I might switch back to the hall of
beauty one in the shade trendsetter okay
so this is the shade holla beauty the
shade of beauty this is the shade at
trendsetter by hundred beauty definitely
I feel like there's matches with the
eyes a little bit better it's a bit more
neutral but yeah this is pretty much the
finished look so I feel like we've got a
good full face on the go at the minute
that Urban Decay palette I'm obsessed
with like that green shades to die for
like I love this I make up so much I
love lashes by Bucks age Beauty
Foundation I'm pretty impressed with it
I have to say it's gone a little bit
cakey around like my nose and stuff but
I did put two layers on so maybe that
was why pretty impressed though
considering I'm not the sort of person
to wear like a natural more like
coverage foundation I do think my skin
looks pretty good the face palette from
makeup forever absolutely love that
highlighter is to die for and the
sculpting powder I really liked as well
yeah I feel like all in all we've got a
pretty good full face out of this really
excited to try this stuff from coal as
well obviously this was from coal so
thank you so much it was like to try all
the skincare bits from them as well and
I'm excited to try this foundation from
benefit once my fake tan is worn off
because that was definitely a bit too
light for today hey yeah thank you so
much to everyone who sent products over
recently I appreciate it so much and I
thought this would just be a fun way to
kind of show you guys the stuff that has
been sent through recently and let you
know my thoughts on it and things like
that and just demonstrate it and have a
play usually when I got PR packages
through I just sit and like play within
myself so I thought this would be a
little bit fun and a little bit
different yeah a huge thank you to all
of the brands at sensitive over thank
you so much and thank you to you guys
