a Black Friday haul which I am so
excited about because you guys know I
love filming holes as it is especially
cloven holes and but I feel like it's
even better when it's just on sale save
that money this is all on line shopping
I got some bits from misguided and 80s
and then also some stuff from a pretty
little thing I have bought this
throughout the week like Legion ops
Black Friday because I knew that I
wanted to upload the actual video on the
Friday because I know a lot of these
sites are doing discounts and stuff and
on the actual Friday so I wanted to
share my favorite things with you so
that you have an idea of stuff that you
might want to purchase and save money on
yourself I will have every single item a
direct link to it will be in the
description bar below so if you want any
of these pieces for yourself just click
the description bar and there will be
direct links for everything because I've
got to mess up with misguided because
you guys know misguided I like my B's so
oh my gosh this first thing is just
going to be impossible show but I am so
excited about this code some of you
might already have seen it on like
Instagram and snapchat and stuff this is
from misguided peace and love collection
and I got the last one of this no joke
this sold out so quickly on the website
and so I got the last size 10 in this
it's basically a massive long line like
literally to the floor colored thick
oversized black fur coat it's insane it
keeps you so warm like I can't even
explain how much I love this car it's
like nothing I've ever had in my
wardrobe it's like nothing that I've
seen on other websites it's just so
glamorous
I literally just feel like a friggin car
- you know something when I've got this
on its no good this is available on any
sauce so that's where I'm going to link
it to down below and I'm pretty sure
like a sausage in 20% off for Black
Friday so you do get good discount on it
because it's slightly pricey and because
it's in the peace and love range it's
120 pounds but I would like I paid
homage and 20 pounds I'm pretty sure for
this or maybe those who just come from
the misguided website and I would
happily pay that price I get such such a
luxurious coat it's just oh it's just
you I really love it it's definitely a
very glum out there piece so if you're
the sort of person who likes to make a
bit of a statement or you just like
really over
things like I do then if you will love
their so I'll definitely keep you warm
in the winter months as well I've been
pairing this with like going out outfit
so like I had a really lovely
embellished dress and misguided I've
still got it's outside on my little
clothes really I've got a really nice
embellished dress from that and I paired
it with that and then I also pad it with
some like lace leggings and a black um I
think was a long sleeve top and some
little sandals and stuff and it really
just makes an outfit a whole different
experience I can't even explain it so
this next thing is so cute it's so cozy
it's basically a black fleece
dressing-gown and again it's going to be
kind of hard to show they did these in a
bunch of different colors I got the
black one because I don't have any black
robes I have like the great dressing
gown and a white wine and but I just
loved the look of this and I can't even
tell you how soft this is it's like a
dream my favorite thing was on the hood
this little is oh how cute is that
honestly I got this in a sides actually
got this in a large because I love
dressing gowns being like really
oversized on me and it's a cropped
dressing gown so it comes like just
above the knee I believe and then it's
got the little tie as well but like I
said they did this in a bunch of
different colors my friend really got
one in a white color I believe and they
also did a pink and then I also got to
bandaged dresses so the first one is all
black this is just a mini dress and it's
just the typical light bandage material
that misguided has that bandaged
selection in you guys know I friggin
love these justice so much they really
really just like hockey figure in all
the right places I can't even explain
like how good I feel when I'm wearing
one so it's got no sleeves it's just got
a round neck and then there is a mesh
panel in the center here and then it's
just covered with like these um lace
laces and it just goes down into a midi
dress and as you can see like from the
shape it just really does flatter your
figure I absolutely love these so
they're always like a staple in my
wardrobe then I got another bandage
dress this one is white and black I do
have one oh no two other blue one I do
have another white and black one is just
from misguided and I really love like
the style of it so I wanted to get
another one this one has a v-neck and
then it's got a gold zip going all the
way
which can you imagine if you're in a
night out and someone just went whoop
don't anyone ever do that's me please
but the thing that I loved about this is
it's kind of like a casual bandage dress
in my opinion because it's got these two
cute little pockets here and it looks
stunning on the model it really made a
boobs pop so let's fingers crossed that
might have pop into yeah I just love it
again sleeveless kind of like MIDI it's
a little bit shorter and what we shall
try it on and see how it goes and I just
wanted this again for nights out
evenings the powered like along just to
coat yes give it to me give it to me all
day every day this next sort of stuff
they actually very kindly sent over and
because I told them that I was doing a
Black Friday horn that I wanted to speak
to some relative uses so they also sent
over a couple of things and to show you
guys as well this I'm so excited about
because they release a couple more whole
body suits and I was so excited when I
saw this on the new in page because if
you guys watch my horse I always say
that I love misguided body suits but
they're way too short and they don't
have enough in like the tall selection
and this is one of the ones that they
brought out so it's basically a white
v-neck I have a similar one from a sauce
that's black and I wear it all the time
so as soon as I saw this I knew that I
needed it because I knew I'd got loads
of use out of it and it's slightly
ripped like the material of it it feels
quite thin so hopefully it's not like to
see through I'll probably have to wear
like a nude bra with it and but the
material feels so soft
I just love things like this for
layering in the window with like a big
coat or jumper or something like that so
yeah
that one is that and then I also saw
this on the website and this is like
nothing I own and it looks really cool
on the model so I'm hoping it's gonna
look cool on me so this is a bodysuit
that bit already feels a little bit big
but let's hope with it and this is a
jumpsuit sorry it's a strapless jumpsuit
so it's just like a bando and then it's
got this mesh panel here like where your
stomach is and then it just goes down
into a slightly cropped jumpsuit so it's
kind of like a ship running material
it's not Jersey and it's the sort of
thing that I feel like I could wear on a
night owl and we like
long just to go or even to just go to
like some bars and stuff and but yeah it
just looks really cool on the model
because it's like so simple but so do
not get that make sense okay and then
this I am so excited about I saw this on
the new in section and I was like my so
this is a long-sleeved dress and I
basically saw it and won in it straight
away because it really reminded me of
one that Kim K wore not so long ago I'll
put a picture in here if I can find it
and but it's basically like a sort of
nude and black mesh dress so it's got
mesh black sleeves that are slightly
see-through and then the body has this
sort of bunched and like Center all the
way down again it's a midi dress and
then it rises up a little bit at the
front and it's got tassels it's like
it's lace all the way down the center
and it just sort of bunches up and it
just really reminded me of the one that
Kim K wore and absolutely loved it when
I saw it on her as well it looked
amazing on the model on this guy did so
I really wanted it wanted it for myself
just think this is so stunning I don't
know what it is I think it's like the
black mesh at the yeah the black mesh
against the nude and material at the
nude on delay I don't know I just love
it so I'm going to hope that it fits
nice and snug and yeah that is that next
up is a pair of jeans these again are a
pair of vice jeans because if you've
seen my other holes of misguided stuff
you guys know I love machines they're
like skinny high-waisted and they always
fit me really well this pair I saw on
the website and I just thought they were
so different to all the other jeans that
I owned and I really love the style of
them they're basically just black but
they've got a lace-up section on like
the what's this called like the way he
so yeah it's just got a lace top and
then it's got a little bow and then you
just go into normal and skinny black
jeans I'm pretty sure the model paired
this with like a crop top and the way
they styled it and it just looks so cool
I'm so like casual bought a little bit
dressy at the same time I just love the
concept of like the lace here it's a lot
different so that other jeans that I
have and these feel really thick as well
so I feel like they'll keep you really
warm in winter this I am so
obsessive so this is a jumpsuit if you
know me you know I love a good jump sue
this is so pretty
it makes me wanna cry so it's basically
and the upper section where your boobs
down is mash it's like black mash it's a
sort of v-neck like triangle bralette
situation and it's got these red flowers
and fancy roses but I'm pretty sure
they're not roses like these red like
flowers here and I just saw this was so
stunning especially in the winter time
because you know red it's just so
Christmasy it's got adjustable straps at
the back which I love because I hate
when something's just got like set
straps and I can't adjust what it's like
on the chest area because I always want
to make it quite tight and and I just
thought it was so flattering like it
looks stunning on the model really
elegant really classy really sort of
like minimal and but the sort of lacy
flowers gives it a bit of detail at the
same time and then it just goes into
black mm black Chevron II and legs I'm
pretty sure they're like full-length
trouser legs but yeah I just loved it
I'm really hoping it fits me well and
looks really pretty on me as well
because that would be really cool okay
so there's the next piece guys I saw
this on the website and friggin went to
heaven so this is a bodysuit and it's
not like a tall buddy suit but it's
peace and love it's from the peace and
love range again so I'm guessing it's
gonna be like kind of stretchy and fit a
little bit better than maybe some of the
other ones do and yeah it's just a
v-neck bodysuit and it's completely
embellished like the upper part with
these like black and sort of the like
white I was gonna say the silver but now
it's like black and white bday and it's
sort of like an Aztec pattern I don't
know if you can see really well and but
it's just completely and like
embellished all the way down to the
sleeves and then obviously the body suit
partition is to normal it's not like
Jersey it's like really good thick heavy
duty material and then there's just a
zip at the back to help you get it up
this feels so frigging it glam like the
weight of it I don't know if you've ever
fell is the same we like their
embellished dresses all the beading it
just makes it feel so heavy and glum and
luxurious so I'm really excited
try this on and it just looks stunning
on the model as everything it does and I
like the fact that it's a v-neck I don't
know I just love a good v-neck what can
I say okay next up but these are quite
different for me so these are a pair of
black joggers and that basically lace up
all the way like up or down whatever you
want to say on both legs and they've got
like the silver ring it details and then
they're just complete like lace up all
the way down and then they've got the
little um Lisa's coming out at the
bottom
it's a elastic waistband so it's like
slightly adjustable feels like it's
gonna fit well you know I just love
these I saw these on the website and the
way they styled them the model had these
on and a pair of heels like black heels
and I'm pretty sure she had like a biker
jacket on which is probably not how I
would wear them I don't really know how
I'm going to wear them yet but they just
looked so cool that I was like I really
want them and I want them to look cool
on me mmm I don't know how to sell them
yet let me know in the comments how you
think I should and we shall see but they
just feel stroked cozy but really fancy
at the same time okay next up is a
leather skirt this actually looked so
shiny in the viewfinder and it's kind of
like a snakeskin pattern like the way
the fabric is and then it's got a sort
of um stitching detail all the way up
the center here it's like an a-line sale
this is probably one of my favorite
styles of skirt just because it fits me
better because it goes a little bit
skinny on the waist and then it sort of
goes out and over your hips I got this
in a size 10 and I just love to style a
bit it's a little it looked a little bit
longer than some of the other mini
skirts they have which are really nice
because obviously I'm a little bit
taller and and just a style like maybe
like a top like this and a big coat for
wintertime you know the drill
you know me okay we've been on it to a
saw so from a sauce the first thing that
I got was a cropped hoodie and I've got
a cropped jumper from pretty little
thing which I absolutely love I wear it
all the time it's just like a crop side
sort of ripped hem and black jumper and
I love wearing it with stuff like um
leggings are like high-waisted jeans
something that's like
skinny on the legs and then having a
oversized jumper that's cropped on top I
just really love the look of it so I
wanted to get something similar but that
had a hood so this is looks just the
exact same it's like a long-sleeve
hoodie and but it's crops and that is
what it is I just love basics like this
I just feel like they're really easy to
style really comfy and like I said I
love wearing them with leggings and
trainers and stuff so that is that and
then these I'm really excited about
these are actually from the fancy Puma
collection so like Rihanna's collection
with Puma and she brought out a new
collection with a bunch of new clothes
in a bunch new shoes these were actually
out stop when I first went on the
website bought some on either sent them
back or they got a bit more stocking
because my size came back in I was so
excited because they had 20% off as well
so I got discount on them it was just
meant to be I wasn't meant to buy them
at the time and then they just can't
came and then it was matific these are
lace-up leggings and they're just like a
thick jersey material with like a
thicker waistband here and then at the
sizes just lace up all the way down I'm
hoping that these are going to fit and
that they're not going to be too skinny
on the legs and because I do have quite
thick like thighs and calves so fingers
crossed
I got them in size small I might a
medium medium but I decided to get them
anyway because it can always go back and
they were a little bit pricier I think
they're about 90 pounds but I've just
not found anything like I've been on the
hunt for black Lisa plugins for so long
and these are the only ones that I found
that actually look really nice so pray
for me yeah she's brought out so many
lovely things like I wish I was made of
money because she's got so many nice
things in the new collection and but
it's suspensive you know felt like I
feel like that's a link often like says
where she goes that's expensive okay and
I'm really basic but I just got a new
pair while a new song from Calvin Klein
if you have not worn or had a nice pair
problem guys I feel like these changed
my life and I have just a normal like
brief pad it's not a thong and it's just
like my comfiest underwear along with
the browser as well it's so so comfy and
it just feels good you know you can tell
it's Calvin Klein these are the modern
style that's the only
I have I think they've got a slightly
thicker and band here but I just love
the style of them Stormwatch they feel
so comfy I know they are kind of pricey
but in my opinion they are worth the
money and especially with the discount
as well they're definitely worth the
money because Calvin Klein never has
this Garcia these are the modern style
they will be linked down below they do
do they do do them in white and gray as
well but black I mean look at me black
then the last thing is from adidas
obviously also of a sauce and this is
just like a long line and sort of topi
beige top I just love the color of this
to be quite honest obviously like a DD
stuff is really good quality and really
comfy anyway but the color for me is
what just sold this because I feel it
will go so nice with a pair of toe
plugins that I have from a poly and on
the module again it looks stunning I'm a
sucker for anything that looks good on a
model which is basically everything yeah
I just love this I got it in a size
small because it is quite long line as
you can see its got like a yeah it's
just super long and oversized so I got
it in a size small and I just love the
fact that the whole look when everything
is all just like the same color scheme I
just thought it looked really fab so I
bought it and now it's here so yeah the
last sort of stuff is from pretty little
thing and it's really interesting
because I ordered this stuff earlier
this week and but then today when they
what today when I'm filming this which
is Thursday the day before you watching
this I noticed when my friend actually
noticed Millie that they'd put a sale on
but it's sort of like poor all of the
original prices higher so it made the
sale prices look Chloe even though they
were pretty much the same as the normal
process and I don't really know what's
going on there and but I'm hoping that
it's nothing like shady because
obviously I'm a massive fan of pretty
little thing I love that clothing I love
the fact that there are Manchester based
company it makes me really proud to be a
Manchester and so I'm hoping it's like
nothing funny going on there and but
yeah this is jumbo
earlier this week before seeing that on
Twitter so I'm going to show you what I
got in that order thing is I got a lot
of be next door from pretty little thing
because I recently got a bralette and a
choker from Windsor that's like a
rhinestone umbrella and choker I just
really wanted some nice to be next stuff
to go with it to sort of like show it
off a little bit so this is a music
t-shirt dress it just looks like so it's
quite a extreme v-neck hopefully it's
not going to be like too whooping and
but I got this in a size 10 today yeah I
got this in a 10 and it's just a nude
t-shirt dress as you can see it's just
like a simple jazzy material feels
really soft feels decent quality
hopefully it's not like see-through
because that's the only thing I worry
about sometimes like I've had stuff from
pretty little thing before that's like a
light color and it can be sadly
see-through and but yeah super basic I
shall link it down below and then again
like I said I got a couple of v-neck
pieces this is just a simple v-neck
white top again just to put with that
brawler and choker because I just wanted
some cute little simple pieces to sort
of show that off so yeah this is just
literally just a white v-neck top and it
looks like so and then I also got a
little corset felt because I'm seeing
these everywhere at the minute um ever
since the first person I saw wearing
these recently was Kylie Jenner she had
like a white oversized t-shirt dress on
and then a green corset belt in green
boots and I feel like ever since some
tons of websites have just been bringing
them out and loads of people have been
wearing them so this smells really funny
but it's just a black one it's just got
a lace detail and then a lace up on the
center and it's just an elastic waist at
the bottom it put the bottom at the back
sorry it was a one size fits all so I'm
hoping it is the one size fits all and
but yeah I just got this to pair with
t-shirt dresses like oversized t-shirts
and stuff my camera just got out but as
I was saying I'm hoping that I can pull
it off but we shall see then what did I
get next oh so they've got these really
cute and like boxy cropped tops at the
minute as I just said I have a black
crop jumper that I love a pretty little
thing and these are basically just like
the same style but
actual sort of Tisha with shorter
sleeves so I picked one of these up
because I loved the fact that it had
like a bit of a tighter round neck as
well and the sleeves are just really big
and open
I just love stuff for tops it's just
like really big and baggy and open I
don't know I just love the style of it
so they had these in a couple of
different colors but I got a black one
and yeah again just the pair with
leggings
um mom jeans mom jeans or like skinny
jeans anything like that on bottom I
love wearing tops like this with it then
it's super random but they have that
some cute PJs tops on at the minute
obviously for Christmas so this one is
just a gray one and it's got two little
Christmas puddings where your boobies
are I just drop back yeah I love this so
much like I love wearing t-shirts and
like t-shirt dresses too bad I never
wear you will never catch me wearing PJ
bottoms and bad like it just does not
happen
I really hate the feeling of things like
clinging to my legs when I'm in bad I
just rather my legs are like free to
sprawl around yeah I love wearing
t-shirts and t-shirt dresses so I saw
this and I can't resist seeing as it's
the Christmas season and I just thought
it was really cute and the little
Christmas puddings a really cute as well
and it's just a little bit so yeah this
is a black t-shirt dress like a v-neck
one again but it's like a slinky
material and so yeah it's kind of like
you know if you have like a slinky multi
weight jumpsuit it's like the same
material as my old polly jumpsuit
and so it feels a little but a little
bit more sort of like night out ish
because it's not a jersey material I
really love the feel of it but again
yeah it's just a v-neck it's just got
short sleeves and it's just like a loose
t-shirt dress I love things like this
that just don't hook you figure because
I feel like you can put them on and
literally just step up the house and
it's an outfit and it looks really
lovely okay so these are not the color
that expecting them to be asshole um but
let's go with it
so these are part of Jersey trousers I
have a black pair of these again from
pretty little things they do them in a
couple of different colors and I love
them so much I wear them all the time
they're so comfy I feel like I can put
them on with a pair of lace-up sandals
and a crop top and they look fairly
dressy but honestly they're just a
confusing either it feels like you're
going out in PJs but you look relatively
relatively Jon Artz yeah they're just
long wide-leg Jersey cotton trousers
they make you bomb look really good in
my opinion I don't know what it is if
you like because it's like tight at the
weight and they sit on your waist with
the elastic waistband and then they just
go be bomb and he curves really nicely
and so yeah I wanted a pair of like
nudie ones these looked more beige on
the website but obviously quite camel
but we'll make them work I'll be okay to
be fair I feel like that would kind of
go with it so this I saw on the website
and I thought it was so cute I don't
know what I'm gonna wear this with it's
actually really funny because I found a
picture someone hoovering I'm really
sorry freaking hair behind a picture of
Kylie Jenner not so long ago on
Instagram and she had this Fairbrother
on and I'm pretty sure it was from like
the Yeezy season and that Kanye's just
brought other thing is this season for
that one no I don't even know and but it
looks so cute it's just like a fluffy
brawler it with like nude leggings and a
nude bomber jacket or something and I
love the way it looks
yeah I saw this pretty much on the
website straight after out and I was
like it's meant to be so I decided to
get it because I just love the way that
Kylie Jenner styled something like this
so I'm gonna try you know try and then
the last clothing item which I'm really
excited about it's one of the jumpers
it's like another crop jumper as I was
just saying I love but it's in a pinky
nude color instead so you can kind of
see the style of it now it's just like a
cropped around neck jumper with long
cuffed sleeves the actual crop is like a
rough ham and and it just fits really
nicely I just love to use they're so
comfy I love pairing them when leggings
like I said and because I feel like they
just look so comfy on top but then
you've still got your figure pop in what
am i doing oh my god I got this in a
size 10 because after a wash I feel like
it does come up a bit short on the body
so do bear that in mind
and because I usually wear a Calvin
Klein bra underneath it and you can
usually see like a little bit of the
Calvin Klein just peeking through and
but yeah I love that I love the color
this was what I was hoping if these were
gonna be so I could wear them together
but it's not but it's okay it's okay
we'll make it work and then I got two
pairs of heels because
been on the hunt for a nice pair of like
flat for me like really thin platform
heels for quite a while now so these are
the black ones as you can see and
there's just a really thin platform on
the bottom because I cannot wear like
heels that have no platform here it
drives me insane they're so
uncomfortable I don't know how people do
it and I love the fact that they've just
got like I can't really yeah they're
just off a chattin height position my
hand I forgot all my codes to like make
it stand out and yeah it's just got one
strap here and then one strap around the
ankle the heel is a decent size it's not
too big because again no no can't do it
and then as I said I also got a huge
part and the newscat just look like so
the exact same style again it just with
the new strap and the sort of like
denier spot thickish platform at the
same time and then at the strap around
ankle as well again same peel sides I'm
pretty sure this is maybe a 5 inch or 4
and three-quarter inch heel and yeah
again just to put with nude cigarette
trousers new dresses white dresses

nude heels and a pair of black heels are
just such a staple and so those are
those and I love them so that was
