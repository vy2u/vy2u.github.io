and girls today's video is the very
first clothing haul on my channel of
2017 and I am so excited about this
video I gets in it such a long time like
when I see a long time it's been like
what 2 months also also excuse my voice
I've got such a bad like throat and cold
at the minute like I just sound like a
mom stuff that I feel like it's been
about 2 months or so I think if you're
my ask them in November so it's
basically 3 months because it kind of
February now so it's been a while in my
opinion and yet basically been a couple
of months or so since I did the last one
so I thought I would do a little bit
shopping and do another channel because
everyone like all of you to love them
and I definitely will filming them and
uploading them so yeah I recently shot
at misguided a sauce Miss Selfridge as
from so from Upali as well I just like a
mix of stuff I am doing this in the try
on one as always because I know you
always prefer when I try to stuff on and
have to say I have found a couple of
things that I didn't try on because I
literally just found them in the basket
I just like picked up then but yeah
either way every single piece will be
linked down below so if you go to the
description bar which is underneath this
video you can find any piece of clothing
that I mention in this video click the
link it will take you to the website and
then you'll see on the model that anyway
also my hair is just like an absolute
first mass so we're just going to push
her in it so if you enjoyed this video
and you want me to do a more hauls make
sure you get massive thumbs up and let
me know in the comments and yeah and
then slightly misguided rate so I have
to say and you'd actually get a couple
of swimwear pieces from misguided which
I'm not going any holidays books where
I'm the sort of person where I book
holidays like really last-minute like
I'll book to go away like a weekly and I
wanted to pick up like a couple of
swimsuits and like bikinis instead of
just in case like I've got a holiday
anytime soon that's quite soon though
this first one is just plain black it's
basically like a halter neck swimsuit
too it ties up at the top and the reason
I got this is because last year when I
went to Hawaii and with sharika she
actually has the white version of there
she very kindly let me wear the white
one and I absolutely love the fit of it
I love the way fell it looked so
flattering on so when I went on the
website and saw that they had it in
black I was like my so yeah it's pretty
much just a halter neck which I love
because I feel is really flattering on
what your chest and any boobies and then
it's basically got a great sort of cut
out here and it shows like a bubble
and then yet just goes into a normal
swimsuit really comfy you can wear this
one in the water because a couple of
them ecard but this one is trying to let
go and like to see the water the ocean
the swimming pool where do you want to
go I got this in an 8 and it's it's so
lovely it's like nice and tight on the
sort of lower part and then obviously
it's quite um basic and bout on the top
which I absolutely love and this next
one is also a swimsuit this is actually
a bandage material so you can pop it in
water or like wear it in a swimming pool
or in the sea or anything like that sort
of kind of hard to show but I have tried
them all on so it's basically like a
much you cold-eeze it's almost like a
turtleneck that sort of does look at the
back it's got like a gold buckle and
then it just goes into black by material
it's basically got cutouts down the
center and then also down each each side
it's sort of like the standard bandage
material that mascara jobs and you guys
know I love their bandage stuff like it
looks so flattering on basically just
like bridge I mean not really you can
kind of see there it's excellent
material and that it's just got the
clutter out when so and again I got this
in an a it's like attained it big I
would say and like if you are in between
sizes are probably size down and but
either way it's absolutely stunning like
it fits so beautifully on the hips and
the waist and then it just like sucks
you in and then it obviously goes out
into the top part as well but yeah I
love it like I said this one it really
loved me because I was Wonder without a
website and there was one bikini as well
and which I did actually got an orange
go on it states quite clearly in the
description bar but it does not it
cannot be born in water like you cannot
get it wet but there was so many like
negative review saying like oh I bought
this bikini or this swim - and
absolutely loved it but then as soon as
I went in the pool it expanded on a
baseless fun laughing it was so
embarrassing and I can't believe like
just read the descriptions you not mean
so make sure when you're buying
something in Australia that swimwear you
read it and make sure socialist damage
and check that if it can be worn if it
can be like gotten wet because it really
pissed me off that people will leave in
like negative reviews when they're like
really peaceful pieces but it's your
fault that you humor subscription you
know and then I've got a lot of my
choker knitwear clothes because if
anyone knows me you know I love like a
good choke guitar or like a gold choker
in general hard to have any like show
clean it west up and they've got so many
lovely pieces to recently
I just like had to take some oh so this
right here is the best piece it just
sort of like nude baby pink jumper and
it's just a normal length like it's not
too long got anything like that and then
like I said it kind of drops down into a
v-neck and then it's got like the choker
detail here so it's basically like
embedded and like knitted into the jump
lap and then it just got less and raised
up here I got this in a size small and
it just looks like so it's nice like
it's a nice thick material and what the
knit quite big so you don't get one too
hot in it if that makes sense and it
feels so comfortable on I love the
locket as well it's really flattering
and then again I got you sort of choker
jumper and this is just plain white and
it's just like a cotton material so it's
not got select knitwear yeah it's just
like a soft fleecy cotton and then it's
got the sort of top neck now again it
goes into a v-neck and then it just goes
into long sleeves with cost at the
bottom and this does have like a normal
life again it's not simply long or
anything like that it's just like a
t-shirt slash jumper and got this in a
size a and again I love the fit of this
if you want it tight I would size down
and but if you want it sort of like
loose fitted then I would definitely say
like it's true to size and then it next
up is a sort of Nicks and choker dress
so this is a really lovely color I don't
have many things because it's not like
camo like it's not super warm it's like
a sort of topi camel and I just love the
calorics I don't have any things in this
collage yeah this one is actually a
jungle dress so again it's the same
style it's got like the chocolate neck
at the top and it goes into a v-neck and
then it's got long sleeves and it just
goes into work and sweat jumper dress
and I love this sometimes a jumper just
as you misguided I feel like they're not
long enough science class what's
happening I feel like this sometimes to
show off what I will be comfortable in
and buy absolutely based if you like
it's a great length
I got it in a small to medium and and
it's so cozy like it just feels so cozy
on then I also got a sort of like body
con jumper dress just because I saw this
on the model and I loved it and I don't
really like usually gravitate towards
like long because it's quite a long
length and I don't usually have like
wear things like this but I just love
the way it look from the model so again
it's like a chocolate net as you can see
I have an obsession for any trends but I
had and but this is just sort of like a
white cream color like a ribbed and
material so it's nice and fit
it's nice and stretches while which I
really like and again it's a v-neck and
then it just goes down in plus a body
con really long dress and it does have a
split as well one thing I saw on the
reviews on the websites list when I was
loved by it was that someone recommended
to size down in it and I would 100%
agree and I have tried this on and it is
quite large affected like even a six is
a tiny bit too big for what I wanted it
to be and so if you're in between sizes
or even if not I would definitely size
down if you want this especially if you
want it quite tight and quite body con
and otherwise and you could probably get
your own size and get away with it but
it is quite unlike the big city science
I would say but I absolutely love it and
then it's the very last two things I am
so excited about these are actually part
of the new peace and love range and the
piece of my brain John misguided is sort
of like that how your end pieces so they
usually like a little bit more expensive
and a little bit sort of like better
quality or like more design and somewhat
more after is going to if you know I
mean yeah they're usually like
embellished pieces bandaged pieces and
just just it's like a lot more dressy I
would say oh I saw these two things on
the website and I was like my so the
first one is a miniskirt I don't really
have many midi skirts but I saw this one
and I fell in love so this is what it
looks like it's basically I'm a body con
advantage skirt of these pieces
advantage and they've both actually got
the same style in the sense that they
both have to sort of lace up here so
it's basically like a pub skirt like
it's got sort of a bandage material and
then it felt like these gold sort of
lace-up details here and one if you can
see if you haven't seen that but yeah it
just goes into a miniskirt so it's it's
like just a bikini and then at the back
there's just a gold zip and I love the
fit of this I got it in an a but in
general the Bunge stuff is so flattering
on because it really sucks you in and
just like makes you stick out and let
your hip and you waste all this looks so
beautiful and then the second piece is
actually the same style and you can see
so again it's bandaged and it's called
like the source tab material and also
the lace top down the center and the
goal is it at the back but it's actually
a mini draft so this is sort of like the
top part and it got like a scoop
neckline and then it's just got to sort
of skinny like simple straps and then at
the back
right goes into a zip and then it goes
down it's like a mini dress this is like
quite sure I would say it's not too
short for me yeah I absolutely love
these they feel so comfortable on like I
said they look very flattering punish
yourself for misguided is so thick like
so well made and I just think what
something like a night out or like a
really special like your birthday or
something like that I feel like these
will be so stunning with a pair of black
heels and like really smoking makeup you
know so that was everything that fly
madness guided I'm going to do Miss
Selfridge and they don't really shot a
lot in myself is anymore to second I
never really like shot install I feel
here which used to shop at myself as
when I might go to shops and also like I
still go but I just don't go very often
and I saw these two things the first one
I saw my friend Millie because she
actually works there and then second one
I saw in line yeah I saw this on Millie
because she was basically getting ready
for a day and I was like sat in a bath
just like helping and trying to my
washing and ready and whatnot and it's
basically just a cotton for Jersey
Bardot jeongsu and I have been on the
horn who one of these so long I wanted a
long sleeved Bardot black bodysuit for
ages and for some reason I just couldn't
find one that is literally what is its
got like a tab so it sort of rolled over
and but yet to sit off your shoulders
it's got long sleeves
it's like a nice thick cotton material
like a jersey material and also it's
long it does not suffocate to the JJ
boys and girls because that's one thing
I start to know when she was trying on
because she's so small like Millie if
you watch in there she was a shorter and
a half yeah it just it just feels so
comfortable on and displease as well and
quite like quite tight in the sense that
they make your arms look nice and slim I
just love the fit of it and it really is
quite long like it's not too sure I mean
whatsoever which I love so that I got in
a size 8 and it was 18 pounds I think I
quite into other colors as well but I'll
link
what can find down below and also saw
this and then she loved the way you
looked on the model it's basically like
a really long and cocky shirt draft so
yeah it's like she just got like the
buttons all the way down and then it's
got a sort of wet hand there which I
love because I feel like when you walk
in you can't really see it when you saw
snow but like when you walk in you can
really see it and I feel like it
it has a really nice fat and then it
just got a sort of roll up cost sleeve
here that sort of like three-quarter
length and then it's just got the collar
and it's got like a pocket either side
I've got this in a pen because your
essence I do like and see it a little
bit looser because I feel like they look
more flattering when they just don't
hook anything on your figure so I like
them to just drop if you're not only
with 59 pounds although I'm pretty sure
they will sail on when I got this job or
something like that
every actual is a really beautiful khaki
color and again I feel like pieces like
this are so nice this time of year
because you could layer this with like a
really big like to come picot and like
some little boots and or you could just
wear it with a pair of boots and say
like a gla or like just other edge and
the feel like things like this really
versatile and I loved the look of it and
they always love sort of pieces
from misguided misguided mr. Alfred I
feel like they do them really well and
then it next up is a sauce itself
exactly the store where I just found a
whole bunch of stuff that I'm not tried
on I'll start with the one piece I did
try on so this is from the fancy Puma
range and anyone who knows me knows I
actually just had an obsession with that
very Chisholm in it was like a
collaboration with Rihanna oh my god my
throat but yeah I was looking like I
loved the style of it I love the fit of
all the things that happen there they're
so comfy and so well made and so this
actually went into sale and it was the
last small and I was like it's meant to
be though it's basically a cropped black
jumper and it quite sick and it's got a
roll next year which is like Reznik got
a little bit which I love and then on
the sleeve it's got Puma and it sort of
like a velvet sort of like embossed
honestly web so and then it just goes
down into golf leaves and other said its
crop like so I just love it it feels so
comfy on I have to lace up jumpers from
the 20p Marines which are like the ones
that are I have a black one and a white
one and they just saw place up in the
garage they're just so comfy I live in
like they just feel so luxurious and
closed up worth the money I got this
miss small and laser to things from the
medium and I feel like you can get away
with either size because it's sort of
designed to be a little bit oversized
anyway I just will be at the quality
event the style of it I feel like I'm
just collecting pieces but I also just
got a new difficulty from there
and I'm just obsessed I love it like a
comic minister or not if there's still
some pieces left I will link our link
this down below if it's still in stock
but if not I just gone home look anyway
because it's all on sale and I just love
all of it okay and then this next thing
so this is interests that I've not tried
on but it's all pretty like easy to show
and so this first thing is from 16 which
is actually it's a unisex brand but a
soft only stock the men's stuff in it so
I've pretty much a shot from the men's
range because you know you're a but it's
basically a baby pink just left and it
just looks like so it's just like I said
at baby pink color and it's got 6 June
at Paris written on the front I
originally found this brand when I was
in Paris I was actually done with Dell
last September and delicious and I found
this range while she was last we were
shopping at one day and I fell in love
with it and then when I came home to
search it online my they only found the
menswear on a sauce but I feel like the
menswear I mean this is like a men's
item but like this could passes like
unisex in my opinion basically just go
down into a sweater and then it's got
the six students they all have like this
little black logo here and it's
literally just yeah like a nude baby
pink jumper and it's fleece inside which
I love again mister from that it's like
not as pricey and stuff at the Puma
range and but it's not like particularly
cheap but I feel like you get it so with
the money like everything just feels so
good because I do have a couple of
things from here again and I love the
brand next thing I got was a hat from
Calvin Klein and I've been one in a
Calvin Klein heart ever since i watch
and Madeline Bailey's cover of shape of
you if you don't follow madeleine Bailey
on youtube be sure she's got such an
incredible voice and she recently did a
cover of shades view by Ed Sheeran and
she had like a nude Calvin Klein harm
and loved the style of it and the fit of
it I will tell you why basically I have
this issue with cups where I feel like
some of them come too far down on the
sides to the point where you meet your
ears to go someone tell me that you like
know what I'm talking about where you
have this problem where like a cap is
too fitted if I'm too fitted on this
front bit yeah because it's got like um
a panel inserted that sort of like fits
the shape of it and then it just makes
the rest of it look odd I just I'm not a
fan of that
so this one has no sort of insert on
like this for next year so it's
completely separate and it's quite how
cool as you can see like where the sides
are so it doesn't come too far down on
the end either like I hate cops that
like they make the air show here but
this one doesn't do not mean like it's
made it just makes my head I just knew
it was when I start on my the little but
I need it so yeah this is what it's like
so as you can see it's got no it's all
just fabric all the way around and then
it does have at the bar um like just an
easy sort of adjustment and it was
expensive I want to say I was a black
chrome because I knew that I forgotten
each one is get makeup all over it and I
do wear black more anyway it says it was
30 pounds but I don't remember paying
that much for it by the way I got any
I'll link it down below
I love initialize a little CK on the
front then I got two body suits because
the tall body suit range from estas is
my favorite whole body suit range to any
Brando's because they genuinely are
talking so this one is basically like a
cutout sleeve so it's a high neck as you
can see its got like a roll neck here
and then it's got a little button at the
back and then it's got a cutout shoulder
which is like this like this area here
just people don't a lot for controllers
are hang out come on and then it just
goes into a sleeve and yet into a body
suit like I said this whole range from a
sauce it's just like the back you know
the very last one is similar to like the
misguided at me why might be a misguided
Miss Selfridge it's similar to the Miss
Selfridge when I get in the pencil it's
Bardot but it like crosses over this
one's kind of hard to show but you'll be
able to see it on the model like if you
go to the website but it basically sits
on your shoulders and then it's got a
tablet goes there on the topic goes here
and again it just goes into a body suit
this one is a soft grunge and I got it
in a sad 8 I think yeah I got it in an
a.m. and it just sort of six like it's
kind of hard to show but you can sort of
see there are two tabs and then it's
just got like the actual body bit so
they just go across your shoulders and
they just cut got done and then it last
lot of stuff is from Oh poly so very
quickly I just got two more little scoop
tops because their jerseys drop
absolutely adore and so I just got one
of the Jersey like scoop tops into doing
what
tope on the market color mock Mahakala i
got this in an a and I love these
because I can wear them without bra and
I feel comfortable in them like they're
not see-through the double layered like
all the juicy stuff is double layered so
even though sometimes you can see a
little bit of NIC it's like not obvious
and like you can't see through it you
know so that's so complete to wear and
then I also just got the same one in
white and I tried this on before and I
got makeup all over it
story of my life nice one hunter and
then I got to a body suits which I've
been meaning to get the ages and season
just like the really deep v-neck cut
body suits which they powered like the
embellish skirt and so what does black
and I'm one of them's like a taupe color
again I've got both colors because why
not
I got these in an 8 as well they are
very like very local and it's a very
deep V but I liked them because they
basically got like um what you call this
there's got like oh what's the word for
this now basically they've got a line in
here which is kind of it sticks to your
skin and so it doesn't like your boobs
don't want to pop out too much of you
not I mean because this layer basically
runs down each side of the V on the
inside of the fabric and it stops it
like moving around it kind of just 60
skin and which i think is like really
well done yeah they are very local as I
said just let my mind if you want to get
some but I feel like I'm a c-cup and a
few like my boobs to look okay in there
but they don't make some non-existent if
you don't mean and but yes that's just
something to bear in mind it's very
dramatic dramatically cut in Bellini and
if not on the right and wrong I'm going
to stop because it sounds wrong and the
last thing I got is a dress which is
impossible to show but you'll see it
here so I'm just not even going to try I
got this again because Millie husband
and she when she wears this dress
it looks insane on her so I was like
okay she has the soft hope you want to
let the same color as this bloody suit
and but I got the black horn because
they always tend to my blacks have
darker hair and it really just didn't do
a lot for my body I don't think like 1
mili whether she looks insane and what
it made my boobs look non-existent like
that was my issue it looks great unlike
the lower portion around like the hips
in the bomb and but it just really made
much hassle so so so so so far which
obviously isn't
dang like please don't anyone start
putting words in my mouth but it just
didn't look flattering on me I got and I
got it in a I felt very comfortable it's
difficult I like Jesus Christ honestly
like amazed to get this thing on because
there's like a million in one strap
everything yeah that was my only issue
that I'm probably gonna send this back
just because it doesn't it doesn't look
right on my body because I feel like I
have quite wide hair then it just does a
lot wrong this woman it looks wrong if
something makes me look quite flat
chested if you know what I mean but yeah
I do love it and a little bit on mail
and I feel like on the right body this
would look insane but for somebody they
just they just didn't do anything for me
that was the only thing and it looks
nice but I much prefer like my multi way
place at jumpsuits from old poly and
stuff like that so I'm probably gonna
send this back so if you like a long get
a lot of use out of it and but if you
quite busty and you're like clipping the
food's out this is beautiful so that was
everything that I've got these past
couple of days well past couple of weeks
have been waiting to film it all for so
long I'm gonna go because my throat is
on fire I had to stop like so many times
because I just a coffin tips while
someone is video but I really hope you
all enjoyed it anyway commit massive
thumbs up as you do it and let me know
which your favorite piece is in the
comments down below because I would love
to know but yeah thank you so so much
for watching I love you guys balloon and
back and I will see you in my next video
