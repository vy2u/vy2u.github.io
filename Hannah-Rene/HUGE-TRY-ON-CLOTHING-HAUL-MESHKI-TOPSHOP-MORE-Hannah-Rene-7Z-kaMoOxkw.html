going to be a huge mukil save clothing
haul I'm gonna be doing I saw it first
and a brand called mesh key I think
that's how you saying it which I've
never actually featured on my channel
before this is the first time I've ever
shot from though I was supposed to have
some stuff from misguided as well but
misguided and Henry's delivery just
completely played me literally just
never send open it got lost it's all my
homies parcels get lost
so that is tough huh what we fought I
get into the video I just want to have a
quick chat with you about an app that I
want to introduce you all to I feel like
some of you guys know about this app
because some of you have been trying to
me about it on Twitter and things if you
like whenever I do hauls you guys always
love to have a look at the links and
stuff and actually shut the stuff online
yourself so this app is gonna help you
out so much with that so it's actually
called it 21 buttons I've only recently
found it and started using it and
honestly I'm wondering why is this not
been in my life sooner so this is what
the app looks like this is basically my
profile page there so that is me at the
top and then you've pretty much got my
feet there so at the minute I've only
got four photos on it which are photos
from Instagram because to be honest like
sorry the Lighting's gonna go really
warm now whenever I upload like clothing
photos and stuff on Instagram obviously
I can't have the brands but I can never
actually properly linked to the like
link of the item and I do get to Yun's
and stuff sometimes asking like the
direct link so this you can literally
click on a picture and then it's
basically got a bunch of different
buttons on so as you can see this
outfits got to and when you click one of
the buttons or like any of the buttons
it will basically pop up is that showing
yeah you can see it better that it
basically pops up with the lane so that
is the link to the dress that I'm
wearing I've also linked the choker in
that picture as well and but as you can
see there's a little tab at the bottom
where if you click it it will take you
directly to the link on the website
which as you can see that is from
sisters the label it's just such a honey
up especially if you got a lot of
inspiration to like clothing and things
from like social media and photos and
stuff like that because you can
literally shop directly from the I and
I've also got a photo of me and Jordan
from the stuff we had from I saw it
first
and then I've got the dress that I wore
to the Baptist and then my most recent
Instagram which I did actually get quite
a lot of questions specifically about
the top and the jeans and stuff which is
that one there so the app is available
on iOS and Android and I'm gonna leave a
link down below and also link my profile
so that if you are interested in having
a sharp with the stuff that I wear and
things like that then it'll be a lot
easier than trying to find it from what
I link on Instagram and stuff like that
I'm gonna be put in a lot of photos of
the clothes of what I'm gonna show in
this hall as well so if you're
interested in anything that I'm going to
be showing and you can which'll just
shop it straight from 21 buttons because
the pictures will be on that anyway I'm
just gonna get straight in I'm gonna
start with mesh key I don't actually
know if I'm saying that right but it's
about M e sh k I so I'm assuming it's
mesh key so I can't remember how I found
this brand but it's basically an online
like sort of boutique from what I gather
they are based in Australia so it's like
an Australian boutique but don't be put
off if you are UK base because obviously
I am and first of all the shipping is
really reasonable I'm pretty sure it's
like free shipping over a hundred or 200
pounds I can't quite remember but they
do have a free shipping option if you
spend somewhat and if not then you pay I
think it's about ten pounds which isn't
crazy because it's express shipping so
it literally arrives I've made two
deliveries here and they arrived within
two days which is so quick considering
it's from Australia so I just want to
put that all that there was no like
custom charges or anything like that as
well so it's literally just like
shopping a brand from the UK so be
honest like I didn't really experience
any issue with the fit that
Australian price-wise I can't remember
how much everything this is so I'll try
and link stuff down below or like I said
it will be on the 21 buttons at
throughout the week and but it's kind of
it's like reasonable it's not sort of
like misguided as like affordable as
misguided I would say it's more like
Topshop prices and stuff like that but I
have tried every single piece on as well
so I did all the Tryon Clips first
because I wanted to be able to talk
about the actual products and like what
I think of them and the fit and stuff
like that and have to say boys and girls
this is the first haul I've done it in
so long where I actually liked
everything everything is fair I've liked
it all this maybe like one thing that
wasn't quite right but pretty much
everything is perfect so I'm like
so this is oh I love the color of this
now that I've got dark hair gun I just
feel like this is such a pretty color
and but I feel like it's kind of like a
burgundy reddish maroon color it's like
a deep red and I feel like dark hair and
like blonde hair just suit this color so
well so it's a satin it dress as you can
see please don't mind the fact that it's
creased a lot of this stuff isn't pretty
crease and but it's basically just a
satin kind of strapless dress first
thing I want to say is like the fit
across the boobies is so good it's got
like a bunch of putty and it's got just
the right amount padding like I didn't
even realize when I put it on but it was
padded until I looked in the mirror and
I was like oh my god my boss looks
really good it's just a round car and it
honestly it just looks so flattering
like I usually struggle with stuff that
strapless I had to have to wear like a
strapless bra or something like that
because I feel like I just I feel like
it just doesn't look flattering on my
body and but there was something about
this ships it just looks so good and
then it goes down into kind of like a
mini dress and then I don't know if you
can tell but it has about a split like
up one side of the leg and I will say
it's a very long split like I'm not
entirely sure what and what I'm gonna
wear with it yet but you need to wear
something pretty either high-waisted or
I don't know it's Rihanna she could like
pin the split as well like I did try and
hold it together and see what that would
look like and you could do that and I
actually don't mind the fact that the
splits quite high like because I still
feels safe in it if that makes sense
like I don't feel like it's too
revealing or anything like that and they
just fit really well like it fit
perfectly it just looked really
flattering on I look the material feels
really good quality look the color I
just loved it I put it on and I was like
yes please okay next is I'll do this
next so this is a place you this wasn't
quite like what I expected it to be it
was kind of I think it's the material
like the materials kind of um I don't I
can never describe materials I don't
know what the core but it's kind of like
crappy that would I don't know I don't
know if you know what I mean but it's
kind of like rough if that makes sense
like textured but it is a lovely place
ooh and the thing that I really love
about this as well is that when I tried
it
I kind of found like two different ways
to style it so it's basically just it's
got like a color as you can see and it's
got like three-quarter length sleeves
you can roll them down but I've referred
them up a little bit and then it just
goes down it's really hard to see
because it's black and but it just goes
down into a sort of quite low v-neck
kind of like a shirt with like a collar
and a low v-neck and then it's got a
waistband that you can tighten adjust
and then it's got shorts where that two
pockets like one pocket on each Shore so
when I first try it on I just walk
normally and tried it with like the
collar around the neck and stuff and
with like the v-neck and I do like it
but it feels a little bit big in that
area on me I don't know what it is
probably just because I'm not got enough
to fill it I don't really know but it
did feel a little bit big in that area
and nothing crazy like it wasn't an
issue um but I probably have to like
wear I don't know wear a bra or just put
like a bit of tape or something like
that and then the other way I styled it
is that basically because it was quite
large I kind of like pulled it off the
shoulder and it just looked so cute the
only thing about that style though was
the fact that because I was pulling it
off the shoulder it rose up quite a lot
and the crotch like really rised up and
I was just like dying but I do really
like it it looks really nice either way
so I'm gonna show you both ways that I
styled it in each round clips okay next
thing this is actually the first thing I
ordered so I did make two orders and I
originally only bought this like
two-piece like sat and then I just kept
shopping and eating more and that's how
we ended up yes so these are this is
like a tracksuit sat so I honestly you
guys know I love wearing track series
I've got tracksuit bottoms on right now
I find them so comfy they're so easy
just the way around the house that easy
for just like popping out and stuff like
that like I'll just wear track suits all
day honestly I just must sell compete
with like sliders and stuff so they have
this in a bunch of different colors but
I got black because you guys know I love
wearing black and seeing his dogs dyeing
my hair doc good I felt like the old
dark vibe you know they're kind of like
a velvet material so these are the
bottoms they've just got like an elastic
waistband which is super comfy like has
enough stretch fits really well on the
waist and stuff like that and then it
just goes down and it's got slightly
coughed ankles nothing like super tight
what just kind of cuffs off at the
bottom and like I said it is just velvet
so those are the buttons
the top is a Zippo they did actually
have to sort of like options on the
website so they had either like the
velvet zipper or they had a velvet
cropped hoodie and I just feel like the
zip up looks so much keep cuter again it
is cropped I don't have any like cropped
velvet stuff and I just thought it
looked really lovely on the model and
it's got a gold zip and again it's just
the exact same material with like
slightly puffed sleeves and stuff like
that the bottom is kind of like elastic
a it's slightly as well and they look
really lovely together really
comfortable aren't really flattering
that they fit really well all of this
I've gotten a small by the way every
single thing I got in a size small so
it's like extra small small medium large
it just fits really well absolute little
bit I feel like it's gonna be something
that I wear all the time
and then as you all know if you've
watched my other hauls or if you watch
the last haul I have a current obsession
with like Sutton joggers that have the
stripes on the side just love them
absolutely obsessed with them I have a
black a black pair sorry from misguiding
which I wear all the time and and again
they've got a bunch of color of colors
of these oh my gosh I when I online shop
I will like polos my basket and then I
basically won't check out for like two
or three days because it'll just be a
process of me trying to cut stuff down
because I'm like honey
you don't need all this and they have a
red pair and I really wanted the red
pepper and but because I didn't check
out for so long they sold out in size
small and I'm so annoyed so I've set off
a car key which I don't mind like I
really like the color anyway so there
are similar styles the last ones except
they do have a drawstring I'm pretty
sure the velvet ones dome the one thing
that we will say about these is the
waistband is a lot tighter it's still
stretchy and elasticated and stuff so
it's not like a massive deal but it is
quite tight so that's the only thing
that I will say about those just bear in
mind for size in the material is really
lovely it's quite thin stuff in and but
as you can see it's like really shiny
and it just looks so nice on its really
computer that's like super soft okay and
then the next thing this is the only
piece that was kind of difficult to cut
on like I genuinely so this is a leather
skirt and I honestly couldn't get this
on unless I put it over my
like it wouldn't go over my hips so I
had to put it on over my head because I
knew it would fit my waist I do have
like slightly wider hips in comparison
to my waist and then it did fit really
well I don't know what to make of that
because I feel like I'm not gonna want
to put a skirt over my head after I've
done my makeup and stuff but it's not
like a major thing it did actually fit
really well when I got it on so I tried
to put it on open my booty first and it
just would not go because the zip just
doesn't go down far enough I don't think
and then I put it over and it looks
really lovely and it actually fits
perfectly on the way so I guess it's
kind of good thing and but it's just a
leather skirt it's just black as you can
see it's got a little button and then it
has got a zip as well and it's got two
little pockets at the front and then
each side it's got kind of this lace up
detail which I really really loved it's
just like a miniskirt I basically used
to love I used to have one from
misguided like a black faux leather
miniskirt and I don't know where it when
it got lost in all wave of stuff and so
I've been on the hunt for a new one for
quite a while and I just love this one
because I feel like it's a really good
combination of like a daytime I'm the
nighttime skirt if that makes sense like
I'd wear this out to town because it's
got like the laces and stuff but I could
easily pad it with like a pair of boots
oh I like tights or something like in
the day and it would still make a really
nice daytime outfit so that is that just
admitted by mind if you have got wider
hips that it's hard to get on and then
the last thing and this isn't off the
shoulder like fluffy top so I used to
have a block
fluffy top ages ago I got it from Miss
average when I used to work there and I
got rid of it it was kind of like a
round neck and it was like cropped as
well like this one's cropped I just
don't wear out so I got rid of it and
then for ages I've been looking for once
like powered jeans and stuff like autumn
and winter time and I saw this one and
just thought it was so cute it literally
is just like a Bardo like after shoulder
cropped up just like so it's super soft
and super fluffy it's just two pair like
except with jeans and like probably the
leather skirt or something like that
oh I lied actually I have Topshop stuff
as well I have two things from Topshop
to show so yeah that was everything at
from mesh key if I'm saying it right and
I really do love the sight like I don't
doesn't recommend it delivery was super
quick as I said and the stuff is from
what I have is real
see so that is that I got two things
from a Topshop so the first one is a
dress which is going to be hard to show
off camera but you'll see it in the I
mean on camera but you'll see it in the
Tryon clip and so as you can see it's
just a sort of like teal color I would
say it's not like blue or green it's
kind of like somewhere in the middle
it's got little sleeves that kind of
tight up and then they have got like a
little Boop and then it basically wraps
around it's really hard to show and but
you'll see when I try it on and then
it's got a hem that kind of like dips at
the back so it's shot at the front and
then longer at the back which I just
think it's really lovely it's basically
just like a flowy midi dress I saw this
in the shop they had it in green like
this greeny colour and then they had it
in a more like blue color and I just
thought it'd be really lovely for summer
I have to say I was gonna wear this on
Charlie's like birthday party is not 18
yet but we did have a pipe from in like
the summer holidays but I had red hair
at the time like when I did my hair red
with the Clairol color crave and it just
didn't quite look right so I'm gonna
save it for something I don't know what
I'm gonna wear it for yeah but I'm just
gonna keep it anyway because I do really
love it it was 46 pounds and I got it in
a size 8 and it fits really well so that
is that okay and then the second thing
that I got from Topshop I did order
these both online I didn't buy them in
stores so this is just a body suit I saw
this and I was like okay I need it
because basically it's just a little
black body suit which just says New York
on the front as you can see and me and
my family I go into New York in November
I am so excited because I've never been
before and we're actually going when
it's gonna be Black Friday so sales I
literally I got this to our New York
what can I say so it's dead simple in
terms of the body to you it's just you
know cotton I would say like a jersey
material and it's just got little straps
and I tried it on it's not like too
short on the body but for some reason
like the leg holes feel really tight I
don't know what it was like it just feel
really tight on my life so hopefully
they're gonna I don't know hopefully I
can find a way to make them comfortable
and but in terms of the Lincoln stuff it
didn't suffocate the vajayjay that's all
there is to know okay and then I've got
three things from I saw it first
which I purchased myself they actually
had a 50% off sale like loose jaws of
doing sales recently I don't
I feel like it was maybe from back
holiday but they had 50% off and I
picked up three things so the first
thing is a little cocky like buddy con
hot material as you call this it's like
a little ruffle top so it's literally
just Bardot and it's just got two little
sleeves like so super simple I'm pretty
sure this is quite affordable anywhere
like everything on I saw it first
is relatively affordable I think it was
about like 12 pounds or so I just
thought it was really cute so like
pallid jeans and things like that and I
got to size a it fits but it's tight
like it's quite tight to get on but at
the same time I'd rather it was tight
than like loose if you know it makes
it's one of those materials where you
don't want to have to keep pulling it ox
it is like like strapless on the other
thing as well is like the bottom is
really weird like you'll probably be
able to see in the trail clip but the
ruffles just aren't even on the bottom
so rather than just leave it like that
I've just kind of I kind of folded it in
on itself instead and I prefer that much
more than what the actual and and like
the length of the top is it just looks
way better in my opinion I don't know
what's going on the bottom but I don't
like it okay and then this little top oh
my gosh this is so cute I'm pretty sure
again this is like maybe I don't know
like 17 pounds or so it's just a white
ruffled top a white ruffle top so it's
kind of like a v-neck
what just happened that and then it has
got like ruffles we used again it's kind
of hard to show off camera but your seat
and the trend clip absolutely love this
it's got a little gold zipper at the
back as well which means it's really
easy to put on because I literally just
undid the zip that goes all the way down
watch it over my head put my arms in the
sleeves and then - should do this a pop
at the back my so it's got a peplum
bottom so it's all just quite roughly
and like peplum II I just love these
sorts of tops to go with like skinny
jeans and like a pair of sandals or
boots or heels like whatever it may be
it's really well I was worried when I
first going on that it was gonna be a
little bit big on the boob area and but
when I sort of play with it and put it
around and stuff it's not that bad and
it's something that I could probably
wear a bra with anyway so that is that
really love that really love that and
then the very last thing that I got from
ISO Affairs I picked up another part of
the wide leg trousers these are my
favorite wide leg trousers ever these
and like my misguided ones but obviously
these ones are like a
the price so I have them in black nudes
and blush pink I think oh and camel I
don't know I have them in black blush a
nude I'm pretty sure so have them in
three colors and I've never had a pair
of white wide leg trousers and I've
always wanted a pair so I thought I'd
pick them up because I already know my
size and like I know that they fit and
they look good so I got a guest size 8
in them and the only thing that I will
say about them is they can be a bit
see-through so you have to be careful
about what underwear you wear underneath
but for the price like honestly that's
such a good pair of wide leg trousers
are a really nice material they feel
thick comfortable to wear flattering
like I wear my black ones all the time
like all the time I loved him so much so
yeah that was everything that I picked
up for this haul I really hope you all
enjoyed it and found some stuff it maybe
you want to try like I said I found mesh
key recently and I'm loving it so yeah
as I said all of the outfits and all of
what my future outfits and things will
be on 21 buttons from now on so make
sure you go and follow me on that and we
can have a chat and stuff and discuss
outfits and I'll make sure to link as
much of this stuff on that as possible
