not been on YouTube in ages because I
did not upload quite the whole of last
week and the week before I only did one
video with mom and I just like hard
issue last issue if you follow me on
snapchat or other social medias you'll
know that I have not been particularly
well I've had so many issues in my skin
recently I'm still having issues now but
I'm just going to power through and I've
also had like really bad issues like the
medication I was going to for my skin
like it was going to be really bad tummy
and it's just been it's just having a
good time okay there's nothing to
Presley I'm in a new background as well
this is my like part of my filming room
in obviously money flat and there is
going to be like an apartment for soon I
promise I will do that we'll get around
to doing it and I'm just kind of like
still getting everything done again
everything like settled and put in and
like picking stuff up I'm probably going
to have a play around with this setting
as well and because I feel like it's a
little bit off balance and may arts ally
and ignite that so don't mind if I'm
still having like a play around and this
looks a little bit different in a couple
of videos if you've got any suggestions
or anything like that unfortunately I
really wish I could put fairy lights up
like I did in my old videos and I can't
like nail stuff to the wall because I do
rent this apartment yeah this is like
the bad this is a second bad this is
like not the best of me in month on
Bobby I'm sorry that kind of been an mi
a I'm here I felt like I just needed to
take a week off to sort of allow myself
to get a bit better and I'm still not
100% but I really just missed film in it
so we're just going to push through and
go with it but I start back with a
clothing haul because I actually bought
a lot of this stuff maybe like a week
and a half nearly two weeks ago and I've
been dying to unbox it all and like get
into it I'm not really worn a lot of
bits be honest I have been waiting to
haul it so I got some stuff from
misguided a pretty little thing and
maybe a sauce as well I don't actually
remember I'm going to start with this
guide and I did buy all of this myself a
little misguided do some with stuff
sometimes but I did pay for all of this
with my own money okay so the first
thing I got from misguided and they've
got a lot of these choker tops at the
minute which is sort of la la la la la
la I cannot speak I've forgotten how
sweet this is Providence when you have a
week off I don't know how to seek any
well yeah as a minute they've got a lots
of these sort of choco top so they have
AV nut and then the sort of choker
neckline
and this is just a short-sleeved one and
it says will trouble talk it just looks
like so this is kind of like the
plainest out of all of them and I
personally don't like anything that's
like too much of a loud print I know I'm
like super boring and what you all know
me I usually wear black I mean look at
me and look at me now this has a sort of
a simplest plainest print on and it
looks really lovely on the module just
to power we like jeans and leggings and
stuff and I got it in a size small this
is like a small medium or like a small
to medium medium/large situation I think
and I can't remember how much it was but
I'll have everything it listed down
below as always and that is that rate
this next thing is so creased because
it's been in the package for ages now
and this is just a plain white shirt it
is honestly I'm really just I got to
make from that now I'm trying really
hard to get out of like mathematical
brunt at the Monaro so this is just a
white button-up shirt it's got a pocket
either side going to be bizarre and it's
just got a normal white color and just
some long sleeves like so so you can
either roll them off or like cut them I
think I like three-quarter length and
it's kind of like a normal length it's
not particularly long or anything like
that but as you can see it's slightly
longer at the back and the way this was
styled on the model she just had like
one side tucked into a pair of jeans and
the other side's just like doing its
thing and I really liked the way it
looked so I got that in an 8 again a
link down below just something really
simple to like pear with like wide leg
trousers or jeans like I feel like a
white shirt it's just a staple or heel
it's a good one and then I picked up a
part of faux leather black skinny jeans
because these has really good reviews on
the website users advice style absolute
I like super high waisted and I got them
in a regular and they fit but they're a
little bit tight and the thing that I
like about them is that they definitely
do have a lot of stretch to them I would
say but the sort of thing where I
couldn't wear these out if I was going
to a meal where I know organelle offers
because like they're really like not
that forgiving you are in between sizes
maybe go up a size but the one thing
that a lot of the reviews did say is
that they were very stretchy so I just
got the aid and they do fit but they're
not the sort of thing that I could wear
when I'm eating a lot of food that's why
yeah the goo feel really comfy don't and
the thing that I do like this at the
abstract you because my issue with like
leather jeans and like so like the
Giunta job I never had a pair because
they're just so all they just make my
skin crawl
when I think about some of the times
I've tried on because they have no
stretch trying to get them over your
legs is just like what LLL honestly it's
just not my cup of tea but these are
quite nice I have to say there's a mark
on the pachyderm which I've just
realized and but yeah they learned about
20 pounds or so I'd say or maybe a
little bit less I can't remember
battling them down below and then this
was in the new inception which it won't
be anymore because they got it like two
weeks ago
so with these are just some wide-leg
don't mind me
these are just some wide like a black
trousers and they're in like the tall
section which I like because one thing I
struggle with on misguided is like the
high I don't know this is also models
are so tall but when it comes to body
body suits and stuff but they just don't
put me on the toss and I'm like how is
your model like 5 foot 10 and I have
five foot seven and fits her but it
don't fit me how to say I got these in
an a and I like a little bit too big if
you're in between sizes that maybe say
go down the one thing I will say because
I have already tried these on some was
going to wear them to an event one the
getting really bad camel toe removing
the lies these gave me really bad camel
toe just I'd like to think I've show
them they're just wide leg trousers and
they're ribbed and another thing is that
the see-through like probably not gonna
be able to see because it's like two
layers and but you can cut yet you can
see like they're the pristy see through
but just a little bit detailed oaks have
got like a d-ring belt and then I did
get matching top because it's like a
two-piece or not you know that is right
now and the light feels lovely that
they're super long and the really comfy
but they probably will have to go back
on whether a dirty never comes in the
back Nelson set like I'm filming this
hole so late and but one thing I bear in
mind the procedure I'm not no I okay and
then these are a pattern white trousers
and the reason I bought these is because
I recently got a pair and Rachel from
shop style very kindly when she sent
over some the stuff the last misguided
haul one of the things I forgot to show
were like the black and the like black
dog is but they're like a nice material
like this not like jogger material like
chef Ronnie I'll insert a picture where
I've got them on here and they were
black with white stripes on the side and
I love them they are so easy to wear
so is it style like really comfortable
and but they don't look like cheap if
you not I mean
and so they had these white pad
they have this white pair sorry and the
thing that I really liked about these is
that at the bottom where they're wide
like to start the difference either ones
because the other ones are tapered and
but you can basically zip up the way it
would start on the model is that you can
zip up the uncool section like the
bottom of the lab and you can wire like
a pair of heels or something with them
and then obviously like this sort of
shows your heel and it's just like a
really nice way of dressing them up I
feel like it makes them feel a little
bit more glam they feel really thick and
which is good the one thing I'm worried
about because my friend Millie bought
them as well and that there's pockets at
the front here and because they're white
like you can really I think you can kind
of see where the pocket line is which is
running on tap here so I can really hate
it when trousers do that and but we'll
try it on we'll give them a go there
were certain parts that they weren't
particularly cheap against misguided and
but yeah we'll get them a go hopefully I
love them as much as the black ones
because those I love and again I'll put
those in the description box you want
this is this hot that much is the wide
leg trousers so again this is in this
whole range and again it's like a ripped
material I don't think I mentioned that
about the charges but it's like it's
staying ripped material it's got like a
title match I got flood sleeves which I
thought was really lovely like they're
just adds a little bit of some
intellectual really plain top and then
again it's just got the ring right there
yes the ring sort of detail on it as
well and I feel like it doesn't really
matter if the top see through because
you can put like a brawler off and
underneath it the trousers are a bit
more of an issue in my opinion and I'm
going to try it on and see how it goes
it definitely is like the same material
that's like trying to see through and
but yeah that is like the top version I
get some misguided
oh my god okay this is humungous the
reason I got it is because I was eyeing
it up a white light not while ago but a
couple of months ago when it was like
couldja and it was full price at the
time but now obviously it's getting into
like warmer like Springs from the time
and it's like a massive rocks coat so it
went it went into the sale it's
basically a massive like when I say long
line it's like to you you know and then
it's got a fairy code and it is sucked
in but it doesn't feel like shitty stuff
and if you know I'm here got gold
details like or zips and so
and I just loved the way it looked on
here I feel like it's one of those
things that you can throw on and I just
absolutement an outfit and it also keeps
you warm like obviously I'm not going to
need it no in spring and summer and I'm
probably going to save this like colder
days because we are in Manchester in the
UK obviously and then against like
awesome winter to style there like I
said this have come in since ml which is
why I picked it up because it was 50
pounds I think which is pretty good for
like a hacky coat like a parka toe and
originally it would buy 80 pounds I
believe so if it's still in stock which
I'm pretty sure it is because there's a
lot of sizes left I'll link it down
below and we just got cost of sleeves as
well so yeah this next thing again from
scouted and this I loved the look of
started it's black so obviously I'm
going to love it this is a t-shirt dress
and I've been waiting for ages for them
to start bringing out like good t-shirt
dresses again with obvious like
spring/summer it's a season flora and I
just love them because especially for
like quality times they're so easy to
just throw on and then pop up our butt
sandals or trainers on and just have an
outfit and be good to go so this one is
black and I have to say it feels
different to how I imagine it feel it's
kind of like cotton like really soft
cotton which isn't a bad thing and but
it does fit doesn't feel like as sick as
I expected it to and then it's just got
a really sort of deep core crisscross
lace-up Center what you actually call
these like a neckline and then the other
thing that it's got is at the bottom is
kind of like cutout here as you can see
well at the bottom of the dress is and
similarly on the arms as well as just
got caught our arms like on the shoulder
like elbow bit and I'm going to look at
it because it's so like me okay so again
I don't know if this stuff is going
stuck anymore but I got em to pieces
from the Jordan Jon and misguided
collaboration which is called London I
think okay and this one again it just
screams me oh my god it's black I have
issues so this is just a cropped sweater
that they show George
Jordan oh la la la la Jordan dawn is a
model and she collaborated into the
collection with misguided it was very it
was very much it's very like mono
monochrome like blacks whites and like
jumpers body suits like kind of the
tracksuit bottoms like I just showed and
so
like street wear but can be dressed up
at the same time I just really love like
the whole feel of it a crotch like off
the shoulder jumper which I really love
because I feel like I'd never see stuff
like this
but it just looks so comfy and so cozy
but you could select put it on with a
pair of like jeans or tapered Chaz's and
like heels and just hit a lot so yeah
that is the first piece that I got and I
got one other as well so this right here
is um it's like a bodysuit hoodie I
think yeah so this is they have a couple
of you so basically did like everything
in white black and grey which I thought
was really cool it's basically a hoodie
that's a bodysuit which I just thought
was so interesting because I've never
really come across anything like that
before especially from like brands like
misguided and stuff like that yeah it's
pretty much just an oversized hoodie
it's got wide arms which I really like
because my fancy Puma from Rihanna
and my little pony has wisely a kind of
whispers wide sleeve arms and I just
love the way they look because they just
make everything look really oversized
and really like edgy and it has got the
sort of logo at the bottom in like a
leather it's like a faux leather print
and then there's just a hard and it's
got a super big like hoodie tassels
which I really like and then it just
goes down into a body sue and Lord pray
that this does not suffocate the BOJ no
it is elastic which is actually quite
nice because honestly this guy didn't
nobody says I can't cope I just thought
it was really different they had it in
with the white text at the bottom as
well but I kind of didn't want to see
the logo as such and so I got in the
black and I'm pretty sure they do do it
in like a white and a gray maybe as well
and but I'm really excited to like try
that on and see what it looks it's a
Saab looks like sorry it's the sort of
thing that I was paired with my black
tapered judges would like the stripes
down the side and like a pair of I don't
know shoes okay I'm pretty sure that was
everything it from misguided I'm going
to do a pretty little thing nap okay so
the first two things that I got from
pretty petite little things these are
actually the only things that I planned
on getting and the other two things kind
of just happened
and because these I did actually own
like I don't know where they went
do they know just how close that just
disappear like I have no idea its weight
as well because it's exact same
jean-claude I had it in black ins
pink and I just said I was gone I really
don't see is quite assembly at just
cropped John Kerr and and I just seem to
get so much you start abuse they
literally are just like they're not
hoodie or anything they're just sort of
like the necklines like that it's not
super wide but not super tight and then
it just goes into kata sleeves and then
it just held like a cut off like sort of
raw hem and bottom and I just got so
much use out of these because I've had
them with tracksuit bottoms with
leggings with jeans like I've had them
with so many things like anything that
was high waisted pretty much because I
do like to power highway to stuff with
like crop top to Mike crop jumpers I
guess and but yeah I just love them but
I have no idea where they went I must've
left them at someone's house or
something along those lines and but they
are super affordable
anyway they're only 12 pounds so I just
got one in black and then one in and
baby pink which is just like a nude
color and and they're just good staple
for me I was so upset when I moved out
and as we've gone through my wardrobe
microfinance I was like I need to pick
up another two and luckily they were
serene so I don't know how many sizes
are left but if you like stuff like what
I wear I guess and you like sort of
typing comfy casuals and I would
definitely recommend these the one thing
I will say is a very short court and
I'll only a c-corp I'm like they rise up
quite high on me I would say and I get
them in a size 10 so just in to bear in
mind for anyone who's kind of busty
because I used ester weapon would like a
brawler or like a Calvin Klein like
bralette so it doesn't look like too
wrong I guess um but yeah other than
that I love them yeah and then these two
things just kind of happen when I'm like
checking out so first one is really
simple and it's just a like bandeau top
and I just loved it because it felt like
two little cutouts either side which
would just go to crush your boobies like
so and you'd actually get it to go with
I was going to wear this with the wide
leg trousers from misguided that had
like the ring bell and but when I saw
that they will see through and they gave
me a colorful I didn't wasn't in the
answer but I will find other use for
this so yeah it's just simply like it
kind of like a slinky material and feel
quite soft just go to question bubs and
then it's got the cutouts bar
outside so guys if I get a because like
I said I am a c-cup so anything that's
like this region I'll always go 1/8 and
yeah I'm pretty short was super
affordable as well like maybe like 8
pounds or so so I'll link it down below
okay and then these and these are
basically like fish net shorts and so
obviously fish net trend at the minute I
feel like it's just gotten really quite
big I have a fish net types which I
actually got from Windsor store and I
love them so much but the one thing that
I always like I remember now turning out
the almond I was with to my friends
money and sharifa and I was like I wish
I had these but without the like will
convene at height and without incurring
my foot because I wanted to wear a pair
of heels but they just looked wrong
because the fishnet went over my feet
and let you could see on the heel and
stuff I was like I wish I just had a
pair of short and nearly caught them and
then they were like no don't do it
because I'd regret it and then I saw
these on pretty little thing and they
literally are just fishnet shorts so I
feel like if you're someone who wants to
wear the fishnet trend and have like the
sort of obviously you'll have like if
this is high waisted you'll see this
section in like um the waist line if
you're not really like the waist and the
sort of top of the fishnet and then
you'll Heidi trousers and these are like
I've got alternatives because another
thing with a fishnet side that there's
such a bitch to get on just so
appreciate in and they're really not the
complete thing ever because like they
get all up in your toes and just like
now if you like those a really long chat
about fishnet tights but yeah these are
just fishnet cycle shorts and again go
to the summertime because you could wear
them with like distress just a lot of
our distrust sure great that's a lot of
stuff is from ASOS and the thing that I
love bitterly I got three pairs of shoes
and I think that I love about shopping
for shoes on a sub is that they let you
have a filter for wide fit shoes because
my feet are wide so when I try and buy
yields and stuff from like boohoo or
misguided or wherever it is ninety
percent of time I can't wear them
because they're not wise enough murphy
and it's so uncomfortable so I really
love that a sauce offer a salted some
wipes it I just I love it it's a good
idea so what this first part just
reminded me so much of a pair of shoes
that I used to have from Topshop that I
love
dearly but they were so uncomfortable
and they're just like slip-ons and
they're kind of just got like a white
sick soul and they're just black snake
skin I used to have to person pop shops
and pop shops top shop rather than
explore because when I get wife's get
shoes I think that man's house which
before usually I have to go five and
yeah I just thought these would be
really nice for like spring summer times
like sarong with a pair of jeans and
because I really wanted a pair of shoes
that I could wear casually that weren't
trainers because I live in trainers and
a little bit but it kind of gets your
point where it's like okay sometimes I
actually need to look less of a scruff
and like about to the made an effort so
I feel like these are a nice in between
Tyler and yeah but just black and white
black and white okay and then these gosh
no I don't like seeing that these are
probably gonna have to go back but like
can I even return them now when I've
probably had the modern and we're not to
check afterwards but these are like
wired fit so I basically bought two
pairs of shoes but all the ones I'll
show you in a minute and I needed a pair
of heels like comfy heels for the
Britain's Next Top Model event which I
went to with like Rachel and million
Alex not so long ago and so between
these and another pass-through minute I
tried both on I tried it wanna beat John
and to start as beads are so wide fit
like really quite wide and I have wide
feet so surprised that they like almost
too wide for me and then the second
thing is this buckle situation was so
uncomfortable like walking oh no I can't
do it because it's like it sat on my
ankle
so like this buckle was like on my ankle
in it which is making me cringe so badly
because it's like hard muscle and it's
just like feels from home and it's
anyone got a problem like if anything
metal is on my uncle like natural ankle
bone I'm just like no be such a shame
though because I love the fact that it's
such a wide and uncle well I have to say
the heel is very small and but the job
that it doesn't really muscle like the
heel height because for some reason a
thick fun kind of like mix up for it and
doesn't make it look as more I don't
know it's weird and but yeah they did
look really nice on and I do want to
keep them so badly but it was just so
comfortable and
they're lying there really well the
other half which is the pair that I did
actually wear oh my god these are like
not looking good no these are a little
bit these are like a little bit less
dressy because I like a sec of black
heels so I feel like these could be more
casual and again quite wide fit I was
surprised because again I have white
feet and they really are a special idea
just so wide and but they weren't like
to the point where they like
excruciating through the night like they
weren't super comfortable there weren't
the confuse things that I've ever worn
I'm not gonna lie but they weren't like
the worst things I've ever worn either
and they basically got your strap and it
sort of crosses over and then ties
around and then it does up like so again
oh my goodness this strap by the way I'm
probably gonna how to torture hole in
this because it doesn't go small enough
if you know what I mean like it's really
wide again I don't know what it is but I
mean I didn't remind these because these
were the ones that I've worn obviously I
will keep them now because I've worn
them and there's a lot of things that I
dressed like meals and dinners and stuff
I'm not going to do a lot of walking I
wouldn't worry Stu like a party I don't
think because I feel like they're just a
bit uncomfortable I did look really nice
with the outfit that I wore whatever I
just wore and like black jeans I think I
like black bundage leggings and then a
sort of cropped find the top but was
like to talk fast and a long dress and
not long Jess Elanco and it did look
really nice and they did the job feel
like I've spoken so much but honestly
it's just because I've missed you so
much
I feel like I just like rumbled for so
long because I really miss filming like
so much and I'm pretty sure I'm going to
have a Sephora haul on Thursday and I'm
like a testing video on Sunday because
obviously this can go up and she say
instead but yes I really hope you all
enjoyed it I'm sorry it was really long
enough to psych oh we're going to that
year and really I'm sorry but I just I
don't know I just end up yeah and I'm
just yeah thank you so much for watching
I love you guys to the moon and back I
am going to go because when you can't
drink it but I will see you in this
