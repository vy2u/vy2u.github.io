a massive like my hope is going to be a
huge misguided hole because I feel like
this time it's so long like forever I
left in a hole and I know you will love
them and I love them as well also I
realized this background is so important
like this is the most for about however
this used to be where my clothing rail
was in my mind like what was it goals is
to help display thing was ever seen as
I'm moving out everything's good like no
joke this is the last video that I'm
going to film in this light and it kind
of makes me a little bit sad not quite
everything just looks a little bit dull
I'm still fat I'm same chair that I
always sit on but I've not really got
anything in the flat that looks pretty
enough to film with so this is what
we're dealing with but it's fine because
it's gonna be a hole with like try and
clips and stuff so hopefully that makes
up for a little bit so I want to say
some of the clothes in this hole very
kindly gifted over to me by shop files
and thank you so much for helping me do
this video and then a couple of things
as well I have perches myself so I'm
going to split it into two and do the
stuff that's been it gifted sir okay so
so I'm going to try and do this as quick
as I can and not ramble too much because
the stone is sat in and I've probably
got about 20 minutes and 12 in time so
fingers crossed up and all okay so seen
it we are I don't say we're getting into
colder months it's like and of August
now nearly what kind of middle of August
but it's getting into like awesome time
winter time which is my favorite time of
year I love Christmas so much I picked
up a couple expressive so the first one
is just literally just a cream plane
it's less than just because I don't have
a white cream twice a school and I've
been really enjoying wearing like jeans
it's just a minute I just love pairing
like really basics tops with them so
just like plain sweaters and plain tops
and things like that so that is all this
is it's cropped as well which is ideal
for me because as I said as you are
jeans and stuff so it always looks a lot
that I would like high-waisted jeans
because it's not too long not me and I
got this in a size small medium and
pretty sure these are quite affordable
on the website as well that you do them
in a ton of colors yes it's really
simple which is just eight knitted
sweater but it's such a good go through
I feel like I feel like as well as with
so many things great the next slicer
again it's cropped I have an obsession
with like cropped arts and crafts
letters because I do webs and we like
high-waisted jeans as well I've got
well our longest sleeves and the are
frayed at the end like the whole jumper
kind of has a rock like spread material
texture vibe going on because this one
episode is just gray it says some new on
the bottom I just I was really cute like
I love the pop of color in the right day
and it looks really cozy
I looked outside on the website and it
makes a nice difference from my clean
jumpers as the one I just show yeah okay
so next I got two pairs of joggers
because I really enjoy wearing sweats
and rugged and just like concrete
clothes so the first pair I just black
literally just plain a black jacket I
don't have any I've been stealing my
mom's one like my mom has a really nice
pair of like nineteen joggers and I just
kept doing them and she's getting soaked
up a bit so pick some Optimus guiding I
love these ones because they have a
really lovely and detail on the knee
where it's all red they are like paper
juggle as well that cost at the bottom
as you can see and they're just got a
lot more drawstring as most joggers do I
might pretty much it you can just see
what this the rips on the knees there's
no other like beater and other than that
I just think it's really simple but
effective and then I also just got some
pink ones these don't have any like
detailing like bricks or anything like
that but they're kind of a stone wash so
they're not properly like they're not
like a flat full of paint you can kind
of see on the what is called way fun you
know because the other ways fun it's
kind of like different colors of pink
it's just like a wash like a CD and
child pink color I love the color pink
as well I guess how many comes are just
making comments I love the pocket kind
of nude you think like it's not super
dark or like saturate during select are
and I love it busy filling on the
waistband that the actual drawstring
it's like a little lace top situation
here okay next thing this is super
random I I don't even know how I came
across this on the website but it just
looked really lovely on the model so
this is a little black bra and I've got
one further black bralette that I
absolutely love but it's kind of it's
not like this one it's all kind of
pestilent at the bottom it kind of pops
out or if the other one is like a proper
like
and the way it's Caroline's body Kyle
and bralette the situation oh my god and
why can I go to Christ just today so I
just wanted something a little bit
different to happen my wardrobe as well
because they're really versatile it you
can wear this with so many things you
can dress it up and sort of why it was
like a skirt or wide leg trousers or you
could just have it as a daytime ring and
part with it's like pair of jeans got a
little bit at the back to help you get
it on and then it's also just got some
little detail in like it's kind of
nested around the center before it goes
into like the pack alone and it's got
adjustable straps as well which is
really hungry really important for me
because I feel like things that don't
have adjusted sharp now they're just
never set my chest area that always way
too big but yeah absolutely love that so
it was really super cute so I'm excited
to style it don't know what happened on
the label that I'm also honey okay and
then I got to look black places because
I used to love wearing play suits like
go out and Jos was like a pair of heels
or lasik sandals and then for some
reason I don't know where the ball gone
like I know one I have to get color on a
night owl which is just a whole
different story
basically the zip broke and like either
I was saying that I like you really need
to get this place it off me because I'm
actually just going to push myself so
she hasn't caught me out of it because
it just wouldn't undo and then I headed
to the one but I feel like I just got
lost so I wanted to start off on a
couple of new at black places because
they're so easy places and just Phe just
put it on and it's an outfit like I just
love them so this one is strapless
it's got no please no straps anything
like that it's kind of like a sweetheart
neckline which I thought was really cute
because I love this kind of neckline and
just think it's really faster in and
then a caballo just has a dorsal this
it's got a bunch of sort of like mesh
detail and things at the front and it
also has a little cutout as well like
towards like just underneath your
boobies and then it kind of goes out and
quite slowly short this is quite dressy
for me like I looked at this on the
website and I was kind of Orman and are
and about it because it's not something
that I'd wear a lot like I probably wear
this more so on an occasion rather than
a night owl and I just really looked a
little bit anyway I feel like black with
a tan and stuff when you super glam like
it just always looks good okay and then
the second place you have to say it
feels a lot thinner so this
so it's actually a bar go this one is
got tiny little sleeps here this again
looks really cute on the model I just
got sucked in it something looks good on
website I'm just like yes please
yeah just ate result bar gel with tiny
sleeves and then it kind of like a
layered play suit so it's just got a
layout where the top is and then it goes
into the shop again and it's quite a
textured fabric I wonder what kind of
fabric this is but if your question I
have to say hopefully it looks nice on
okay so next thing is a pair of jeans
and I just looked like the sort of style
of these so they're just new jeans and
then they've got leaflets on above the
legs that go all the way down it can
also have these in white but I just do
not trust myself with white jeans I feel
like they look lovely on but I just ruin
anything wild like issue especially
jeans though because especially when I'm
start doing makeup and stuff and like
start having food
she's not such here and I feel like nude
just goes and more things so I'm hoping
that these are going to look good but
yeah I feel like these are more of a
dressy Jean so I probably pad these with
like heels and then a bralette top or
like a body C or something like that so
yeah fingers crossed big bit okay
neck alright helping on the climate for
a pair of leggings slash Charles's like
this for so long and I've bought so many
different pairs and tried so many
different parts and they just never seem
to fit right so I'm hoping these do
these are bandage leggings and I have to
say anything that misguided doors at
bundage but I like it I mean I just
can't do any wrong like I love the whole
range of bundage stuff at the jew so as
I said these are funded leggings and
they basically just have lace up at the
size so we are quite dressy and quite
you know cheap cheap well honestly I've
seen these on so many people and like
when they look good they look amazing
like it just looks really flattering you
can pair them again with so many
different things like body foods or
bundles heart I'm kind of wishing I got
an A I do to get an A in bondage stuff
what sometimes I do have to size up in
miscarriage houses and so now we'll see
what they're like on
hopefully they'll be okay what if not
I'll just exchange them they do feel
really good quality they're really
expect to just feel like the Sun a bunch
of stuff that misguided it does and oh
yeah those are those okay and then the
last thing is that shop style very
kindly sent over about this is a body
sue and this is in like this whole
section of the body suits that miss
going to do have to say a half for like
one because you all know like I can't
buy a normal body suits miscarried
because we just suffocate mother judge
but I have fought one too long before
and I have to say like there was no
difference in like the actual length of
it I was so baffled I was like how is
this class's tall militias like the same
no but then I have had one other one
from this like this whole section of
body suits and it was absolutely fine
like it was a lot longer so I was
literally confused in the inconsistency
so I wanted to give this whole section
another go because I saw this and so it
was really lovely and simple and just
like a go-to piece to have I've been
looking for ages for a long please white
bodysuit just for like layer in and pair
with jeans and like wide like childhoods
and things like that so I saw this one
on the website and so it looks really
lovely it's literally as I'll is a
long-sleeve white boy do have to say it
does look long like this looks promising
boys and girls I'm hoping this is going
to be a good one it's got a slight Gina
yes carbine up and it's just a rubber
material and it feels really nice and
soft so fingers crossed like this fits
really well and it's going to become one
of my favorite pieces in my wardrobe
because you could just tie this with
anything I feel like next thing yeah I
think I need up on the website for a
while these are body suits but they're
part of the peace and love range which
is the more sort of like and premium
range that mascara does so it's
literally joy it's not much no it's okay
so it's literally just a whole snake's
body - I've wanted a health nut but it's
super so long but I can tie one that
fits right again have an issue to the
pajayjays it's got a very low back like
super low back and it kind of has like
little buttons at the top to sort of do
it art which is nice but at the same
time I kind of wish it was just showing
off and you could just put it over your
head because like I'm really going to
show up do this on my own
we've got the tiny little elastic also
if one fell office it's okay I may just
goes into a buddy sue it does feel
really lovely because it's like the
seasonal range if you're really soft
what's it at the same time and I'm just
gonna act like I'm just hoping it's
going to be long enough for it to work
for me I just see one of the reviews on
the website what is my hat
I do see a review on the website that
said it is a nice line so fingers
crossed it is so I can just hear like
sirens and all souls going on side I did
get it in at nude as well so I'm just
showing you the white on for reference
because they're all the exact same but
these tub it and white nude and black
I'll link them all down below if I can
we are just hoping that it's going to be
long enough for my body
so we'll see when I try it on but again
if it is and I feel like this will just
be a staple because it's so simple but
again just went with so many things okay
and then the last thing oh my gosh dude
will like a miracle purchase because I
basically I used to have a pair of a
kind of like juggled cigarette trousers
from misguided and quite a while ago now
they're literally exact in sales so
black you like a white stripe down the
outside of each leg I love them so much
like I I just love them I didn't have
anything else like at my wardrobe I
wasn't all the time because they went
with everything and I was like to wash
them like they got really bubbly like I
don't know if anyone has that I mean but
you know when you wash them in and the
texture goes really bubbly and it's not
anything you can fix or like take off
because it's just some materials just
one so I have to bend them unfortunately
which I was so sad about because I was
like I love these shadows so much but
they're just gonna look really scruffy
so I saw these on the website and and
they're pretty much since it's the same
thing sorry so they are just kind of
like jogger cigarettes houses they've
got a drawstring at the least fun and
then again it just has stripes down each
side and they just go into like a
tapered jogger and and I still only have
these they have them in this color which
is like we had them in navy blue I'm
pretty sure there's like green and then
also maroon so they had them in a ton of
different colors and I kind of only
really wear black like
I knew I'd get the muscle at the black
but when I went on the blocks I was like
no side with laughs it was completely
sold out I was like why he says me was
my life but then I didn't actually check
out when I was shopping I didn't check
out until the day after and I still have
the top opens these ones and i refresh
the page and there was like one size ten
laughs and I was like oh my god this is
mercy it was like somewhat of like
return them or just found stock
somewhere and just put it on website and
I was like thank you so I feel like
these are blessing my last ones were in
an a and they fit me perfectly so even
though these are ten I'm hoping I'll be
able to like adjust them with the
drawstring and stuff but honestly like I
wasn't so much I was like I need a new
pair they do have a lot of similar
styles and website well they just didn't
have any like simple like any other
simple platforms with a white stripe
which is just what I won here and so
yeah fingers crossed they like custom
more as anyone's interested all I have a
back and start my house fillings and
nuts down below and but yet honestly if
they go through but I love them so much
okay so that was everything I got from
mister I did in everything that was also
gifted and sent Albert from shell style
thank you so much because I cannot wait
to try these on and wear them I really
hope you all enjoyed this video I will
look everything down below as always let
me know if you've got any questions
about any of the clothes on you have to
try out clip so I'm going to insert
later I kind of like noose against the
habit of doing try on coats first
because I feel like then I can talk a
little bit more about the actual product
so I'm hopefully going to do that like
more in future and but I've honestly
been so busy and so crazy that I just
did not have time to organize themselves
for this video because my life is in
like I'm running around like a headless
chicken 24/7 so yeah I'm going to start
online now because I feel like I'm just
chatting so thank you so much for
watching I love you guys rina back under
in times over and I don't know a lot of
videos I have coming up here I'm not
entirely sure but I will let you know
and Twitter and things like that so be
sure to fold up thank you so much for
watching as I said I love you to the
middle back and I will see you in my
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
