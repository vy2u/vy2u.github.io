clothing haul you know it I've been
going into also in winter I've got some
new clothes and I know what you thinking
Hannah you got new clothes all the time
I just use the seasons as an excuse okay
have to say some of this stuff was
kindly sent to me so don't think I found
it super crazy again which we know I'll
do on a regular basis when it comes to
clothes yes and this stuff will sense me
that other bits I've bought and I really
want to show you guys what I got because
I know you guys love these types of
videos as well
sorry if I sound like really kind of
like bummed off in this video I'm kind
of coming down with a bit of a cold but
we're gonna push through ultimate winter
is my favorite time of year though
especially in terms of light clothing
because if you let you wear most
clothing obviously because it's cold is
so it's no excuse to buy more clothes
you know see why did that yeah I'm going
to show you everything I got I'm feeling
so Christmassy because I was listening
to Christmas me this morning hence the
red lipstick I'm uploading a tutorial
around this look constantly as well if
you want to know what's on my face it
will be up on it Sunday yeah I'm gonna
stop rambling I wish you a boss so the
first lot of stuff that is like closest
to me it's right here the first lot of
stuff is from Lipsy because if you
didn't know Michelle Keegan has recently
brought out a collection with Lipsy it's
so so stunning they very kindly email me
and asked if I wanted to pick out a
couple of pieces so of course I said yes
because I love lips the I love Michelle
Keegan and and I love the range it's so
pretty so the first thing is a red dress
which oh my gosh it's red it's Christmas
you know so this is just a bodycon dress
it's got a lot of like lace detail on it
as you can see I don't know why of
silver on hanger yeah it's just got a
lot of lace detail it does up at the
back but it's also got a cutout at the
back and then it's got a sort of
sweetheart neckline
do this in it is really beautiful like
bright red and then they also do a
really sort of bright blue cobalt shade
as well like a blue shade and I'm
obsessed it's like a MIDI length
it looked so stunning on her obviously
on the website everything is pictured on
Michelle Keegan and her figure is like
let's not even talk about ever yeah it
looked really pretty it looked like it
hooked in all the right places and I
just feel that this is perfect for
Christmas because it's obviously red as
well and I don't really own many red
dresses so I'm obsessed with this I love
it and then the next one was my favorite
piece in the whole range I saw there's
that on her
I like died it's so pretty I didn't die
but you know but this is a black dress
and it's got again like a sweetheart
neckline and it's got sort of like
really thin and spaghetti straps that I
just fit the back and then it's just
like black with like black lace detail
all over it it's got a couple of like
panels and whatnot around the waist and
also down the sides there's a little bit
of mesh at the sides as well it's got a
zip at the back and again it's a sort of
like mini length I will try this stuff
on so that you can see and I love this
like it just looked so stunning and
really classy obviously because it's
black as well you could wear it for so
many different things I got this in a
ton of thing so it might be a bit big
I'm hoping it's not going to be but I
was just so in love with it it's kind of
like a little bit in the bottom as
well and it's just like it's to die for
so that is that one and the last thing
that is one of my favourite things
this is a leather jacket so it will
actually go really well with the
leggings I just showed that I'm sorry
that you can like see this oh so this is
a leather jacket I'm pretty sure they do
it in this color which is obviously
black and then she's got like a really
deep red like burgundy shade as well as
you can see it's got like a fur collar
I'm pretty sure this is detachable as
well so you can't wear it without the
collar if you want to and then it's just
like a Sunday sort of like dead knock
denim and leather sort of like biker
jacket with like the zips and whatnot
and it's got a couple of so I kind of
quilted and whatnot down the size and
then it's just got like buckles around
the bottom I do not own a decent leather
jacket apart from this one and then one
about show year and and I've been on the
hunt for one for so long because I feel
like they're really hard to fit like
they always just look so big on my
shoulders I don't know what it is and
but I'm obsessed with this and obviously
with the fair as well is it isn't real
fair in case anyone was running I
wouldn't buy anything that's real fair
and but yeah I love that
I'm obsessed so that was everything it
from Lipsy thank you to Lisa and people
at lipsi for sending those over I'm so
in love and I'll leave a link down below
and I always link everything anyway but
I'll put links down below to everything
that I mentioned in this video and then
next is a sauce I only got two things
from a sauce I think so I'm going to
show you them now ok guys so this jacket
I am obsessive actually got this quite a
while
go and I actually got it where I feel my
last fall but I forgot to include it so
I'm going to include it now you know so
this one is like got a mix of like
leather and then also sort of suede it's
not suede what is it's like I don't know
what to call this it's kind of sweet but
I don't if you can see there's just like
two different materials that it's sort
of alternates between so this leads a
leather and then they've got em fur
lining and then there's also like a bit
of fur on the center of the jacket as
well this is really oversized I
originally got this in ten sorry and
then I had seed back because it was so
big so I changed it for an a and the
eight still is like massive and so if
you quite small I don't know how you'll
feel about this in terms of the fit
because it is really oversized when I
have this on I wear it with like just a
basic t-shirt or like a long sleeve top
and it's all you see because it just
takes up your whole upper body you'll
see what I mean want to try it on and
but it it's just very large fitted so
just bear that in mind if you aren't
going to get it for yourself and but I
love the details on its got like gold
zips and gold buckles and whatnot and it
looks really sort of luxurious on it
keeps you so warm as well like I can
literally wear this with a browser under
me which is why sometimes doing like
apparel leggings or whatever and it
keeps you so one because it's like
completely like fur lined and whatnot
and then the next thing that some of you
may have already seen if you follow me
on Instagram and snapchat and whatnot if
you don't it's hell X when a condor
paulo so this is a jumpsuit again this
is from a source but it's not a sus
brand it's by a brand called is either
pronounced Nana or like Nene is felt
like naa and a basically I went out on
Saturday of last week for Halloween
weekend and I left like my sort of
outfit and look really last-minute like
I literally sort of woke up Friday
morning I was like like I'm going
out tomorrow and I don't you know I'm
dressing up her so I decided to be a cat
original I know
so today's be a cat because obviously
there's not like tons that goes into
like a cat makeup look and I wanted a
really cool like jumpsuit slash cat suit
to wear with it I couldn't find like an
all black cat suit or jump suit to save
my life but I came across this on a
saucer instead and I
love it though this is a jumpsuit it's a
long-sleeve jumpsuit and it's got like
the top part with like mesh and it's got
a sort of diamond pattern all over and
then black tabs down at the sleeves it's
a v-neck and then it just goes into
black trousers I'll put a picture in a
bit here because I'm not going to try on
because what about picture and but I
love this so much is so so comfy it's
got a zip at the back to get it on and
it pulls you in a little bit of the way
so it makes you sort of like take a look
really fluttering and whatnot and I got
this in an a and I'm a sort of like
eight to ten and this is like just the
right size if not a little bit too big I
also got something else from that brand
that I'm going to have to return because
it was way too big that I got in a ten
and so if you sort of in between sizes
and you want to get this I would say go
down a size I probably could have gotten
to a six as well which is crazy because
I'm not six at all and but the material
is very very like stretchy and very sort
of like give it yeah I definitely go
down a size if you're thinking of
getting this and I'm obviously tall as
well I'm five foot seven and I have no
issues with it being like too short on
the body or like the legs being too
short or anything like that I'm just
obsessed with it I think it's only about
20 minutes like 28 pounds of they're
eight pounds or something like that it's
a really good price for what it is and
it's very good material so I love that I
will still wear it even though I got it
for Halloween like out and about
opposites just to jumpsuit and yeah I
can't recommend a lot okay I'm gonna do
a misguided next and this is actually
really exciting for me because misguided
very kindly got into contact with me and
sent some stuff over after they saw that
I did my last haul which was like a
massive massive haul and have it with
them misguided because they had a 50%
off style and they basically saw that
and they contacted me and they asked if
I wanted to like include some stuff in
the next hole that they could send over
for me so thank you to Imogen and the
people at misc I do because I'm obsessed
you were you know I'm obsessed I love
mascara so much these first two things
one of them and it did actually send
over but I saw it on the website and I
was that obsessed with it that I bought
that other two colours of it because I
just loved it so more so these are M
jumpsuits because I'm really loving like
Jersey jumpsuit in the minute especially
for just like day-to-day because they're
so completely
what c'mon and it's a full outfit and
then for like wintertime you can just
lay them with like really big coats and
like lace-up sandals or boots or
anything like that and they just look
really lovely so these ones are like
Jersey and sort of like ribbed material
it's got a low neck as you can see it's
sort of like a v-neck this is the cocky
one they also do it in black and camel
which I have all three I know I have
issues this cocky color I actually
really like this color on myself I feel
like it really suits brunettes not that
it doesn't suit blonds but whenever I
wear this color I got a lot of
compliments on it yeah it's just like a
body con jumpsuit it's got em
three-quarter or like just above the
knee what he's called like sleeves
oh yeah it's like three-quarter length
so like just above the knee I'll
obviously try it on for ya and yeah it's
just body con it just looks so good and
so comfy on the model these are fairly
affordable I'm pretty sure they were
like not twelve pounds you're like
fifteen pounds or so obviously it'll be
linked down below and I got them in an
eight and I'm just obsessed like you
look so good on the model looks so comfy
at the same time and we all know I'm all
about my comfort so that is the cocky
one and then as I said I got it in black
as well because I wear black 24/7 it's
my favorite color this is just the exact
same but in black and it's just got a
low neck I just really like to wear this
and then to pair it with um so like a
really big like trench coat or really
big like furry coat or something like
that and then a little boost or
something I just think it looks so cute
and and they feel nice and stretchy and
nice and comfy and I'm in love so that
is the black bomb under the stuff that
they very kindly sent over the first
thing is a miniskirt because I've
struggled to find like decent miniskirts
this year I ordered some from na Cady
and they were like massive on me and so
they had to go back and I just not found
any that I like since but I saw this one
on the website and I fell in love so
this is just a black a line skirt so it
goes a little bit tighter at the waist
and then it sort of like comes out in
the shape of an a this one is like a
black suede as you can see and it feels
so like luxurious and soft and thick and
then it's got sort of like lace tops
down each
and then it's got like the sort of Lisa
bits at the bottom did I explain that
very well probably not but they just
looked amazing on the model again
because it's quite thick I feel like it
could definitely like work for
autumn/winter time I imagine this with
over-the-knee boots and like a crop top
and a big coat and just something like
quite cosy so be like even though it is
getting colder you can still definitely
wear stuff like this and just like wrap
up and but I love it I love it so so
much I'm hoping and praying that it fits
right I've not tried any of this stuff
on it yeah and but I think about it as
Han yeah I got it in a pan and it's just
nice and thick and cozy and I love it
okay next thing is a pair of shoes and I
have actually already tried these on
because the minute they came I just
wanted to put them on my feet and see if
they fit so they look like this these
types of shoes have been so in style at
the minute they basically got like a
clear heel and clear straps and whatnot
these in the nude version and then they
also do a black version as well and as I
said I have tried these on I got a size
5 because I read on the like I read the
reviews on the website because if you
didn't know misguided has reviews on my
clothes now and everyone was saying that
they looked really good but strap to a
way to tighten because I have wide feet
as it is and usually for bottles I'll
get 5 just in case they are still really
quite tight on me and the strap of the
back is absolutely fine but it's the
strap at the front here like my little
toes are getting squished when I put
these on like I can get them on and they
look okay but you can sort of tell that
they look a little bit swish
I guess it's a shame because I
absolutely love these like it looks so
nice on and obviously because they're
just really minimal I did go into
anything and they're very comfy as well
because obviously got like such a thick
he also if you've got like really skinny
feet all right really thin feet and I
feel like these would be amazing on your
but for people like myself you're on
wide feet maybe not guys look at this
like I wish you could feel it because
it's so soft so this is like a coat
slash hoody slash zip up jacket and I'm
a logger it's just got a zip up the
middle it's like I say it's a jacket
obviously you need to be careful like I
wouldn't wear this out if it was raining
and because it's like completely fair
lined
so soft yeah I'm gonna wear this out if
it was raining it only wear it on a
clear day what I am in love like I just
want to wear this so that I can go
around and hug people and just give them
the best hugs ever because it's so soft
it is line inside like normal jacket
material that makes sense I got it in a
and it's got a hood as well like oh my
gosh I can just imagine this I'm wearing
this and just being so snug and yeah I
did wear it to get I did I did get it to
wear it out and about with like leggings
and whatnot just to be really cozy and
comfy and it looked click on the model
they styled it with like an all-black
outfit and she had like space buns and
stuffing and it was look so cool so I
fell in love and it's just like the
coziest thing ever
and if you think everyone needs one of
these in their life and then next up is
another jumpsuit although this is like a
quite a dressy jumpsuit and again it's
in this sort of like teal khaki color
because I love this color for autumn and
winter and never usually wear it in the
summer because it is quite dark but I
just love it for like winter time so
it's got a v-neck again it's a sort of
like I don't really know how to explain
material it's very thick it feels really
good quality and it's like for me
kind of yeah it's got a v-neck and it's
got a zit at the back and then it just
goes into really long wide leg trousers
as you can see here again it looked so
stunning on the model I love wide leg
trousers because it's like if you like
they just make your legs look so good
and I just feel like oh yeah I just feel
like they make you figure look really
lovely I just am wanting something like
this for evenings and like nights out
and stuff when I want to feel like super
glam just the power with a like pair of
black heels or some lace-up sandals or
something like that just for like a
really elegant and classy outfit because
it looked so like beautiful and classy
on the model and as I said it feels
really thick and really good-quality so
again perfect for winter time because it
will keep those legs warm next up we've
just got a pair of black skinny jeans I
do already have a pair of new jeans from
and misguided I actually bought them on
an egg sauce I'm pretty sure they're
called like vice style yeah vice
high-waisted and skinny
jeans I like the buy spit I feel like
the nice and stretchy so they like hug
your figure nicely and but they don't
feel like too tight because I can't deal
with jeans that feel like too tight on
your body these are just all black with
a rip in the knee because it's been so
long since I had like ripped knee jeans
and I used to love them and wear them
all the time so yeah I just wanted a
plain black pair from what I remember
these were really affordable as well I'm
pretty sure they're like you'd be like
not 15 pounds surely I don't know I'll
link it down below but they were like
cheaper than the other jeans for some
reason but I love this style it's sort
of like jeggings so they've got a nice
bit of stretch to them and and I love
how wasted because I feel like they make
me figure out look oh then I got a pair
of the same like vais jeans but these
are like a sort of whitish like
champagne color just because I don't
have anything like this in my wardrobe
if I wear trousers like I'll usually
wear um black leggings or black jeans
but my other pair of jeans from
misguided are like a really nice sort of
Marlboros McPike color and they look
really good we like the right tops and
whatnot these are sort of like coated
though I didn't expect them to come
kosis yo since they coasted skinny jeans
so they kind of like if you know what
coated jeans are the sort of like slippy
and they feel a bit like leathery oh
yeah they look really cool I feel like
just do with the white top and like a
denim jacket or not done in jacket like
a leather jacket or something I'll be
interested to see what they like on
because I've struggled to get my legs
into coated jeans for some reason
because they've got got so much stretch
but we Sheffey I love them okay next up
we have another jacket I got quite a few
jackets in this haul um yeah I got quite
a few jackets but this is a khaki color
again as I said I love wearing khaki in
autumn winter and they also have this in
a blackish color which is at the bottom
of the bag which I'll show you in a
minute
so it's fur lined as you can see it's
got like a black fur collar if I ever
get a fur collar which I really like
faux collars on jackets I just said fur
collar so many times if I ever get
something with a fur collar I always
like to make sure it's black because
obviously a lot of makeup and I would
just ruin a white one and so this has
got a black fur collar and it's
I'm pretty sure it's not like visits
here yeah it's got like black fur inside
this had really good reviews on the
website I'm just saying that it was
really comfy really cozy install but
it's got like and package to the bata
pockets at the bottom there cameras just
caught out because I've clearly been
speaking for far too long
yeah just report with um all-black
outfits and white trainers and stuff
like I said I love khaki and I love fair
line coats so it's a match made in
heaven next up is a car key dress this
is a body con it like sort of boob tube
strapless dress it just looks like so
it's got no sleeves and no straps
anything like that it just cuts across
your boobies like so and then it's body
con and it just goes down into a sort of
like MIDI below the knee and dress it
looked incredible on the model obviously
I'm gonna have to try it on and see if
it looks anywhere near as good on me and
love of basic pieces like this to layer
so to put we like a really big trench
coat and all I can really big fercho and
a pair of heels for a night owl or for
like I don't know a really fancy meal or
something like that
I just love things like this it looked
really comfy because it's like sort of
it's not Jersey material but it's got
like a nice a bit of stretch to it and
whatnot and it's like a ribbed material
if you can kind of see and it just looks
like it's shaped really well for the
figure so yeah it makes like to try that
on and see how it looks okay this is
probably my favorite thing of this whole
so far like oh my gosh I'm obsessed as I
was just saying they have a similar
coats in khaki one but in black and guys
and I love this one because it's like a
soft finish so the other one was like a
sheep II sort of like woolly fair which
I still really like but this one's like
a soft sort of oh my god I wish you
could feel it's like the same materials
like the one that's got it all over like
the black jacket that I showed at the
start oh my god I'm in love again had
amazing reviews on website everyone was
saying how it's like so comfy so cozy
perfect for autumn winter and I got it
in a ten I'm hoping it's not going to be
like too big on the shoulders because
the reason I always struggle to fit
coats is because I like to have them a
little bit big so that I can put a
jumper underneath but I also then sort
like look two bigs um
what they then look too big on the arms
and the shoulders so it's always a bit
of a struggle but yeah I'm hoping this
one's gonna fit really well
I'm obsessed like oh my god I'm gonna
sleep in this every night I just I love
it so much I wish you could just feel
the fair I love I love I love next a lot
of stuff is some pretty little thing and
I think I only got 2 things from what I
remember or maybe just one thing ok so I
got two things the first one is a pair
of leggings and they're sort of like a
cross between leggings and cigarettes
houses because they feel like I'm formal
cigarette trousers and they've got a zip
at the back and but I saw these on line
I've actually been seeing these a lot on
Instagram so lace up leggings at the
side as you can see and I fell in love
with the way they look and I was on the
hunt for some and then I was shopping on
pretty little thing for something else
which I'll show you in a minute
I still these and they have them in this
collab I'm pretty sure they also have
them in black but maybe they were sold
out in black because I would have got
the black and like a really nice sort of
nude color obviously I got cocky so
they're just tapered cigarette trousers
and then they've got lace-ups all down
at the sides of the leg I like these
ones as well because the lace-up doesn't
go right to the top some of them do and
then it's kind of like you can't really
wear underwear because you'd see your
underwear whereas these you can because
it starts like a little bit and
downwards so you could definitely put
like a pair of knickers or a thong on or
whatever you want to wear honey and then
they just go into tapered charges as I
said these just look really sort of edgy
I guess because it's like the normal
trousers but then you tend to the side
outside bow place up well and then the
thing that I actually went online I'm
pretty little thing for this is super
basic but it's just a cropped jumper and
because I bought a lot over charles's
and like Jed's like the Jersey trousers
that I got from pretty little thing I'm
obsessed with it the minute that like
Jersey sort of wide like jogger things
but they just look really nice in the so
comfy and because I high-waisted I want
something cropped and loose to go with
them so this is just a cropped and like
loose fitted jumper it's got like a sort
of rough like distress hem which I
really liked and then it just goes in to
long sleeves that I coughed this for me
is a staple
I had one like ages ago that was white
but I was on a month one that was black
for ages and
some reason I just can't find one
anywhere and but yeah I love this just
to go with like stuff that's
high-waisted that you kind of want the
waist to be seen but then you also want
something like loose on top I love this
and I think it was only about 12 or 15
pounds or so so obsessed and then I've
got two things here from an Australian
brand called assisters a label they are
sort of like designer like the spoke
label I would say and I love this
company I love the people who work there
they are so so kind and and just so
lovely and they make the most beautiful
like dresses and play suits and skirts
and to pieces and what nights or like
how made and hand-stitched and it's
absolutely stunning this one that
they've sent over the first one is a
nude place too as you can see like you
can see the silk it's just so stunning
got elastic waist the stuff that they
make is pretty much one size I think so
it sort of fits all and it's got an
elastic waist and then it just goes into
little let's look shorts and then you
sort of do it up as a halter neck at the
back I am so in love with this like it
feels so soft and luxurious like it just
feels beautiful I'll link the website
and obviously these pieces down below
and there's a separate piece that is
sort of a bow I'm pretty sure so you can
sort like hey around the waist and style
it how you want that's what I like about
a lot of their stuff you can really
style it to the way you want it to look
so this is a maxi dress it's going to be
really hard to show but obviously I'll
try it on I've been in love with this
piece for so long because it looks so
stunning and on the website and like on
the module it's just a maxi dress and
then it's got a similar style where it
just sort of ties around the back and
then it's also got a separate piece
again which you can just sort of like
style how you wish I just love this like
it's so pretty and elegant and so like
simple at the same time like just to go
with a pair of like black heels if or if
you had an LaBute ons how perfect with
that but you can't explain how much I
love that stuff is really simple pieces
but they're just so well made and like
crafted and then just like designed and
whatnot and I just really love like the
work that goes into what they do so I'll
put a link limit down below obviously
I'll try this stuff on as well like I
said the embellished pieces aren't like
they're insane so if you're looking for
something for say prom or your birthday
and you want like a really fancy
dress or like two-piece or whatnot like
I can't recommend them enough that is
100% where I would go and but yeah I
love them they're so luxurious obsessed
thank you so much - Bridget new people
at sisters and then the very last thing
I got was trauma bershka I was in London
it from Monday to wednesday of this week
and me and Rachel went shopping on the
Wednesday because um you know shopping
we stopped in Bershka because I
obviously don't have a best fit in
Manchester um and these puffer coats I
have been wanting one for so long my
friend Millie got red one and she looks
insane annette rachel also got the red
one because i feel like red really suits
blonds and I just wanted the black one
because obviously you know you know make
these a perfect for winter time because
they're so frigging warm like they're
just messy the coats
I actually got mine in a large I did one
in a medium but didn't have a medium so
just started for the lodge because I
drove up to big the thing that I love
about them though is that let they are
crap so even though they're very padded
they don't look too much because their
crops they sort of finished like just
above your waist or above your head so
whatnot and I want this out last night I
went to cinema with Isla and it kept me
so warm like it's just friggin massive
like look at it it just it takes off my
whole upper body and I love it but
they're only affordable as well there's
39 pounds I believe and they do it in
this color which is black and then they
also do it in a reg and away I kind of
want away I'm trying not to buy it but
it's probably not going to work out so

want one for yourself so that is
