to be a little haul what is new I know
what you thinking Hannah you have done
so many holes recently I know I can't
stop shopping I don't know what it is so
I wanted to mix this one up a little bit
everything that I bought is still myself
of course buying presents for me but
they all in my opinion make really cool
gifts as well so if you're still
Christmas shopping like I know a lot of
people are and these are things that
kind of make really cool last-minute
gifts from like online retailers and
things like that they're all pretty
affordable as well some of them anyway
so rather than doing it in the order of
the retailer I'm gonna do it an order of
like category so we're gonna start with
jewelry and then do like little mini
gifts like candles and socks and stuff
like that and then do clothes and shoes
at the end so these hoops are the first
thing that I picked up these are from
pretty little thing everything will be
linked down below of course so these are
quite similar to the ones that I bought
from fashion nobre because I always get
so many compliments from you guys on the
hoops that I got from fashion Noba which
I wear in quite a lot of videos I wore
them to my like Christmas party as well
before they fell out and broke but I
wanted to pick some ups that are similar
from like a UK retailer so that you guys
can get your hands on them a little bit
easier this one is so sore like it took
me ages to get the scoop in and now my
areas like really stinking so yeah these
are kind of similar they're basically
like large gold hoops as you can see and
they're kind of textured rather than
just like a like a simple hoop
if you're not I mean but yeah I love
these kind of hoops at the mirror I feel
like they just add a little bit more to
the look rather than just being basic
hoops and these are pretty cheap from
pretty little thing I feel like they're
about 5 or 8 pounds as I said everything
will be in the description bar and but I
love them like I just love I'm obsessed
with gold hoops at the minute I don't
know what it is but I just can't stop
wearing them so things like this I think
make a really cool little gift for
people and then I also picked up some
necklaces which again are for moi and
they're basically two little chokers
that come in a set it's gonna be really
hard to show so I'm gonna insert a photo
of what they look like on the website
here and first of all they can't like I
said as a two set so you got two chokers
in one which i think is really cool I'm
pretty sure they're only about five
pounds as well for both of them and one
of them has a moon on it and the other
one has the star so you know I had to
get the moon love you to the moon and
back you know is and they are gold
because I've just been obsessed with
like gold jewellery recently I don't
know
what it is I said that really weird
jewelry yeah you can see what they look
like that they actually have little and
diamond tees anyway like the style one
has a little kind of like silver jewel
in the middle I'm trying to like there
you go you can kind of see that and
they're adjustable as well which is
obviously really handy so you can decide
how tight you want it on the neck but
again at things like this make really
good stocking fillers if you're doing
like a stock in for a sister or anyone
or just little gifts to put in a gift
bag for like friends and things because
I don't know about anyone else but I
love getting people lots of little
things rather than like one really big
things and they've got lots of stuff to
open and use so yeah last one I picked
up is from it misguided this is a little
bit different for me and it's basically
a really long necklace again don't mind
me again a loose set a photo here of
what it looks like on the model and it's
kind of like a long chain so it's more
for like plunge tops and stuff like that
and this for me is something that I'd
wear on a night out with like a low-cut
dress or something like that it's just
really simple because again I think
jewelry that's quite like a mini more
and dainty it looks quite cute it's just
got the two gold chains and then just
like this kind of circle and the little
drop in the middle and again it's all
adjustable and stuff at the back which
is really cool this was again five
pounds so absolute bargain okay under
some bits that I picked up at mystic I
did first of all these socks I saw them
on the website and I'm absolutely
obsessed because I love cozy socks at
wintertime like fluffy socks that you
can wear around the house I've currently
got on PJ buttons and like puddle vest
hogs with my Christmas jumper you can't
really see I'm kind of sad that you
can't see this more but you know it's
what it is yeah comfy socks is something
that I'm obsessed with and again they
make such good gifts because who doesn't
need socks
everyone needs socks everyone loves
socks like I just think they're such a
lovely gift and you got all like the
Christmas edition ones and stuff at
Christmastime of course and so the box
is a little bit damaged for these ones
which is kind of annoying but I did get
two pairs and these ones are fine I love
that they come in the box because I feel
like it's easy to like wrap it and make
it into a cool gift okay so I can't from
how much these were I feel like they
were like seven pounds each maybe which
like the box and stuff is pretty good
yeah these are the reindeer ones super
soft super cozy they just got a little
love Rudolph
on and then they're just stripy and
things like that and then the blue ones
have snowmen on so yeah we've got some
blue ones with a snowman on and then
some red ones with reindeers on and I
just love things like this I've always
asked for socks at Christmas always ask
for them in my stuck in and things like
that and again they make really cool and
like easy gifts to buy because you know
that someone's gonna look sucks you know
I mean then again something that is on
it misguided at the minute which I am in
love with misguided and pretty little
thing and like a sauce and stuff have a
really cool a gift shop so obviously
they mostly like clothes and retailers
and things and but they've got really
cool like Christmas shops as a minute
like on the website under like the top
one thing that misguided are selling are
candles I love a good sense it kind of
I've not actually smelt this one yeah
so on the front it says not your honey
the actual container for the candle is
really cute like this is a sort of thing
where I'd burn it and then scrape it all
out and use the jar for something else
because I feel like it looks really cool
whoo oh my gosh okay so it smells
exactly like if you've ever had the lush
bath bomb that you can get at
Christmastime there's a pink
it's a pink bubble bar and it's called
candy mountain and it's pink and white
spiral all the way into this little cone
it smells exactly like that and I'm
obsessed with that I think it's a bubble
bar it literally smells exactly like
that so I'm already obsessed this was
ten pounds I'm pretty sure which for a
scented candle is really good given the
size as well because I know for a fact
that like I buy my mom candles and stuff
at Christmas and if you got them from
Alton Brown or Jo Malone or wherever
they are pretty expensive so if you'd
like 10 pounds push plus student
discount is a really good price for that
and it smells bloody yummy it's very
sweet but very yummy
okay then I'm totally these aren't
misguided and I fell in love and these
are slippers again everyone needs a pair
of slippers the reason I picked these
ones up because they look a little bit
crazy they're basically sliders that
have pom-poms on again I'll insert a
photo of what they look like here and I
love wearing sliders around the house so
I have it sliders like my fancy pin ones
that I always wear like obviously
outside and stuff and I got into the
habit of wearing them inside because I
don't have a good pair of slippers but
at the same time I'm really fussy with
slippers I don't like anything that
covers your whole thought if that makes
sense so I saw these and I thought
they'd be perfect because they literally
just slide your slipper it's really soft
and furry and they've got the little
pom-poms on and stuff again I'm pretty
sure these were around ten pounds or so
which is a pretty good price for
slippers there might be a 15 actually
they do them in gray as well and but I'm
just obsessed with them I feel like
that's so cute perfect for just around
the house and things like that and again
a very affordable gift great on to shoes
I picked out some shoes from a sauce
because I loved it getting shoes done a
sauce they have it so many different
brands and stuff as you guys will know
obviously in terms of like trainers and
shoes these are the sorts of things
where if you want to spend a little bit
more money on stuff and you could get
something like this I know for a fact
that my brother Charlie and my boyfriend
Kayne love shoes so this is definitely
obviously not these specific shoes
because these are like your shoes just
what traders and stuff are a really good
gift at Christmas I feel like especially
if you got a pair that aren't like super
expensive
oh I've picked out a pair of trainers
from ASOS I needed new trainers anyway
and again at these are just an example
of something that you could get for you
mom or sister or friend as I've said
though as you can see these are from
adidas or adidas honestly there's always
such a debate in my comments as to
whether it's adidas or a DDoS I say a
deed it's number one sense I say it
wrong but you know it is what it is okay
so this is what they look like what they
called that the adidas Swift Run women's
I got these in a size 5 my trainers I
always get them either white or nude
like I never really got black trainers
or anything like that I just love the
look of nude and white trainers so hence
why I picked these owl I'm pretty sure
these are about 70 pounds which in my
opinion isn't like a crazy amount for
trainers there's some trainers on the
market which like up to 200 pounds so I
feel like these are pretty reasonable
and again you can get something off of
course with student discount and stuff
like that and but I'm just obsessed with
them so they're just kind of like basic
trainers as you can see I've not tried
them on yet but I always love adidas
trainers I love the quality and stuff
they always last me a really long time
so I don't mind investing the money in
them I feel like they just look really
cute as well the reason I love white a
new trainers is because they just go
with everything that I wear like jeans
leggings joggers like no matter what I
put on they'll always look good okay so
next time isn't
trainers these are kind of like more
girly shoes I guess because these are my
current favorite part of over the knees
again I always got opening boots from
Asus because they do wide fit opening
boots and my feet are a little bit on
the chilly side okay
so the ones that I picked out this year
are by a brand called lust Inc I've
never had shoes from them before but I
saw them on the website and just fell in
love these are actually what I wore to
my Christmas party if anyone is
wondering so the thing that I love about
them first of all they weren't crazy
expensive I'm pretty sure they were like
60 pounds I can't quite remember that's
such good quality so I don't know if you
can see but they are like a velvet
material which I've never had for an
opening boot before and the heel isn't
it crazy tall because I did want them to
be more of like a daytime boot they're
not going out boot because wearing
velvet like on a night out and having
drinks Vilonia is just not the way to go
and so they've got a slightly smaller
heel and I wore these for what like five
hours six hours maybe on the day of my
Christmas party my feet never got saw
stood up all day they were so
comfortable yeah they're just an
absolute staple they go with everything
like I wore them with a shirt dress you
can wear them with jeans you can wear
them on nice out like I said it's not
the best idea if they're velvet like
these but I do have another part that I
wear on nights out they're just such a
good a staple and because they're so
basic as well with them just being a
plain black obviously you can get
different colors but if you're buying a
gift like plain black over the knee
boots is always a winner in my eyes
because we just go with everything
okay on to the last bits which I just
closed and stuff like that so I got a
couple of things from misguided and a
couple of things from pretty little
things so I picked out some lingerie
from this guy dear because again if you
have a sister or a friend or anyone who
likes lingerie it's always a good and
easy gift so I picked out a few things
that were red because again lingerie and
red lingerie doesn't get much more
Christmassy than that in terms of gifts
so the first one is just a body because
this looked absolutely stunning on the
model like I was just like yes please so
it's just a right body and it's got all
kind of like gold detail and like lace
kind of all over the chest section
unlike the torso section I guess and
then it's just kind of like a sheer mesh
material
at the bottom it's got this kind of
lace-up as you can see down at the
center where your little boobs are and
then it's got the same at the back as
well I've not tried it on yeah I got a
size a I'm hoping that it fits me really
well because I've needed like new good
lingerie for ages and then I picked up a
kind of like it's like a brawler and
song set so this I had to get in a size
tanks it was sold out in an a they do
this in a couple of different colors so
this is obviously long so again it's
just red lace so the phone is obviously
pretty basic it just is what it is it's
got like gold rings and stuff as part of
the sides does that make sense I don't
know but that is kind of like a close-up
she's got lace all over the front and
then in terms of the brawler it
basically has it's basically one of
those pilots where it's got like the
area that covers at your breasts and
then it's got a strap here so it has
like a little bits of detail on it so
yeah this is the broiler
as you can see it's got the two straps
there so it's all kind of lace it's
quite share so something to my mind but
again it's got all like the gold rings
and things like that and it's fully
adjustable which I love and it's also
got a like a strap around the bottom
which goes underneath the whole bra so
it's quite like pretty and dainty and
it's got a lot of detail to it which I
really like and again because it's from
like misguided it's super affordable and
then the very last thing that I've
picked up are just some bits of clothing
I'm not gonna try them on just because I
feel like this whole video it's just
been kind of like gift guys and a bit of
a all over the place thing and I'm
filming this on a Thursday and he's
uploaded on a Thursday so I don't have
time I hope you don't mind but there's
only a couple of pieces the first thing
I have actually tried on in a past video
anyway so you already know what this
looks like on me got three things to
show you I think yes we've got three
items of clothing
this one is one pretty little thing and
then the other two I misguided and
they're all quite basic things because
if I'm gonna buy clothes for someone
else like I'll either buy something that
I know they're definitely gonna love it
if it's quite detailed or I'll just grab
something super basic because basic
things just go with everything and again
it's kind of like there's there'd be no
reason for them not to like if you know
I mean like I'd rather get them
something kind of plain and basic than
something really over-the-top but they
might not like if that makes sense so
the first thing is just a cropped
sweater this is rad again super
Christmassy and
this and white from pretty little thing
which is what I said at what I searched
which is what I tried on in my last
whole I think it was my Cyber Monday
haul it was like a white cropped jumper
the exact same thing but just in a
different color I got these in a medium
because the crop is quite sure we'll
just warn you of that now and then it
just has that long sleeves with the
cuffs at the bottom I wear my white one
all the time now I'm absolutely obsessed
with it the crop is a little bit short
so sometimes I just kind of layer it and
make it look a little bit edgy and stuff
with like um new tops and stuff
underneath but they are so cozy it's so
comfy but yeah I just love the color
I've been really getting into red
clothing and things recently so when I
saw this on the website I was like I
need it cuz I already knew how much I
loved the white one and then last two
things are from misguided so the first
thing I picked out was a roll neck top
because I feel like roll necks are
really appropriate for winter I've kind
of got like a high neck on at the minute
at this again by the way is from my sky
did this like questions treetop I'm
pretty sure it sold out but I'll leave a
link to it down below if I can so yeah
this is just a white ribbed roll neck I
have a similar one from another website
in kind of like a bluey gray which I
absolutely love and live in and so I saw
this white one again it's cropped and
things because I like to wear them with
like high-waisted jeans and stuff and
I'm just obsessed I'm the only thing I'm
like slightly bothered about is because
it's white and I were fete time and
stuff with it being a high-neck I'm just
hoping that I'm not gonna go to
absolutely filthy which I probably will
because you know that's the issue with
white and tan well I love the style of
it is really thick material and
considering its from misguided again
it's pretty affordable and then the very
last thing I picked up from misguided I
kind of had in mind to pair these two
together and so these are some joggers
and you guys know that they're kind of
like the style of joggers that I always
buy from this guide in which have the
stripes down the side and then like the
elasticated waist band news from this
guy did I'm obsessed with that the
quality is really really good for the
price I'm pretty sure they're only like
18 pounds or so and again it'd make a
really good gift because they can just
be paired with anything like body suits
crop jumpers t-shirts like whatever you
want to wear them where the trainers
whatever they just look
but they're really comfy really thick
and I've had my black ones with the
white stripe for ages now I took them to
New York they were pretty much all I
wore and I just love them and so these
are Navy I don't know if you can see
they kind of look black on camera and
put that Navy and then because of the
red stripe I had in mind to sort of pair
them with the red jumper I just thought
it'd make a really cute outfit for
wintertime and so that is the last thing
that I picked out in terms of
clotheslines I'm sorry that I didn't try
those three items on I feel like you
guys have seen me wear some other things
though so you kind of know what the fit
is and you know that the quality is
there well I know that the qualities
that are new except had its similar
things before but that is pretty much
everything for this haul so I really
hope you guys enjoyed this video let me
know in the comments what you're getting
for people for Christmas because I would
love to know I've pretty much just
finished Christmas shopping for people
now which is like so such a good thing
to know I feel so much more of a person
other bits don't I've just got a wrap
everything which will take me a hot
second but we fine I hope you're all
excited for Christmas it's only a couple
of days away now I cannot believe it and
I hope you all enjoyed yesterday's video
the hood of beauty testing I have to say
I do actually have the hood of beauty
foundation on today again I wanted to
test it out and stuff with the primer so
far looks absolutely flawless and job
I've decided I don't like the brush the
brush isn't for me but the foundation
the primer look absolutely and out turn
so I hope you all enjoyed that video um
I'm going out soon I'm going away with
cane as I mentioned in yesterday's video
and I'm really excited so yeah I'm gonna
get going and edit this video thank you
so much for watching I feel like I've
just run water for ages I love you to
the moon Oh buck as always and I will
see you in Sunday's video fingers
crossed
