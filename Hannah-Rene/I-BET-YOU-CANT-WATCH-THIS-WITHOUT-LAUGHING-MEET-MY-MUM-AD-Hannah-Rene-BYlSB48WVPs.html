a real special gasps oh my god this
really old fall oh shit I look atrocious
now it's own fault
are we ready do the reading yeah hey
guys it's hands
so today I am joined with a really
special guest about everyone moans I've
actually been on my channel below for
very good reasons or very good reason
ahead and you've all that Charlie of
course and I mean I feel like you
sometimes active and around on social
media especially since red stuff where
did I stop yeah she just like to say I
love you but you know so we've actually
teased up with a buddy shot for this
video which is will excite
because me and mom adore the body shop
so much don'twe I love the pocket
channel in love the body shot was a
partition are exactly so they very
kindly sent over at their mother's day
gift set which they have launched this
coming Mother's Day which is about a
week on something I've met we constantly
are we going to be a week away when you
are there yeah this is the gift that
light is out for people to get by
mothers grandmothers sisters aunts or
just yourself if you want yourself
because I'm not at the workout so it's
got a pink evening jack and then a pink
rose as well as it's perfect for moms
because yeah a little bit pink and then
you open it up inside and this is what
it looks like on the inside you already
opened it without me know you also do
really I shall not say so yeah the body
water of course is to apply all of you
but as like a lovely hydration cream and
at this one it says it's for normal to
dry skin and it comes with an essence of
hand-picked rodents from Britain which
is your facial yeah so everything is
rose scented in this collection as well
which personally I'm not all our mouths
for me yeah you love it I'm not always
like the biggest fun of Bro sense but
it's not like too heavy and it's so less
large really don't care and just Laurel
and perceive also got the exfoliating
body scrub which is probably one of my
favorites and just because of the our
stuff like caked on and some body scrubs
to me are really good and by feeling
everyone Muslim because either way like
it still goes to the 6l80 skin
yeah and sharing the bath and I'm going
to be much happy
yeah beyond that a favorite within it
it's the press of soft hand cream we do
not love a good use of the time on the
other hand cream because I feel like out
of every way you can sometimes get when
I don't yeah yeah so yeah we've got the
hand cream at the body butter and it'd
be sort of exfoliating shower gel and
then we've also got a normal shower gel
as well as she's going to shoot in fact
the shower when you washing your body
again I love how cute is it something
you know so dig dus it's really nice so
I can keep yeah I mean we'll share look
I'm not beautiful she'll have to come
home then I don't know it's funny come
on I mean I've I just sneak even I draw
before me but you know
no need to Nirvana so like everything in
the gifts that there will be a recon
globe and almost to get from cells of
the mums with vampires and others as I
said I feel like it should such a good
gets perfect in general yeah exactly as
this video is in collaboration with of
Aisha they've given us the challenge of
me and mum to basically come up with a
bunch of reasons as to why mum it's just
the coolest thing on the planet
oh girl so we've basically come up with
a bunch of things that I and as well new
as well as well so we thought we
basically capture your smooth things
that makes mom so fasting in to time
Mother's Day with the body shop and and
of course you got to know a little bit
more about the mom because like even
though you've met Charlie you've never
really had a chat with my mum up there
so yeah so the better product we were
talking about is the fact that in the
past maybe not so much anymore because
you're a very busy woman looking after
me and Charlie went on like 19 and
basically at all and we're in the normal
crafts to do yes exactly
in the past most of lots of spontaneous
and brave things I would say oh yeah a
few
oh you so we thought we'd cut about some
so that you can get an insight of some
of the stuff she's been up to so much
and Italy first because when you are all
going yeah that's because I was talking
about what I was doing when I was your
age yeah so and did I go straight to uni
after school and no I didn't and I went
to Italy free and you actually go to the
work of the money
new to children so that was pretty crazy
it has and it's hard to have that
responsibility of looking after someone
else's children about yeah it's very
scary so you know I can't speak Italian
accounts with the language fortunately
all the family know that could speak
mate in English and apart for the
children but they were wanted to
understand the world the next one we
were talking about is the fact that mom
this is one of my favorite thing my mom
she's so hard-working learn strong and
independent business lady
Oh My yes example well mean this was
like just when our designing she was
ready we fight when when you suck so
talk about when we use our yeah we're
yet yet when you three charming response
yes when you have my setup a business
yeah yeah so because I used to work I
did go back to work after you were born
well I only went back full-time for two
weeks when your first bomb because I
have to pack my shopping because I
couldn't leave her I couldn't leave that
was really difficult so but no I
continued working but I work from home
and I did freelance work and so I could
stay at home with you as well but then
obviously I got a job went back to work
properly when you were little and but
yes me and you dev unfortunately first
last four jobs together so what do you
do to start a business
okay how crazy and then how long has it
been our 15 years 15 years 15 basically
and still going strong the close CNN
about star brilliant brilliant client we
are actually super super lucky really
yeah which I mean it yeah that sums my
favorite thing about you that's
something I always bragged about it when
it now but you know when you're younger
yep pirates one has good stuff and you
talk about what you want me guys doing
on my final Madonna oh cool
really yeah could be like her own
business and all of your hard and every
year well I know but it's hard work
alone yeah but you know mr. Walden yeah
I'm not getting awarded up so yeah one
of the things that makes you so cool
thank you another thing that I think
makes me really cool is the fact that
she's always doing stuff for other
people so for example you always make
lots of effort to like me and Charlie on
like our bed oh yeah so talking about
before when I was like 8 or so my oh
yeah didn't again when we I did a
surprise trip yeah took you to
Disneyland I woke you up in the middle
of the night and Charlie I went with dad
a mariner and grandpa and uncle
something we always but you didn't know
where I was going and it's a total
surprise and then we managed to get you
to Euro Disney without you actually
knowing and there
you're there in your bowel princess out
there she's my favorite princess
celebrating your birthday with a salon
just me mostly past the experience yet
my 18th birthday as well that's actually
a welcome my second violin right that
was like what they call it birthday
together and that we cried a lot
yeah we cried so much we always cry we
always cry I don't cry another thing
that I was saying that I think makes mom
super cool and it's not about cool be
cool the fact that you've always been so
supportive when we do need you coming
here yeah I feel like when YouTube
really started taking off me with like a
bit of a weird time because it was like
when I just finished a levels and
originally I was gonna go to university
and surf ordinarily like extreme things
like that and then I decided that I
wanted to do a bit of a gap year and
trying to YouTube and like I would also
with it myself for a certain time so
yeah yeah I have a job but I wanted to
like put as much time in Gigi Bella
College and I felt like you were suppose
that when you were at sharp background
to unit so it wouldn't so much point
going exactly unless you know you really
really wanted to go know you wanted to
try something different so as far as I
was concerned as long as you were
working and you were happy and you are
doing something that you actually enjoy
well that's the main thing of cement you
know it's um it could be hard enough
work in anyway you've got to do
something that you definitely I'm really
enjoying that you love from everything
so and I think that's what you do that's
another thing like you always tell me
Anya as long as you're happy that's all
that matters well it is solving my
harmonious organized happy and healthy
yeah feel like something that we share
in common and that I've probably got
from long as the fact that were both
very family orientated only oh we love
spending time with films yeah I feel
like we have quite a big family we've
got a blue sailor and your
like your phone sisters on line out to
uncle's grandparents then everyone's dad
side as well like and then obviously
nieces and nephews and stuff
yes of course and what we like spend
lots of time and money don't we we do
yeah what could a marketing exactly and
I end with these two crazy crazy yeah I
get that from you as well yeah craziness
I don't know yeah even worse is that
that's like how long we don't know new
ways this yeah I just don't like it
versus always meant and secretly hope he
does not doing much feel like I I have a
lot of my favorite things because as one
like I have my love for cats because oh
yeah captain bridge yeah yeah yeah
definitely because I look at cynical you
know anyone who knows me knows a look at
much definitely from mom and higher
crunching phrase yeah and my love for
things like candles camera and I love
smell anything yeah even like body parts
and things like anything that smell oh
yeah yeah like that my year and that's
confirm you yes my stuff for the bus
yeah like probably like a cozy home like
yeah my love for like home decor if you
like Emily experiment is so another
thing that the body shop are doing for
this was to a Mother's Day campaign
they've actually got a conversation
going on on Twitter at minute where you
can post a picture of you and your mom
or you and your grandma or you and the
woman or the person in your life I guess
and inspires you and for me obviously is
you oh yeah so you can basically share a
throwback picture of you and your mom or
you and whoever and use the hashtags got
it from her and and basically put in the
caption as well on Twitter or increase
sorry a little sentence or a little
thing about how a person has inspired
you and what you love about them and
what makes them a really cool person and
there's some prizes to be won which is
really cool a bunch of gifts that boxes
that going out to some winners so if you
win some of you will win this and which
is the road sort of hamper that we've
shown you is there for products and
there is a 200-pound hamper which
really cool because you get 200 pounds
worth of the body shop products and then
there is to 100 pounds hundreds as well
so basically three people have the
chance to win a big products humper and
then there's also a bunch of these gift
sets as well which again equally cool so
we thought we would show you quickly
some photos of odd to give you some
samples of the bench mat on a shower
with your photo she felt it is my
favorite one
okay yeah this was I know this is a
question picture of creme over the first
moment yeah so which I do look very very
little object and I needed crying when
I'm out yeah because I would say I mean
our older maintenance must have your
about trick so I do mill in some way
melted and that was your first proper
smell actually down at Nana grandpa yeah
and we I love when Anakin Pollux in
within this question because legend yeah
it was business so much like consumer
feels yeah so do you it's so short don't
see if it looks to be arms and like and
but I was my favorite is my hand it was
a funny one could this was me workings
