you're having a lovely we so today's
video is gonna be another clothing video
I actually planned to do this video
quite a few weeks ago but I just never
got around to it and you don't filming
other stuff but I've had these clothes
and this like older for quite a few
weeks now so I basically place an order
on she in I think that's how you
pronounce it so I placed it around the
same time that I placed my duffle order
and I'm pretty sure that owned by the
same people I'm sure someone sent in my
sample video that likes Apple and she in
and stuff like owned by the same company
a website and the whole shopping
experience I did found was very similar
to shuffle as well if you've not seen my
sample video and you would like to I'll
leave it on the screen here but yeah
these close-up look she's just been
sitting in my room waiting to be tried
on and filmed with so I'm really excited
to do this because you all seem to
really enjoy these awful one I did in
terms of delivery and stuff the delivery
was pretty quick it actually came
quicker than my saffle ordered yet I
think there was custom fees I can't
remember because the thing is like I
placed a few orders at the same time
that were like international orders so I
got a few question for you through but I
don't exactly know what for haul which
is really annoying but I'm pretty sure
this did have custom fees because I know
there's a full one did as well which was
super annoying I'm just gonna hop
straight in so this first thing I
absolutely love like I am so excited to
take this on holiday I've booked a
holiday okay me and Ken are going to
Santorini in May I want to say and I'm
so excited so you know already prepping
for the holiday clothes you know how it
is so this is basically a jumpsuit
jumpsuit it's always so hard to show on
camera I don't even know I bother
holding them up but it's basically it
just kind of like a plunge situation on
the top half so it's kind of all like
mustard with navy and white and red
stripes the whole collar vibe I
absolutely love basically just a plunge
and then at the back you just tie it up
in a little bow and it's got adjustable
straps you guys know how I feel about
your full straps I love them and then in
terms of their waist like it's just got
a little waist band here and then it
just goes down into wide like trousers I
friggin love this okay I can't remember
how much everything was and they don't
have price tags on but I will leave it
in the description bar below yes I'm
absolutely obsessed with first of all
the material is so soft it's kind of
like on the inside but because it's a
bit of a darker color
I didn't find it to be see-through or
anything like that I just loved the
whole vibe like it looks really
flattering on like I said I love the
colors this is just like a holiday
outfit for me like I can just see this
it's like a holiday kind of vibe so I
got this in a small fit absolutely
perfectly like honestly I love this I am
obsessed okay and then again this is
gonna be really hard to show because not
only is this a jump too but it's also a
multi-way jump to multi way stuff is
like so hard to show on camera because
it's lit she's just like two straps yeah
it's basically like a kind of cream
color it's not like true why it's more
like a cream and then the top half is
like multi way so it kind of just wraps
around your neck and you can style it
how you want which I love multi way
stuff because I feel like it could you
can make it look really flattering on
the issue is okay because it's why slash
cream slash of why it's so see-through
like honestly when I first got out of
the like bag I wasn't too concerned
because the bottom half of the jumpsuit
like the actual trousers and stuff
they're really cute as well they're like
flared at the bottom um and I wasn't too
concerned because it does feel pretty
thick so in my head I was like oh I'll
be fine like it won't be see-through or
anything like that
I had great Calvin Klein's on and oh my
goodness this was so see-through okay
I'm going to do these two together
because I kind of tried them on together
the first thing is just a little white
vest top again I love wearing white and
I love best tops I feel like they're so
versatile you can just pad them with
anything and this is kind of like a
knitting material it's so soft like
honestly is so soft and it's just got
like basic spaghetti straps and it's a
bit of a v-neck and then it's just like
straight at the back and it's kind of
like a cropped vibe this I really like
but you would have to work with a bra
like I tried it on without a bra and it
wasn't okay niffle hides and then I put
a bra on with it and it covered but I
just felt like it ruined the shape of it
a bit this though that I tried it on
where I'm absolutely obsessed began so
this is just a mini skirt and it's kind
of like a Czech tartan
what do you call this print I don't know
check I just love this style of the mini
and I also love the fact that the top of
the skirt is kind of like Rafa Lee
because again I feel like that's really
in
style at the minute and I love the way
it looks on and it's got a little zipper
at the side which helps to get it on and
then it's just got pockets as well and
then it comes with a little belt that
just wraps around so you can kind of
tighten it at the waist if you want to I
love this like it just looked so cute on
I can just imagine it with like a white
like a white top like this or like a
white Rolex half and over the knee boots
I just feel like that would be such a
cute outfit and it's not too short
either that's one thing I will say
because a lot of stuff in my south
alauda was like crazy short and this
wasn't too bad a lot of the stuff
actually wasn't too bad in terms of
length or things that were more of like
a miniskirt or mini dress by okay and
then I got three pinafores because
anyone who's watched my other clothing
hauls will know that I'm really like
into pinafores at the minute I just
think I can they make a really cute
outfit and a really easy outfit because
it's like a jumpsuit you just throw it
on and it's done do you not I mean so I
picked up three on the website so I'll
do this one at first this is just a
black denim pinafore and then it's got a
little white and black striped kind of
straps it's got a little pocket at the
front as well which I thought was really
cute so that is just the whole vibe of
it it's just literally black denim
because I don't own a black pinafore and
you guys know I love a bit of all black
the straps especially I really like
because I liked it the add a little bit
of not really color we're just a bit of
detail rather than it being all black if
that makes sense it's actually got a
pocket on the back as well it fit okay
so I got this again in a small and I
just about got it over my hips because
one thing we've done in pinafores
especially they're obviously a little
bit more stiffer than like a cotton or a
jersey so it just about like just about
it went over my hips and then when he
was on it fitted okay I feel like they
fit okay but I don't know if they look
flattering if that makes sense so I need
you to tell me in the comments and be
honest I do really like it I feel like
it'd look really cool with like a
t-shirt underneath and then a pair of
white trainers like that's kind of what
I've got in mind this one I'm not that
keen on and I like the style of it but I
think it's the color that I'm not like
obsessed with so this one is more of
like a jersey not really Jersey but it's
just more of like a silky material if
that makes sense
again I got there
in a small summer's weight easier to get
on because it basically has a zip at the
front that you can just zip all the way
down and it's just super easy to go via
hips and like over the rest of your body
it actually fit pretty well considering
it's not got any adjustable straps or
anything it fit pretty well and I just
don't know what it is there's something
about it that I'm not sure on the length
of it's really nice though this is
actually the longest one of the three
that all the ones are kind of like short
but not too too short it's mine again I
do actually quite like I think it's
quite cute so this is kind of more of
like a typical pinafore to me so it's
got like the standard that straps that
you can just adjust and again it's more
of like a check pattern vibe which I
really like it's kind of like a mustard
a yellow color and like white I actually
really love the color again it just
screams like summer to me and it just
reminds me of sunflowers I don't know
why you might smear some flowers this
one's a little bit thinner as well it's
what I will say so it's not it doesn't
feel like as good quality and it creases
really easily
okay this dress really frustrates me
because I feel like this would be kind
of cute if it wasn't for the sleeves so
this is just like blue and white stripes
all over kind of what does this remind
me of like Dorothy from Wizard of Oz or
something I don't know the actual front
bit of the dress I really like so it's
basically like a mini dress but it kind
of ruffles up towards the front and
comes up like your legs I also really
like the way you can tie it because you
basically wrap it around and then tie it
as tight as you want so you can really
bring it in at the waist which I really
love I feel like I'm gonna try here this
is probably gonna sound like the
cheapest thing ever but I feel like I'm
gonna try and like cut the sleeves off
because I feel like the sleeves are just
a bit too much it's actually sewn
together like at the sleeves so I might
just try and cut like a hole the thread
and see what it looks like without
sleeves because they're just so puffy
that I feel like it's just all too much
and I do really love the way you can
tell you I don't know if I'm obsessed
with like the pattern or like the color
scheme with like the white and blue I
don't know if I'm obsessed there but I
feel like I'm gonna try it on after
cutting the sleeves off and see what I
think okay so this next piece is kind of
well it is a two-piece but when you put
it on it looks like a jumpsuit because
there was no like gap between the top
and the trousers which I actually do
like the top half is just like a black
um kind of like
laptop situation the actual cut on the
neckline I'm not really sure on I feel
like it's just in between things and it
just doesn't really look that flattering
on like it's not super rounded but it's
not really straight and the actual
bottom part the top where it's kind of
elastic a edge and kind of carved I
don't like that either because I feel
like I don't know it just doesn't work
for some reason I don't know
- well Charles I love because these are
so comfy they're literally just
elasticated like wide leg trousers
I love why the Chou's is because I feel
like there's just so comfy and if you're
going out for dinner for example you can
eat as much as you want and you have to
worry about having a food baby because
this just covers it the actual way
they're elasticated is really nice I
felt super tight on the waist which I
love and I do like that you can kind of
bring these up high enough to actually
cover the top section because I feel
like the top there's just something
about it it's not quite right by itself
I feel like it'll be cute for just
lounging around on holiday and stuff
like that I don't know okay
next thing is another mini dress this is
just like a navy color with little white
flowers all over it
this was disappointing for me because I
did really like here but the way it kind
of does up so you basically have to put
a little button through this hole here
so you kind of wrap it underneath and
then do a little button at the side and
that kind of keeps it in place but the
button just kept slipping out so I must
have put it in about three times and
then as soon as I like moved or move my
arms I just felt the button come loose
so I'm running to get a bit of a Tryon
clip for it it's such a shame because I
do actually really like the style like
it's got little frills all over it and
at the bottom it's all freely as well
and again I feel like it looks so cute
in summer with Ike a pair of trainers I
kind of wish it was just made a little
bit better because I do actually really
love the whole vibe of it I think it's
quite cute and then at the very few last
things I'm kind of torn on okay because
they're a little bit not what I would
usually wear but in some ways I do
really like them so both of them have
these little pearls all over which I
can't decide if I love or hate so the
first thing is just a pair of black
trousers again I just love myself a good
pair of black trousers these are kind of
like tapered I would say well not
tapered they kind of like mini flares so
they kind of tie it towards the top and
then at the bottom they kind of have a
little open beer and they do they don't
really flare out but they
just half a bit more like room if you
know what I mean so these fair okay they
were pretty tight on and I kind of wish
they were a little bit more high-waisted
because I felt myself really trying to
pull them up because I love stuff that's
high-waisted and then it gave me a bit
of camel toe which he wants come on say
no and then this I actually do really
love again I don't know if I love the
pearls but the actual fabric and the
color bear I'm just in love we're so
this is a bodysuit because I wanted to
make sure that I tried out one of their
body suits it's basically just a navy
color
I just love stuff that's Navy at the
minute I just I don't know I'm really
enjoying it so this again kind of has
like ruffled sleeves which I wasn't a
massive fan of on the dress but on this
I don't mind too much because this is
the only part that's like roughly if you
know what I mean so it's not like too
overwhelming yeah I love this like it's
so soft I wish you could feel this
because it's honestly so soft and I just
love the fit of it like I think that's
what sold it to me as soon as I put it
on like I just love the fit of it it
feels quite glam as well because it's
like velvet and it's Navy just feels
really royal so I don't know what do we
think about the pearls because I suppose
you could take these off if you wanted
to do we like the pills that we not like
the pearls cuz I do like the bodysuit
but I don't know I'm not sure you know
okay so that was everything that I
picked up from she and I really hope you
all enjoyed this video I hope I'm
pronouncing that right when I do my
ruffle one a lot of you said that it's
pronounced she in as if it's like two
words and but I really hope you all
enjoyed it let me know in the comments
if you liked any of these pieces because
I would love to know what you guys think
but other than that I've missed
everything so thank you so much for
watching I love you guys to the moon or
back as always and I'll see you in the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
