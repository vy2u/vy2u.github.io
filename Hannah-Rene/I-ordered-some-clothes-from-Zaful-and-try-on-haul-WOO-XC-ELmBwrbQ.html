having a fab day today we're gonna be
taking a look at Apple boys and guess so
I spend I think I spent about 250
dollars here she was like 230 250 or so
so for starters only about 2/3 of my
order showed up I don't know why I went
on the confirmation email when I ordered
that and it basically said that most of
this stuff is but it's waiting for
the rest of which I don't
understand I don't understand way to
ship them separately so I don't have my
full order here to show you but if you
want a part two and then make sure you
give this video a thumbs up and let me
know in the comments but yeah I place an
order on duffel I think I placed it last
week sometime he actually came pretty
quick everything it was pretty
inexpensive was it am i lying
am I talking okay so I've got my
order details here most of it was pretty
inexpensive it was all in dollars so I
don't actually have what it is in pounds
but I'll leave links to everything down
below if you're interested in anything
that I picked oh and I tried it all on I
filmed the Tryon Clips first just so
that I actually have a good opinion of
the pieces and stuff like that it's
interesting okay it's kind of like a
mixed bag I'm pretty sure the chicken
was quite expensive but that's because I
ordered it Express so I feel like it was
about 20 dollars or so so far I've not
had any customs any custom fees or
anything like that although because half
of the orders not here it might come
when the rest of the order arrives I
don't really know because they did
mention there might be custom and like
shipping fees import taxes you know the
drill so yeah I believe it's an American
sorry I'm not entirely sure I should
probably have done at my background
checks okay so it's owned by a Hong Kong
company I don't know it's owned by a
Hong Kong company as far as I can see it
on the website I don't actually know
where stuff at ships from I can't I
can't seem to find the information so
this is the first piece that I tried on
a no-joke when I got this out the like
package I honestly thought this was a
t-shirt so let me just show you the
length of this I thought this was a
t-shirt I was super confused because I
could only vaguely remember why I
ordered so I was a bit like did I go do
this did I not then I realized it was a
dress okay and I was like well well then
so yeah this is a dress it's kind of
hard to show because it's basically the
type of dress where you do
at the front so it has little straps and
then you can do it up in a bow like over
your boobies and then it flows down into
just like a basic dress and it's got a
little buttons and stuff like that and
materials pretty thin that's what I will
say I like the fact that it's got
adjustable straps a lot reference I am 5
foot 7 just what I'm trying stuff on I
love the fact that the actual fabric on
the breast oh yeah it's kind of double
layered so I didn't have to wear a bra
or anything like that I'm pretty sure
I'm pretty sure you couldn't see my nips
it's just a shame about the length
because honestly I just don't know if I
could go out the house in there even not
a holiday I feel like on a holiday it's
kind of acceptable to wear things there
a little bit have a little bit less
fabric because it's usually hot well if
you go on a hot holiday but even so I
don't know like I'm not convinced this
was at $21 I believe and I got it in a
size small Oki pays up another dress
because the dresses on the website did
actually look really cute I found that
the vibe was kind of like lots of
printed stuff kind of like white floral
girly prints as well yeah and can we
just look at the length of this like
it's crazy if these were places I'd be
so down because I feel like we're in a
place it that's a little bit sure it is
fine because nothing's gonna blow up or
whatever so this one has a slightly
different neckline it's kind of like a
round neckline that goes across your
whole chest it's a bit fiddly so when it
came all of these little bows were
undone so it's kind of tricky when you
first put it on because there's so many
different straps and stuff there's
basically four little tassels each side
that you can tie up into bow which again
I like because you can basically adjust
how tight you want it at the sides and
how big or small you want it to be I
don't actually like this one as much as
the last one on me because I feel like
the high like the rounded neckline
doesn't really suit me it's quite a cute
idea though I like that it's got bows
either side it just adds a little bit
more to the dress again very summery
very like holiday appropriate yeah so
that one was actually 14 dollars which
is a lot cheaper definitely more of like
the correct price I would say for
dresses like that I mean I suppose you
could wear them like over a bikini or
with bikini bottoms to the beach or
something for a cute insta what we think
I don't know what should we do next
should we carry on with the dress theme
so this was a little
more of like a dressier dress in my
opinion I found it quite hard to find
stuff on the website that was more
dressy I found that everything was
pretty casual and daytime and just like
yeah casual on daytime it didn't have
many dressy dresses they had like a
bandage just section but none of them
were like my cup of tea so I did come
across this and I thought it looks super
cute I actually love this style of
clothing and dresses at the minute as
well it's kind of like punch and ruched
is that how you say it I don't want to
butcher it yeah off-the-shoulder ruched
is that how you say that word are you CH
Edie ruched mini dress so I got this in
a medium and this was $29 so a little
bit more expensive yes basically an
off-the-shoulder vibe and then it's got
kind of share white sleeves and then the
actual dress itself is it's kind of like
a mix of news and white so the back is
more of a nude color and then the front
has all this white fabric that's just
like bruisers I don't know and it also
ties up at the chest region which I
quite like you can kind of adjust how
tight you want it to be and how much you
want your boobies to be popping you know
I quite like this I will say for my body
I've got a medium and it's quite tight
on like the upper region so like here
where the whole like you've got the tops
of the sleeves the top of the dress and
stuff like that I found it to be quite
tight I actually wore black helping
clients with every single piece just to
kind of check how see-through it was
because I feel like if anything it's
gonna be see-through and come through
it's gonna be black underwear but yeah
it felt pretty good quality is nice and
thick the material is really soft as
well like it's not scratchy on the skin
or anything like that again I kind of
have this in mind as like a summer
outfit maybe like a daytime party or an
evening party or like going out for a
meal on holiday or something like that
with a pair of heels okay I wanted to
pick up a jumpsuit I tried to get like a
mix of stuff I always try when I do
these videos to get somebody suits and
tops some dresses and skirts pop above
so this is a little bit different again
this just screams holiday to me I feel
like I've just bought clothes for like a
summer holiday again I love the fact
that there's how adjustable straps
because had it not had adjustable straps
I wouldn't have been able to wear it so
the way it works is the front is
basically just a bit of a V
a bit of a bralette situation and then
at the top of the back it's basically
got two little pieces of fabric that you
can tie it into a bow at the back and
then it's also got a zip up and it just
goes down into long wide leg trousers as
you can see it's like red and it's got
flowers all over it I don't know what
kind of flowers but it's just like a red
floral vibe this is definitely a lot
more open on the top half so it kind of
is a bit more like a plunge situation
there's a little bit more chest on the
girl had I not been able to adjust the
straps my tip thought of an hour okay
I'm just going to say now how so I
managed to make them tight enough so
that the fabric just literally laid flat
on my skin and there was gonna be no
issues with anything popping out or and
what was this this was this is the tummy
floral cutout ruffle jumpsuit I got it
in a size small and it was $30 you like
the $30 it's not too bad okay it's not
too bad I'm to a couple of body suits
that I picked oh it was really
interesting because I basically did my
duffel shop and then my I don't know how
you pronounce this of the wine is it
like Sheen oh Sh
I think it's SH ie and a lot of the
stuff was actually the same on both
websites which is really strange so this
body suit for example they had this on
both sides I don't know if they're owned
by the same people or just have the same
supplier I don't exactly know so this is
a low body soo and it kind of feels like
swimsuit material I don't know if that
makes sense like really soft kind of
stretchy swimsuit material so especially
a white body suit and then it's got palm
Leafs all over the thing that I don't
like about this is that the actual palm
leaves they've obviously just taken like
a print off the internet of like palm
leaves but it is so low quality like on
the actual jumpsuit you like I don't
know if you can see but they just look
really fuzzy I don't know if that's the
intention or what but the actual leaves
on the body see that I printed on so it
just look really low-quality like there
are really low quality photo more of
like a v-neck situation it's got quite a
low back and then the actual straps are
just little slinky straps that have no
like you can't just support anything
like that so I was thinking before I put
this on that we were gonna have some
issues luckily it did actually fit me
pretty well so I didn't find that it was
too local or too tight or anything like
the fabric did gate a little bit on the
underarm I found that it was really
stretchy and it felt quite big on which
in a sense is good for bodysuit because
I'd rather it feel a little bit too big
than a little bit too small you know how
it is in my head I just thought this
would be cute to pair with jeans maybe
or shorts like denim shorts and like a
pair of little sandals so one thing I
will say is the actual body sue a tap
like the little clips I don't know if
anyone's gonna know what I mean when I
say this but it's got the sort of
material for the bodysuit that's like
really scratchy feels like I don't know
what this material is called but it
feels like you know if you had a velcro
strap it's like what the underneath part
of the velcro is I don't know if that
makes any sense
I don't know I'm not convinced on it
yeah it's a shame because it does fit
quite well so Oh this was the Leaves
print cami bodysuit I got this in a size
and medium and it was $19 and then the
second buddy see I picked up I just
loved the color of this I thought the
color was so cute again it's got the
sort of scratchy lower half I don't know
what to call it it's got like the
scratching material at the bottom but I
didn't feel it as much on this one for
some reason which was a bit strange
obviously in a good way at home so this
is like a really lovely past early teal
color I just loved the detailing on the
neckline so it's kind of like a
sweetheart neckline in a way and then
it's just got like ruffles all around
the top which I thought was super cute a
ribbed material as well and it feels
thick but when I put it on because I
didn't wear it with a bra you could see
my nips through which I know some people
don't mind but it's just something to
bear in mind in case you do mind
although I do feel like with a body suit
like this because the neckline is kind
of quite high over the chest you could
probably wear a strapless bra and it
would be fine or just nipple covers or
something like that I love this line I
love the color of it I think it's really
cute again it doesn't have adjustable
straps but I found that it fit really
well which is really lucky for me
because I'm I'm not usually that lucky
this wine
wise so again I got this in a medium and
it was $13 64 so I think it had a little
bit of discount on it also they're
really long okay
thank the Lord that these is strange
because these are really long but the
dresses are really sure don't really
understand the logic that but luckily
these are actually really long
badi I don't know if you can tell just
by looking but they're really
comfortable they didn't suffocate my
vajayjay or anything like yeah I really
like these that pretty cute okay so
we've got another dress which I forgot
to mention earlier and I wanted to pick
up a dress that was a little bit longer
than the other ones kind of more of a
mini dress just to compare the style and
the quality and stuff like that
so this actually has a zipper at the
side which I didn't realize at first I
thought I wasn't gonna be able to get it
on because it was just too tight on my
hips but it does have a little zip which
is it really handy it's a similar vibe
to the very first dress in the sense
that it ties up over your boobs
so you basically make a little bow and
you can make it as tight or as loose as
you want
I love the style of this but I just
don't think I love the color
it's just Navy with white and has it got
black stripes no it's just maybe with
white stripes I just don't know if it's
my cuppa tea like I don't know if it
suits me the sleeves are really nice
they're kind of like a nice
three-quarter length and the actual
dress is really nice as well it's a nice
length
it feels really flowy again it would be
really nice in the summer when it's a
little bit warmer but you still want to
feel a bit covered so do you like this
so I might order something that's
similar but in a different style because
I just don't know if this style is for
me this was just over $20 which for a
nice dress I don't think that's too
expensive quality feels really nice
again it does feel kind of like on the
thin side but not in a bad quality way
like it just feels a little bit thinner
okay this I bought is a bit of a joke
but I'm actually obsessed with it so
this is a little cropped cami top you
can already see what the little boobs
are okay it basically has little carts
on either base so cute I saw this on the
website and I was like I cannot buy it
like I just can't not you guys know how
much I love cars
I am the crazy cat lady just so it was
adorable I mean I don't know when I'd
wear this maybe Halloween like maybe
this could be a cute look for Halloween
because it's black cats nicely I don't
know I don't know what I'm gonna wear
this or what I'm gonna wear it with but
I just knew that I needed to have it one
thing that's a bit annoying I try this
on and you'll see in the Tryon Clips
is that the little ears just don't stay
Oh like it's so annoying it looks way
better when the little ears
I like against your skin but they just
don't stay off and I'm like oh please
you're probably thinking AHA no have you
lost your actual marbles but how cute is
that you can't know that it's actually
door wall let me check how much this was
this was $13 so what is that like 10
pounds baby I mean there's a lot that
you could get with 10 pounds really
isn't there that's not that she could
get like a full meal you could probably
got a cute piece of jewelry you could
probably get a nice pair of trousers or
a nice skirt from Primark on this guy
did but no I'm spending my 10 pound on
this okay last but not least I should be
more in this order I'm kind of got a
that we've not got the rest of the order
but this is the last piece that I've got
to share with you right now this is
ain't jumper I wanted to get a piece of
nap no but I wanted to get a knit work
and I need help I wanted to get a knit
wet piece to a gun at try out the
quality and stuff this is a bloody thick
okay this is a thick piece of knitwear
so it's just white and then it's got I
think it's roses yeah so it's got roses
all around the neckline and then it also
has it roses on the sleeve the actual
pattern of like the knitting is
different on the body to what it is on
the sleeves I don't know what knitting
styles are called but I just know it's
different this is really cute I kind of
wish that it was shaped a little bit
differently because I feel like it's a
bit of an awkward length like it's not a
normal length but it's not a crotch
length if that makes sense
also those sleeves are like they feel
really big but it's kind of hard to roll
the box it's like embroidered here yeah
I'm excited to give this a go I started
to try and style it I don't know what
I'm gonna wear it with yet probably just
a pair of jeans or something like that
so that was $14 which for a jumper is
actually not that bad at all inexpensive
and I got it was in one size so I just
got a one size maybe that explains it
then cuz it's just one size so yeah it's
pretty much everything that I have for
now from my Zappa order let me know what
you think in the comments down below let
me know if there's anything that you
like and what you don't like I would
love to know I'm gonna go anyway because
I need to edit this video if you want
more videos like this then let me know
like I said I have done an order on gene
don't know how you say that I'm gonna
have to learn that before I actually
film the video yeah let me know if you
want any other brands to be tested
because I do love a film in a good
clothing hall slash testing video I love
you guys anyway on I'll see you in the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
