you're all having a lovely day today
we're gonna be having a look at the
makeup revolution foundation sticks
which I am so excited about these are
super affordable and they look pretty
promising I'm not gonna lie rather than
do it the exact same as the last video
where I just test that one foundation
stick all over the skin
I thought we'd mix it off a little bit
so I'm gonna be doing a half the makeup
revolution foundation stick and then
half of my makeup forever her nation
safe which I love it's one of my
favorite products of all time did you
actually buy four shades of the makeup
revolution one on super drug and then
they very kindly sent them to me like a
day later which was so spooky so thank
you to makeup revolution for sending
these over so they've sent it over 18
shades I'm not sure if this is the full
shade range because I'm pretty sure I
saw on that Instagram story is not so
long ago that they aren't gonna do quite
a lot of shades and make it really
inclusive which is obviously really cool
so I might just try out for now other
shades that I actually bought so I
picked up two like base shades and then
a darker like two darker shades for
cream contour cuz I have a darker makeup
forever one for cream contour as well
okay so just to give you a little bit of
information about both sticks so so far
this one does have 18 shades faster
based foundation quickly perfect
contours and highlights your complexion
the easy to apply it stick formula melts
into the skin at blend in seamlessly to
leave a fresh and chewy
finish I'm all about the jury life so so
far so guys I can't seem to find out on
the website like well on Superdrug how
much product it actually contains it's
got like the dimensions of the product
but it doesn't have like the way or the
actual like amount of product I guess
and then we've got my makeup forever
stick which I have loved for so long
it's from my favorite foundations of all
time so this is 30 pounds which is like
wow six times the price is that right I
don't know five times who knows 15 16 17
18 19 20 okay so this as far as I know
has 20 shades that is the actual
packaging in comparison so they're kind
of the same size in terms of the actual
packaging the makeup revolution one is
just long and skinny and the makeup
forever one is just a little bit more
chunky so with that being said I am
gonna do the makeup for everyone first
just because I've used it so many times
it's really quick and easy for me to
meet to apply so I'm gonna start with
the benefit Porefessional
radiant pearl primer this is the new
edition of the Porefessional family feel
like I've got makeup under my eyes
that's because I have cute so I'm just
gonna do half my face so I guess we'll
do makeup forever this side and makeup
revolution on the left which will maybe
be your right I'm not entirely sure so I
just like to put a tiny tiny dot of this
um right in like the sensual area of my
cheek I guess and like the center of my
t-zone area I just find that recently my
paws have been looking a lot larger for
some reason which is so strange because
I never really used to have issues with
my paws appearing big um but this is
really nice I can't use the normal
professional I was talking about this in
a video the other day but I can't use
the normal one because it's quite drying
on my skin but this one still gives like
a nice radiant finish then for the rest
of the skin I'm gonna use smashbox photo
finish primer water i'm just gonna spray
it all over and then we'll redo it when
we do the makeup revolution sighs um in
terms of the finish makeup forever is
very jewy in my opinion it's why I like
it because my skin is quite dry the
shade that I use is one one eight which
equals y three to five it's like a
yellow base so they kind of work in
either yellow base or like a rose base
as far as I know right my camera's just
run out whilst I was filming that which
was so annoying so I'm gonna try and do
this as quick as possible because it's
not got a lot of battery so the way that
I apply it stick foundations I always
take a buffing brush this is a mafia m4
3:9 is just a really large like dense
buffing brush and I'm literally just
gonna take the foundation on the brush
like so so I literally just apply the
product to the bristles I just find it
easier and I feel like you get more
coverage compared to if you apply it to
the skin so I'm just gonna coat the
whole brush this is a pretty full
coverage foundation I would say it's
like medium to fall just gonna go ahead
and start applying that
how do you like to apply a fair bit I
will just say actually much is my neck
perfectly today thank the Lord I haven't
actually used this foundation with
benefit Porefessional yet so hopefully
it works and look so high reason I like
this foundation is because it always
feels really weightless on the skin but
still gives a good coverage and it has a
really nice finish as well I also find
that the sticks last me a long time so
even though they are expensive you do
get your money's worth from them that is
what it looks like I've just switched my
light down a little bit so that you can
see it a bit better and then I'm quickly
just gonna clean this brush ready for
when we do the other sides I don't
actually have a spare foundation brush
it's gonna wipe the product off just so
it's fair and square and both have like
the clean brush and there's not any
excess product on the shade that I use
for cream con so it's not really contour
it's not a bronzer because this is
pretty warm and this is the shade for y4
4/5 which again is like a yellow tone so
with this one I do actually draw this
onto the skin of it because we're only
using a small amount so I'm just gonna
do the forehead / temple region and then
under the cheekbone and then the jawline
as well it's quite warm so I wouldn't
really consider it to be contour it just
adds like a healthy glow to the skin
then I'm gonna go in with a buck sage at
beauty foundation brush it's just a
similar brush but a little bit smaller
so you've got a little bit more
precision with the application I'm just
gonna press that into the skin I don't
like to sweep too much just because it
can remove the foundation a little bit
if you start like dragging the brush
around your skin and then again just
gonna press in and you always want to
blend upwards so kind of just actually
press in move the brush up
and then I do kind of just swipe at the
jawline just because I don't really put
any foundation on this region so you
don't have to worry about like taking
any foundation off and you want to make
sure that jawline is like super buttocks
you don't want to have like a harsh line
around it so yeah that is how that side
looks I love this foundation I always
forget to use it I don't need to use it
more because it just gets pots like the
back of my collection so I'm always
trying new stuff out but this is just a
go-to for me like I love it so much so
well just clean this brush as well a
little bit larger so that we know huh
this is the thing so I use a brush
cleaner by cinema secrets absolutely
obsessed with it but it's literally just
an open-top so you end up pouring so
much out that you just don't need
Weishaupt just drives I'm quickly gonna
prime this side so I'm just going to do
the exact same thing I'm just going to
apply it a little bit of professional to
my cheeks firm eye and biggest to pull
ah I really need to get my nails done
I'm betting I'm done on Friday and I'm
so excited I've been trying to have a
break from like wearing acrylics because
they just ruin your nails but they
really need some like TLC my nails okay
so why is my camera died I did swatch
some of the shades just to check what
shade would be the best match so so
right at the top here I think is yes the
very top shade on my hand here is makeup
forever what I've got on this side my
base color and so I'm thinking that
makeup revolution f8 is the best match
which is the one it just below it not
quite as yellow it's got a bit more of a
pinky undertone to it but hopefully it
won't pick up too much and then in terms
of the darker shades we've got makeup
forever and the bronzer shade that I
just used I think it's why 4 for 5 or 4
to 5 which is in the middle there and
then this side we have makeup revolution
I think that's f12 and then f13 on the
other side so there's quite a big jump
between f12 and f/13 but we'll just have
to use after well it's not quite as warm
so again it's a little bit more unlike
the pinky side but hopefully a look okay
just off the swatch though I can
definitely tell that they are juhi which
is what the description said they
actually
feel very similar to my makeup for
everyone and the finish looks really
similar as well the show you actually
looks pretty similar like it's not too
too different it does seem to be
applying a little bit darker actually
than the makeup forever one which is
strange because it doesn't look that
much darker on my hands feels very
similar like it kind of applies in a
very similar way and I feel like the
finish is very similar like they both
kind of have a glowy and chewy finish I
feel like I used a similar amount of
product for the same outcome so I feel
like both sides look pretty much the
same amount of coverage in the same
finish and I feel like I used about the
same product on the skin I'm then gonna
go in with the darker shade so we've got
after 12 it definitely use a little bit
darker this side I don't know if you can
tell just look in here and like in the
center of the skin okay it's quite a lot
cooler that's what I will say so I'll
just applied that for now
blend it out pretty similar as well do
be honest looking at them on the skin I
actually can't really see a difference
whatsoever
the finish is pretty much identical
which I don't know if they've done that
on purpose and they've tried to like
just imitate what the makeup forever
stick is and obviously sell it at a
cheaper price but they have the exact
same finish as far as I can see make up
forevers might be a tiny bit more chewy
but very similar so we're gonna do
concealer next I'm gonna use makeup
revolution concealing define I think
it's called and then I'll use Tarte
shape tape this side so that's my
favorite high-end concealer at the
minute I've got those shaded medium and
this shade light sand which is what I
always use a for Tarte shape tape so I'm
just gonna start with the shade medium
and pop that under the eyes I'll do
Tarte shape tape nose and then makeup
revolution chin and forehead what do we
think I don't know they always go in
with a little bit of light sand just on
top of medium because medium is pretty
much the same shade as my foundation in
terms of the concealer and the amount of
products you get you do get more insight
shape tape so you've got 0.33 fluid
ounces and in makeup revolution you get
zero point one one fluid ounce it is but
it's reasonably cheaper so what shade
should I use I don't actually have a
dark shade in this like I don't have a
shade that's like the same as medium so
we'll just have to use like just the
lighter one and help it back I'm just
going to use the same Beauty Blender for
this by the way because I don't have two
Beauty blenders on the go and I can't
really be asked lean in it so side is
obviously a little bit bright and I hope
because we've only used the lighter
shade on this side just gonna try and
blend it down a little bit so it doesn't
look as obvious then I'm gonna set both
of them in place and set the whole face
where that brim will stay matte because
that is like my go-to at the minute I'm
obsessed with this powder it's a lot the
concealers look like before they've been
sat so again they look pretty identical
I'd say they have to
my coverage pretty much the same finish
like that kind of luminous in a way
they're not like muck concealers feel
like my skin looks insane hey everything
just looks so seamless and flawless okay
so I finished off my makeup just do
something it really I was not saying
natural but this isn't exactly a natural
localize guy so far both sides look
pretty much identical so I can't really
tell a difference between the two
looking at them in person basically the
same I can't see anything different on
one side to the other I don't know if
anyone else can
but yeah I'm pretty impressed for a
foundation stick that costs 5 pounds so
I'm gonna go about my day for a bit and
I'll check in in a couple of hours and
we'll see how it's holding up so it's
quite - eh it's probably been about five
hours since I stopped filming I haven't
actually looked it yet so I mean my lip
product is just completely gone because
I have been eating and drinking and
stuff like that I'm about to get chippy
I'm so excited you guys know I love a
good fish and chips well just chips
because I don't eat fish but I feel like
it sounds bad when you say fish and
chips you know I mean I love a good
chick peas what I'm trying to say if I'm
gonna be a hundred and ten percent
honest boys and girls I can't see any
difference in either side I can tell
that I've got different foundations on
or different concealers it's come off a
little bit on my nose just because I do
sometimes like you know just wipe my
nose and stuff oh this is the left side
and don't mind my lipstick I gotta be
off stop knocks I'm gonna take this off
in a minute this is the left sighs this
is all of the makeup revolution products
so the base the highlights by the way is
the L'Oreal Wang which is now actually
on superdrug online if anyone wants to
pick it up I'll leave a link below but
yeah this is the makeup revolution looks
pretty seamless I would say definitely
still has a luminous finish which I
personally like and then that is all of
the makeup forever side so Make Up For
Ever foundation sticks blah blah blah
yeah that's how everything looks
hopefully the camera is picking it up
well enough I mean I feel like it looks
pretty seamless still for a 5-pound
foundation a four-pound concealer
a 30-pound foundation and I don't even
know how much taught shape sabers
because I pay for it in dollars but it
must be like 18 pounds or so you just
you can't deny it Kenya
you can't deny what your eyes are
telling you they love the same can
anyone tell the difference like if you
didn't know I had two different
foundations and see different concealers
on would you know because I don't think
you would icon and it's like my face I'm
gonna go anyway because I'm ready for a
chippy
I want my chips and gravy so thank you
it's so much for watching I love you
guys to the moon about a million times
over as always and I'll see you in
Sunday's video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
