so excited about because it's actually
gonna be something a little bit
different so as you all know I have had
blondish hair for a couple of months now
it's kind of like dip dyed it's like
blonde towards the bottom and then quite
dark at the roots and I thought it'd be
really fun to kind of switch it up a
little bit and do something different
with it because I'm not gonna lie I'm a
little bit over the blonde now so this
video is actually gonna be in
collaboration with Clara because they
very kindly send over a bunch of their
new Clairol color crave semi-permanent
color so this one is in the color
scarlet they did very kindly send over
the entire range so I'll sort of show
you a little bit an overview of all of
the colors so these are basically
semi-permanent colors that wash out
within 10 to 15 Y she is possibly more
depending on how your hat takes the
color and which i think is really far
because I'm the sort of person where I
don't like to commit to a color all the
time I do like to switch my hair a lot
so it's really useful for people he'd
like to have a play around and not
commit to just one color they do also
have a range of color crepe hair makeup
as well which is only a wash out color
so it's not it doesn't last as long as
these ones but again it's really good
say if you just want to switch your hair
up just for the day I don't have those
hair to show you but there are six
shimmer and shades of the hair makeup
which is the one that saw washes that
within a day or within one wash and then
there's 11 shades of the semi-permanent
color crave color so this is what the
box looks like obviously every single
color is different on the front
depending what diet it is and then this
is what it looks like on the back so it
kind of has a little bit of a color
chart where it shows you what the color
will look like depending on what color
hair you already have so because mine is
kind of like I saved mine's like the
middle tone of blonde I'm hoping it's
gonna be quite a deep red so inside you
just have a sort of information and I'm
guessing this is like instructions and
things just basically everything you
need to know when you're gonna use it
and then you've got a little pocket that
has a brush and also some gloves and
gloves are gonna be super important
because it will stain it is like a dye
and so this is why I've got like a old
t-shirt on as well and then obviously
you've got the color which is the main
part so boys and girls we're gonna start
off with what the first step is so on
the back it just says to wash and towel
dry hair which is good because my hair
honestly needs a wash is living after I
shampoo right now
I'm gonna go away and I'm gonna wash I'm
gonna try and watch without ruining my
makeup things cause it works we will
find out but I'll be back in a minute
well not a minute but you know what I
mean okay so I wash my hair i shampooed
and conditioned it and I just left it in
a towel for a little bit until it's like
double dry I guess I've parted it as
well so half of it is on top of my head
just so that when I'm coloring it and
when I'm dyeing it I know that I'm
getting every single piece of hair so
half of its on top and then I've just
done a parting down the back and just
split it in two so the next step on the
Box just says wearing gloves apply color
to chosen sections of hair with hands or
included brush fully saturate out with
products so that's what we're gonna do
I've just got a little disposable cop
cop bowl just to put the color end so
that's what the color looks like in the
bowl I'm gonna work these on I'm
probably gonna use my hands for most of
it but I'm just gonna use the brush to
apply the first ones there okay the
camera is a little bit lower just so
that you can see where I'm actually
applying it
I can't zoom on this lens like I can't
find my other lens since I moved so this
one's gonna have to do it's gonna start
a play in here like so oh my gosh it's
so rad then I'm just gonna kind of try
and like blend it in with my hand
already got some on the t-shirt nice one
oh my gosh and I've got it on my arm I'm
actually a nightmare okay so I'm just
gonna like rub my hair as well just to
make sure that I don't miss any blonde
patches because my hair is quite thick
as well okay so I'm pretty sure that
section is done you can kind of see the
color more like at the ends that why
didn't I wear like a t-shirt with a more
round neck there anything that's not
done I'm conscious of like getting it on
my face so I'm trying to not to drag it
over to my I can make my hair too close
to my face
alright I'm just gonna try and like comb
with my fingers a little bit just so I
know that it's gonna blend when it's all
washed out I'm gonna start doing this
side and then other side like if I want
to take it up however or not but this
guy's feeling a little neglected
we're gonna start working on him that's
all I'm gonna use on that side I'm
pretty sure that is all coated like I
cannot see any way that I've missed all
right so I'm pretty sure this is the
cutest bond you've ever seen in your
whole life so the next step just says to
wait 20 minutes for colors to set off of
Baldur results wait 30 so I'm probably
gonna wait 30 just because I want it to
be sorry my head is just like gone and
then after you've waited it just says to
rinse thoroughly with water until the
water runs clear so I'll probably get
mom to help me do that but yeah I'm
going to leave it on for 30 minutes
rinse it out and then I'll be back in a
minute I'm also gonna have a wash and
change this top because let's be honest
I've made a mask okay so this is the
finished result I like to just wash it
out until the water so it was clear with
a little bit of conditioner just so it
was easier to brush because my hair gets
so naughty and it is actually the next
day just because I'm gonna style it and
curl it and my hair is so difficult to
style when it's been freshly washed so
that is what we're gonna do now I'm just
gonna curl it really happy with the
results so far though I feel like it's
gonna look even better when it's styled
if you don't want it to be this vibrant
then you can mix the color with
conditioner before you apply it to your
hair and it won't be as bright so I'm
literally just going to curl it okay so
just a side note as well as to when I
curl my hair I always do one strand away
from my head and then one strand towards
and it's probably not gonna be super
easy to see because this is sped up but
I just wanted to let you know because I
love the way it looks after it's all
done because all the curls can kind of
like interlock and they just look really
pretty if you do them all one way as
well and they kind of just blend into
like one curl sometimes so it's a good
tip just to like curl them one way and
then the other and do them alternative
ways just because it will look really
pretty in the end so this is pretty much
my hat sped up okay so this is look
number one I pretty much just curled it
and then how to play around with it and
back combed it and stuff and then it
flipped it over on one side you can't
keep a middle part in if you want but I
feel like my hair always looks way more
like voluminous and just full and bouncy
when it's like flipped over so that's
what I've done
I feel like this hairstyle it
complements the color so well like I'm
absolutely loving it so this is pretty
much the finished look I'm gonna do one
more hairstyle as well just in case you
want to do like a half up half down kind
of vibe
you don't run it all down because I love
that look sometimes as well so I'm gonna
show you how I do that now so you just
want to kind of part your hair where I'm
gonna do it at the top of my ears are
and go straight back just so that half
of it is kind of going up and then the
other half is staying down so it can
kind of just feel you can use a comb as
well if you want to be like super neat
but I'm not super neat person and then
once you've got that you can just begin
to like hot okay so half of it is now up
it's up to you if you put it in a bun or
if you Janet in a ponytail and I was
going to do it in a bond but I think I'm
gonna do a pony just because it's curled
so I feel like with like the bits that
are up and then the bits that are down
it'll all kind of blend really well
together because it's all curls okay and
then I'm just gonna go back in with my
curler because obviously these bits that
were right underneath when I initially
curled it would not I didn't really curl
them because they weren't at the front
and but now they are like more on show
I'm just gonna go back in and curl them
a little bit more so they kind of blend
in with the rest so that is look number
two if you wanted to do something a
little bit different and have a half up
half down instead so yeah that is the
end of the video so I really hope you
all enjoyed it thank you so much for
watching and a huge thank you to Clairol

than that I think that is pretty much it
