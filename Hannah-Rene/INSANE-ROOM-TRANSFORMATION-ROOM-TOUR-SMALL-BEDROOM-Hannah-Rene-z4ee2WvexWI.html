going to be a room tour and room
transformation because I have literally
changed my entire bedroom since I've
moved home so I don't mind my parents I
look like a toe it's fine literally
stripped everything out repainted got
new flooring every single piece of
furniture in my bedroom now is brand new
like nothing is the same I felt a little
bit of us switching the room open like
ripping everything out and redoing it so
it's gonna be kind of like a room
transformation and room tour just
because I will show you as well like
what all the furniture and stuff is
afterwards quick side note there is not
a Wardrobe in my room anymore I used to
have massive at fit furniture in my
bedroom I completely shut out and my
wardrobe is actually in a different room
in the house now it's in like the sort
of spare bedroom study area just because
my room is a little bit smaller not
uncomplaining absolutely love it but
obviously I need to film eat glib sleep
work edit do everything in this room so
we wanted it to feel as big as possible
and use the space as well as we could so
I've literally just got my bed and like
some filming areas and my makeup and
stuff and a big mirror I've wanted a big
full-length American hair is so long but
yeah I think that's everything that I
wanted to say and let me know if you've
got any questions about anything that I
mentioned in this video or anything like
that I will link every single product
down below so if you want to know where
anything is wrong if you want to know
anything it's just wrong well even the
paint's Brown I'm gonna link as much
that kind down below I think that's
pretty much it so I really hope you all
enjoy a good massive thumbs up if you do
and if you want to see what I did to my
room just keep watching okay so this is
what my room will look like before we
well pretty much when we started
stripping everything out so those of you
who have been watching my videos for a
while you'll know what my old room
looked like I will link my room so down
below if you're interested to see what
it was like before and I think it's a
pretty old video now but it kind of
gives you an idea of the furniture and
things like that so as you can see I had
massive fitted wardrobes which were all
stripped and rich out my room they
actually went next door to the next-door
neighbor which was really cool so we've
pretty much spent the day taking all of
these apart they were so heavy and
because I like proper sturdy like fitted
furniture and then we moved the next
door because they don't fit in the room
where I now have my wardrobe so I have a
slightly smaller wardrobe in there which
was just from Ikea and but obviously the
the wall the part of the wall where the
wardrobes was is that kind of weird pink
color because we painted white around it
so this is what the room looks like when
all of that was stripped out you can see
my carpet and things like that I did
have some white shelves where my desk it
used to be and then I also had my bed in
the corner which was just a kind of like
silver frame that and but yeah this is
pretty much what it looked like when she
came to say hello and then once
everything was stripped out my boyfriend
Kane very kindly came around to help me
paint because I couldn't have done this
by myself my family were on holiday at
the time so I'll link the paint down
below that we used and it took was about
two coats total I'm pretty sure so we
did it over two days so it could dry but
yeah I thought I'd include some little
clips I was doing this
so this is what the room would look like
after everything was painted and the
floor man that came to fit the floor so
I decided to get lemon at this time just
because obviously I do a lot of makeup
and stuff and my carpet always got dirty
so easily a first-world problem I know
but I just thought I'd be able to keep
this cleaner so if you want to know what
Florin is I'll try and link it down
below if I can find it and but this is
the fun part now so this is my room
completely done with all the furniture
the bad the light in everything like
that so I'm gonna go through all of the
furniture and stuff like I said it will
all be linked down below so the bed
itself is from eBay it was from an eBay
boutique it was about 300 pounds it is
an awesome embed which is really like
handy as well because it actually has a
lot of storage under the bed and the
bedding is from John Lewis it is by a
brand called Harlequin I'll try and link
it down below but I'm pretty sure it was
a limited edition the cushions are from
John Lewis and Zara so the big two gold
ones at the front of John Lewis and then
the fluffy one is Zara the fairy lights
it from Amazon I will link them down
below because you guys always ask about
those but as you can see it is an
ottoman so it lifts up and the bed sheet
and the pillows like the actual sheet
that's on the bed is from Dunelm mill is
the comfiest bed she ever literally
every single time Isla comes around she
drools over the bed sheets it's so cozy
but yeah you can just see that it's kind
of like a cozy material it's called
teddy bedding I think I'll try and link
it down below but I know they only sell
it in like the awesome in wintertime and
the throw at the end is also part of
like the teddy range from Dunelm mills
so if it's still in store and they've
like brought it back out I'll link it
below and this is the bedside table that
I have next to my bed so the lump is
from Ikea I'll again link it down below
I think it was about 30 pounds or so
it's really cute I feel like it looks
really pretty and then a little jar the
number 5 Chanel jaw I actually made
myself and I thought I'd do a little DIY
for like flowers and rose pots and like
makeup brush parts and stuff so if you
interested in those let me know and I
can put the spare ones that I have on
Etsy because I do have some left over
and then the candle I don't know what
brand it's by it was a gift from L'Oreal
which is why it says Hannah but I'll try
and link the brand down below and then
the actual bedside table which is this
really cool like marriage bedside table
is from eBay so again will be in the
description bar that kind of gives you
an overview of the bed area
onto this section this is the section
next to my door so this tiny unit is
from Argos it was about 30 pounds as
well I think and it basically holds all
of my underwear some eunuchs and
brownies and then this is the start of
my huge makeup area which I am obsessed
with this now it makes me so happy that
I have so much room for this because
this is where my wardrobes used to be
but obviously this was like a ton of
free space now I do have a TV above it
all which is obviously for when I'm like
in bed and I want to watch TV and stuff
it's the same TV that I had before it's
by Panasonic and and it just is super
handy because you can just a lie in bed
and watch Netflix and stuff like that
this is the first Alex show this is the
tall set of Alex shores and I just have
my bose mini Soundlink which is a
wireless speaker on it and then I have
two candles from Alton Brown because
they're my fave candles ever and I also
have a part with it like nail varnishes
and stuff in and then on to this section
I've got my big light-up mirror which
this was made by my dad so I can't
actually link it down below but I'll
link something similar and that's the
only thing that was like how made art
form like that to pop some stuff and but
this kind of gives you an overview of
the desk area so I have three small Alex
drawers and then to desk to put on top
so I'm gonna do a more in depth makeup
collection so I'm not going to go
through this like tons and tons but I'll
link the little mirror down below like
the smaller mirror that's on the right
and then I've just got a bunch of
containers and stuff like pencils and
lipsticks and things this chair again is
from Ikea sorry I will link it down
below and then the rug is from Ikea as
well I just popped it on top and then
the sort of feathery cushion is from
Zara
and I have the exact same thing on the
opposite side but different colors I
just thought it'd look really cute so
I'll try and link it all down below if
Sarah still stuck the cushions I then
have this little clip board in the
middle whether to decimate so as you can
see the artists table tops from Ikea
again so I'll link them down below and
but it's just a little calendar I
thought it was really cute I found it on
Etsy and you can just print it out so it
was super cheap again will be down below
I feel like I've said that a million
times and well it's just on an acrylic
clipboard which was from Amazon so it's
on the month September at the minute
obviously we're in September and it just
has like all the like patterns of the
moons and stuff I just thought was
really cute to go on the desk and then
this is like the biggest section of my
makeup
so I have a bunch of acrylic containers
now the ones on the very end are from
Muji which hold all the lipsticks it
will pop them down below all the parts
again at ones that I made myself so if
you're interested I can put the spare
ones on Etsy and the ones in the middle
are from Amazon so again
will be down below this cute little
thing is a diffuser sorry from Muji and
you can basically put essential oils in
it and it diffuses and it makes the room
smell really lovely it's really common
and things like that and then on the end
of my desk I just have my happiness
planner which I need to get into the
habit of using I really love the concept
of it it's really really cute and then I
have a weekly planner underneath which I
used to have in my old flat I've just
popped it there so again we'll pop it
down below then this area is just my
windowsill I've got a little Teddy that
cane one for me an arcade and a bunch of
roses all the roses in my room by the
way I just life-long roses from like
Endora in the trapper Center if anyone
knows that and then on this side of the
windowsill I've got all of my books and
then a teddy that me and Kane got on our
first little trip away and then we are
on to the last part of the room so this
is where I have my full length through
now so excited that I have this it's
actually the one that I used to have my
flat and I didn't think it would fit in
but we managed to find space for it so
that was that and I have another tool
set of Alex Shores these all hold like
toiletries and stuff by the way it's not
just makeup and the makeup the lipstick
towels from Amazon I'll put it below and
then I have another Chanel part that I
made and then a candle which I go and
I'll try and find online and then the
mirror was from ebay it was quite
expensive it's about 90 pounds but I
feel like it's just such a fab mirror
that it's really worth it so that's an
overview of that section and then at the
bottom on the floor I've got a container
from NYX which was sent as PR thank you
next I absolutely love it cuz it holds
all of my hot tools and then I just have
a bin and some sliders so I really hope
