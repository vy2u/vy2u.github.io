I feel like it's been such a long time since I sat down and filmed a video
So I hope you're all well. I'm in a new set up,
I finally moved into an office space which I'm so excited about, and yeah today we're just gonna have a sit down and a chat.
I filmed this makeup look
although I don't really want to call it a tutorial because I
Kind of just wanted to sit down and have a chat and like a catch up and things like that
So it's not really a tutorial as such
Plus, I'm not obsessed with this makeup because I don't have any powder brushes. I don't have any face brushes
I've genuinely done this whole look with a sponge and just this one brush
So I just had to make do with what I had so I realise it's not the best
So, please don't come for me, please, please, please
but yeah, I just wanted to have a sit-down and a catch-up because I realise I've not uploaded for a
Long time a long time. For me anyway, it's been like about 4 weeks. I think I'm so excited to be filming again
Like I've missed it so much
I'm excited to just have more space like honestly filming in my bedroom was just the biggest ball ache for so long
I just had no room for lights and like
Cameras and stuff like that. And I want to make an effort to just make my videos a little bit more
Professional now and give you as much content as possible
So I feel like this is just a fresh start and I'm just so excited
But yeah, I'm gonna stop rumbling anyway, and make sure this intro isn't like a million hours long
So if you want to have a chat and see this kind of makeup look
Although it kind of looks like a sack of shit then just keep watching. 'Like a sack of shit'
I say that all the time, I just sit I'm like I look like a sack of shit.
'That's such a bad way of saying it though'
A sack of shit. 'I look like shit yeah but a
SACK of shit' üòÇ
Yeah, also Kane is filming with me today, he's sat behind the camera helping me with a second camera because like I said
I want to make my videos a little bit more Va va voom
So don't mind me if I seem a little bit like quiet and awkward when this video first starts because I don't usually film
With other people in the room, so it took me a minute to adjust
But yeah and Toffees here as well. So if you hear a dog snoring halfway through that's toffee. But yeah
Love you
Okay, so I'm gonna start with skin because my face and my neck are a little bit of a mess, so please don't mind that
I have excess fake tan on and I've also been getting like a really bad, I don't know what it is
It's a like dry skin, or it's kind of like a rash on my neck at the minute
So I'm gonna start off with a little bit of magic cream by Charlotte Tilbury. This is a brand new one
It's like a little mini as well, which I thought was super cute
So I'm gonna have to find somewhere to like prop this up as well because I've not got a mirror
I've got no brushes. Okay. I've not got a proper mirror
So this is gonna be a challenge but it's fine. Just gonna pop this all over the skin
the smell of this always reminds me of my mum because I bought this cream for my mum for Christmas and she wears it like
All the time. She's absolutely obsessed with it. So
Whenever I give her a hug, I can always smell it on her skin because the scent of it's actually like quite strong
I'm gonna put some on my neck. This is well
Honestly, I don't know what has happened
This past week. I woke up the other day and I had like all red blotchiness on my neck. And because I fake tan
Like it's just made the tan go really weird. It might be heat rash. I feel like I get heat rash quite a lot
You should moisturise more. You don't look after your skin
Okay. And then I'm gonna use a little bit of the rodial dragon's blood eye cream
Which I have used a lot
Recently. This gets so gross like this is the only thing I don't like about this product, the packaging
ends up looking so gross because it's kind of like a little..
You pump it up and you always get excess product, like it looks disgusting
But I'm just gonna put this under the eyes. Eye cream is one thing that I never used to use
I feel like I've said this in other videos, but it's one thing that I never used to use and it honestly..
Since I started using it like it makes such a difference
This stuff's expensive by the way rodial, but I do quite like this product
Okay, I'm just gonna prime I'm using the makeup revolution Pro base aqua priming base base primer
I mean my hands are like really slippy now because of the moisturiser
Kind of smells like roses but now that it's been opened a bit, smells weird
So I'm gonna do skin first. I feel like I've already said that. Sorry if I keep looking down here my mirrors down here
It's like my tiny little mirror in a palette. That's all I've got. I'm just gonna do foundation. I'm using the Loreal infallible
Pro glow 24-hour
Foundation in the shade 204. I feel like I've used this on camera
I do really love this and I've genuinely got no face brushes so I'm gonna try and do everything with a sponge
It's gonna be a bit dark, but it is what it is. I've just got some on my leg
What is this with my skin here? Like I don't I
Don't understand. It's like eczema, but not. Yeah so basically, because this is the first video I've uploaded for about..
or it might be the second. I don't know which I'll edit first because I have filmed a clothing haul as well
So this all started, like I didn't actually intend to take time off
But me and Kane went on holiday to Barcelona and Santorini at the end of April
So we went to Barcelona for two days
At the end of April and then I think we flew to Santorini on the 1st of May
but the way it worked is that
We got home from Barcelona on the 30th and then we flew to Santorini the day after. So I went to Barcelona
I'd worked so hard all that week. I think we flew on like a Thursday or a Friday
I'd worked so hard all that week
I'd filmed like three or four videos that I hadn't edited because I didn't quite have the time to edit them
but I was gonna basically edit them in Barcelona and
Santorini and the have content for like the two weeks or the week that we were away. I had my laptop and everything
And we only really took like really small cases
So technically they could have been hand luggage but because I take makeup
I just I don't know how people
travel
with hand luggage
With just makeup, unless you put everything into like really small containers because I feel like everything I have is way over 100 ml
I'm just gonna use makeup revolution
Concealer for my under eyes and to highlight. So this is in the shade
C7 anyway, yeah, I was gonna edit them.
I actually started editing in Barcelona and then I was gonna edit the rest in
Santorini and I was gonna have like loads of content to upload. So we flew the airline to Barcelona called
Vueling that's yeah, so we flew it an airline called Vueling
It sounds really weird when I say in my voice 'Vueling'. They basically lost my luggage, cut a long story short,
They basically lost my luggage. So on the way back
We landed in Manchester. It was like the last flight coming in in the evening. We got in dead late and
They hadn't put like basically 2/3 of everyone's luggage on the plane
so it wasn't just me like loads of people did not have their luggage and I
Remember being in the airport and I genuinely was like, so angry. I nearly cried like I was close to crying
I was just so frustrated because it had all my makeup, my laptop,
my brushes, like my hair styling stuff all the stuff that I was gonna take to Santorini a day later,
was all in that case, so I basically had like near enough nothing to take to Santorini
They said that it was gonna be put on a flight the next morning
But the way it worked is like, I just wouldn't have had the time to pick it up before flying to Santorini
So I had just had to make do without my laptop and stuff like that
So I feel like that was about a week and a half
Or maybe two weeks at that point with no content because we got back
I think on like the 6th of May maybe. And then I don't know what happened, but I just
Got myself into like, I don't know. I have phases. Sometimes I just feel really down and
I'm just like not
Feeling filming if that makes sense feel like I went through a stage like that last year as well like this time last year
um
I just I
Don't know what it is like sometimes I just get really down and I just don't feel like filming,
I don't feel like sitting in front of the camera. I feel like I spoke about this in a video that I did
Like a month ago when I last uploaded because I'm sure I did a chatty Q&amp;amp;A
and I was just saying if I ever
Just feel down and I don't feel
In the right mood to film then I won't force myself to do it because I feel like you can really tell
And I feel like that's not healthy, to just sit... I
don't know. I feel like it's not healthy to be on social media when
You don't feel mentally healthy. For bronzer I'm gonna use, well, it's actually a contour stick. This is by benefit
So this is the hoola quickie contour stick
I think it just comes in one shade actually. This sheers out quite a lot as well
So I feel like you can be quite
heavy-handed with it.
I'm gonna have to put the mirror down. I don't know how people actually
Do makeup holding a mirror all the time? Like I can't do it
But yeah, that's kind of why I didn't upload for a little bit. I feel like, I don't know..
I don't like to make excuses when I don't upload but I just wasn't
In the right like frame of mind, you know, so I
Just took like a little bit of time out.
And then at the same time I was moving into this office, which I am so excited to be working in now
Because I think that's another thing
I think it gets hard sometimes to work at home and like have
The right amount of discipline to kind of separate your work life and your home life
and actually, I don't know, be as productive as you can be. That's one thing about working at home - like it seems so
Good at first and it is really good that you can just work at home, but I don't know after a little bit. I
Think it gets quite challenging and I don't know if it's just me..
Yeah, I'm excited to have like a place to actually come to work and have so much more space
I have got so much more room now. I've got more lighting, because that was another thing
I feel like in my past videos like the lighting just wasn't bright enough because I could only fit one
Tiny light in my room. Yeah, I'm back now
And I'm excited to be making more content and things like that
I think I'm gonna try and mix my content up a little bit as well. Like I still want to do makeup and fashion
But I feel like I might have a day in the week where I do
just like a day for completely different types of content as well. Like chatty videos and
Cooking videos and just going out and doing stuff videos. Like random stuff
because I love watching those types of videos as well rather than just makeup &amp;amp; fashion, like conspiracy videos. I would love to do those
So I'm gonna try and mix my channel up a bit. I feel like that'll help. I'm gonna use a little bit of
Laura Geller dew dreamer illuminating drops. This is a bit risky because I've never tried this before and I feel like with liquid highlighters
They either go one way or the other. This is in the shade gilded honey. I feel like gilded honey,
It's just a staple for everyone. Like everyone loves that highlighter. So they've brought out
Liquid highlighter drops of the same shade. So I'm gonna try, okay thing is though
I feel like my skin is already so glowy that I don't really want to add
Much more glow but I'm gonna give it a go anyway. So yeah
Let me know what types of videos you enjoy watching and you want to see I'm still gonna do.. I
don't know what's going on in the centre of my face
But stuff is just not blending out right.. I still want to do a obviously like makeup &amp;amp; fashion
Like I'm still gonna do testing video and like testing clothing videos
I've actually made an order on Oh Polly that I'm gonna do soon and like film that. Okay. I'm gonna do brows
So I'm going to use benefit precisely my brow pencil in the shade
Four. I've not been using dip brow as much recently because I feel like I prefer my brows to look a little bit more natural
Don't mind me, my knees just up here.
But yeah, I kind of never used to like using pencils because I feel like they're harder to control
I always just found them really difficult to like shape my brows with, but now that my brows are micro bladed
I think it's I think it's made it easier
I just start off with strokes and
then
at the tail I shape that a little bit more. So especially at the top because I feel like the top of my brow is
Where looks the most sparse. Me and Kane watched the purge last night
which I
always like refused to watch it because I thought it was gonna be really scary and I hate watching horror films where I
Feel like what's in the horror film could actually happen
Do you know I mean?
I feel like something like the purge, it wouldn't, but it's the sort of thing that could actually happen in real life
And that's what freaks me out. Well, we watched the first one and it wasn't bad
in terms of being scary
It wasn't that scary but it still made like a good thriller, which I like
What other horror film did we watch.. OH we went &amp;amp; watched recently 'a quiet place'?
which I don't know if it's out in the cinema anymore because it was released like a couple of
Months ago maybe, but it was so good
Like if that's on Netflix or Amazon or on sky or anything, 10 out of 10 would recommend
I love the actress that's in it as well. I can't know what she's called, but she's in uhm
girl on the train? I always get girl on the train and gone girl mixed up
But yeah, she's in girl on the train. She's so good
Okay, so I've got nothing to like clean my brows with in the sense that I've not got like a brush
that's small enough to clean them up. What other types of videos do I really like to watch.. I like people exploring
abandoned
and like haunted places, so
Does anyone watch on YouTube? Um
he's called Omar and I think his channel is called.. Omargosh. OmargoshTV. Yeah
His videos are so good. So toffee and Kane have come in with me today
Because it's a sat.. Is it a Saturday? Yes. It's a Saturday
And we're gonna take toffee out to the park and then go to the cinema later
So I was like, you know what just come along with me and Kane's helping me on this camera
but yeah, if you can hear a dog snoring that's Toffee
Can't even tell you how loud that dog snores at night like it gets out of control, honestly
So I've got this brush by it cosmetics and it's like a four in one, which I think is clever
so it's an angled brush one end and then you can basically adjust this and
it kind of.. hands are too slippy, but it
makes like different brushes
So you've got a short shader and smudger brush and then when you actually like roll it down
It gets into more of a blending brush, so
This is all I've got to do eyes. So
I'm hoping it comes through. So I've got it on the second setting
I'm just gonna dip into the actual palette that I'm using as a mirror, which is just my KKW
Contour palette. So this is in the shade light and I'm going to use this shade
I'm not gonna do anything too glam
Obviously because I'm really limited with what I can do and to be honest I didn't
Like, I didn't want to film this video to do like a full blown tutorial
It was more just for like a chat and a catch up. So I'm gonna go in with a palette. This is by Urban Decay
It's the beached eyeshadow palette. I think this is quite a new product for them. This is what it looks like in the pan
It's all just like really warm colors and then blues as well, which I just think is so
Cool for summer. It's only got one matte shade though
That's the only thing, I couldn't take this on
Holiday unless I took it with other palettes because there's literally only one matte shade and then the rest are
shimmers and
satins but these blues.. I feel like a warm crease and a blue lid is just such a thing like I love that
So I'm just going to use a little bit of daybreak
Which is the matte shade and then I don't really know what I'm gonna do
I'll probably just put some on my lid with my finger
But yeah, who else is everyone been watching it the minute? I'm obsessed with Shane Dawson like I watch all of Shane Dawson's videos
I'm going to leave that and then I'm just gonna use something on the lid
I quite like sixteenth Street, which is that one. I like heatwave as well. But that's quite dark
Hmm I'm gonna use heatwave. Oh, that is pretty
This is the thing with having nails like I can't get into my inner corner
Okay, so I'm just gonna put a little bit of the same shade
I think under the eye, or might just use the bronzer again
Because I've only got this same brush to do under the eye and it's a little bit big
I'm gonna do mascara and
Lips, so I'm just using iconic London
Mascara. I need to start putting lash serum back on my lashes
like I got into such a good habit not so long ago of doing like a full-blown skincare routine and I put
lush serum on in the evenings
And recently I've just been so lazy with it. Definitely very black, which is good
it's probably one of the blackest mascaras that I've ever used
Okay, I'm gonna do lips and then that's all I'm gonna do because I've generally got no powders
So I can't do.. well I've got no powder brushes so I can't do bronzer or anything like that
But we've done a little bit of cream. So for lips I've got the buxom plump line lipliner in the shade stealth
I've tried this before
and I do
Really like these so I'm just gonna line my lips with this and then in terms of an actual lip product
I've got the NYX powder puff lippy which is in the shade best buds
which I'm hoping is gonna match.. it looks kind of pinky, but I'm hoping it will do. And then in terms of
lipgloss we've got one buy inc.redible
Inc.redible? Is that how you say it? I think so and this gloss is so cute. Like I love the way
they've done this because it basically has three different tones and you can actually see in the container like the little
Division between each three shades. So this is one of the rainbow sparkle gloss
And it's called glass ceiling broken. I think it's called? So I'm gonna give that a go as well
So this is the finished look! I realise it's not the best makeup look I've ever done because I've genuinely not powdered. Um,
But I didn't really want this to be like a proper makeup tutorial
I kind of just wanted to sit down and have a chat with you all
so like I said
I am gonna do obviously more makeup tutorials now and like fashion videos and just get back into the swing of things and
Start uploading regularly again. I hope you like the new setup. Let me know what you think
I realized it's a little bit different but hopefully the lighting looks about and things like that
if you've got any feedback, then please tell me because I would love to know and
I hope you've enjoyed this video. I realized it's been a bit random and a bit all over the place, but
That's just me. So but yeah, I think that's everything. So, thank you so much for watching
I love you guys to the moon and back as always and I'll see you in the next one.
