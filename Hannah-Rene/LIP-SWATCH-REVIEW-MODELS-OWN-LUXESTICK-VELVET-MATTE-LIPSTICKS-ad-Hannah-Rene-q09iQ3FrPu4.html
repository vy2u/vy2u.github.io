going to be a lip swatch video which I'm
so excited about because I feel like
I've not done one in forever and I'm
pretty sure there's not actually one on
my channel anymore because I'm pretty
sure I took it down so I'm really
excited to be doing a new art so I've
actually teamed up with models own for
this video which if you've not heard of
models on before it's basically like an
affordable makeup brand they honestly
send like the biggest parcel of makeup
I've ever seen in my life I put it on my
snapchat if you don't have me on
snapchat going at me because I post all
the fun stuff on them but yeah this full
face of makeup is actually all models
own products as well which I thought was
really cool if you do want a tutorial on
this look then let me know and I can
like do I just to give you like a really
quick overview of some of the products
that I use and I use the belly bear
palette which looks like so on the
outside and then when I can open it and
then this is what it looks like inside
as you can see it's just like a
beautiful range of sort of neutrals
which I'm a neutral lover yeah I was
choosing between using this one and the
supernatural one but I went with this
one in the end and then just use like
the mattes in the crease and then use
the darker shade which is stark down
here and I did a kind of halo eyes so
it's like on my outer corner inner
corner and then on the lid is this shade
here which is a bear skin and then I
popped a little bit of naked on top you
can barely see I'm so sorry yeah those
are like the colors that then one of the
products that I used before the skin was
this palette here this is what's this
called this is the sculpt and glow
palette it's medium to tan 0/3 I will
link everything down below it's
basically got a bronzer blush and also a
highlighter so I have all three on my
cheeks I even use a blush which I rarely
wear blush anymore but it just looks so
pretty because it's like not too
intensely like colored if I make certain
like I said I will link all of those
products down below and if you want me
to do like a full video unlike the rest
of the look then I can also do that if
you would like me to today rather than
doing it just a makeup tutorial we're
going to be doing a lip swatch of all of
the new looks
stick lipsticks so they're very kindly
sent over four of the looks thick matte
lipsticks and then also four of the look
stick and velvet lipsticks as well
difference is pretty much in the name so
one of them is obviously a matte
lipstick and then the other one is more
like a velvet like glossy creamy finish
if that makes sense I'm pretty sure
there's about 20 of these also go though
but we're just going to swatch four of
each stages
that you can see like the range of
colors and the finishes and things like
that or it's actually an office starting
in February as well where if you spend
ten pounds either in a model's own store
or on the online website which I'm
pretty sure is model's own it com
possibly open it on the screen here yeah
if you spend ten pounds or more you can
get a free lipstick which is really cool
considering these are eight pounds each
so you got one for free if you spend ten
pounds if you want to use it in store
you can either go into the models own
store as I said it and then you spend
ten pounds or more and get a free
lipstick of your choice and if you wanna
use it online then you just shop put
everything in your cart and then you
apply the code looks ten again I'll have
it on the screen and in the description
bar because you know my memory is like
assumed so to sort of celebrate that
offer we thought we would do a video
where I could swatch a couple for year
and you can see if you want any for
yourself packaging is really cute as
well by the way it's like I'm very like
orange tipping yeah so I'm gonna start
with the four Velvets which have more of
like a creamy glossy finish so this is
what the lipstick bullet looks like it's
just like a really sleek sort of
marriage square container and then it's
got the shade on the bottom this first
one is in at the shade whisper and this
is just like a really beautiful sort of
baby pinky pink my description when it
comes to colors I swear to God it's
limited so we're gonna see how this goes
so I've pink that I would imagine would
look really nice and like this spring
and the summer time with like really
fresh skin because it's just it's not
too bright but it's not too like neutral
if that makes sense it's just like a
really beautiful maybe pink it's not too
cool or too warm yeah I feel like this
would make a really nice shade for
spring and summertime just want to say
as well the velvet ones feel so
comfortable when they're like gliding on
the lips like they're so comfortable to
apply it and the pigmentation is really
good we then have the shade 16 which is
called lullaby I will list all of like
the list of the lipstick names down
below as well in case you forget any or
you want to get any for yourself alibi
is quite similar but it's more like a
bright bubblegum pink in my opinion and
it's a little bit more cool toned as
well so it's really good at like making
your teeth look whiter and it is quite
like a bright pop of color I would say
again it would be like lovely in the
spring and summer time and but if you
want something that's more of like a pop
then I would go with this one and if you
want something more neutral and more
everyday I would go with the first one
which was whisper I believe we then have
the shade number 18 which is called
hello Hawaii which I love
because if you didn't know I went to
Hawaii last year and it was like my
favorite place ever shade is like a
really beautiful bright vibrant coral so
I got it be lovely in like the summer
time and this is a sort of color that I
love in like summer we like really
bronze like tan skin on holiday and like
really minimal eyes and just like this
pop on the lip I just feel like it looks
so flattering the sort of color as well
I feel flutters blue and green eyes so
beautifully because Carla's are like
orange you ready pinkies I would say and
I feel like it just really brings out
the color in your eyes if you've got
blue-green eyes and I found this one to
be like the most pigmented as well like
it just glided beautifully okay and then
this is probably my favorite shade out
of all of the Velvets this one is in the
shade at number 17
deep berry and as you can see it's just
like a really deep berry color hence the
name it's sort of like a cross between a
brown and a purple I would say so it's
not like a purple that's really like
intense and sort of bright in your face
but it's not like a brown where it's
like super dull it's kind of like a
really nice in-between which is what I
really love about it and again the
pigmentation it was lovely this one it
didn't apply as like smooth on my lips
but it just kind of clung to like the
dry patches on my lips because my lips
are so dry at the minute like at this
time of year it's an absolute nightmare
so I would say if you're gonna like use
one of the darker shades then maybe do
like a bit of a lip scrub at first so
those were the four Velvets onto the map
so the first of the MUX
is the shade zero one honey love and it
just looks like so it reminds me a lot
of whisper in the velvet ones which was
like the first one we did in the sense
that it's just sort of like a really
neutral like baby pink this one I say is
a little bit more neutral though so if
you want a shade that's like your lips
foot butter then this is like the
perfect lipstick for that just have like
a little bit more warmth in my opinion
as well so it's not as like cool or
bright it's more sort of like muted it's
like a really nice sort of muted rosy
pink literally just like in your lips
put better color I would say and then we
also have the shade 0-9 Oso nude which
looks like so this is quite a pale nude
so if you're someone like me who loves a
pale nude because you guys know I will
happily wear like a slightly darker lip
liner and then like a really pasty nude
like this in the center and I absolutely
love it I feel like it looks really
flattering it makes your lips look
really and juicy so if you similar to me
and you enjoy a pail new because you
feel like you can make it work with a
lip liner and stuff you will love this
next one is this one right here and this
is in the shade 0-5 cowl which again I
think is like the cutest name ever this
one I love purely for the fact that it
shows a really beautiful like classic
cherry red these are favorite types of
red for the summertime
I feel like this red that I've got on
which is the next one I'm going to show
I'd prepare these in like the colder
months where it's like awesome winter
because they're like a little bit darker
and a little bit more like Rumpy if you
like whereas this is a lot more sort of
vibrant and like in-your-face it's just
like a nice beautiful pop of red
lipstick as I have said about three
times and then the very last one which
is the one that I actually have on this
is the shade zero 7 my secret and it
just looks like so so this again is like
the darker one of the mattes
I love the color of it it's like a cool
tone sort of brownish toned red I would
say and these my favorite colors to wear
and like the wintertime as I just said
and they help to make you teeth look
whiter as well when it's like got a bit
more of like a cool tone as opposed to a
warm tone in a rad I just love it like I
just I have it on right now I just feel
like it looks again beautiful and like
medium skins but I feel like cool tone
Reds also look beautiful on fair skin
tones as well if I have to choose
between a cool and a warm right I'd
always go with a cool on just because I
don't know I feel like they just always
look flattering so yeah as I said this
offer runs until 28th of fat I believe
I'll put all of the details down below
with like the links and stuff like the
list of lipsticks and things like that I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
give it a massive thumbs up if you did

swatch videos and what other brands you
would like to see me lip swatch other
than that I don't think I have anything
else to say so thank you so so much for
