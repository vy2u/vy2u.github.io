you all well and having a lovely day
it's always so today's video is going to
be a medicine bear inspired makeup look
because I wanted to do like a celebrity
inspired makeup look for ages now and I
feel like Madison Bear she is absolutely
gorgeous like it kills me ok she's
absolutely stunning I love the way that
her makeup always looks it's always
really quite like natural but smoky at
the same time I just think she's
stunning like I'm obsessed with her so I
wanted to do a makeup look inspired by
her and kind of do a bit of a
transformation so I've done my hair
similar to how the picture is as well
this is the picture here if you want to
see it this is the look that we're doing
today so I've tried really hard to kind
of just mimic everything that's going on
in that picture with the hair and the
top and the makeup and stuff like that
so I really hope you all like it there's
any other celebrities that you want me
to do a similar video like this to you
then let me know I kind of want to do
Bella Hadid as well because I feel like
she's had some really pretty makeup
looks too so let me know this video is
actually in collaboration with kiss as
well which I'm so excited about so they
very kindly sent over their kiss lash
Patrol faux mink collection I've
obviously got a pair on right now this
is another pair as well I do show you
all the styles that they send over so
really excited to be using these these
are basically mink effect lashes so
really fluffy really voluminous but
obviously don't use mink hair which is
amazing I'm gonna go into a little bit
more detail when I actually apply these
and I show you how I apply my lashes as
well because I realized I don't always
do that in tutorials so we have a good
lash Chuck which I'm all for so yeah
thank you so much to kiss for wanting to
collaborate with me on this video I had
so much fun at wearing the lashes and
I'm obsessed obsessed with this style
I'm not gonna tell you which style it is
yeah what you'll see in the video so all
the information for that will be in the
description bar below and I think that's
it so without further ado if you want to
see how I achieve this makeup look then
it please just keep watching
okay so I've moisturize my skin we're
gonna do eyes first so I'm gonna start
off with brows so I'm gonna go in with
benefit precisely my brow pencil so in
terms of Medicine's brows I personally
think that they're quite arched so I
feel like her tail comes out pretty far
like pretty a pretty high angle if that
makes sense like higher than mine her
eyes just look a lot more
gated and have a little bit more of like
a cup-shaped vibe in my opinion I
absolutely love them I'm jealous of her
eyes let me just say to be honest having
your hair up does help anyway because
when you do like a really snatched pony
it does elongate your eyes and kind of
lifts them a little bit and that's
definitely the eye shape that she's got
so I'm gonna do my best to kind of mimic
the shape her tail it does come out a
little bit higher than mine it's kind of
more of like this sort of eye but I'm
just gonna do the best that I can and
I'm using a pencil because I just feel
like pencils look a little bit more
natural and her brows do look kind of
just natural and fluffy so I'm just
gonna start the tail section I'm just
doing it through the brow and like a
little bit underneath just to thicken it
a bit and then I'm gonna do a little bit
higher on the arch as well because her
brows do have quite a high arch and then
in terms of the tail I'm gonna make it
as high as I can without it looking like
too silly on my eyebrows so I'm gonna
kind of drag it out there so my natural
brow finish is a little bit lower but
I'm just gonna kind of get away while
try and get away with having it a bit
higher today so yeah as you can see I'm
just kind of tailing it out a little bit
her tail isn't that long anyway but I'm
just trying to make the most of making
my eyes look a little bit more elongated
and like upwards and then in terms of
the front again it just looks very
natural like it just looks like a
natural brow so I'm genuinely just
flicking the pencil through not doing
anything too crazy or too heavy going a
little bit lower right at the front
because I kind of want to create the
illusion of like an even higher arch
kind of looks like her brow kind of
design hers is a bit thicker at the
front to be honest I feel like that's a
good base that's a good base to start
off with so I'm just gonna do the same
on the other side and then because her
brows are a little bit on the thicker
look inside I'm just gonna go in with
gimme brow by benefit this is in the
shade 3 and I'm just gonna run this
through my brows just to add a little
bit more texture and hopefully make them
look a bit thicker it's just gonna set
them in place as well
ok so that is the rough shape of the
brows I'm just going to
my eyes with concealer and then we're
gonna move on to eyes so I'm just using
at the makeup revolution conceal and
define for this so I'm just applying
this all over the lid if you want to do
skin first and you absolutely could
because we're not gonna do much on the
eyes like she doesn't have a lot of eye
makeup on in the picture but I just find
it easier to do it this way and you just
want to use the brush and a bit of
concealer just to carve this out here I
might pluck those hairs as well because
they're just gonna annoy me okay and
then in terms of I makeup you just want
a palette that has neutrals and a black
and that's all you need so you don't
need any you don't need this one in
particular this is the morphe 25a but
literally anything that has a couple of
neutrals and a black will do eye makeup
is pretty minimal and I feel like it is
a lot of the time she always seems to
have like a similar vibe on the eyes by
the looks of it it's basically just like
a couple of neutrals or maybe even just
one neutral through the crease just for
like a little bit of definition and then
she always has a little bit of eyeliner
towards the outer part of the eyes just
to kind of lift you just want to take a
crease brush any brush will do let me
just make sure this one's clean my
brushes are never clean like I so whack
and then you just want to take any
transition color so I'm just gonna go in
with this one here it's just like a
medium warm brown you could even use a
bronzer like you could use just a
bronzer and then a black eyeshadow for
this but you just want to pop this in
the crease Oh once you kind of put the
product down you can do large movements
with the brush just just soften it so
I'm gonna take the Jojo Armani and liner
in the shade one this is just the
waterproof waterproof smooth silk eye
pencil I'm just going to use this to
tight lines so you just want to put this
like in the top waterline I'm not gonna
take it all the way in and just
concentrate in on the outer part because
what we're gonna try and achieve here is
elongated eyes which is what Madison's
eyes are like so you want to concentrate
like darker colors on the outer part I'm
not going to just kind of smoke them out
a little bit and then you want to take
an angle brush this one is just by
benefit and I'm just gonna dip into the
black from the morphe palette
we're gonna do this really slowly
because blacks obviously very intense we
don't have much else going on on the
eyes so I'm just gonna start on the very
outer corner and you just want to like
press this into the lashes so we're
gonna start low we're gonna start at the
lash line
the reason I'm doing shadow are not like
liquid liner or gel liner is because her
eyes never seem to have like a sharp
winger search it's more so just like
smudging us on the outer corner and then
what you want to do is you want to start
flicking it out a really tiny bit like
we're not gonna do a full-blown wing but
we're just gonna flick it out so that
we've got a little bit more length to
the eye just like that so you can see
already like the difference with this
eye on this side this I already looks a
little bit longer and like lifted
because of the flick even though it's a
really tiny flick it still does add a
lot of difference and it's up to you how
far in you take it it was hard to see on
the picture how far in she's taking the
black but I'm just gonna go pretty far
in because we are gonna do false lashes
so it'll just help to blend them so onto
lashes as I mentioned in the beginning
that this video is sponsored by kiss so
we're gonna be using the kiss lash
Couture faux mink lashes they very
kindly sent over three pairs for us to
choose from so this is the first pair
this is definitely the most dramatic
pass in the style Gala so it's very glam
very kind of dense and thick and
voluminous perfect for like a super glam
look and then we've got midnight which
is a little bit more natural than color
it's still kind of like a similar shade
quite full all the way around it's still
very thick and full and then the last
pair we've got is a little black dress
these are a little bit shorter in length
than the other two and they're also a
little bit more natural so yeah these
are mink effect lashes really voluminous
really soft but obviously don't use it
mink which is amazing and they actually
use a blend of lash materials to create
these so it's both human hair and
synthetic hair so they're basically
designed with multiple lengths multiple
pearls and multiple angles of different
lashes and they are tapered towards the
end as well so overall they give a
really full but natural look they're
also supposed to give it weightless
volume to be really comfortable on the
eyes as well which we will of course
test in a second and these are really
affordable that actually seven pound
nine
9 you can get them in stupid rug and
boots and you should be able to get
about 10 wears out of these which is
amazing so I feel like for 7 pound 99 to
be able to have a good set of lashes
that you can reuse at 10 times is
incredible the lash glue that we're
going to use with them is the kiss strip
lash adhesive with a low so this is a
lush adhesive with aloe infused into it
so yeah this is designed to be really
gentle on the eyes and not cause any
irritation but also keep your lashes on
all day long all night long we all want
that it's 3 pounds 29 and you can get
this in a boot so I'll link all the
styles and the glue down below if you're
interested so yeah this is what it looks
like in the packaging it's just like a
squeezy tube which is really easy to use
so this is what they look like out of
the pocket they also have a nut-free
lash band as well so it's practically
invisible on the eyes which is amazing
so I'm actually going to use the style
midnight because I feel like we can get
away with a little bit more of a bolder
like thicker lash for this the first
thing I do actually is just snip the
very inner part because that's always a
bit longer
and then you just want to cut from the
outside okay and then all you want to do
is just apply the glue directly to it
the lash band and then we're gonna wait
about 30 seconds for it to dry so it
should look like that you can see the
last ones now white from where the glue
is and then I always put the lash in the
middle there so I just put it in the
middle of my lash line and then I'm
gonna stick the outside corner down
first and then you leave the inner
corner to the very last just so that's
extra tacky and it's not gonna make your
eyes water and then you just want to go
down and like clamp your natural lashes
and the falsies together it will
actually so easy to put on because the
lash bone is really thin like they just
fit on like so quickly just feel super
lightweight they're really easy to put
on so those are the eyes done for now
I'm gonna move on to skin okay so for
skin I'm gonna prime it with the
Illamasqua hydro veil absolutely love
this primer really hydrating on the skin
so it's a little bit difficult to apply
that's the only thing with this so you
kind of have to like scoop it out cuz it
feels a bit like jelly and then just
trying to stick it to the skin before it
falls so hot and then the foundation
that I'm gonna use is the Giorgio Armani
power fabric I'm in the shade 6 so this
is kind of like a full coverage
foundation the reason I'm using it is
because
in the photo medicines skin looks really
flawless and it looks a little bit chewy
and even though this is a matte
foundation it's kind of like a satin
which I feel is kind of similar to what
she's got going on it's good looks
really flawless but it still looks like
skin and I feel like that's what you
achieve with this foundation you guys
know I love it I've used it so many
times it was a little bit darker but I
do have fates hands still on my neck and
I don't actually own a lighter shade in
this so we're just gonna have to make do
Madison is quite tanned in the photo as
well so I kind of want to replicate that
so as you can see it's got a bit of a
glow but it's gonna kind of set down a
bit as well this is such a good
foundation brush honestly like this and
then morphe and for 39 and my favorite
brushes for this foundation so for
concealer I'm just going to use the same
one that I used to prime my eyes it's
just the makeup revolution conceal and
define this is in the shade c7 so just
gonna pop this on madison's under eyes
don't look too highlighted so I feel
like this shade isn't too bright because
hers definitely aren't like a super
highlighted under eye okay so as you can
see it's brightens but it's not super
bright so let's just highlight it a
little bit I'm gonna set it with Rimmel
stay matte so I'm just gonna use brush
and then pack that on and then you just
want to set the skin with the same
powder the bronzer that I'm gonna use in
terms of bronzer like a skin it looks
really warm and glowy and bronzy doesn't
look too heavily contoured I would say
if you like her cheekbones have a little
bit of contouring on the go but overall
she just looks quite bronzy so I'm just
gonna use a chocolate soleil by Too
Faced and I'm just gonna use my buck
sage Beauty brush so I'm just gonna kind
of Pat this on the cheekbones she
doesn't look like she's got any blush on
but it looks like the bronzer has been
kind of taken up a little bit so it kind
of acts as blush as well Madison's got a
much smaller like lower face section
than me like she's got a smaller chain
and
smaller jawline than me so I'm just
gonna Bruns quite heavily here as well
just to kind of shrink that a bit again
she's got a bit of a smaller forehead
than me I feel like a face in general is
quite small so I'm just gonna brunt a
little bit more than I usually were just
to kind of try and mimic that I mean
I've got five head on the go here so
we're gonna do what we can okay okay so
her nose in particular she's got a very
petite nose she has a lot more of a
button nose than me so it's a little bit
more raised I would say like the tip of
her nose is a little bit more raised
than mine so the way that we're gonna
kind of copy that a little bit is just
by contouring and just like I've been a
little bit of bronzer underneath we're
gonna contour the sides a little bit I
feel like her nose it's a tiny bit
slimmer than mine I'm just gonna carry
it up into socket a bit we're gonna add
a little bit here make my nose look a
bit more lifted I'm gonna blend all this
out I thought no light Li blend that in
nose contour Ian's like not my strong
point to be honest like I'm not a pro at
it so that will have to do that is the
extent of what I can do okay I got a lot
of freckles in the photo I think yeah by
the looks of it she's got a lot of
freckles on the go so I'm just gonna try
and draw some fake ones on I do have a
couple on my nose anyway in hers kind of
in a nose and like under-eye section
like spreading out towards our cheeks so
we're just gonna use benefit precisely
my brow and I'm just gonna start going
humble with the freckles so I'm just
using really light pressure
I'm just like really toughing it out
feel like on camera you can't really see
them but they definitely are there I
promise you that so I've done the best
that I can and just done them like
around my cheeks and stuff gonna move
back on so you under eyes I'm just gonna
take the same shade as it like a
transition kind of just to blend under
that eyes and I'm just gonna start on
the outer corner and move inwards in the
picture Madison has like a little bit of
a smoky under-eye like it looks like
she's got a little bit of liner or black
shadow pressed up against the lashes so
I'm just gonna use this first just to
give us a base and then I'm just gonna
use the same benefit brush and I'm just
gonna push this up at the very outer
part of the lashes she doesn't have this
going all the way in it kind of comes to
about halfway in so I'm gonna do the
same I'm also gonna take the black
eyeliner and put that in the water line
at the very outer part of the lashes
again it's just gonna link up with like
the top like the tight line you just
want to do at lower lash mascara to tie
all of it together I'm gonna highlight
ever so slightly I'm just gonna use the
L'Oreal foils highlighter just on the
very top of the cheekbone doesn't look
like she has a super intense highlight
on so I'm just gonna use a little bit
and then I'm just gonna take a really
slim brush I'm just gonna put a tiny bit
on the center of the nose and again not
just gonna pull the nose together a
little bit you also want to do a tiny
tiny bit on the tip
that's gonna again give us like a lifted
tip like what Madison's got in terms of
lips she's got really lovely kind of
full up plump lips she never really
seems to have a lot on them it kind of
is recycle your lips but better color so
I picked out two liners by nude Stix
we've got baby Kay and month tan yeah
one thing so I want something like pinky
but I don't feel like that's too pink
okay that's about right so that's kind
of like a your lips but better color so
this is the Montana you on that I can't
pronounce so I'm just gonna line them
and then fill them in a little bit I'm
not gonna do it too heavy I'm gonna over
line this Center because her lips are
very plump in the center so they're
quite shows quite a plump awful lip at
the top of the lip and then the same at
the bottom and then they kind of come
down less full and not in like the outer
portion with the bottom lip as well I
always do this with any lip liner and
any time I do my makeup but you can
always like really underline you bottom
lip because you don't see it when your
lips are like open anyway like when
you're talking and stuff you don't see
it on the skin but you can really
underline and that just creates like a
natural shadow and makes the lips look
plump up
okay so I've just blended it a little
bit in the center as well she doesn't
have a glass on she always just looks
like she's got a really natural lip on
the go so I'm not gonna do anything
other than that obviously if we wanted
to set this in place so I'm just gonna
use the model zone at one-night-stand
setting spray okay so this pretty much
concludes there's a Madison beer
inspired makeup look I really hope you
all enjoyed it thank you so much again
to kiss for sponsoring this video I'll
leave all the details to the lashes and
the glue it down below if you're

it looks relatively similar to Madison's
look I feel like I've got it as close as
I could get it yeah I'm pretty happy
with it and this is the sort of makeup
that I would wear on like a day to day
basis anyway so I really hope you all
