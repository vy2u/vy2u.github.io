this is going to go on my main channel
but today's video is going to be a
makeup collection and a sort of
declutter because I have been one into
like get rid of a bunch of stuff for so
long now and I'm just about getting
around to doing it so I feel like I'm
not filmed in ages and I just know that
this is going to take me ages I have
actually started a lot of it here and so
I kind of like group things together so
this is all stuff that needs to be like
given away or basically I don't not to
do with a lot of stuff which is why I'm
going to ask you because when I
mentioned that I was in video and
Twitter a lot of people said do a
giveaway and then a couple of people
said it do a giveaway but also maybe put
some stuff on teapots so that because
obviously with a giveaway like there's
usually a couple of winners and you
can't really like choose to have the
stuff if you're not mean like if I put
some stuff on do pot then you can buy it
if you want it sort of thing or is
actually a charity called given makeup I
believe which is like a women's charity
and you can actually donate makeup there
which I I think it's the only choice I
know that you can actually donate makeup
to and so anything that I don't like
giveaway off cell will probably let go
to that charity what I'm going to do is
I'm going to pin a comment in the
section so like when you scroll down
into the comment section there will be a
pinned comment let me know what you want
me to do as I'm going through this
obviously this is only some of the stuff
like you have no idea how much makeup
I'm getting rid of I'm going to be so
strict on myself and let me know if you
want me to sup like let me know there's
anything you want me to sell that you
see and let me know what you think would
work well as a giveaway things like that
and then anything that slight left over
we'll just go such heresy and that's
pretty much it I mean I do you like my
makeup collection and show you around
that and then I'm going to sort of like
I'm not going to film too much as a
declutter because container ages this is
my actual desk area so pretty much
everything I'm going to link my last
makeup collection down below because all
of their furniture I mean all of this
stuff like the white stuff is IKEA of
course and I'll link the backdrop this
is like the backdrop with the standard
things I don't know why that's like yeah
that's like my backdrops and things so
I'll link just refer that down below
but in terms of everything else if you
want to know like for example where this
is from and like my containers and job
I'll just leave a link to my life
make up collection down below because
it's pretty much all the same furniture
and that's got all of the links in there
these light up letters I got them from a
garden center I actually got them from
Ben's if anyone lives in like salsas
area I guess I got them from banks I
don't know the name of the company that
I got them from but if you just search
like light-up letters on eBay or
something or on Etsy
you'll find something similar yeah this
is the stuff that's always on the top of
the desk so I have brush parts these are
just from Ikea and these are all like my
large brushes like my face brushes and
things and then I have a part this is
that chick from Paper Chase this latakia
this is just got eye pencils in so like
eyeliners and things like that and then
it's just got this is the brush that I
use when I shaved my hairline sounds
really odd and I keep that in there
because it's like it kind of classes as
like an eye product because I use it
with eyeshadow and this one is a smaller
part but as you can see it does have
like some face brushes in and that's
because I basically keep all of my
favorite brushes in there so all of the
face brushes that I reach for a lot and
so I've got my morphe one my m4 5/9 this
is the burst I use a lot of foundation I
get questions on which is the look-see
large angled brush and then these are
just the rest of my eye brushes so just
like a mix of like Sigma and backstage
beauty and Mac pretty much so this I
have been loving like it's so handy
because I have a lot of palettes which I
am going to declutter a lot of them and
but I keep them in the drawers here and
it's kind of like the way they're
organized like I just don't like it
because you can't really see them very
well so I got this off eBay this is by
bio allegory that's how you say it so
I'll try and like it down below it's the
same stuff as like my lipstick and my
lip my lip glass holders sorry up there
and it's not too expensive I think it
was about 25 pounds or so and it just
holds like pallets and pallets and these
little inserts are removable as well so
you can take them out these are like all
of my mouth shoes palette so I have my
Anastasia cream contour and this is
actually a new palette from Anastasia
like the new shadows
I just keep that there because it
reminds me to use it and my Mac blush
palette oh my goodness if anyone knows
me you know how much I love using Mac
blushes as eyeshadows if you are really
into makeup and you love warm eyeshadows
like these Reds for example they're so
hard to find
actual eye shadows but marked as so many
blushes as options so it's really worth
getting a blush palette with like well
it's technically an eyeshadow palette we
just got a blush insert and then just
pick in like six shades because they're
so good and then I've got my modern
Renaissance which is probably my most
used palette like if there's any is ever
a palette like if anyone ever asked me
like watching my shoes palette and what
do I need I always say this because
honestly it's incredible as I said to do
other so on down there so hey and what a
beauty I'm not really use that as much
but I keep it there because I do want to
give it a proper try thing like I've not
really properly tried it yeah and Kat
Von D shade and light palette the only
reason I keep this here is because it's
got a good black in it and I not a
massive fan of like the palette itself I
find like the eyeshadow struggle sublime
sometimes I don't know if it's just mine
I do keep it there because the blacks
good and like the matte like whites and
stuff are quite handy sometimes at the
Nicole glow care my violet vast Holy
Grail Too Faced chocolate bar and I love
my Too Faced palettes I do forget to use
them a lot because I've sticks like my
Anasazi and stuff but it's nice to have
enough when I remember and my ultimate
glow care and judge me palette by
Jeffrey's are probably the best
eyeshadows over try like they just
they're in say and they really are and
then my makeup geek palette at the back
which if you want to know everything
that's in this palette I will leave a
link to the video down below where I go
through all the shades again it's
essential to me like it's just such it's
got everything in honestly this is the
first drawer of my Alex tour so this is
all skincare and like primers and things
like that
I also have settings raised along the
side as well so I've just got my Urban
Decay which is my favorite of all time
it's amazing I'm a toucher luminous dewy
skin mess which I don't really use when
I'm doing makeup but I like it on no
makeup days to just like add a bit of
luminosity to the skin and my Rimmel and
insta-fix and then I've got a
moisturizer here by Sunday Riley I'm
obsessed with this I'm going to save it
for a favorites video to speak right
probably but it's incredible and all
this is primers so this will be having a
thorough declutter because like honestly
I probably sticks like this front
complete compartment and then I kind of
just forget about everything in the back
I do love my Marc Jacobs like that's
just in there because it doesn't really
fit in the front and
still have my Libyan men honestly what
these males are vile they and then this
is quite an interesting job because this
is like my holy grail drawer I genuinely
when I moved into this fire I genuinely
made like a Holy Grail job because I I
don't know I just felt like it was so
honey to have everything that I love in
one draw yeah just genuinely has all my
favorite products for my favorite
foundation and Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
stick you will know I'm obsessed with it
it's amazing it's why I've gotten it
today and I've got the liquid one there
as well because I mix it with this
backer one which is the ultimate
coverage I do like that but if you don't
and it's drying it's like Superman I
have pretty much all my concealers they
are all my favorite concealers and so
Tuesday's Maybelline and makeup rather
this one is good but it's really six
with you have dry skin it's not the best
under eyes like I have to mix it with
the Too Faced one but then it's fine and
I have my starlet in the shade at 13 I
think this is yeah this is just like
such a pretty like champagne color as
you can see like it's perfect for
highlight like even on the sheet lower
lash curlers and other random concealers
that I have my palette which I never
knew how much I would value having a
palette it's really handy or their
iconic drops which I recently got and
then I've got my Laura Mercier was
actually an RCM a powder in Virginia and
I have my L'Oreal face oil because it's
so good at mixing in with like cream
products like the Anastacio console Ken
Stahl I have my favorite nail varnish
which is my death bear by models own
such a pretty color like it's the
perfect kind of nude Lily lashes and
then I have some amber rose rushes back
there and iconic London brush and I
Jesse star highlighters which I do
really like I think they're great on the
face
they swatch really badly but they look
really good on the skin removed a map
makeup wipes which I keep in there just
for essentials and a soft ochre by Mac
in the back which I don't use as much
and then just my makeup forever
highlighter and bronzer which are my
favorite so this drawer will not be
declawed because it literally has
everything that's my fave in and then
this jar is so I just love to look at it
sure I love it so much so this is my lip
drawer and obviously I have more lip
products in this but I am this is kind
of like my favorites and things that I
want to keep other than the urban decay
liquid lipsticks in the backpack I feel
like hey I'm going to declutter these
because there's some
I just won't reach for I to face ones I
like some of my favorite liquid
lipsticks I think they're incredible and
I've got the new well I don't think
these are new anymore but the benefit
kind of lip liner and lip products in
wand to face like the peach these like
the oil lip glosses really lovely as
well it's a Mac ones some makeup forever
just things like that and so a lot of
this will today and this insert is
actually a lipstick holder bye bye
allegory as well and but as you can see
it has quite large like um like slots if
that makes sense
so I'll link it down below again if you
are interested but I pretty much just
slot two of each product into it and it
just kind of like fit quite well
lipsticks is just like some random stuff
down the bottom so Make Up For Ever
somewhat checklist are my jeffree star
I'm nude smells disgusting like I don't
know what that's about with the actual
colors really nice so it's quite good I
mean max stuff like come out limited
edition so this is like Cinderella and
things like that
and then I basically have to Mooji
inserts that have my nude lip pencils
and then my darker ones so I just like
things like pinks and reds and
burgandy's and things like that and then
this one has my mark liquid lipsticks I
like my retro a lot and there's two
Charlotte Tilbury at lip glosses my G a
skinny dip and frostbite toppers
absolutely love them these are by the
balm again little lipsticks and L'Oreal
and then some Marc Jacobs in the back so
I will go through this a little bit but
I do I will probably keep the majority
of it because this is stuff that I reach
for like quite a bit as well I guess and
then this is just excess lip products so
I've got lip pellets down here as well
so I have my Anastasia I can't actually
go out but my Anastacio and lip palette
at the back and then I have some
Maybelline one's got some more liquid
lipstick so these are by UT bakery which
I don't really reach for I probably get
rid of these to be honest and I've got
some what a beauty wines and some gerra
cosmetics which again I don't really
reach for and these are all sleek I
think and then there's some Rimmel here
and some mini glasses here so there's
interface and some Sigma this is on the
other side now so this will gap this has
kind of already been declawed
a lot of it is on the bed there which is
like the random stuff like the next
pigments and the Milani eyeshadows and
but this is like my I draw so I have it
liquid well I think this is liquid
liners yeah so liquid liners and like
gel liners and pencils and things down
and I have a random things in here which
are just like pencils and the Stila and
what these called again the Magnificent
metals I think and you actually have a
couple more of those so they will get
tucked in
there but yeah so much is organized
right and then that is all mascara so I
did actually have a massive mascara
clean-out because I had to weigh to
money and for someone who doesn't wear
mascara that much I just didn't need
them so I just kept ones that I know
that I like and then I've got some
palettes on the side which just keep
these insert Caesar from Muji it just
keeps them from like sliding about as
much so there's just like a YSL brow kit
at brow Wiz by benefit and the Smashbox
and like these are called but the little
eyeshadow palettes that they brought out
and then a Too Faced natural eyes I
think that in this collection has all my
brows stuff which is pretty much benefit
like I love benefit brow stuff like they
do such good products and then have some
uh nostalgia stuff in that as well
that soap &amp;amp; Glory which I'm yet to try
just like random bits and pieces and
then in the back is just like mini
mascaras and like mini products that
just didn't have a home I guess so yeah
and a benefit in here a roller lash and
Minnie and Too Faced better than sex my
Apple seal by Makeup Forever which is a
really handy product to basically just
like waterproof and liquefies like
pretty much any product and then this
jar has always been like my favorite
drawer in my makeup collection because I
just love the way it looks and what this
does need a good clean-out because I
don't really use a lot of stuff in here
so this is all my extra like bronzers
blushes and highlighters which aren't
like elsewhere or I have some benefit
oils down here these are California the
new blush incredible a hula I think this
is hula light actually yeah and then a
dandelion highlighter I've got all of my
Mac ones here which I have to say like
Mac products even though I don't always
reach for them a lot they are quite like
nostalgic for me they I don't know they
just remind me of like when I first got
into makeup because Mac was
first brand that I loved himself and
obviously I used to work that and having
my job there I was like such an
achievements me so even though I don't
use a lot of the stuff like I probably
will keep it just because it has like
such a special place in my heart that
makes them yeah these are like mac
mineralize and then just normal Mac
blushes and then some of them are
limited edition and then the rest is
just normal again since it again is
bye-bye allegory and there's a better
highlight at Tom for blush Gucci Hugh a
highlighter I mean okay it's open gory
bronzer incredible I use it today solar
powder it's one of my favorite brands
it's amazing and then just my mary-lou
which is again an oldie but a goodie of
mine when my favorite and then my Shem
this is my Prosecco pop and amaretto
Lanigan let's just running stuff in the
back so these amok I'm like limit
edition and random bits and pieces I
can't really pull like it forward
because it goes right into the back of
the drawer it's like fully open and I've
got some wells that I got here just like
makeup geek stuff Rimmel stuff L'Oreal
scoffs and Becca blushes NAS bushings I
do really like nice brushes I think nods
blushes it's hurry I think that amazing
and and then some tart blushes in the
back to some like bits and pieces so
it's going to break my heart but this
needs as good clients because I don't
use a lot of this stuff so I will have a
good clean-out of that and that is
pretty much it like this is everything
those are all the drawers that are full
in this section of my roof is the
associate next to the desk which has
pretty much everything else in it so
these containers on its top are from
Amazon again I'm pretty sure they're
linked in my last makeup collection so
as I said the link for that will be down
below and but they're just clear acrylic
boxes like if you type it in on Amazon
you'll find tons of options as well so I
have one that has five drawers and then
one that has six drawers and has a bit
of a skinny at draw at the top and then
all of these lip gloss containers as I
said our filmic by allegory again I
think they're about 20 pounds like 15
pounds I would say so the first one it
just has all of my Kylie stuff I'd like
to keep it all in one place because
obviously they come with the lip liners
like the lip kits so that is all
like so there so they just kind of going
to know to kind of I don't really know
and then I just have the glasses at the
front so these two were from the crib
the Christmas collection and then the
rest are just the normal ones and then
at the top at the back I have all my
anastasi stuff well I have two lots of
uh Nastasia lip holders so these are
pretty much all of the lip glosses these
ones are pretty much liquid lipsticks
and then a few more glasses at the back
so there's all of the news at the front
and then it pretty much has this one
holds the products that I use the most
and then that has like darker glasses
and things as well and then this little
container was in my last collection as
well again it's um Amazon it was a
little bit more pricey but I really just
wanted one because I just think that's
so cool so I wanted one to just hold
some of my more like high-end lipsticks
so I have all of my mark ones which
after say again I don't reach for them
as much I do have one on today and I
have one of the Maya ones on because the
stuff at the top is like from the mariah
carey collection because i feel like it
has to be unsure like it's so glum all
of my YSL at lipsticks as well so i've
got my two shoots not matter shukla I
think they're the Rouge fill up today
I'm pretty sure that's how you say it
and then I've got some of the other ones
at the bottom and then these they've
recently brought out for some other like
lip they're kind of like the Vil up days
but they also have lip balm in them
they're really cute and then onto the
first acrylic box so the very top drawer
I love the straw it's like one of my
favorite drawers because it has all of
my well not all of my book it contains
all makeup rather and products so at the
front we have single eyeshadows which
single eyeshadows by makeup ever
absolutely incredible you kind of make
them into pellets as well and what that
eyeshadows are amazing and then there's
a starlet liquids at the front which are
from the new style at range so they
brought out liquids and then the powders
which I like the ones that I showed in
that drawer and I've got some of the
artist acrylic lips in the back which
are all really fun bright colors and
then I just have and I probably will get
rid of this this is the Ultra HD powder
which I'm not personally funneled like I
don't like it at all and I have a couple
of start profusion as well so I just
like to keep all about there because
makeup forever one of my favorite brands
and I love working with in like this
such an incredible team so that is all
of those goodies this drawer
had for quite a while now like it's
always been like this so this is my
compacts of things like my bubbly brown
shimmer bricks and I have a bubbly Brown
at brands that Bobby Palin Franza
as a muscle and then my Mac mineralize
skinfinish is at the front which I have
and FIFA Bruns in and then one for just
like normal
face powder this is kind of like a
random draw this just has again compacts
and things like that so it's got and
Make Up For Ever Pro run fusion which my
favorite brands ever it's incredible
it's a bit of a lighter shade and then
I've got a revolution at vivid beige
highlighter and then a Mac cow blend
powder which I use as a bronzer a
two-faced bronzer from Cinderella
limited edition muck in the back and
then a mineralized and which is a soft
and gentle which again I don't like I do
not like soft and gentle but it's one of
bits right here is one of the first
products I ever bought like in terms of
makeup and so obviously like I keep it
just again like for kind of place in my
heart the tube is kind of like a urban
decay beach bronzer and then some random
bits like silk and glowing make up
forevers in the back for the pretty
empty drawer at the minute this just has
to understand your blush palettes which
again I'll probably give some of these
away or sell them again let me know what
you want me to do with them and then a
master bronze in the box just because
there's quite an interesting rate of
range of shades that I just like won't
use but the actual products is lovely
and this I love this jar like it's so
fun to look at and I love the way to
organize because it all fits perfectly
and but this is just like pigments and
things like that loose glitters I have
all my muck glitters in the back side
probably my favorite glitters I could
just think they're amazing and my
Maybelline tattoos honestly if you've
been watching my channel a while you'll
remember these back for you some L'Oreal
infallible eyeshadows I have all of
these that again I don't really use them
a lot anymore but they kind of just have
a place to maja have next vivid bright
here and I have to cut a bit of this job
because I made room for the next stuff
and then there's just some like makeup
eat pigments and things like that in the
back this is what the top the top drawer
looks like sorry so it's all just like
mini glosses and things that fit well in
the drawer and so I've got my NYX and
soft matte lip creams Cairo is my
favorite absolutely love it and some
mini Mac lip glosses it's open gory
mark pokeballs at the back which I don't
think they do news anymore but I love
them and then some at Smashbox some it's
a Gucci like what the hell yeah these
are Gucci and then just some mutts sleek
liquid lipsticks again this show it's
basically for things that didn't have a
home well through that these lip
products at the front which are YSL Tom
Ford dear and then Lancome they're all
quite bulky lip products which is why
they're in here because they don't
actually fit into and the lipstick
holders that I have because they're so
like chunky so I keep those in here
because they don't fit anywhere else and
then I've just got to blow kits by
understudy in the back in the back sorry
I've got moonchild and Aurora and these
next two dolls are all just like mini
palettes so this one is just a mix of
like eyeshadow palette so like the
Mariah Cinderella and sleek palette
smash like a Sarah Smashbox palette and
some next some marks just like random
stuff L'Oreal things like that and then
this one was supposed to be more so face
like highlighting so stuff like my sweet
and my lip products by L'Oreal and
passage out you know her blush oh my
gosh color myself wait so the camera
just cut off and I can't remote are
saying well yeah this just has a bunch
of like packaged soft these are actually
spares some array of stuff and but I
think I'm going to save them for like a
more special giveaway because obviously
the limited edition they're gone now and
but that is everything in that drawer is
the very last shot at the back there are
some cosmic metals by NYX which are
lovely but I do not use them so I will
be getting rid of those and then I just
have some like Mac products like liquid
liners and just like random single
shadows and stuff and then I just have
all my sisters by Mac in here and then
these first two drawers of the actual
like tall Alex show sorry and these are
all skincare so there's just like a mix
of stuff in here okay they started out
this is a bit of Mathew draw again it
needs organizing this side out is like a
draw for palettes that are too big to go
in the drawer underneath so I use one of
the deeper drawers for like stacking
palettes and but some of them were too
big so for example my other makeup geek
palette i'm morphe palette and my Kat
Von D mi vida loca which is our like my
the wheel palette I just thought it's
too big it went in there and then I have
my actual like palette drawer here which
as I said I don't think I ever go in the
drawer
like ever I don't think I actually ever
use it because I have all my essential
palettes over there but like my back
face palette with like the collaboration
with Jaclyn hill I'm going to keep this
this is my oh gee like mark blush
palette it's got my very first margin in
which I actually do put myself again a
very special palette for me super stuff
I will cue because I do use that but
then things like like I have a bunch of
mark palettes here again
Mac's kind of funny like even though I
don't use it I do like to keep it so
I'll probably keep those because I like
my first palette and but there's things
like my ethnicity nakeds
I never used so I'm like pardon me wants
to keep them because again is from the
first site say about owns but part of
them's like odd or really need them I
don't really know okay and then this jaw
is this is basically a drawer where I
just put things in that I don't know
whether to keep or I don't know like if
they're going to have a home and it's
basically it's usually new stuff like
stuff that's very kindly been sent over
by brands and things like that so I have
a lot of anastasi stuff in here at the
minute from like the massive and PR
posilutely sent over I honestly melted
when that came because I was just like
how a lot of that is in here this might
make up for ever HD powders to be honest
a lot of this will be given away how
could I forget this shot so this is like
excess face products like skincare not
skincare sorry what base products like
foundation self which again don't have a
home in these shores because they're not
essential so I have a stab back to
foundation here my L'Oreal Lumi magique
which is one my favorites I will keep
that and I have some w7 stuff in that
from when I did the video that other
weeks just like primers random like
basically everything that's like a face
product which isn't in another drawer is
in here so I feel like I've been
speaking to so long now my camera is
honestly over here at about five times
it keeps like switching off because it's
my blog camera like it's not used to me
filming like so much on it and but I'm
going to start going through a bridge on
our I've pretty much done everything
here and so I pulled out like all the
skin cast off and all the lip products
are you can see and all that I'm not
going to use to be honest I actually
have got rid of a lot
more lip products and Nestle I was this
so much it's pretty much all of the
benefit and there's a lot there's pretty
much all of the Urban Decay vice there's
a lot of the two-faced
like lip oils and then I've got rid of
some blushes and stuff up there so I
don't know I feel like sorry see I'm
just going to go and do it the rest of
the drawers now I'm just like watch it
all on the bed and throw it out
afterwards
okay so I've pretty much gone through
all the drawers now sorry I keep cutting
like the top of my head off I've been
thinking it to be honest I might do like
most of it as giveaways if I do giveaway
sell probably on probably be on Twitter
just because it's the easiest way to do
them or Instagram and which it's free to
download them and my usernames just an
extra note if you don't have it these
are as I showed you before the next
foundations that like the darker shades
I picked out some of the Smashbox
lipsticks as well they're a little bit
darker and this ultra HD powder by Make
Up For Ever is designed for darker skin
tones because it's in the darker shade
and so I might do that as a giveaway on
Twitter and maybe I'd like a couple of
more things in if I find anything over
there that's like suitable for like
darker skin and we've got the medium
ones here there's more fair ones there
all this benefit stuff and I've pulled
out all of the benefit lip products as
well because I'm not and I don't use
those but the Smashbox stuff here like I
said if there's anything you see that
like I don't know if you just have ways
that you think you'd want this as
giveaways always like if you want
anything on depop just let me know in
the comments because like it's going to
take me ages to get really my best with
everything and but yeah all of these are
like the duo's some scream cluster from
benefit and then obviously this is all
just like the random stuff and mighty
Urban Decay vice palettes which the
thing will use makeup is like I don't
really like to give it away so I feel
like they should probably go in deeper
down here it's like a bunch of stuff
that I pulled out of this jar I have
left some of it in because some of it
I'm going to say for like testing videos
and like full face first impressions and
but I have a bunch of wake me up by
Rimmel because obviously like I did a
shoot with Rimmel not so long ago so
I'll actually have about 10 of the Kate
contour Hollis and like to really shades
on which is just like getting rid of all
of them so that I only have like one as
average they pulled out all of the NYX
soft matte lip creams which I'll
probably give these away
as like a bundle and then like I said is
a bunch of urban decay stuff over here
which I'm just getting rid of because or
given away sorry because their shades
that I just wouldn't wear like bright
pink something I hope you've enjoyed
this video I feel like it's been a
little bit all over the place and a
little bit messy and in fact I'll
quickly show you the drawers like
quickly skim over them so that you can
see what they look like now that I do
close that is the primer draw it only
goes up to there now so I've just
decluttered everything and I just got my
favorite primers in my favorite like
settings raising micellar waters that
that draws obviously the same because it
had all my like Holy Grail stuff and and
this is the lip product so far so as you
can see like this was pretty full before
and it's all like out here now and I
have kept a lot of this just because it
was in here because I how using what not
this one which is again lip store and
it's pretty empty as well now I don't
know to at the sleek stuff yeah I do
like to keep some like drugstore lip
products even if I don't use them a lot
such as good for videos and but we'll
see this drawer was the same so that is
the eyes and then that is the blush
which I know still looks very full but
like it was right to the back so I feel
like I've done an okay job I was like I
said I'm going to keep a lot of my Mac
stuff for now just because it's like Mac
and whatnot but that is pretty much all
that stuff that's a foundation so that
some do cause quite a fair bit obviously
they're still in there and I'm just
going to like declutter more if needs to
be so I'll just kept what I know that I
like and lashes I'm not contrary because
like I will like get through lucious
does that make sense and and then yeah
so I pretty much just John at that
palette jaw is empty now this is what's
left of the palette so this is pretty
much everything like it was right to the
back before and now it's just like a row
and one couple is stuck so I kept the
Naked palette for now because like I
said that some of my first palettes so I
feel like they're nice to keep my Mac
wounds from Kylie stars just like random
bits and bobs and what those are so and
that's pretty much it
so I hope you enjoyed this video I feel
like it's been really long sometimes it
got like boring along the way and that
is my makeup collection I like my
storage and stuff and pretty much
everything that I'm decluttering so like
I said it let me know what you want me
to do with it
and I'm probably going to start
organizing a little giveaways and stuff

going to go up tomorrow this video so I
probably start like organizing some bits
anyway but yeah thank you so much for
