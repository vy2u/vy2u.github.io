again with my bestie a Rachel Marron so
we are filming another collab before
2017 it comes around because we thought
it was about time I don't even know when
we did the last alone I feel like it
might have been this time last year
no is this year definitely anyway we
thought we would film we basically asked
on Twitter what you guys want to see and
the majority people asked me to do
Rachel's makeup and then Rache to do my
makeup so this video is me doing
Rachel's makeup so with this look right
here and and then if you enjoyed this
and you want to go and see the other one
I will leave a link to roaches down
below where she does this makeup look
right here which as you can see I'm
hoping my mention but I've dyed my hair
I mean brooches on hers as well we base
my eye so on I know you can tell let's
take a bit more as she burned it oh girl
so you had the privilege of doing my
first dark brows I guys I announced yeah
I'm gonna put a link to mine and reach
his video on her channel down below and
I'll put a link to the other videos as
well if you've not seen them and but
yeah I thought this would be like so fun
same I was really excited to him like I
say I feel like we've both done like a
really good Jaguar to this model I feel
like I dunno if you do but I get loads
of requests like do makeup on someone
else I got a video so bad a person
minutes yeah if you want to see this
look right here then keep on watching
make sure you give it a massive thumbs
up if you want to see it more videos
from what and Rach and yeah
let's go okay so starting with skin I'm
using strobe cream and this is actually
Rachel's this is the sort of peachy temp
one and she loves using this as like a
base so I thought I would use hers
because she obviously knows that it
works really well with her skin and I'm
just blending it out with a split fibre
brush from Mac I absolutely love this
brush it's really handy for cream and
powder products then starting with eyes
I'm using soft ochre by Mac and we're
doing something super glam today excuse
my voice it's gone really croaky like
I'm getting really bad cold and but yeah
that's why we start with eyes because we
want to do something super glam and
intense and dramatic so I thought I'd
include basically a bunch of sped up
clips with this so you can see like how
much time I spend like on blending and
stuff and but starting with a transition
color this is from makeup forever
I cannot remember for the life of me
like the shades and stuff of all these
different like products and eyeshadows
and powders and stuff but
within will be linked down below
including every single brush that I use
because I have mixed it open use a
couple of different and brushes
throughout this video as well so just
popping that in the crease I'm starting
in the outer corner and I do start with
her eyes shot but then I always ask if
I'm doing someone else's makeup to make
sure that they keep opening their eyes
so that I can see where the product is
placed
it's obviously most important to know
that the product and the sort of
blending looks right when the eye is
open so that is a good tip I'm just
building on top of it with the modern
renaissance palette palette sorry by
anastasiya and in the red shade and then
I'm taking cabin fever I believe this is
by makeup geek like I said everything
will be linked down below this is going
to start our outer corner sort of like
that and so as you can see again I'm
sped it up but it's basically just like
really short movements I basically put
the product down first and Pat it and
then I do really sort of soft like
really small movements with the blending
brush and I'm using a 2-1 7 and then I
go back in with the two to fold just to
blend it back into the transition colors
and then taking and the deeper Brown
from the modern renascence palette and
building on top of that I'm using a more
precise brush and as you can see because
I've done ice fairs I'm really not
worrying about like the messiness of
this I just want to get the product in
place if anything in my opinion it's
better to have it a little bit messy
because then it's easier to clean up and
it looks way more sharper like I just
love making a mess and then just clean
it up with a white because it works so
much better and I'm just building on top
with what is this black hole it's from
makeup geek because it insomnia no it's
a lie corrupt sorry and yeah I'm just
building on top with that just to add a
little bit more depth so again using the
same brush and using really small gentle
movements and placing the product where
I want it making sure that Rachel keeps
opening her eyes so that I can see what
it looks like with our eyes open and
then going back in with the original
blending brush with no additional
product just to sort of blend the edges
and make sure nothing looks harsh and
everything is nice and smooth again just
like taking it way out do not worry
about being messy like honestly because
the minute you clean it up with a wipe
it looks so so sewn in and so I'm just
intensifying all of those colors using
the exact same shades that I just use
and just building on top of that until
the I'm happy with the way it looks
that's my favourites very bit oh my gosh
I cannot speak sorry that is my favorite
way to do a shadow I just take a little
time and but oh my god oh my god I just
take a bedtime and build on top as you
can see I've sped up all the clips so
you can see the amount of shadow and
sort of time I take to blend like I
really like to take my time with it and
and then this is the most satisfying
part we're going to take a wipe and
start cleaning it up again I take my
time doing this because I always get
scared that I'm going to clean up too
high so as you can see I'm starting
doing the angle really low I don't know
what we were talking about here and but
yeah I start by doing the angle really
low and then I just go up and open up
like I don't like to go in straight away
really quickly and just do one swipe
because I like to make sure that both
sides are even and that they're not too
high up and then I'm going in with a lid
shade this is best makeup by Mac it's
one of their stuff so shadows I'm
obsessed with this you guys know I love
it
I wanted something as a base for what
we're about to go in with so this is
sort of like a cream to powder product I
would say and some using a - for -
because it's synthetic it packs it on
really well and just popping that on the
lid and then I'm going on top with one
of these star powders and by Make Up For
Ever these are so stunning again I will
link it down below and but having a base
that really just makes that pop as you
can see and I just love this eye look
especially on Rachael she's got such
beautiful eyes to do eyeshadow on like
this so big and so round and there's so
much like lids face increase face like I
just absolutely love this look on her
and then of course doing a wing this is
so easy because obviously you've already
got the cleaned up line if you should go
doing winged liner on yourself or on
other people then doing the whole like
white situation or even using tape like
either/or
is a really good way of getting a clean
crisp liner oh my god guys she made this
such a struggle for me like I sat so
still when she did mine but for some
reason she really got the giggles and
just could not stop laughing and you
kind of like see a little bit more in
the bloopers at the anchor as a blooper
section but yeah I'm just dragging it
back towards the lash line once I have
done the actual wing I prefer doing the
wing first just because I like it in the
hard way out of the way and and I never
really like get people to close their
eyes when I do winged liner I prefer
them to look down just because it's
easier to get right at the root of the
lashes like if people shut their eyes
they have a tendency to light and sort
of squash them together a bit I don't
know what the word is but like you just
get way more into like nooks and
crannies when the eyes are open
looking down rather than when the shot
and so I'm just taking that right the
way into the inner corner and then I'm
cleaning up with a bit of concealer
which you can always do I'll just go
back in with the wipe if you feel like
you've messed up a little bit or the
winged liner is not as sharp as you want
it to be and then I just did it on the
other side we nearly forgot mascara and
I'm applying lashes these are Rachel's
and they're like our dolls with
individuals stuck on top so I'll try and
like ask her and list down below which
ones they are but they are like custom
lashes that she did herself as you can
see if they are nice and fluttery and
wispy so go really well with the look
eyes are pretty much done so back onto
skin I'm using the Nivea man poche balm
you guys know I love this I wanted to
use a lot of my favorite and face
products on rich today just because like
it's something a little bit different to
what she might use on her regular basis
if you know what I mean and then I'm
using Makeup Forever HD stick you guys
know I love this and rates just have it
but I'd feel like she doesn't use it
like tons and tons as much as I do so
I'm just mixing two shades together that
I feel like best match her fake tan and
popping this on the skin with a morphe
and 439 I want to hit the skin to be
nice and like luminous and Joey because
Rachel's skin like it's so beautiful and
clear and it's kind of dry not dry so
it's kind of like normal so I don't need
to worry about like oiliness or anything
like that I can have it quite Joey
if you know what I mean and then going
in with some Maybelline fit me I'm just
popping this under the eyes I use the
shade of 15 just because her foundation
is quite dark and even though I wanted
it sort of like highlighted I didn't
want it like super instantly intensely
highlighted oh my god my voice is like
so going I swear to God and blending
that out with a damp Beauty Blender just
to make sure it picks up any excess
products because we don't want the skin
to look cakey that's what I love about
these two products because the Make Up
For Ever foundation as well even though
it's a really good coverage it's quite
thin on the skin like you really don't
feel it and obviously she's got
beautiful skin anyway so I didn't want
like any extra product or anything that
didn't need to be there and just setting
that with some allure Laura Mercier
straight away and with the same Beauty
Blender I love doing this because I feel
like the powder just sort of melts into
the concealer and and then I'm just
setting the rest of the skin
particularly like in the t-zone and she
also mentioned around like her nostrils
and is an area where she can sort of
loose foundation throughout the day just
to make sure it all stays
in place down onto brows I'm using the
Anastasia dip brow in Rich's shades this
is soft no it's not oh my gosh I can
trim the shades but I'll link them down
below one of them's brown and then I
think the other ones like ash brown and
blonde I'm actually just trying
sorry about that and but I'm basically
creating the arch first with the darker
shade and then doing short flicks
obviously reaching his brow she doesn't
have like much of an arch so I
concentrated on their face and use the
darker shade for that just to make sure
that we got a nice amount of definition
there and then I'm just using the
lighter strokes towards the inner part
of the brow and flicking upwards with
the blonde shade just because it's a
little bit lighter and more natural just
helps to create like a really nice
gradient throughout the route and help
it to look as like natural as possible
if we want to use that word and then
moving on to lower lashline I am using
it the same makeup geek shadow which is
cabin-fever poppin this under the eyes
just so much the upper part that I like
the lid and the crease button in that
quite heavily down because Rachel's got
really beautiful like big eyes so she
can really get away with like a really
intense smokey lower lash line and then
I'm popping a little bit of the dark one
select the dark brown and the black from
Anasazi and then Maiko geek I'm sort of
like buffing these in with a more
smaller brush I couldn't think of the
word but yeah a smaller more precise
brush just to make sure they're not as
blended as far down so it creates like a
nice gradient and then going back in
with a clean brush just to blend the two
together then we're doing lower lashes
and reach to this self just to save some
time so just popping some lashes on
little just popping some mascara on the
lower lashes oh my gosh I honestly need
help today I swear to God and then
highlight in the inner corner with nylon
oh my god this really just like complete
look for me I love this inner corner
highlight so much like the shade nylon
by Mac is just my favorite thing to
highlight in a corner and brow bone
width so I'm putting like a generous
amount of this on because um like that I
look in general is quite dramatic so I
feel like it can really get away with
like a really intense inner corner
highlight and I just feel like oh my
gosh look at it like the way the light
hits it like it's so stunning I just
love it and I feel like it just really
makes her eyes pop even more
she's like hello and then on to bronzer
we use in-cab blend by Mac this is in
the shade dark I've been really enjoying
this runs with
minute just because it blends like a
dream like it's a really beautiful
powder even though it's not specifically
a bronzer I just use a darker shade and
applying this to cheekbones temples
jawline I'm using a brush by Sigma on
the good guys my voice like I'm
literally going to wake up tomorrow not
have a voice I swear to God and but yeah
just apply this on the cheekbones just
add a little bit of definition and
structure to the face and then on the
jaw line because the foundation didn't
like quite much a neck so I wanted to
make sure that it was all blended
together and there was no like
difference or like harsh lines or
anything like that and then I am just
patting back in with some foundation
just make sure it's all blended I always
go back in with a foundation brush just
to blend everything out then we are
using mmm oh my gosh I'm really sorry
the actual dimension skin finish I think
this is by the Mariah Carey and Mac it's
in the shade like me me I want to say
I'll link it down below if it's still in
stock but I'm just using this as a
bronzer topper just on top to add a
little bit more luminosity and sort of
bronze enos to the skin and then for
highlighter I'm using Makeup Forever
profusion in the shade number two it's
like a really beautiful and gold shade
and I just knew like it would look so
stunning on a skin so I'm popping that
on and I am so sorry I'm literally just
like dying popping that on the
cheekbones top to the cheekbones Cupid's
bow nose you know the drill all the
places we want to like shine bright like
a diamond
and then I'm finishing off with some sin
by Urban Decay just because the makeup
for everyone wasn't like as intense as I
want it to be I wanted the skins like
really sort of like big glowy and pop so
it much like the intense sort of
highlighted lid on the eyes in the inner
corner just popping that on like so and
then what are we going to do after this
I really don't know I don't know why
this clip is so long hello oh yeah I'm
too lips I'm using stripped down by Mac
ray cheese basically is explaining that
one of her and sides on her upper lip
isn't as full as the other ones so I
just wanted to make sure that I got them
even and made sure that both sides were
as full as each other and so yeah I'm
using this to line her lips and I wanted
a sort of standard nude lip something
that I really love because this whole
like makeup look is obviously something
that I would wear that I really love so
yeah I'm just lining her lips I feel
like I've said that about three times
sorry
and then I'm
go in with a liquid lipstick by two
phases is in the shade shade child start
and I've been loving this recently it's
such a beautiful like pink nude just
phone lips in with that and blending in
with the liner so there's no sort of
difference and like harsh lines between
the shades and then we're finishing off
with some gloss by kylie this is in the
shade is so cute and just popping this
all over the lips just again to blend I
wanted a really glossy lip to go with
this sort of like glowy skin and like
bright intense like shimmery let's just
pop in some of this on and then finish
it off with some you a lip topper in the
shade skinny dip look at this it is
stunning
so yeah that's the finished look I'm
sorry about this voiceover wow are you
feeling yeah you don't you like you
can't stop looking yourself
I need nylon in my life I've forgotten
about it if you know about nylon and I
just forgot I don't really have about my
football I'm okay it's like as soon as

never stop point it on again with love

finished look I really hope you guys
