going to be a fail or Holy Grail video
I'm still at the Marc Jacobs beauty
products as a lot of you know these this
range of acetal out of too much a good
few is so expensive so I thought I would
do a video on it I pick some stuff up
from Sephora they've recently launched
and the dew drops which are like dilute
the liquid Luminator and they've
launched a hydration like sesame miss
and then there's also the coconut primer
that has been around for quite a while
so all of them apart like the coconut
range I just thought it'd make like a
fun fail or Holy Grail videos test out
because obviously I've tried the
foundation I really did not like that
and because I picked up quite a few
products I thought I would try them all
in the same look and the same video and
so I'm going to do this the same as I
did that hourglass one but I'm just
going to be like one checking so I'm
already filming this at half three so by
the time I've got the product I'm
probably like four and then I will
really have times like a few check-ins
of you know I mean I've obviously done
my eye makeup and I've got moisturizer
on and that's it so we're going to start
with the primer primer is called the
undercover perfection coconut face
primer they all come in packaging that
looks like so and they all have the same
sort of like bottle container as well
they glass container next was really
lovely and luxury obviously it's very
expensive and all the coconut range has
the white lid so I've got new Marc
Jacobs Beauty page up on my laptop which
is why I might be looking down here and
just to give you some information about
the actual products because I have to
say there's not a lot of information on
the boxes at all so there is a long
description about this primer honestly
it says instantly impeccable skin smooth
and makeup Maximizer the under color
productive a lot but that under covers
perfecting coconut face primer brings
the refreshing feel of coconut to your
face while it affects an extent makeup
where with its hydrating nutrient rich
formula it's especially ideal for normal
to dry types to create a smooth and
improved surface before foundation
application which sounds perfect for me
because if you know me I do have normal
to dry skin it says it's enriched with
concentrated coconut extracts which form
a natural vitamin rich barrier between
your skin and the makeup again I love a
thick primer they do also have like a
pro tip section on the website as well
which i think is really cool because it
basically gives you advice on how to
best apply it and help us
user so it just says to massage one pump
of the coconut based primer entirely
across the face after you moisturize and
before you apply your favorite Marc
Jacobs beauty foundation or going to
light is the primer you get one fluid
out of products which is pretty standard
for like a liquid like skin product and
it's $44 or if you want to buy it from a
UK website you can get it on downloads
for 32 pounds I believe so quite so
obviously we're going to use that
service I will quickly talk about the
dew drops as well though because you can
actually mix these in with the planner
as a base so the dew drop this is what
these look like so as you can see they
have like a yellow kind of a golden tint
to them and these are in the shade jus
you which i think is really cute so the
description says give your highlight a
shot of skincare inspired by Marc Jacobs
love of coconut water and the glow of
youthful radiant well hydrated skin this
luminous gel cream instantly lights up
the complexion so you can highlight skin
directly or mixes with foundation and
primers to transform into illuminating
elixir and then Li Pro tips section it
basically says you can apply one two
pumps of jew-jew drops directly to the
complexion under over foundation for an
elevated glow and usually fingers or a
brush and it also says you can mix it
into the primer or the full coverage
foundation to create a luminous
complexion so what I'm going to do and
the price of that by the way is the same
so it's $44 it's not out in the UK yep I
see me I'll be like go to two pounds as
well and I believe you also get one
fluid arms the same with the primer or
you actually get zero point eight fluid
ounces so it's slightly less product so
I think I'm going to try because I want
to try like mixing this in but I also
want to try the primer it's old so I
might do one half of my face with just a
primer and then one half with both so
that is what it looks like that that is
just one pump because on the website so
just use one pump so I'm just going to
take my brush and just use half of it on
this side of my face and start like that
and then we'll add the illuminator in
this side okay already I can tell that
like one pump would not be enough for
what I like to use on my face just
because my skin I like a thick barrier
between my face and my foundation so I'm
just going to pump another
pump out onto this pallets will give
that a gap it feels really lovely and
really moisturizing which I like because
I like a primer that almost feels just
like a moisturizer the smell isn't like
overwhelming like it doesn't smell
really stronger coconut so you don't
need to worry about that if you sort
person who doesn't like strong sense in
product okay so one pump did half of my
face so I'm just going to put another
pump onto my pallet and then also do
probably half a pump of this because it
says a little goes a long way so you can
see it there it's just like a sort of
golden oh it looks really pristine I'm
just going to mix them like that on the
pallet and just apply that on the skin
on the other side oh okay already you
can see that that is like so much more
luminous in my opinion this reminds me a
lot of what I've been doing with other
primers recently like I've been mixing
my makeup further step one hydrating
with my backer like the highlighting one
it's like pretty much that it feels like
the exact same my skin feels tacky which
I like because I like a base that feels
tacky because then makeup really sticks
on top so as I start the foundation I'm
going to use the Make Up For Ever Ultra
HD sticks because these my favorite and
I wanna make sure that I give it a good
go and so I'm mixing shades 1 1 7 &amp;amp; 1 1
8 so why 55 and why 3 to 5 because I
have like a little bit turned on but not
a lot and I'm just going to use a
stippling brush this looks filthy but I
only use it once it's my morphe and 459
and I used it yesterday with the same
foundation animation is running really
lovely on top which I would expect
because I swear by the foundation anyway
yeah my makeup Forever's step 1
hydrating no feel the exact same address
which is interesting so obviously that's
a tiny bit more affordable
okay so foundation is on looks really
lovely it looks just how I would want it
to look like if I was using a different
primer and now that they're both on I
can't tell the difference between each
side so I can't like tell a difference
I've had illuminating drops on this side
and not that side you're looking exact
same in my opinion and there was only a
tiny difference when I applied it anyway
so something to bear in mind if you want
to get them you
like we use the product I guess because
it's expensive I would say like just use
the primer and then hopefully this will
have a better use is like a liquid
highlighter so for concealer I'm going
to mix the Maybelline fit me and also
the NARS radiant creamy our list of
shades down below and I just love the
combination of these because it feels
really full coverage underneath my eyes
but it doesn't like look cakey and it
doesn't like crease and then I'm just
going to set it with the LTM a powder
which actually keeping the lower Messier
top just because it's so awkward to
packaging concealer blended really
lovely under the eyes as well no issues
that my skin is looking really good
so we're just going to try the dewdrops
over the foundation before I do the rest
of my makeup off camera I will just say
go by my hairline like I know it looks
crazy right now I'll fill it in right
when I've done the rest of my skin and
so I'm just going to use it on the top
of my cheekbones and I'm just going to
start with one side and we'll see what
it looks like it says you can use a
brush or your fingertips
I believe so maybe we'll try like a
brush / light Beauty Blender their site
and try fingertips aside and see if
there's any difference so I'm just going
to pop a pump onto the palette me try
this so this is emerged by backstage
beauty and I'm going to like just take a
little bit on the brush and see how it
goes have to say it is very thick by the
way like it's a super like thick creamy
gel I'm just going to stop there
I mean technically this should be fine
because we've not set the skin so I'm
going to show using patting motions
because I don't really like to swipe
because I feel like it can remove a
foundation so far it looks very nice but
it is like really quite golden yellow
Ito and I don't have a lot of fake
tannin at the minute and so it doesn't
really look like much of a highlighter
because it's also a lot darker than the
concealer that's right next to it I mean
you can't see it that and it looks
stunning on camera I would say I can see
like more with the naked eye okay so
that is what that side looks like
compared to that side it's very natural
is what I'll say like super natural if
your my skype that Marvel up my skin
tone or lighter I mean if you see with
that I wouldn't use this as a
highlighter because I just think that
it's like because it's got like a tint
to it and I don't know I can't see it
working on like really fair skin on
camera I feel like it looks really
bright and like really quite intense but
in person it looks really soft and
really subtle which if you like a subtle
highlight you will love this and the
actual color of it is lovely but it
definitely has just like melted into my
skin kind of and just like I don't like
disappeared but it is just like really
soft and really natural feel like Beauty
Blender is the best way something like
this I feel like it helps it like melt
into the other products a little bit
better than like your finger or a brush
honestly like I do really like it now
that I'm like looking at my face as a
whole it's definitely there but it is
just like quite subtle in my opinion so
yes that is what the skin looks like so
far
obviously I've not set my face as powder
yeah but it gives you an idea you can
definitely see it on camera so far I
really like both products so I'm going
to do the rest of my makeup off camera
and then I'll come back at the end and
we'll do the same spray okay so this is
what the makeup looks like now that I've
finished
I'm really feeling my makeup today like
I've missed doing makeup like this so
much where I do like no liner and just
like 40 lashes because I feel like I'm
not done this in a really long time and
overall everything blended beautifully
on
like I love my skin today I really do
and I feel like obviously it's not just
a primer but having a good base medical
primer is just so important so I
definitely think that contributed and I
did add a powder highlighter on top of
the like the dew drops that we
originally applied and again I'll link
it down below if you want to know where
it actually is to buy makeup forever I
really like these so far both of them
get my approval as well moving on to the
setting mess I'm going to zoom out
another subtle ha I have to say I'm a
little bit nervous to try this just
because when I mentioned that I bought
it like I got a lot of sweets and there
was a lot of comments in that and some
people have used it and it ruined their
makeup because like the way it flows out
it just sprays out weird and it like
just ruins your foundation so I'm
praying that it does it because today is
a good makeup day so this is called the
recover perfection at coconut setting
mist and it says recover your glow in
sets and the facts with this next
generation makeup set amiss that
combines 24 hour performance with
hydrating skin loving active sounds like
something that I need and it says this
fine micro-mist you with a
healthy-looking geoglyphs complexion
complexion at the same time fixing
makeup so it stays put and looks fresh
all day long as for the throat it's very
simple it just says press down
completely for fine mist close eyes and
mist one two three sprays directly on to
face start with one mist and add more
for the juist glow which is a lot
difference or the second phrase I've
used I will say because I'm used to like
drench myself in my urban decay one as
you can see is a white liquid which is
what scares me because I just I'm
worried that like it'll go on as a white
liquid and it will like give me white
patches on my foundation which I swear
the guard will hit the bar
I'm going to like spray it oh my god it
like okay I'd like products coming out
of the lid as it's spraying I don't know
if you can see that but that is like
could be an issue
this is 39 $39 sorry it's not out in the
UK yet so it's actually less than the
primers and the dew drops and how much
product do you get so you get 3.8
answers which seems like a reasonable
amount for the money and a swell like if
you don't have to use one miss per time
you can make anyway I feel like this
would last a lifetime
I'm going to hold it like a way away
like I would usually hold my Urban Decay
what about here I'm gonna hold it about
that
feels good okay let me just make sure
I'm doing it doing it back okay okay
that was one spray definitely went the
majority on my forehead because of how
it angled it and what it looks like
nothing that's maybe two okay so I've
got one more turns into about seven more
I don't know what do you think one skin
doesn't look any different in my opinion
it there's a little patch here where
either like a lot of product come out at
once and it's kind of left a little mark
where my concealer is doesn't feel like
I've sprayed anything onto my skin like
usually when I spray my own decay bar
and my skin feels wet I don't know if
it's really use a lot but like I think
the spray in general just makes your
skin feel quite wet as I use the chair
one and where is this it reminds me a
lot of if anyone's tried the touch it
luminous chewy in this it's always weird
when I use this because I spray it but
it feels like there's no products going
onto my skin and that is exactly what
this feels like
whereas my urban decay one I feel it's
absolutely doing something I'm actually
setting because I feel it there so it's
currently quarter size on the guys
so it's so long I can literally piss
around for you so I'm doing make up a
sweat four to five and I'm going to
leave it on probably until about 11 or
so because I am doing some things today
so I'll check back with you in a little
bit okay so it's now closer to 11 or 22
11 actually and 1/2 1/2 9 often I've had
it on for 6 hours now so this is what
the skin looks like after 6 hours and
forehead is pretty much the same yeah
it's just like my under eye here and
like this area here my skin still feels
really hydrated it doesn't feel like
I've got any make point whatsoever
anymore which is quite common to the
foundation as well like when I wasn't
Makeup Forever HD stick and it always
feels really lightweight so again that's
like
pretty normal for me so yeah I'm
relatively happy with the results
overall if I was going to say is any of
it worth it and my favourite product is
probably the primer which is this one
here just because it's so almost rate is
so suitable for my skin top my skintone
my skin type if you have normal to dry
skin and you're in the market like a
high-end primer or you want to find a
good one and you willing to spend a
little bit more money and I would
definitely recommend this and obviously
this is the only product out of all
three that is available in the UK as
well the dewdrops were really pretty
obviously like when we use it as a base
and then put foundation on top I felt
like that didn't really change anything
too much and but it definitely worked
nicely as like a base for powder
highlighter did it make from the
difference I personally don't think so
it's very natural in my opinion and it's
a lot of products that I would probably
mix in with foundation like to see a
foundation that's like more on the map
side it does say on the website like one
of the pro tips is to mix it in with the
remarkable full coverage one the one
that's like really thick I'm really mad
I can see why and that's the sort of
thing I would use it for or say on a no
makeup day when I just want to add like
a little bit of something because I do
like applying a little bit of
highlighter when I'm not wearing
anything else because if you're likely
makes your skin look really healthy
I probably Vitz about in terms of the
mist this is probably like my least
favourite product it's something I just
don't really rate and particularly
because my makeup has come off a little
bit like on my lower cheeks if I was
wearing an urban decay trail it usually
wouldn't do that and another one is it
really did remind me of the touch one in
the sense that struction brushes it
really did remind me of the touch one in
the sense that when I spray it on like
it just doesn't feel like any product is
going on my face and I don't know it's
weird I just don't think it's like worth
the money I honestly prefer my urban
decay 100%
nothing has ever a place out and I've
tried a good few assessing sprays
now yeah that was my sort of fail or
Holy Grail on the three Marc Jacobs
products from the coconut range that we
tried out today definitely more of a
success than the foundation because that
was just a disaster I really hope you
all enjoyed this video and found it
useful let me know if you tried any of
these products in the comments down
below or if you think you're going to
try any now I will like them if you want
look at them yourself thank you so much

barking I will see you in Southeast
