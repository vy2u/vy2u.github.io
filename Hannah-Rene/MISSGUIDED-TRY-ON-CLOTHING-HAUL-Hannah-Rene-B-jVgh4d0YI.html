Han so today's video is going to be a
misguided haul because I asked on
Twitter on app I asked if anyone wanted
to see this and it was the most voted
for on the pile you guys know the holes
as much as me I feel like which is on
the same page and I love it so I do pick
these clothes out but they weren't very
kindly sent to me I will obviously
always be honest about what sends me
what's poor and things like that but you
guys know I love misguided and I do
spend a lot of my own money on there and
so I feel really grateful that I have
some goodies to share with you today I
am really feeling inscribed at may like
I love it all the time but I went on the
new in-page to like pick some stuff out
and I was just like Hello so the first
thing is a denim dress they had this in
this color which is black obviously I
want with a platform because yeah they
had it in black and then they also had
it intersect plain blue denim but I got
the black because I just live in black
this is what it looks like it's
basically a v-neck with no sleeves and
it is generate kind of hospital like on
camera and then it's just got a big
salty zip all the way down I'm talking
like all the way down I really like it
as well because it's like an a circle
ring zip I don't know why I just love it
as it is I've got another item minimal
I'm going to show you this goddamn zip
like this as well I just don't they're
quite edgy and they just like add a lot
with them into the dress if you don't
mean well honestly this this someone
could just look ruin your day I swear
it's nice because the denim does feel
quite stretchy and I love fabrics with
dresses that have a bit of stretch
because I feel like they're really hokey
curves in a really nice way and it just
looked so frigging good on the model it
wasn't it's just very edgy I don't know
like I can just imagine the type of pair
of boots and like a big oversized like
very jacket or something like that or
like a bomber jacket I just think it's
like really cool and I just love the way
it looked is very simple very sort of
like minimal and I just really love it
I'm really I'm feeling this one I like
it a lot than this I'm really excited
for so I have to have the full
collection of this now this is really
bad like it's the common obsession so we
all know that I'm obsessed with bondage
stuff and mascara
or like in general just fine which
clothing and behind the other two pieces
I showed in my last hole I think it was
what is my voice just do oh yeah it's
basically from the peace and love range
which is like their more luxury
collection and it's just black and it's
got this sort of what's it actually
called what do they call it they call it
a crisscross bandage sue I would I just
had watch myself in the finish but yeah
it's basically like a lift up like so
and I do have the dress on the skirt as
well because I just love it so much I
don't know what it is it's just like a
bandage again I'm obsessed with this
awesome ascribes it's find it it's
really good quality and it really makes
you think just pop and I love the sort
of crisscross on it it's just very
minimal very simple really easy to wear
it's a bodysuit as I said so it just you
know goes down into the underwear
section it's got a gold at the part and
it just sort of look so fab with like
wildlife houses or ripped jeans for like
a daytime local like an evening or like
drinks or something like that or I don't
know like a bandage scare and some heels
I just I just saw it and I had to have
it okay next thing is a shear which is a
little bit different to me because I
don't really worship and but I saw this
on their Instagram and I just love the
way it was styled like I love some sort
of vibe going over there it's way too
clean a sort of washed black and like
really dark grey blackish color and then
it just got distress and rips all over
and then it's got silver buttons down
the center was a little color at the top
and the way this was cells on the model
is she was wearing it open with like a
white top like a white race to top
underneath I believe again I'm just
really actually really cool and I feel
like it's a good piece like a shirt like
this when we're in this transition
between like winter and spring I feel
like she gets a nice because they're not
too happy but they are quite like sick
so they keep you warm and I'm just
excited to like try and sell this I've
got it in a pen so it was like a little
bit oversized and I just think it's
quite versatile you know I'm excited to
try it and style it because it's not
really something I would usually wear
but I'm going to get that gold and
fingers crossed I look as good as them
off of it next thing is a jumper because
I really cannot live without a jumper I
just live breathe die swap do a full
face of glance everything in jumpers so
this one I thought was really cute
this in a couple of different colors I
believe and there was like a white and
black quant as well that was like white
with a black color but I just love the
gray because I don't have a lot of gray
jumpers I have a lot that like nude and
a lot of black and I don't really have
anything that's grey so it's just like a
round net with white stripes and then
it's also got stripes on at the cost and
also on the bottom because it is cropped
which I just thought was really sweet
like I like the way it's sort of punched
in if you know what I mean like it's
cost on both the collar the sleeve and
the sort of bottom of the jumper just
love stuff like this so like throwing on
with a pair of jeans and high trainers
something really easy and casual or just
like wearing around the house or
throwing on after a shower like I just
love knitwear and jump it's a must phase
that's all this one was really cute I
got to know the textures come on okay
and then the next thing again it's
bandaged because we've established my
obsession my addiction and my need for
help but it's going to continue so this
is a really quite long black dress and I
just love this mostly for the detailing
on the sort of chest area so it's
basically a v-neck as you can see it's
quite a deep core I will say obviously I
might try this stuff on yet but I will
try on so you'll see like how deep it is
then and I got in an 8 because as I said
I always get justice in an April
misguided and then it's got long sleeves
and it goes into a really super quite
long like it's below uni and drafts but
I just love the way that they have this
sort of the light gold hooks all the way
down and just love the way that on the
collar like you've got them either side
and then by the time it gets to the
actual like centre of the dress they
sort of join up into like actual little
hooks and just hook all the way down
like I thought that was really cute yeah
just with a pair of heels it's cars if
at the buckle on case anyone was
wondering and just with a pair of heels
for like a night owl and like a trench
coat or something like that bandage
dresses are just an essential in my life
I love them so much especially for like
first a night owl or things like that
where you want to be like super glam but
still super comfortable because I do
find them really comfy to wear right and
then this next piece I'm really excited
about because if anyone follows me on
snapchat
not long ago I posted a picture of a web
site it was the Puma web site because I
was looking at the sense of humor
collection because I'm not
and and they had a off the shoulder like
a barge oh bomber jacket and one seen it
let me know because I basically posted
that I was like I wanted it but it was
five from Japan it was 500 pounds
reduced from a thousand pounds like it
was originally a grunt yeah it was
originally a brand it was reduced to 500
and I really wanted to do it but I told
myself no Hannah no actually discipline
myself I hope you're proud because it
was really hot I've been there I go on
misguided and it got the same thing like
literally so may she was that there was
one on boom who but it wasn't long like
the thing that I loved about the Pima
one was like it was really quite big and
bulky and long time and I just thought
it'd look really cool like I would put
is that plane yet the few more on which
is like so big and bulky and oversized
and just imagined it like unzipped like
it's not the sort of thing I was it for
tomorrow's like a proper jacket but just
like with a t-shirt dress or something
like that or like a little sort of
bodycon dress and like I don't know I
just had ideas in the mind and I just
knew they'd look good and then I was
real upset about price but I just hit
myself in the face this is the one that
I saw on misguided and as soon as I saw
it I was like it was meant to be so it's
pretty much the exact same thing and
like I said it's pretty long line in my
opinion which I loved because the one on
Blue Hill which was the only other
off-the-shoulder bomber jacket I found
was quite sure but I wanted it long I
was like it needs to be like the one
that one and that's what this is so for
anyone who'd like that jacket on my
snapchat or in general if you just want
something a little bit different here is
your option here is the perfect option
because again it's miss Kylie's it's
like relatively affordable and again
like I was saying it's got the cool
little circle rings and it's got that on
the main zip and then also on it the
pockets as well so it's pretty much this
Bardot it just sits like that and then
it's just got em like cuffs please and
also as cost bottom as well and it's
just no smug and big and buggy but like
not feel heavy I just I just feel
blessed but this provide I really feel
quite like sex oh it's another croc
little jumper this one is in a camel
color and it just looks like so and the
thing that I loved about this is it's
got massive sleeves like I am loving
stuff we'd really wide please at the
minute
I recently got off MIDI which is also
from the sense of humor collection I
really just have an addiction at bars
and it's got massive sleeves like I
posted a couple times on my Instagram
it's like a zip up and it's just so
oversized and big I actually live in it
like it's a confusing other and I love
the way that the sleeves are like muffin
is like hair look the way to sue the
mustard but you can sort of roll them
off and like play with them and you just
have so much like materials to play with
then I'll just go there this is kind of
the same and it's got an extra a little
bit as well because we've actually got
ties on the bottom so these can be like
tied into foes or like the ends like at
your wrists and whatnot just got a round
neck and then it just goes into like a
cropped caramel jumper so I just really
love this very varied like minimal very
basic and but I feel like the wide arms
and like the little straps that you can
might tie I just think it absolute to it
and I this is a sort of thing that I
just wear with like my caramel leggings
and like a pair of trainers just like
run out and about because you know 90%
of time I really am just wearing like
leggings and a top I always mention that
because when I got me in some home I'm
like looking at my Hill photos I'm like
you're making out like you're some grand
 bitch and you really know
Allister guys like I don't know I
literally live in leggings I live in
leggings and jumpers and sweats and I
just I love it it's a great life I
recommend it to everyone yeah this is in
a I just really like it I think it's
nice and big and slouchy I'm yummy and
it's a color color what more could you
ever want
okay next up this is a jumpsuit and
actually got this because I have it in
black and I really love it and so it's
basically a bandeau where's it gone
so it's a bandeau like so if I see it
find oh yeah yes but no sleeves no shots
or anything like that and it's like a
massive material and then in the center
where like to sort of middle of your
waist is and it's like a see-through
messy part whether it's like none of the
sort of underlay and then it just goes
into
cropped leggings and I have this in
black and again and I really love it
I just love it because again it's really
comfy but you can really dress these off
like you can wear I wear my black one
you can wear it with like heels
I like the trench coat and it looks like
a really glum outfit even though you've
lips you just got like a mesh job super
um it's just like a one-piece it's
really like cozy looks nice and cute you
know it's very versatile again like I
said it can be worn with like
about my jacket and trainers for like a
day out shopping or you can put like a
trench coat on or like a big fairy coat
and like some little heels or some heels
boots and I'm just all about versatility
to start the right word did I say that
right I don't know all are being this
child's with my outfits so yeah I really
love it
