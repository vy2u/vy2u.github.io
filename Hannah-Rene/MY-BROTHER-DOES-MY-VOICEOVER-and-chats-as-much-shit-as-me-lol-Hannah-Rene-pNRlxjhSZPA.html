be showing you a cool fresh new amazing
beautiful makeup look and we're just
going to start the video with some
cheeky smile and some pointy eyelids and
eyelashes and cheeky way I'm going to
stroke my chin quick with this moist wet
wipe and all-over stroke it all over the
face we're going to get the the lower
nostril region make sure that's nice and
dry for the study video now we're going
to apply some vitamin C this is how I
keep my skin daily fresh beautiful daily
skin routine has a tutorial to come and
see you and probably tomorrow 12:00 a.m.
just lay now now I'm going to take the
the nicer sandy peachy polity piloting
and fly all over the eyelids get a nice
long stroke going to blend that
gracefully across the base make sure it
stretches right to the is now going to
take the brown square and we're going to
it brush and brush that all over the Sun
and make sure it's nice and blended and
contoured and now take an orange square
we do the same gap ever the Latin gabber
blend you know I'm going to make a whole
new color spectrum here you know it's
going to be a very original makeup look
I hope you guys like this and take this
out all the time now we're going to go
with the Rouge in the corner and
shockingly dhaba all over the point make
sure the point is nice and defined I'm
going to now together blended right the
edges because you cannot mess up when
otherwise the whole thing looks like a
pile of shite now we're going to take
the the wipe and sharpen this is
straight across the face because you
know you ain't got no point you ain't
got no life right yeah no point it is a
vogue idiot now we're going to draw a
quick line some black sharp brush
straight across the under eyebrow region
and stretch that right over
mileage careful not to screw myself in
the eye otherwise I'll be catastrophe
I'd probably blind it's a very dangerous
tutorial I hope you guys both take care
I don't want any injuries after this I
mean just comment below if you like
accidentally blind yourself
I'm intrigued then you imply themselves
because I probably will now we're going
to use this clamp and just clamp our
eyelids and make sure we get long rush
is all over the place and now we're
gonna see the brush up and down and make
sure lashes are feeling lots of love
because you know you get the last love
and they love you back
they feel they feel a lot of volume for
you you know they make sure you know
you're there when you need them
now you're going to pinch some extra
lashes on top of the lashes make sure
they're nice and full and now I'm just
gonna take the stencil what am I doing
with my eyes oh my god
just wiggle my eyelid up and down just
give it a nice little vibrates and this
step wow this is an important step this
is almost a ritual this point I've heard
like holy religion is being founded upon
this so we're just going to take some
Nivea man put it all over the face make
sure it gleams glistens glows and I was
taking the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
fawned brush I'm just going to brush it
all over the face get a nice healthy
skin tone across the face you know when
everyone snow again vitamin D all the
time and the Sun lots of time now going
to get enough fog careful not to go too
much up into the hair we don't want
orange hair and now I'm going to now I'm
going to take a this big orange chin
stick thing and just stick across my
chin or my cheek bone
I'm now just going to blend that in make
sure it all looks correct I mean you
can't have just stripes on your teeth
you look like a fool you wanna make sure
you get it blended
the next piece of equipment I'm using is
the fill time white sand liquid stick
and we're gonna liquid stick under our
eyes make sure talked about that make
sure that they're included in this
fantastic tutorial and I'm going to take
my two hundred pound tear drop sponge
and sponge all over my face because I
paid so much money for this fucking
thing it has to be used in every goddamn
video I mean I can't not include it now
I'm going to take my pot of white powder
cream powder creamer say these brushes
by the way guys these are like original
great hair brush things I use the brush
with a spoon now I'm taking the eye
thing this is the dark brown flavor
eyebrow color palette from Mark
cosmetics and I'm going to color my
browser make sure they're nice and bold
stand out from my from my beautifully
cosmetic face next is roche amoeba and
iced okra color palette we're going to
take a take that under the little eyes
and get some some low tone eyelids here
and design them almost masterfully so I
can a work a lot so the next step here
is to take the gold silver circle
palette and we're going to brush that
into the corner of the eye so it needs a
very fine pointed pointy brush here and
make sure we get a lot of detail because
this part while this part is essential
and now cheek face now I'm going to
brush in a circular motion almost like
you would wash a car with your foam hand
and the cheeks and forehead make sure
you get a lot of perfectly symmetrical
blend and now I'm going to take the the
silver shiner and shine my cheekbones
make sure they pop they pop in
you know the next part of this tutorial
is to take the Carly lift kit and I'm
going to take the lip pencil and I'm
just going to fill all around my lips
make sure they look nice and bold and
I'm going to take the lipstick and just
go color all over my lips make sure
they're looking nice and shiny now the
final step is to take my 300-pound
bottle of flavored water and spray all
of my face like princess and thank you
for watching today tutorial hope you all
do this and then garlic have a great
time and everyone just knows how your
makeup is popped in love love you guys
