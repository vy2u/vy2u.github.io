going to be another current must have
enough sessions because I'm not doing
one of these and another thing Upton won
this year I'm pretty sure the last one I
did was for the whole of 2016 I don't
think I've done one since so I wanted to
do another one and basically sit down
and have a chat with you about some of
the products that I have been loving
recently cuz it's basically a mix of
like makeup products and skincare
products and a couple of hair products
as well so I've always I'm going to
start with makeup because that's the
best one my first most habit recently is
in this palette right here and I seen so
many tweets asking me to do a full video
on this and I promise I am going to get
round to doing like a full video on this
Z palette this is basically my warm
makeup geek palette so all the
eyeshadows are from makeup geek and I
made it myself and I've never really
done the video going through all of them
I have used it in tutorials but I am
gonna do one with that I just wanted to
mention a couple of the shades in this
video though because obviously I love
the whole thing like looking at it but
there's three items in particular which
are these three here I will let me zoom
it in in a minute so that you can see
that I've just been like obsessed with
recently though we've got sidekick which
is like the painless one a kind of all
the same I'm not going to hide it we got
a sidekick which is like the palest one
of the three and it's just like a really
beautiful like warm sort of toffee Brown
I would say then the next one along is
Coco bear which is like a shade darker
and it's kind of like a similar color
but literally acts just like a shade
darker and the one towards the very end
is cabin fever and that's kind of like
darker than the other two and it's not
as warm I would say I am just loving all
three of them recently in like the outer
corner and the crease and things like
that it's what I've actually got on my
eyes today and on the outer corner and
the inner corners do you like a little
bit of a halo eye they just blend like a
dream I might say it all the time yeah
you can see them now um so this one is a
cabin fever and then there's Coco bear
here and also sidekick here so you can
see that cabin fever is like the darkest
one and they've all got sort of like a
warm sort of reddish base to them I
would say when you swatch cabin fever it
doesn't come across as warm as the
others but I just think Western it like
this is the full palette in case you've
ever wanted to see it up close and but
yeah I'm going to do a video hopefully
on this soon because as you can see it
is beautiful you can see like swatches
are
they're all sort of mesh together and by
I'm going to do either like a full video
or a blog post or something rice watch
every single eyeshadow in that palette
because I know a lot of people want to
know what's in that and I will do it
from it next product is from Rimmel and
this is that stay matte powder this is
actually the Rita Ora Edition because
they brought out like a sort of mini
range with Rita Ora for fifty shades
darker I feel like the last person on
the planet to love this palette because
I feel like it's been going around for
so many years now like this was so many
people's like favorite drugstore
palettes are so long oh this one is in
the shade it here is their one it
transparent and it just looks like so
it's just like a normal sort of pressed
powder but I love it because one it's
not too heavy too it's not too dry in
and three does not like because it's a
transparent partner it doesn't like
change the color of my foundation it's
just so bloody colors and I don't know
why I'm not trying to do now because so
many people always rave about it and
clearly I just didn't want to jump on
the bandwagon but now that I have I'm
here to stay I pretty much use it on my
whole face or parts of my own dry
because I like to use a loose powder to
set my under eyes and I just love it
like it just does the job and nothing
more you know I feel like some powders
go a bit chalky because my skin can be
quite dry or like they change the colour
of my foundation or they just make the
makeup like not look how one it's look
like I just want a powder to set
everything and that is exactly what this
does it just keeps everything in place
perfect so just write all over the skin
it doesn't dry me out it lasts
throughout the day it's just it's good
and I like it and it's cheap what what
do you want next two products are by
benefit and these are the goof proof
brow pencil which looks like so and then
also the Gimme brow which is like this
little mini one here no I actually use
these in a full face of first
impressions not long ago if you've not
seen that video I'll pop it on the
screen here and you can go and check it
out I use these in that video and I
basically was saying how I like the
pencil but it was too light my eyebrows
which is still true I don't use this
throughout my whole entire brow
basically I have one end that's got like
a spoolie that you can like comb through
your eyebrows with I never know see that
way then the other side is actually like
the brow pencil and just sort of twist
up and it's like a normal bra pencil but
it's got like a little bit of a I'm go
to it I just think it's top and the
reason I like this brow pencil I don't
use it like for my whole eyebrow I
basically use it as a base for eyeshadow
is the thing that I like about it is
it's quite
it's very creamy it's not drained at all
which is the issue that I have with some
brow pencils where I'm trying to apply
them and no products is coming off
because it's just such a dry like crayon
yeah it's nice and creamy it's got like
a nice amount of pigmentation and it
just feels quite tacky when you apply it
but not like not sticky but it just
makes a really good base for eyeshadow
because I feel like it adds texture
where shadow car I love brow powders
that's pretty much what I'm use for my
whole entire brow but the issue is
powder sometimes is they make your brows
look kind of flat because they're just
like a powder they don't really cling to
your natural brow hairs whereas using
this first if you pull it through the
brow and then apply a powder it's like
this because it's kind of like a creamy
consistency of texture to your brow and
then the brow powder kind of sets it and
adds like the definition if you know
what I mean it's kind of hard to explain
what I'm trying to say I am hopefully
going to do an updated bro to toriel
soon as well because I feel like I've
really changed the way that I do my
brows since the last one and the last
one did really well I'm assuming a lot
of people like it and I kind of Rumble a
lot in it so I kind of just want to so
many Holly yeah I absolutely love that I
don't use it on its own and because I do
like having the control of a powder to
do like especially the front of my brow
but I love the formula bit that's like
my favorite thing and then this is so
good I just keep in my brows where I
want them to be like keeping my brow
hairs in place I basically do the pencil
first and a brow powder and then I
finish it off with this and it's just
really good like it's got a good amount
is like it's like mmm
it's got like a tint to it it's got like
yeah gotten this one is in the shade 5
and it's basically what I've gone today
and and it just adds a little bit
thickness it makes them look a little
bit bushier and a bit hairier which I
like because I like my brows to look
like eyebrows you know I feel like some
people I feel like you either love a
sleek brow that's like quite gel and
it's quite like sharp and fierce or you
like a sort of fluffy brow and I'm more
of like a fluffy brows person at the
minute if you know what I mean yeah it's
so good and like chromia has all and
then keeping them in place because like
I said I love the look of a bushy brow
and it just makes my hair look so much
fuller like when I've been uploading I
shot to instrument Lee everyone's
commenting on my brows and how they look
really thick and stuff and it's these
two sinks next thing I want to mention
this is coming a bit of a wig or next
thing is advised Becca and this is that
ultimate coverage complexion cream
foundation
so this is my dark one in the shade pan
and this is way too dark for what I've
gotten at the minute so it's not what
I'm wearing but I just have fallen in
love with this the thing that I love
about this is that it's very full
coverage like when I say full coverage
you need the tiniest bit but it doesn't
feel sick on the skin even though it's
quite a thick formula like it's quite
moosie and thick how many times can say
like that just doesn't feel it I feel
like some people because I've read
reviews about this and some people
really don't like it because I think
it's too heavy but I genuinely think
they must just be applying too much
because you need the tiniest tiniest
blob ever when I am applying this I
basically put like a tiny dot on my
brush and then I always swipe it first
like I don't run with patting motions
because it's so thick like it needs to
be swiped and like distributer
distributed across the skin there and
then I sort of go back in and like Pat
it into the skin and that creates like
the extra coverage but I just love it
like it's got a sort of natural satin
finish I would say it's not particularly
jewy and but it is my go-to foundation
for night owl I would say that makeup
forever or change to stick is more than
today's times foundation for me because
it's quite gooey and I can make it look
quite natural like it doesn't feel heavy
or anything like I can make it look
really minimal and it is very chewy
whereas this is a lot less chewy and
it's a lot thicker so it works better at
nighttime to me because I know it's
going to stay in place like that
sometimes the issue with the HD stick if
I don't set it really well like it can
move but this is like glue you apply it
and it's like it almost doesn't even
need the powder because I can just tell
that it's sat on my skin and it is that
next makeup item I want to mention some
people might have guesses because I feel
like I've mentioned it a good couple of
times so I like the past month or size
is by anastasi of Beverly Hills and it's
one of that liquid lipsticks in the
shade naked and it just looks like so
it's actually what I've got on my lips
today and I feel like it's what I've
worn as a nude for like the past month I
thought it's quite a while ago I have to
say and for some reason I just never
like picked it off enough to like fall
in love with it and but I used it in a
tutorial I think I don't know which one
it was
maybe like I don't know a cotton ball
watching toilet was but I just like used
it I love the color of it so much
because it's such a good nude like it's
not too pink it's not too peachy it's
not too Brown like it's just a good
standard nude it's definitely got like
more of a warm tone to it like it's not
completely
troll and but he just goes with like
every single look that I seem to do and
I just love it I love the formula like
it's quite sick it's not like the
two-faced ones which are quite liquidy
in my opinion like it's more of am sick
like sort of like the next ones and we
have lots of shades out and some icky
eyeshadows that is what the shade it
looks like it's quite um yes Lucy
dries pretty quickly I say that I need
two coats with it like I can't just do
one swatch and have it like completed
heroin it and it does need to top it up
quite a lot that's not only think I
would say and but the actual clove it I
just look this I don't really have many
other liquid lipsticks in this sort of
color
that's my only issue is a two basil and
I love them but I wish they had like a
better nude in the melted marks because
I feel like that wall quite pink and
yeah I look they're just quite peachy so
nice with spring and summer
just a really good at standard nude
lipstick and I think yourself I think
it's fabulous and then I quickly wanted
to mention this little cheeky situation
so this is a brush by Mac is a 1/2 a and
as you can see it's a split fibre you
thought it was one brush no yeah this is
a split fibre brush it's basically got
synthetic hairs and natural hairs to it
and it's like a foundation and a powder
brush in one pretty much that's how
violence and I've just been using this
non start to apply moisturizer and
primer I've gotten out of the habit
recently like applying it with my
fingers because a lot of the time I have
like fake tenants of my hands and I kind
of just like to use a brush because I
feel like even also wash my hands and
stuff I me like it sometimes more
hygienic to use a brush and then clean
the brush with brush cleaner and then
use it again and exhale other initial
stores a really nice job like it's very
soft and it's just like it blends it in
really well like it's a pretty basic
thing to use it's like applying primer
and moisturizer I know and but it is
quite an interesting brush to have I
feel like with cream products in general
this is a lovely like brush to have
wouldn't use it so much for powders even
though it does have like the natural
sort of powder a brush side to it
I just think the creams like I basically
pick the product up with a synthetic
side which is these ones here and I'm
sort of blending it and then the other
side with the natural hairs it just
helps to like blend it all together and
I might try it the foundation one day
because I'm not really like used it for
a lot of things other than like creams
and moisturizers but it's just a really
good brush it's quite interesting you
know I feel like if you do freelance and
makeup and stuff it's kind of like a fun
thing to have you know kind of has like
lots of different uses and oh yeah I
really loved it I got it a long time ago
not long time ago but I got it when I
worked at Mac and I've not really picked
it up and then I kind of use for it I
think I might you done great - actually
there was something that like really
sparked me to use this brush and I feel
like I used it on Rachel when I did her
makeup to do primer and stuff and I love
the way that her skin looks oh I did it
all myself
and voila that's how this happened okay
quickly once you mentioned a self-tanner
so this is countries the bronze facing
gel and it just looks like stir though I
was watching one of Holly's videos holy
beep why am i me why money yeah I was
watching a lot of Holly's videos Holly
Boone and I will link her channel down
below if she's not already checked her
out she did a video all about herself
colors and then she baked hands and like
exfoliates and apply of town and washes
off my wall all aww and I watched it
because her pan is always looking good
and I was like I need to know the
sequence I need to know them so one of
the things that she mentioned was this
which as I said is two countries the
bronze
face and gels basically like a facial
self-tanner and I've been on the hunt
for one of these for a while because
usually when I faked on my face I just
use the loving town like mousse I use
all of my body and just because I didn't
really have anything else to use and
obviously it's going to match like the
color of the rest of my time or the
issue that I had with that is because it
was like a mousse even though I used
mooster eyes underneath it it felt quite
drained on my skin and it kind of cling
to like areas where there's like small
hairs on my face I things like that it
just didn't it looked okay but it wasn't
it wasn't the best you know so I decided
to buy this because she recommended it
and her fake turn on her face as well as
always looking beautiful I loved it I
really enjoyed using it I basically
apply it wasn't what I expected it to be
because it's like a gel you lately pop
the lid and you like squeezed out you
will have to squeeze the bottle to get
flour
kind of like a really liquidy gel like
it's almost like just a pure liquid I
would say and and it's transparent it's
not got a color to it I expected it to
have a ten I don't really know why yeah
it's like a transparent liquid gel and
you sort of use emit so I just use the
mitt that I'm about to use like oils my
buddy and I just apply it all of the
face and I do like one sheet one cheek
and then forehead and I sort of blend it
over the center and it basically says it
has always wear gloves apply a very
small amount evenly Kat is just making a
way to apply a very small amount even
meat to the face and net for a deeper
darker color repeat so I pretty much as
follow those instructions so I used
admit and I applied one layer on the
face and because it was like transparent
I was like okay I'm going to do two so I
applied a second layer and then I left
it on it overnight and I woke up the
next morning and it just looked really
lovely like because it's obviously a gel
and not a mousse which is what I'm using
it doesn't feel as dry in like it's
almost like it moisturizes my skin a
little bit at the same time and I feel
like this lasts longer on my face
because that was another issue with the
loving time like even though it lasts
really long my body I felt like it came
off quite quickly on my face makeup
blends really well on top of it it just
feels good it looks good it looks even
it just makes me look healthy and it
makes my face to match my body which so
obviously like what you want so for
anyone who is after a good fake tan for
last face this is the one to go for I
would set in terms of hair I forgot to
say actually I have just had my roots
done so if I look a bit crazy like over
here or like in general anywhere it's
because I literally got my roots on
yesterday and the dyes like not worn off
unlike the little bits on my skull oh
hello I have been loving it using it
these two oils recently I kind of has
mix and match between the two and one is
by job and it is that advanced time
series for general regenerate
nourishment for damaged extremely
distressed hair and it's a serum in oil
at the sub site so it's got a really
cool bottle and then this one is by
parity and read and this is their smooth
sealed and sensational volumizing no oil
oil for fine hair
muscle I just think heralds are so good
so I basically wash my hair at normal
and then I get out the shower or the
bath or whatever and it basically says
on the back with this one which is the
person read you work once two drops of
the oil through towel dried hair and
and it's simile like this one's like
three to four pumps for the color at the
same thing exactly what do I basically
wait for my house tell Giles I have it
up in a towel and and then after a while
I'll take it down brush it and then I
apply later mostly at like the top of my
hat because I notice recently like I was
getting quite frizzy hair like towards
the top and I don't really know why like
my hair is quite long and so the ice I
don't do a lot intensive tasks am quite
lazy because it just grows and I feel
lucky that it does just grow but these
are so good it just like came in at the
fridge so that once I've dried it like
whether I dry it naturally or with a
hair dryer it just looks a lot more
healthier it's got like a little bit
more shine to it it's not frizzy it just
feels softer and healthier and better
you know that's what we want okay we've
got two more things to go so onto skin
care the first one is by circle glory
and this is their face soap and Clara c3
and one daily detox vitamin C facial
wash and it looks like service it says
squeeze a great sized measure this
fabulous faced up and clarity onto damp
skin rub into a lava and then rinse
follow with an eye cream moisturizer and
spot treatment if needed which is
basically what I do so I use this every
time I cleanse my skin at the minute and
I've just really been enjoying it and I
felt like I just didn't really have as a
good cleanser for a while and I was like
on the hunt for one and then I have this
that so one grows very friendly and open
PR not so long ago and I gave it a go
and I really enjoy it because it's like
a cleanser but I don't know if you can
see and you can see like the sort of
little particles in it that are like
exfoliating I would say so it kind of
does like a two-in-one it does it's a
three-in-one so you know it says it
smooths cleans and purifies which I
would agree with it's just nice and
gentle like it's not an extreme
exfoliator in the sense that you can't
use it as a daily cleanser like asking
you can use this like evening and
morning or morn Indonesian it just works
really well it smells nice feels very
sort of sick and jelly it's quite like
cool in in my opinion which I really
like and I'm just been enjoying doing it
what using it looks a very last thing
that I want to mention these are epsom
salts and they look like so so these you
can get these from like Sainsbury's
maybe and I call in the ferret-like
I think I got mine from Amazon and but
they are basically salts that you put in
the bath and it's essentially our sueded
and detoxifying and they help to relax
stiff and achy neck muscles excellent
when used after sports and exercise
which is exactly what I've got them for
because if you know if you follow me on
social media you will know that I have
recently got a personal trainer so I'm
doing a lot more like exercise and right
now I know they are really enjoying it
but it's like hard work in the sense
that my muscles will just ate some days
and also pay it so this is so good to
just put in the bath it basically says
dissolve in a bath of 37 to 39 8 degrees
C and soak for 20 minutes and then it
does give you measurements as well it
says for aching muscles use 200 grams to
one kilogram of salt per regular sized
fast so I pretty much I don't measure it
I just work it it doesn't do anything to
your bath because it's just like salt
and but the morning after I can really
tell when I've had a bath using these
because I definitely do feel like a lot
more soothed and relaxed like my muscles
aren't stiff and achy and it's just
really good for like sort of relaxing
soothing after workout yeah I just been
moving and having a hot bath walking
these in and then having like a really
nice cold water to make sure that I keep
hydrated because that's really important
in the bath especially if you having a
hot one and and I just have a definite
rest amendment so boys and girls that
was all of my current must-haves and
faves I really hope you all enjoyed this
video and let me help you China any of
these products or let me know you've
been love them recently because I would
love to try some like new skincare or
some new like makeup products if there's
anything that anyone recommend I'm going
to go anyway because my throat's sore
and sore and it's really soon
talk so thank you so much for watching I
love you go to the moon and back and I
will see you in next week leo but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
