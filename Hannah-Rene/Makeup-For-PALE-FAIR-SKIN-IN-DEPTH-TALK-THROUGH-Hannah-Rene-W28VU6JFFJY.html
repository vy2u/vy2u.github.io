hey guys it's Han so today's video is
going to be a makeup tutorial on this
look right here which I'm actually
recreating a photo that I posted on
Instagram because it was it's not my
most like start on Instagram which is
crazy
so it is this photo right here so that
is the look right there as I said it
literally is just this makeup I had so
many comments like honestly asking me to
recreate this it also goes boom start
don't my my way I also posted on
snapchat and ask people to screenshot if
they wanted to see it and it got tons of
screenshots as well so I'm assuming you
do so this is pretty much my go-to
makeup when I've got no fate turn on and
I'm a little bit fairer which I know I'm
not the fairest person in the world but
for me this is quite pale because I do
usually wear fake tan and things like
that but to be honest I've not been
wearing it as much recently and I've
kind of been embracing the paleness I
guess so this is what I tend to wear I
really hope you all like it this is
quite an in-depth video I did put
through a lot of stuff as to why are you
certain products and you know what sort
of colors I like to wear and things like
that so go get a drink in a snack sit
down let me know if nothing you drink is
in the comments because I would love to
know and because yeah it's probably
gonna be quite chatty but yeah I really
hope you all like the look that I am
wearing and they said this is kind of a
go-to for me so I hope it helps some of
you out you are a little bit fairer and
a little bit more pale and if you want
to see how I achieved it then just keep
watching so we're going to start with
foundation today just because that's
what I'm feeling I'm also gonna do a
wing and like a tiny bit of eye shadow
so don't need to start with eyes first a
lot of people asked what foundation I
was using because obviously I completely
agree with this as well I feel like when
the people who are a little bit of
ferreting skin is so hard to find a
foundation that does a shade light and
all if you know I mean I understand as
well I am NOT like the palest of the
pale I feel like my face is because it
never sees any Sun and what my body
isn't too bad and obviously you want to
match your foundation to body anyway one
thing I always bear in mind when I'm
buying a foundation for when I've got
like no feet turn on and when I'm like
pale is to make sure we've got a yellow
undertone because if you can see I'll
zoom in a little bit as you can see like
my face compared to my
that is way more pinky so I always like
to make sure that my foundation matches
this sort of olive undertone here rather
than the pink that the pinky turns on my
skin it's not like crazy different but
you can definitely tell and when I wipe
it like a pink tone foundation I just
hate the look of it so I make sure I get
an all foundation so that it matches my
neck and that also looks more fluttering
in my opinion anyway I'm going to use a
couple of just one so this is the Becca
ultimate coverage complexion cream I've
mentioned this a couple of times really
good foundation very full coverage and
very sick so that's why I mixes is in
the shade shell and it's a really lovely
yellow toned fat foundation so I use it
this one and then I also use the Make Up
For Ever Ultra HD liquid foundation I
don't like this on its own as a lot of
you all know I love the stick by itself
but this just looks wrong on my skin on
its own for some reason it's quite share
I don't want to share but it's a lighter
coverage I would say which is why I mix
a tube they work so well and this one is
in the shade Y to 35 so they're both
quite yellow tone as you can probably
see with the makeup for ever one you
won't be able to tell with that one and
if I mix those together and then
recently I've been added in the Marc
Jacobs dewdrops in the shade do you not
something that you have to do but
because this foundation is kind of quite
like a natural to matte finish I just
add in like a liquid illuminator it
doesn't matter which one and you don't
have to that you don't want to but this
is the one I'm using because again it's
got like a more yellow all of you tones
wear so I will be mixing those on the
back or just any palette you can do it
on the back of your hand as well if you
want to but I do like half a pump of
this two pumps of the Make Up For Ever
one I always do more than make up for
everyone because you literally need a
lot of this like the tiny spit and then
I just do a small pump of the dewdrop as
well there's a primary doesn't really
matter what primer you use I'm going to
be using the Galan Gold primer I still
don't know the name of this Lord /
brilliant concentrate with smuggle I
know it's expensive and stuff I bought
it now and I'm really enjoying it so I'm
going to use this but don't feel like
you have to use like a expensive F Prime
really oh my you see I used to love
using the Nivea men sociable and I still
do use our obviously it's like two
pounds from boots and sook-ja but not
prime man but it does the job L'Oreal is
well do go primers Ren will do really
good primers their last and finish one
is my favorite one it's so good the one
with the right top I think it's lasting
finish I am really enjoying it locally
those of you who are in the market for
like a higher-end primer it feels so wet
on the skin which I like because my skin
is normal to dry I'm considering I'm
going in with such a heavy foundation
anyway as one of the foundations I'm
using and I like to make sure that I've
got a good hydrated base that is what
all of that looks like on the back of
the palais you can kind of see the
difference between each product i'm
first going to apply it with a looksie
504 angled large angled brush i got a
lot of questions on this brush and I
always forget to link it and so really
the foundation brush for when you want
to apply something yonex be too heavy so
I just mix them all together I'm just
going to start going on like so do you
just go in with a buffing brush as well
once it's just first just to like press
it into the skin because I feel like
this leaves like a look like sometimes
brush streets and stuff so I like to
make sure it's all settled in nicely but
yeah I quite like that it's still quite
yellow toned because the foundation that
I would wear if I had baked on on would
be yellow tone so it makes me feel like
not as fast can do the eyelids a little
bit and I'm just building also tiny bit
where I feel like I need the extra
coverage which is basically my whole
face let's be honest okay so that is the
initial base like the initial layer
foundation the next thing I'm going to
do is cream contour so this is like a
new additional step that I've been doing
and I'm going to take the UH Nastasia
cream contour kit and this is in the
shade fair this is what I use the other
day in that photo and it was the first
time I've used this one I've really
loved it I actually took a lot of people
tips from the first impressions video as
well I mixed in a facial oil which I'll
show you in a tip but I am just using
this shade here which is the center
shade is called shadow and the
face oil that I use is the Loreal
extraordinary facial oil it just looks
like so so from L'Oreal nice and
affordable and I literally just applied
it's like a prepare like dropper and I
just do one drop in the pan and that's
it and then I start playing it with a
brush I do half of my face and then I
apply a second drop because by the time
I was like when blending and stuff it's
kind of dried up again and I just apply
it another drop for the other part of my
face and it works so much better
excellence way easier which we'll see in
a fat thank you to everyone who promised
to do that because I would not have
thought to to apply it I'm just using a
makeup forever and one for for wavy
brush it just looks like so it's like a
dinky kind of concealer and flat shader
brush situation so I'm just going to use
that to apply and then to blend out I'm
just going to use my Real Techniques
buffing brush which I love and I just
kind of like mix it in with the brush
and like all over the pan which is why
the pans a little bit messy as you
probably saw the floor and then we're
going to do from the top of the air down
to the corner of the mouth and then also
temples and jawline as well so we're
going to do that up here not like too
much and then also do a line right up to
there I started doing this a little bit
because I feel like it makes my jaw line
pop a little bit more when I do like the
very corner here and then you just want
to start blending now this would be like
it just blends so much better than what
it did in that first impression video I
don't really like to do a warm cream
contour when I've got like no quick turn
on because I feel like it looks too warm
on the skin and I feel like this just
works better so it just adds a little
bit of definition you can see like this
I come back to that side so I'm just
going to do the same head on the same
hat the same thing on the other side of
concealer when I've got no pitkannan and
I'm this skin tone I like to mix too so
I use the bone this way by Too Faced in
the shade very far the only thing I
don't like about this concealer is that
the very fair shade it's quite pink
toned which is why I mix it with this
one which is the Make Up For Ever Ultra
HD and concealer in the shade of white
21 and this is genuinely the palest
concealer I've ever owned like it's so
payroll this one I love the formula Roth
really creamy it blends out really
nicely not too heavy this one I'm not a
massive fan of the formula it's probably
one of the only Korean products that I
don't love from Make Up For Ever just
because it's so thick like it's such a
thick heavy full coverage concealer that
I really struggle to wear this under the
eyes because it does go super cakey
which is right and mix it a little bit
with this one because this has a more
liquidy like element to it so I'm going
to basically apply this one the two
phase one under my eyes first and then I
apply the makeup for everyone on the
back of my hand and I kind of mix it
with my finger I sort of rub it on the
back of my hand to warm up the product
and then I apply it on top of the two
phase one and that warmth helps to blend
it out a little bit more no I'm just
going to say it with the RCM a which has
been a Laura Mercier Club
make sure there's no creases and then
just going to blend the Too Faced one
out I don't want to put in the makeup
for everyone on the rest of my skin just
see his I only really use it under the
eyes because it's a lighter shade so it
brightens the highlight whereas I kind
of just use for two this one by itself
on the rest of the stage okay so this is
the skin pretty much done we're just
going to set it in the move onto powder
products so today I'm going to use my
Rimmel stay matte which is my one of my
favorite press palette this brush is
just by new look it's one of the only
ones I kept because I did really like
this brush it's just like a big powder
brush this foundation like I said it
doesn't really need a lot of stuff in
because it is a little bit more on the
matte side so I'm just kind of like
preparing everything for like auto part
of products okay so I'm going to do
brows off camera I'm just going to use a
mix of the goof proof by benefit in the
shade 5 and then I'm also going to use
the browse by a Nastasia for the front
of the brow I've actually not used
powder in a while I've been using a
pencil to do the front of my brows like
create the natural hairs and so using
the brow is in dark brown and then just
a staff in jail right and then in terms
of eyes I just keep it really simple I
basically do a tiny bit of shadow and
then any big winged liner because I
always feel I'm most confident in like a
big winged liner so
finding one honestly doesn't matter why
I shadows you put in the crease because
that's all I'm going to do I'm just
going to put some shadows in the crease
and then something underneath and I'm
just going to use one warm brown so this
is the modern renaissance I'm just going
to use raw Sienna I'm just going to put
that in the crease endings or maybe put
a little bit of this red shade in as
well which I never knowed but now it's
quite real good but yeah I'm not going
to bother with anything like on the lid
and things I'm just going to throw
something in the crease you could even
use like the bronzer that you're going
to apply it a little bit later on yeah
that'll do I won't put anything else and
I'll just use raw Sienna and then you
just want to pop that underneath the
eyes as well for a little bit of
definition up for you if you use warm
Browns or cool grounds and because the
rest of the face is a little bit cooler
I'm just putting warm shades on the eyes
also because I've got like blue-green
eyes to be congruent a little bit lesser
and then like I said I just do a big
winged liner so the liner that I've been
doing using at the minute is the makeup
forever ink liner which looks like so
just because I was using the Sigma gel
which I really love but when I'm doing a
look like this and I've not got many
shadows in the crease I feel like it it
actually transfers a lot throughout the
day into my crease and just because
there's not much part of there so like
keep it locked in I'm just going to
start here at the corner and then drag
it out to the tail of the brow okay so I
made a bit of a mess of that but it's
fine and then I literally just drag it
all the way across
like literally a sick wing just feel
like if you've not got many eyeshadows
on then you can get away with a sick
wing because it's not like covering
anything on the lid okay so I'm just
going to clean this wings up and do the
other one off camera and then I'm also
going to do lashes which are what lashes
I wear I'm going to use the Amber Rose
toffee lashes just because I've really
been loving these at the minute even
though the elbows the less lash I really
love these lashes so I'm going to put
these on and finish the wings off
off-camera and I'm also just going to do
bottom lash mascara so pretty much just
finish off the eyes okay so eyes are
done I just popped some lashes on and
these aren't actually the lashes that I
wore in that picture if you want to copy
that picture exactly then it is lower
lashes Jing makeup but these are pretty
similar in my opinion and then to finish
our fridges need to do runs our
highlighter and lips so a lot bronzer
I'm going to use the soap &amp;amp; Glory solar
powder this is one of my favorites to
use when I am a little bit fairer and
skin just because it has more fairer
shade here and I don't find it to be too
warm which I like because I don't want
anything orangey and then the brush
Lebanese is the backstage beauty brush
in the angled powder I mean no offense
is the angled powder by backstage and
beauty it's really good for just like
all over bronze it I was kind of swell a
little bit I don't really mind if I pick
up the darker shade as well I find it
quite natural I'm just going to apply it
on top of the UNASUR vehicons okay I'm
not going to apply too much like so I'm
just gonna do jawline a gun okay so that
is what that looks like nice and natural
not too warm like I said I love this
combination when I've got a fire escape
I think it works so well highlight my
favorite to use when again and Sarah is
the urban decay stain and I did see a
question and when I mentioned this in
like a favorite video not so long ago
about what brush I used to apply it
because a normal thing that they don't
find it's very pigmented whereas I find
the complete opposite so this is by
Sigma and this is the tapered
highlighter brush and this is my
favorite brush to highlight in it's so
good and it just applies product really
intense but like not heavy like it still
went out really well so I'm just going
to get my brush in and get like a photo
of it on just looks like so I just did
like a
love back and forth and then I do talk
on a hosta access and then like I like I
can't you know easy at you see it's that
I've just applied way too much but that
just shows you how intense is and then
for blush I'm going to use NARS luster
because I find this is this is that yeah
I find this relatively natural and it
kind of just ties with two together
really nicely and it also adds a little
bit of warmth because it is a more card
coral shape so it kind of like as the
warmth toward the highlighter and the
bronzer Joe onto lips when I am a little
bit fairer I feel like it's about that
every product I start with when I'm a
little bit far out normally our well
about know if it can on a worm a bit
Sarah I like to wear a lip that's a
little bit darker just because I feel
especially when I've got pretty much
nothing on the eye for winged I feel
like a slightly darker lip really makes
it pop and so I'm going to recreate the
one that I wore in the photo for the
purpose of this video but anything will
work when I went to show Amanda's or the
night I wore a dark red and I wore
two-faced drop-dead red and that stayed
on and looked really lovely with the
skin and with the one that I wore in the
photo however is well lip pencil by Mac
so I use that to line my lips and then
the two liquid lipsticks that i use a by
Kylie cosmetics basically mixed
love-bite which is kind of a dark purple
more looks like the color of a love bite
and then also Dolce K which is a little
bit more Brown oh just mix the two
together on the lips I started with love
bite and there went on top with Dolce K
because la fight was a little bit too
dark for what I want it so like I said
I'm just going to start with well lip
liner which is by Mac and this is a
lovely lip liner it's got a really nice
purple tone to it and I'm just going to
use this to line and slightly over draw
my lips because that is the sort of
effect that I like whenever I over draw
my lips I always over draw it in the
center as well I never do the outside
because it changes like your expression
sounds really silly but I never like
over draw on this portion because it
just makes it look daft so I always
overdrawn my Cupid's bow and the very
bottom of my Center the center of my
bottom lip and I always make sure I
bring it
and it creates the fullness in the
center but it still makes it look kind
of believable I guess yeah you can see
it creates like the fullness in the
center but it makes sure it's not it
doesn't make you look silly you know you
don't look like you've got climates you
know you'd be honest you notice that
little bit and I'm going to just pop it
here
and then I'm going to go in with dr. kay
and just go over top and I'm going to do
my full lip with this I mean you
probably don't need to do the look like
that but I'm just making sure that I
recreate that look as closely as
possible so lies what I did that day and
this is where I go in and make sure I do
like right around to the lip line to
make sure I do the topic neatly I flip
the brush on the like a doe foot sorry
on the back and I use some mulling
inside to get right up to keep itself
and that is pretty much the finished
look so this is everything I did in
everything I wore to achieve the look
that you saw on Instagram I really hope
you all loved it give a massive thumbs
up if you do and subscribe if you're not
already and let me know what else you
would like to see in the comments down
below other than that I don't think have
anything else to say so I really hope
you all enjoyed it
thank you so much for watching and the
guys coming back and I will see you in
sunday's video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
