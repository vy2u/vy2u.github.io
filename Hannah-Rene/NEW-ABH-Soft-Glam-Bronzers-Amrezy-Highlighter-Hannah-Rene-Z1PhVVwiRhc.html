back so today's video is going to be a
kind of a testing video we're gonna be
testing out some new products as you can
see I've already got part of my makeup
on so we're only gonna be testing a
couple of products and it's gonna be all
of the new Anastasi at Beverly Hills
stuff so we've got the soft glam palette
which I have to say when I saw this
online it looked like my favorite
palette that they've released yeah I
even lost the modernise on like the
colors just look gorgeous so I'm so
excited to try this and then we've also
got the bronzers I picked up the shade
saddle it's kind of hard to buy bronzers
online it's kind of hard to choose your
shade so hopefully that'll be okay and
then we've also got the UH Nastasia in
collaboration with a more easy
highlighter which I did actually got in
PR and I've restrained promit using
because I wanted to save it for a video
where I could use all three so fucking
hard this time
so yeah I look like a bit of a crazy
person because I've got eyebrows and
babies and lips and nothing else
so I think we're gonna start with eyes
just in case there's any fallout or
anything like that so I'm gonna dip into
a soft glam let me know in the comments
if you've used any of these products yet
because I would love to know people's
thoughts I've seen pretty mixed opinions
so far so I'm hoping that I'm gonna love
them so when you open it up you got a
why do I always think I can hear noises
in my room it's so freaky you got a
brush which I do use this brush I use it
mostly for inner corner highlight which
is so random but I feel like the fluffy
side works really well and then this is
what the actual palette looks like so
pretty I'm actually obsessed I love that
it's got a black I feel like the one
sort of shade that Modern Renaissance
luxe is a black and I love the fact that
most of the shades are quite warm and
rosy and like rich Browns I absolutely
love that she's my cuppa tea I'm gonna
swatch a couple so it's got orange soda
and burnt orange burnt orange I believe
is in Modern Renaissance as well and
these do come as singles - I believe so
I'm pretty sure there are maybe a couple
that are exclusive to the palette but
some of them you can buy individually as
well and I purchased this on the UK site
for 45 pounds I think it was or 40
pounds yes I purchased the palette on it
the bronzer but the highlight with scent
MPR so just gonna shuffle up a little
bit I'm gonna start with burn orange I
think which is this shade here burnt
orange is a tiny bit darker than orange
so
it's also a little bit like more of a
brown rather than an orange I would say
I do always find uh Nastasia shadows to
be quite powdery which isn't necessarily
a bad thing I feel like when what was it
called subculture
I call it suburbia once in a video and
everyone was like oh no what the fuck it
was so called to once I've got to came
out everyone was like just hate in it
because of how powder it was and it just
didn't blend well at all I've always
found understands your eyeshadows to be
quite powdery I don't know if it's just
me
I noticed it with modern renascence as
well like you do get a lot of kickback
in the pan just something to bear in
mind and you really don't need a lot I
don't know if you can see what the color
goes I'm pretty intense so just gonna
dust this in the crease
I've got like so many hairs on my face I
don't know what that's about my skin
looks extra giant given it I don't know
what it is and I don't know what what to
do to fix it actually went for a facial
you're more you're add a dot you know I
was pronouncing your @m you are ad your
ad anyone's heard of them
oh my gosh I went for a facial the other
day it was like the most fascinating
thing because it was in chocolate Center
in Dublin it ends and they basically
have like this little machine that takes
a photo of your face and can kind of
examine your skin like more thoroughly
than what the eye can do if that makes
sense so she was talking to me about how
because I don't use a lot of SPF because
I live in Manchester like we don't get a
lot of Sun and you just assume not to
use SPF when it's not sunny - it's like
no you need to use it all the time
because it protects your skin and she
was talking about how like sun damage
and like the lack of SPF I use is really
damaging my skin and I was like oh my
god that was such a sidetrack anyway
even orange is just a staple or like
everyone needs a burnt orange you know I
mean hey what to do next I think I'm
gonna go in with Sienna which is just
the shade next to where I'm sure this is
in like another palette that they do
maybe or maybe I just have this as a
single I've definitely seen it before I
don't really know what kind of look I'm
doing to be quite honest I'm just gonna
apply that to the outer corner I don't
want to do anything too crazy today
because I'm going and I'm driving later
to an event
benefits like an overnight stay at the
Leicester Space Center which I'm so
excited about such like a cold trip
obviously to celebrate and the new
mascara bad girl bunks it's all kind of
like space themed and stuff so I need
this makeup to look good okay and I
started the art and relying on yeah yeah
I know I'm so excited I need some luck
more like I've logged the other day
because I got my lips topped up which
you can't probably got currently sell
because I've got makeup on um i vlog
about the other day because a couple of
people are asking about it and stuff and
said that it'd make a cool vlog so I
need to edit that well in general I just
need to vlog more like I'm so bad just
gonna go in with a little bit more so
far so good I love this color it's just
like a rich chocolate II like maroon and
then when it's my blending brush just go
back in no no additional product just to
soften that out I always like to sort
over when it's a darker shade I always
like to pack it on with a tapered brush
but then go back in with a blending
brush to soften it gonna go in with a
touch more of burnt orange just to blend
that out interested in yeah they're
taking a little bit more blending then I
would like them to especially this dark
one I don't know it's taking a little
bit more blending than I would usually
have to put in like it's kind of
sticking to the skin a little bit it's
nothing crazy but it's just like I don't
know if you can see here just sticking
to the skin a bit like it's harder to
sort of smudge out and what Shea to use
next I'm gonna go in with mulberry which
is this shade here it's kind of like a
dark mulberry cut a little bit more rich
again tap off the excess so far we've
not had too much fallout which thank God
because I've not actually put any powder
underneath the Scotch it's just sticking
down a little bit more than I would like
it to which is strange because I have
set my eye is like I set them a lot with
powder
it's not the worst thing in the world
it's just taking a little bit more work
it's strange because with like modern
Renaissance or example that is such a
quick and easy palette for me like I can
just walk that on and do like a really
quick eye look and that's what I love
about air or is this it's just taking a
little bit more work which is fine in
like if you've got the time Stuart
because it colors absolutely Stern it
okay I feel like now that we've worked
with it a bit it looks fairly good I'm
pretty happy with that the color looks
really nice I don't know what to do for
the lid because not many of these shades
I like speaking to me for the lid
they're quite that either really yellow
we got old or pink okay I'm just gonna
mix fairy and glisten in which are the
two palest shimmers that I'm just going
to use a brush just gonna use a Mac two
for two I think this is yeah okay we've
got some fallout very pretty though oh
that looks really nice yeah actually
look really nice
they look very pretty indeed look under
I'm just gonna mix burnt orange and a
little bit of sienna okay and then if
you want to do a wing you can I'm not
gonna do a wing today I'm just gonna
take some of the black and smudge that
into the lash line and then do lashes
you just want to take a flat definer
brush and I'm gonna take the shade know
what and I'm just gonna push that into
the lash line just so that the lashes
have got something to blend with okay so
that is how the eyes are looking I'm
just gonna go and do it lashes and
mascara
I've camera and I'll be back in a sec
okay so those are the eyes all drawn I'm
actually really happy with them now that
they're done yeah they look really good
so on to bronzer and highlighter those
the only tea products we've got left to
try these are powder bronzers it says
powder bronzer for face and body creates
a natural matte choiceless finish for
buildable coverage so as I said I got
the shade it's a doll I'm hoping it's
gonna be the right shade it's really
hard to tell on line oh it sure looks
dark right we're just gonna use the
light hon gonna use a Mac 125 because
that's what I always used to runs out
I'm actually shifting myself now because
that is a way darker than white expect
it to be I'm gonna use a tiny bit on the
cheekbone
smells good okay
not too bad cool is nice like not too
orange not too rad okay probably a quite
a bit too much that I can't feels really
soft on the skin it's blending out quite
well with the base that we've got on
yeah quite like that cool is not to talk
either and you just use a light Hutton's
and you know probably gonna bit
heavy-handed this side but it is what it
is I actually like that blended really
easily looks really seamless on the skin
yeah that looks really good that's
really like that a lot okay and then it
last but not least this is the thing I'm
most excited for is the Army's
highlighter so I'm just gonna use the
same brush that i always use let's just
do a little swatch looks so pretty this
is a sigma f-35 I love that the puns
like wavy oh wow that is so nice that's
really pretty
reminds me a lot again it's like my
makeup forever
pro light fusion in terms of the color
is locks it's definitely more like gold
so that's really nice it's a little bit
lighter
I think than my makeup forever and my
L'Oreal one bit more like a champagne
gold I mean that is pretty intense I'm
pretty happy with this makeup what are
we saying I'm pretty happy with the way
this is come out oh the bronzer and the
highlighter I'm pretty sure the bronzer
was like I want to say it with 30 pounds
was it 30 pounds because that is a lot
for a bronzer and I don't know say it so
it's not have a feeling just 30 pounds
I'll leave links that everything down
below if you're interested in any of it
but I'm pretty sure because I'm pretty
sure my toe all came to about 75 pounds
or so for like the palette on the
highlight the bronzer so all in all I
actually do really like the palette now
that the eyes are done I feel like the
darker shade really helped out at the
end it kind of blended a lot more I
don't know easier than the previous
shade the Sienna shade definitely takes
a little bit more work than something
compared to my modern renaissance for
example but if you are someone that
loves makeup and really likes the colors
in the palette I
would recommend it because even though
you have to like work with it a little
bit it does crate like I'm really pretty
low highlighter absolutely love the
bronzer I'm really happy with it as well
like it's not actually too dark no
that's on the skin feel like as long as
you use a light hand it's absolutely
fine I like that it's not too warm like
it doesn't look too orange or anything
like that so yeah I'm pretty bloody
happy let me know if you tried any of
these products in the comments down
below because I would love to know of
course I'm gonna go anyway because I've
gotta get ready and go to benefit so
thank you so much for watching I love
you guys to the moon back a million
times over and I'll see you in the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
