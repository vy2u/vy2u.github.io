makeup tutorial on this look right here
I am feeling this look so I basically
sat down and in my mind I knew I wanted
to do another double cut crease because
another double got grooms because I'm
pre filming this I'm actually filming
this at the end of November but it's not
going to go up until the end of December
because I am filming a New Year's Eve
look today I wanted to do something
really glam really just like öthey tea
I wanted to have a lot of glitter going
on I wanted to do another double cut
crease because my first one of these did
really well and you all loved it so I
thought I'd do something similar but
just a completely different take on it
something that's a bit more like
Christmas appropriate and like winter
appropriate with the Reds and the
silvers there's some glitter in the
crease I am so excited for this look I
love it so much I really hope you guys
like it as well I'm gonna do it as a
talk through and I'm gonna try and talk
through every single stab eyes best as
they come because I don't want anyone to
look at this and think that it's
intimidating or and that it's gonna be
hard to do because honestly it's just
the sort of lock that it's easiest to do
it's all this not easy to do but it just
takes a lot of time so please don't be
like puff if you feel like this looks
really intimidating and scary and hard
to do because I promise you it's not I
actually loved the fact that when I did
my last double cut crease so many people
like the most I've ever had tweeted me
and tagged me in the photos it means to
grab my favorite recreations of it I
absolutely love that so please feel free
to do the same again because I love
seeing your guys like recreations of my
looks that I do so I really hope you
like it give a massive thumbs up if you
do if you want to see how I got it then
just keep watching and I realize I mean
like a dressing-down and also a choke
because it's like a diamond choker I'll
link this down below because I know a
lot people can ask well it's from
Windsor store I like some diamond
brawler
on the go as well excuse my honeys Ally
really dark yo yeah I linked all of this
down below don't mind the fact that I'm
just in a dressing gown and a diamonds
rhinestone choker I feel like that just
sums up me as a person yeah I love you
guys so much I hope you had a wonderful
Christmas because you will be watching
this after Christmas which is crazy to
think about it's not even summer yet
when I'm filming this but yeah I hope
you had a lovely Christmas and got
everything that you wanted I hope you
have a wonderful New Year's because I
won't speak to on this channel until
2017 now so have an amazing New Year's
Eve be safe have lots of fun yeah I'm
gonna stop talking I realize this
interesting so so long I love you let's
go okay so starting with eyes I've
already got them primed with some soft
ochre by Mac I'm now taking the modern
renaissance palette by anastasiya and
I'm starting with the sort of medium
brown which is called burn orange I want
to say or maybe I've made that up anyway
we're gonna start cutting the second
crease so the best way for me to explain
this or like describe how to do it is to
basically just mimic your actual crease
but a step above your eye so just copy
the same shape as your natural crease so
mine is quite rounded so I'm creating
like the rounded shape and then you want
to flick it out towards the end if you
don't have like a naturally defined
crease then just make a second one above
where you want you first want to be if
that makes sense because I know not
everyone has a really defined crease so
just create one where you think is about
right and then you want to start taking
a blending brush I'm using a c-17 by Mac
and you want to start blending the edges
I started off with no product on the
brush just to blend that initial line
and then I do add a little bit more of
the product just to help blend it and so
we got a nice gradient effect because
that is what we are going for here even
though a cut crease is quite structured
and defined and sharp you really want
the edges to be nice and blurred and
soft and blended as always so yeah just
taken a little bit of time this is what
I meant when I said it's a
time-consuming look because you honestly
need to pick up the smallest amount of
product because the minute you going
with too much it's really hard to blend
out so just take a bit at a time and
you'll be absolutely fine
then I'm mixing the two Reds because we
are creating quite a red cut crease
today seeing as this is for like
Christmas and New Year's Eve time and so
I'm just doing the exact same steps so
taking the small angled liner brush
I'll have all
she's a link down below and copying the
same shape so just going over it and
then again I'm taking it the blending
brush I'm not taking any of the Reds yet
just because they are very vibrant
colors the anastasi eyeshadows in
particular are so pigmented so I'm just
using some of the burnt orange shade
first and then I'm gonna go in with a
little bit the red as well
I do switch brush in a minute as well
because the t17 it was too fluffy for
what I was trying to do and I felt like
it was just distributing product where I
didn't want it so I do switch brush as
you can see here I can't remember the
name of this I know it's by Sigma but
I'll have all brushes linked down below
just because it was more precise and
dense and the bristles when as fluffy as
you can see so it's sort of blending it
but it's not putting products where I
don't want it to be because the issue
with a fluffy brush is it just blends it
all out quite not precisely quite I
don't really know what what I'm looking
for but it isn't very precise obviously
so I just wanted something a little bit
more dense to keep everything why it was
supposed to be and then I'm taking a two
to four with no product on it this hit
this hair is a really good trick just to
lift your eyebrows it just helps to
stretch the skin and make sure that
everything is nice and blended and
smooth and then we're gonna go in with
some concealer and clean up all of our
mistakes so don't worry if you weren't
like sort of precise enough with this
and you blended it quite far down I'm
just cleaning up with some prolong wet
you can use either a cream or a liquid
concealer for this I prefer a liquid
just because I think it's easier to sort
of maneuver and blend and reason
let's look cute brush by Mac which I
can't remember the name of or the number
up but I will link it down below you
just want something quite little and
precise just to make sure you can get in
all of the nooks and crannies and this
is a really good opportunity just to
make sure that both sides are even in
shape so you can sort of go back in and
keep looking in the mirror and making
sure that both of them are even and then
for the actual wing I'm using a liquid
lipstick by Mac if you have a red
eyeliner then obviously can use that but
I don't have one so I am just using a
liquid lipstick because they have no
issue using these on my eyes just doing
the wing shape first so you just want to
follow the same sort of shape that we
did with the eye shadow I'm starting out
with the more sort of like darker one
but then I realized that was a little
bit too pinky for what I was going for
so I do switch back towards the lighter
one but I can't remember the names of
either so I will listen
below I'm just using an angled liner
brush again this is by Sigma and you
basically want to start creating the
second crease like your actual lower
crease so I'm starting off with the wing
just because I feel like this is the
hardest bit just making sure that is
laid down and I'm beginning to fill it
in because the whole of the lid area
will be red eventually and then the way
I like to do is I start with the inner
corner first and I sort of position my
head so that I'm looking down into the
mirror just so that I can see my exact
crease and again if you don't have one
or if you don't have one that's very
defined and this is your opportunity
just to create one where you want it to
be just make sure that there's a nice
amount of space between the upper and
the lower one just so you can fit some
glitter in that later and then I'm going
back in with the deep red shadow from
the Anastasio palette and I'm placing
that over the liquid lipstick just to
set it and then also to blend it into
the shadow that we're about to use I
decided that I wanted the outer parts of
the lid to be matte so I'm using the
dark red there and then I wanted to use
a shimmery eyeshadow in the center so
make sure you keep everything in the
line that is why we've done that sort of
lying there with the liquid lipstick it
just helps to keep everything in place
and everything what you want it to be
and it's a nice guide for when you doing
your eye shadow because it makes it so
much easier and then I'm taking a bit of
shadow insurance by Too Faced and
whipping out this cheeky little number
I'm obsessed with this eye shadow
expired makeup geek it's one of the
foiled ones in the shady curtaincall and
honestly like it's just so stunning like
if you need a Vibram shimmery rather
than this right here is what you needs
and I did pair it with a more gold one
as well which I can't remember the name
of but I'll link it down below as always
I kind of wish I hunt on this I felt
like I was just trying to do too many
things at once and I wish I just kept it
rad I kind of wanted to add it so it
would like pop and it'd be a little bit
lighter in the center and don't mind it
but looking at now like I wish I had
just on the red so that's up to you if
you want to do a bit of gold or not and
then we're doing the fun part I'm just
placing some shadow insurance down in
the actual sort of space between the
creases and then I'm just patting some
Engler glitter and again I have no idea
what this is but I Willis it down below
this worked perfectly because it's so
finely milled that it didn't drop on
solid or like ruin the eyes throughout
the day so I would definitely recommend
it I'm just patting it down with an
angled brush like so and I felt like
this really just sort of completed the
look I'm
action glam your eyes should then it
look something like this and then we are
nearly finished I'm just finishing off
with some liquid not liquid sorry some
like black gel liner just on the upper
lashes I do this every single time I do
any eye look no matter what it is just
because if I'm gonna be wearing falsies
it just helps to match my natural lashes
with my false ones so I'm just popping
it some of that on and then I did do
false eyelashes off camera I use the J
makeup by Lily lashes just because of my
favorite ones the nice and fluttery and
wispy and they fit really nicely and
they're very comfortable to wear on the
eyes in my opinion I'm just cleaning up
underneath because some of the shadow
did fall down but that is the perks of
doing eyes first it's nice and easy to
clean up then I'm using and a bit of
Nivea man post shave balm just as a
primer you guys know I love this and
then answer foundation I am using it the
Make Up For Ever HD sick which I know so
many people get annoyed in the comments
because I use this 24/7 but I can't help
it
like nothing works as Godwin the skin I
promise I'm gonna try and find something
back in the new year though or try and
mix it up a little bit more I'm just
mixing it two shades because one's too
dark and one is too pale just because
I've not got tons of fake tan on at the
minute it seems to sort of wear off on
my neck and chest quite quickly and but
yeah just blending this all over the
skin patting it in so it has like a
decent coverage and then until concealer
I'm using the Too Faced Born This Way in
the shade light and just popping this
under the eyes and I do really love this
concealer but I feel like it can get a
bit drying on me and obviously I filmed
this back in November so recently I've
not been using it as much but it does
have a beautiful coverage sits really
nicely it doesn't crease and yeah like I
said it just covers really well so
popping that all over the skin and on at
the high points as well so on the
forehead and notes and also the chin and
then buffing it out with a Beauty
Blender because that's my favorite way
to do concealer is to set it and blend
it out with a damp sponge then I'm just
patting it in patting in sort of like
setting it sorry with some powder and
then also powdering at the rest of my
skin ready for any powder products that
we put on top and then pretty sure we go
back onto eyes yeah so I did my brows
off-camera just because you guys have
seen me do those a million times and
then I'm finishing off the eyes starting
with the lighter shade that we use
in the crease first which was burn
orange from the Anasazi a palette I'm
just blending this down at the lowest
because again we want to have a nice
gradient effect I'm using the Real
Techniques shading brush because I love
this for lower lash line like it's so
good at blending but also keeping it
where you want it to be and then I'm
just mixing in the two red shades for
the more bright red from the palate and
also the deeper red as well just to make
sure that everything balances and
matches the upper part of the eye and
then I'm highlighting the inner corner
and the brow bone with the same
highlighter that we're going to use on
the skin this is urban decay and
highlighter in the shade of sin and yeah
just popping that in those two places
and then just finishing off with some
red lip liner in the waterline which is
optional don't feel like you have to do
this I know some people don't like using
lip liners on their water line but I
know it works fine for me and obviously
I only ever use my products that aren't
myself so it's not particularly like on
how genic or anything that like that
then just finishing up with some lower
lashes and back on to skin and doing
bronze affairs so I'm just using the
makeup forever one and just applying
this to all the sort of areas that I
want to warm up the face a little bit so
the temples blending it back into the
hairline and also and the cheekbones and
the jawline as well which I didn't
actually think I included for this nope
and we're just putting this on all the
outer portions of the skin and then
using the highlighter as I said by Urban
Decay this is my favorite one to use
when I'm not as like faked and as they
usually are because it is very intense
it reminds me a lot of Mary Lou and I
love it for when I've got less of a turn
on and I'm a little bit fairer it really
does pop then we just need to do a lip
so I'm just using a stripped down by
Mark I feel like again I use this all
the time so I'm so sorry but I
absolutely love it just lining my lips
with that and sort of filling them in as
well I wanted to sort of include the
full clip of this and speed it up so you
can see how long it actually takes me to
line my lips because it's not a
five-minute job my lips are really
uneven as well like one side is way less
fuller than the other so I have to spend
extra time to make sure that both sides
are even and they look symmetrical I'm
using mith lipstick which is an oldie
but a goodie for me and just popping
this on the center it's very pale and I
did want a super nude lip because we've
got so much going on on the eyes that I
wanted the concentration to be there
then topping it off with some food and
SiC and I caught them in the name but
I'll link it down below again it's
really pale and really iridescent so it
looked beautiful as like a lip supper
and for the MAC lipstick in meth just
popping that on top and then finishing
up with some glass so I'm using Too
Faced lip injection because I want in my
lips to look nice and full and pouty and
this really does sort of it's very
tingly like it's one of the most tingly
lip plumping products I own it really
sort of burns your lips at first I'm not
gonna lie and but it does do a really
good job of just of enhancing them and
making them look a little bit fuller so
popping that all over and that is the
finished look so I really hope you guys
enjoyed this tutorial give it a massive
thumbs up if you did let me know in the
comments what you're doing for New
Year's because I would love to know
until then that is everything I love you
so much I love you to the moon and back
