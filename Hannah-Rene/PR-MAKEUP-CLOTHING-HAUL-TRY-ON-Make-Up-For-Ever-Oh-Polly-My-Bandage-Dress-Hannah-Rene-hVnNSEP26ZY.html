video that I've never actually felt
before and because you guys always love
seeing holes on my channel I feel like
holes do better than any other video I
upload and so I had we have an idea that
all the day because I have seen other
youtubers do this as well of doing a
hole and of all of my PR mails so all of
the stuff that I actually very kindly
get sent by brands like I said I've
never done this before and just because
I'm usually on boxes source job on
snapchat but this past week I've had
quite a lot of stuff come in the post so
actually guys on Twitter if this is
something that you'd want to see and a
lot of you said it yes so I'm going to
split it into two because there are
quite a lot of parcels that I've like
saved up to fell over there so this is
going to be part one and I'm going to do
my bandage dress Oh Polly and part of
make up forevers and then on my second
channel and I'm going to do the rest of
makeup forever because there's quite a
lot of stuff because I recently did a
master class with them and then I'm also
gonna do L'Oreal body shot and NYX and I
think that's everything I just don't
think I'm making this video am I trying
to brag about the stuff I'm innocent
because that is not the case whatsoever
and it literally is just because as I
said I know you guys love holes and I
thought I'd try something different
because they kind of get same old same
old run just do constant try on ones so
if you do like this video please let me
know by giving it a thumbs up and let me
know in the comments if you want me to
make this into like a little series and
but as I said please don't think I'm
trying to brag or be like oh my God look
at all this stuff back inside because
that is not the case whatsoever I'm so
grateful and to do YouTube as a job and
have you know work with so many amazing
brands and I know you guys know that but
I just wanted to say anyway so I hope
you do enjoy let me know if you do and I
will do some more and be I'm going to
start with clothes
so the first isotope is from my bandage
dress and if you guys know me you know
that I love my bandage rest is basically
an online store and they sell they sell
all like bandage clothes so like vanish
gets bandaged bodysuits just stuff
that's like really well fitted but just
really flattering on your figure
I love so many of the things they sell
actually buy a lot of it myself so they
very kind of got into contact with me
and sent four things over for me to like
try out I guess so I'm going to show you
them now though the first one is
actually a dress I don't think I even
have a dress from my Bunny's dress I
usually get like the skirts and your
body suits and stuff so this is what
this hot looks like it's going to be
hard to show but I'll make sure I try
all this
as I always do with them clothing whole
bits is a buddy contrast and honestly if
you've never got anything from the store
you won't know but like the quality of
these things are so good like the
material is so thick but stretchy at the
same time so it looks really flattering
on your figure and you can see like the
way they make it as well they make it so
it like hooks you in all the right
places like the way it shapes just like
a really nice sort of nudie beige and
it's not like a v-neck um neckline I
don't have anything like this from that
so I'm really interested to try it on
and but yeah it looks so cute it's kind
of like a midi dress I say and then it's
got a zip off the back so I'll leave
I'll leave a link to like everything I
mentioned down below if you want to
check out for yourself and then they
also sent over one of that bandage wrap
skirt this is is this called the bianca
style Bianca I think so maybe I'm not
entirely sure if you likely have one of
the style of like miniskirt other than
this but it's just like a really pale
and blue color which again I don't have
anything this color it's a really
interesting color and I probably pair
this with like a white or like a black
roller or something like that but the
thing I love about these skirts not only
are they like a gun really figure
hugging I like thick and whatnot and
they wrap over at the front and they
create a little V and it makes you like
look so good I don't know what it is
it's like my chair yeah I just love the
way that like um it's wrapped so it goes
liking like a cross you like to like a
diagonal shape it just hugs you figure
in a really lovely way and it makes that
you curves look really good and then
because the waist is obviously like a
little bit slimmer it really like sucks
you in at the waist as well so it just
really looks quite flattering I switch
between sizes in these just because they
can come up a little bit short on me and
I add again eight or ten this one's an 8
and I'm 5 foot 7 so I do sometimes have
issues with like my height and stuff
when I've got heels and whatnot and but
these always fit me really well and I
don't feel like uncomfortable in them as
in like they're too short or anything
like that so yes that is that one it's
like a really cool color and then these
next two things I probably like my
favorite show you're like my hair is
just gonna bug me like I'm so tempted to
tie it off so again it's one of the rap
skirts I'm pretty sure these are called
Bianca I mean I might be like so this
one again is just one of the rap skirts
and it's in like a sort of more be pink
color the cameras picking that up so
weird oh my god do you see that MBH it's
exactly this
but in a different color I tried this on
before and with what like the body see
but about show you and a little bit so
much I love this color but yeah I love
love love love this color I don't know I
just feel like it and sort of like suits
my skin tone even when I'm not got a lot
of fake tan on so yeah I absolutely love
it and again it's just the same style
and then we've also got a bodysuit in
the same color and I do have two body
suits from my managers they're both from
Holly boons collection if you don't
follow Holly oh if you're not subscribed
to it go subscribe she's absolutely
stunning and she's got three different
collections with my bunnies yes and
they're like my favorite things on the
website I love her style yeah I have two
of like the crossbody ones and they sort
of have like a little cutout here and
they make your boobs look up this one's
quite similar in the sense that it's got
a cutout but it's got like this strap
like this tab across which I'm seeing a
lot in like at the minute and different
tops and like um what are you suits in
different stores and then it's got a
choker as well so it has a zip but the
back so it's really really easy to get
on because you guys know I hate having
to pull like chokers over my head put
this zips all the way up and then yeah
it just goes into a body suit this isn't
an A and it doesn't suffocate my vagina
oh my god I can wear these and they're
comfortable all night long because they
do have like a good bit of stretch to
them even though I am taller the
absolutely fine so if you told like me
then don't worry and again it just sucks
you in a little bit at the waist so it
looks really really flattering and these
two together in love the own little bits
of clothing that I've got out from Oh
Polly and again you guys know I love a
Polly my favorite thing from them is the
jumpsuits that light and multi-way
jumpsuits I have them in about like four
different colors I've got the kaki the
black the maroon and then they very
kindly sent me another one because I
wanted like the extra one to complete
them all yeah if you follow me on
instagram you will know I wear those so
much there's so many photos of me in
them because they're so comfy nice out
but they look really really good
absolutely love them and know like a
really good price yet the first thing
and they very kindly sent over was one
of these that same multi way budget
jumpsuit sorry Jesse body sees fireman
jumpsuit so this is what they look like
if you've never seen what they look like
on and the reason that I love them is
because obviously like it's a multi way
so you can adjust house height the upper
part is so I like to do these quite
tight
it makes my boobs look good and then it
just has a really thick waistband so
again it sucks you at the waist a bit
and then it's just got em leg ins this
is actually a crop twine I do have one
other cropped one which is the maroon
one and I absolutely love it it fits
really lovely so yeah again I will link
all the stuff from here down below and I
also do have a video where I did it get
ready with me and I filmed how I hide
these because I do get quite a lot of
questions on that because people always
see that I tied them in a certain way to
like make it look as flattering as
possible or whatever so I'll link that
video down below if you want to see that
as well then we've also got a camo
jacket because I'm obsessed with ikono
jackets for wintertime like water winter
especially for layering
I just got a crotch one from boohoo not
so long ago but I saw this one on the
website and it's like a full length and
it's oversized so I thought I'd be
perfect like put over like a black
hoodie or something so I got it in a
medium just because I did want it to be
like a little bit more oversized as I
said and I'm pretty sure it was only
about 25 pounds I'm on the website so
it's super affordable for what it is and
it's just like a really sort of darkish
music like camo color I guess we all
know what camel looks like come on hunts
got two pockets here and then it's just
got like gold zip detail in and just
like a little gold button down here and
then also some tassels so I'm going to
see what it's like layered with like a
black hoodie because I feel like that
could look really cool for like casual
daytime outfit you know and then this
next thing I have already bought these
oh it smells like fresh clothes I've
already bought two of these sets myself
in different colors I have them in nude
and black and it's basically a cropped
legging like so and then and it's just
like quite high waisted and it's got
really like thick waistband and it's
really thick material it's double
layered so it's comfy it's thick it's
not see-through it keeps you warm some
of my favorite leggings as you can see
they are just leggings I don't even know
if I said that and but they do these you
can either get them cropped or
full-length and then they do and either
these little crop tops to go with them
which I'll show you now or they do like
high neck I think the high neck or the
round neck and the long sleeve so this
is in the taupe color I think it's like
a sort of purpley
gray this is what the little top looks
like so as you can see it's just like a
match in two piece and I got this one in
a 10 because if I'm going to be honest
with my other two I got them in an 8 and
they fit me perfectly when I first got
them but then I feel like after they
went in the wash they sort of shrunk a
little bit I don't know what it was and
so I've got them in a 10 just so that
they fit me a little bit better and yeah
it's just like a scoop neck so it just
goes all the way down you can wear these
without a bra and because they're so
thick like again the double layered
they're not like your nipples don't show
through or anything like that and
they're really really comfy I can't
recommend them enough thank you - Oh
Polly and also to my bandage dress for
sending those things over I'll make sure
that I try them on and that I was
supposed to as on Instagram so that you
can see them like how I style them also
going to get a football because I can't
can't deal with myself right that's good
enough to do boys and girls so makeup
brother I did a master class with them I
don't know how to slap myself in a
master class to them because they've
just opened at a counter in Manchester
and it's deafening Market Street if
you've not been it's so pretty it's such
like a beautiful makeup concert and the
staff there are incredible so definitely
make a trip and especially if you like
me don't like ordering stop online we
finally have a concert mutters so it
makes me so happy so as you guys know I
am from Manchester and I am repping
Manchester in the beauty YouTube
community so they very kindly invited me
down and to do a master class for five
of you guys we had so much fun and then
I also did a little alone and in a
blogger party as well it was just like
the most fun I had such a good time and
but for that reason they did send over a
lot of store basically I got crap Pathan
approach can I just say as well makeup
brother
I have loved since day one and the fact
that like I am lucky enough to be able
to work with them now speechless I don't
even not say like having this YouTube
channel tunnel in general and being able
to film videos like this where people
have like runs of like sent me stuff I'm
like how did I get here and then I
remember it's you guys that get me here
and without getting really cheesy like
I'm honestly so grateful and speechless
honestly I just I don't know I don't
know I just oh it's crazy I'm gonna try
and work through it quickly as possible
Remz like a lot of straw so the first
thing is to ultra-hd six one of them is
in my actual like shade that I used my
whole face which I've gone today and
then one is in a darker shade and that
she is why four four five so let's just
switch the bathroom light on really
anyway one of them is in a darker shade
because I actually cream consoled with
it and I loved the finish of it and like
the way it looked I don't usually like
cream contour and but because I love the
formula if this foundation so much you
guys know it's like my favorite one of
all time and it looked so pretty and so
a brush so those are those two shades
and you will see them in a video very
very soon I went to say shortly and then
I said soon and now it's tuned okay
we've also got the water blend and
foundation which is like a face and body
foundation it's quite share it's my
first time using it at the master class
when I did use it and and me and Julian
when we were like working out what look
we were going to do he basically uses as
like a base on me on top of a primer and
before but I'll show you she stick and
it just really helped to like sort of
create like a nice black canvas not too
much like it was really lightweight and
he was saying this was is it waterproof
yeah it's waterproof and it's made with
80 percent water but it's waterproof so
the really nice thing about it is that
you can use it on your body and it
doesn't transfer onto clothes so stay if
you have accidentally done a foundation
that's too dark on your face you can pop
like this on on you neck on your body
and you won't get it on any clothes like
even if you wear a white top because we
all know we'd have I oh yeah this and
I've really loved it it's very sheer it
reminds me a lot of muck face and body
when I used to work at Mac and
foundations like that I really lovely
fur people would like mature skin as
well if you want something quite natural
or if you've got really young skin and
you don't want to wear a lot of makeup
this is great and it lasts all day
because it is it is waterproof we've got
a mist unfix which is just a setting
spray and I can't really like make a
judgement on this yet because I'm not
use it properly but effectively it's a
setting spray so you can either use it
like before you make up as like a sort
of primer if you want or it's mostly for
like afterwards to set your makeup in
place and make it last all day I did
like you want to used it's very
refreshing very cooling on the skin but
obviously like I'm not tried it properly
I usually
use one by Edna K so I need to give it a
proper girl before I tell you my
thoughts we've got two of the aqua brow
kits one is in the shade 15 and the
other is in the shade 25 these are
really cute because they come in a
little box but then they have a case so
you get like it's like an actual kit you
get the product and a little brush and a
little like brow comb if you like it's
like a mascara wands so the brush that
comes with it is just an angled brush I
don't know if you can see yeah you can
kind of see it's quite dense like if I'm
going to be honest I found it a little
bit difficult to work with like if you
like a structured brow you won't like
this brush and but because I've had my
brows micro bladed now I found it worked
quite well on me and because I do go for
a little bit more of a natural look now
don't know if natural is the right word
and yet this is what the actual product
looks like so it's kind of like a poem
aids flash gel and again it's waterproof
so lasts all day long the actual formula
it's really lovely you need the tiniest
bit so this little tube even though it's
tiny do not be deceived the best things
come in small packages guys big is not
always better
as Michelle Keegan's has on the Revlon
advert okay we've got a pro light fusion
if you watch my favorites video like my
recent court of sessions I absolutely
love this and I might give this one away
scene as soon as I've already actually
got one I might give this one away it's
one of the most beautiful highlighters
I've ever used in my life it's very it
can be very natural but very like
intense at the same time so what do you
do one layer it's very like it's like a
soft glow hip glow from within if you
like and it just melts into the skin I
feel like anyone would like this I know
some things like mary lou manizer I like
because I like an intense highlighter
but this I feel like you can achieve
whatever sort of intensity you one and
they do this one which is 0-2 and it's
like a really nice deep goals which is
actually what I've done today and all
they do 0-1 which is a pinke pale shade
can't recommend this enough it's
probably one of my favourite products
will make it forever now along with the
foundation we've got a pro bronze fusion
which I had purchased these myself in
the past and I absolutely love them and
this one is in the shade zero to zero I
believe I have one other which is a
little bit darker this one's more like a
cool tone
works nice it's like a contour shade as
well and that it's like the color a bit
here the thing that I really like about
these is that they're very buildable on
the skin so again you can have like a
really natural look that's lit just like
a little bit of like definition or you
can really go in and like create
something quite structured on like your
cheekbones and your temples and whatnot
look these honestly like makeup rubber
as incense one of my favorite companies
that products just set beautifully on my
skin anyway abnormal strike independence
wondering and and I absolutely love them
so we've got two of the step one prime
is the first one is and the hydrating
primer which I love this when I used it
in store I've used the like the
smoothing one which the other one like
once before and but this one because as
I said I've got a normal to dry skin
this is what me and Julian use I
absolutely loved the way it like felt on
my skin and the way the foundation sat
on top and use this one all over my face
and then I'd just use the smoothing one
which is like it's good for areas where
there's like large pores or anything
that you want to like smooth out and
sweats called the smoothing primer I
just use this one like on my cheek areas
here and like my t-zone and stuff
because that's why I tend to get like
larger pores that I want to fill in a
little bit but the combo of these two
love love love love love oh shit one of
these is smushed
well we've got three eyeshadows one of
them has smashed so the first one is
m600 we basically created a shadow like
an eye look with three shadows so this
one here was one of my favorites it's
like a really nice like matte Brown I'm
going to try just like a really nice
chocolatey Brown as you can see it's
kind of got like more B tones to it as
well it's absolutely stunning and makeup
for ever shadows again some of my
favourites work with the pigmentation is
insane and I really like the fact that
they blend really easily like it doesn't
matter how much you put on well
obviously I can you go overboard then
it's going to be crazy but they're just
a dream to blend out like that's so
silky then we have a slightly dark one
which we use in the outer V and this one
is m6
1/8 and I can't open it yeah this is
just like a deeper more like charcoal
greyish
gray brown and which just looks like so
again I frighten these got new finger I
need to get new finger what literally
the pigmentation is just like something
else it's ridiculous like obviously
makeup Forever's quite a pricey brand
but believe me when I say it they're
worth the money like look at that what
am I doing with my boys
I do not know then this last one is my
favorite of the three because it's so
intensely pigmented for like a shimmery
eyeshadow I was obsessed so this is the
shade d7 one two this is one of the
diamond eye shadows so they have like
pressed diamonds and powder like forms
of the eyeshadows if you like did that
even make sense
I don't think so it's basically just
very shimmery and very sparkly it's just
like a really nice sort of warm
champagne color and this was I put this
on the ledge obviously and oh my gosh
you can already see it and I've not even
swatch it yeah it's blinding wow wow wow
yes please put that all over my face and
my body when I die thank you so much
now I've got a diamond powder in the
shade number two which again I actually
already have one of these I use it
mostly as a highlighter so I did have it
on today I mean my makeup I don't know
it's kind of stuff i layer this on top
of the highlighter the gold one I
mentioned before the pro-life fusion and
I know what you thinking Hannah it's a
glitter are you crazy
yes even though it's a glitter it's very
like finely milled in my opinion so the
actual glitter itself is not chunky at
all like the fact that I can put this on
the tops of my cheekbones and it looks
good I don't have any of the glitters
well unless I want to do something
that's like festival inspired or like
super dramatic I wouldn't do that with
any other glitter and what the diamond
powder is really are like so beautiful
again and just like melts into the skin
and just sit really pretty like come on
look at that glow
I've had this make one all day I'm
really sorry if it look like shit and
then we've also got one of the star
powders which I hadn't used these before
and the difference between star powder
and diamond powder is that diamond is a
glitter so even though I just said it's
quite fine it is like a glitter still so
it just have the chunks whereas star
powder is more like your and iridescent
powder and it's a lot more like fine
it's just like a loose powder it's like
a white gold one oh my gosh it's like a
white powder but it's got like gold
reflex
if you're going to be able to see that
that is an awkward place to swatch Wow
Hannah what is Charlie doing I really
don't know it's like a really nice white
gold Sheen so I literally layered for
the master class the highlighter this
and then the diamond powder and we were
all just like my balloon we've got one
of the HD blushes this is a cream blush
and it's in the shade is what it looks
like it's such a beautiful like
universal shade because it's sort of
like a like a peachy orange and I feel
like blushes like this really flatter a
lot of skin tones compared to something
that's quite pink and and you know I was
really impressed with this because they
don't have like that is the color of it
that they don't have the powder blushes
in the makeup and the makeup sorry the
Manchester concert the minute and so we
had to use a cream blush but I'd already
set my face with powder so I was a bit
like huh because you're not really
supposed to use a cream after a powder
but it blended like a dream as you can
get is the color of it there I feel like
it's just something that will go with
every single makeup look I'm really good
for all year round just because it is
quite neutral it's just like a sort of
peachy and like coral so yeah this is
like my favorite sort of color of blush
anything that's like peach coral orange
I prefer those two pink especially on
myself okay and then we have aqua seal
which Gillian was educating younger
stuff because it's basically like a
multi-purpose product it's like one of
those products that everyone needs that
it's a bit random but it'll do you so
many favors so it's labeled as a
waterproof liquid converter so you can
basically put it in like you can mostly
use it for a ton of different stuff and
it makes things waterproof so you were
saying that you can mix this in with you
foundation like you can add a couple of
drops like a liquid foundation and then
apply it and it will make your
foundation waterproof hence again it
will last all day and like sale better
it won't transfer any clothes as much
and I actually use this as an eyeshadow
base and I just put a drop on my hand
and like the back of my hand and then I
sort of worked it with my fingers and it
gets a little bit tacky and then I press
it on top and the shadows it worked so
well as a base lightly just really sort
of like structure weight on top like not
in a sense that they complained but they
were really pigmented like on top of it
and then another one I'm pretty sure you
were saying if you have a like say
you've got lots of different colors
shadows and you want to use them as
liquid liners you can like scrape a
little bit of the eyeshadow out and then
pop it on like a palette or some tissue
and then if you add a drop of this it
makes it a waterproof liner which I
thought was so cool as well because you
just want to have multiple apply now or
like different colored line is
especially like it seems you buying an
extra product so it's just a really
handy thing to have we've got a lipstick
this is one of the artists Rouge and
these are the new lipsticks they've got
them in two different finishes a satin
and a map honestly love them I've got
one already it's like a really pale and
nude but the one we used was a little
bit darker and a bit more of like a sort
of warm
Toby color it's quite similar to what
I've gotten today actually which is
Kylie kind ek if you want to know how
the pigmentation like guys it's not a
joke it's really not a joke they're not
playing they're not joke this is in the
shade C 107 and it's one of the satin
ones so it's not one of the matte ones
and but the matte ones aren't drying at
all so I definitely recommend trying
them and I've won one of these before
all day which was the more pale one and
it lasted really well very comfortable
to wear very moisturizing I was obsessed
also gods what else have we got
oh the concealer I forgot to mention
this okay so I did actually buy this
myself not so long ago but I got a shade
that was like way too light and this is
the new oil change D concealer I love
the format of this it's really full
coverage but it doesn't crease because I
was using it under my eyes even though
it was too pale I was just mixing it
with other things and I had to show you
why one 1:9 I think it was it's like the
palest one and what for the Masterclass
I used white 2/3 and I loved it it works
so well with the ultra HD SiC and
obviously that's my favorite foundation
so no have the concealer too much next
thing is a gloss which we use this is
like a full face of makeup this is why
there's lights on these products because
it's everything we use on my face but
can we just look at this graph a minute
like I don't know if you're gonna be
able to see the glitter in this focus
look at the glitter in that oh my
goodness and I put this on my lips I
know one of the things I really like is
the applicator so personally for lip
glosses I prefer like a doe foot
applicator where it's quite far I don't
really like brushes because they give
you like strokes on your lips and
the applicator for this is like a dream
honestly like it just gets the job done
so quickly and it blends it all really
evenly so you can kind of see it that
it's quite share in terms of the actual
color but that's what I like when I'm
like looking for a glass I know some
people like in quite pigmented but I
honestly just like them to make my lips
look glossy because I feel like the
lipstick underneath gives you the
pigment and and the glitter and not like
when it reflects on the light it's so
stunning i absolutely love it i don't
think i said what shade this was it's
the shade 300 p i'll have everything
listed down below because let's be
honest no one's gonna remember this the
last thing is a bunch of brushes so
we've got the one five six which looks
like so can I just say I'd never tried
makeup for ever brushes before and I
just like how to use into the class I
was blown away I was like oh my gosh
these shit on every single brush I've
ever owned so this one is quite
interesting to me because I wouldn't
usually like the sort of pedal brush a
foundation but the quality of it and the
way it blends it I was my blur Mike
honestly it blended it so beautifully it
looked at brushed this guy I've decided
is my favorite brush of the law
this one is one Umbra since this is a
one for four and the reason is is
because it has so many purposes that you
can do so many different things with it
so again it's just like a sort of paddle
brush it's like a flap um yeah a flat
brush as you can see we use this to
concealer we use this to pack on color
on the lid with the shadow and I use
this as well as I use for primer or like
highlighting in certain areas and it's
just a really good precision brush but
it's not like so small that it takes you
forever to do stuff for concealer it was
my favorite I think and then also
packing the color on the lid it was
insane next is a angled liner brush and
again I feel like this is going to
replace every like eyeliner brush I've
ever used this is a two sips too and the
reason I like this so much is because
look at the size of it is massive
compared to my and other angled liner
brushes anyway it got the job done so
quickly honestly doing a twink liner in
front of a bunch of people not my most
fun experience my hand was literally
shaking but this made it so easy because
you like to just take a little bit of
gel and then you
was there like you let's just stamp it
and it's big enough so like do a wing
that's long enough and then you
literally jog it back took me like two
minutes taught to do both sides it was
an absolute dream the last one is quite
similar to the first one this is a 106
oh my gosh I wish you could feel this is
so soft and I use this to apply could
not conceal a house what so you can see
that use a surprise what it uses to
apply primer and which I usually use my
fingers for but this was really really
lovely because it just blended it so
nicely and it feels amazing on your skin
because it's so soft again you could use
this for foundation and I also use this
to blend out my I've gone it shows I use
it to blend out my cream bronzer like
the darker HD stick love love-love-love
yeah I think I'm going to do everything
else in the older whole so I really hope
