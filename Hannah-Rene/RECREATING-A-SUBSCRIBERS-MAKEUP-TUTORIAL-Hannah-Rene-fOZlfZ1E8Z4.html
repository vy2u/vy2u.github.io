so excited about like so excited about
because for the first time in what feels
like my whole YouTube life I'm pretty
sure I finally come up with something
that is like my own idea like I searched
it on YouTube and stuff I basically had
this idea and I searched it on YouTube
and things and I can't find anyone else
who's done it do correct me if I'm wrong
and someone has done XIV ously I want to
give someone credit but I'm pretty sure
no one ever has and I'm so excited about
it because I love the idea so what I'm
going to be doing in today's video is
I'm basically gonna be recreate in one
of your videos so I asked on Twitter
because I know a lot of you are like
Beauty youtubers or fashion youtubers or
you do similar videos to myself
obviously the beauty community on
YouTube is humongous and I know a lot of
you are part of it so I basically asked
for like any of you who wanted to to
basically send me a link to your
favorite tutorial on your channel which
was so much fun I let you have so much
fun looking at them and like going
through their - I just thought this
would be so much fun first of all just
to sit down and recreate one of your
looks because as I said so many of you
were like super talented and stunning
and I just thought it'd be really fun to
sit down and basically follow your
tutorial and show it to all of you guys
that watch my videos I guess I just
thought it'd be a really fun way as well
as like basically sharing all the
people's channels within like our
community if that makes sense because
when I was doing my ship down video the
other day a lot of you were like
tweeting about how to kind of grow your
channel and things like that as I seen
like now the beauty community is so big
it's kind of hard to like break through
if that makes sense as I said so many of
you have super talented and do
incredible content and things I kind of
just want to like I don't know I might
make it into a series where I do it like
a couple or like maybe one every other
week or something and basically just
like share someone's channel and
someone's work so that you guys can find
new people to watch you know I just
thought if you're really fun so I hope
you like the idea of this video let me
know if you want me to do more of these
videos obviously I picked one and for
this video but let me know if you want
me to do more and feel free to link your
tutorials and stuff in the description
in the description bar in the comment
section so that I can have a lobby girl
that I've chosen for today's video is
called cats I'm pretty sure his second
name is pronounced Perez so it's cat
breast I'm the worst at pronouncing name
so I'm sorry if that's wrong that is
someone that I see literally tweeted me
all the time as well like I love her so
much she's such a lovely
and when I saw this video like she
tweeted me her sort of like everyday
tutorial it was stunning like so
gorgeous literally gone out and bought
every single product that she apart from
one product because it was out of stock
in both shops that I went to it's so
annoying and it's actually a product
that I used to own as well which is why
it's even more annoying but I went and
got all the products that she used and
things like that and I'm basically gonna
sit down and recreate the look as she
did in her video like I said her actual
juice Oriole will be in the description
bar please go and check it out like
while she watching this or after you
watching this or whatever because she is
stunning yeah I'm just gonna get started
again lots of new products lots of stuff
that I've never tried before so again I
thought be really fun to basically try
some of your recommendations and things
that you use and things like that
so the thing that I really loved about
cats tutorial before I actually got into
the makeup and it was kind of like an
everyday makeup routine and it seemed
like when I was watching the video it
seemed like the sort of thing that was
really quick for her to do but it looked
it's like still really glum and like put
together it was honestly my kind of look
because it was just like super easy
super like nude and neutral like a new
dish lip nude eye stuff like that just
really elegant and simple but really
kind of glam at the same time because
she did use lashes and things like that
like she had the most beautiful skin she
literally only used concealer and then
powder products no foundation or
anything like that so I'm hoping that
I'm gonna pull it off because I like I'm
not used to wearing just concealer and
things like that but I'm gonna give it a
go and hopefully it will look as good on
me as it did on her first thing that cut
used in her tutorial was the benefit
Porefessional primer which I have to say
I have never completely fallen in love
with because I should know what it is I
just feel like there's other primers
that I love more and stuff like that
book she kind of applied it all over her
skin and like in a t-zone and stuff and
because she didn't use foundation like
the idea of it is a lot more appealing
for me I guess because I suppose it like
minimizes pores and stuff but it doesn't
really matter about anything else
because you're not putting a full base
on top if you know I mean so I'm gonna
give this a go today it's just kind of -
like minimize pores and stuff like that
it's a really popular product yeah I
don't usually use it under foundation
just because I like obviously my skin's
like normal to dry so I prefer to use
something that's like more hydrating and
like
all the waiters just makes my skin more
luminous and stuff but the idea of using
this on the skin alone and then just
concealer I really like right I'm just
gonna pop some out how cute is this
little mini by the way you can get this
in like a mini I think it was about ten
pounds so that is what the product looks
like I'm pretty sure she just applied
this like in a t-zone so it's one of
those products where it's like because
I'm not used it before I don't really
know how much to use the whole
minimizing primers feel so interesting
to me cuz they're like so soft they met
you skin feels so soft to the touch
their smells really good I never noticed
that before okay so that is John also
don't my man catch I've gone to the
hobby of like wearing my hair like this
at the minute because hello hello yeah
okay so the next thing that she did as I
said there was no foundation or anything
it was just like a really simple base
situation I guess and she went in with
the Born This Way concealer which is one
of my favourite concealers ever app so
they love this stuff really like
hydrating and stuff I feel like when to
the eyes it's such a good concealer for
under eyes and she used the shade I
think it was medium light or like medium
honey she's like a slightly darker
shades what I'm gonna use just because
she was a tiny bit like deeper and
complexion to what I am I'm gonna use
the shade light and she basically just
applied it onto the eyes and a little
bit in the t-zone so like forehead nose
and chin and then blend it out with a
sponge so that's exactly what I'm gonna
do
I'll add in a tiny tiny bit of medium
but I don't want too much cuz it's quite
a bit darker medium I don't know if you
can tell oh my god I'm just like piling
concealer on now and then she does do
eyeshadow and stuff so I'm just running
it onto the eyes as a primer so that
we've got like a base for shadow
blending it down a little bit more than
I usually would just because obviously
this is like our only proper like base
product okay and the powder that she
uses to set that in place is the Rimmel
stay matte so that's what I'm gonna use
as well mine is in the shade of
transparent to finish
the skin she next went in with the
colour-pop super shock cheek product in
the shade west okay so I have actually
never tried anything from colour-pop
before which I know I probably should
have because everyone raves about them
and a super affordable and stuff so
obviously I ordered this for this video
oh and oh my god when I swatch this with
my finger I was mind blown it is so soft
I can't even like like it is so I wish
you could feel it if anyone's got one of
these obviously cut the hose but if
anyone else has got one of these let me
know if you know what I mean like it is
so soft and it just swatches beautifully
like it kind of feels like a cream to
powder kind of formula because when you
swatch it it feels wet and creamy and
then once you swatch it it kind of feels
like it dries to a powder so not
actually use this on the skin yet so I'm
really excited to see what oh oh my gosh
it's just like I don't even explain the
texture of it it's just so soft and
creamy so that is what that looks like
absolutely love it
tiny just melts into the skin it looks
like a really natural product I probably
applied too much my nose but it's too
much too much next thing that she goes
in with is a bronzer obviously just like
finish off the skin and stuff so the
bronzer that cat uses is the hoola
bronzer by benefit absolutely love this
product one of my favorites ever just
gonna use my Sigma angled contour brush
I'm just gonna apply that to my cheek
ease and there's one or two products
that cat did in a show in the video but
she did put in the description bar so
I'm gonna pop those on anyway because
I'm assuming that she used them but
didn't include the clip so the first one
is the sleek um highlighting palette in
the style or shade should I say and
Cleopatra's at kiss so I'm gonna use I'm
guessing shoes is to like top off the
highlight so I'm just gonna apply a
little bit to my cheeks hopefully it
won't be like too dark for my skin no
it should be okay absolutely love sleek
highlighting kits think they're so
pretty
so good for the price as well okay and
then the next thing that she does is do
her brows and honestly her brows are so
fluffy and thick and well shaped like I
was so telling so when I watch the video
so I'm gonna use obviously the product
that she used which was the Anastasi of
beverly hills dipbrow and pretty sure
she used the shade chocolate
correct me if I'm wrong but I'm gonna
use the shade of dark brown it's a tiny
tiny bit lighter just because um I don't
know see on the one that compared right
now so oh I'm just gonna go in with my
little Mac two whites it's a two six six
oh my gosh it's like a brand new part
like literally
brand new okay so brows are now gone the
next thing that cut does in the video is
eyes so the palette that shoes it's the
Too Faced sweet peach palette absolutely
love at this palette and obviously it
smells at delicious and it's not super
clear in the video which shadows that
she uses but the whole eye look looks
quite warm and like neutral and things
excuse me and things like that so I must
see I'm pretty sure she uses a mix of
like puree and summer young I'm guessing
so I'm basically gonna mix these two
together and pop those in the crease
accidently applied waiting watching this
eye and now it just won't lend out do
you mind
okay and then she also went in with a
blush which is by sleek and it's in the
shade of pomegranate eye funnily enough
I used to actually own that blush and I
got rid of it because it's quite a dark
berry color and but she uses it and uses
it as an eye shadow in the video which
is a really clever idea like it's such a
stunning color as it is I went into a
boots and Superdrug to try and
repurchase it and both of them we're out
of stock of it so I'm just gonna use a
little bit of fever by Mac because it's
kind of like a similar color so I'm just
gonna use a touch of that to sort of
compensate for not having pomegranate
fault mascara cut used the Maybelline at
lush sunset the lash sensational mascara
by Maybelline which everyone always Rose
about this but it's just one of those
products that I've never tried so that
is what I'm going to be using
or mascara and then she did apply it
lashes these are the Becca lashes in the
style doesn't have the style in on the
box what style with these I think they
were Arabella yeah I'm pretty sure these
were in the style Arabella I purchased
them on the backer lashes website I
can't remember I think they're about six
pounds seven pounds really inexpensive
anyway they're just like a really pretty
kind of full all the way round kind of
lash as you can see so I'm basically
going to go ahead and do mascara and
lashes off-camera and then I will be
back with you in a minute to basically
do the lip and finish off okay so those
are the eyes done these lashes are
actually really easy to put on the lash
bomb was nice and thin which just made
them really easy to pop right on you
feel very comfortable
they're very nice I like flow-through
they're not too intense which makes them
good for like an everyday look so that
is the isodyne
I did put a little bit of eye shadow and
like mascara on the lower lashes as well
just because it's hot by the looks of it
that's what she did in the video
so all we have left to do is lips and at
the lip product that cat used was velvet
teddy by Mark which is a hundred percent
an oldie but a goodie it just reminds me
of when I used to work at Marc and how
many we used to sell like is such a
beautiful and popular lip product so I'm
gonna try and like line my lips and
stuff with this and not use a liner
because cut didn't so I want to be true
that cat okay so this is the finished
look I absolutely love it really love it
I feel like the skin still looks nice
and like chewy and flawless and stuff
even though we only use like pretty much
one cream base product and then just
like a couple of part of products I love
how simple the eyes are but like I said
with the lashes it just makes it a
little bit more glam and put together
love the lip color palettes Hedy like I
said oldie but a goodie and I love the
brows like again a Nastasia brow brow is
brow pomade oldie but a goodie so yeah
this is Kats makeup look on my face
pretty much so let me know what you
