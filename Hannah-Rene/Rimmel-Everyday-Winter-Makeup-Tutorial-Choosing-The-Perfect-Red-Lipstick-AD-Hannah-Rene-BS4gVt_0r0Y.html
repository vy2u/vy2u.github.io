kind of interesting video I was about to
say today's video is a tutorial on this
makeup which it is but it's also like a
swatch video combining - I've actually
teamed up with Rimmel again for this
video today I did a video with them and
not so long ago so I'll link it down
below if you've not already seen it but
they've basically sent me another one of
their box of goodies so the theme of the
last box was sort of like I'm glossy
lips and minimal eyes it was like a
really high gloss trend this time we've
got a box guys named red alert the
actual lid for the box is so cute it
looks like this
so yeah this box is it named red alert
and they basically sent me please don't
drop it basically send me a bunch of red
products so we've got red nail varnishes
which as you can see have pop one on
here and we've also got a bunch on ready
lip liners and then also a ton of red
lipsticks which are all over my arm I've
got a ton of red lipsticks and then also
some sort of chubby sticks and some lip
glosses as well it's basically a box
themed around red which if you guys know
me it's my favorite color so rather than
just doing a standard tutorial I'm also
going to be showing you how I swatch and
makeup products in particular lipsticks
which is why I've got like a full
rainbow of write everything they want to
show you guys how I swatch lipsticks in
order to choose one that best matches my
skin tone and my complexion and also
just to help me decide which one is
going to create the look that I'm going
for
so this is the look that I came up with
and obviously this is the red that I've
chosen right here which you're going to
know which one it is it later on in the
video and then I chose a red nail
varnish that sort of matches it I want a
bit quite deep and like autumn and
winter appropriate without further ado
I'm going to stop Rumble in and get on
with the video so you want to see how i
got this makeup look and how i swatch
lipsticks then it just keep watching ok
so I've already got my foundation
concealer powder and eyebrows on my
eyebrows on I feel like you've seen me
do that a million times on this tutorial
is more so about the eyes I'm mostly the
lips really and but you want to know
what products I use that I'll link them
all down below anyway so yeah I'm not
gonna run to a highlighter I'll still do
that on camera
so yeah I'm literally just gonna put a
brown through the crease any Brown will
do but I am going to use this is the K M
okay I'm gonna use this for the piece as
well I'm just gonna use this really
really lightly and the crease just to
give like a little bit of definition and
then we're gonna do a wing I'm not doing
a Genoa always just put something in the
crease anyway just because it helps to
like you give your eyes a little bit of
definition and just helps like contour a
little bit so that is what we're gonna
do yeah I'm actually just taking the
tiniest bit and then I'm gonna start
like in the center this is quite
pigmented like this palette as you can
see so like a little bit goes a long way
you can see it like literally the
difference that it makes so just having
a tiny little bit of shadow in the
crease like it makes so much difference
even if it's just one shade so for
eyeliner this is my favourite liquid
liner of all time you guys know that I
love this it's the Rimmel exaggerate
eyeliner this is the waterproof one they
do it in an on one as well the reason
this is like my favorite one is because
it's so black like I have never found a
liquid liner or even a gel liner as
black as this one like it's literally
pitch black like you're gonna see now
like look how black it is it's literally
not even a joke
oh there's nothing that puts me on edge
more than a wing liner
okay so mascara I'm gonna use the volume
colorist this is my favorite one from
Rimmel because it's a good mascara it's
like really volumizing and lengthening
and whatnot but it also has a ten in it
so over time actually tense your natural
lashes which means they look black or
without any makeup on as well which is
obviously really handy for when you've
not got any makeup on
talking a new mascara is not and then
I'm just gonna put a little bit of the
bronzer underneath my eyes as well just
so that it sort of ties in together and
then I'm gonna finish off with a little
bit of mascara on the lower lashes as
well and I like putting the car on the
lower lashes because it really opens up
my eyes but you just do what you feel
Concord okay so to finish off the skin
I'm gonna use the same bronzer that's in
here this is actually the darkest of the
Cape palettes it's like a little bit too
dark for me at the minute but I'm just
gonna use like a really light hand with
it and so yeah this one that we just use
on the eyes is what I'm gonna use to do
my face as well okay and then I'm going
to skip the blush for this particular
look because I just want my keynotes to
the focus to be on the lips so I'm just
gonna go in with the highlighter at the
top which is literally it's such a good
highlights it from the drugstore I
absolutely love it so I'm just going to
pop that on the tops of the cheekbones
you know the treadlow let's still you
forget shoulders again I forgot this is
just gonna become a tradition in
tutorials to do shoulders and collarbone
and all the whole chest so now we're
onto lips I feel that was really quick
but this is such a quick tutorial so
we've got quite a lot of Reds to choose
from because they've spent quite a few
over so I'm basically gonna like swatch
them all and we're gonna choose which
it's gonna look bad though so these are
all of the ones we've got we've got
three of the moisture new ones which are
the ones here and five Kate ones we've
got two of like the chubby stick sort of
pencil lip products at the back these
are the only one I believe yeah the only
one lip sticks and then we've also got
two more Kate ones here so I'm gonna
swatch them all on my arms so you guys
can see how
Swach lipsticks as well okay so I'm
literally gonna swatch each lipstick on
my arm and I thought I'd show you how I
do this because I feel like swatching is
something that everyone loves to do what
people don't really know like where to
swatch or like how to I guess to make it
look nice and neat so I do it on my arm
if I'm gonna do a lot of products just
so that there's lots of room and as you
can see I just take the lipstick
straight from the bullet and then the
very like tip of the bullet I guess what
you would apply on Zee lips I just apply
that to my arm and then just do a stroke
downwards and light sort of drop off if
you know what I mean so it just sort of
falls off and creates like a really nice
line it just helps like keep a good
shape I guess and and if you want to
help if you want help like choosing one
for your skintone
I feel like with fair skin tones
obviously lipsticks that are brighter
are gonna look more intense so you might
want to go with more muted red if you
don't want it to like overpower the
whole make up deeper skin tones can
usually handle and like bright intense
colors a lot more so like orange based
Reds but it's completely up to you what
you are it's honestly just personal
preference anyone can pull any lipstick
off and by all means so personally I
like to go with a deeper one just
because even though I've got fake tan on
the minute I do like the way it looks to
me a little bit more plus I like to use
a cool toned red a lot of the time just
because it does actually helps make your
teeth look a lot whiter compared
something that's a bit warmer yeah so I
feel like for people like myself who
have a bit of a fairer skin and blue
toned lipsticks are always a really safe
bet you're always gonna know they look
good whereas orange tones can maybe
clash a little bit and depending what I
make up you've got on as well you can
still completely like why don't know if
that's what you're comfortable with and
then in terms of darker skin tones a
brighter sort of like orange base red is
gonna pop more and it's gonna look a
little bit more noticeable I guess and a
deeper more like blue tone red will be a
little bit more subtle that's just the
way I see it that's just my opinion and
but yeah anyone can wear whatever they
want to wear and there's a good chance
they will pull it off so you do you and
you wear whatever you wanna wear and I'm
sure it will look amazing
so some of them do actually look quite
um similar this one's a little bit more
pinky and then all these in the center
is sort of like warmish orangey red
especially that one that one's a little
bit cooler and this one for me though
screams it with the most the one that's
like the dark is just because I feel
like it's the most sort of autumn winter
so that one was when is the shade 107 by
capes that's the one that I'm gonna use
just because cool-toned
Reds help to make you see look a lot
whiter as well so I feel like it's just
gonna flatter me more in general this is
one of the exaggerated liners in the
shade zero to four which 24 is actually
my lucky number and it's in the shade
red diva so that's the one I'm gonna use
to line my lips and then I'm gonna fill
them in with the Cape lipstick I'm just
gonna top it off with one of the provoke
a lips so this one's like a bit of a
berry tone so I'm not going to use that
one this one yes this one's in the shade
5-0 play with fire and it looks like
more of a red tone so I'm gonna pop that
on top just because I'm feeling a glossy
lip like a glossy red lip for a change
no I mean to finish off the whole look
Ramona basically sent over a bunch of
different nail varnishes as well to sort
of go with the red theme so I'm gonna
choose one that matches the lipstick
I've also pop that on so the nail
varnish that I'm gonna use is from the
super gel collection
the reason I'm gonna use one of these is
because they're literally like some of
my favorite nail varnishes of all time
the way they work is that you have a
color which is like your step 1 and then
you've got stat 2 which is the gel
topcoat and honest to god these last so
long they never check they're like one
of the only nail varnishes that I've
found that don't chip on my nails the
top coat basically allows it to sort of
like dry and cure in natural daylight so
you don't need like the UV light and I
use these on a shoe like you might have
seen on a couple of adverts I did for a
mole earlier this year I think it was I
using it on a shoe and oh my god I fell
in love with them I went out to boots
and I've got so many of them so I'm
really glad that they've soaked some
more over feel like the darkest one
obviously matches my lips a lot better
this is in the shade 0 for 3 Venus so
this is the one that I'm going to
I literally just do like one or two
coats with the nail varnish I give it
about 30 seconds it doesn't need to be
like completely dry but alleged right a
little bit and then I go straight on top
with the top go and honestly it lasts so
long okay so I put it on and no more
like matching rapper to you here so yeah
that is the color Venus I'm absolutely
obsessed and it matches my lips so this
is now the finished look I really hope
you guys that liked it I personally love
the way it's turned out I feel like it's
really appropriate for autumn and winter
just like a really simple winged liner
and then a regular that is literally
what I think when I think of like winter
makeup so I absolutely love it hope you
