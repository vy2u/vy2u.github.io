to be a Sephora haul because I
accidentally bought a couple of little
bits and bobs while I was browsing away
on Sephora I really didn't want to buy
anything but all of a sudden stuff just
started making its way into my bag and
then before I knew that I was at the
checkout and then there's just nobody up
in there so here we are one of those
shops as well where it's that you didn't
really buy many things but the things
that you did buy were quite expensive so
if you like you spend so much money and
you don't really have that many products
this okay it's like a dig out some stuff
I'm at Beauty Bay as well which I will
show you afterwards and I'm going to
start with the stuff from Sephora I have
to say like older infants before in the
UK really using that bad even though
it's expensive the shipping is really
quick like it's usually three to seven
days and mine usually takes a lot less
and it asks all your taxes and stuff on
at the end there's no like hidden class
that there's no it's not like when I
order from like Kylie cosmetics and it
gets to the UK and it gets my door and
then all of a sudden I owe like eighty
pound in taxes it all just adds on at
the end so you know exactly what you pay
in and I usually just say about 370 so
it doesn't burn things it says I got a
bunch of the Sephora face masks these
are the pearl ones I love Sephora face
masks like if any of you watch my other
Sephora haul there's a good chance I
have ordered the format's in every
Sephora or that I've drawn first off the
smell of these are so good they smell
really like just soothe it cannot be a
smell I don't know but I've said it now
and it says it's enriched with natural
origin white pearl evens out skin tone
and help minimize irregularities
stimulate skin for high luminosity for
skin that is even fresher and brighter
the reason I like the pearl ones the
most is because I really do feel like my
skin is so moisturized and so sort of
like luminous afterwards I don't really
like obviously with a sheet mask as well
it's really handy because you can just
put it on at any time it's not like
messy got to wash it up afterwards you
just sort of massage in the excess I'm
still yet to try the origins sheet masks
that I got not too long ago if you
follow me on snapchat you'll know that
I've had a major skin issues recently so
I've not really been try
anything that new in terms of skincare
because I've been trying to let my skin
have a break I am going to try those
ones are like in my jaw here let you
know they're any good because it'd be
handy to have some that you can get me
okay thing I got it wrong well I got two
things from uh Nastasia Beverly Hills
actually got one of them so far which is
this and they got one from the UK
website which I'll show you in a minute
oh this is the lip palate because I have
seen this going around it thought I've
just seen this everywhere recently and
like I love the concept of it so much
because you really can create any Chloe
this because obviously it's got all the
neutrals and things towards the top and
but the fact that it gives you a white
of black of red a yellow and a blue like
your primary cook don't mind me it's
like your primary colors and your really
fun to create any color with this and
that's what I love about it obviously
it's not the most practical thing
intensive like I wouldn't use it if I
was doing my makeup to last a full day
because it's obviously not something you
can top up if you're not I mean as soon
as if you got like a little table and
you sort of scoop stuff out and create
colors and then put it into a part of it
differ in it but it kind of just waste
product in my opinion and so yeah it's
one thing to bear in mind obviously when
you use this you can't pop up really the
lip cool that you do but for someone who
is a makeup artist or someone who just
enjoys playing with makeup and
collecting makeup I feel like it's just
really good put up honestly just really
excited to play with it to be honest
because I feel like it just gives you
endless options so I'm going to give it
a go have a mix around it basically
comes with the palette and then you also
get a actual like sort palette that you
can mix the colors on and then you do
get a lip brush and like I think it's
like a scoop yeah so you've got a
spatula and a lip brush as well so that
all comes with the like the palette that
you paying for I think it was about $45
and if you like $40 in my bar and then
if you didn't know Anasazi and now has a
UK website it's just a Nastasia I'd like
to know what the link is and what
research and the size of your Beverly
Hills are pot link to it down below as
well and UK they do have a UK website
now so that's really handy so I picked
up the Nicole Gras
do not know how to say last name this is
the moment I feel like it's Nicole
Guerrero like I know how it sounds but
my masters doesn't want to say anyway I
picked up the cold glow kit because you
know originally I was not going to get
this because I saw it on again like
Instagram and job obviously we don't
have anistar to install so I just saw it
on my Instagram or social media and
because it's quite pinky oops sorry you
don't know I feel like a lot of the
colors well the top row in particular
obviously there's all kind of peaches
and pinks and I don't tend to go towards
highlighters that are like peachy
payment so that kind of left me would
just like the bottom row really and then
I was like okay well these kind of look
like the ones in my son ditch palette
and they look like other highlighters
that I have from - idea so long story
short I wasn't going to get and then my
friend Millie we went to London not so
long ago and she didn't take on the
train which I do not know how about girl
monitors I was she brought this palette
on the train and I started watching it
and I was like oh my goodness I actually
do quite need it thing is like when this
swatch they look so different so what
they look like in the pan I feel like
looking at them in the pan is what
popped me off and but when I started
watching them like I'll do some swatches
in a minute and when I started like
probably playing around with them I just
loved it like I loved it so much I was
like okay I'm sold
I can hello I'll do a couple of like
finger swatches like the pigmentation to
start is that is kitty cat which is the
top point there and and then I'll do
like the top three on my right hand and
then the other ones on my left hand so
those are those three there and honestly
honest after you do some of my favorite
highlighters and just like powder
products in general is so so creamy and
like so pigmented honestly absolutely
stunning and then on the bottom forever
lip resources I feel like it's so good
to have like a white highlight in a
palette and because it just makes all
the other highlighters like more
versatile in my opinion because you can
make the much better line in so those
about that as a more Goldy ones honestly
those are definitely more me and but I
feel like the more pinky rosy ones like
the peachy ones anyway I could still use
because they definitely swatch a lot
different to what they look like in the
pan in my opinion
and but honestly this palette Nicole not
that you will be watching this video but
this palette is stunning and I would be
so so proud if I had created this so
yeah I absolutely a little bit and and
I'm excited you have a play with it
because I feel like I'll get a lot of
use out of it because I definitely use
my other ones a lot I'm sorry that this
camera keeps like whenever I look to the
side it just wants to focus on the
background and I'm like no I still have
a fish what next okay the next bit I'm
really excited about because these were
in the new insert well two of them were
in the new in section and they're not
actually out in the UK yet as far as I
believe in Italy like I put these in my
basket and I'm nearly cried as at price
because I was just like so the next
three things are from Marc Jacobs beauty
and if you have watched some of my other
videos you'll know that I like the
glosses what else if I tried I like the
glasses and like the lip products in
general I have one of like the lip
creams and they're really lovely but I
hated the foundation so much like it
which is not for me it was way too full
coverage way to dry and like it just was
not for me but this range so these are
basically from the coconut range and a
few of them are new there's the face
mist which is this one it's also wears
it for the dew drops which when I heard
dew drops Tyler said okay and then one
that's been around a little bit longer
is the undercover perfection coconut
face primer which is like I'll get them
all out in a minute but that's like the
white face primer which has been out a
lot longer and and I just wanted to get
them because they sound a lot more me
obviously I do not have a face or a skin
or base product from Marc Jacobs that I
like yeah so I wanted to have a play
with like a different type of products
that they offer and hopefully I like
these things probably going to do a
video on Sunday where I test these out
because obviously we've got three
different products so I feel like it
makes a cool video and the first one
like I said is the primer this is what's
been out the longest and I have heard so
many good things about this I've picked
a little ol what particularly from
people like Jacqueline Hale and people
who I know have a similar skin type to
me I just heard really good things about
this it's literally just a white primer
and what does it claim to do it has
instantly instantly impeccable skin
smoothing
makeup Maximizer
sound good and then the next thing are
the dew drops I'm pretty sure these only
came in one shade these are in the shade
at golden glow and again they are like a
coconut product from Marc Jacobs beauty
and it just says instant highlight
golden glow coconut Delite so alright
it's the same packaging so it's got the
white lid the foundation I had had a
black cliff and and these just look
really pretty
honestly I'm looking at the bottle and
I'm like mmm I might you like I really
want to do like a little swatch but I
feel like I want to save it it comes
with a pump which I like um I'm going to
save it for some day because I think I'm
going to do let me know if you want to
see like a little bit of a video and
with a bit of a review on these things
because I'll do that if you want to see
it I'm honestly this is what I'm most
excited about because I love a good
liquid illuminator I'm pretty sure you
can use these as like liquid highlight
or to like mix into foundation and you
know I'm going to read up about them
because it's not a lot of info on the
box but let me know if you want to see
them in some this video and I'll give
them a go and then the last one which
I've just got highlighter all over from
my fingertips this is the recover
perfection coconut second myth which
again you all know that I love a good
setting straight the one by Urban Decay
the chill one is my all-time favorite
I've tried I try to graph you and that
one just doesn't get replaced like it's
always been my favorite so I mean I'm
hoping this one does it because of this
more expensive it says it's a 24 hour
setting perfection slowing hydration
coconut lips develop dust so again it oh
it's like a white liquid okay and
whether it's like a like a white liquid
which I did not expect I expected it to
be clear maybe I don't know like you can
see the packaging that looks like this I
just thought the bottle with Wyatt boys
actually that the liquid that's white
and so yeah it just looks like so again
it's just got the white lid think that's
leaks a bit oh it's leaked a bit and it
smells just like coconut don't know what
I'll say expected but there you go I
can't remember the price point of all of
these
but there will be linked down below and
like I said I don't think they're
available in the UK yet because I
actually the reason I went on safari was
because I was trying to find these in
the UK like on John Willis and stuff and
they weren't out yeah so I just gotten
one for instead okay and then I got a
couple of things from beautybay which I
will quickly show you as well I feel
like I didn't really get anything from
Sephora but believe me it cost me like a
nominal so I've got two pairs of lashes
from violet boss I have to say now
they're calm I'm looking at them in the
box and I'm like okay so the first pair
is Val tress which look like so I'll
show you probably close-up when the
camera wants to focus and they're
imagine me a little bit ikonics as you
can see but they don't look is fluffy
like the reason I got them is because
they look like a fluffier version of
ikonics because I used to love iconic
lashes so much bite house of lashes but
they feel it the two plastic-looking now
on me and I feel like now I just got
used to wearing J makeup Lily lashes
which are really fluttery I don't like
wearing ikonics anymore because they
look so obviously fake so when I was
looking online these look like a more
fluffy version of this which I'm hoping
they are I'm going to give them a go
they were about 15 plan settings then
these ones are what style are they they
do not have a name
oh it says I want it that way so these
are limited edition so mink lashes and
to be honest like I'm really not sure
I'm feeling these either because they're
like double layered lashes but they
they're really obviously separated like
I don't know if the cameras going to
pick it up but I don't know if you can
see like the longer lashes underneath
you can't really tell on camera what
they're really like obviously separate
it's like the more curl lashes that the
top layer so again I'll probably try
them on give them a go see how I'm Chyna
just like venture in terms of lashes
because I really got into like a run
where just wearing Lily lashes doing
makeup and knees which are Rodeo Drive
by buck-toothed rushes and and I kind of
went oh I don't want to stick to what
and also from at beautybay I got a
skincare product this is the Mario
Badescu and dryly
because when I was having my skin issues
which I am still have been like you
can't really tell on camera because we
are getting a lot better but they're
kind of still there and a lot of people
on Twitter recommended there's also a me
just like much myself
Amy from Amy's makeup box also said that
she absolutely loves it as well so I
thought I would pick it up and give it a
go
and I've only tried it once and from
what I from that what from that time
that I used it I did really like it
obviously I've not used it a lot to have
like a full opinion on it but to be
honest if you want to see a video on the
products that I use to clear my skin
then do let me know because I really did
have like a breakout like I've never had
a breakup before like I went to the
doctor's twice because I was just like
help me and I know that it just doesn't
look like it on camera but I promise it
is still her a little bit it's just
because I've really covered it with
foundation and things that you can't
really tell but the texture is kind of
still very tiny bear and if you want to
see a video or like if you want me to
just include it in a vlog or something
like that then let me know in the
comments because I'd be happy to because
I feel like I used and tried like a good
amount of products when my skin was
really breaking out suits for like a
good two weeks or so where it was just
like not calming down and I feel like
there was definitely a like three or
four things that I use a really good
help so if you want me to share those
then let me know and I'll do a video on
it and I didn't realize this from what I
used
I only use it once and but it was
interested it's kind of like basically
it's like a dry drained lotion so it
comes in like a liquid like this and
you're not supposed to shake it so
there's usually like a watery section at
the top and and there's like a lotion at
the bottom and you scoop it out with
like a cotton bud and then you just
apply it on problem areas so I just used
to like well i justed it on my kind of
breakouts my spots which was pretty much
my whole forehead I'm not so high and it
was an interesting sensation because it
kind of stung a little bit which I was
surprised by expecting it to feel like
really soothing but it did kind of sting
when I first applied it and it's
obviously like pink so it goes on pink
and then it dries and it sets and I just
slept in it overnight and when I woke up
the next morning I have to admit like a
lot of it come off
move your muscly which is kind of odd
and but it did definitely do a good job
of like drying out the oils from like my
spots and things so I'm pretty sure
that's like what this is designed to do
it kind of just drives everything out so
it just pops off yeah from what I use of
it it was good and it's obviously
available and affordable as well because
I'm Beauty Bay and Mario Badescu is not
a particularly high end brand and so
it's like about 12 tons 14 pounds or
something like that okay - at last
things from Beauty Bay so I got two
products from Milani the first one is
the concealed and perfect to my
foundation and concealer this is in the
light issue because as you can probably
Maitri tell I'm kind of embracing like
my fairness a little bit more recently I
just honestly can't be arsed time right
now let's give this a go anyway because
I have heard a really like really good
things about it and I'm pretty sure it's
supposed to just be yeah it says medium
to full coverage lightweight oil-free
long wearing it was too resistant and
sweat proof and the only thing I'm
worried about is that when because it
says all your free that usually means
it's kind of like satin matte and I
don't like a satin or matte foundation
like as much as a naturally Julie or you
know me or give a go hopefully it will
be wonderful because obviously Milani as
well it's relatively I say relatively
affordable what the stuff on that is
kind of pricey but from what I've tried
in the past I do really like the brand
and then we also have a highlighter this
is the strobe light and the shade
afterglow which is the paler shade and
just because I really want to give this
a go
I'm not gonna learn so it just comes in
a plastic packaging it like so and it's
got a gold back it kind of has like a
running nose knit it looks like a sort
of pale champagne a slightly peachy but
Goldy shimmer salamé
so that is it there and swatches really
lovely it feels very creamy
definitely isn't as pigmented as all the
highlighters that I have but it's not
like a bad thing like it's still fairly
good obviously I have to try it on the
cheeks and stuff to have a good idea but
that is it back you can kind of tell
those are the Anastasi Nicole ones from
before
yeah looks pretty it's like a pinky
goalie champagne color but that was
pretty much everything I picked up from
Sephora and beat eBay so I really hope
you all enjoyed this video give it a
thumbs up if you did and subscribe if
you're not already because I would love
that and let me know if you tried any of
these products yourself and what your
thoughts were and let me know if you
want me to do a video on Sunday on the
new mutt cheek of coconuts off because I
will if you want it but I think that's
everything it for now so thank you so
much for watching I love you guys to the
moon and back and I will see you in
Sunday Co</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
