you're all well and having a lovely day
I look so pale
right now but it's about to change
because we're gonna do a bit of makeup
today well today's video we're gonna be
testing it revolution Pro because I've
been seeing a lot of their products
floating around in super drug and stuff
like that and I thought be fun to test
them out in a video so from what I
understand this is basically a I want to
say like a sister / side brand -
revolution so revolution used to be
called makeup revolution it's now just
revolution by itself and I think so
there's just like revolution as a brand
and I think they've brought this out as
like a side thing so this is more like I
don't know if it's supposed to be like
better quality or what I did not come to
this video bearing pads haha from what I
understand this is like a section of
stuff within revolution I don't know if
it's supposed to be like that quality
design for like professional use maybe
revolution Pro that's like the Bible get
in also in a different area today I'm in
front of this little backdrop which is
actually the backdrop that I used to use
in all of my makeup videos like when I
had the flat and when I used to work at
home and a little bit more room that as
well so that's what this is let me know
what you prefer because I'm basically
just testing the waters with a bunch of
different stuff at the minute so let me
know if you prefer this or if you prefer
like the fairy lights and the desk and
like the little plants and stuff I think
I'm just gonna tie my hair back for this
because honestly it is hot in this room
I think this was one of the only brow
products they had this is the revolution
Pro it doesn't even say anything on the
actual brow pencil okay I'm pretty sure
this is I actually started the packaging
this is the revolution Pro micro
bleeding effect pencil in the shade dark
brown so they have this and then I think
they also did like a dip brow pomade
pomades palmate people always call me
out when I say that it reminds me a lot
of precisely my brow by benefit it's
just like a really precise brow pencil
so I'm just gonna be using this to fill
in my brows I much prefer like a precise
at brow pencil to anything like chunkier
I used to use goof proof by benefit
which I used to absolutely love but
recently I just find that like a smaller
brow pencil is so much easier to use
like
way more control I really shouldn't have
taught my striker in my house because
that is gonna affect how well it shows
up well I feel like that did a good job
easy to apply nice and creamy I like the
color of it it's not too warm I'm gonna
go in with the full coverage camouflage
concealer in the shade at c6 I got this
in the shade c6 because I just assumed
because my concealer shade in the other
concealer is c7 that it just March this
is actually quite dark though so I
didn't get any brushes by the way I
don't think from what I saw on the stand
and Superdrug that wasn't really any
brushes at all but I could have been
wrong I could have just not been looking
properly knowing me okay so I'm just
gonna this is a thick concealer I swatch
this we thought this is so thick so like
it just feels thick I can't explain it
or describe it any other way it's just
thick so I'm just needs to like carve
out the brow a little bit as well oh my
god who's been watching love island me
feel like every year I just get so
sucked in I don't think I'm enjoying it
as much this year like I don't know why
I think some of the people I'm just not
a fan of like at the minute it just
feels like there's no proper couples or
anything other than Wes and Laura but
there's something about them that I just
don't buy like I don't know why I'd to
know and I just think it was so funny
how I feel like Laura just completely
changed a tune about where's when she
found out that he'd spent loads with
money on that day and when Adam kind of
pider cuz I feel like she was trying it
on a little bit with Adam when he first
came in I don't know there's just
something about her that I just don't
mm-hmm Adam so Erik and it drives me
absolutely insane like I'm so sad
Kendall had to leave what shouldn't have
to leave obviously well she did have to
leave because she didn't get coupled up
with someone cuz I feel like she was one
of the only people in there that was
just so genuinely she just seemed like a
nice girl I'm gonna go in with the
revolution Pro regeneration gold mine
palette which just looks like so so they
had two pellets like this install this
one and they were both quite
that other one was more like reds and
pinks and oranges so I wasn't more drawn
to it but I thought no like best get
something a little bit more out of my
comfort zone even though this is still
warm shades so I'm gonna start with this
shade down here which is called VIP and
just pop that in the crease it's just
kind of like a peachy transition color I
would say so I'm literally just gonna
start puttin that in there
that's actually not as warm as I thought
it was gonna be it kind of comes it's
coming out like a little bit pink on my
skin I don't know why I'm gonna mix in a
little bit of royalty which is the shade
here that is literally such a pretty
color
like honestly so I'm literally just
building up that royalty color just like
a really pretty bright orange and I'm
just taking it all the way in and all
the way out and then I'm gonna go in
with this shade here which i think is
called bourgeois I want to say wow that
is so pigmented I'm gonna take it in a
little bit as well to the inner part of
the crease and then I'm just gonna go
back in no extra product which is the
brush that had the orange shade on and
just buff it out a little bit into the
orange OOP skipped a bit ah this is what
happens because I hey I sometimes get a
little bit too excited with my blending
and I just go so crazy and if you don't
like take your time and do it softly
then you end up with shadow like all the
way out here that you just don't want
that's that oh that fix itself really
easily actually which I like I'm gonna
go in with the shade billionaire though
which is just like a really warm for Chi
Brown I might just go in on my finger
I've actually broken a nail so I'm gonna
make use of the fact that I don't have a
claw on this finger and just go straight
in oh my gosh that didn't even show up I
saw okay oh interesting and so when I'm
trying to apply it with my finger it
swatches really well like I don't know
if you can see there's loads of pigment
on my finger but then it's not
transferring on smiley
try going in with a brush instead mm
yeah so it seems to apply a lot better
with a brush and then I'm just gonna go
in with the shade Hollywood which is
just this really dark brown I'm just
gonna run that along towards the lashes
and also like flick it up a little bit
at the outer V so I'm just gonna sit
some lashes on because they didn't have
any Lisa just sung by Lily lashes and
I'll be right back claw primer I've
picked up two so we've got the
revolution Pro and perfecting
featherweight primer they did these in a
bunch of different versions so I'm
pretty sure they had one that was for
Blair in one that was for like
mattifying maybe they kind of remind me
of the makeup forever primers and then
we've also got the revolution Pro at
prime oil which I actually just read the
instructions on the back of this and
it's basically just an oil that you can
use day and night so probably not like
the best primer but it's called prime
oil so and then in terms of foundation I
got the revolution Pro foundation drops
there was this one and one more
foundation I think which was kind of
like in a squeezy tube and but I quite
like the idea of a jock foundation and
I've not used one in a really long time
so I thought we'd give this a go so I
might go in with the oil on one side and
then the featherweight one on the other
side and see what works best under the
foundation I cannot get my words out am
i okay
no see it's literally just an oil which
is what makes me think it's probably not
for prime in but it's called a prime oil
so I feel like that's to seep in I don't
know and then I'm gonna use the cream
like the more creamy primer on the other
last are you white so yeah I'm gonna
just apply this all over the skin and
then we're gonna see which side it looks
better if there's like any difference at
all you only know how many drops you
need of this but we're just gonna wing
it
and I'm just gonna blend it in with a
sponge because I didn't pick up any
brushes and I feel like it's quite a
liquidy foundation so it will work well
with a sponge I'm hoping smells like
cakes my bits my sponge I don't know
something smells like biscuits it's a
very jewy is the first thing I've
noticed in not a full coverage at all
it's kind of like the light medium I
would say oh my gosh I look so I mean
it's definitely buildable because it's
built quite well I feel like we've got a
good medium to full coverage out of
there I'm gonna go back onto concealer
I'm gonna try and use the concealer that
we used to prime the eyes which was the
full coverage camouflaged concealer this
is in the shade c6 I'm just worried that
it's gonna be too thick for under my
eyes and B it's not gonna be the right
color so they have a concealer palette
that I really wish I could have got but
it just wasn't in the store like it
wasn't in super super took that I went
in with that considering it's so thick
like it does blend out fairly well like
that blended out pretty quick in my
opinion I mean so that actually doesn't
feel that heavy on the skin like it
doesn't feel heavy under the eyes it
definitely is like full coverage sorry
I'm gonna powder I've got the loose
finishing powder
they had this version and then also a
pressed version just a white powder I'm
so picky with setting powders and loose
powders I just want this to be good what
I'm gonna do so that we get a bit of
comparison is I'm gonna set one side
with the loose powder and then one side
with Rimmel stay matte which is a
pressed powder and one that I really
love just so that we can compare the two
and see like what they look like
side-by-side because Rimmel stay matte
is what I would usually use to set up
under my eyes this is just the
transparent one so it's not
any color to it really yes oh I
definitely prefer Rimmel stay matte but
even the Rimmel stay matte side it's
gone a bit funny you know when you set
concealer and it goes a bit like cakey
it's kind of done that which is so weird
because most times want to use that
powder it's absolutely fine I couldn't
ever have problems with it but it's done
it this side as well with the makeup
revolution powder so I'm gonna assume
it's lip concealer um it's just gone
like a little bit Betty and cakey like
under my eyes which is a bit weird that
powder I'm not a fan of it reminds me a
lot of um like the NYX Ultra HD loose
powder which again I don't like it
reminds me of the nip and fab Wang which
I'm not a massive fan of it's just very
powdery which I know sounds way to
describe a powder like that it's just
very chalky I don't know how to explain
it like if anyone's tried the NYX ultra
HD powder then I feel like you'll know
what I mean because it feels just like
that okay I'm going to set the rest of
the face and I'm just gonna use Rimmel
stay matte because I know this is a
powder that I like in all fairness to
the foundation that oh the foundation
actually looks really pretty feel like
now that we're setting it down with a
bit of powder as well like it's
definitely helping just gonna clean my
lips okay so as I've said that when any
bronzes or contour powders so I'm just
gonna use the k'kaw contour kit just
because that's what's on my desk and so
this is in the shade light and I'm just
gonna mix the two I kind of like stipple
with this bronzer brush I think cuz it's
so big like it works quite well when you
sort of just really lightly dab it onto
the skin and then soften it out with a
sponge rather than sweeping it and then
yeah I literally just really gently
press this skin with the same sponge
that I use for foundation okay onto the
highlighter I saw these install and fell
in love so the first product we've got
is the revolution Pro supreme
highlighter in the style metal which is
the these three shades here so we've got
like a bronzy color at the top of gold
and then more of like a champagne color
at the bottom and then we've got the
revolution Pro
highlights a pallet in the shade
rose-gold
I think which I've genuinely got it just
for this shade here because I think this
is absolutely stunning does look a
little bit more glittery though so I
think I'm gonna try this first and then
maybe go in with one of the other shades
just gonna apply that I don't usually
wear more pinky at highlights but I just
saw this and I thought it was absolutely
stunning oh my gosh I love that very
similar to the l'oreal rose quartz
highlighter which i also really loved i
don't want to add too much on the rest
of the skin because i feel like we're
already so julius it is okay i'm gonna
finish off the eyes and i'm just gonna
blend the same shades underneath so I'm
going to use royalty and splendid
actually which is a little bit darker
than the VIP I feel like I said I wasn't
gonna do a warm look or something that I
would usually do and this is kind of
something that I'll usually do but it is
what it is and then you just want to do
a little bit of lower lash mascara so
I'm just using iconic mascara I think
they did have some mascaras how many
times can i say mascara but i don't like
to buy numerous cars unless i need to
because it's the one thing that i always
end up having so many of because i feel
like it takes you so long to get 3-1 so
i don't like to buy them really unless
i'm like in need of one because i think
it's a bit like wasteful otherwise cuz i
just don't get around to using all of
them and then last but not least we've
got lips so i actually picked up one of
these little collections this is the
revolution pro lipstick collection in
the shades well the collection matte
nude so i think they have this color and
then maybe a red collection as well I'm
not entirely sure so those are the
shades there we've got the shades truth
real raw protect which is that shape
there and then the last shade is naked
which is that kind of pinky shade up
there they're all quite pink other than
this shade so that was the shade real
which is kind of more of a brownie nude
so I'm going to go with that one cuz I
feel like the eyes are quite like more
on the brown side in the pink side so
this is pretty
much at the finish look I have to say a
plane that lips it without a lip liner I
just can't do that like I can't believe
I'm without lip liner I find it's so
hard but I do really like the way it
came out the skin actually looks really
nice the foundation who surprised me
because I feel like when we first put it
on I was a bit worried that it was going
to look a little bit crazy but now that
it's sat and stuff it just has a really
nice natural glow to it and the
highlighter I'm I'm living for I'm
obsessed with brows look really good and
the bronzer obviously wasn't revolution
the eyes look really good lip color I
absolutely love as well like it's a
really nice peachy nude but yeah all in
all I'm pretty impressed let me know
what you think in the comments down
below and let me know if you tried any
of these yourself because I would love
to know other than that I think that's
everything so I'm gonna get going thank
you so much for watching I love you guys
for muna back a million times over and
I'll see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
