going to be a try on a clothing haul
because I am actually going on holiday
next week I'm going on holiday in five
days I'm so excited
being cane are going to cards in Greece
I've never been before I actually cannot
wait like the hotel and the whole area
just looks insane so I'm so excited to
go ahead and so I ordered some new
goodies to take with me if anyone's been
before like things are cars then let me
know what it's like and if there's
anything that you think we need to do
while still there because we want to
just have as much fun as possible so
really excited and I'm just going to get
into it I'm going to start with proceed
little thing oh this is like online
stuff by the way yes the first thing I
didn't really get the holidays watch for
probably I might still take it and I
just want to show it anyway and this is
a pop that pretty little things have
brought out it's one of the Manchester
pop tops so they do it in this color
which is like a navy with white caps and
they also do it in a grey and I think
they've also got maybe like a jump or
something as well they've basically got
like a little mini collection where
they're selling these kind of tops all
the money is going to go to the
Manchester spawn which is of course like
super important to raise money for and
be aware of and things like that I know
that in the style have got one as well I
think they've got like a bumblebee pop
so either way like it's just like a
really nice way I think to donate a
little bit of money and contribute and
stuff because you get in a really cute
top in the process as well and
absolutely looks like I'll still or just
up where a monk Union and proud yeah
it's obviously really important so I
just wanted to mention that before
anything else the next thing which is
actually specifically for holiday this
is a like a beach kimono which I'm not
hard for second star so bad I've not had
for the previous two holidays that I've
been on this year but I just wanted
something like to throw on and support
over stuff just like bikinis and things
like that when you're going to the beach
or stop by the pool or whatever this one
is just white a happy and black as well
blue wasn't in my size I don't think it
was in soccer cart remember and but the
thing that I love it's got a little like
frilled sleeves at the end which I
thought was super cute so I can't really
show the whole thing but I'll have time
clip so you'll see it anyway every but
it looks completely floor-length on the
model so I'm really excited to try backs
actually got a little mark on it pretty
little thing speaking it in a size six
which I'm kind of nervous about because
I'm usually eight ten but
have either an 8 or 10 so I thought I
will just give this a go because it's
just like a kimono anyway I'm just
hoping it's going to fit so I'm really
excited to try that on and have it from
the beach in the pool ok next super
random I just got a little crop top so
this is a crop t-shirt I saw their
banner so it was so cute which is so
cute it's just a new color and it's got
white and did we want to call these it's
just like white stitching and like costs
around the neckline on the sleeves so
it's just short-sleeved and then it's
also got a really cute detail where you
can like wrap it around the waist and
like you back and stuff and just to go
with like jeans shorts and things like
that I've not only had many crop tops
this season so carries one okay and then
I got to sort of like a Bardot top
because I'm really loving this style of
top of the minute which is kind of like
it's like a bundle like a Bardot that
just goes oh bebe peas and so then it's
just got a little Bardot sleeves as well
so this one has like huge oversized bell
sleeves so they go really wide at the
ends and it's just like a white sort of
shift running eat material and you never
know let's say that way and it does tie
up as well so it'd be easy to show when
it's actually on but that is what it
looks like
feels like nice quality what still nice
and thin which is obviously really
important in summer when it's going hot
haha and then it this one isn't so much
for holiday but I just love the style of
this I've seen it everywhere recently on
like different sites and on Instagram
and like YouTube videos and things like
that so I wanted to pick one cup myself
again issues a similar sales it's like a
bun dough it's actually a committed
material and then it's just got longer
sleeves again but it kind of has like
this sort of thick neck with like frills
around the top and the bottom and it
just looks like I can just imagine it
being really cute with like jeans or
ripped shorts or something like that so
I didn't let's pick it up so I feel like
it'll be a nice piece for like autumn
winter as well because you could
definitely layer it and it is thick
if thick material so that is that right
and then this last thing is way brighter
like it's so bright in its way right and
xsb
and so this is a high leg screams ooh
it's you can see a bright orange color
which I don't really feel like orange is
my color but I'll just slap on the fake
tan and hopefully I'll be fine
I do actually have one of these from
pretty pretty
nothing already it's a black line like
because that came from soot but in black
and I have in a size six so I thought I
should wear this women too because the
style of it I don't know if you'll be
able to tell it's like super high alert
but you can see that it's basically a
song at the back cuz I'm not going to
lie and but it's super high leg and the
reason I can't let the six as like
natural swimsuit is because it comes up
like basically to my boobs like that's
how I come so I do wear it as a bodysuit
because I love the top half like it's
just like you can sort of do it is like
multi way I'll just like tie it on your
neck or whatever and I love the material
of it kind of like a slinky material and
what I just wanted to get one in a
different size so I think I've got this
in what try figure is I've got it in a
ten just hoping that it won't be like
too sure on the leg is that make sense
like hoping I'll have more material to
go on here so I can actually wear as a
swimsuit and but yeah they do have in
black as well it just didn't have no did
they have the right size in the Box
remember this top is also from pretty
little things if anyone's wondering the
reason I've quite like props here is
because right I'll leave this top down
below I really love it but it's like
completely see-through but you can just
see nipples everywhere not I have more
than two you're not I mean there's just
like mean it's cool so I don't really
know how to wear this because like it's
backless as well like it's got like no
baskets you've got straps of Tiran back
so I don't know it's cute though let's
cut off and then a from new look super
unknown but I just picked up a pair of
lace-up sandals because this exact style
of sandal I've been wearing you can't
really see it you can see it mother and
I've been wearing it all the time like a
special holiday on my past future it's
just such a complete and all but it's
still like you can still work out an
evening because it's got like a heel and
because it's like been shot since does
it still looks like kind of glum and it
literally just ties up around the leg
I'll include like a trial clip as well
but the reason I got some more is
because my first bag from a sauce which
is the only part I have they are ruined
like they're just all the descriptions
and I do like to replace shoes like when
they need replacing because we just saw
something about Susan C I'm just like
Nettie's or 25 pound at 99 I don't know
how much everything was by the way
people always ask me to put like and
things on the screen of like how much I
business but I do link all the products
down below so in the description by you
just have to click it in Alitalia
but this has a label only 220 26 pounds
they're also wide fit as well as I'm
hoping they're going to stick better
than meiosis ones because must be our
wide girl wide and I'm a size four if
anyone wants to know I've got baby fee
is no I'm pretty too long like 5/7 not
really proportional it's fine no decided
I hope they will be okay and I'll sit
and I'll look the feel the tiny bit
bigger than Mary cost long but you know
what I'm ready for it I'm ready for an
upgrade okay so this next thing is from
Oh Polly I basically wanted like a
really cute little body con just to add
because our chicken became birthday
laughter away hence why we're like going
in the middle of July and I probably
stress and I'm sure I got it in white
what to me this looks like silver
because they do have a silver one as
well well the label says Wyatt and
underside half anyway it's a little body
contrast it's got adjustable straps it's
like a kind of square neckline and I
like the stuff from Oh Polly because
it's always really thick like if you
want a good reliable like bodycon dress
or leggings like leggings and crop tops
and jumpsuit anything like that they
always make their clothes really thick
so you don't get any visible panty line
or anything like that showing tree limbs
from where whatever underneath and it's
fine but yeah I saw this dress that was
very cute because then it just looks
very holiday appropriate it's supposed
to be white whether it actually is I
don't know I maybe I'm just being like
duh we had it in like silver and black
as well and it's just like kind of like
a metallic material it's like a missing
material book because it's quite sure
and it's a body con like I feel like it
was really nice in the evenings on
holiday and stuff and it does also come
with a choke right in fact yeah so the
choker has a white bit on it actually is
it why I don't know yeah it comes with a
choker as well so it is to touch for you
from where if you want we don't have to
it's just exacting material as a dress
and it's got a bit on at the butt as
well just to help get it up and it's
like she just got like spaghetti straps
and then it's just like sure it looks
short and module and that's the only
thing that sometimes concerned with like
short dresses because like with being
tall as well things just arise or
Maibaum like so quickly so I'm going to
try it on and if it's not appropriate
then it will have to be sent back but
hopefully it will be alright okay laughs
lot of stuff is from in the style is
actually from this era range because I
don't look at
mine after I saw Jordan wearing a couple
other pieces in Ibiza and it's such a
stunning range but I just wanted to pick
up a couple of it just a couple of it
for holiday at the time as well they
actually had 25 percent shooting
discount which half say having a younger
brother is very handy indeed so the
first thing I got I actually got two of
these which is slightly different colors
as I was saying I haven't really had
like any little crop tops I don't even
like that this year so I just got two of
the crop tops that kind of like Hulse
next we just like do up with the little
strings so this one is the white with a
sort of nude contrast around the bottom
and like the whole neckline stuff and
then I just got the opposite as well
which is like noodle over with bits of
white just to go with like denim shorts
good chocolate over bikinis and I don't
think that that just for like holiday
okay and then I saw this swimsuit and I
was like I need it I absolutely need it
so again there's two different color
colors of these but I went with the
white and the peach so it's kind of hard
to show our camera and it's just like a
swimsuit that basically kind of looks
like like a bikini but it kind of joins
it the size with these little metal
rings so just like a normal bikini pop
would just like the round neck and stuff
and then it has like the cutout all the
way around like the middle and like the
back area and stuff and then it just
goes in it to the bikini bottoms which
are a different color and then I got one
other bikini bikini these so Jordan
Matthews in hand on holiday and it
looked in seen on Ash and it has a small
bikini but she has a bottoms and then I
went online and they thought I saw that
they do in white and I've been desperate
for a white bikini for so long because I
just think white looks incredible and
holiday like with it time and stuff
even though I always ruin white
swimsuits might be nice because I wear
fake times it's not Pauline so it's just
literally bikini dies at Keeney's heart
and literally just a bun dough it was
like 17 pounds for the window I like it
feels pretty basic I'm not going to lie
because when I said when I originally
put it in my basket before the whole
shoot a discount on I was like 70 so
like 16 or 17 pounds for bungo and I was
just like oh because like this was 16
pounds of something is also like to 80
pounds from for bikini which isn't like
I know it's not crazy but I was just
like when it's just a white thunder like
I don't know there's just get something
else liable and then the butt
and are just yeah literally just why
normal like bikini briefs and they state
babe on the back in like a gold text
which is just felt was super cute okay
and then the last thing that I got which
is hopefully going to be a I basically
got this and the backup in case the
white of Palawan doesn't work because as
I said like it looks quite sure on a
model so I wanted to have like a bit of
a backup for a dress the King's birthday
in case that just look like so this
is like the sort of maxi dress again I
think this is like in like a couple of
different colors and this is just like
the tan one so it's literally just like
a v-neck like so and then it's got
double straps as a buck which you can
just like adjust and tighten which is
fast and then it just goes into I'm
pretty sure it like slips and stuff it's
not like a full maxi on things but it's
pretty long wait just like splits on the
sides and things look really sad again
on the website and I actually have
something kind of similar to this and
that I wore on the last Ibiza joke but I
just wanted something a little bit
different that I can like pair with my
embellished like Rollins just because I
love that kind of vibe like it looks so
fast so that is basically in my little
backup in case my old poly one doesn't
fit but either way like if they both
work and I'll take them both because
they're both like lovely dresses I don't
think boys and girls that's it that was
everything that I picked to it for
holiday obviously I have like a couple
of other bits as well but I kind of just
wanted to add a little bit more in if
you feel me even though it seems like a
lot like I probably got way more than I
need to - I hope you all enjoyed this
video and I hope we all having a
wonderful summer let me know or your
