feel like it's absolutely huge I mean I
just look a bit of a hot minute hey guys
it's Han so today's video is going to be
a clothing haul because if you follow me
on social media and you've watched some
of my other videos and things like that
you'll know that I recently went on a
trip to I beat that with a brand called
I saw it first which is the clothes and
run that I'm going to hold today I was
so lucky to go literally it was one of
the coolest trips I've ever been I've
never actually been to Ibiza so I had no
idea what it was going to be like but it
was amazing the group of girls that we
got was well just incredible like the
whole trip which is so much fun like it
was like just I need it you know just
letting it go yeah - it was amazing the
brand itself I saw it first is an online
clothing brand and I'll leave all the
links down below and of course I'll link
every single products I whole
individually as well if you want to get
anything to sell look at that it's going
to its go in touch we leave it in a pony
I don't really know I'm just going to
let it do its thing yeah like I said
everything will be linked down below
it's always been a moody's as a try on
like I always do so that you can see
what the clothes look like on as well so
hot here don't worry about jump on ok so
I'm going to start with the things that
I actually got lost I was there in Ibiza
so this is the first top right here I
love succubus Roxy has this as well like
if you follow Roxanna Instagram if you
don't go and follow it I'll Florence
from down below she has a couple of
photos wearing this top and she looks
insane in it I'm not actually trying on
you out some hoping that I'll love Chris
conserve because she looks insane in it
but it's literally just a little crop
top and it's white nothing and like just
why um fabric as you can see so this
Patrick quite a boo-boo seller and then
it's just messing and then it goes into
a little Bardot sleeves like so and it
just looks so cute looks really lovely I
think Roxy said it with high-waisted
trousers I believe and it looks amazing
them but anything high-waisted obviously
perfect super crotch if you like
anything high waisted like short skirt
trousers anything like that one look
amazing it with this so that is what the
first piece it looks like this is in a
size 8 okay and then as I was saying
because I'm negligent I wish the charges
now but they basically have these wide
leg trousers and they have them in a
bunch of different colors and the
quality of them is insane like I
struggle finding charles's that just
right in general and lot good and things
like that look these are stunning I'm
obsessive these are obviously the black
ones and they're literally just
high-waisted like this so anyways and
that they've got a little zipper at the
box as well and then they just go down
into really long wide leg trousers but I
wish you could feel them because they're
so sick like you can just tell the
quality is insane and I'm pretty sure
Sabrina yes Sabrina wore these one night
as I look amazing in them
Jordan more than one night as well just
look so good on everyone next is just a
little pink bralette so I actually have
another one to show you in a minute
that's kind of similar and but this one
is just a pink sort of floral and yeah
right and it's got sort of like the
wiring and stuff and like the shape
which is really nice and it's just got
little roses other roses that little
eyes just little flowers all over I have
got a bit better back as well just like
a gold lip to help you get it on over
those movies and yeah it just looked
really really cute I'm really excited to
try this on as well as I love stuff like
this with somewhere like I just feel
like it looks so nice with the pad like
jeans or shorts or something like that
so that is okay and then next scene they
had so many like Bardot tops and Bardot
blouses on the website and I absolutely
love this one so this is just white
again and it's basically just got blue
flowers all around the top so it kind of
just has this elastic where it goes like
off the shoulder and then it's just got
the blue flowers and it just goes down
it's like a really nice little floaty
love feels really lovely like it feels
good quality but not happy if that makes
sense which is good for some motifs
obviously you don't want anything to set
it looked again lovely on the model I
just love stuff like this for pairing
with like jeans like when you're going
for lunch or when you just like going
shopping and things like that because it
still looks kind of casual but it looks
really nice okay and then this is going
to be hard to show because it's black
and but this is just a jumpsuit so I've
honestly been on the hanukkah ages now
or what feels like ages and it's just
like literally a plain black body kana
jumpsuit because I love wearing black as
you all know and I love things that I
just like jumpsuits that you can
literally walk on and obviously how
where jumpsuits when I go out but I
needed some that were more casual for
like daytime and stuff so this one is
just like a jersey material and you
can't really see it very well but it's
just like quite it's like a round neck
at the top and then it dips down a
little bit more at the butt
does have a zip which is quite nice and
then it just goes down into like the
legs and things like that they are
slightly cropped and lemons I chose them
because I honestly do just love throwing
things on for like days out and things
like that because I love feeling
confident comfortable comfy I love it
feeling it can't be but still being able
to like play around with an outfit
because things like this you can really
add jewelry and I was like a bell and
things like that and just make it like a
little bit more like that make sense so
excited to try this on hopefully it says
it does feel quite big like as I'm
holding it it's not expense but it
should fit reasonably well exercise okay
and then it's super basic but I just got
a plain white v-neck top because I
haven't honestly been lucky one in my
wardrobe but you know when you just want
to put on a pair of jeans and just put a
white t-shirt on I just not have the
white t-shirt for the outfit and so I
just saw this on the website I love a
good for you next because I feel like
you can wear like a really pretty
bralette and stuff and it looks like it
looks more torn off if that makes sense
and I love the fact that this one has
rolled sleeves because for some reason I
just in love what role they must use up
so it's handy that this is doing it for
me and yeah it's just like a pretty
basic like white t-shirt it's a normal
length it's not cropped or anything like
that again feels really nice quality and
so yes just as talking with like jeans
and things like that
okay and then as I said before I have
another bralette so it kind of like is
similar style to the floral one and but
it's just like different colors and a
different pattern so it shows the plain
white and I actually got this to go with
the camel and wide leg trousers because
it has like a nude mesh underneath it
like it's kind of like nests in a
machine it has like a nude panel
underneath so I feel like it'll look
really good the thing I like about these
as well which I didn't mention before I
do have adjustable straps because that
is like an essential for me like I feel
like it's so important to be able to
adjust straps to like your chest size
and like how you like things to lock in
things like that like it's so important
for me some reason really excited to try
these because I do love a good growler
as I was saying before and this one's
just a little bit more I feel like this
one's more evening appropriate and
obviously the floral one you could wear
and evening but I probably wear that in
a day time as well so no I want to go so
and then last but not least
and absolutely fell in love because I'm
loving top soon
jumpers intimated that have like a
choker like sewn in like built into the
top of that make sense so this is just a
cream sweater and it's just like a
v-neck again like I said a lot of good
v-neck and it's just got a sort of
knitted choke at the part which I really
love I have a jumper that looks like
this as well and wear all the time like
I'm a little bit it's a good wife as
well because um you can obviously hook
it into jeans and whatnot and I just
feel like it will look really good with
a pair of jeans or with the wide leg
trousers anything like that I feel like
this is a little bit more I wouldn't say
Jesse but I probably only wear it with
like jeans in the daytime and then like
trousers in the evening if you're not
mean but yes that is pretty much it that
is everything I have from Isolite birth
I honestly couldn't wait to try all this
on I'm not doing the try um quick chat
like sometimes I'll do transits first so
that I can chat about them and then
other times I'll do them after and I
feel like I'm also excited when I do not
have to accept what should start and
tried about all the clothes but yeah I
really hope you all enjoyed this video

saw its eyes for taken up by visa I'm so
