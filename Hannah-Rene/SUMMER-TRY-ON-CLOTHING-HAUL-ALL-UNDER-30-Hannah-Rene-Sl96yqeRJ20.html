I hope you're having a lovely Sunday and a lovely weekend
so today's video is going to be a summer try on clothing haul because you guys know my favourite videos to film are hauls like I'm
just
obsessed. I'm
obsessed with shopping for clothes online and I feel like you're gonna be a little shocked
Ok, because I'm really trying to step out of my comfort zone this year and have some more like colourful
patterned
Situations on the go. I'm also making an effort to kind of shop on a budget as much as possible this summer
I really want to do my summer wardrobe on a budget
So all of these pieces are under 30 pounds, which is amazing
This video is actually in collaboration with its Shoptagr as well
which I'm so excited about because Shoptagr is an app that I've been using a lot recently to help save me a
Little bit money save me a bit of coin, you know how it is
I'm the sort of person, because I shop so much I try to be as smart as possible when I am shopping
Like I'll always wait for discount codes. I love shopping sales. I love using Charlie's unidays. Ok, he's still a student
It comes in handy
so that is where shoptagr comes in super handy because the way it works is you can basically save
products to your Shoptagr account
so whether it be clothing pieces, makeup
Whatever and you can basically choose to be notified when there is a price reduction
Or there's a sale on that item and the price has been reduced so you can effectively save a little bit money
we all love that. It is a free app as well. So it's a completely free service
You can download it on your phone. You can download it on your desktop. I use mine mostly on Google Chrome
So you basically just sign up and then you have to download the Shoptagr button
which is again completely free and it literally just pops straight into the top of your
desktop where the rest of your bookmarks are and that's pretty much it in terms of
Installing it you just have to sign up and install the button and then you can just go ahead and shop online
so for example
I use this a lot on missguided when I'm shopping through the peace and love section because you guys know I love missguided
Not that there's any in this haul. Because it's a little bit more expensive
I like to wait for when there's discounts and offers and when things go into sale and stuff like that
Just go to the item on the page and then you click the Shoptagr button at the top and you can basically
Choose how and when you want to be notified
So you select the size of the piece of clothing or if it's makeup then you might want to select the shade
Then you can select at what point you get notified
So whether it be if there's just a general price reduction
Which is what I tend to do and you can also select to be notified if something ends up being
25% off 50% off things like that
One thing that I love as well is you can organize all of your products into lists
So I do use this for fashion, but I also use it for makeup because again debenhams for example is really good
They sometimes have 10% off and like little sales on makeup and things like that
So I basically have two lists on my Shoptagr account
I have all of the clothes that I have saved and then all of the makeup as well
It's really handy because you don't have to go back and check for when stuff's like on sale
You just get notified as soon as it is
And you can basically choose what type of notifications you get as well whether it be email mobile things like that
So I'm gonna leave a link down below if you're interested in using the app yourself as I said
It's a super handy app
If you're someone like me who shops a lot, or maybe you don't shop a lot
But you just still like to save a bit of money. It'd be good for designers stuff as well
Say things are a little bit more expensive and you don't really want to pay like that much money for a product it would be
Really handy for that as well. Anyway, I'm just gonna get cracking
So without further a do as I said, everything is from ASOS and everything is under 30 pounds
So this is ASOS own brand, I believe. Yes. So this is just a playsuit. I
Love yellow at the minute. Like I just absolutely love pops of yellow
So when I saw this, I just thought it was super super cute. Yeah. It's a playsuit
The shorts are super flowy
which I absolutely
love and then it actually has a cutout in the middle here which again I love because it's not too big of a cutout where
It shows a lot of flesh, but it just adds a little bit of detail
And the actual neckline is really cute as well
it's just like straight across and then it comes down a little bit under the
Arms, and it does have a zip at the back to help get it on and the overall fit
I'm just in love. So well what size did I get this in?
So I got this in an 8 I feel like it fits really true to size because I'm kind of like an 8 to 10
for me
This is 10 out of 10 a holiday piece with like a pair of sandals or a pair of trainers
Or even in Manchester on a sunny day because let's be honest Manchester has been pretty hot recently and I've been impressed
So right this one's a little bit crazy for me
I don't know if I love this or not so this is another playsuit
playsuits are just like staples for me in summer
Because I just feel like they're really comfy on
There are full outfit in one like you literally put it on and it's done your legs are out
But it's short so you don't have to worry about flashing anyone which you know, we're not about that life
No one wants to see my vajayjay. So this is actually from River Island. But again, it was on asos
This was 28 pounds and I got it in a size 8. 28 pounds from River Island, I feel like it's really good!
So I can't tell if I love this or if it's just a bit too much
I feel like on holiday, because I'm actually going to Marbella the first week of July which I am so excited about I
Feel like this might be quite cute for then. It is very in-your-face
I feel like because the pattern is quite in-your-face and then the tassels are as well. And then it's also got
Kind of like, I don't even know what this part is
But it's like shimmery when it hits the light. It's a halter neck, and it's quite plunge
Which I'm not too mad about because the fit of it is really nice. So it doesn't feel too revealing
There's no zip or anything. It's just elastic at the back. I feel like I love it, but it's definitely a holiday piece
Like I wouldn't wear this hair. I feel like a night out in Marbella
Maybe this could be a thing. I am absolutely
Obsessed with this, this is by I think this is river island again. Yeah actually is river island
I'm obsessed with RI at the minute like I went into store not so long ago and I was just in love with so many of
the pieces. So this believe it or not is actually a bikini top, but when I saw it on the website
Instantly just thought it would be like the coolest bralette ever. So it does come with straps
It comes was really like thick black chunky straps, which you can just attach really easily
Which is what I did because I feel like it looks better without the straps.
It's like netting all over and it's got a really big zip in the middle
Which I love it's like a big ring zip and then it's got little cutouts at the back
you can kind of tell there on the back that it is a bikini because of the sort of
swimsuit material but I feel like at the front you can't really tell and I tried this on and instantly I feel like this would
Just look so good with a pair of like ripped jeans or a pair of wide leg trousers
For a night out. On to something that is completely different to that black bikini bra situation
this is like the opposite. So this I actually
Really love I looked at it on the website and I loved all of the detail on it. It's just a little cami top
It is classed as petite so I got a 10 because I'm not a petite girl
But to be honest because it's a top
I feel like you could just get your normal sizing this even if you not petite and it would be absolutely fine. It has a zip
at the side which I
Appreciate because I feel like some cami tops can be really difficult to like get on over your head and over your shoulders
I don't know if it's just me. Maybe I have wide shoulders. I don't know but I love the detail on this
I love the neckline. It's kind of all at lace at the top and then it's all embroidered at the bottom
It's just got flowers all over it
And I feel like all of the colours complement each other really well
Pink isn't something I would usually go for like I wouldn't usually choose
to wear pink
but I feel like with a tan and in the summer like this is just the cutest little thing with a pair of jeans or
shorts or
I don't know. I just I love it
Okay, I got a pair of sliders, which I haven't actually got out yet because I didn't try them out on camera
I feel like I'll just whack one on now to see if they fit. They're just like simple sliders with two black straps over. Let
Me just try these on and see if they actually like oh
They're a bit. Oh, they're very tight
No, that's not going over my foot. Okay, right. Okay. They were too tight for me. The annoying thing is
These are actually part of like the wide fit range because if anyone has watched my previous hauls you
Will know that I have
Wide feet problem, okay
I cannot buy normal heels and they just fit or like normal sandals
Like I have to get wide fit or go a size up because they just do not fit my fat feet
I do always love. Yes. These are a size 4 wide which is what my normal shoe size is
And I absolutely love the fact that on Asos they have a whole like wide feet, wide foot, wide
Fit that's the one I was looking for. They have like a wide fit section
So you can literally just type in on the search bar like wide fit shoes and it will come up with all of the wide
Fit options that they have
I have a pair of heels from ASOS that are wide fit that again are ASOS own brand that I'm obsessed with.
Absolutely love, they do them in a bunch of different colours. I actually showed them in my previous haul
So I'll leave it on the screen here if you're interested
so be honest, I was just on the hunt for like some sandals for holiday because I took my
This is a sad story. I took my fenty sliders. Not my black furry ones
But I took like my tan ones that they she brought out with like the fenty University collection
I took them to Santorini and I left them in the boot of the hire car
Which I am so sad about I didn't realize until I got home and then I rung them
Being like please leave send me my sandals back and they were like, yeah sure
We'll call you back later, and they never rang so someone in Santorini right now has my fenty Puma sliders that were like 60 pounds
Thanks so much. Okay onto another cami top
I just love tops like this for like jeans and everyday wear I think in summer
They're just so easy to just put on and go
This one is sad because I love the vibe of this like I love the style
It's kind of all
Peplum at the bottom and it's got little like yellow and blue flowers down at them like the two sides
But it's just the fit like the actual neckline,
I feel like you'll see when I try on or maybe it's just me being weird about it
But I feel like the actual neckline is just not quite right don't know if it's because it needs an iron. It doesn't have adjustable
Straps because it actually crosses over at the back so the straps cross over but there's just something about it
That's not quite fitted, right?
I feel like it's probably because with tops like this
I like to wear them quite high up
Like if it's got a higher neckline
I like it to be high when I pulled it down like it looked better
But I feel like it didn't look right on my body
I don't know if it's just me being weird, but there was something about the neckline that just didn't quite do it for me
so
I don't know tell me in the comments because I'm kind of umming and arring like I don't know whether to keep it and just
Try and iron it out a bit or just to send it back. I got two
Dresses, what are these calls?
They're called like Sun dresses. I think on ASOS so these are both by ASOS own brand because I actually have another
Dress like this from ASOS that I've shown in a previous haul
I think it might be like my last haul actually
It was like the little white dress that had all rows of flowers going down like blue red and yellow flowers
And I took it Santorini absolutely loved it
I've just posted a photo in it so I'll insert it here if you don't know which one I'm talking about
But I loved it like it was really affordable again
It was like one of these that was under 30 pounds, really affordable, really comfy and just really light weight for summer
Which I love. So the first one I got.. both of these have fruits on
Which is so funny because I didn't actually realize until they got here that they both have fruits all over
So the first one is white and it's got strawberries
Strawberries. The fit of them is very different I will say so they are quite different dresses. Both mini dresses
So this one has little adjustable straps which again I love and then it kind of ties up in at the centre here across
Boobies, and then it's got zip at the back and it just goes down kind of in like a straight
Style, but then it kind of flares out a little bit the bottom
So it's a little bit kind of peplum at the bottom. The length of this one
I really like because it's not too short but not too long
The only thing I'm a little bit sad about with this is I found that it was very see-through
Yeah, I just think the white because it is like a sundress and it's quite thin
um
it just is a little bit see-through which is strange because the other one that I got, it's a different material to this and
This one's a lot softer, but the one that I have from like the last haul, I'm pretty sure it's not see-through
I've worn it out so it better not be see-through and but as far as I know that one it wasn't see-through
I think me ah
Did you see that? I actually just flipped myself in the eye with a strap. Oh my god, but actually really hurt
Anyway, what was I saying? Oh my gosh
I'm literally sat moaning about this dress and it's actually just attacked me.
Yeah, I think the other ones got like double layers
Maybe that's why it's not see-through. But no I think maybe with nude underwear
It might be okay, but I do think it's a really cute dress nonetheless.
Okay. So this little guy.. that one was white with strawberries and now we've got one that's black with watermelons
So this I don't think I love okay, so it's annoying because I actually love like the vibe of it. I love watermelon
It's my favourite fruit. I love the fact that it's got these little tassels on the end
It kind of adds a little bit more detail. It's just like under the arms
I think, I don't know what it is about this
It's just very tight on the top half which is strange because this is the exact same
style as the previous white one that I've had, the way the top is kind of like
High-necked and straight and stuff like that, but this one feels really tight on
I don't know if it's because these straps are maybe done a little bit too tight
This one's a bit shorter something to bare in mind as well. I feel like both of these were about
20 pounds I want to say. This one is better see-through wise obviously because it's black you cannot see through it at all
Which you know, thank you. I mean it's cute. I feel like it needs a bit of an iron, but it is cute
Tell me which one you prefer in the comments
do you prefer the watermelons or the
Strawberries. Last but not least this feels like I've been speaking for so long
Even though there's only been about 10 piece. This actually started with the skirt
So I clicked on the skirt and wanted the skirt
But then I saw the full outfit that the model had on in the photo and I loved the entire vibe
This again is asos own brand which I think is really cute
A lot of this is actually asos to be honest. It is denim. This just doesn't go over my bottom
Story my life, doesn't fit over my bum at all
It's a size 8 which I usually am in skirts and shorts and stuff like that
But it just would not go over my hips
It's such a shame because I love
like it's got these little cutouts at the front that I could just tell would look so cute on and I love the fact that
It's white like I've been on the hunt for a white skirt for ages. It's just
Sad that it doesn't fit. I'm gonna try and get it in a 10
But I just know.. I'm not even gonna bother actually because I just know it will be too big on the waist if I manage
To get it over my hips. This is the shirt that was in the photo as well
I'll actually put a picture here of the full outfit on the model because I can't try on the full outfit
The skirt didn't fit. So this is the shirt.. this to be fair
I actually might keep anyway
because I
Styled it and like tied it in a little knot and just like had it a little bit more cropped and I actually really liked
It so I feel like I might try it on
With a pair of jeans or something like that and it's literally just like a white
Pinstripe shirt with like blue stripes all the way down
this the.. bleh bleh bleh
I did find that this was a little bit tight on so it's definitely more of like a fitted shirt
Which I'm not mad about because usually when I get shirts
They're kind of like this and they're just a little bit like baggy and oversized and whatever else. I actually quite like this
I don't know what I'd wear it with maybe
white jeans or just normal jeans
I don't know. It's not because it's like white and blue. I feel like it could only really be worn with denim
But yeah, that is absolutely everything. I've ended up sitting to one side. I don't know how that's happened
That is all the clothes
I feel like I really thought this was going to be a short haul because I only got about 10 pieces
But I've been speaking for 40 minutes, so it can't have been that short
I really hope you all enjoyed this video
as I said
I will leave a link to Shoptagr down below if you're interested in using it to help save a little bit money
Honestly comes in so handy, like I said from missguided and pretty little thing and stuff
I feel like they always just sneak in sales
Randomly or like 50% off and no one knows so you will be the first to notified if you have items saved
Which is really handy because stuff just like sells out so quickly. Yeah, just love it
So thank you so much to Shoptagr for sponsoring this video and thank you if you still watching to this point, but yeah
I'm gonna go. Thank you so much for watching as always
I love you guys to the moon and back and I'll see you in the next one and I hope you like the new setup
Let me know. But yeah, bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
