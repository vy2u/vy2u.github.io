going to be a storytime get ready with
me because I'm in the mood to have a
sit-down in a chat do you know what I
mean well seem to really enjoy the first
one that I did which was about my time
at mark when I used to work at Mark I'll
pop it on the screen here if you've not
already seen it but this again has been
at something that's like kind of like
really requested or I got a lot of
questions about I guess we're gonna be
having a chat about like body image and
kind of like how I I don't want to say
stay in shape because I'm not in shape
I'm not gonna lie I don't really know
what to call this and I don't really
know that causa introduced it's it's a
it's a bit of like a broad topic I got a
lot of questions about like how I stay
in shape if you want to call it that or
how I stay positive about my buddy and
things like that and how I but you know
just like what ie what I do for exercise
if I do any exercise at all things like
that so I thought I'd just do a sit down
get ready with me which is kind of gonna
be a storytime in some parts but kind of
just like an overall chat about what
I've learned and like my thoughts on
things on tips and tricks I guess kind
of just like a mixed bag of things I
don't really know obviously I just wanna
say as well disclaimer I'm not like
throughout this video I'm not trying to
say that people like you guys should be
like me or you should be a certain way
in terms of your body obviously like
that's not what this video is about it's
kind of just a chat about myself and
what I've learned as I've grown up and
obviously you know feel free to let me
know in the comments your story or any
tips you've got on how you stay positive
and you know any of your stories if you
feel comfortable sharing them because I
would love to know obviously when we do
makeup at the same time so we should
probably start I'm just gonna voice ties
with my Sunday Riley CEO moisturiser I'm
actually going to the cinema later with
ila I'm going to see the greatest
showmen so excited because I'm not
seeing it and I've seen all the hype on
Twitter and things so I'm just gonna do
a light glam do you not mean well yeah
so one thing that I get asked about a
lot is how I stay fit I don't even say
fit because for some reason I feel like
some of you guys think that I'm really
in shape and I work out a lot and stuff
like that I honestly don't I wish I did
you guess in a sense I do maintain this
size and the shape I own which obviously
I just want to say like I'm not seeing
my size in my shape is the correct way
to be yeah I got um a lot of questions
about like
whyyy if I exercise which I don't do
which I exercise more it's something
that I do want to get into this year
just being fitter and more active like
not even necessarily working out a lot
but just me being more active and like
walking more and just doing more like
basic forms of exercise which everyone
can do I can't remember the last time I
went to a gym the last time I went to a
gym was about a year ago and the last
time I did like a full-blown workout was
like at least half a year ago I'm not
even gonna lie across the screen just
complete laziness which is what my mom
will say it is and I'm you know it is
like a cross between laziness and then
other things that I'll get into
throughout the video I'm just gonna go
in with the rodeo dragons and blood I
shall I've not tried this yet but I've
heard really good stuff about this range
so I'm excited to give it a go so in
terms of like diet because as I said I
don't tend to exercise a lot at the
minute um so I kind of rely a lot on
like my diet to maintain how I am I'm
not super strict for myself because I
feel like if you're too strict and you
um as you know pay like too much
attention to how many calories something
has and how much fat and blah blah blah
whatever else I feel like if you've
really strict on yourself it doesn't
last like I've tried in the past to kind
of you know go on a diet where you eat
so many calories or whatever else and
you I just you can't stick to it because
it's just not like what's the word it's
just not realistic in a sense obviously
have you the sort of person who goes to
the gym everyday and you want to stick
to like a really strict regime and
things like that and that's absolutely
amazing but for like the average person
I just don't think it's super realistic
so like I do try and eat a balanced diet
like for example I eat I try and eat a
lot of fruit because I absolutely love
through those of you who have followed
me like a few like for a couple of
months or since last year you'll know
that I did kind of get in to eat in
plant-based so that basically means for
people who don't know what plant-based
means it basically means that you don't
eat any animal products so you just
stick to you like fruit veg you can have
breads and stuff as long as they don't
contain any animal products you
basically just can't eat any dairy any
meat and fish any eggs anything that
comes from an animal cannot be consumed
to it for like a good two months and
then we kind of like we had the kitchen
done and we only had a microwave to make
food and trying to be a plant base with
just a microwave is like so hard it's
just it's just not doable unless you
kind of go out and eat as well if you
just like eat cold salads and things
like there's not really a lot you can do
with a microwave I mean there's some
things but you know for it to last I've
got two months once the kitchen was
being done it which is not realistic so
I haven't really like fully stocked to
it in the sense that I had bits of like
chicky that had bits of fish I've had
dairy
struktur not eating red meat because one
thing I really noticed when I was plug
mace or vegan I don't like to call it
vegan because everyone gets really like
rutting in the comments because like I'm
not vegan in other aspects of my life
and technically just plant-based but you
know I mean but yeah I stopped to not
eat and bread me even though I've had
like bits of chicken and fish and stuff
right to me it was one thing that I
really know it is made a difference in
my body and how I felt and stuff there's
just something about it that I feel like
I just feel like we're not meant to
digest it obviously we will eat it and I
used to have a lot of like sausage and
burgers like beef burgers and things
like that and it's it's fine but I just
feel like there's something about it
your body she's not meant to digest it
chicken and stuff I don't know it's as
much and like fish I don't know it's
either but when I used to eat red meat
like how to get the worst cramps
afterwards and I should know it just
made me feel like so that's one
thing that I've stopped to not eat in I
never eat any red meat overall though
being vegan and I do want to get back
into it properly like fully committed to
it because I'm I did know it's like such
a difference in my body and how I fell
and things like that like I was way less
blow aired it was crazy because it's
like I stuck to it properly for about
two months I'd say and like I could eat
endless amounts of live in a sense
like I used to have pizza with no cheese
on it so it literally just be like the
base and the tomorrow and then I'd get
loads of toppings on it so it was still
kind of tasty and stuff and that like a
piece is not a healthy thing do you know
I mean but I still never felt bloated
afterwards but I never felt like I'd
eaten something really bad because it
didn't have the cheese on it like it's
crazy how dare
he's like so fattening in a way and I
did really enjoy like the two months of
just feeling it I just felt clean I
might explain it like my body just felt
really clean but yeah I kind of want to
get back into it and then maybe do some
like recipes or kind of whyyy in a day
and things like that because I didn't
even necessarily do it to lose weight it
was just kind of to feel healthier and
just like the ethical reasons as well
because obviously you know it's not good
to eat me it's crazy as well because
even though I wasn't trying to lose
weight like I still a like I said pizzas
while still he I had a lot of corn vegan
stuff corner vegan chicken nuggets and
the best things ever they taste so good
I still eat them now
kuan vegan fish fingers with that green
badge and peas I love peas even though I
was still eating so much stuff I in the
mornings I'd have either through already
have Weetabix with oatmeal and then for
lunch I'd have you know something with
like breads or pasta you could still
have pasta of course as long as it
doesn't contain any eggs jacket potatoes
stir fries like there's so much you can
eat that you just you just have to
switch like a couple of ingredients out
and it's you know it's fine it's
plant-based even though it's like I said
I was eating it so much food I lost
weight because every now and then I'll
weigh myself and I remember getting on
the scales like a couple of weeks in or
whatever and I drop like a good few
kilos and I was like what the hell it
was so weird because I you know still
eating a lot of food but I guess cuz
it's just healthier for your body and
stuff you know
I just lost weight I don't know just
gonna go in with some concealer just to
prime my eyelids I don't know if this is
gonna be a bit dark oh no it should be
okay anyone as well who sat here
thinking I couldn't have a be
plant-based like AI loads on me and
stuff like that it's something that you
can try even just say one day a week or
two days a week like it still makes
difference not something that you have
to like 100% stick to you and a hundred
cent you know be super strict on but it
you know every little part helps for
example like one one thing that is hard
is eating out like it's quite hard to
eat in restaurants sometimes because not
every single restaurant has a full range
of like vegan options Italian restaurant
C's are usually quite good like Pizza
Express and zzs were quite good for say
for example you did a six day
to be in plant-based and then one day
where you didn't all the other way
around like you did six days I've eaten
regularly and one day of eat and plump
eight it's like all of it helps and it's
just you know switches let me diet a
little bit and it kind of helps you
buddy
you know just process stuff differently
other than that the one thing that I
will say which is really important is to
drink a lot of water I've been bad for
this recently I'm trying to get back
into it even just squash like I drink
two of these a day just like squash
because I'm not gonna lie like I hate
the taste of water I just hate the way
water tastes like it's just so boring
but water makes such a big difference to
the way you eat as well because one
thing that I noticed when I don't drink
a lot of water is I tend to overeat a
lot because something that your body
does quite often is say if you feeling
really hungry you'll actually just be
thirsty and you'll just need water but
your body can't recognize the difference
between like being hungry and mean
thirsty if you're not I mean I know it
just sounds like one of those things
that people just say like you need to
drink more water
another reason is well why it's like
super important is because it does help
to kind of produce say if you get
bloated a lot like I sometimes get
really bloated a lot of the time it'll
just be because you know you've not
drunk enough what enough water
how many times can I say water like come
on really it tries to like retain the
water that you have in your body because
you know it's not getting any new source
of water so it just tries to like hold
onto the water that your body's already
got and that a lot of the time is what
makes you so bloated because of like
water retention no the easiest way to
solve that and the only way to like fix
it and to make you feel less bloated is
to just drink some water because then
your body won't retain as much water
because it thinks you know it knows it's
got a supply coming in if that makes
sense I don't know if I'm explaining
that right pay attention to what makes a
difference like whatever you feeling
bloated think you know what's made me
feel like that what about eating because
you know a lot of the time as well we'll
have like really small in tolerances to
stuff so just test the waters and just
you know try different foods try
different foods without certain
ingredients like dairy free and gluten
free and just a little ahead like what
works for you okay I'm gonna go on to
eyes I'm gonna use the naked heat I've
still not tried this yet because I
really wanted to save it for a first
impressions I think I think what I've
learned for mice
was just not over e because that was one
thing that was really like I had one
summer where I just like completely
ruined my body it was a combination of
over Ian and drinking alcohol alcohol
again is something you don't realize
like how damaging it is for your body
it's so bad like no joke when I went to
xiongtai so I went to Sun tea with Rosie
and Dell and I I just I was just about
to turn 18 um and I came back and I had
put on like a full stone and a half or
something in 14 days
and that was simply due to cocktails
like cocktails with fruit juice and
alcohol and eating pizza I no joke I put
on so much weight it was crazy and I
know it's not what people want to hear
when they're like 18 19 20 whatever I
don't drink anywhere near as much
alcohol now cuz I don't go out as much
but when I used to go out a lot like I
had a phase when I was 18 my Youssou got
all the time and I don't really like the
taste of alcohol so I used to just drink
cocktail I still really like mostly
drink cocktails now because fruit juice
is sweet but the fruit juice is what
kills you because it's got so much sugar
in it's crazy it's my 18th birthday and
I bought a dress from myself where I
used to wear and like I'd bought it only
a couple of weeks before like a couple
of weeks before I went to long T or
whatever because it was you know it was
fresh like new item in the shop it was
like a denim dress with like blue
flowers on it things and I didn't
realize how bad it was until I got to my
18th birthday a couple of days after I
got back and I really really struggled
to get it on I was like wow and just
kind of like talking you through what
I've learned and like what I've learned
kind of affects my way and you know
stuff like that obviously I'm not saying
you shouldn't do any of these things
like you shouldn't drink cocktails I
still drink cocktails but I don't regret
any of it I don't regret a single thing
like that was one of the best holidays
I've ever been on in my entire life I
had so much fun and that summer I
remember like I just went through a
phase of even though I wanted to kind of
go back to how my body was and because I
was just so down and stuff I just
resorted to food so I would just come to
eat quite like a vicious cycle um and I
feel like it's something that people go
through a lot like completing is just
such an easy thing to do ya know I just
try and maintain
a well-balanced diet I guess I try to
eat veg I trying to eat through I don't
eat tons of it I should eat more of it I
have treats I have takeaways but you
know I just try not to like think too
much into it because it's like as long
as you're happy in your own skin and as
long as you can accept who you are and
accept the way you are you know that's
that's what's important I guess it
doesn't matter you know what size you
are what you look like it's just more
about accepting who you are if you want
to change something for yourself
absolutely then you know that's fine but
hey lashes are on I don't know actually
stuck yet these are the Lily lashes
makeup by Samuel I believe okay so yeah
in terms of like exercise exercises
something that I've always like
struggled with and not like struggled
with because I don't want to like make
excuses but it's something that I'm just
quite funny about yeah like I was saying
when I had my personal trainer things
like weights and stuff was absolutely
fine but as soon as we tried like one
time to do cardio and I just got on the
treadmill and stuff and he really tried
to push me to like carry on going as a
personal trainer would and shoot him but
I get so worked up it's basically like
stems back to when I was in primary
school because when I was in primary
school and kind of like years four and
five I would say which if anyone doesn't
know what primary school is sorry I'm
just trying to make sure these lashes
like dry and don't make my eyes water
because otherwise we're gonna have
issues yeah if anyone doesn't know what
primary school is say like if you from a
different country or whatever um yes
four and five I kind of like when you're
about eight or nine nine or ten I know
ten ten eleven about 10-ish it was
really weird like when I was in primary
school I had a group of friends and
there was like four of us like four
girls including me eyes you know we were
friends for like a couple of years I
would say there's one girl in particular
that I'm still friends with now who I
was friends with for a lot longer than
the other two um but basically like we
were friends and stuff I mean part my
friend group and then it got to like
year for got to like year for in this
one girl started like really picking on
me and
just like bullying me and stuff I mean
it was kind of just to do is like I
don't know I guess she just thought I
was chubby you know as you are when you
like ten or whatever yeah she used to
like pick on me for being like choppy
and stuff and being like the chubby Awan
if like the four of them and you know
stuff like that I'm gonna go in with the
LA girl Pro conceal in the shade natural
I got a different shade of this cuz
other one was too dark so I'm hoping
this one is gonna be a better I don't
know the thought of being picked on when
you like so young for how you look is
just mind-blowing like when I think back
to it I mean it's ridiculous to like
make fun of anyone at any age but I'm
just like when you're that young and you
still grow in her stuff and your body's
like not even fully developed anyway
like I just think back to it and think
like what the oh yeah this girl was
like super mean to me and it kind of
just started out as like she just picked
on me for being a bit chubby or whatever
like at lunch time so when it's kind of
lunchtime and you play or whatever and
spend time with your friends and stuff
she'd she was so horrible like she would
say to me you need to spend lunchtime
doing athletics and running around the
playground because you need to be
skinnier sort of thing it makes me like
really nervous to talk about because
it's like still affects me too like this
day if you not I mean not in the sense
that it bothers me but in terms of like
working out and stop it yes it's hard to
explain but when I was younger
especially this match is so much better
I thank the Lord when I was younger
especially I was like so bad at sticking
up for myself I could never stick up for
myself I didn't like alguna people I
didn't like confrontation you know I
just didn't like I couldn't stand my own
ground with anything even like when I
got to high school and I had like I had
a boyfriend who was just such an ass to
me like I could just never stand my
ground really until I got like older I
guess yeah anyway every single lunch
time she basically say like Hannah you
need to start running around the
playground you need to get your
exercising because you want to lose
weight sort of thing so I would spend
the entire lunchtime even though I
didn't want to I didn't want to spend
lunch time running around in junior high
takes like that wasn't my idea of fun
I'd do it anyway because she was so
nasty about it and I'd you know trying
to have breaks and stuff because I get
super out of breath and she'd be like
you know you need to keep going you keep
going so I carry on running and stuff
and it kind of developed into like an
anxiety thing I used to get really bad
anxiety about lunchtime
and thinking that I'd have to do
athletics and stuff for lunch because I
just didn't want to do it and you know I
didn't want her shouting at me or her
bullying me or you know like that
but yeah I usually got this prophet like
it basically developed into an anxiety
about doing athletics and doing run in
and it's still it's crazy like when
you're younger when you're younger and
you still learn in and develop in it's
crazy how much something can have an
impact on like the rest of your life
because I'm 20 now and I could not like
go to a gym and run on a treadmill in
front of people just the same that when
I had a personal trainer and he was
pushing me to keep running on the
treadmill I couldn't do it I was like
you need stock because I'm gonna have a
panic attack
I can't do it that's the point where I
just didn't want to go into school you
know I remember like one day really
vividly because we used to live in a
house we didn't used to live in this
house when I was in primary school I
used to live in a different house and
our house was basically backed onto the
school so you basically walked out of
our back door out of the garden and our
primary school was there so me and
Charlie like we didn't need walk-in
school by like our parents as such they
just opened the door and we just go to
school if you know if I remember one
morning like my mom so my mom would just
go to work or whatever she didn't have
to like you know stay around for us to
wait to go to school or whatever and we
were in the hallway and she was like you
know I'm going to work now ba ba ba I'm
getting like I was out and I don't want
it's one of those memories it's like so
vivid vivid in your mind that you can
just still remember like the feeling and
like how you fell I feel like when
you're younger especially like you don't
want to tell your parents you don't want
to like snitch on someone's you know
what I mean you don't want your parents
to go into school and have to speak to
the teachers like it's just embarrassing
which it shouldn't be but that's like
how you feel when you like really young
so I bottled it up for ages because this
was going on for ages and ages and this
girl just continued to be really
horrible to me and you know eventually
like just broke down in tears one
morning told mom what was going on and
obviously like my mom being my mom she
was like straight into school like few
min like that someone it made me feel
this way and obviously just like went
straight to the teachers and stuff and
got it all sorted and you know obviously
it did resolve there I feel like
you think as a kid like if your parents
go to teachers and things it's gonna get
worse I know I like cried that off you
know a lot resolved it in things and
from that day forward she never picked
on me again
and eventually she kind of just like
left the school and stuff and moved away
which thank God oh yeah she was a nasty
piece of work and it's crazy like how
something that's happened so long ago
now is because it happened when I was so
young and it was just like drilled into
me when I was so young like it still
affects how I feel about things now like
I remember when I got to high school and
I'm obviously at this point I was
absolutely fine like you know didn't
bother me anymore like didn't bother me
watch used to say to me or anything like
that but when I got to high school and
we did like PE and stuff I used to do
like I used to hate athletics like
anything that involved running like
running around a track because it's like
there's just like I just associate this
feeling with it and like how I felt when
I used to do it I can't explain it this
is why I don't talk about it because
it's really hard to explain and I feel
like people won't get it obviously I
want to share it because I want you guys
to know that like I want you guys to
hear things that I've struggled with so
that if there's anything you struggle
with you feel better about it you feel
like you're not on your own do you know
what makes you not like people go
through this or yes I just wanted
to like share that with you so it kind
of has a bit of a back story as to why I
struggle with things like cardio I mean
I can do it by myself and luckily we
actually have a treadmill at the house
I'm I can absolutely go running and
stuff and do running on the treadmill by
myself but as soon as it's in front of
other people
there's just something about it that
like my my mind is just like no like no
it got to high school and things and I
used to hate athletics like rounders and
stuff absolutely you know and I didn't
love because I'm not like super sporty
or anything but I enjoyed doing it and I
would do it but when it got to summer I
would do athletics I was just like or do
anything to get out of rhodium because
it just made me feel so anxious I'll
just ruined all that I've like cried on
this lush as well so it's like ruined
the actual eyelash why am i such a mess
I don't know honestly like when you're
in high school and college you don't a
pre oniony obvious I didn't go to uni
but when you're in high school in
college and so if you don't appreciate
like how act if you are not of walking I
used to do that then just got taken away
as soon as I got a car which by the way
I'm not complain
about having a car of course like a it's
so convenient having a car but it's like
you need to kind of make up for that
lack of you know walking and stuff that
you do and I just didn't do that when I
got back to like having a personal
trainer and go into the gym and things
but because I have like so I don't it's
like I have such an anxiety when it
comes to like cardio and exercise takes
me ages just to like pluck up the nerve
to like do it used to do horse riding as
well so when I was in like high school I
used to go to riding school near mine
which was another way I catch like
active effects I used to love horse
riding I love horses I love animals um
and again like one lesson I probably
been doing it about a year and a half
maybe and I used to go to great lessons
every week on the same day absolutely
loved it
it was never something I was going to do
like you know super professional or
whatever but it was just like a really
nice hobby remember one day one lesson
it was a group lesson and I was on a new
I was on a new horse and it was just
being stupid difficult like it was a
jumping lesson so it wasn't just like a
basic flat lesson or whatever I feel
like lost my powder brush I don't know
where it's gone this horse was just
having no nevere absolutely none of it
and um the person who was like leading
the lesson or whatever was like oh no
come on you really need to like get this
saw aid like getting over these fences
bah bah bah bah bah I'm like I got
myself into that state again like I
don't know how it happened it just came
over me where I just like had a
full-blown panic attack in the middle of
the lesson and oh god I hate thinking
about again it just makes me feel really
uncomfortable to think about but it just
sucks because I really enjoyed horse
riding and like after that lesson like I
couldn't go back because I just fell I
just I just felt like I could in like my
in my mind I just couldn't go back and
so I wish I just like plucked up the
courage and gone back I suppose I still
kind of I want to but I wish I just you
know plucked up the courage and come
back because that's something that I
used to really enjoy him really loved
but it was like a similar sort of thing
like I was just feeling like super under
pressures to do something and I felt
like I couldn't do it and I was like I
just had a full-blown panic attack like
it was awful I'm
was that thank God my mom used to come
and watch pretty much all of my lessons
so she was and we just like got in the
car afterwards I was just like wow wow
but again like horse riding was such a
good way to keep fixed you don't realize
like how oh how much like stamina and
just fit in it like you need a good
level of fitness so I do it just gonna
go in with some bronzer by sila this is
in the shade medium it's a stay all day
yeah the only reason I've kind of like
shared that is just so like you guys
know because once I feel like you guys
are always super sweet and you always
compliment me and say that I've got
really nice thicker and stuff which you
know thank you so much I really
appreciate so it's just kind of to show
you that like you might think you know
I've got a really nice figure and stuff
or whatever and I seem really healthy
but those things that I really struggle
with as well I think that's kind of what
I want to put across like everyone kind
of has stuff that they struggle with and
stuff that they find difficult so
hopefully just maybe to help you a
little bit if this stuff that you
struggle with but just so that you know
like you know you're not on your own and
even people that you might think you
know really great and look really
healthy and stuff they will still have
things that they find really difficult
and really struggle with that makes
sense hopefully that made sense I feel
like I'm absolutely sweating filming
this video like I'm so just so nervous
talking about this kind of stuff ya know
it's kind of like the back story and
then since last year when I had a
personal trainer I do want to get back
into exercising again because like I
said I just rely on diet mostly in a
minute to kind of keep me in shape and
but I do want to get back into going to
the gym me and Caleb spoke about getting
a gym membership so I think that could
be quite fun because like Kate is
someone that I feel super comfortable
around so that would be like fun
hopefully ya know one other thing that I
do want to speak about which I feel like
some people might have come to this
video just to like chat about this but
it's just kind of like body positivity
and you know just feeling good about
yourself because I think I said this
earlier but that's kind of what not is
it's not it doesn't matter like what
shape or size you are it just matters
how you feel about yourself and you know
making sure that you are doing things
for yourself and not for other
people think like I'm just going in with
the NYX stroke of genius Polly I'm just
gonna use a couple of shades to
highlight um but I think it's like
social media such a big thing now um
it's just so easier to like go online
and just like compare yourself to other
people and you know look at someone's
page and think I want to look like her
or I want her lifestyle not even buddy
wise but like I want her lifestyle she
looks really happy like I want to be
doing this stuff that she's doing it
gets like really hard you please like
you end up putting yourself under a lot
of pressure I think naturally anyway in
life like you are always the biggest
critic of yourself I I find that anyway
I feel like I'm always you know the
biggest critic of me you know those
things that bother me that people won't
even other people will even notice if
that makes sense because I just you know
you see yourself every day you live with
yourself I think it's just about it's
not about trying to be a certain shape
or trying to like look a certain way
it's just about like you know finding
finding things in life that make you
happy and just being happy in your own
skin I think it's something that I
mentioned in like a and I'm Q&amp;amp;A not so
long ago um Victoria in the throws got a
really cool article on how like the
importance of making yourself happy on
social media in the sense of like if
you're following someone say if you're
following an Instagram account and
you're looking at that person thinking
save it's like I'm trying to think of an
example like if you're following for
example like a fitness model or whatever
and you're thinking I want to look like
that like it's fine to kind of use it
for inspiration say if you on a mission
to get fair and you want to you know
have follow certain pages for
inspiration that's absolutely fine but
it's kind of important to take a step
back sometimes and think you know is
this actually like affecting me
positively or mental or negatively I'm
trying to explain this in like the right
way because sometimes I find myself like
even like I find myself on Instagram
scrolling through like the explore page
for example and I think oh gosh she's
absolutely beautiful like you know I
wish I looked something about her like
that or whatever and I just think you
know you shouldn't be comparing yourself
to
so it's a case of just clicking off or
if you follow accounts where you look at
someone and think I wish I look like
that and you kind of its innocence and
it makes you feel bad about yourself you
should just don't follow that page you
think as well it's really important to
kind of be aware of like how much time
you actually spend on socials this is
something I'm trying to do like recently
it cut it's hard because like I don't
want to spend tons of time on social
media like I kind of want to spend time
with family with friends with Kane
whatever doing stuff like that and I
don't want to spend as much time on
social media anymore but at the same
time I want to be on the speaking to you
guys
um and things like that but I think it's
just about finding a healthy balance
because if I know for a fact that if I
sit on Instagram all day or show on
YouTube all day watching like videos of
like you know seeing pictures of like
models and stuff I just end up thinking
 I don't like to admit it but I do
do you know what I mean I mean there's
nothing wrong with me you know I mean
like when I actually think about it like
there's nothing wrong with me why you
like looking at other people comparing
yourself to other people it's just silly
so try and just be aware you know be
aware of what if things are affecting
your mental health
if something's affecting you negatively
just stop looking at it I always think
this like when people leave share your
comments on videos for example like like
hate comments you're obviously not
enjoying this video so why are you
putting yourself through the time of
watching it it's the same with anything
in life like if you just if something's
having a negative effect on you just
don't involve yourself in it same with
friends if you've got a friend who's
been an absolute prick just cut them out
like at the end of the day it's all just
about you know your own health your own
self-worth like what you know what's
important for you just sitting down and
thinking what actually makes me happy
and what is actually important to me in
my life um I think you know just when
you start being more self-aware of
everything in general that's when you
just start to feel like happy I hope
I've like made sense in this video
because my god I feel like I just tried
 for like the whole thing but
honestly guys I just put yourself first
put your mental like health first you
physical health first you know there's
nothing wrong there's nothing wrong with
that asshole there's nothing wrong with
putting
yourself over other people honestly as
well like talking to people make such a
difference like whether it's your mom
like my moms like my best friend and I
feel so lucky in that sense because you
know I have a mom that super super heir
but I know some people aren't fortunate
enough to have that you know just find
someone that you can rely on and talk to
and not like bottle things away it's
important to share how you're feeling if
you feel in you know down or whatever
don't like bottle it in because if
there's one thing that I've learned in
my life like you know it's important to
just a problem shared is a problem
halved is what I'm trying to say I'm
just using it Rimmel lip liner in spice
I'm not gonna go on top with one of the
Maybelline matte lipsticks this is in
the shade at 98 won a purely nude I've
not tried this one before so I'm really
excited to see what it looks like and
and then depending how I feel I'm gonna
top it off with the Too Faced melted
latex in the shade hopeless romantic
okay so this is the finished look it's
kind of just like I said like a soft
glam and I'm really annoyed like goth I
said it was just gone but I'm gonna try
and fix it what was I saying yeah if
there's anything because I feel like
this video was just doing me like
charting on and rumbling I guess like I
just wanted to share with you some stuff
that I've struggled in my life hopefully
if there's anything you've struggled
with or are currently struggling with
it'll hopefully I don't know just make
you feel like you're not alone and we
all get through things and it's all just
one big journey for all of us you know
just to put yourself first put your own
health first put yourself over other
people it's not a selfish thing to do
it's just you know looking after
yourself take care of yourself don't
spend tons of time on social media like
it sometimes worries me how how much the
internet is taking over life which is
just I know it's a weird thing for me to
say because like my job is the internet
but it sometimes concerns me like how
much time we all spend in on social
media you know don't compare yourself to
other people it's really easy to just
say because you know we all do it it's
just natural but I think it's just yeah
about managing how much time you
actually spend on socials and who you
following you know managing what
actually makes you happy and what
doesn't make you happy and things like
that I love you so much please just be
happy and I don't know there's
anything you want to speak to me about
I'm always here of course best way to
reach me is on Twitter I do read YouTube
comments of course but I feel like
Twitter's easier to charts people um but
yeah I love you guys so much be happy
stay safe of course and I'll speak to
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
