going to be a story time get ready with
me because I never do these on my
channel and I thought would be really
fun it's a film sauce so I thought for
the first one we would do a story time
about when I worked that MUC because I
got so many questions about this from
you guys about like the experience how
it got the job like what the job is like
stuff like that so I thought I would
just sit down do my makeup and stuff
because I am going out for food with
cane and a bear and just tell you all my
thoughts I'm just going to do like a
really soft ghulam I've been doing a lot
of these lately and I've posted quite a
few pictures on Instagram and you all
really seem to like the makeup so I'm
just going to do something really
similar I've already gone ahead and
popped some Armani prima glow on
moisturizing balm just as a moisturize
that you can use it as a primer as well
but I'm gonna prime as well and I'm just
gonna prime it with the Smashbox photo
finish primer water which it looks like
so if you enjoyed this video please do
give it a massive it thumbs up and let
me know and tell me in the comments if
you want me to do more of these and what
topics and things you want me to talk
about so yeah I work for mark for about
six months I would say so it was two
years ago now because I started off as
ooh Christmas temp in 2014 I worked at
much Harford which I feel like I can say
a lot of you guys know I work there as
well because sometimes like you guys
will come in and say hi and stuff which
I absolutely love like it was so much
fun I worked in Selfridges yes I worked
too much other witches in Selfridges I
before that I was actually working in
Miss Selfridge which is upstairs from
Matt I'm just gonna go in with my pal
fabric by Giorgio Armani both they all
have to do it I actually have to say a
massive thank you to a friend of mine
called Rachel I'll leave a link to her
Instagram it down below Rachel not
Rachel Larry by the way a different
Rachel and Rachel already worked at Mac
she worked at the exchange store I don't
think she works anymore I'm pretty sure
yeah she worked at Manchester Exchange
and she knew that I did makeup and stuff
because obviously I did YouTube and
things at the time and basically at
Christmas time I don't know if they do
this every year but they will usually do
like open interviews because obviously
at Christmas time the store gets really
busy and they tend to have to hire a lot
more staff so the way they do it is
through like open interviews so I don't
have to like bring in a CV or anything
Rachel basically told me
when the open interview was gonna be and
we went together and stuff and I had
like the first initial interview yes my
brush gone all right there was quite a
lot of people that to be interviewed it
was that just like a five-minute thing
if you've got an interview at Mack or
anything like that I'd always recommend
wearing a black like a full black outfit
because that's what you have to wear
encounter and obviously it's good to
have like your makeup done as well so
pretty much just sat down and I can't
remember exactly the questions that the
lady are for it was kind of just just
like what she makeup experience what do
you think you could bring to the team
what do you like about the brand I do
remember asking that I'm pretty sure
like what's your favorite thing about
Mack is a brand obviously it's good to
know
no my like what brand you going for for
like an interview it's good to know like
the background on the brand and they
stuff they do so obviously with Mac we
do a lot of things like buck to mark
where if you taken I think it's six and
empty containers you got like a free
lipstick and things like Viva Glam
they're really passionate about Viva
Glam and stuff like that just a little
tip if you're gonna go for an interview
of course so yeah it was really scary I
was honestly shifting myself because I
really wanted the job I was told was I
at the time so I must have been
seventeen I'm pretty sure I was a
eighteen I'm obviously kind of said at
the end like if you're successful then
we'll call you for like a second I think
he was a second interview or do you just
go straight to no it was just straight
to the makeup task as my memories like a
sieve it's ridiculously yeah I think
that's the most known thing about the
interview process at mark is that you
have to do a makeup test which is
usually half an hour I don't know if it
differs from Mike's daughter's job but
when I had to do mine it was half an
hour and I was basically given a bit of
a brief and stuff and all my products
were ready in things I didn't have to
sanitize anything because they'd already
done that for me it bought sanitization
again at Mac and any makeup counter is a
really big thing foundational just
always looks so good I'm like buffle so
yeah I have my little interview and then
basically got cold I don't remember how
many days after but it was pretty soon
after and then got straight into
basically got booked and stood the
makeup test which oh my gosh I remember
this vividly because like it was so
awkward right
anyone who knows much offered the main
counter is downstairs so when I got
booked into my makeup test I was told
that I'd be doing it on the downstairs
counter which is like normal cats and
stuff because the upstairs one had just
opened got to the day and we actually
ended up doing the makeup test upstairs
opposite my work where I worked at the
time at myself rich barely minor hand
told anyone that I was like in the
process of getting the job I got mark or
anything and I hadn't said anything to
any part I know that particular day at
Miss Selfridge both my managers were in
ok I don't know what they were doing but
both of my managers are in and I was
like oh my god this is an awkward
situation of my life like I just hate it
here that I'm off just like broke me out
into a hot sweat let alone actually
having then to do makeup on someone you
do have to bring a module or like a
friend or whatever I brought Rachel um
who obviously like help me out with the
initial like interview process and stuff
because obviously she works the muck so
she has a lot of inside knowledge of
like I don't know what you should do and
stuff like that I'm just tips and tricks
see how to do a full face in half an
hour you don't have to do eyelashes I
don't know I feel like some stores they
do make you do false eyelashes but for
our test we didn't have to do that and I
remember like what the brief was cuz
it's not like a brief but they kind of
tell you like what sort of look to do oh
no I think it was basically you either
had to do a dramatic eye and a nude lip
or a simple eye and a bold lip so either
like focus on the eyes on the lips I'm
pretty sure yeah we made sure well I
made sure that I asked her skin type and
things like that I asked how she likes
make up in things because obviously if
you were to get the job when customers
in customers in when customers come in
from a quince Joe if you obviously have
to make a point of asking them about the
skin I'm like what kind of makeup they
like and stuff like that so that you
know you're giving them what they want
it was cookie was alright it wasn't the
best like I'm not gonna lie because you
got so nervous and then you have like a
little technical test I believe so you
kind of have I think it's five minutes
to do something technical we had to do a
red lip so we were given a lip liner and
a lipstick and we had to create like the
perfect red lip in like five minutes or
something like that at the time like I
really wasn't confident I wasn't like
that confident with doing like bold lips
and stuff especially like under pressure
in a time frame but I managed to do it
it came up okay and then on each test
and stuff after each thing so after the
30 minutes and then after the technical
thing they did give feedback which was
obviously really nice to know like what
you could have improved on and what they
liked and stuff like that so I'm pretty
sure for my lip she said that she liked
the shape of it but I underlined the
lips a little bit or something like that
like I could have made them a bit more
rounded and a bit more even something
along those lines which was fair enough
because like the makeup definitely
wasn't perfect but just know if you're
going for a makeup test like no matter
what brenda is like they don't
necessarily look for something
absolutely perfect they just look for
like potential if you know I mean and
one thing as well which was a really
good tip that Rachel gave me like the
whole interview process and stuff was to
have a portfolio because I had never
worked in makeup before professionally I
didn't have any qualifications and
makeup you guys know I'm self-taught and
I've never done a makeup cause before
working at Mac I'd never worked on a
makeup counter in my life obviously I
had like retail knowledge and retail
expertise because I'd worked at Miss
Selfridge but I didn't have like that
much of a professional background in
make-up which obviously put me at quite
a disadvantage so one really good tip
that she gave me was to basically put a
portfolio together before I when so I
did a portfolio and I basically did
makeup on my next-door neighbor I stood
on a knee which is on my friend did it
on my aunty Jen but five people or so
and I basically took professional photos
I did all this at home it's at like
professional photos of the makeup and
stuff put them in a portfolio like
printed them out and stuff and I took
that with me to the interview process
and to the makeup test because one thing
that Rachael said was basically like if
you do the makeup and stuff and you feel
like you've not done done a good enough
job obviously if you take if you take
your portfolio so if you can kind of
whip out at the end and be like I know
that I could have improved on the look
and stuff I just want to show you and
some of the makeup that I've done in the
past and things like that so that you
can see what I can do like as a whole if
you know I mean another thing that's
really important as well because
obviously working on a makeup counter
it's kind of like selling products as
well as doing makeup and so make sure
that when you're doing the make window
explain why you use in certain products
and you know what benefit they are for
the customer so when Rachel was sat in
the seat and I was doing a makeup and
stuff I was basically saying like we use
in whatever primer it was because it's
really gonna hydrate your skin and then
we're gonna use this foundation because
I know you like a full coverage blah
blah blah blah blah and just make sure
that you're showing product knowledge as
well what else I think that's the most
important in the makeup - just making
sure you show product knowledge and just
seeming confident even if you're a bit
like me and had no idea what you're
doing and just completely winging it
yeah at the end of the makeup test when
I doing like the lipsticks and the eyes
and all of that jazz and it was pretty
much done and feedback was joining stuff
I did actually get my little pot full
out and say just so you know like these
are some other looks that I've done and
other people just that you can see them
and see other stuff that I can do and
make sure as well when I was putting my
portfolio together that I had a lot of
different looks so on Annie I did like
really dark eyes in a really dark lip I
did something more natural on Jen and my
next-door neighbor I just made sure
there was a lot of different looks and
things in that yeah with makeup in
general um no matter what kind of job
you going for having a portfolio can
really really benefit yes so it's
definitely something that I would
recommend doing because you don't even
have to like like it's something that
you can do yourself if you not mean like
I said I did mine at home yeah I showed
her that and then we just left and
things I literally run away from the
cons I didn't even look at myself Ridge
because I could not look my manager in
the eye after I've done that it was so
awkward she was actually really good
about its beef and my manager at my
Selfridge because she was like she knows
that I do makeup and that I love makeup
and stuff and I remember when I went in
for my shift like a couple of days later
and she was like oh we were trying to
like get your attention and wish you
good luck and stuff and I was like oh so
cute but no they were really good about
X they knew she said herself I can't me
what she said what she was like
obviously this was just gonna be a
stepping point for you like for what you
want to do in the future so it's not
problem or anything like that but yeah
thank God because can you imagine if I
had got the job and they'd have been
like really not okay with it like I
don't know do you I mean it would have
been so awkward you studio lights are so
hot and I'm like sweating but I really
can't swags I've got fake tan on and a
white bodysuit on not a good mix so yeah
anyway she was like I'll ring you in a
couple of weeks or anything and let you
know how you got on and whether you got
the job and stuff like that so after you
my makeup test again it's just a bit of
a waiting game and things like that feel
like it was about a week after my makeup
test I got the call to say that I got
the job and stuff which I was obviously
over the moon about and then I had I
went on holiday literally the next day
for about five days and then I had my
first shift like the week after that
awesome and I'm and the one thing I will
say obviously I worked in the selfridges
at the time so I didn't have to do
another selfridges interview you're
gonna be a new staff member in
Selfridges or any department store for
that matter like image double names or
whatever else you will have to do a
store interview as well I'm pretty sure
but I'd already have mine for my selfish
so they didn't make me do another one
which was good and I got offered a
full-time contract as well which I was
over the moon about and because there
was like part-time and full-time ones
and going so she basically told me on
the phone and stuff that we want to give
you like a full-time contract and things
and so I worked how many hours did I do
I can't remember but I worked five days
a week I believe I work five days a week
and then when I went to obviously I
started as a Christmas term and then
when I got capped on they did cut my
contrast bit because I asked for it to
be a little bit smaller but yeah started
um November time obviously Christmas is
the busiest time of year for any store
so when you first start and I remember
my first year my first day and stuff I
got up so early to like make sure that
my makeup was absolutely you know
turnout was hanging all the people like
all the stuff that were in on that day
were really lovely um in general the
stuff at my store were really lovely I
got on with like pretty much everyone
really well yeah my chef was like a
10:00 in the morning start I think I'm
so is that she wasn't store open so it
was really quiet when it first opened
and stuff I'm had like brief and things
because with any like you know retail
and stuff you always got brief in the
morning and things like that and run
through a couple of things really
quickly well that was pretty much air
and then he pretty much straight in the
deep end it's like I remember the first
customer I had this lady came up to me
like five minutes after I'd started my
shift and was like hi like I'm looking
to have a foundation match blah blah
blah and I was like okay take a seat
because you don't get any initial
training or anything before you start
the job you kind of just learn stuff as
you go at my muck and
I found pretty much just start your
shift and stuff and you just pick up
things as you go obviously like all the
stuff and like people that will help you
with product knowledge and things like
that but in a way it's good because you
just have to learn stuff so quickly and
like adapt so quickly I had a lady who
wanted a foundation match and stuff
luckily in terms of like my product
knowledge of mark it was probably
strongest with foundations because I
feel like Mac is known for like Studio
Fix and Pro Longwear just foundations in
general and stuff so I feel like I had a
good product knowledge with that when I
started I'm she told me that she wanted
it like full coverage or whatever blah
blah blah so I was like great Studio Fix
I know that widen and then it was just a
case of like getting a shade out and
stuff and much you know in terms of
brushes as well you do get a brush set
and a belt so they provide you with all
that and stuff yeah that was pretty much
it my shift started absolutely loved my
first shift I remember coming home um
afterwards like obviously just like had
a normal shift serving customers and
things like that I remember coming home
and I was just like oh my god mom
absolutely love it like this is a
hundred cent you know what I wanted to
do and things like that blah blah blah
like I was genuinely excited to go to
work the next day obviously I did get
kept on there was about six of us I
think who started his Christmas temps
and the majority of us got captain which
was really cool Christmas was obviously
a super busy time of year so as it got
into December and stuff even if it was a
weekday like the store would just be
jam-packed with people buying presents I
don't know Christmas holidays like it
was just so crazy busy but in a way I
loved that at first
I loved it at first because it just felt
like you share points so quick because
you were constantly serving customers
like you're constantly having something
to do like one thing that I used to not
enjoy as much at Miss Selfridge was the
fact that a lot of the time in the
evenings and stuff and in the day it
just be super quiet and I felt like I
didn't really have a lot to do we're
gonna get onto like answering questions
because I feel like I'm just rambling
now okay so Emma said what experience or
skills did you need to work there so as
I did say before I am self-taught in
makeup I don't have any qualifications
or anything like that and you obviously
need to be a certain age type mark you
need to have your
what's it called what's it called and
we're going what you get when you 16
National Insurance number that's the one
I definitely have a background in retail
and because obviously you are gonna be a
retail artist so it's really important
to have some background in retail and
obviously it's great if you have
qualifications and experience in makeup
as well and I think as long as you can
show that you can do makeup and you have
it some form of experience even if it's
not like a certain qualification or
whatever
I think that's usually enough as well
obviously that's how I got my job yeah I
think it's just a big deal for them to
hire people that really passionate about
makeup and things like that not
necessarily someone who's got a certain
qualification Jessie asked why did you
leave it was kind of like a lot of
little things as to why I laugh so the
main thing was because I was doing
YouTube at the time obviously you guys
know YouTube is my full-time job now and
it got to a point at mark where because
I was doing shifts and serve I felt like
I was missing out on a lot of job
opportunities and events and stuff
because when it comes to chefs like it's
really hard to switch shifts around and
it's really hard to like plan things and
their bunts and stuff like that because
you literally you know working off like
a shift basis and also because like in
general the jog was just a lot more
sales-based than what I expected which
kind of links into a couple of other
questions is to if it's more like based
on the artistry or if it is more sales
and stuff and I personally found that it
was more sales base than artistry
obviously like I said it's important to
you know be able to do makeup and things
like that but it is also a retail job
you're a retail artists you kind of best
like sell products and things I just
never like the sales side of anything
like I just don't feel like I'm very
good at pushing products I don't feel
like I'm very good at like trying to
sell stuff to people like I genuinely
just love doing the makeup and things
like that which I feel like a lot of
people do and some people are really
good at the sales side as well but I
just I don't know I just that's just not
for me
so do bear in mind if you're thinking
about getting a job on a makeup counter
because a lot of the time it will be
retail based as well and sales and stuff
are really important do you want to just
stick to like the makeup side it's
probably worth doing freelance instead
or working in like a makeup studio and
something like that but when you're
retail artist obviously is important to
do sales
which just was not for me at
Christmastime like it didn't matter as
much because it was so busy that we all
obviously always hit targets and things
like sales was just not an issue because
Christmas is such a busy time of the
year that I don't know like sales and
stuff like it's always good but when it
got to January and things and the store
got a bit quieter and stuff and then you
kind of have to work on hitting targets
more and things like I'm just not good
at it
um I don't know I just got to a point
where I just felt like it wasn't for me
okay nicole says was there any
bitchiness between staff members because
you always hear horror stories about Mac
stuff I don't know if you do I feel like
there's this whole thing with like mac
makeup artists and retail artists just
being like pitchy and stuff um I don't
know why like I'm sure people have
probably had horrible experiences in the
past with Mac's app I don't know um but
in general like that's just retail as a
whole I think I feel like because it's
mark people take it like 10 times more
seriously because like it's makeup
whereas like I've been into clothes
stores before and had like nasty
experiences and stuff in there as well I
don't find that it's like any worse just
in mark I don't know if anyone's had any
bad experiences with Mac stuff let me
know in the comments because I'd love to
know and but our store in particular no
bitchiness at all for me personally I
was never involved in any drama I never
found that there was that much stronger
everyone like I said was really lovely
really helpful when I first started in
terms of helping me like sell into the
job and helping the rest of the temps of
was home settling and stuff everyone was
just really nice I can said what made
you want to work for Mac sorry I feel
like I've been runs in for like half an
hour now Mac was like kind of one of the
reasons that I fell in love with makeup
so when I was like 16 15 16 I think and
I had my high school prom it was the
first time I ever got my makeup done and
I got it doing it by I think she was
called Nicole and she was amazing and so
I gotta join it Mac Exchange and it was
the first time I'd ever had like my full
face like fully glowing and stuff like
that obviously was prom makeup it was
super intense and like glowy and you
know fall on and stuff and I just
absolutely loved it like I just loved
the way she did it I love like all the
products and stuff I loved seeing the
whole process and she was so lovely like
just just made me feel like so involved
in things like that it was just such a
good experience
it was from that day forward that I
absolutely just fell in love with makeup
um it got to my 16th birthday so my prom
was when I was 15 it was like a month
before and then when it was my 16th
birthday I literally spent like so much
money on mac makeup I went in and I
bought like I still remember the first
products I bought and stuff I bought a
coppering eyeshadow and an amber light
eyeshadow because the time when I fell
in love with makeup was also at the time
that I found YouTube aren't the first
person that I properly watch was jaclyn
hill but and she had this tutorial on
her channel at the time that was
basically she basically mixed copper
covering eyeshadow and humble heights
and put that all over the lid and I was
just like obsessed so it got to my 16th
and I had like birthday money and stuff
and I went in and bought it and I also
bought my first marelize skin finish
which was medium deep which is what I
think she was called Nicole which is
what Nicole used on my prom for like
bronzer and stuff because my skin looked
really lovely and then I also bought a
soft and gentle Oh everyone loves about
soft and gentle honestly yeah those are
like my first products from Mac um and I
don't know it was just you know a
combination of prom makeup and seeing it
on YouTube and stuff I just fell in love
with the brand it was like that day
forward I was like I'm gonna be McFly's
like I'm gonna do it I was so determined
to work the brand and stuff and I feel
like when you really just him and that
just helps you out tons as well like if
you really want something and you just
got and get it what is going on there um
you know that I'll just taking my
Elizabeth said what if a customer came
in and had difficulties would you
instantly judge them because they were
different no 100% not every single
person that walked into that store got
treated you know equally 100% not no one
would ever get treated if that if that
ever happened like I'd be shocked never
happened at my concert if it happens at
other counters I think it's absolutely
terrible
Missy said what employee benefits did
you get I don't know what did we get so
obviously like when you work at any
store you get discount on the brand feel
like other than like this kind of makeup
I don't think so that was like obviously
the best thing about it though like
having discounted makeup was just so
much fun Vic said were they really
strict about you only wearing mac makeup
yes
especially when people you know other
people to come in and stuff that were
like higher up it was really important
that you wore mark makeup obviously if
you're working for the brand then you
probably like the majority of the
products anyway um but yeah they were
they would always you know kind of check
and surf and eyelashes in particular
were a big one because I feel like when
I worked at mark I don't know if there's
any different now because I haven't
checked up on the eyelashes in a while I
was not personally the biggest fan of
Matt clashes I just they just didn't
really have any styles that suit my eyes
or I feel like looked good on me um and
I know a lot of other people felt like
that as well but obviously we're makeup
artists and we want to wear lashes and
things and be super glam so that was
probably the biggest issue was that
people a lot of the time wouldn't wear
Mac lashes yeah they were super on the
ball where they're obviously it's
important to be wearing the brand and
because especially while I makeup
customers will come up to you and be
like oh my gosh I really like your
lipstick or I really like your
highlighter what are you wearing and it
has to kind of be a Mac product you know
you can't be like oh yeah it's from now
so blastia
hope us did they ever have a problem
with subscribers coming in and saying hi
when you had work oh my gosh that's like
a whole different story you know because
when I actually started in the store no
one knew that I did YouTube so I told
like him I said I mentioned it in like
my interview process and stuff that I do
YouTube because again it was kind of
another form of like showing my skills
and makeup but no one none of the stuff
at my store knew that I did YouTube I
remember the first time I subscriber
came in I can't remember a name I cannot
remember a name if you're watching this
then please remind me of your name I'm
really sorry that I forgot it but this
girl came in and she was I that was like
a dad or a granddad she was with like
some form of family I'm home she walked
oh but she'd been at the lipstick on
several and she walked over with a
lipstick to me and it was quite quiet in
the store that day um and she just burst
into tears so bless her heart she just
burst into tears and started crying she
was like I love your video so much
bubbeleh and I then nearly wanted to cry
because I was like oh my god this is the
sweetest thing ever
and I was like please don't cry you know
gave her a big hug and stuff and we
chatted and things and show me the
lipstick that she wanted and obviously
when it got out the jaws for and then we
took some pictures and things and I'm
I remember at the time like everyone was
looking at me stuff wise like what was
going on everyone was so confused
I remember she laughed and then Ellie
who I'm really good friends this jail
I love Ellie you guys I don't think
you've met a boy so I went to Ariana
with him stuff absolutely love ah she
came over and she was like why the hell
has a girl just cried in front of you
and I basically had to explain himself
that I did YouTube and she was a
subscriber and stuff like that and then
everyone just loved it it was so fab
like everyone was really supportive
about it people did like they didn't
mind I'm you guys coming in and stuff
unless it was like super busy obviously
if it's super busy and stuff then it
wasn't really like the best thing for me
to like stop and chat like in general
other than that they were really
supportive and really fab about it and
everyone loved it which was so cool
we've said were you told to say or not
say certain things to customers um not
that I can think of obviously like one
thing that I said before why does my
highlight look so weird I don't know
obviously like I said before you can't
really like recommend I mean people
obviously do it anyway we're not just
chatting and like doing makeup Mostafa
is you're not really supposed to
obviously recommend other brands this
stuff because that's like just going
against working there so Rhiannon asked
what skills did she learn wash with that
do you know what this is probably when I
look back on my time at mark probably
the best thing about me being was the
amount that I learned in such a short
space of time like I said first up you
kind of just got thrown into the deep
end and you just have to kind of adapt
and adjust work in that and you know
product knowledge you just pick up as
you go along and start just like product
knowledge wise and artistry wise like I
got so much better at makeup in the six
months that I was there like I learned
more there in six months and I did like
do it like I have my whole time doing
makeup because obviously like you just
constantly around makeup artists and
people who have been doing it for longer
than you and people who know stuff that
you don't know but people that know
stuff that you don't know yeah you're
like literally that was probably when I
look back the best thing about working
with me because even though those times
when I just like would pull my hair
because I feel like everyone has times
when working in retail where you just
like no I can't do this
whatever I was like definitely a hundred
percent the best thing about working
there and the reason that I'm like most
grateful to have worked there is just
the amount that I learn in such a short
space of time
okay so Lauren asks did you ever do the
makeovers and if so how many so I never
actually did obviously I did bits of
makeup and foundation matches and stuff
like that but I never did appointments
because at mark you have to have gone
for training to do appointments so the
way it works is you kind of like build
up your own like qualifications there so
you start off with pretty sure what's
called like basic training you go on
training and stuff and you come back and
your first certification is and hot it's
a half an hour yeah pretty sure it's
like half an hour makeovers so at mark
you can either get makeup is done which
are half an hour long which is kind of
like you know a focus area or just a
really light wash of everything and then
you have be 60 minutes with 60 minutes
sorry which is like your full face of
glam which is what I had for my prom and
what people would have when they came in
for like event makeup and parties and
stuff like that and then you have your
lessons so lessons are an hour and a
half I believe and basically you would
have an artist do half of half of your
face and then you would do the other
half and you basically learn how to do
the makeup and stuff like that it was
lecture just a lesson so in terms of
like doing makeup you had to do
certifications for every single one and
basically go through another like makeup
test I guess
and so then be able to actually do them
on counter yeah you basically to do all
of those you do go on like a week's
worth of training so you are actually
off the counter for a week and you go
away I never got to that stage because I
only worked there six months so I feel
like just as I left is when they started
doing because basically with training as
well is it only comes around every now
and then and you have to like book
people onto wait you can't just send
people off for training whenever so just
so you know I pretty much just went in
it with this shade here in the crease
and then
but the outer corner a tiny bit with
that shade just that and then I just
went in with the dark brown in the
middle of the bottom row just as like my
wing kind of so I just popped some
lashes on I just use J makeups by Lilly
luscious now I'm just gonna highlight my
inner corner with Mac nylon my favorite
Mac product ever well one of them BAE
and then for lips I've got two of the
new Kylie cosmetics lip kits I don't
know what color to use I think I'm gonna
use this shade so this is the shade
hazel so I'm just gonna line my lips
with the liner first and then pop the
lipstick on top and we'll see how it
looks obviously I can't speak this part
either so be right back okay so this is
a pretty much the finished look if
you've got any questions about any of
the products I use it let me know
because obviously I know I don't really
speak through the makeup in this eye so
pretty much saved the one of the most
asked questions the last which is about
my customer experience and if I have any
like funny customer stories or rude
customer stories which believe me
there's a lot of I feel like the
funniest one was probably I'm not like
funny in a funny way but like just my
favorite one was when like I said at
that first subscriber came in a homer
she was just so sweet and so lovely I
feel like she was called like Daisy
no not Daisy I don't know I can't run
running I'm so sorry if you watching
this I absolutely loved you I loved
these pieces and you guys are my
favorite customer experience obviously
like you were just always so fab and so
far like so kind when you came in
probably my least favorite thing was
doing foundation much kiss it got to a
point like it gets to a point working on
any well I don't know about any makeup
concert but especially mark where people
would constantly come in wanting a
foundation March and that was probably
my least favorite thing to do in terms
of rude customers okay
so overall like I feel like makeup
counters and you know other stores in
general do get a good fair share of rude
customers and there's one girl that will
always stick in my mind so clearly
because there was a time when I was on
counter and this girl was just so rude
to me that I genuinely nearly cried I
honestly had to step away and self and
like get a supervisor involved and get
someone else to server because she was
just so nasty
basically what happened is
girl came in with a mom she must have
been about my age so she got in 19 I
think from what I gathered and like I
said she came in with a mom which
everything that happened afterwards it
just shocked me because if I'd gone
shopping with my mom and spoke to a
sales assistant the way she spoke to me
my mom would have lost it okay so anyway
this girl comes in she seems really nice
at first really lovely she basically
walks up to me I'm obviously not serving
anyone um and she's like hi like I'm
looking to get a foundation can you just
help me with a foundation match so I'm
like sure sit down in a chair and stuff
her mom's you know obviously that as
well and she did have a makeup on at the
time so a lot of the time when you do
foundation matches and stuff you'll say
am i okay to just remove a little bit on
your cheek or if not you know can I test
on your neck like am i okay to you know
whatever I start asking her questions
because obviously with foundation you
have to know skin type if their skins
normal dry oily whatever and what kind
of coverage you're looking for and if or
not you like to go darker with your
foundation because a lot of the time
girls and guys would come in and they'd
want like a darker foundation for fake
tan or you know they just want a
different shade for whatever reason and
I started asking me these questions and
burning mine she's been so polite and
stuff when she asked about a foundation
mind I just thought it was gonna be you
know a bog-standard
customer foundation match wiper so I
said to her you know what what she skin
type is it normal dry oily and she just
turns around and goes aren't you
supposed to know that and I was like
well you know what someone just say she
saw a card that you like okay I I said
to her no like you know it's your skin I
can't tell just by looking at it you
need to tell me like your experience you
know what you think your skin is like
and you know your experience with
foundations and past blah blah blah
whatever I said she basically turn
around was just like I don't know and I
was like oh my god I'm really gonna have
to do this so then I asked her about
coverage in sad you know I said how much
coverage she want for my foundation
because my carnations range from like
Studio Fix which is like basically
cement to face and body which is
obviously super natural
she just started like going in at me
like I was asking these questions try to
help her out trying to get some
information trying to find other out
foundation and she was just having none
of it okay and she was like Yoga make
part is why don't you know why you're
asking all these questions and bla bla
bla bla bla at the time like I just got
so flustered and so like I don't know
I just felt so uncomfortable all of a
sudden and I could just feel my face
flushing like I could feel my eyes
watering because I was like what the
hell do I do so I walked off and I just
got her studio fix because Studio Fix is
the most you know popular foundation we
do or whatever and I just got a shade
that looked like it much I removed a
little bit of a foundation on a face
here and then basically just put the
studio fix on top at this point we
weren't even speaking I wasn't saying
anything to us I didn't want to Sarah
off she wasn't saying anything to me her
mom said nothing my mom did not say a
word and I put the foundation on her and
stuff and then it got her a mirror
because obviously you know show the
question the mirror ask them if they
like it whatever else so I got the
mirror and I held it up and I was like
how is that for ya I just wanted to keep
it really short and sweet okay she looks
in the mirror she starts giving me all
these looks like as if again she's gonna
say you know I don't know you tell me
and she literally just turns around and
goes I don't feel like you know what
you're talking about I don't feel like
helping me go get someone else so I was
like shocked again okay at this point
she had literally come for me and my
skills as a makeup artists and was like
you don't know what you're doing go get
someone else you want to help me so I
was like fine didn't say anything to her
put the mirror down and just went
straight over to my supervisor so he was
on shift at the time and at that point
like I said I got so flustered and I
felt so uncomfortable and I could feel
my eyes burning I was like you need to
help me this customer I don't know how
to handle I'm honestly gonna burst into
tears I don't have to say the one good
thing like one of the good things about
working at Mac and stuff is that you
know managers and supervisors were
always so supportive when it came to
rude and difficult customers if they
ever felt that you were being mistreated
by a customer or customer was being
unnecessarily rude like there was so
supportive
we went on the side because genuinely
like I'd got myself into such a just
fourth sign I explained the situation I
was like I'm trying to give this girl a
foundation March and she's having none
of it she's being really unhelpful
really like verbally aggressive like
she's just not being helpful at all then
obviously he went over to her and
basically said you know I'm gonna get
another member of staff to help you but
I don't appreciate the way you spoke to
Hana basically explains well you know
she has to ask you about your niece key
and she can't just guess I mean
basically said I'm gonna get another
member of staff to help you
but if you are rude again to whatever
member of stuff it is I will have to ask
you to leave because it's not that on
the stuff and then I just stayed far
away okay I was like I'm going to the
other side of the concert right now and
then one of the other girls came over
helps with the foundation and stuff blah
blah blah and I'm pretty sure she ended
up actually going around the side into
the appointment area because where she
was sat in the concert was quite like it
was in the middle of the country you
know lots of customers are about stuff
like that so she went round to the
appointment area where it was quite a
got a foundation and stuff and I'm
pretty sure it was all fine the other
girl who served her then came over and
was like yeah completely understand what
you mean she was difficult bla bla bla
and I think in the end what happened is
like she did actually end up apologizing
and stuff and she said she basically got
ratty and stuff because she's not
comfortable with a skin and not
confident in her skin and it just made
her like really ratty and you know she
apologized itself which was obviously
good I'm pretty sure she did
if I remember correctly she should have
either way because like I just don't
think it's ever acceptable to speak rude
to retail people I just don't think it's
appropriate and but that was probably
the rudest person I ever had and it
doesn't even sound like that bad but I
think it was because it's the first time
I ever had like just a really snappy
nasty customer and although not like you
got rude people every now and then but I
never really had anyone else to that
extent where I just felt really
uncomfortable I just remember thinking
afterwards like I went home and stuff
and I was thinking about it for the rest
of my shift really just like I said
really stuck in my mind because she was
so just verbally aggressive I just
couldn't get over how a mom just stood
there and said nothing like I don't know
I'm not one to judge like situations and
stuff so I'm sure there was like you
know personal stuff going on I don't
know but if that was my mom and I was
speaking into a member of staff like
that like a sales assistant or whatever
it is she would literally drag me out by
my hair and slap me silly but I think
that's pretty much it that's pretty much
my whole experience working at Marc
different like personal experiences
things I think I've answered everything
that is that answer if you don't feel
like I have let me know in the comments
if you've got any questions let me know
because I'm obviously open to speaking
about it and answering stuff and things
like that and but thank you so much for
watching if you want to see it more of
these let me know in the comments what
other topics you want me to speak about
because I'd love to know
but other than that thank you for
watching I love you guys to the moon
aback a million times over on I'll see
you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
