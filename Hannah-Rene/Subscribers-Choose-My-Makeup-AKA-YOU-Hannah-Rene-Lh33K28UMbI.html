don't usually upload on a Monday but
today it's a little bit different I did
actually have a video planned for Sunday
yesterday which I'm basically gonna re
film and redo it now because so many
things went wrong with Sunday's video
and it just got to the point where I was
editing it and I was not happy with it
at all so I thought we'd just start
fresh start fresh and do it again so
yeah the video that I'm gonna be filming
is my subscribers pic my makeup kind of
video I don't really know what you call
it I've seen these going around a lot on
YouTube recently I'm not entirely sure
who actually started it so if anyone
knows please let us know in the comments
because obviously we want to give a girl
or a guy credit huge thank you to
everyone who got involved on Twitter and
suggested products and things like that
I had so much fun paging them all you
want to be involved in the next one at
first of all if you enjoyed this video
be sure to give it a big thumbs up so
that I know to do more and if you want
to be involved in the next one make sure
you follow me on Twitter because it's
just the easiest place to like ask
people and chat to you guys and stuff
like that okay so the first product was
suggested by the lovely topaz she
basically asked for the L'Oreal tattoo
brow definers which are these little
guys right here said it creates a
natural micro plaited effect on the
brows I think you should try to see if
it's similar to your already microplate
brows and if it would help when they
need to be doing and start fading etc
etc I actually forgot to use these in
the first video that I filmed so these
are kind of a bit of a first impression
because I'm not tried them yeah it's a
very interesting product I'm not sure if
I'm gonna love it to be completely
honest this is what the tip looks like
so I don't know if you can see but it's
basically got three little oh it's not
got four actually it's basically got
four like little pen things basically is
meant to give the effect of hairs
because when you apply it you got like
four strokes from it and it kind of
looks like natural hairs if that makes
sense the only reason I'm worried that
I'm not gonna like it is because I do
prefer a bit of like a more structured
defined brow which is why I use pomade
and stuff whereas this seems to give
like a more natural effect so basically
what I'm finding is that when I apply it
to my brows because the pen is up and
upwards degree if that makes sense not a
lot of product comes out whereas when I
swatch it on the back of my hand and
have the pen downward so that products
moving up towards like the actual tear
then I get product so if you can see
there's like a decent amount of pigment
now on the
my hunger pens like upside down but then
when I go to actually apply it in my
brows because the pens now upwards it's
just not given as much color payoff
varies alright but I think it's
definitely more of like a natural brow
product so if you're after something for
like every day or maybe you've got like
really full brows already and you just
want something to kind of enhance them
then this could do the job but I don't
know it's looking alright now that we've
kind of built it up a bit I guess I'm
just gonna use a bit of brow pomade with
it just to kind of like enhance it a
little bit more okay a browser on I just
use pomade on the other side because
it's just quicker for me to use okay
moving on to eyes I'm gonna prime them
with the concealer that I'll be picked
out on Twitter just because I always
prime my lids with whatever can see that
I'm gonna use anyway so I don't
necessarily use like a separate eye
primer so I be asked for the nip and fab
concealer which is this little guy she
said it's supposed to be a jute for Mac
select cover up I want to see if it's
true and what you think I got this in
the shade 0 5 and 15 what I found with
this is that you really do not need a
lot so I've just put a little bit on the
back of my hand for now and then I'm
just gonna go in with a Mac - 5 - just
to carve the brow and prime the lid as
you can see like it's pretty full
coverage so you really don't need a lot
I'm not sure about it under the eyes um
obviously I did wear it the other day
when I filmed I think it's just a little
bit too thick and heavy for my under eye
like it creases quite bad when it first
goes on under the eyes it looks really
nice but after a couple of hours where
it kind of just looked a bit of a mess
okay moving on to eyes I'm really
excited to try this out this was
suggested by Daisy so Daisy asked for
one of the Julius Julius Julius lluvias
plays eyeshadow palette am I saying that
right
I do actually know she said I'm really
curious about them and I'm contemplating
buying a palette but I want to know your
opinion first because I trust it thank
you
so nice to know that you chose my
opinion so I used the bigger palette the
other day the one that's got like reds
and oranges and things like that a link
both
down below but seeing as I didn't use
this one I thought I'd give this one a
go and kind of use it as a bit of a
first impression and things like that
just gonna start with the shade here I
do actually what this pie it's called
the Nubian I'm just gonna pop this in
the crease I think I'm just gonna do
like a soft a soft glum look shall we
I dunno this was the issue the other day
like when I was filming I didn't really
know what kind of look I was gonna do
ask kind of just making up as I went
along and then by the end I just hated
it is you can get on beautybay by the
way so if anyone's interested in getting
one in the UK these pallets are on
beautybay only thing with this palette
is it's not got very many maps in so I'm
just trying to build this one up as much
as possible because the next matte shade
is that one there I'm gonna go in with
that shade it's like this shade here and
just hope for the bath ya know they are
pretty pigmented so I don't know what
I'm doing I have no idea what I'm doing
this is my issue like I actually need to
plan looks in my head you're like as you
blend them out you definitely lose a bit
of the color payoff which is pretty
common with any eye shadow really like
as you blend it out it just softens the
whole thing so I'm just going back in a
couple of times with a little bit more
on the brush and then just blending it
out oh my gosh is anyone watch on
Netflix the end of the world
it's always saying it like that because
that's actually the title but it's
pretty rude you know you ain't can watch
it in one sitting the other night cuz
the episode is quite short the only 20
minutes longer so does everyone think
because the reason we watch it is
because we've seen it everywhere like
everyone talking about it on Twitter and
stuff and it was good but it was just
all so random I don't know if it's like
made by the people who do black mirror I
doubt because they had two of their
actors that had been in like previous
black mirror episodes so kind of had
like a similar vibe as well I don't know
why I like the whole thing just felt
quite similar okay so that is what I've
done so far I feel like this one's
nowhere near as bondage it's like I I
don't know what
well it's always the way so I just cut
my lid with a little bit of concealer
like I always do you guys have seen me
do that like a million times so I didn't
bother filming it but I just used the
same concealer that was on the back of
my hand and I'm going to use that really
pretty like dark copper shade because it
looks like one of the most sparkly in
the palette as well like some of them
definitely have more not really like
glitter but just more of a sparkles and
although I'm gonna use a bit fix blush
just because I always use fix plus for
like sparkly eyeshadows oh my god it's
so pretty that applied so easily like
just so smooth probably one of the
easiest shimmer eye shadows I've ever
used in the sense that like you don't
need to work too hard to get it pigment
okay onto lashes these were one of my
favorite products I use in the last
video I thought they were so cute though
these were recommended by Megan and
these Ally dollop Beauty lashes in this
style Chloe Elizabeth I think it is yeah
I said they are the best everyday it
lashes oh no the best lashes and I wear
them everyday they are so fluffy and I
feel like you will love them as well she
was not wrong I absolutely love these it
was so easy to apply and they looked
like really just fluffy and full on the
eyes if that makes sense
okay ribbon under skin obviously the
first thing that we're gonna use is
primer and this was recommended by Emily
she asked fully benefit that girl primer
which I got a little mini mangas I
thought this was so cute she said it's
so soft and it smells amazing
which I'm pretty sure I have actually
used this before obviously I use it when
I filmed this video of the first time
around and I'm pretty sure I did use it
before that as well because I remember
it's quite like a pink primer in a sense
because it's like a brightening primer
and I remember using it and it just
making my face look like a marshmallow
so I'm just gonna apply it to the skin
there's one thing I learnt with this
primer it's that you really do not need
a lot of it it smells so good
great and then foundation I was so
excited to try this out and I did
actually really enjoy it the first time
I used it this was suggested by kelsa so
this is the ordinary coverage like high
coverage foundation it comes in
a little container like this so the
reason that kalsa asked for this is just
to basically find out if it's any good
because it claims to be full coverage
and it's only six pounds so that's a
bargain okay for a full coverage
foundation the way that I applied it the
other day which is the same way I'm
going to use it today is with a looksie
angled brush I got so many questions on
this foundation brush it's not actually
just for foundation it's for like
anything you want to use an angled brush
for but I just love it foundation I feel
like it works so well covers pretty well
it's quite like a natural finish it's
more unlike the jewy side I would say
what okay I mean it's not the best
foundation I've ever used in my entire
life I prefer my la girl because I feel
like it's pretty similar but it's just a
little bit a little bit better and it's
quite a similar price point
no it looks okay on the skin blends out
really easily it's very liquidy okay and
then before I go back in with concealer
I'm gonna use the Kevin a Kwan contour
palette which was asked for by Tasha
though she said I really want to try it
but I'm not sure if it's gonna be worth
the money I also have a feeling it's
gonna be tiny so let us know if the
product is insane enough for the price
obviously you know I'm always gonna be
honest not too small and I wouldn't want
it to be any bigger I don't think just
because if you're going to travel with
it and stuff like that it's quite a nice
size and the pen size in side is alright
as well it's a little bit bigger than
like an Anastasia Beverly Hills contour
palette and I do like that it's a
rectangle rather than a circle because I
feel like it's easier to use with your
brush there's also come with like a star
kind of intro and how to use it and
things like that and then in terms of
the product I've got a mirror which is
really handy it's got a cream contour
and a cream highlighter powder contour
powder highlighter and then some eye
shadow colors which I'll try these on
the under-eye because I didn't test
these the other day and obviously like
it's part of the product so we'll give
it a go I'm gonna use the cream contour
shade first because I didn't realize the
other day that I had a cream contour
shade athos all powders so I didn't
manage to apply this because I'd already
set my skin
oh it's not really showing up a lies it
up it's very cool definitely like a
contour shade rather than something to
warm up the skin just going to buff it
out with the backstage beauty brush that
I always use
it's alright but it's just like cooler
than what I would usually use I don't
like this I don't like this until I feel
like this is just not for me I prefer my
console sticks I'm not convinced on that
really after all I'm gonna move back
onto the concealer so I'm just gonna use
the same nip and fab concealer and again
just mix at the two shades under my eyes
I think the key with this is just not to
apply too much that might have been
where I went wrong the first time and
why it kind of seemed cakey on my skin
and then the powder that we're gonna be
using 2sat the whole face including the
under-eye was recommended by Vicky this
is the Illamasqua loose powder she said
I love it and I feel like no one ever
speaks or uses Illamasqua anymore which
is interesting because I don't tend to
see it a lot on YouTube either for some
reason I don't know why in this
concealer is nice I just don't know if
it's the best concealer out there for my
skin type maybe it's a powder I guess
like I won't know until I use them
separately because it could be the
powder that's making it look cakey but
the powder is so fine that I'd be really
surprised you know and then back onto
this situation I'm gonna use the powder
I just don't know with this palette I
don't think it's worth the money at all
I think 55 pounds is a lot of money for
a palette it's a shame because I do
really like other products from this
brand but this is just not one of them I
will just test out the shadows under the
eyes I'll just use the too much shades
because they're kind of like a similar
vibe to what we've got on anyway so I'll
just give those ago just so that we've
tested them out oh wow that pigmented
okay yeah so that I should have I'm
feeling like way more I'll try out this
shade on the inner corner as well
actually this is the shade brighten oh
it's alright
it's actually quite pretty okay so that
I shadows are yes I'm gonna try some
more of those out and what the contour
palette is a no from me so personally I
wouldn't recommend this but if anyone's
got this and loves it then let me know
how you use it and stuff like that cuz
obviously it's probably just me the way
I'm using it on my skin or whatever else
okay the one product that I've
completely forgot to use and should I
use it again I don't know I did you
since the first time run and I wasn't
blown away by this so this was asked
what by Stacey she said please can you
try the new corner of xsplit are
highlights and drops because I would
love to know if they're worth the money
so these are 30 pounds which is pretty
expensive for like a highlight in liquid
highlighted situation it remind me a lot
of my barium drop so if you want a more
affordable then I would recommend those
over these at the glitters not cheap not
too chunky or anything like that cuz I
was worried about how they'd actually
blend what they're absolutely fine gonna
try it a little bit even though I've
powder because some people say you can
use liquid highlighter on top of harder
and it's fine but I'm not convinced so
we'll find out yeah that's a no yeah I
know that's a firm no I did find that
they were a little bit difficult to
blend anyway even on non-partisan like
on just wet foundation so they're not my
favorite things I've ever used I feel
like they're very similar to the baryon
ones if you want something more
affordable okay in terms of powder
highlighter
Jass us for the sleek solstice
highlights in palette because she
already has it and loves it I already
have it in loved it as well so it's
winning that this is a palette that I
always forgot to use for some reason I
don't know why it's like a really good
um affordable highlighting kit mmm why
is my voice is gonna yeah I love this
I've always loved it any season more
often for some reason I just forgot but
it is a really good little kit so just
I'm glad you love it as much as I do
and then the last product we've got to
test out was recommended by Holly so she
asked for the morphe liquid lipstick
because she saw the hyper while back and
wants to know if they're worth a hype I
guess so I picked up two shades I'm
gonna use the one that I didn't use in
my other video so we're using a
different product and this is in the
shade it suspects you like
I'll tie in with the eyes quite well
I'll actually much more t-shirt as well
so I'm just gonna go straight in with
this I'm not gonna bother with a liner
and we'll see how it goes okay so this
is the lip shade on I do find them
pretty easy to apply considering I don't
use them with a liner I didn't use them
with liner I probably usually would go
up for the purpose of the video I just
tested it out by itself all in all I'm
pretty happy with this look what do
y'all think our product I wasn't a
massive fan of more of like a natural
Brown situation the lashes I love
absolutely love love love the eyeshadow
palette I love the foundation is pretty
good for six fans I'm not gonna lie at
the cabinet cone situation I'm not a
massive fan of probably wouldn't
recommend that and the concealer if you
have like more oily skin I feel like
you'll love the concealer I hope you
want something that's super full
coverage and your under eye can take
like a full coverage concealer then I
think you'll really enjoy it as well so
yeah I know I'm pretty happy with the
look I hope you all enjoyed this video
and thank you so much to all of you guys
who tweeted me and suggested products
because you know we couldn't turn this
video without yeah I'm gonna go anyway
because I need to edit this and get it
up tonight but thank you so much for
watching I love you guys I mean about a
million times over as always and I'll
see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
