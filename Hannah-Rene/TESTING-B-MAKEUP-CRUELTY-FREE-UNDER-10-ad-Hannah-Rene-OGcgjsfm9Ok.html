you're having a lovely week today we are
gonna be doing a makeup tutorial on this
look here which I've just finished unit
now obviously and I'm so happy with the
way it came out I'm absolutely obsessed
there I feel like it looks really
healthy and natural and just glowy which
is what I'm all about with a minute like
I don't know about anyone else but I'm
kind of not ditching the full coverage
look but I'm kind of really enjoying a
natural makeup as well so this video
it's actually in collaboration with the
makeup which I am so excited about I'm
really excited to be working with there
so everything that you see on my face
right now is a B makeup product which is
amazing because everything is vegan
cruelty free and super affordable which
we all love we all love some good
bargains now they really pride
themselves on being a vegan and cruelty
free which is obviously something to be
super proud of so the brand is super
ethical and like I said really
affordable which I absolutely love I
actually had the chance to go to London
a couple of weeks ago as well and go on
an immersion day with them which was
amazing it was really lovely to meet so
many people that are involved in the
brand I actually got to meet Cassy Lomas
as well which was incredible because she
actually has her own range within the
brand which I've used a little bit of
today and she was able to educate me on
the products and stuff on what she loves
and the best ways to use them and things
like that so I feel like I came into
this video with a good bit of knowledge
she now so yeah I think that's
everything if you want to see how I
achieve this makeup look then just keep
watching
okay so I've already prepped my skin
off-camera I've just moisturize and
stuff like that which is where my skin
is looking a little bit glowy actually I
haven't rubbed it in properly nice one
Hannah so the first product I'm gonna go
in with is the B makeup of brows styler
which basically has an eyebrow pencil at
one end and then it also has a spoolie
or like a little brow brush at the other
so I'm just gonna comb through my brows
I need to look after my brows that I
like I never trimmed them or anything
and I just leave them to go crazy I
think this is the shape dark brown I'm
gonna leave everything linked down below
but the actual color payoff is really
good which I really like with his some
brow pencils I feel like you have to
apply them quite with quite a lot of
pressure if that makes sense to get like
the desired look also the shape of its
really nice it's kind of like a triangle
shape so it's really nice to sort of
create natural like the look of a
natural brow the color is really nice as
well I don't like brow products I feel
like I've mentioned this quite a few
times but I don't like brow products
that
to warn because I feel like my hair is a
little bit on the cooler side at the
minute so I'd rather have a cooler brow
product as well to kind of match me and
that was pretty quick and easy if you
ask me and I don't even use brow pencils
a lot I usually use like a pomade
instead okay so brows are done I'm
actually gonna do skin next because I
don't want to do anything too heavy
today so I don't need to do eyes first
so the primer that we're gonna use is
the bee makeup a prime minute souffle it
just comes in a little pot like this so
the thing that I loved about this when I
first I'm not used on my face yet but
when I first kind of felt it in the pot
it's like really soft so it kind of
feels quite bouncy it's like it's like a
souffle like a souffle so I'm just gonna
go in with a little bit in the center of
my face because with this primer it's
kind of more of like a smoothing primer
it helps to fill any pause and stuff
like that I never used to use a primer
that was kind of poor filling or
smoothing but recently in my like
sensual t-zone area if you like my pores
have been a lot more visible so I've
really been enjoying using one yeah it
kind of just helps to smooth the skin
out in terms of foundation we've got the
bee makeup silk foundation which just
looks like so so I've got two shades
i've got w 4 and w at 6.5 so i'm hoping
they're gonna much cuz i've got a little
bit of tan on this just says create a
healthy radiant look with be flawless
silk foundation long lasting light to
medium buildable coverage with a
lightweight feel one product we've also
got which I was gonna say filet this is
the bee makeup in collaboration with
Cassie Lomas the sheer liquid
illuminator
it just says create a natural-looking
radiance with this be sheer liquid
illuminator helps to enhance your
complexion and give a healthy glow and
then it's also got a little section on
the back which is kind of like Cassie's
tips for the product and one of them is
to mix it in with your foundation to
give a more radiant finish right so that
is w-4 it might be a bit dark to be
honest but we're just gonna wing it see
how it was for it's like a really pretty
kind of pearlescent pink color so when
my camera decides to focus that is what
the - it looks like that I'm gonna go in
with the B make up a duo fiber brush and
just mix it all together on the back of
my hand for some reason I've been
enjoying like less coverage recently
which I know sounds crazy because I
usually love like full coverage glam but
recently
I've just been really enjoying kind of
like a your skin but better look be like
when it gets into summer months not that
with anyone named summer but when it
gets like slightly sunnier outside and
stuff like I prefer a little bit less
coverage which I don't usually say you
don't usually get me say that so if I'm
absolutely loving this like the finish
with that liquid illuminates it looks
really lovely it looks really chewy also
the thing that I like about this brush
because I don't usually use duo fiber
brushes because I feel like depending on
what the hairs are like for the brush
like they tend to absorb quite a lot of
product but that's literally taking all
the product and applied it to my face
rather than absorbing any which is
really nice I like really happy with
that you can see on camera at my skin
still got a little bit of a glow going
on looks really healthy like it just
looks like my skin and I'm really
impressed with that brush like honestly
for a duo fiber brush obviously with
everything being like cruelty-free and
vegan I'm assuming this is synthetic
hair so I really like that because it's
literally not absorbed any of the
product okay so we've got cream bronzer
and concealer which I'm really happy
about because I love it cream bronzer
again I feel like it looks really
natural on the skin the product that
we've got is the sculpt and highlight
contour stick so it's actually double
ended it's got a highlight stick one
side and a contour stick the other so
I'm just gonna apply it underneath the
cheekbones around the jaw definitely
feels really creamy yeah I've done that
a bit high my job is no great what brush
am I gonna use a full charges turn the
foundation brush for now what kind of
works it's already got a little bit
product on I'm gonna do the jaw line
with my foundation brush because jaw
line especially like you want it to be
super blended oh my god how quickly did
that blend it and I'm sorry but in the
time I was speaking about blending you
jaw line that's literally blended what
the hell yeah no I love cream bronzer
and cream contour because I feel like
it's definitely a lot more natural than
powder
so for concealer we've got a couple of
options you could either use the
highlight inside of the contour SiC
which I'm probably not gonna use just
because I'm not a massive fan of cream
concealers life under my eyes anyway and
then we've got the flawless at duo
concealer which actually comes with two
shades want to help sort of cancel
any dark circles or whatever kind of
like it's a correction beam and then
once a bright em which is really cool
and then we've also got the illuminating
radiance pan which the fact that it has
radiance in the name you already know
I'm gonna use it so I think we're gonna
try this first this is in the shade 0-2
new yeah okay so already I can tell it's
a little bit more of a thinner
consistency definitely probably gonna
give us more of a natural coverage and
then they kindly gave me a massive pack
of their sponges which come we just take
a minute for the size of this sponge
like I'm obsessed they had a couple of
different shapes those one that was more
of a standard sort of tear drop shape
but this one was just calling my name
because it has like the flat sides
definitely a bit firmer than I'm used to
is what I will say so okay will that
blend it up very quickly as well I'm
gonna apply it a tiny bit more just to
see how it bill this sponge is like so
soft you barely have to like touch the
skin I feel like we've definitely got a
bit more coverage out of that that
builds really well as well like it's not
going cakey or anything like that it
still looks really smooth and really
seamless okay so I did have a powder but
I can't seem to find it anywhere so
we're just gonna skip the powder today
which I know for some people might be
like the worst thing ever but because I
have joyous skin anyway it doesn't
matter too much and the concealer isn't
actually creasing asshole so I feel like
it doesn't really need to set in much
anyway so we're just gonna move straight
onto eyes so in the custody Loomis
collection she's actually brought out a
bunch of pigments which i swatched these
on the immersion day and I just fell in
love they were gorgeous so we've got
glamoflage at the bottom supermodel
shine on and then hashtag it's them so
when it cuz he was kind of talking me
through the products and stuff she
basically explained that she wanted to
make something that was kind of metallic
and had a really nice shine to it but
wasn't too chunky or too heavy so the
idea is that you can kind of really
build them up if you want a really
metallic high shine finish or you can
just wad them a little bit more natural
as well if you just want a light wash of
color I'm literally just gonna take some
on my finger and it's kind of like a
really nice pale gold color and I'm
literally just gonna pop this all over
the lids I always find that using your
finger with pigments just works a lot
better than using a brush I'm gonna take
it a little bit into the crease as well
because this is gonna be pretty much our
main lid and crease color okay so that
is on actually really love the color of
it because it looks quite natural on the
lid even though it's got a bit of
shimmer to it and then I'm actually
gonna mix super module and shine on
which is more of like a white gold
because she mentioned that one really
good way to use them as well is like a
highlighter for the cheekbones and jaw
so this is just the bee makeup a fan
brush and I'm just gonna grab those
pigments on the bristles and then just
apply them to the cheekbones and because
they're really finely milled and stuff
and they're not chunky or anything they
actually blend onto the skin really well
which is lovely great now I've also got
a radiance powder just to add even more
radiance to the skin I'm gonna use a
powder brush and I'm just gonna it's
kind of like quite a large brush for
this but I'm just gonna swirl them all
up together and just kind of apply this
on the apples of the cheeks it's kind of
like a mix between a blush and a
highlighter I would say because it's got
a couple of darker tones and um for me
it will work quite well as like a bit of
a blush that actually had quite a lot of
color payoff so I've probably applied a
bit too much did anyone else do that
it's like whenever I've got an itch in
my face I always like use my sponge or
whatever brushes in my hand yeah that is
how the skin is looking the skins
basically done now so another product in
the bee makeup range this is actually
the brow contour kit so if you're not
comfortable using brow pencils you
obviously could use this instead and use
a brush I'm actually gonna use this
today to do a little bit of like a liner
vibe so what I've been doing recently
I've not been using a wing I'm using a
wing I've not been doing a wing and I'm
not been using any liquid liner or any
pencil liners and I've literally just
been taking a little bit of eyeshadow
and just kind of smudging that into the
lashes I personally really like the look
of like elongated eyes and cat eyes like
I love the way a little flick can kind
of really left at the eyes so it's up to
you if you want to do this you don't
have to do this step if you don't want
to I'm just gonna take the darker colour
I've kind of gonna mix them together
actually they're both really cool to
them which is nice and I'm literally
just gonna press this in to the lashline
it's also just gonna help to thicken the
lashes as well so you literally just
want to press it right at the lash line
and then I'm also gonna flick it out a
tiny bit
so don't know if you can tell the
difference with this eye and that eye
but this one just has a little bit more
definition now but it doesn't look happy
or anything like that and then I also
like to do the same just a tiny bit on
the lower lashes just on the very outer
corner because again I feel like it just
helps to sort of elongate your eyes and
make them look a little bit more lifted
and then we just need to do a mascara
and lips so the mascara I'm using is the
B makeup volumizing mascara so it's just
got a really thick brush I'm just gonna
coat my lashes with that for lips we've
got the lip liner in the shade zero one
nude so I'm just gonna outline my entire
lips with this and then in terms of an
actual liquid lip we've got the cut zero
mass liquid lipstick which is in the
shade all about me I actually try this
on on the immersion day and absolutely
loved it it's like a really nice kind of
nude rosy ting okay so this is the
finished look I really hope you all like
it I'm absolutely obsessed with it the
skin especially like I feel like the
skin just looks really healthy and
natural which I'm absolutely living for
the pigment as well I'm absolutely
obsessed with especially for the fact
that you can use it as a highlighter as
well I think that's really cool and the
cream bronzer oh my gosh so impressed
with that so yeah I really hope you all
enjoyed this tutorial thank you so much
to be makeup for collaborating with me
on this I had so much fun at the
immersion day and so much fun at filming
it with these products thank you so much
for watching it as always I love you
guys the moon and back a million times
over and I'll see you in the next one
