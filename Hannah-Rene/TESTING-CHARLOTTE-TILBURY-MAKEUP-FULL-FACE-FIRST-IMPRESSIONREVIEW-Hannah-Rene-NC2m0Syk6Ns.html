going to be a testing video because I
feel like it's been a hot minute since I
sat down and did like a full testing
video of like a full one brand so if you
follow me on social media you'll know
that I've been planning to do this one
for awhile I actually got the products
quite a while ago now and I've resisted
so hard to like touch them and play with
them because I wanted to save all them
for this video and so today we are
testing at Charlotte Tilbury makeup and
I'm pretty sure this is like the first
high and one of these I've done and I
thought these would be beneficial as
much as the drugstore ones are because
obviously when you buy in like high-end
expensive products that you want to know
its cause before you spend the money
because it's way more of an investment
and like getting something affordable so
this is the look that I've come up with
it is all Charlotte Tilbury and I'm
really happy with the way it comes out
there's definitely some things that I
like more than others and some things I
think are worth the money so you'll get
to see all that in the video but I
really hope you all like it give it a
massive thumbs up if you do yeah I hope
you enjoyed this video and find it
useful and if you want to see how I
achieve this makeup and what I think of
Charlotte Tilbury products then just
keep watching I want to see so excited
to do this video because these products
cost me an arm and a leg like literally
not literally but literally you know so
to prime the skin I got the Charlotte
Tilbury wonder glow which just looks
like so the packaging for all of our
products is stunning like I personally
love it so this just says turn around
tired dull skin in a beauty flash
powered by a fluorescent color that
converts the UV light into skin at
luminosity for an instant soft focus
spot light effect can be used under over
or instead of foundation so we're going
to use it under today and just going to
apply it with my fingers see all not a
moisturizer actually I should probably
do okay I'm gonna go straight on top
with the Wonder glow it's like a sort of
quite liquidy I'm it's just like a beige
a page it's like a champagne gold cream
as you can see though smells fragrant
smells like lady perfume that makes
sense you know what you'd imagine
something like Chanel Dior my like okay
so it's not super glowy like it's just
add in like a really subtle luminosity
to the skin shall we say the I know
like I'm more interested in it actually
like Prime in Senate giving glow because
you can just add glow but I need a Prime
Minister Prime
thanks for foundation I've got the light
wonder youth boosters perfect skin
foundation this has SPF 15 it's been
like a similar bottle I got it in the
shade 6 medium so hopefully I'll match
my tanks that you have a little bit
perfect 100 minute
it says for daily luminous tint with SPF
15 blend a small amount onto your skin
from the nose outwards and for a muscle
is glowing finished tap on top of areas
where extra coverage is needed use an
uproar one thing I did invest in is the
foundation brush that Charlotte Tilbury
doors I didn't buy any of the other
brushes because I was just like no way
am i spending I mean I'm pretty sure
this contact 40 pounds for one brush
mmmmmm - it's like stiffer than I
expected it to be I'm assuming it's
natural hair I'm going to put it
straight on the brushes because that's
what I do with most foundations I have
to say I don't might use in white
foundation brushes because they just
make me so sad for any supplement
foundation and that's filthy before you
know it again smells really nice smells
a bit more like fresh if you know what I
mean I got this foundation brush is
 dreadful oh but you know when
you just like I feel like with a brush
and foundation you know in five seconds
if you like it or not and then I don't
know I don't know what that is
obviously I'm going to use a different
brush it's a little bit dirty but it's
only like God it's only been used once
used it like once yesterday and it was
clean before that so it shouldn't have
too much product in oh it's just so much
better already in my foundation itself
is like a perfect match
I don't usually nail foundation matches
as we all know color is lovely like it's
just really nice and bronzy quite on its
own as you can see like it's not too
it's not got any like orange in it or
anything if you know I mean it's
definitely like a light medium coverage
I would say it's weird because I
expected it for Nia because I don't know
I expected it to be quite sure
but it's not like as like sin and I
thought it was going to be if that make
sense like it's still kind of like
mousey in texture just gonna like start
building it up and see what happens
because obviously so this is like one
layer
luckily my skin is like behaving in a
minute so I don't really need like a ton
of coverage and I'm just going to try
and like build up because it said on the
bottle that you can kind of pop on areas
where you need extra coverage so I'm
going to give that a girl I love it so
far like it looks really lovely very
it's like a natural finish it's not
super luminous I would say in my opinion
just going to go over a little bit here
and try a patting motion and see how
that helps much prefer this brush to the
Charlotte Tilbury on some people are
going to be like oh my god didn't even
get a chance but I feel like the
foundation brush is you just know you
honestly know within five seconds you're
right now definitely buildable I mean
it's not giving like it's not full
coverage but I'd say it's like
definitely a solid medium coverage and
and it doesn't look cakey now that we've
put like a second layer on or anything
which is obviously a good thing I'm
learning recipes our nation I really
like it I didn't know if I worked
because obviously it's like and let the
formulas need to be a little bit more on
the natural side but I feel like for a
daytime foundation you can definitely
like build it to where you want it to be
anyway like you can definitely add
layers a bit and the combination we like
the primer underneath I feel like it
looks really lovely and very natural but
very flawless and like a brush at the
same time okay and then I did a
concealer this is the only concealer
that she does I believe or is the only
one that was on called PC because I did
get all this on court Beauty this is the
researcher conceal and treat stick I got
it in the shade too so it's not the
palest is the second penis yeah it's a
panic concealer which I didn't know if I
was going to like this because I don't
really tend to use pen concealers under
the eyes so I'm just going to set it
with translucent powder this is my RC
mas and a Laura Mercier table just
because I don't want to use the pressed
powder on my eyes I'm going to try that
on the rest of the skin
so I'm going to attempt to blend this
NPC line under the eyes and we'll see
where it takes us
obviously don't really know how much you
need what scene if I'm using a beauty
right now I'm just going to put a little
bit extra I can see all the hair under
my skin it's really gonna wake me up oh
girl oh oh my god that blended out so
easily like literally just melted into
the skin I'm really impressed tuna sex I
feel like this is a sort of concealer
that will crease although it's really
not salad in 20 fine lines so far which
is good on a tree like this could be a
new favorite concealer I'm not even
gonna lie and like so impressed with how
easy that I could live in its light in
saying that it's done in like that is so
stunning so full powder I've got the a
brush flawless finish and skin
perfecting micro powder this is in the
shade to medium and actually been
wanting to try this ever since I saw a
video that Kathleen like stood and where
she sort of went through like a bunch of
high-end makeup and said like if it was
worth the money or if it was not worth
the money and this is one of the things
that she really raised about and said
was really really good so I'm excited to
try this we're just going to use it to
accept the skin I always just like part
when I do powder like a goat um I don't
swipe when I do powder because I feel
like that can just remove product and
like remain foundation and stuff it kind
of just like gently mattified without
looking like overly dry it's a sort of
part of why I feel like you really don't
need a lot of it unless you want your
skin to be like quite matte and like
locked in and when it looks really nice
like my skin just looks I'm finna go and
do brows off-camera I'm not used in
Charlotte Tilbury products for those
just because this costume likes so much
anyway I was like I do not need more
brow products in my life so I'm going to
go and do those and I will be back with
you in a very slow on two eyes I've got
two different palettes and so the only
pilots that I could find that Charlotte
Cobra does I like the little quads which
is basically
looks like so if I can hold them up so
the outer packaging I think this is a
limited edition one product sparkles on
it and what it just looks like this and
then you open it up it's a mirror at the
start and it's got four eyeshadows at
the bottom so we've brought the dolce
vita palette and also the legendary
newest pallets and there's one that's
like more reds and red cards and then
this one's that more golds and bronzes
so the only thing that like and doesn't
concern me but maybe like confusing me a
little bit with you solace is there's no
matches in them I don't think like
there's just no much ease I saw like
every single eyeshadow in both of these
quads is a shimmer and so I'm probably
going to start with this sort of um this
like a rich reddish brown like chocolate
color up here it's got like tiny little
gold flecks in it and I'm going to use
this in the crease we'll see how it goes
we'll see how it goes and I've pretty
much just primer lids and then I set it
with the face powder that we use which
is why it looks a little bit orangey if
you can see that like I've not got an
eyeshadow on it's just face powder okay
so that is that color data so we felt
like it looks relatively matte on the I
let you can really see I need to like
specks of glitter in it so I'm gonna
start applying that same color
underneath the eyes I'm going to try and
like wrap it around the eye in just see
what happens
you're going to extend it here and try
and like create a cat shape so far the
blending like relatively well given the
circumstances we're only using one color
right now but winging it out past the
brow a little bit I just want it to be
quite like lifted and smokey what are we
thinking boys and girls I don't know I'm
going to start using this dark one and
try and mix this in a little bit as well
okay so I feel like it's slowly coming
together I cut this seems too much in
the sort of darker shade under my eye
like wrapping it around here you know it
was slowly getting some while I was
going to see I was really not looking
like cute under my eyes anymore
I might take back what I said
like it's really Kiki really Kiki how's
it going together I am quite like that
the shadows just do take like a little
bit of work I would say so there's like
I'm relatively happy with it now and
considerably only used to shave like I
feel like it's come out really well and
they did take a little bit more blending
I'm not going to lie and I do still wish
I was like something in there to help
them blend because maybe that's like
what they needed but like if you've got
the time to spend like sit in and blend
in and buy only as they are good shadows
and they look really pricey okay so I'm
just going to finish off with this shade
on the lid it's just like a really
beautiful gold copper and then I'm going
to use the paler shade in the palette to
highlight the inner corner and the brow
bone and we shall see how that goes okay
so that is the finished shallow look
with all four colors and I do really
like it now and I can't remember how
much the palette was I feel like it's
about 38 pounds or so which before
eyeshadow I was like personally I
wouldn't say they're like worth it
unless you're like a lover of makeup and
you want to invest in a Charlotte silver
palette I don't really have like
anything black to say about there and I
just say like it's fairly standard and
you can probably get fatter and similar
things the money I'm not gonna lie all
right so for mascara we've got the
legendary lashes this is just a mini
version and because it came in a little
what did I comment on a Christmas that
where it had like a mini liner and a
mini mascara so your neck your back oh
I'm going to give that a go it just
looks like so in the smaller packaging
which is just enough you know what you
just like me like pokey tells me I have
mascara that was me okay so mascara is
on and it builds really well it's not
like too clumpy or anything like that
definitely adds like a lot of length and
a lot of definition I would say okay so
back onto face we've just got contour
highlight and then lips today without a
cause for contour and highlight I had to
pick up these on start burns and glow
and face and sculpt highlight so this
just looks like so I got the shade I
think this is a shade light I'm pretty
sure there's only two shades in it and
the darker one looked really quite dark
and so it's just got a console like a
slope shade that and then a highlight
shade here I feel like out of
in Charlotte celebrate this is the one
thing that's always really raved about
so I'm excited to try it okay definitely
saleable which is nice
blends really well on the skin like it
kind of just feels like nothing going on
your skin needs like the biggest size
that's what I had actually because I
have a five-person sort of cooldown
there's not really any orange in it or
anything it just looks nice and
structured and I like it we don't try
the highlight shade which is the one on
the right so I'm just gonna get
whoo-whoo okay whoo that's pretty I just
said I expected that to be like more on
the natural side like I didn't expect it
to be that blinding but Jesus us laughs
okay and then all we have it left to do
is lips so the lip liner that I got is
in the shade pillow top because I feel
like this is whenever anyone mentions
like a Charlotte Tilbury lip liner it's
usually this one so I wanted to give it
a go because it looks like a really
lovely nude and then I've got a bunch of
lipsticks and losses so we're going to
choose one in a minute okay so it feels
really waxy like really waxy for a lip
liner it definitely needs some like
working with and some apply in if that
makes sense like it's not like when I
use my Mac lip liners on my Rimmel lip
liners where the color payoff is like
one two three and you're done
and when it's kind of nice in a sense
because it allows you to really like do
a good shape and it makes sure that if
you say your hand slips a little bit
which mine does sometimes when I do lip
liner it means that because there's not
like tons of color payoff like it
doesn't do a massive line that you don't
want if that makes sense it gives you a
little bit more control and then in
terms of lipstick I do have a good few
but the one that I really want to try is
Kim page all you because I feel like
this was just raved about like I saw
this in so many favorites videos not so
long ago so I bought it because everyone
raves about it and I'm going to try it
myself yeah reminds me like creme Cup my
markets definitely got like a pink tone
to it so I'm just going to pop that on
my lips oh it smells like vanilla smells
really good
lovely and creamy it feels really sick
and like far me on the lips which I like
kind of like a satin finish I would say
it's not matte but it's not got any like
glitter or any like shimmer or anything
like that in it just like a nice sort of
glassy satin finish okay and then I
brought two lip glosses because they
both looked stunning so the first one is
in IB tonight and it's probably the one
I'm going to use today it looks like me
and a glass like I'm so excited to use
this and we try and show you what it
looks like just like you can see the
shimmer and like how it reflects in the
light and then the other one is in the
shade blondie and it's similar but it's
just like more of a pink tone like so
because this like nude is already so
pinky and I'm going to go in with a more
like muted one which is IBC notes and
we're going to give that a go ah I love
it okay what I'm going to do because one
thing that books me when there's
applicators like this and it's like a
pale glass is when you swatch it on your
lips it like stains the applicators so
if I ever have a gloss that's like that
pale I just like take the applicator and
I like scoop the gloss that on my hand
and then I just apply it with my fingers
instead because it stops it getting like
to contaminate even like changing the
color of the gloss if you know I need
that is so proof to you like this little
mo I love it okay so this is the
finished look I really hope you all
found this useful and found it
interesting to watch let me know in the
comments if you tried any of these
products yourself because I would love
to know your thoughts on them as well
and I'm going to point out a few of the
things that I think are my favorites all
the things I would definitely like
invest some money in so the school and
glow clear I'm really impressed with and
I didn't think that it was going to be
as good as it is in the sense of like
the sculpt shade isn't super dark and
but it kind of works nice but it's kind
of like a bit fairer than all the
sculpting parties I have because it
means you can build it up and the
highlight start suit yourself the light
wonder foundation I think is really
lovely it's kind of just like a nice
daytime foundation but it definitely
still gives you like a good amount of
coverage in my opinion so I
really like that and I'm not the biggest
fun at the concealer anymore kind of
gone a bit cakey under the eye so I
might try it in a different video and
try and set it differently because it
looks fine before we powdered it so it
might be the powder I'm not sure and the
powder
I don't like mustard Lyrae I don't know
like my paws in this area look a little
bit bigger than usual and I don't know I
just feel like it's a powder like I love
Rimmel stay matte I love mac mineralize
and that obviously like a fraction of
the price so I wouldn't like I probably
won't buy this again like I'll still try
out and like use it a couple more times
before I perform up a solid opinion but
it's not blown me away I shadows I do
really like but obviously for the
quarter like for a tiny little quad like
this it is pricey so again maybe not
something to invest money and maybe you
want to get something like similar
that's a more affordable brand or like
five for makeup geek eyeshadows because
there would be a fraction of the price
and in my opinion make a week I like the
bath all the lip products I really like
I feel like they're just drawn in
especially all together as well they
worked really well so the liner the
lipstick and the glass I definitely
recommend I think less fab mascara it
looks nice but like a mascara mascara to
me I'd rather like go and pick something
up some boots in my opinion for just
really all do the same thing and people
usually smell the wounded glow I just I
don't know it's a bit like me if you not
I mean like it's nice but it's not again
it's not something that I would like
necessarily invest money into I'd rather
buy the foundation the mission just use
a different primer because I have so
many primers that are just like good
primers and necessarily drunk cost as
much as this one so I think that was
pretty much it so let me know easing in
the comments like I said if you've tried
anything from Charlotte Tilbury lucky
boobs any of these products let me know
your thoughts because obviously
everything is going to work definitely
for different people as well so I would
love to know thank you so much for
watching I love you guys to mute and
back and I will see you in Saturday's
video because there's a sneaky video on
Saturday as well as Sunday there you go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
