background today I don't know I don't
know I felt like a different background
follow me on snapchat you will see me
ramble in the other night about how I
just like don't feel like myself on
youtubes minute I feel like I've just
not uploaded for the past week because
I've been filming videos and I just
haven't liked them assholes or basically
trying to like mix things up a little
bit from filming in natural daylight
which is why I always used to do when I
did my like chat videos and things
rather than with like the artificial
light so I'm sat in the living room with
natural daylight just as a camera and
we're going to see how it goes and for
today's video is going to be another
sort of like ebay balloon so the other
week I did a test in eBay fakes video
and you all seem to love it so I wanted
to do and another one that I've seen a
couple of people doing so I basically
bought a bunch of Sookie knees and some
suits of eBay all of them are under five
talents I think the majority was for
pound 99 and I basically wanted to do
like a little mini haul of the stuff
that I picked up and the stuff that I
found and also try them on so that you
can see what they look like because
again I feel like stuff that's so
affordable especially on sites like eBay
I've always got such good photos of
these bikinis and it just makes you
think like how on earth is this a fiber
like how so
I ever had to try them on and tell you
if I think they're worth the money or if
I think they record if they're like a
true representation of the images and
stuff I will link all the bikinis I got
down below in case you do and agony and
I have already tried them on because I
wanted to be able to like chat to you
about what I think of them after I tried
them on I'm finding out into it so I
wanted to get like a range of colors and
stuff and like a range of like styles so
this is a white one it's kind of hard to
show because it's a multi-way so
basically both too close I'll also like
insert photos of what they look like in
the picture so that you can see as well
to be honest like I don't remember
ordering a multi-way one so this is I
don't know I don't know where this it
come from so this is the bottom half
it's really high it's like really high
rise on the brief section so this is
what goes around your vajayjay Q fairy
cuz it's so high rise like it just went
straight up my bum crap I'm going to be
completely honest I went straight off
the graph kind of had this cute bit at
the back which sort of like folds over
like so and then it's just multi way
straps so they kind of like rough around
and then you just hide them how you want
and it feels really nice if
very soft but it's so thin obviously
I've not liked walnuts as a bikini yet
so I don't know what it's like when you
get it wet but especially with it being
white like I would not wear this in
swimsuit 100% I wanted and also because
like the actual brief section it doesn't
have like you know it's like in bikinis
and swimsuits like the bottom section it
has an area where your actual like
vajayjay it's like sick and it's like
double layered and it's kind of just
more you feel better in it because it's
just like thicker material it has none
of that like it's so thin and that is
what the brief section is like there so
you can see like you can see my thumb
through that can you imagine
but I would not wear this is a swimsuit
like I just would not feel taking it
whatsoever I just feel so exposed so
that was the first one
what should I try on next oh my gosh
this was the worst one right this is
what I tried on next okay so I got this
this is not something I would ever
really wear myself but I got it because
it was a completely different style to
the rest of them okay I've lost a part
to it basically it's a bikini and this
is the top part which it looks lovely
when you're just looking at there and I
thought okay this could be a good one
and then I tried it on oh my gosh okay
so it's got these parts in it but I like
obviously few boobies but you can just
see straight through them like the kind
that they're actually gonna be able to
see you can definitely see him to try on
as soon as I put it on I looked in the
mirror I was like oh my god it looks
nothing like the photo you can't really
see before you try it on and but this is
like the top half it's basically just a
bundle and then it's also got it comes
with two little arm sleeves which just
go on your upper arms like that and then
it also has a choker as well which I
don't know the choke is gone I've lost
it yeah it has these little arm sleeves
that you basically just pop them and
they sit like a disco fever arm so it's
kind of like the effect is like a
Bardot's tall actual choker that came
with it which is just the same it's just
the same material in the same style it's
just striking pink and white and it just
goes running out absolutely huge massive
and then the bottoms are just standard
like bikini bottoms these were fine but
to be honest like the whole top part
slapped it down so this is one that I'm
just going right up like I'm not going
to use it and then I'm pretty sure I did
this car key one neck so this again is a
bikini and I love the style of this and
I'm seeing this style of bikini
everywhere emanates like high waist like
super high waist breeze and then just
like a bundle top so this is what the
briefs look like they had this in like
so many different colors we had it like
black we have it in like a bright orange
I think we had Y and like pinks and
stuff as well but I got cocky because
personally I love coffee green and so
these are what the bottoms look like as
you can see they're huge because they
are designs we like high waist and again
they're quite high leg which I like like
I like a bracelet high-rise on the leg
because I feel like it looks quite
flattering on my figure for some reason
I don't really know it does have more
fabric like as you can see the bomb half
has a lot more fabrics and what the
white multi way has so it doesn't it
doesn't like go trouble as much the only
thing I didn't like about these is they
weren't as high-waisted as I wanted to I
swear I can never find self that affects
my torso
about like you all know as well the
issues that I have with body foods I
didn't think I had a long torso but
clearly I do because nothing is like
long enough ever on the source of such
as minutes so when I am yeah they look
really cute they're a nice color of
khaki again it got like the seams and
stuff all the way around each section
the thing that I liked about this as
well like it comes with a little tag
none of the others came with a tag and
it actually just have like a profit
section and it has the hygiene stickers
are which most which pretty much all
bikinis and swimsuits should have so
that when you try them on because they
fly obviously when you try it on if you
don't want it the hiding thing is silver
so you can send it Barlow it was a
breeze and then the actual bandeau top
again I feel like this was made quite
well because it's got padding in it and
well it looser but it's not like the
pink one where you can see the packet in
like to put it on and it looks
absolutely fine I think out of all of
them this is the one that I would be
most likely to wear as a swimsuit and it
just felt quite comfy on I got this in a
medium I doesn't have been seen what
sizes I got I'm pretty sure I got
everything in a medium and maybe a
couple of things in a small I'll put in
the description bar with the links what
size I got the next one I tried on to be
honest this is joint worst with the pink
in the white one because it is just
absolutely massive
I'm pretty sure this is the only one I
got in a small and it's huge so this
again is a white swim - it's a different
style it's like got actual straps that
like set straps it's not like a
multi-way or anything
oh my god my leg is on fire quite
Natalya
it's like bruising so badly anyway so
it's a v-neck and this whole section I
mean you can probably tell already is
massive absolutely massive like it's
just so long like the shops are so long
this is why I don't always like buying
swimsuits that have set straps because I
just think it's so risky like when it
gets here it's better to have something
that ties that you can adjust if you not
I mean yeah the whole top section is
massive and then it basically has this
section in the middle which is kind of
like cutouts and which again is a little
bit different to some of the other stuff
that I picked up which is why I've got
it yeah it's a small it's a friggin
small and it's the biggest one and I
remember when I tried it on it does
nothing for my figure because it's so
big I think doesn't hug me in any of the
places that something would usually help
me like you'll be able to see when I
tried to other stuff on it just doesn't
look good on my figure and it doesn't
like hug anything the way I want it to
it just looks wrong here to know from me
so I and then the last one is a red one
because as I said I wanted to get like
different styles and colors and stuff so
again this is a swimsuit
first of all I love the color of red
like it's just a really fun like bright
red I don't usually wear red but I feel
like on holiday and still for swimsuit
it's really lovely and it basically has
adjustable straps which is nice to just
tie it around the back of your neck and
it basically has like a bunch of mesh
and stuff down the side so it just has
different types of like mesh panels and
things and then it just goes into the
swimsuit and I tried this on I honestly
thought this was going to be really
promising but then I had the same issue
that I have with all like my frigging
body suits swimsuit anything it was too
short on the saucer like it was it it
was so sure it wasn't even like I was
hoping that I could maybe pull it up a
little bit so it was higher on like the
brief section and came a little bit more
and when it gave me more room for like
my torso and like my chest area but I
don't know for some reason like this
just wouldn't pull up over my legs I
don't have it which is too tight and it
won't go of my palm and but it just
didn't feel right like it felt so
uncomfortable did manage to tie up
obviously you'll see like in the Tryon
clip and but it just I think I liked it
because it was like so sure like it
really just came quite low on my chest
area and I just wouldn't feel like super
comfortable wearing that if you're a
little bit shorter than me I'm 5 foot
soon and then this might be a winner for
you because there is good material as
well as it feels good like it feels good
policy and everything is covered quite
well so I would be comfortable wearing
this like all of the areas that you want
covered like your boobies individual J's
and it's all covered in it's all quite
thick material so you feel quite safe in
it so it's just a shame because I feel
like this would have been the best one
if it fit right so those were all of the
bikinis that I picked up as I said I'll
link them all down below in case you
want to try it on yourself as I said
they are only four pounds 99 so I feel
like even though the majority of them
are just not for me
like it's not it's not like a huge waste
of money you know I mean it's like 25
pounds for all sides and let me know
what you think give this video a massive
thumbs up if you enjoyed it and let me
know what other videos you want me to do
because as I said like I feel like I'm
just in a weird age with my channel a
minute like I don't really know what
direction I want to go in and but if
you've got any suggestions and I am all
is that we know what you think of this
little background going on as well like
whether you like it or not I feel like
this is more so me basically the issue
is I can't film with natural daylight in
my bedrooms like I would used to and I
like home in my old house and because
the way the room is like the natural
daylight doesn't fall right so like my
bed set up if that makes sense whereas
in my old bedroom it did and so this is
kind of like the only place really where
I can like sit and use natural daylight
in the living room so let me know what
you think and if you like it then I'll
carry on doing videos here because I
quite like it anyway I'm going to go
because I'm actually just chatting
so I hope you enjoyed this video and I
will see you in next one and I love you
to the moon boxes always ahh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
