to be another test in a clothing brand
video because you guys really seem to
enjoy in the Romney one that I did I
think it's pronounced Romney after that
you know but today we have a really
exciting brand it's gonna be a fashion
at Nova which I have seen so much about
fashion no but I've heard really mixed
opinions on them and I just went on the
website and I really love the vibe of a
lot of the stuff they had so for me it
looks really promising so I was really
excited about this one you've got any
questions about anything I mention not
anything I show in this video let me
know and I will leave it links to
everything so cool okay I have like a
pile of clothes and it's just gone okay
so I'm quickly gonna start with this
right because this is the only piece of
clothing that does not have a try on
clay okay so this is like a high neck
jumper I was like okay this will be
really cute for winter time you know
nice and cozy things like that I love
the style of it by the way I'm just
gonna say that right now I love the way
it looks I love the material it's nice
and thick well oh my god this stinks
I genuinely want to put this on to film
the clip this was like maybe the second
thing that I tried on and as soon as I
like put my head inside the drum bar
I was like nope not today honestly
concept Lake it smells so bad
okay even it's so bad I went nuts s my
mom and I was like mom smell this jump
out and tell me that I'm not going crazy
mom agreed it smells like a piece of
 I mean it's nothing crazy but it
just smells really bad of like sweat if
I'm gonna be honest which at first we
were like we can't work out if it was
the material because you know when you
got like wooly jumper sometimes and they
sometimes just have like a really weird
smell and they like need a first wow so
this is 100% acrylic it's actually kind
of wash only I don't know cuz I smell
like if I smell the outside it's fine it
still smells a bit weird what it smells
like what I would expect this kind of
material to smell like where it's on the
inside it smelled like sweat oh that's a
bit disappointing I don't know if anyone
else got jump like this or like this
jumper in particular let me know yeah
that's the first thing really great
style
okay I'm do something more positive and
these are a pair of jeans so I feel like
fashion Oba is really known for kind of
cater into curvy figures and stuff when
it comes to jeans I feel like a lot of
girls well I'm not a lot of girls but
some girls have issues sometimes with
jeans fitting in the right places like
fitting in terms of hips and waist and I
found in the past sometimes not
time but every now and then I'll
struggle to get like a pair of jeans
over my bum but then once they are there
just like too big on the way so I'm
always like in between sizes it's really
difficult to pick a size so I was really
excited to try these on and I have to
say they did fit really well so the
sizing is a bit confusing and I've got a
size 5 and I just use like the size
guide on the website these are like blue
mid wash jeans and they've got little
rips in them they're gonna I swear to
god there's a ghost in this
radio I'm not even joking what was that
that's like the third time that's
happened I just filmed another video and
it just happened that I rewind it if you
didn't just hear that okay that was my
speaker and it just comes on randomly
and then goes off and it scares the
out of me ya know the skinny jeans they
had like a bunch different styles and
stuff but I really like them they fit
really well they were nice and high
waisted and they fit perfectly on the
waist as well which is always a plus I
feel like the secrets of jeans like that
is just having a long as it whenever
jeans have a long zip I always know but
I'm gonna love them because it kind of
gives you the room to go over your bond
with and you can zip them up on the
waist they were at $43 by the way which
for a good pair of jeans I think is a
good price and then I also got some
fleece leggings because I can never have
too many leggings I just live in them
and again I struggle to find leggings
that are like not see-through or just
like fit right and kind of stay off and
stuff like that but I was really again
pleasantly surprised by these and not
fashion Nova brand that's the only thing
like some other things I found in here
and not fashion Nova brand it's like
they bought them in and which I know
brands do sometimes I'm sure like boohoo
and things like like friends like that
do that as well and it's not like a
problem but it's just something to bear
in mind so these are actually by a brand
called software
adesh no but they are fleece leggings
are genuinely fleece on the inside they
are so soft which I'm so glad I found
these in time in time before winter
because I always love a good part of
comfy leggings and they fit perfectly
they went on perfectly then nice and
high-waisted as well which I like okay
this top is so cute this is like the
only t-shirt top that I got it's just a
little Navy top and it's got these kind
of details around the neck and the
sleeve so it's kind of like thoughtfully
and it says kind of hair kind of dome
which is you know start my life so I got
this in a size small and this was $15
which I
is there a really good price for a top
that's like what 12 ish pounds and it's
just a little crop top I really love the
colored navy at the minute I don't know
what it is but I'm just really going
into the color Navy now that it's like
wintertime fit really well really soft
and comfy it's a little bit thin but
it's nothing crazy and then I got three
body suits because one thing I do like
to test where the clothing runs is the
quality of their body suits because if
any of you have watched my channel from
Ohio you all know I struggle to find
body suits that are long enough on the
body like I don't even feel like I have
a particular long buddy but I don't know
a lot of the time they're just not long
enough so the first one is just a plain
black body suit it's kind of like a
t-shirt a fact I'm just like a black
v-neck admit it's got a little black
cuffed sleeve it's a size small and it
was $18 and it is again really nice
quality it's a bit thinner and so it is
a little bit safe where you will see in
the clay either way I do really like it
and it's nice and long boys and girls it
don't suffocate my vagina and then we've
got another v-neck this is a gray one
rib material a second knitted kind of
ripped situation and I got this in a
small I got pretty much everything in a
small this one was a little bit more
expensive it was $20 I don't like this
one as much because I feel like the
bottom detail looks a little bit like
cheap on it and I don't know if it's
just me but I think it's because it's
white like if it was gray I think I
prefer it more but there's just
something about like the white buttons
it just looks a bit like cheap to me and
then what else have we got this is the
last one this is a banjo and out of all
of them this is probably the shortest on
the body but that's also probably
because it is a bundle and it's got no
straps so you kind of just have to rely
on like key boobies to like keep it
whole but this one was $20 again so the
same price is the gray one and I did get
it in small and I tried it on without a
bra as well because that's always a test
for me with like stuff that you usually
can't I mean he could wear like a
strapless bra with this but I prefer not
to
and it wasn't see-through or anything
like that it fit really nicely and I did
feel like comfortable in it yeah I
really like this one it doesn't you pull
it off a little bit more but I feel like
with bundles anyway I'm constantly like
I think that's just me I don't know if
that can constantly just like pulling
them up then I decided to get a
two-piece because and they have a
selection on the website that's like the
Kylie section because I'm pretty sure
Kylie Jenner does a lot of like brand
deals and sponsorships and stuff with
fashion Nova
I do really like kylie jenner's styles
so I thought I would go to the little
top and check out what they've got so I
don't think this is something that she's
like exactly war on but it's something
similar so what she's alone if you know
I mean so it's a Jersey two-piece as you
probably just seen the first part is
obviously the top so this is just a long
sleeve jerseys top it's got like a
little lace up situation going on again
I tried this on without a bra and it was
absolutely fine you could wear it with a
brown as well though obviously because
it is like lace-up and it's got a cute
little hood as well which I always like
a good hood I don't know why I just know
really cozy know this was $25 and again
I got it in a small and I really love
the top but I'm not as much of a fan of
the leggings so I'm too those bad boys
these are nice because obviously the
same material and stuff they're a little
bit see-through first of all but I mean
it's not as bad because they are like
it's almost like a patent gray like a
textured gray if you know what I mean so
you don't really like your eyes and as
drawn to it as much if it was just a
flat color if you're not I mean ears
were $25 again and again I got them in a
small I just wish they were more
high-waisted it's a personal preference
thing it's not like a thing to do with
the product as such but I just wish they
were more high-waisted because I just
felt myself as I was trying them on like
trying to pull them up more and they
just wouldn't go up more if you know I
mean I probably wear this around the
house and stuff for like a comfy thing
but I wouldn't wear it owl okay and then
onto your jumper that didn't smell like
 so this is a really fluffy white
little jumper situation again I just
thought this was so perfect for like
Christmas and winter time so this is
around it's kind of a similar style to
the first one that I showed you that I
don't have a turn clip for and but this
is a size small and it was $30 and it's
basically just like yeah a round neck a
cropped jumper only thing with this one
is like it was too cropped for me so
literally like I put it on and it just
about cover my boobs but if I was to
like lift my arms or anything for
whatever reason like it would just be
you know all out so that's the only
thing but yeah it's just a bit too short
for me because literally you can't raise
your arms right then it's like okay so
again these are like not a fashion Nova
brand because they're not tagged fashion
Nova they're actually tagged
high five high five high five made in
China
don't know if they do that with a lot of
stuff it's got like a completely
different tack on as well it's not got
the price on they much just like I don't
know buy this stuff is like wholesale
and then sell it on the website I don't
know how it works these are like green
khaki pants I loved the way they were
styled on the website and I've been on
the hunt for some like this for a while
I kind of just like really soft kind of
like satin and then they just cuff at
the bottom and there's like a little
waistband and things like that to tie at
the waist these are really nice okay but
my issue again is that they're not
high-waisted enough like the crotch is
like so small I'm like come on let me
pull them up some more I don't know what
it adds but the length between the top
and like the crotch is just really small
like it's really tight I probably will
put these on D part which if I don't
wants to know my deep pop is just I'm
extranet yeah cuz I feel like someone
will really love these and I do really
love them but they just don't fit my
buddy quite right which is annoying
okay this cheeky monkey I was so excited
about because if you watch my wrongly
runway no you will know that I bought a
black jumpsuit from there because I've
been constantly on the horn for the
perfect Jersey black jumpsuit and it
definitely was not the one that I had in
that hole okay make me look like a sack
of potatoes so yeah they had ratings on
each item which for me is really
important like I love that misguided do
that now I really need pretty little
thing to do that because it just gives
you an idea and like obviously someone
else's bought it and you know they can
tell you like how it fits them depending
on their body shape and give a review
and like the quality of the product I
just think it's so handy and this had
really good reviews so I was really
excited it's you pick it up and I have
to say I do really like it
the only thing it's a little bit
see-through which kind of breaks my
heart but I don't know I'm sure there's
ways to like work around it I'll just
have to wear like nude underwear or some
man with me perfectly it hooked me in
all the places that I wanted it to hook
me and stuff and it just looked and felt
really nice and it's what I wanted you
know okay we have a dress and I thought
I got in fact do you know what I did
actually autumn lost off than this but
they emailed me after I placed the order
basically saying really sorry but some
of the stuff wasn't in stock so they've
given me a gift card instead which I
really appreciate because I'm gonna
obviously
but I swear like you should refund what
isn't in stock money with money if you
not I mean anyway moving on I think I
got a couple more justice than this but
they wouldn't stop for whatever reason
so this is the only one I've got to
share with you so this is the Sugar Land
satin dress I did want a different
version of this but it wasn't in stock I
was so sad
I got this one in a small and it was $33
do you know what I really like the dress
but it just doesn't flatter my body
asshole it's like the bottom line with
this it's really nice that in a really
nice color so again I'll either send
this back will pop up send it back or
put it on it depart for someone who
wants it and because it is a really nice
dress it's very fast averse well it's
like kind of this nice burgundy color
and it's got like wide sleeves which is
quite a style at the minute kind of like
bell sleeves and then it just kind of
wraps around and it goes into a dress
for me first of all it's just like a
little bit short for my liking and and
the chest area is just a bit too big
like I just don't feel like I can fill
it to be honest it's not gonna laughs
okay last jumper I love this it's so
cozy so this is a crop jumper it was $23
and again it's in a small and this is
just a burgundy jumper and it says vibes
I actually pick this up because it was
paired with the bunny fur not the bunny
suit the jump to that I just showed like
the old black body kind of jumpsuit and
the model had this over top and I just
love the way it looks like it just
looked really cool and like cozy the one
thing I will say is this is really big
for a small I think so in terms of the
sleeves and stuff it's kind of fine and
but the actual like jumper is just
massive like there's so much material I
can't quite explain it I try and show it
a lot of it in the clip so that you can
see but I will say that if you're gonna
order this and you want it to be like
I'm not necessarily more fitted because
it's not exactly a fitted piece but if
you just want it to be more to like true
to size maybe get a size down like I
don't mind cuz I like stuff oversized
yeah those are all the bits and bobs I
got from fashion Nova overall I would
say and the shopping experience on the
website was fab I really liked the
layout and stuff it was really easy to
shop in terms of shipping the shipping
took longer than expected and there were
Costin fees I believe or whether a few
cookies should say Hartmann because I
wanted like all the stuff from America
at a similar time I'm gonna do another
order so I'll let you know about customs
then but yeah in terms of the quality of
the clothes definitely feel like there
are majority of them a good quality and
majority of them I kind of like true to
size and true to what they look like on
the website which is obviously really
important part from that jumper that I
showed first off I don't know what I'm
gonna do with that I'm gonna show you
washrooms just hope for the baths and
but if you've got any questions then
obviously let me know but other than
that thank you so much for watching let
me know what Browns what other clothing
brands you want in these videos in the
comments I love you see them in a back
all right I'll see you in the next one
