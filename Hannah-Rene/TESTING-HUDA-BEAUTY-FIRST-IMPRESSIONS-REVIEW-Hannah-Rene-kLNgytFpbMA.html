going to be a testing video because I
feel like it's been a hot second since I
did the last one we've got a really
exciting friend today as well today
we're going to be testing hood up beauty
or huda beauty depending on how you say
it I have literally not really tried a
lot from this brand I've tried
one of the palettes like the first large
palette that she brought out which I
can't remember the name of I've only
used it like once or twice and I feel
like she's got a good selection of
products now to try out so we've got the
primer foundation brush the sort of like
3d highlighter kits eyeshadows lashes
all sorts like stuff that I've literally
never tried before so I'm really excited
about this one because it's not like a
full range of products I'm just gonna
test the stuff on camera and then things
that aren't in the kind of like
collection like bronzers and things like
that I am gonna do off camera just to
save a little bit of time we just talked
about my little Santa earrings as well
can you even tell that the Centers I
feel like from now you can't and but
when I'm back here they probably just
look like darks like anyway yeah I'm
gonna get straight into it so I'm gonna
go ahead and do brows and eyes off
camera because the first product that we
have got to try moving girls it's one of
the mini obsessions so this is the more
obsessions which looks like so in size
so we're gonna be using this for
eyeshadow today I asked on Twitter a
long time ago if you wanted me to use
this one or the large palette which I
can trim the name of for the life of me
and a lot of you voted for these little
cheeky monkies so we're gonna use that
today so I'll be right back okay brows
and eyes are done like eyes are primed
you know what I mean so I'm gonna start
with this color in the middle which is
kind of like a neutral Brown transition
only used um how do Beauty eyeshadows
once and it was like what is that
palette called it's like the first big
palette that she has with all the foiled
ones as well
like I remember I'm gonna go out later
anyway um but I wasn't like blown away
like for some reason they just didn't
blend very well on my eyes so I'm hoping
that these ones are gonna work a little
bit better can't believe it's actually
five days until Christmas now like
honestly where has the egg on I finally
done all my Christmas shopping though so
I'm feeling organized should we go in in
fact y'all go in with another crease
color first
gonna go in with this shade down here
and use him in the crease on top
ya know Christmas is hands-down my
favorite time of year like the food the
movies the music buying presents like I
love Christmas shopping I love buying
presents for people feel like at
Christmas it's like the one chance you
have every year to kind of treat
everyone at the same time if you know
what I mean like birthdays you just kind
of well just like one person's birthday
I don't if that makes any sense
so my like cytosol because today's
Wednesday some Holdings like film and
oklet upload this on the same day
because I've got a hole for tomorrow and
I feel like I'm doing so many holes at
the minute that I'm trying to like break
it up with other stuff in between
but December is like the month of holes
I swear so I've got one tomorrow and
then one for boxing day on which will be
next Tuesday yes today's Wednesday and
then tomorrow
o Kane finishes work today for the year
obviously so tomorrow we've booked a
hotel in Manchester and we're gonna go
see like the Christmas markets and stuff
because I'm pretty sure tomorrow is like
the last day that they're open and I've
not been this year I'm not being at all
like I've not done any shopping they're
not gonna have like any food or drinks
there so we're going to do that tomorrow
and then on Friday morning when we check
out of the hotel and we're gonna drive
to one of the cabins that we stayed in
this year which is like up north yeah
we're going to one of the cabins that we
stayed in this year and we're gonna take
toffee which is like Kane's dog in case
no one's seen ow and I'm just so excited
like I just feel like that's such a cute
way to like and the year do you know I
mean like I love stuff like that I love
little trips away and then I'm gonna oh
what am I gonna do I'm gonna mix this
shade in fact let's just use it by
itself is to see what it's like so I'm
gonna use this shade and I'm using it on
a backstage Beauty Blender brush ya know
I love little jokes away like long
drives sat in the car listening to
Christmas music I just love stuff like
that mm-hmm
that is nice like it's pigmented but
it's not super pigmented which I kind of
like if you're not I mean because
there's like no fallout at all no no
what
doing with this color I think I'm just
gonna let you drag it out a little bit
but yeah what's everyone doing for
Christmas like how do you spend
Christmas because I feel like some
people like all of their family got
together which we do sometimes but not
often and then some people just have
like really quiet like small Christmases
which is what we're doing this year it's
just gonna be me mum dad and Charlie and
then I'm gonna what I'm gonna go over
top with this shade down here none of
these have names by the wakes it's just
like a little little mini and so this
one is like I'm more kind of like
purpley burgundy Cola ooh nice so far
yeah I didn't this purple shading cuz I
don't want it to be too pink like I'd I
don't mind purple on my eyes but I'm not
like a fan of pink
I'm not found a pink eye so where did
you go halo eye actually because I'm not
doing one of those in a while so I'm
just gonna take like all the darker
shades again on a Sigma e45 which is
just like a tapered blending brush I'm
just gonna pop them there and then oh
what should we use on the lid there's
like a few different shimmery ones so
we've got these two here and then this
wine mmm I don't know maybe I'll use
this one I'm just gonna put that on the
middle center of the lid you again I've
never tried how to be T it lashes before
so I'm really excited to try these I
have to say the reason I've never tried
them is because I look at them and they
just don't appeal to me I'm that foaming
which is obviously really cool so they
like cruelty free and stuff but it's
just like this style like the way the
lashes like layered and stuff they these
are the style JT I don't never said that
number 13 they kind of remind me of what
iconic SAR by house of lashes which I
used to love but now I kind of prefer
fluttery lashes so I'm gonna give them a
go and hopefully they'll look okay they
are kind of like wings they're a little
bit longer at the ends which is good
because that's like my kind of lash
that was so easy to apply because the
last run is just like so thin so that is
what they look like on and not my
favorite lash I've ever won if I'm going
to be like 100 cent is but they don't
look bad I feel like when I was
measuring them against my lashes like I
thought that they were gonna look just
shitty on um but now that they're
actually on they do look quite nice for
some reason this one looks better than
this one why is it just me it's probably
just me being like weird but anyway yeah
I'm gonna move on to skin so like I said
I've got the primer and the foundations
try it out and I've got the brush as
well so the primer comes in a little
tube like so this is called the
complexion perfection a pre makeup base
and it came in this little carton like
cardboard carton as well what does it
say a lot of stuff that is not in
English okay so say anything oh yeah it
says directions apply dime sized amount
to the face using fingers or a dense
brush can be used alone or as a pre
makeup base for a hydrating skin and
smoothing effect I'm paired with the
foundation of course so we'll start with
darks it said a dime sized amount which
oh it's thick oh it smells nice so I've
used probably like three pumps there
that's done my whole face so this is the
foundation I'm really excited to try
this what was I gonna say Rachel has
already used this on me when we did our
like makeovers for our channels and
stuff with Col beauty and so I've worn
it on my skin but I've not used it
myself and I didn't see her apply it so
it looked nice on my skin but obviously
she used different base products and
things like that so we're gonna see how
it looks today and how I find a plane in
things black there so this is a
different shade to Rachel's as well
Rachel's was a lot darker this one is
the shade of butter pecan we've got the
brush here as well this is the hata
beauty face blend buff and brush so I'm
just gonna get this owl I have to say
I've not been using a buffing brush
raised as much as I used to so I'm
either gonna love this or hate there I
like the size of it like it's really big
so just like gets the job at donut quick
the brush that I've been using recently
for foundation is the look see angled
large angled brush which I don't know if
you can see what the bristles are like
they kind of spread out like it's not
like dense so it's just really good for
like whipping stuff on what does this
say does it have any where's the buck
Scott and let me just read it quickly
use a pump or lass apply foundation
evenly all over the face with a dense
brush or a beauty sponge power with the
hood up you see also it says a pump all
last likes okay so I'm gonna do one pump
I hate this one you've got them like it
oh ok so right that is one pond and a
little bit because a little bit came out
before our full con bill did this online
so if the colors wrong don't come for me
it's so hard to order foundation online
because the shade is just never quite
right we're gonna go with it which
smells good smells like tropical ok so
that one pump is pretty much covered
that I would say which is like the low I
have my face I have to say a lot of it I
don't know if you can see but a lot of
it is like stocking the brush is a
little bit annoying um but you know it's
still got a fair way the cool is not
that bad it's just a little bit more
yellowy like all of you there my tiniest
the brush is nice like it's given a
really nice finish I am on my forehead
I'm gonna try my look so you want just
to see if it makes any difference and
see like how if the product goes any
further which it should do oh yeah can
you see like how much more product that
has given off like I've not even taken
the full pomp I've just taken like half
of their say the applications pretty
similar if anything it's way heavier on
my forehead because this product that
this brush applied so much more of the
foundation and a little bit to all of
y'all though we for me so I'm just gonna
blend some down the NAP this brush is
taking the product way further than what
the hood of beauty brush they're like
I've pretty much done my whole neck on
my chest with that it looks full all as
though in terms of the finish it doesn't
look matte because a lot of people have
said it's quite mark which I was worried
about cuz my skin isn't the best with
like super matte foundations but it
looks quite glowy I don't know if it's
my moisturizer the primer and what it is
but it looks
flawless and then she's not got
concealer or bronzer or anything like
that I'm pretty sure the last products
that we've got to try out are the
highlight kit and the lip products I
think that's it yeah so I'm gonna go
ahead and do concealer powder bronzer
stuff like that off camera I'm just
gonna finish the eyes off as well and
just use like the darker shades on the
lower lash line and things just like tie
all together and then we're gonna finish
off with the highlights out and the lip
stuff so I'll see you in a sec okay so
eyes and Brenda and concealer and stuff
I don't know the next product we're
gonna use is the hooded beauty 3d
highlighting palette this is in the
shade pink Suns and it kind of has like
a guide on how to use them so I feel
like we may as well follow them and see
what the outcome is it says apply Capri
as a base to smooth skin and boost light
reflecting pigments and then it says dab
Santorini from cheek to temple two sets
and bring out the pop so I'm gonna be
like about here
so basically says to use this one first
which is Capri which looks a bit dark
for my skin but we'll try it anyway and
then it says to use Santorini to kind of
like bring bring the umph
if you not mean so the first I'm going
to use is a sigma tapered highlighter
which is an f-35 so I'm just gonna check
into the Capri shade at first so well
that's pretty blue okay that's nice it's
a way cuz this C can consist e the way
consistency the Capri one cuz it's
almost like a cream or like mine feels
like a crazy many way I don't know about
anyone elses maybe my brush really wet
though like is it a cream like I'm
really Buffalo K and then it says to set
it with Santorini so I'm gonna go in
with that which is definitely more of a
powder and that has a lot of qualify off
to air so we're just gonna go in with a
light hand for this one and then it says
apply azureus under the cheekbones to
add dimension on shape really that under
the cheekbones
seriously one of its going to do the Ark
definitely says that under cheekbones to
add dimension and shape
oh no I'm bit scared to do there
that's John buckle so then it says sweep
I be that on the apples of your cheeks
for a healthy glow which is the more
kind of blushy color
so what brush have we got for this
cheeky monkey
oh yeah that's cute I like that okay I
really like that one and I'm not sure
about the Capri one I'm like I'm really
buffle by that like is it cream it's
like it's like a cream I don't know as a
whole though I do with it like here I'm
not sure about the Azura's step and the
Capri step I do like this but I'm kind
of like confused if it's a cream or
powder because it kind of feels like
both in a really weird way but the
Santorini and the Abita look really
lovely and that definitely did provide a
good base I'm just not sure what Azura's
was supposed to do although I feel like
that would be a nice highlight on the
actual cheekbones anyway so and then I
thought we would use one of these cute
little sets for the lips so this is the
bombshell set I believe so it comes with
a lip contour a liquid matte and a lip
Stroeve so I'm gonna go in with a line
of tests of course I believe yeah so
this is the bombshell set and then the
lip strobe is in the shade don't alone
ritzy so I'm gonna use the lip liner
first then I'm gonna fill in with the
liquid matte of course and then go over
the top with a lip stro which they look
really interesting it's a lot lighter
than the lip like liner and the lipstick
so we'll see how it goes they applied
really nice I'm not sure if this is the
right lip for this look I feel like this
is quite Brown and everything else is
kind of like quite rosy pink and with
the liner in particular I really like I
applied it's so smooth so I'm really
impressed with that and that was really
smooth as well they're quite thin like
quite a thin consistency what they
definitely gave like quite an opaque
coverage so I'm gonna use the lip strobe
it now hmm I like that a lot
I was worried looking at it cuz it's
like super pale and super goal but they
kind of just give like a hue like just
like a little bit of an overcoat so the
actual color like you can still see the
color of the bombshell underneath but
yeah I really like that lip
all in all really impressed I feel like
my favorite thing so far as the
foundation obviously I've not worn it
like for long since I applied it before
but when reached it on me as well it did
last a really long time throughout the
night and stop and it feels really
comfortable on the skin it's super
lightweight it's not sunk in like any
fine lines whatsoever
like it looks flawless so the foundation
is definitely like an a-plus for me like
an a-star a plus and the highlight kit I
do really like some of the shades I'm
not like super short about what the
overall look of it looks really lovely
I'm really blind in eyeshadows we're
really easy to work with really easy to
blend and stuff like this I look didn't
take me long at all whereas some
palettes I kind of have to work with
blending a little bit more and I feel
like the color isn't quite familiar so
I'm probably gonna pick up the bronze
one because I love the fact that it's
like travel-size and mini I feel like
that's really cool and the quality is
definitely that lip I absolutely love as
I've just said and then in terms of the
lashes I like them but they're not gonna
become like a go to lash me I feel like
they look a little bit plasticky yeah I
don't like the way plastic heat sounds
like really bad they look nice like I
don't I don't not like them if that
makes sense but they're just not
something I would reach for and I
prepare my lashes to be a little bit
fluttery and these this in style in
particular is quite separated as you can
see which isn't something that I would
tend to wear but I feel like they
complement the look quite well and stuff
and they compliment eyes quite well
because they're not too heavy and they
were really easy to apply really easy so
if you're looking for kind of like
cruelty-free faux mink lashes that are
really easy supply and they feel really
comfortable on definitely recommend
these for that all you know I'm really
happy with this look so let me know what
you think in the comments down below
thinking so much for watching as always
I'll probably speak to you tomorrow
because hopefully I will have filmed and
uploaded the hall and but yeah I hope
you all have a lovely evening I love you
to the moon and back and I'll see you in
the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
