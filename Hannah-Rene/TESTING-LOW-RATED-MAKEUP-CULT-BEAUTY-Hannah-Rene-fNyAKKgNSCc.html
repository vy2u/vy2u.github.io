really sorry there's not been a lot of
content on my channel recently I've just
been working away and prepping it for
new videos I've got a lot of stuff
coming up that I'm really excited to
film I'm really excited for you to see
and this is one of them I've been kind
of thinking about doing this video for a
while because I've seen a lot of people
do it on YouTube and it looks like a
really interesting video today we're
basically gonna be testing our low rated
makeup so I've picked cult Beauty today
because I love cookies either one of my
favourite places it's a sharp hope you
see is basically just an online retailer
that stocks a bunch of different Browns
so it's very similar to Sephora and Ulta
and places like that except they are
online only they don't have any stores
so I picked up a bunch of stuff I only
bought stuff that was either one star or
two stars because I feel like 3 out of 5
that's like above half so it's not
really a low rating product so because I
only picked up stuff that was either one
star two star there are a couple of like
products that missing so I've not got a
brow product which is why I've already
done my brows off-camera
it didn't have a low-rated Foundation so
we'll just use them and after that and
they didn't have any eyelashes but yeah
I'm just gonna get straight into it
so I'm gonna use a concealer to prep my
lids because that's what I do every
single time I do my makeup this is the
NYX sculpt and highlight face duo
product so this is basically like a
concealer that's double ended so you got
a concealer shade and a cream bronzer or
like contour shade so this only had one
star which is a little bit so it's a
lady who reviewed their space that he
said I can't remember which one I have
but it's not very nice in my experience
it's hard to blend it doesn't sit right
it's hard to apply shades are weird and
never do anything for me I used it twice
and both times I've had to take it off
and redo all of my makeup because it was
that bad Wow when she says I can't
remember which one I have but it's not
very nice I don't know if she means it
might not even be this concealer and it
might be a different next concealer or
she doesn't know what shade is what she
left the review on this so you know I
bought it we're gonna try it oh I got
the shade what shade is this I got the
shade 0-2 almond light is very M thin
that's what I've noticed straight away
it's a very like thin consistency I'm
not even read what it claims to do so it
says use our salt in highlight phase
zero for an effortless transformation
our liquid formula has buildable
coverage and will blend seamlessly for a
flawless contour okay I mean I'm hoping
with this video even though these are
although rate I'm hoping that I'm gonna
find some stuff that I actually really
like and so far I actually quite like
that I mean it's weird because it feels
really thin but it's actually given
quite a lot of coverage I know that
could be a good one okay so if I eyes
we've got the Too Faced chocolate bonbon
palette which I did actually already
have so I didn't have to buy this on the
website is rated two stars so not as bad
as the concealer so the review says that
the brown beige and natural matte
clothes are really nice in the palette
smells really good but when it comes to
the more colorful shades I don't feel
like that as pigmented and blendable the
palette overall isn't the same level as
the other chocolate chocolate palette
but that review wasn't too bad it kind
of had like positives and negatives I
think she was just basically saying that
it wasn't as good as the other chocolate
bar palette she has I've only used this
about one spine it was a really long
time ago so I can't actually remember
what my thoughts were on there it's just
not one that I reach for a lot because
the shades are a lot cooler than the
other palettes so I'm gonna start with
the shade maca which is this color here
it's just so cool like it's just not not
a palette that I would reach for a lot
at all I don't really want to use like
the the brighter colors I know in the
review that she mentioned that the issue
with the palette was the brighter colors
but I've got like a dark red lip so it
just would look a hot mess I'm gonna use
a little bit of Bordeaux ooh pigmented I
personally have always liked to face eye
shadows I don't know about anyone else
but I always feel like they perform
pretty well they blend pretty well
pretty pigmented pretty pretty this
pretty pretty that I'm just gonna really
puck this color on get a bit of drama
llama on the outer corner not like
worrying about being too neat with it
because we're gonna do a wing so I will
clean all of this up with a makeup light
I mean so far it's fine in pretty well
I'm not like loving it cuz I just don't
look the colours but the actual quality
of the eyeshadow is fine like that easy
to build as well you can build them on
top of each other and they don't go like
patchy or weird or
like that I think I'm gonna leave the
outside corner that I just don't know
what to do on the lid no maybe I'll use
this shade which I'm not even gonna try
and pronounce that oh that's pretty
oh my god that's dry as well that's like
really nice wow this is just a mock two
for two it's just like a flat pack a
brush pack a brush flat shader brush
there we go oh my gosh that's like a
really nice color I'm happy with that
okay so just clean that up with a white
unto liner this is probably the worst
reviewed product out of everything we
have so this had two or three one-star
reviews which is not good at all so this
is the ferry drops cap liner so I'm
guessing it's just a pen liner the first
review the first one-star review who
says do not buy this was a waste of
money the product was dry and didn't
work I wish I never purchased it so Emma
says this is completely awful its
undoubted undoubted on that undoubted
undoubtedly undoubtably
undoubtedly don't know how to say that
way any worse eyeliner I have ever
bought purely down to the fact that
nothing that comes out of there a moment
I first opened it I have not been able
to get it to work at best I can get a
grayish watery math SATs 12-pound 50
down the drain
great look that up so I'm really excited
to try this now okay so it says smudge
resistant and waterproof specialized
fine tip allows you to create a sharp
line ultra fine glossy black pigments
for a smooth professional finish Sherri
drops new long-lasting cut liner with
ultra fine brush for precision and easy
applications trace out a delicate flick
I like that so this is let me just show
you the actual tip of the liner it's
very thin which I like um oh when I saw
it on camera I was like that's not that
bad but hmm that is not very promising
at all definitely not very black and
gosh I don't know I'm just gonna get
going and see how this goes so I'm gonna
do a wing I'm gonna attempt to do a wing
oh no oh no oh honey no this is not good
at all this might be one of the worst
line I ever use I mean it's just not
even black like it's not even black it's
weird because it dries okay so it drives
down and it's sticky like on my hand
it's sticky and then when you go to like
go over what you've already done the
brush like sticks - what's dry down to
shame because the actual applicator like
the tip is really nice basically trying
to like because this is an issue with
pen liners like there's not many that do
it's just the bad one but basically
because you're holding it upwards to do
the actual wing the products sinking
back down to the bottom of the pen like
it's not coming up to the tip so it's
like I'm having to shake it back down
and then go in like really quickly shame
because the actual applicator is really
nice like it's made it really easy to
apply it's really flexible really thin
it's just so weird that it's sticky like
you can't go back over once you've done
something because it the brush like the
tip doesn't glide because it just sticks
to like the product it's not the worst
thing in the world like at least we've
actually got product out but 100 cents
do not recommend this it's just getting
worse and worse and worse maybe that's
like the waterproof thing that it's
sticky because to be fair like it does
not smudge like it's much proof that is
the best we're gonna get out of it I
mean you can see the shape of the wing
like the wing is that but it's not black
so I don't know why it's advertised as
having like black pigment in it it's not
black all right I'm gonna go and do your
lashes off-camera like I said in the
beginning they didn't have any lashes on
it the website that were less than like
three stars or so so I'm just gonna go
pop on some Lily lashes and I'll be
right back hey lashes are on do you know
what even though that liner was a piece
of I feel like it doesn't look that
bad like lashes just cover everything if
anything ever messes up with your eyes
pot lashes running it's fine it will
cover it as I said we've got a primer
but not concealer which at first I was
like
kind of upset that I couldn't get a
foundation bow I feel like it's good to
test one or the other because when it
comes to skin like say if you use a new
primer and a new foundation and it
doesn't look right then you can't you
don't know if it's the foundation or the
primer that's the mast you know I mean
so I'm gonna use a primer that had a low
rating and then a foundation that I
absolutely love so that if the
foundation looks bad I'll know it's the
primer if you're not I mean this is the
fight Harry hyaluronic hydra primer base
primer situation thing so it's got one
star again or you basically says usually
i'm a fan of the by terry range but i'm
afraid i just did not get along with
this primer once applied it pays to set
in patches instead of creating a uniform
base i've tried different moisturizers
both before hand
excuse me i've tried different
moisturizers before hand but it didn't
seem to make a difference in addition it
didn't appear to have a hydrating effect
either let me just get my words out okay
first foaming hyaluronic acid primer
inspired by the advanced philia
technologies that offers an impeccable
colorless correction for a bad
complexion oh it's a matte finish okay
matte finish texture fills and plumps
the micro illipe and reveals a clear
smooth and luminous skin with an
invisible veil of radiance to be used
alone with foundation bubble blah blah
blah so it's meant to be like hydrating
in a book has a matte finish okay this
is gonna be interesting this is
expensive like by terry is not cheap
okay it costs a pretty penny oh it's
white it's a white cream I don't know
how much to use I'm gonna start off with
that but yeah if this is bad
I'm gonna be upset because I'm pretty
sure this cost me like 3040 pounds to be
fair though just looking at this side
definitely has made my skin a lot more
even like it's filled in my paws I can
already see it's made my pores look
filled and it's made my skin look
smoother you can my skin the whole bit
matte okay my skin looks really smooth
it's definitely evened everything out oh
it's like rubbing off oh oh my god can
you see that oh my god it's like peeling
off and I'm not even putting even on
yeah girl I'm just gonna go in because
it can't get much worse than that now
can it nope alright let's just start
with one side so I'm not wasting expert
if it's gonna look like a suck oh
my god it's literally just peel can you
see this at the bottom of my chin where
my jawline is oh what the hell is that
about
I'm sorry but what is that about I can't
even blend it like he's just peeling off
its peel it's like falling onto my tart
what the hell can it be blended like can
it be no it can't be fixed
it can't be Vic I'm not even
just gonna like I'm not gonna do that's
myself maybe I'll try maybe I could just
put it in the center I'll just put it
here where I've got the largest pause
okay we'll try like I'm trying to like
it I'm trying to get my money's worth it
because this is how I use Porefessional
by benefit so sidetrack absolutely
obsessed with the new professional that
is like the radium on because I can't
use the original one it drives my skin
up to March but the radiant one I'm
obsessed with and I just use it there
and it makes such a difference to my
makeup and then for the rest of my skin
and so I'll do professional just in like
my very central like t-zone area and
then I just go in with Smashbox primer
water because my skin is dry so it needs
like the hydration so we'll try and use
it in that way see if it works so I'm
gonna go back in this is a mafia Emperor
3:9 it's looking a bit more promising
maybe I can just get away with using it
the same way I use professional I think
it's just deceiving because I thought it
was gonna be like a hydrate in like
moisturizing primer but it's not at all
I feel like that is done the job way
better but even so like I would not
repurchase that I would just get my pole
fashioned all because it's cheaper and
it does use that same thing if not
better back onto the kind of concealer
Gio that we've got my necks so I'm just
gonna watch I do that I should do
contour this yeah I'm actually really
not light at that at all I feel like
it's blended out really nicely
the call is really nice like the actual
shade is really lovely only thing is
like it doesn't really the applicator
doesn't apply that much from like the
tube so you have to keep dipping in
which is it's not like the worst thing
it's just a little bit annoying oh wow
definitely oxidize is definitely
oxidizes quite a lot actually I didn't
realize that on the lid but it's just
jail I don't know if you can see what it
really does oxidize quite a bit so just
something to bear in mind
and try putting a little bit more on
because it feel like the coverage is in
quite what I want it to be
definitely I did a bit more coverage hmm
not too bad and then the powder that
we've got is by a brand called why is
this called 3c II okay so the packaging
is really cute it's made in Korea so
it's a Korean beauty brand this is the
blur setting loose powder okay so this
had two stars and this was reviewed by a
lady called Michelle she said it has a
terrible flash back if you ever want to
take a picture do not wear this powder
it does look lovely on the skin in
daylight but I got bright white patches
in photos so not ideal just gonna apply
a little bit into whoa okay that comes
out quick so it's just a white powder
I'm just gonna make sure my under eyes
on creasing so we found that concealer
isn't really creasing asshole and then
I'm gonna just set my under eye I guess
definitely blurred I'm gonna take a
picture with flash you see there
especially the flash bucket is not a
joke okay
I only impressed though with how smooth
it's no my under eyes look like that is
what the kind of setting powder claims
to do it claims to blur which it
definitely has dark all right so this is
the highlighter palette that we're gonna
use today I don't understand okay I
don't understand when makeup products or
skin care products any form of beauty
products at all come in plastic
cartridges like what is the point in
having a plastic one when you have a
cardboard one that can be recycled I
just think it's such a waste anyway this
is the Lime Crime highlight angels
palette this has two stars on club you
see I don't use a lot of lime crime
because I mean you know so the review
basically says it has poor pigmentation
after receiving this in my package I
quickly went about swatching it on my
hand that the pigmentation is subpar as
compared to your Anastacio Becca etc
even with a brush it's terrible I wish I
did not fall into line crimes marketing
gimmick of cute names lastly I just
never have understood the hype I mean
it's not as much of a hike now but with
like holographic highlighters duochrome
highlighters like just wacky
highlighters I don't get it
mix the pinky one I guess Oh with
glittery okay it's just like one big bit
of glitter like oh I just don't like it
I don't want it it just looks dreadful
that actually looks started so if that
on camera doesn't even look as bad as
what it does in person in person it
actually looks dreadful right the last
thing we got to do is lips I've not even
done my under I should probably quickly
do that Art's gonna use the same colors
just blend them onto the eyes last
product we've got is a lip product this
is by a brand called nude sticks which I
have tried nude six before and I really
do like them so I was surprised to see
this it's like lo ray air it has two
stars so it's not the worst the colors
are beautiful but they crumbled and they
were not long-lasting Burgundy had to be
I bought burgundy because most of the
review is about the shade burgundy had
to be reapplied often even though I
hadn't been drinking or eating or doing
anything they still get two stars for
the colors and because boho somehow has
a better formula than burgundy so pretty
much the poor review was for this shade
which is why I picked it off
so you basically got um the lip product
and then also a little sharpener which i
think is quite cute that is the color
that as you can see they've got a good
amount of pigmentation very creamy
okay so the actual shade I'm obsessed
with it's stunning it's pretty easy to
apply I mean because it's quite a large
pencil and it is so smooth it's hard to
get a really clean cut line though I
just went in with the concealer brush I
used my brows and stuff and just cleaned
up the edges because it's not like
jaggedy but it just picks up on a little
bit of the skin around you left and it
doesn't look as clean-cut as I would
like it to the biggest thing that she
mentioned that she didn't like about is
the fact that it didn't last so I'm
gonna keep this on for awhile I'm gonna
take my hair out because my head's
killing me but I will keep this makeup
on for a little bit and see how it all
last and I'll check in later on I mean
it's not actually that bad when I like
look straight on and I don't look at the
highlighter I actually do quite like
this look a lot so all in all I would
say what we used so we started off with
a concealer I do really like the
concealer I feel like it did a good job
at cream contouring it did a good job a
good job concealing it as well I do like
that the eyeshadow palette looks
stunning like the colors blended so well
I'm obsessed with that lid shade like I
really like the way that it came out
obviously it is more cool tone so it's
just something to bear in mind if you're
someone that likes a cool tone palette
she'll really like it the liner was just
not Tiger was not good okay the liner
was not okay
obviously the lashes stuff went from
club you see the brows weren't from coke
easy the primer the primer it's such a
shame because it was so expensive and I
had really high hopes for it but it's
just not the best obviously we've
managed to make it work I know my skin
in this area it does look really smooth
but I feel like it also looks smooth
because we use the blurring powder like
the loose powder which again I like and
I feel like it looks good now but if
you're gonna be taking flash photos not
the one at all and the highlighter is
just no lip product so far I love this
color
like I really want this to last I'm
rooting for this lip product okay I'm
gonna go about my day anyway so I'll
check back in a little bit
Wow you can actually quite see that a
flashback now oh okay so it's been about
four hours I finished filming up two
o'clock and it's now six this camera is
still wonky what the hell this is
interesting because obviously it's about
six o'clock now it's a little bit darker
so I'm only using it my studio light you
can really see this flashback now I have
had a full bottle of water I had for
lunch noodles vegetables and like soy
sauce which is quite not like oily but
it would take off lipstick if that makes
sense
this has held up really well I don't
know what she was speaking about okay
this lipstick has held out really well
if anything so they did like a little
bit on kind of the very inner part of
the lip which is where lipstick tends
like naturally fade throughout the day
yours so bloody comfortable I swear on
my life I've not topped this up once I'm
really impressed I really love the color
like I absolutely love the color of this
and the thing with chopping up pencils
like I would rather wear something like
this and top this up rather than a
liquid lipstick because liquid lipsticks
get so drying on the lips when you top
them off wear something like a creamy
pencil it doesn't kind of get as
uncomfortable the eyes look really good
I mean they look as good as they can be
with that lying around or let's be
honest so much glitter is just like
falling all over my face I've got
glitter on like around my mouth I don't
understand how the foundation looks
alright I'm definitely very matte in
this area but I'm also very smooth like
I cannot see my paws at all it's
probably only like maybe two or three
products I just would not recommend but
the rest I'm kind of loving so the liner
100% no the highlighter 100% and no and
the powder I'm so annoyed because like
it's such a nice powder but it does just
what is this I don't know the only thing
that's really ruin this makeup for me is
the highlighter because the powder even
though you can really see it on the
monitor
that's because there's a like that and
in person you cannot tell at all okay
I'm gonna get going I'm not gonna check
in later just because I'm gonna top up
my skin on my lip a little bit anyway
before I go out so it kind of defeats
the point in doing another check-in all
in all I think you can tell which
products I like on which products I
don't like so let me know what you think
in the comments
let me know if you've tried any of this
stuff I still feel like this cameras
wonky I hope you enjoyed this video
please give it a massive thumbs up if
you did and let me know what brand you
want me to do it next I feel like I
could do Beauty Bane axe because Beauty
I have at ratings as well yeah thank you
so much for watching I love you guys
some you know buck as always and I'll
see you in the next one back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
