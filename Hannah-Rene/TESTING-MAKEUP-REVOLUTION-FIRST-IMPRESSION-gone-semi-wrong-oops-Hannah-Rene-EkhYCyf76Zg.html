another sort of like testing and brand
makeup lock video tutorial so today we
are testing at makeup revolution because
I know a lot of people have been wanting
me to do this video I might try to make
parts and things like that so I wanted
to go to super drone grab a lot of stuff
from the content and then come home and
try it all on camera for you so pretty
much everything is a first impression
apart from the foundation because they
didn't have a foundation on concept and
also a face palette as well and but
everything else
well not everything else because there's
a couple it was one thing in particular
I really don't like what you'll see in
the video but pretty much everything
else is makeup revolution and I am
really happy with the way it came out
you'll see the salt issue that I had
with Han products in a minute like it
was but other than that I've been really
happy with how this makeups come out I
have to say I'm not used a lot of to
find them before apart from my crashing
opponents which I did really like and
yeah I basically talked through this
makeup tell you my thoughts and then at
the end I give you like my final verdict
on what I think is like worth the money
or what I would like repurchase or
recommend you are enjoying these extra
uploads on 2/3 and make sure you let me
know by giving this video a massive
thumbs up and let me know in the
comments so that I will do I will notice
two more but without further ado boys
and girls we're going to get right on
for the tutorial first impressions /
training makeup revolution so I hope you
enjoy that and how we Valentine's Day
because it's all kind of his name and
yeah I love you and I'll speak to you
soon okay so I have already started with
foundation on I know it looks quite like
dark and yellow time right now but I
promise it'll apply by the end just
because they didn't have a foundation on
the makeup revolution counter when I
went yesterday don't also do one someone
tell me I probably should have looked it
up but when I went shopping and got all
this bill guess it didn't have one on
the counter so I've just used the backer
ultimate coverage cream lololo
I did it use this primer underneath it
though which is by makeup revolution and
this is that ultra face face primer and
it just looks like so it's got like a
pink bottle and it says it's 24-hour
makeup protection
blah blah blah and it's not a lot to it
parting like the ingredients on the bar
it reminded me a lot of the maybelline
baby skin and in the
so that it kind of like went on and it
must aside my skin quite a lot and it
looks like it sort of filled my polls a
bit and sort of like minimize the
appearance of them and stuff and it felt
quite like silicone II so they only seem
to have one liquid concealer and this is
the focus and fix and it's a subset so I
got two shades because they only had the
lightest in the darkest one and I was
the one in between obviously yeah the
other concealers are like cream
computers but they had a lot of like
cream contour palettes which I've got
one of those as well and amongst it
concealers and stuff like that but I
don't like stick concealer under my eyes
so we've got the shade 0 2 affair which
looks really light and then we've also
got um 0-8 medium dark so the light
completely different colors but I'm just
going to have to mix them yeah it's
called deep focus and fix liquid
concealer doesn't really say a lot else
there's not really like a lot on any of
the publishing to be honest so because I
might wing it and hope for that and then
they didn't have any powder and any face
powder as far as I was aware I was like
not one more stop it was just like a lot
of palette so I'm just going to set it
with Laura Mercier underneath the eyes
and then I'm going to use the rest of
well I'm going to use and steam out
later on to set the rest to my skin just
because they literally didn't have a
face powder I'm going to go down some of
you if I'm dirty like that back now
they're together yeah they get how many
face parties and you have any makeup or
shoes as far as I could see so I'm going
to use a p2 blender to blend in the
concealer the one thing I do know is
when I swatch them is they're very
yellow toned like really quite yellow
tones so I don't really know like how
much you need to do this so I'm going to
do that much of the darker one and then
I'm going to go on top with the latter
one so it will start with that and we'll
see how it goes because I don't really
want to go over but we can see how it
freaks me out London leg
oh they're quite hard to learn now oh my
god they dry really quickly oh my
god this is a nightmare
the drive is so drying I have never used
a West concealer under my eyes I love
that saying something like they are
awful realize anyway it just doesn't
blend you can still see where I'm
applied it here I mean it have you to
find a company out you know it's fun oh
my god I like peeling away oh my god can
you see that I like peeling away my
foundation now that I'm trying to like
blend them in with a brush I mean the
camera's not even pick you're not half
as bad as it is you can see it they're
like The Strokes with the concealer that
is awful I like to stress I'm quite
stressed I'm not going to lie right I'm
not doing that
I'm sorry no we're not doing that so I'm
going to take that off and I'm going to
get my Maybelline fit me and I'm going
to do that and we're going to go from
there and try the other products but
those are awful I mean maybe on the skin
to like do blemishes but even so like
they just didn't blend out I'm quite
upset all right that was a fairly quick
fix a literalist remove the concealer
and then pop Maybelline it fit me on
instead and I feel a lot better I feel
revived I'm gonna if we have more issues
that though I might not be able to take
that dog everyone knows any of you have
it in like it I'm not saying that it's
what I am saying is by product I hate it
next thing I picked up will see an Pro
HD cream contour palette which just
looks like so so it should just has a
bunch of contour shades and highlight
shades and roll crease and so I'm going
to maybe give this one a go and helps I
wonder it smells terrible while we are
really going on a KO I'm going to hope
for the best
okay so we're going to give a little bit
ago just a little bit and I'm going to
use this little itty bitty brush and
little bearing mat and this is a
1 9 7 short handle I love this for cream
consoles it's like zero fiber right
already I can tell I've barely put me on
but they are very uh she like when I say
a she-bear are she this light gray it's
a lot cooler than I'm used to like
having on my cheekbones but for a
contour shade like it's alright it's
okay I'm pretty much just going back in
with my actual foundation brush because
even though it's not got any foundation
on its got like excess on from what I
first put on so it's just helping to
like blend it in a bit cuz I feel like
it's a bit too cool to my skin and like
the color foundation that I've got on it
just looks really quite ashy but it's
okay cuz we'll fix it with bronzer I'm
not I don't know it's like put a put a
smidge on my forehead but like nothing
crazy okay I don't mind that if you
actually like school contour shades the
new love this and it blended fairly well
with this Russian than my foundation
brush and they are quite thick I will
say like they're quite thick cream so
they don't like glide as well you kind
of have to eyes after oh yeah either
have to like build them up a little bit
or just do like a little bit time or
something like that because I don't feel
like you could go on with loads and like
blend it out as well and but they are
really cool that is all else a right I'm
just going to set my skin with some
Rimmel my name anyone was onwards and
upwards
fingers crossed that's room Valentine's
Day today guys because I'm filming this
the date goes up so feel free to let me
know what you're doing in the comment if
you are anything like me then you'll be
doing all but you know okay I'm
going to like finish off skin whilst
we're here so that we can just do eyes
and let's just focus on those so the
brand that I picked up is the
revolution's
runs a simple so it like slides out like
this and then it's got an ask here at
the back which this does computed me
like how would you even apply bronzer
with this friggin sponge how it mat as
well which I'll just say
it's kind of like an anything we cover
this it's kind of like and a terracotta
it got like a ready undertone in my
opinion like a bronzy ready bronzer and
it's matte which I like it open like my
bronzers to be sherry which a lot of you
will know I actually really like this
just given me my hopes again see I hope
you like that powders and stuff for fall
like I've used that powders interviews
that eyeshadows I did really enjoy those
for that concealer just rewrite it okay
I actually really like that and I also
really like the combination of that with
the cream contour because I feel like
there's balance teacher that out of it
now because obviously this is a lot
warmer than the contour shades at the
cream one so I'm feeling it now I'm back
in my happy zone okay so for highlighter
I'm actually really excited because I
have got the vivid baked highlighter
which I'm not used to for but I've heard
really good things about this and I
swatch it in the shop and it looked
really beautiful as well only thing I'm
worried about with my skin tone at the
minute is it looks like really quite
pale and but we're going to give it a go
and if we're going to buy some bitches
for this phone I'm pretty it's not a
pale like once you've got it on a few
low because like as soon as you swatch
it it does turn quite golden rather than
like it looks more white in the pan you
can see the gold reflex but it does look
a lot more like a white gold shimmer and
then it last but not least I have one of
these blush palette is this in a
particular shade blush palette blush
goddess which looks like so and so don't
know what to do because they've got like
highlight shades as well oh that one's
like we're it that one's like a more
intense version of what I just put on so
I'm going to try the blush I don't
really like I'm not blush usually but
I'm going to give it a go anyway just
like peachy one down here cuz I really
like the color of it oh I really like
that it's nice and subtle like it's not
very pigmented which I like my blushes
not to be very pigmented because it's
too easy to go in and go overboard like
really fast I really like that
I like that a lot so when I talk it up
and I just like do a little dab into all
of these different highlighters oh wow
Wow okay so so far all of the powder
products that we've used has been my
favorite so the bronzer dis blush
palette and the highlighter but I mean
if you're going to get one of the other
I'd get this because you've got more
shades and it sees you having like a
compact and I feel like these how it is
done more pigmented than this one I'm
not going to live so so far I would say
the bronzer and this and maybe the cream
contour if you want it if you want it
you know so that on two eyes skin is
basically allowed to just go eyes and
lips and I got one of these pellets this
is the ultra brow the ultimate brow
enhancing kit and I didn't ever want to
get it's it's massive and like if I was
gonna buy something I would never buy
something this big just to browse
because I just think it's so unnecessary
but and they didn't have they did have a
smaller like square sort of powder
compact eyebrows but my shade which is
like medium to dark is sold out so I'll
just have to settle and get the bigger
one instead we've got a pencil down here
and eyebrow pencil and then there's a
highlighter there which is quite pink
toned I'm not going to lie and then an
eyebrow arch enhancing cream which is I
don't get much concealer it's like a
cream concealer like correct I guess and
and then there's two waxes down here and
then the powders that are so normally
not to use like that's a lot of choice
for eyebrows I'm not gonna lie this is
what I mean like I just probably won't
use it all and so I'm probably going to
use a mix of the tint maybe like the wax
you want to give that a girl and then
also the power so I'll start with like
the wax if you want and use that for two
ends even do the powder towards like the
stop so I'm just going to like homeless
through the end and just to add like I
like having something waxy through the
end anyway if you watch my current
obsessions and favorites not like the
other day I was talking about how I like
using the benefit pencil because quite
waxy I do like having something waxy at
the end just because M itself adds a bit
of texture
it makes the powder on top last longer I
just feel like it overall gives us a
fuller brow and then I'm good
go in with the powder and we're just
going to see how it goes
mmm sort of work just along okay so I
like the product the shadow and the and
wax are really good I do really like
this product I would still get the
smaller one if I could just because I
think it's too big an unnecessary
kernels if you don't mean but it is a
good product I'm just going to go on
finish my eyebrows off camera because
I'm being very incapable I don't know
what's wrong with me but I'm going to go
fix it right they are as honestly as
good as the vinaigrette right now
because I have clearly just lost ability
to do anything today so we'll get a move
on I'm going to eyes and we're going to
do something like kind of smoky I think
because they didn't help any eyeliners
like liquid liners or gel liners which
are do a wing and so I got this instead
which is the 32 eyeshadow palette beyond
flawless just it looks like so it's got
gold packaging so I colored saturates a
lot like it does that one I'm quite
quick I'm just going to use like this
one and this one in the crease there's
like a matte Brown and a matte purple
here and and then what should I use
analogy I have to say there's not a lot
of maps in here so I'm going to use this
one in the crease which is like a matte
Brown this one in the outer corner and
mix it a little bit with the black and
then oh gosh
maybe just use like one of these sort of
shimmery ones on the lid that are like
sort of grungy I'm going to do like a
smoky sort of winged look oh I like that
that's pretty blue that's pretty
well I like that I like that a lot and
then I'm going to use both of those
underneath as well I'm going to start
building up the lower lash line I do
really like this palette I just wish it
had a couple more marks because I feel
like that's always lacking right now
because they're pretty much all finished
and I just don't really know what sooner
I'm going to try and put like a little
bit of a shimmer like in the dark purple
shade at the NPL I'm going to try like a
tiny bit and mix it with like the matte
black because I wanted to do something
like dark and grungy there's lots of
more comments are a lot so I'm like can
you try and do like something quite
dramatic with like one of these testing
videos and I was like cause I can do it
the color blowing those over the contour
lid and then also just like black cup
into the crease a little nothing like
too intense just going to pop those two
like right on the outer corner of the
lower lash line click here and like
blend them in up tight let me relieve it
that I'm not going to push it on the lid
just put the skin like so glowy if you
like it's kind of nice at the eyes on
that and so I'm just going to use
mascara and mascara we've got is the
amazing volume black mascara which just
looks like so the ones quite fat like
really quite chicken fat and I'm just
going to walk it on because I've cut as
well as fell in love colors smells a lot
like fruit actually I've never had them
scrub it smells like a sense how long
having on it strawberries strawberries
Oh interesting
okay so I'm great I'll do with that now
now that it's like all come together I
feel like a concealer we were just
going to have a disaster of a video but
it's come true we pull through so last
of all flip where's it gone
so for lips I did get something dark
because I knew I wasn't gonna be able to
do a lot on the ice because I'll have
that one palette so they've got these
and salvation' velvet lip lacquers I'm
pretty sure yeah it says go on as a
liquid and dries matte touch proof and
longer and longer
intense color so this one is in the
shade it velvet bump and it will
actually go quite well with the eyes now
because it's like a really dark purple
and that's so yeah it's just like a
really dark purple color I am going to
get a liner and I'm just going to line
up outside of my lips because of its own
attachments on its own but I I'm
incapable of doing like dark lip colors
without a liner so I'm going to get
something just to do my lips so I've got
night marks by Mac because it's like a
dark purple as well just go I'm up to a
disc real quick we're going to put this
on in the middle finger crossed all goes
too far
okay so let's do question nice and
pigmented it's a good start
feels nice and creamy
hasn't really cloned too many dry
patches as far as I can see which is a
good sign
yeah I'm ambassador that was really good
considering I chose the dark ground
because like dark liquid lipstick as you
like they're good test of like any brand
that was liquid lipsticks
there's a lot of my dark purple ones in
particular they just they go quite
catchy like just don't look right and
but that's applied really well I'm
impressed with that I like it so this is
the finished makeup locks we've got that
in the end after that malfunction at the
start
let me know what you think in the
comments down below if you want my
offered it I would say my favorite
products with the blush palette that has
the highlighted in as well I did really
like that and the bronzer but I feel
like I get along with a lot of friends
is so that wasn't like a surprise to me
the eyebrow moment was good but I would
definitely get the smaller box just
because I think it's like too bulky for
what it is the eyeshadows were far as
they do do a lot of eyeshadow palettes
in general that was pretty much like the
whole standard palette so I would
definitely recommend my going in and
have a look if you watch them in a bit
more affordable and we did learn really
nicely and I have tried another palette
by them in the past as well and I did
really like that one too the lip product
I really like and yeah it feels good I
mean I was I'm not holding on for that
long worth of little just on this but
the application of it and my favorite
impression of it I really like as well
but madly we're like trying a couple of
dollars if you go if you want to promote
more news I can no this isn't a very
wearable color all in all I am very
impressed continue it's such an
affordable brand and they do it in super
jock it's not in suits as far as I know
but yeah let me know if you try to need
the products from them yourself and what
you saw because I would love to know let
me know what you think of the look do
you like it would you are it tell me in
the comments that you thought watching
everything go swim in a bar and I will
see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
