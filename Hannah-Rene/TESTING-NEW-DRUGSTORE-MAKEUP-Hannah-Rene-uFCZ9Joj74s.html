you having a nice weekend wherever you
are so today we've basically got a bunch
of jokes from make up to try out this
isn't stuff that's necessarily new it's
just stuff that I've not tried before
and it's kind of just then sat in my
drawers waiting for me to try it out I
always love finding a good bargain
boys and girls so fingers crossed
there's some really fab products in here
and I haven't prepped my skin I just
went ahead and use the L'Oreal my seller
bi-phase water which it's basically a
micellar water that has oil at the top I
don't know if you can see but it's just
really good for removing waterproof
makeup and cleansing and stuff like that
because I put fake tan at my face I
always like to go in even though I
cleanse my skin of course I always like
to go in and just use my seller water or
make it white wasn't then just before I
go in with like products and makeup and
things like that and then in terms of
moisturizer and eye cream I just used
some of my rodeo products which are here
so I just used the dragon's blood i
jealous and the sculpting cream so I'm
gonna continue trying these out and let
you know if they're any good because
I've heard really good things about them
but they are pretty expensive so we'll
see how it goes you know oh I'm gonna
start off with brows cuz I want to do
brows and then eyes and then skin I want
it to be kind of dramatic and glum
because I'm going out tonight so the
first product I'm gonna go in with is by
next this is the tame and frame tinted
brow pomade so this is in the shade
brunette I have actually tried this
before but it's been a while since I
used it so I just wanted to use it again
see if I still love it so the first time
I did really enjoy it's basically just a
pomade up that looks like so and worried
mine is gonna be a bit drags it's been
open a while I have actually recently
had my eyebrows re micro bladed so they
kind of are pretty full by themselves
now be like this isn't dark enough for
my hair but we'll just go with it anyway
it's fine you guys know I really like my
Anastacio Beverly Hills pomade like the
one that they do and this one's super
similar considering it's so much cheaper
so if you do want to try the Anastasi
one or use one a brow pomade but you you
don't have spent tons of money this is
like a good jus and then I'm gonna go in
with a soap &amp;amp; Glory product this is the
archery volume boost brow fiber gel it's
just like a tiny tiny little ditty
container that's good as well because
that's actually a lot darker than the
pomade so hopefully that's gonna match
my hair a bit better this bro is like so
killing it today I'll just poke myself
in the eye concealer that I'm gonna be
using today is the Rimmel lasting finish
25 hour Wow
breathable lightweight medium coverage
concealer it just looks like this and
then we are gonna be using in the
matching foundation as well but I'm just
going to use this at first to prime the
eyes so this is the shade 100 fair that
doesn't look very fair to me in the tube
though that's like darker done the tan
that I've got on my face okay so refer
it's pretty light that's quite light
actually take that back always go over
with a sponge especially on the eyes
because my eyes crease so bad
so for shadow I'm gonna use the NYX
ultimate multi finish shadow palette
which is kind of a similar setup to the
ultimate basics palettes that they do
which I do really like I don't know if
you can tell the way I see it is like
each column is kind of like a similar
set of colors but in a different finish
so you've got all you Matt's at the top
and then maybe like shimmers and foils
or something gonna start with mix in
kind of this shade on this shade here
just as like a transition it's just
gonna go in the crease okay we're gonna
take a smaller brush I think I don't
really know what I'm doing to be honest
story of my life but I'm gonna take this
kind of purple shade on a Sigma small
tapered blending which is an e 45 I was
just using them up to two four before
I'm gonna just like deepen the crease a
bit I think I don't know
just like here'sh all that cool is
really nice
there's something about purples and
orange like reds and orange purple and
orange I just think they complement each
other so well I'm gonna take the darker
one on an angled brush as well it's
fudgy it's like juicy and fudgy
I'm excited to try these spoiled ones
like this super reflect Oh should we
swatch one oh that's pretty just build
it a little bit more with the pair books
I do like the brown but cuz it's like I
don't know there's something about it
that I don't feel is going as well with
the orange as the purple was so I'm just
kind of building on top of it with the
purple shading stage that's how we're
looking so far I'm gonna be brave today
I'm going to be brave and I'm gonna do a
bit of a cut lit so I'm just gonna take
some of that concealer and I'm gonna use
a Mac two to a and I'm just gonna you
kind of want to naturally follow you
crease but a bit higher because you want
to be able to see the shadow when your
eyes are still open if you're not I mean
and if you only follow you crease and
don't go a bit higher you won't be able
to see it as much okay so I just went
ahead and did both eyes so as you can
see I just spoke tit out a little bit
above my natural crease so what
qualities like all of them are so pretty
I wish you guys could tell me now cuz I
kind of Tony and I'll start off with the
bronze one like the paler one and then
maybe use that as like a transition into
this section of the eye so I'm just
gonna use it dry on my finger at this
and see how it goes I'm gonna use a
brush but yeah I'm gonna use fix+ to
help it out a little bit
oh that's nice these are tiny bit of the
purpley one just to kind of mush these
two together here which this one's way
more pigmented for some reason which is
annoying but it looks really nice not
gonna lie when we first started this eye
look I wasn't really sure where we were
going but now I know I know that okay
I'm gonna go ahead and do it lashes off
camera because I don't have any new
drugstore lushes to use so I'm just
gonna use the makeup by Samuel by Lily
lash right lashes are on for the first
time in my whole life I feel like I need
to tell you this cuz it's like an
achievement I've managed to stick these
lashes on without any black liner so I'm
not about any black shadow on the line
my eyes or anything I've just stuck them
on just on my natural lashes and which I
wanted to do just because I feel like
there's so much sparkle on my lid from
this foiled pigment in the palette I
just didn't want to cover anything up
you know I want it to have a full moment
so these lashes from Lily lashes as well
the makeup by Samuel ones are like
bundlers so they're not as thick as the
ones that like from the normal
collection so they are easier to stick
on without anything covering them up if
that makes sense I've not got a new
drugstore primer so I'm just gonna go in
with my Smashbox photo finish primer
water because you can't get this at
boots and stuff anyway I know it's
technically not like cheap Chuckster but
it's technically still drugstore I guess
I don't know if so I just love as well
because it's like it's just such a lazy
product you just spray on and it's done
and I am lazy okay
less steps as possible please okay for
foundation I'm gonna go in with the
Rimmel London at lasting finish 25 hour
breathable medium coverage foundation
not tried this before but I have heard
really good things and I do usually like
Rimmel foundation so I'm excited to give
it a go at the show so I've got a 203
true beige and then a 400 natural beige
so I don't know we're gonna see I feel
like natural beige it's gonna be too
dark so I might have to mix a bit of
this in what brush to use oh I need
to like dump in my Beauty Blender be
right back
so I'm gonna try it natural beige first
is it called yeah so this is 400 natural
beige I like the applicator like the
applicator is a little squiggly doe foot
situation it's really interesting okay
that is definitely too hot because put
this around the face like we'll put that
there and then I'll go in with the
lighter wine and pop that like here oh
my god that's probably actually just the
right color by itself but you know oh
wow we've done it now I'm gonna try and
blend it in with a sponge I kind of go
back and forth between using a Beauty
Blender for foundation I feel like with
some foundations it works really well
and then some it just doesn't on my skin
like it just with some foundations it
makes it look patchy I don't know if
anyone else gets that up I mean out
really easily as well which again I'm
all here for just hoping it lasts well
though because considering I'm going out
I just need it to look good for the rest
of the night this is quite a nice way to
naturally it's not really like so again
I'm just using the dark one at the top
if you have like two shades and you want
to mix them you can use the dark one at
the top like around the perimeter of
your skin and where you wouldn't
actually contour and that will kind of
do a natural contour job for ya know
what I'm gonna do about concealer though
now cuz this is definitely too dark for
the concealer that we have from Rimmel
they don't have another drug store can
see that I could probably mix it with
something to be fair I'll probably do
that burn it out really easily with the
bt going there like really easily
doesn't look cakey doesn't look heavy
doesn't feel heavy I'm gonna take my
shot my shop in the shade medium and I'm
just gonna apply this if this is light
enough and I'll just have to use this
for today but if we can get away with a
bit of an extra highlight I've just
drawn that on my like why am I such an
ass if we can get away with a little bit
extra highlight without it looking too
crazy and then I'll go ahead and put
some of this on as well just to see what
it blends out like and we might be able
to use a bit of the Rimmel one but cuz
it's so light it will just be like a
touch okay I'm gonna put its tiny bit of
the Rimmel one on just do like three
little dots like that then again I'm
just gonna go in with my sponge and
start blending that out just gonna see
that yeah I'm really enjoying kind of
wish I cut some of the other shades no
but I'm pretty sure I put them in like a
giveaway or in like the goodie box at
Christmas because I thought the ones
that I kept like this one would be fine
because in the tube it does look so much
darker than what it comes out on the
skin my skin looks super flawless like
I'm living so I'm just using my Too
Faced powder because I don't have a new
one to try okay to finish off the under
eyes I'm what you're just gonna take
some of the mattes in the same palette
so like the orange on the kind of
brownie shades and stuff I'm just gonna
blend that under the eye
then I'm just gonna finish off with
mascara so this is just the Maybelline
lash and lash sensational bought bronzer
this isn't a new product but it's one
that I do really enjoy and again it's
from at the drugstore so this is the
Maybelline master bronze color and
highlighting palette so I'm just gonna
use a mix between these two middle
shades here for bronzer this like little
palette is so cute it's got like a
really nice champagne gold highlight as
well we're not gonna use that for
highlight though I wanted to try
something new so this is the NYX bond to
glow highlighting palette and I really
love the stroke of genius palette that
they do which I'm not gonna can't open
it which again is a highlight palette so
I thought we'd try this one out and
obviously I'm like gravitating towards
the gold so that's what we're gonna use
mmm scuse my voice
oh yeah oh yeah and then pretty much all
we've got left to do is lips so I'm
gonna be using one of the Maybelline
Gigi Hadid lip liners because I have I
need to start honestly I've not tried
this yet this is the lip liner in the
shitty Gigi 12 McCall I'm gonna use this
to fill in my whole lip color and then
I'm gonna go in with a Maybelline hot
like a glass one of the vivid hot lahood
glosses in this shade 60t so that's like
so pale like that would usually suit my
skin tone I feel like but because my
foundation is a bit darker than normal I
feel like it's a bit too light or is it
I don't know I think I'm gonna heave
actually I quite like it being super
pale it's not something that I would
usually wail like being this pale but I
feel like it just gives all the
attention to the eyes and the eyes
deserve that so this is pretty much to
finish it look I feel like every single
product I used I pretty much absolutely
love stand outs for me we're definitely
the shadow palette by NYX I just think
those fold eyeshadows are stunning I
also really love the foundation
absolutely living for this foundation
hopefully it was well I'll let you know
on the screen here if it did or not the
concealer I really like
we say I only really use it by itself on
the eyes but it did blend really well
and create a really good base for the
shadows it will also cut that crease
super well brow product by NYX I've
always loved on the brows sat by super
glory I really like as well I actually
really love my brows I definitely don't
think that's who like I think I was just
I don't know being silly a lip products
I love the lip liner I kind of like at
the same time because it's so skinny it
just takes a hot set I don't know the
gloss feels super comfortable oh so it's
like super shiny as well which I'm all
here for at the bronzer palette like the
pilot by Maybelline have always loved
the highlight palette I really like it's
quite yellow and there's highlight but I
do really enjoy it all in all I'm just
pretty happy with everything so let me
know in the comments what you guys think
give this video a massive thumbs up
thumbs up thumbs up if you enjoyed it
I'm gonna go anyway because I need to
get going to Cannes we're going out for
a sister's birthday so yeah I'm really
excited thank you so much for watching I
love you guys the muna back a million
