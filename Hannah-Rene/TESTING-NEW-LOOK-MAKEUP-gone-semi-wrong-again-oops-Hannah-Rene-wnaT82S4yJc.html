another tension Tuesday video because
it's obviously a Tuesday well so today
we are testing a new look I literally
was jump on it before and I didn't
realize when you look at all that people
now it's like a massive door and they've
actually got like a really big beauty
department section and so I went over
and has a nosey and they have solely
photos they pretty much have a full face
and so I pretty much just yes grab
everything that I thought looks good and
I've sat down and tried it all today for
you I have to say I really do not like
this look at all but that is not because
of the product is because of me because
I chose the dark eyes of a legion
doesn't match my outfit to pinky and but
the only has three shades in the
foundation which in obvious is going to
be like a little bit difficult to match
and then I chose walnut with bronzer and
I feel like it just looks too well and
the lip is a villainous eye and it's all
but nice but it's okay because I usually
aren't a match a lot of the folks
really love though and I'm really
impressed like this is the first brand
that I've done where I've never tried
any of the products before I'm really
impressed with like pretty much all of
them so I'm really excited to it share
my thoughts of them I hope you all
enjoyed this video anyway even though it
does a lot a bit wrong I feel like you
all just know me by now like you know
not to expect them in the back so this
is a perfect example of how we want to
get animated and massive thumbs up if
you do and if you want to see how I
achieve this situation on the face and
wiping Camilla products better to keep
watching okay so we're going to start
with eyes because I got like a couple of
antigen eyes and also an eye line and I
really want to try out and I want to do
something quite dramatic and or at least
try and use something erotic so don't
mind my arrow face we're going to cover
that up and it's going to like put some
moisturizer on first because I'm
actually approve right now I'm so dry
all over the next joke crystal first
video filmed and running flat kind of
like don't be nervous
it's where like being in here and it's
weird like you're not having my family
here with me I'm just using it number
seven daily moisture and beautiful skin
of a little blood and I always
you walk into this all because like I
said I'm a prune right now this is
really weird like being here because I
don't I've only just started organizing
stuff and don't know half my thing that
I'm going to help me but no one can help
you with me so this is what what is this
this is a color and pillow LOL this is a
color and perfect concealer brush so we
needed to apply concealer on the lid and
the base and we can feel that i got this
is the only little one they had a lot of
creams and then it's stick and the a
thing out there well this is the cover
and perfect liquid concealer i very
initiate porcelain i got everything in
the lightest shade today because i am
fair and I've become embrace the furnace
so like a brush applicator just like
come to knit up oh it's coming okay I
like to have a really full coverage baby
sighs you know because I have quite a
beanie Island feel like I've mentioned
this a couple of times but I like it to
be pretty full which is why I don't
usually use a concealer to that and
because I usually use soft ochre by Mac
which is like time line which is like
really going which is like pretty full
coverage okay okay now it's like it's
not super full coverage book pro
concealer don't start covers my eyelid
quite well I don't want this rush so
what actually got I got two of the small
pellets and quads and we have one big
one but I wasn't really feeling the
colors in the big one so this one is in
the shade dark news and it looks like so
basically got I'm pretty sure it's like
three months and like a bit of shimmer
although none of them look like
completely mark
oh no yeah kind of like really matte
finishing up here this one's like a warm
ground watching bunnies in the crease
mix with this one and then it's got to
sort of more cooler darker Browns that I
also got the natural news which looks
like so I just looked at the look of
this gold sheet here one thing I also
did get the eyes and this is one of the
island pencils and it's in the shade or
shades it within at the shade intense
teal and it's like a car key and I saw
this and I was just like I need to
include that so I'm probably going to do
this on the way I got one article
because this was the only one that looks
remotely like I would enjoy using it so
this is the shadow contour and crease
brush that reflects like so and they're
all material fiber ones which I kind of
wish they were because I don't know I
just want I mean it feels quite stiff as
well so I'm going to start with the dark
needs one and I'm going to use like this
shape here
and mix it a little bit with the warm
one up here this reminds me of texture
by Mac as well which is I want my
favorite marker shadows well they're
pretty pigmented right already this
brush is just like I'm just like water I
mean it's not the worst brush in the
world but I just don't see how I just
see like you would have to spend so much
time using a brush light nation select
crease : and underneath the two t4 by
Mac instead and I know some people are
going to like I'm already using that
term Black Canary feels or it is it
mostly know like you know like that it
is so much better
oh my goodness the other ones - Stefan -
Janet the Crips feel like the crease I
think yeah that one's pretty
I'm going for like a rounded I today I
think which I'm not doing in a while but
all the reason I am is because the only
false lashes they have that I like look
of around it in fact I might even real
doozies but more about tweezers no cut
not much edges and I've got I've got
scissors which I'm just building up
those crease color oh you know I wash my
brushes I wash all of my brushes just
before marriage so they'd be like really
clean for when I got here and it just
feels like a dream like honest with ya
I'm concentrating it like equally on
both sides because we're doing something
more rounded hello for sure I'm gonna
like start limited free liner this could
be the best decision ever or the worst
decision ever but we're going to try
anyway I'm gonna start closing it
against the left side and then I'm going
to bring it up a tiny bit and then I'm
actually going to use the eye shadow
brush from they love because it's quite
dense so it's going to be good at
blending out cream and I'm gonna use
that to smoke it into the brown
transition color
going to see how father want to take it
all some things like that I'm just gonna
start with a little bit now I know those
who I Parnell don't worry won't by the
end and it's mostly than I expected it
to be like now that it's up sit on my
eyes like it looks more green when you
swatch it on your skin but it definitely
like blood Downton s'more with a true
teal and inclination wise really good
really creamy blended it quite well just
using like the same new lip brush that
we use this fall we're going to go in
with this same transition color I kind
of wish there was a dark on in the
palette now that wasn't that but I'm
just going to mix in a little bit of it
anyway and put it in the crease to like
blend that together okay
so far so good and I kind of wish I
hadn't added like too much of the cool
brown now that was what I was worried
about something like it's like looking a
little bit cool in the crease which I
wanted it to be warmer but you can still
kind of see like there like orangey
shades so we're going to go there I'm
just going to do the same on the other
eye and I'll be back for you in a minute
okay so I've done the same on the other
eye
it definitely looks way more blue than I
wanted it to so it was going to look
like more green you can't tell on camera
like tons and I wish the crease was a
little bit warmer but that's obviously
like my fault like the products
themselves I really got like so far in
William Pratt I have another eye liner
which is in the shade black plum and
which yeah it looks like the sort of
almost black couple really cool ashy
Brown and I'm just going to use it to
like really how it will not tight lines
which is sort of like um define the
walls light a little bit more not like
the left leg oh my god to find a less
light a little bit more so that when we
go in with lashes that the lashes look
blended with our natural ones it'll make
sense okay so these lashes are double
tirana false eyelashes I don't know from
the nails cut long because he'll is
really struggle putting lashes on
without tweezers I'm supposed to sure
I've don't have any tweezers but this is
what they look like
hmm so as you can see like round they're
like fall all the way around sorry and
they've got quite a thick lash band
which scare me
I feel homeless walk through the makeup
brushes because I'd wash them and let
them dry like I said and oh my god
saying goodbye to control over
and it was the hottest thing I don't
even answer by Excel crowd she just
looked to me like where are you going
and I was like I wish you could bring
des oh my god no I'm actually getting up
Sarah
okay this is quite Gary I'm like
the left okay kind of our audio are hats
off to your looks because if I can put
lashes on without freezes that means
that bloody easy to apply do not really
because I really struggle okay so for
skin they have two primers we had a
luminous one and a mattifying one so
obviously I got the luminous once again
so this is called the illuminating
makeup primer that comes in a white box
like so all the happy ones like really
lovely and so sleek and minimal and then
the actual product just looks like this
and it's watching in the shop ranking
because I didn't knew straight away and
I want to lean this one over the mattify
in line yeah so it's like a white sort
of you can feel like the luminosity NL
looks like stroke rain girl so it feels
nice because it feels sick but I love a
thick primer
I love of primers it's basically a semi
driver it definitely glowy but it's not
to Chloe if you know I mean it's not
like crazy and then it's a foundation
they had a bunch of different
foundations we had like loads of options
and a lot of them were like mattifying
runs though so the one that I went with
was the flawless liquid foundation in
the shade porcelain I got the paler
shade so I'm hoping it's going to match
because I am snow-white and hopefully
turn on I got a couple of brushes so
which brush shall we try this is like a
duo fiber like a it looks like to talk
Mac ones that everyone looks like the
foundation stippling brush like so it's
called the flawless finish different
brush oh okay does not do a bit too pale
because I have like left over tunnel and
out yeah it is a bit too light for me
which is a first I have to say it's got
a nice glow to air and it's covering
fairly well I mean it's hard to tell
right now and what it is covering pretty
well brush is nice but to be honest like
stipple brush is in general I just
should always be car
they leave brushstrokes on your skin and
it's half like lemon in and but for an
actual stippling brush this is really
nice under Switek so it's not my
favorite thing to apply foundation where
I got this one as well which is the
flawless finish duo blending brush and
this looks like more of a solo and Buki
like packing on brush I'm going to give
this one a go instead
oh yeah that is so so it's so maleeni I
know I have a whole foundation of much
it it has a too dark or too light I
can't have a myself anymore so far so
good
and this time there's just a little bit
so struggling to blend it's almost like
the brush is moving there but not like
the skin it's not like sticking to the
skin it kind of just million product
around and I'm not keeping it where I
want it to be that's my only issue so
far but it's nothing crazy like the
coverage is pretty good it's pretty full
coverage I'm not gonna lie it reminds me
a little bit of M Studio sculpt by
marketing I've ever tried bath as areas
like one knows for example with Sigma
knows that it's kind of moving product
around and not like actually at Harry's
my skin what does not Alan cross like
I'm really impressed with the coverage
does it feel heavy on the skin like it
doesn't really feel like I've got
anything on and I'm just going to warm
up my face because it's really building
me that I just look like a ghost so one
product that I did get and I think a
powder bronzer because the powder
bronzes were really shimmery and I just
I couldn't do it so that I can't do this
to myself especially at a time it is a
little crazy and if I did can't be a
cream contour kit so this is in shade
although I think it's like a know one
shade fits all and it just looks like so
so there's like a highlight shake here
and then to crease that they do look
pretty warm for like I'm not gonna live
I'm just gonna try this one can we use
the same foundation brush a minute
because if you're like with creams like
it's always nice to use the foundation
brush that you use because it's got
excess product on so I blend it in a
little bit better blending really well
really well
they're very lightly
they just blend out like really easily
my skin looks crazy nouns and if you
like that too long for the foundation
the issue is the foundations are pink on
the tone and my neck because it's got a
bit of a time it's got all of them to
tone so they just look right and I don't
know what to do what this I thought okay
I'm going to fix it later
I'm not going to look at anymore and
personally you can same concealer under
the eyes so this is the cover and
perfect just like the twist you won I'm
just going to watch some of this under
this is not going to help the situation
this is also like a bit more pink toned
but what can we do is going to use the
other side of that and so it and we need
the other side of the brush just book it
running out well but it is creasing
quite a lot I'm not gonna lie what I
mean up could also be because I'm using
this and not Beauty Blender but the
brush is women out which is settling
into like so many fine lines I'm like
wow great and that is powder
I got you high definition a finishing
powder which is basically just a clear
powder
now let's slap the rest of the skin with
that as well and if you have a part of
right so that just looks like so and a
real life fix is massive I just love
little really big part of us so I hope
everything's just just over the skin
feels really nice and really lightweight
and it's not too much define either like
it's not it's like fat but it's not like
it still looks fairly luminous as you
can see like it's not really taken away
like the luminosity of the foundation
which I really like that can feel like
how could they know like I said I don't
like it under the eyes but that could
also be the way I blend it out of the
brush it just looks like a little bit
cakey it's really kind of settle into my
fine lines and it's not a full cover
effect it's not got as much coverage as
I want it to and but it's not the worst
thing in the world
the only thing so far that's like
bugging me so for brows I bought the a
drug hit in shape and define and no joke
I just opened it it comes with tweezers
oh my god so this is what it looks like
it's got a gel at the end and then it's
got to shape here and I'm going to start
with gel and then I'm going to sit up
this bill last going to concentrate this
like here that gel really doesn't have a
lot color payoff at all and like slicing
it and it's got I can use V on my finger
there that is not the color that's in
there okay that gets a no from me look
okay so when you are doing like a good
swatch ah what where is it it's not that
I'm just gonna use the carbon instead
okay that's looking a bit more promising
so I'm going to keep my brows kind of
little today like that oh my god how
pale do I look really it's going to
finish off the eyes so I'm going to put
some up whistle to meet Brown in the
waterline and then I'm going to apply
basically some of the soft brown at the
warm Brown that was put in the crease
and underneath lucky for me you start to
blend it out and that is about in it I'm
really impressed with the product exact
say I'm really impressed after seeing my
blend in here is not that great I'm not
gonna lie
so don't wanna but the actual quality of
the products I'm really impressed
so I don't know this well they didn't
have like a decent powder bronzer and so
I'm just going to use it me and dark I'm
Matt and warm up the skin up a little
bit because my foundation is still this
looks way off and it's bugging me even
next what I'm really excited about this
is that strobe highlight palette and it
looks so so pretty and so this is what
it looks like inside is three different
shades just like the sort of neutral
shade and more pinky one and then some
in a little bit
and so I'm going to use the palest line
obviously and then I pick your best robe
fun brush as well it just looks like so
I just love it with fun Russian
highlight all that's really pretty
that's really pretty yeah I do really
like that paint some pretty a nice
little glow and then slips I picked up a
couple of different lip liners and I
also got one of the must lip creams and
then I got you cloth as well this one is
in the shade dusty pink so just go over
it all of the pink vibe today probably
not much favorite lip liner LOV use like
it's not it's not very opaque and you
know the pigmentation is like not the
best but it's doing the job your liquid
lipstick is in the shade new pink oh I
got it so pain I might even like new
that's how you're literally doing really
pigmented buildups like 1/5 I love the
other here it's just like a big fat dosa
really smooth on the application really
impressed about that's probably my
favorite product so far that was really
good for liquid that's it always does
not hide it on like properly art well
that's one go and it's done I don't like
the color with the eyes I know it looks
bad and when I turn it down a bit now
this glass so this is in at the shade
new it's one of that lip glazes it's
called a high shine liquid it just looks
like so it looks a lot more like sutural
so hopefully I'll turn down the lip a
little bit you guys made it a bit more
coral so it's not like question with the
eyes so this is the finished look and I
know the colors like the whole situation
is just wrong and I know it's like I
know in general like the product
I'm really really unimpressed with the
only thing that I didn't like is the
concealer the lip line is kind of
wishy-washy like it's not bad but it's
not good and the brow product like I'm
not much in front of either what alone
that I really enjoyed everything as you
lose
the liquid lipstick I'm really impressed
like I'm probably going to go back and
get some of the shades those a lot of
the world chocolate cheese glass got a
pink one and now I kind of see why the
boss I really like and the highlighter
it's nice and specifically works a
little bit well toned down and I would
definitely recommend it yeah I'm sorry
it kind of just looks a hot mask but
some so long just a hot mess and I'm not
even ashamed of it I hope you all
enjoyed this video anyway give it a
massive thumbs up if you did and let me
know what groans you want me to try out
neck and and yeah I hope you enjoyed it
anyway I hope you got something out of
it maybe like discovered some products
that you want to try yourself
thank you so much for watching and I'll
be I swing them back and I will see you
in hopefully busier but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
