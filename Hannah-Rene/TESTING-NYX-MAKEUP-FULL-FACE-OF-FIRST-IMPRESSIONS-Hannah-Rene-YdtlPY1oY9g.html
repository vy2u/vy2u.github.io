uploaded on a Tuesday which is very
different for me because I usually
upload on Thursdays and Sundays as a lot
of you will know I was asking on Twitter
what videos ever wanted see and a lot of
people mention like testing videos where
you sort of like test new Browns and a
lot of people started recommending like
a ton of brands that I don't usually use
on my channel and it got to a point
where I thought it would be beneficial
or it could be beneficial if I was to
just do a whole nother video on a
different day of the week and basically
just use it and sort of test new makeup
and new Browns that I don't usually use
in other tutorials Oh today we are doing
it NYX because that was the most voted
for and when I suggested like four of
them but let me know if you enjoyed this
and you like the concepts of it and I
will do more and also let me know what
brands you would want me to film I have
got a very sort of long list so I'll
sort of like put it on the screen here
and so you know sort of like ones I'm
thinking about I really hope you like
the fact that I'm introducing a new
video to the week I'm going to try this
for like four weeks maybe and see how it
goes and then we evaluate that but if
you do enjoy this and you want me to
carry on doing these on a Tuesday make
sure you let me know by giving this
video and message thumbs up and
obviously NYX is a brand that I have
known for a while like I love it next
one of us especially our iPhones and
then lip products so today I pretty much
tried out a whole range of products that
I've just never useful because I want it
to be like a full face of certain
fashions every week so I thought of chat
through all of these videos are going to
be taught through I chat through the
products as I'm using them and I'll give
you like my final verdict on stuff
towards the end so this is the look that
I did it's probably watching a nude lip
and then an ombre liner because NYX
offer like a really cool range of like
bright products and things like that and
then just simple cool so I really hope
you enjoy it I think this is everything
everything but I wanted to save this
intro I'm going to go anyway this is
Metro is on fire
I've still that I've been in my cold so
don't mind the fact that I'm just like
floating around in like a massive jumper
and just looking like it's early
adversity how I achieve this makeup and
what I thought the products then it just
keep watching okay so I just got
moisturizer on and I'm going to start
with skin so we're going to be premises
and I'm sorry if I sound like a man
who's so got a really bad
we're going to push Mary so I'm going to
use the mixer face primer spray a little
LOLOL the primer spray sorry this is
what it looks like I've never used like
a spray as a primer before I usually use
the cream so I thought I would give this
a go and see what it's like so I'm
guessing it's quite self-explanatory
really just going to spray Dante I don't
like how much is enough I don't know I
just don't know if I like see how primer
sprays can work as well as cream female
on foundation I got the NYX studio what
is this called junior photogenic and
foundation which looks like so in the
packaging is just like a little square
teeth - they've got the shade of 103
natural and I do have a little bit of
fake tan on my hands and arms as you can
like see here it tends to wear off with
a lot quicker on my neck and my face I
don't have anyone else has that problem
but I wanted to get something that much
to my arm signal and not on show right
now so if it's a little bit too dark
then I'll just run it down my neck and
but I'm pretty sure yeah it says it's a
high definition foundation right
diffusing ingredients with skin
imperfections and create the appearance
of smooth flawless skin creates a soft
focus effect to minimize the appearance
of fine lines and make sure complexion
and natural radiant finish all right
we'll give the go sounds good a good gap
brush I didn't get many brushes because
they didn't have a lot in stock and but
this is it's not actually labeled but
it's just like a big foundation brush I
think it's the Foundation's
it looks like it also I picked up new
foundations I never know like what the
right way to blend them is because like
a lot of my foundations I like to pop
like push them in but then some like
really need sort of like swiping fair or
might do like half my face with this
brush and then half the face palmarès
in the brush that I would normally use
it's quite liquidy like it feels quite
thin um I don't know I expected it to
feel thicker but it's not like a bad
thing I feel like I prefer this brush
but that's probably just because I'm
used to this brush like it's like my
courses so be like is definitely
oxidizing
it looks radiant like it doesn't look
too drain or anything like that which is
always something actually happened with
on my skin but it's just like you're not
covered some bits as well as I wanted it
to like it's kind of design move product
around but not like it doesn't come easy
looking very opaque if you don't mean
like in terms of the pigmentation of it
it just sort of like cool those areas
that are easy to cover but then areas
where I've got this a little bit of
redness it's still poking through organ
feel like I have it this one right here
which is called gotcha Covered cue I
like it it's a waterproof full coverage
juhi finish or they were concealer okay
so I got it in the shade light which is
that one up from lightest shade and then
I also got a loose powder because if you
like it's really hard to find a good
drugstore loose powder so this is being
mixed HD studio photogenic finishing
powder and I'm pretty sure I've tried
this before and I did like it
so we're going to like give this the
gross like set concealer and also to set
foundation though this is an own line
brush just oh this does have a name only
actually it's an O 3 and then it is
until 9 it's like a mini duo fiber and
it's got like um and angle to it so I
thought it looks quite cute for
concealer I just - did you do so do I go
to do oh it feels like really thick ok
it's like quite thick so it's not
liquidy at all feel like this is
definitely a beauty under job oh right
I'm gonna go get my Beauty Blender cause
I'm not feeling the brush at it again
nothing like a Beauty Blender for
under-eye concealer so where the
concealers like a really quite luminous
I don't particularly like my under eyes
very luminous so I'm going to like say
it with powder that part is so Mastiffs
is you can see a difference here and
here Wow Mars don't think I have any
loose charges that make your skin what
Department that we can do is crease like
really badly I have to say like usually
underneath my eyes I have one fine line
which
watch every can see the creases in two
but this is Kristen - like five fine
lines of you like it will be a good
concealer for like blemishes but I'm not
convinced about that salt and dried I
feel like it's a bit too heavy to me
anyway because like I don't know
obviously I have dry skin when you use a
light just as the powder across the rest
of the skin but I don't really want to
like and I want a muffin I must go too
much because my skin just doesn't look
right map but when people ask for all my
tutorials and just like up to feel so
wrong Livi brows waxed and this is the
payment frame brow pomade it just comes
in a little pot like so and it's
waterproof what else does it say yeah
pretty much is on this waterproof this
is in the shade Xpress oh yeah that
should be fine so I'm just going to use
the same brush I always use my Mac 266
because they didn't have any like slim
angled liner brush is in stock I can
already tell and we're gonna lose just
so and I can already tell that I like
this like it's nice and smooth it's
God's got a lot of pigmentation to it
it's blending like really well through
my brow hairs and put them on areas
where I don't have as many brow hairs
like it doesn't look out of place I like
that I like that a lot if you like it if
you like with some ponies like for
example - Agia one you can't really like
it's hard to achieve a natural look with
it because it's quite a thick formula
whereas this isn't a thick so it doesn't
look as like heavy on your brows and
look as intense then I'll leave browser
but I'm really impressed with that I
like it so one thing that I have well
and listening is this side because it's
like a mini dinky palette this is one of
the beauty school dropout 101 and this
is in the shade nude and then when you
open it up it's just got like a really
nice mix of sort of warm shades and so
we're going to get this a bit all kind
of wish they have a slightly paler matte
and in the palette but we're just going
to work with it so I'm going to use this
one cents in the crease I'm not going to
do anything too heavy on the eyes
because I've got a bright liner because
I wanted to try on the delivered liners
and so I'm probably just going to use
like this one in the
crease a little bit and then probably
throw in like the seagulls and stuff on
the lid and that's pretty much it
because I want to I want the main focus
to be on the lineup and then I do get a
brush to this this is the sixteen and
it's like a it's sort of like a dance
it's quite stiff but just like a
blending brush looks like so I do really
love next eyeshadows like I've tried
them before and they do blend like
really well they're so good for the
money
and Nick's like eye shadows and then lip
products like my favorite things that
they do fingers never fail you when it
comes to eye shadow I promise you you
really don't
yeah just like a nice sort of orangey
warm brown tint and but I'm just going
to leave either the shadows because I
already know that I love Nick Martinez
now I understand recommend them and I
picked up one of these this is one of
the vivid brights
in the shade fire I think wildfire it's
like a bright red as you can see I have
red in the color liner yeah I mean a
general designer a couple of times
but I usually just use a liquid lipstick
that's like feel it or maybe I should do
like a black and then do this on the
inner portion yeah let's do that between
a big fat black liner as well this is
the matte liquid liner in the shade
while this is black which is just like a
black lip liner so I'm going to create
the wing with the black and and then
I'll drag it back I'm not entirely sure
how far along I'm going to drive it back
we'll just see how it goes
and as you like the inner portion with
the like sort of pink you ready one Oh
yellow for you pretty good
I like the pinky one I wish it with a
bit more red and what the color payoff
of it is fast and it glided like a dream
so emerging on the eye of camera alright
so I finish off the eyes and I just put
some eyeshadow underneath just so that
we cannot do mascara straightaway so
this mascara is the skinny mascara and
it just looks like that you can see the
Wanda bit guy just looks spinny
Henson in a good get a set of lashes but
the more I look at them the more I just
know I'm not going to like them and
these are the wiki lashes in example two
level looks like so WL o nine and they
just look quite plasticky but to be
honest like when I was shopping on the
next and they didn't have any lashes
that I like to look up and that's like
that's not me thing about lashes or
whatever but they just all looked quite
um yeah plaster hue I don't know
obviously they're only about five pounds
or so on today but I feel like red Carey
there's a like a surprised if not
cheaper like four pounds and then
usually less a lot riskier they just
sort of look like plastic oh yeah it's
like really skinny it's like tiny I
picked this up as well because it look
like it would be good for lower lashes
because it's like so dinky yeah it's
really cute and tiny how long I do quite
like it I was worried that it would just
be like not so good because the one so
small well M it does a really good job
of like to nan Batian our eyes are drawn
I do quite like them and I do really
like the colored liner like the vivid
one it the matte one I'm not a massive
fan of um for in general like the
overall look a bit I really like it they
were quite easy to like blend as well
this is an eyeshadow like the liners
like the ombre you don't see on it okay
so I'm just going to finish off the skin
and then all we will have less to do is
the lip so I picked up the mix highlight
and contour pro palette which looks like
so I feel
quite a popular thing to mix because
obviously it's kind of like the
drugstore vision at the anistar z1 but
you got like extra you get two more
inserts as well okay so this is what it
looks like in side and all the shadings
are on the back as well which is really
handy because you can't actually buy
individual and the bees like pop them
out and reinsert them so I'm going to
start off with this shade down here I
think this is in the shade tan and we're
going to give it a go it's got like a
highlight shade in it as well as like a
shimmer you know like it's all just
looking a bit chalky no now I feel like
this feel like my skin in general is
just looking like quite chalky and dull
mmm like I don't know if it's the powder
the foundation so it just doesn't look
right
oh no someone call me I feel like it's
looking a bit muddy is it as me is it
however but it no I don't know a fall
highlighter I've got these stroke of
genius palette which I do actually have
like or do you have this about a use
this and I do really rate I think it's
lovely and somewhere you'd mostly just
sort of paler one down here and then
also mix in a tiny little bit of this
one as well just use it like on the tops
of the cheekbones etc but true so so
segmented and glowy I do really like
that palette I think it's really good
for the money
so for lip pencil I have one of the
retractable lip liners in the shade
Vanilla Sky just looks like this it's
like a really nice nude so we're going
to give this one a girl I really love
the color of that it's just like such a
nice of neutral with like a slightly bit
of pink in it like nude and I've also
got one of the lingerie and liquid
lipsticks because I said oh she tried it
so far like I love the liquid like the
soft matte lip creams and stuff that
nixed us and but I've never actually
tried one of the lingerie ones which I
feel like I think more popular I don't
know they have like more news so this is
in the shade lace detail and I kind of
got it hoping that it will match the
liner so we'll give it a go and see how
it goes
to application like it's quite large I
could go for but it's like to use I
really like that as well like that only
needed one application I didn't like
read it the brush or anything like that
it was lips and just like what's not
gross but now I mean I didn't like read
it and reapply yeah it literally just
needed like one swatch and the
pigmentation was so good if quite sick
and we do see like it reminds me of the
soft matte lip creams and feel it she
just applied was John like that's just
one swatch of it I've never done it or
anything like that and yeah I really
like that so this is the finished look
ignore my hairline like I know the
bronze up here looks a bit crazy and
also like my roots are going through so
it looks actually I think vinyl binax I
still love NYX the most for their lip
books from that eye products because I
feel like they just nail those and
especially for the price point like
they're so good and my favorite part of
this would definitely be the lip I just
love the color there I love the feel of
it I love the fact that it only needed
like one swatch the lingerie liquid
lipstick and I love the lip liner as
well I didn't realize the liners and the
black ball is a tiny little bit
difficult to work with at some points
because I felt like it Drive mark like
really quickly and but the vivid ones
are like I love them I think if you're
someone who likes bright makeup that's
something that I do in the life but next
if you like for an affordable light
drugstore brand they offer like so much
in terms of artistry and lip color and
so the vivid line is I do really like
those I'm not a massive fan of the skin
I'm not going to lie and but I don't
think it looks bad and so when it comes
to skin like a lot of people including
myself like I feel like you just have
set products that you know work so well
for your skin that when you sort of
train new skin products out you always
compare them to those because obviously
skin something that's a little bit more
difficult to get right and it like
there's a lot I should a lot of lip
products on the market if you like that
are sort of good and do the job and I
feel like it's just like it's more
difficult to sort of find skin products
and like foundations and creams and
roses and stuff that you like just as
not so if I was to say if I was to
recommend anything from this tutorial I
would definitely
the lip product the bedliners if you
like bright liners and bright makeup and
the pomade is really good and religious
work with and the struggles like palette
those would be like my top things but
yeah I really hope you guys enjoyed this
