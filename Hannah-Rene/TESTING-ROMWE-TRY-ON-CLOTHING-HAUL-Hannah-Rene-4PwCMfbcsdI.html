something like hey guys it's time and I
don't know why I feel like one video I
just sucked on it just like dinkum up my
mom so here we are I hope you all doing
well and having a good week so today's
video is going to be a little bit
different it's basically gonna be like a
clothing haul and a testing video and
watch so please don't mind my how like I
actually just look like a girl up in my
head but it's fun so I mentioned this
video a couple of weeks ago on Twitter I
have no idea what's taking me so long to
do I'm really sorry but not so long ago
I was on YouTube and I was looking
through like my recommendations and
stuff like that and I came across
Patricia brights channel which I have no
idea why I did not find us sooner
because she has incredible content and
she's like a super fat channel so she
basically has this series where she
spends a bunch of money on a clothing
brand that's usually like an online
brand and things like that and then when
the stuff comes she gives like a full
review of it
and a lot of the brands are kind of like
unusual brands I would say as well like
the sort of friends that you'll see
plastered all over the Facebook and
Instagram and stuff like that so today's
video is inspired by Patricia's kind of
like series that she does some gonna
leave her Channel and her videos down
below so the brand that I picked out for
today's video is romwe I think it's
pronounced I'm not entirely sure what
correct me if I'm wrong but it's spelt r
o M w e just trying to actually like log
in to my account so I can get like the
full all the details of everything I
ordered but it just is not working and I
don't know why so I'm probably gonna
have to I will link everything down
below that I mentioned in this video of
course and I'm probably gonna have to
pull out prices and stuff down that as
well so pretty sure like 99% sure that
this brand is based in America but they
kind of like source a lot of this stuff
from China from what I understand again
correct me if I'm wrong and in terms of
shipping and stuff absolutely fine like
there was no British of those no import
tax and shipping was fairly inexpensive
from what I remember like the whole like
cost of everything was just like super
inexpensive which is obviously great so
I'm just gonna get straight into it boys
and girls
I'm I tried to get mixed I told myself
that I would get 10 items and I when
he's got a mix of like t-shirts baths
louses like skirts
don't shoot so the first it's hot which
is actually the first thing that I put
in my basket I thought it was so cute
and it's so funny because like when I
place this order it was like summer it
must have been like end of August staff
like September and now it's just like
get into Christmas and it's just not
really a Christmas type or hey oh okay
so it's kind of just like a patterned
v-neck like vest situation it's got kind
of like a peplum bottom which I really
like it's such a different material so
the rest is tapas a lot sooner if the
whole vibe is quite like boho like chic
just like really nice to power with a
pair of jeans and a belt and like some
sandals and stuff like that which like I
said it's winter now not very
appropriate so the first thing that
worried me about this when it turned up
is the fact that is why and obviously
with the material and stuff and with it
being like patterned I swear I just hear
noise it was not just me I was worried
it was gonna be see-through because
white tops and like materials like this
just do not go well with nips but let's
be honest it's not exactly the sort of
top that you could wear a bra with
either so I was like please think as far
as please at work so far I'm pretty sure
because I film the try and clip without
a bra obviously I'm pretty sure it
wasn't see-through so I was super
impressed with that but the actual shape
of it turned out to be quite strange
because I'm just check actually when I
look at it now yeah so okay right so
this side you're not really gonna be
able to see on camera like when I show
it but you'll see in the trial clip it's
like this strip of material is longer
than the other side because I had this
massive like apron section on like my
boob area when I was trying it on that I
didn't have on the other side like it
faded really nicely on the left side of
my body but then on the right side like
it was just really gay pee and like I
just couldn't have worn out if you're
not I mean because it was just like too
exposed and I was just don't feel like
safe in it so that's the only thing it's
kind of like inconsistent in terms of
like the actual feta in it but the
material feels really nice yeah I do
actually like the top itself I just
don't know if I'll be able to wear it
with like in terms of the fit in there
okay and then the next t-shirt I tried
on all the tops first so this is just a
plain white crop top but you guys know I
love a good crop top I was a little wear
and then with like skinny jeans and like
mom jeans and stuff like that well like
I said it's just why I'm it's just got
this really pretty like Rose embroidered
on to the left through the area so it
also has these really interesting like
cut out sections on the neckline which I
thought looked really cute on the
website but when I shine it on like you
just I kind of wish the
I kind of wish it was just a normal
neckline if that makes sense because it
just looked a bit odd to me phallic none
of this job has been ironed like I've
let you two tried it straight out the
package in so bad that I mind
um but either way I kind of just wish
that this was just like normal because
it's just a bit pointless in my opinion
like it doesn't really add anything to
the top it just makes it feel a bit
strange if you're not I mean actual
quality though it really thick like I
was impressed because like it's super
thick feels really comfy it's super soft
and I wore it with like a strapless new
bra and you could see the bra through or
anything like that like it just felt
really nice on and really comfy and I
got all of this in a small by the way
I'm pretty sure okay and then the next
thing as I said I want to get like
different styles of t-shirts and stuff
to kind of like test the brand out as a
whole so this is like a cropped kind of
 situation which when I got out and
punching I already knew that it is just
like not something that I would wear for
the actual quality again really nice
it's a little bit see-through but you
can get away with like a nude bra
underneath I kind of think it's like
meant to be kind of a little bit shared
and stuff it's kind of like that kind of
vibe and it has got rolled sleeves it's
basically just got this kind of
checkered square situation like going on
all over and the collar as well again
it's not mean is not been iron so I
can't really comment like be too
critical of it and but it felt really
big like it felt too chunky for the top
if you know it means it's quite a small
like pinky's heart and the colleges felt
really like clunky on me that's not the
right word but you know I mean it's very
like large if you know I mean like the
whole thing is just like oversized like
it's got like almost like back wings but
not bat wings
I tried styling it a little bit as
you'll see in the trying clip like I
tried it with the color as normal and I
didn't do the color up because it was
too big for my neck like it just would
look silly like it it wasn't fitted to
my neck if you not I mean I'm I tried it
with the color just like normal and I
tried it folding it they call it down
and I also try to turn it in different
places
definitely feel like it looks better
with the buttons done and then it's high
as the bottom just because again like I
said it's quite oversized and it just
really like loose and strop on the
bottom yeah it's not really my thing
like I probably will not wear this and
like give it to a charity shop or
something like that but I just wanted to
get it
see the quality and the fit and things
like that if you're the sort person you
would wear this style of like crop
shirts and stuff then you'll probably
really like this oh my gosh and then
this right okay this has to be like my
favorite thing out of everything I
bought and it's like the tiniest dinky
thing ever so this is just a strappy
vest which for some reason again even
though it's like getting into like
awesome winter I've been wearing strappy
desktops so much recently I have no idea
why because they're just like not
practical so this is just a white one
and again it's got this kind of like
rose pattern like embroidered on it one
thing that I did notice on this site is
that they kind of seems to repeat like a
lot of stuff like just some different
pieces if that makes sense so I saw
these roses a lot so I'm not mad at them
I think they're quite cute and stuff as
long as you obviously don't go overboard
with them and I love the fact that
they're just in fact ya can actually
have some nails again with the Roses on
yoke's nice and thick again really ugly
material like the ones that I have my
other strappy best shops are from like
Bashkir which i know is quite affordable
again but um like Urban Outfitters find
a shop called brandy melville and stuff
which is like kind of still inexpensive
I guess but either way it feels like the
same quality as all the rest of them and
then on to a jumper because I want to
make sure I got jumper to compensate for
all the non winter stuff that I picked
up it's basically just a grey like a
plain great jumper it's kind of like a
normal length like it's not cropped or
anything like that but I do like the
fact that with the bottom it kind of
splits either side if you can kind of
see your actual material is so soft like
it's kind of interesting because it's
like not like super super soft but it's
still like nice and comfy like it's not
one of those jumpers that you'll put on
and instantly just feel itchy only thing
again like the net is just so big like I
didn't know what to do with it because
it's kind of like a muddy cold it's her
on that kind of and and I wish it was
like more fitted tee mat so that it just
dinner
kind of makes you Naturals look really
big but you kind of roll it down again
I'm not I don't really love it being
rolled down so I don't know how I'm
gonna wear it yet but the actual jumper
itself is really nice on to the last
piece of like
situation and I bought basically I'm not
gonna lie like when I was shopping on
the site I really struggled like there
just was not a lot of stuff asshole that
I was like super obsessed with I really
like this like you'll see on like in the
tri own clip it looks really nice the
actual like material it feels like a
swimsuit if you know like a swimsuit
it's quite like silky and stuff it kind
of feels like that and it's quite thin I
will say um I had no issues with like
the vajayjay area like it was nice and
long okay it was nice obviously it's
very exposed it's not gonna be for
everyone and I feel like to pair with
some wide leg trousers or like skirt or
some jeans or something like that for a
night out and you do have to be careful
in it because I've been over to like I
pick something off the book I don't know
what I was like I bent over when I was
writing this and there was just like
boobs everywhere so it's something to
power mind okay so on to like other
stroke other than like tops this is the
skirt that I picked up so it's just like
a plain black skirt reminded me a lot of
one that you saw by misguided which is
why I was super drawn to it because I
really loved the style of it it kind of
just has its like a faux suede and then
it has lace up on either side oh I'm so
sad about this because like I said I
really love the style a bit but it is
massive I'm pretty sure they would like
an extra small I'm not sure if they had
like an extra extra small but for
reference like I'm an 8 to 10 I would
say in like skirts and jeans and stuff
and this is small and it was weighty but
yeah it's a shame because it's super
thick like really thick and really
quality I just don't know how the sizing
when it's just about wrong okay and the
only dress that I liked on the website
was at this one my hair because again it
reminded me of a dress that I purchased
my mascara which I wear all the time
like I wore it on and Charlie's
eighteenth party like it's just such a
nice like girly kind of dressy but still
comfy dress so this is this hot pot is
basically and just like white with like
ruffles and it has quite a high neck
which goes up a buck by the way with
little buttons and it just goes down
it's like a really flowy white dress
Joba laid as well if just in case you
want to know so it's actually got like
kind of like an on display it which I
don't think is detachable I think it's
like sewing into the dress which is
obviously really good I think it's just
like a bit clunky like
reminds me of like the Grouch if you
know I mean you know when she's all
right like did she want her white dress
I'm sure she goes I like the girl out of
the ring like it reminds me of it that
and I don't really want to go if that
kind of look if you I mean I don't know
what it is like
it's a weird because I love my misguided
one but it feels a lot more like dainty
when it's on if you know I mean whereas
this just feels like my grandma's just
me as you know I don't really know
although my grandmother would dress me a
lot better than this I might don't call
her my grandma a coalmine not actually
what she says she'll flip I'll link the
one down below from misguided as well if
you interested it's kind of like
littering the same style but it's got
light little polka dots and stroke on it
okay and then I really wanted to pick up
some punts because as I said I wanted to
get like a good range of everything so
these um I've actually seen this style
of punts like everywhere at the minute I
don't know you started it but I feel
like so many brands are doing it and so
they basically like cigarette you can
either get them in like cigarette or
like wide leg trousers and then they
have it this waistband which is kind of
a like ruffled and I don't know I don't
really know what to call it but it looks
really nice on because I actually have
other pants with this style that I love
when I was looking at the size guide for
this I kind of knew who already that I
was just gonna have an issue with like
wearing these because none of the sizes
much me so I got these in a small and I
struggled to get them over my hips and
my bum a little bit and then after I did
as soon as they kind of got to like just
below my belly button they got really
tight on the crotch I do really love the
style of them they're a bit then this is
probably the only thing that feels a
little bit cheap I'm just like yeah a
bit like not the best quality and then
the last thing I'm actually kind of
wearing basically I put it on over this
top because it was the last thing that I
tried on and I've literally just started
filming the video and it was a jumpsuit
and I do have a clip so I'll move over
and I'll insert here so that you can see
me actually try it on it's a black
jersey jumpsuit and I'm so like I'm
still on the hunt for like a good like
body corn Jersey jumpsuit that can wear
like in the day with trainers and things
like that I was hoping it was gonna be
this one but oh my god it's the worst
fitting I've ever known so it comes with
adjustable straps which is super handy
because I have to say like the actual
straps and
the material that Kobayashi babies was
just like really not that I like like I
had to make them so short so that they
would actually like cover and then it
goes down and there's literally just
like no fitting around the stomach or
like the crotch like it's so buggy which
you'll see it in the clip as well and
then again for the trousers and stuff
like just slow buggy guy is like I don't
know what is going on yeah thumbs down
the worst thing in the whole it's not
even gonna go to Acharya shock I'm not
gonna burden anyone with his chums here
I'm just gonna put it in like a clothing
recycle bin um but it's alright because
that's the only bus this is pretty much
the only piece that was actual just like
 everything else is like like either
really nice I like semi okay if you're
not I mean so to be honest I'm pretty
happy because I didn't have massive
expectations yeah let me know if you
have it shopped at romwe slash runway I
don't know how to say it yourselves let
me know if there's any other brands that
you want to do for these types of videos
and if you want me to do some more and
stuff like that because I would love to
know and like I said but make sure you
go and check out Patricia's channel and
her videos because they are so some of
them are really putting it like she's
such a funny girl yeah I think that's
pretty much it I think you so much for
watching I love you guys some you know
back million times over and I will see
you in Sunday feel but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
