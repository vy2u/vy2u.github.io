another testing Tuesday which I am so
excited about you guys know I love
filming these I have been a die-in to a
film with these pallets for so long
honestly I feel like the most
disciplined person when it comes to
makeup because I'm really good at not
touching stuff when it arrives and like
waiting to film with it like legit I've
still got my Jacqueline Hale palette and
I'm still not to watch it like it's
still waiting for you so I'm not even
touch there but today's brand is gonna
be well it's not really a brand but it's
more so a collaboration and it's soft as
nails in collaboration with makeup
revolution which I was so excited when I
saw the announcement for it because it
just sounded incredible so together
they've brought out a palette like an
eyeshadow palette which this is the
packaging for how cute it's just like
all rose gold and like copper and things
like that and then they've also brought
out a highlight palette as well I
absolutely love so I think she's one of
all of those people ever so I was so
excited like I said when I heard this
coverage was come in and I've seen
amazing things about it so far so I'm
really excited to have a girl with the
products so I've just had a quick look
online to check prices and stuff like
that obviously makeup revolution is a
super affordable brand I actually did a
whole entire separate testing video on
the light entire brand itself with like
foundations and stuff like that I think
I use foundation did I use foundation
I've honestly developed because it was
like that many months and months and
months ago but I'll leave it on the
screen here so that you can go and have
a nosey if you want to this is what it
looks like in size got pretty much
everything in here I'm not gonna like
this retails for ten pounds which as
long as it's like good and it performs
well is incredible for the price
considering how many eyeshadows you get
and how big the palette is comes with a
massive of mirror as well which we all
know is super handy when you travel it
and things like that
the pollak does also come with an insert
which basically has like all the names
on I don't know if you can see and I
personally wouldn't keep this just
because it's the sort of thing that I
probably lose and like forget to put pop
back inside the palette and so I'll
probably take a picture of it later just
select key because I do think it's
really cool that she got to name all the
shadows so yeah we're gonna do eyes
first I'm gonna start run now because I
realized I've been speaking for ages and
ages but I've got all my base and
everything on that is not a shadow and
highlight that like I don't know what
kind of look I want to do a couple of
people mentioned using the purple so
maybe I should try giving that a go
which is like this
yeah it's like a really nice kind of
shimmery purple okay so I'm gonna go in
with this shade here which is called cup
of tea love that name I'm just using a
Mac two to four I'm just picking up like
a fat amount on the brush the color
payoff is really good by the looks net
I'm just gonna start popping that in oh
hello there oh my god do you see that
that's like paper up straight away I've
not even dipped back in and that's like
covered my entire crease obviously
because I've got my face on first as
well my face on this like my base makeup
I'm hoping that they're not gonna have
any fallout or anything like that I mean
I won't be like that mad if they do
because like a lot of eyeshadows do have
fallout um but hopefully it's easy to
clean up cuz I don't really sat the
middle of my face I don't know if that's
just me but being someone who has dry
skin like I don't tend to sat here where
I should I would like fall okay maybe
I'll do like a reddish crease put purple
on the lid does that compromise because
I really want to use the rights look
okay so I'm gonna dip into this one here
like this red shade I'm just gonna take
it on a sigma e25 so I'm gonna start
playing here and then I'm just doing
where I do with all my kind of like
winged looks and I'm just like building
a wing with the shadow I forgot to say
what shade that is that's the shade
pumpkin suitable for the month okay so
but tiny bit fallout where's my powder
brush this Reds needing a tiny bit more
building up than that first color dead
but it's definitely not bad thing if
anything it's kind of nicer that it
applies softer considering like what I'm
using it for cuz I'd rather like build
that up then and going to intense if you
know I mean the actual color though is
done it and like I love that it's
vibrant and like actually a brighten not
coming off pinky because some Reds
Impala is I don't know if it's just me
but they come off like pink on my skin
it's I'm just dipping in for the third
time just to like really build that
right up nice and by tranqs I'm gonna
put other colors on top of it but I just
want to make sure that it still comes
if you not I mean comes through okay and
then so deep in the up a little bit I'm
just gonna do the exact same steps with
this slightly darker like more burgundy
color down here and this is called
danger you always use as well just so
you know when I'm creating the actual
like wing I always use like the very tip
of the brush so you literally want to
like as if it was like a liner brush
just stump and like swipe it to like
give the wink effect so I've got a
little bit more fallout here what I'm
like beginning to realize with them is I
mean it's kind of obvious but if you
like really tough off the excess and you
won't get any fallout but then you don't
get as much color payoff because
obviously you've tapped a lot of it off
so if you're gonna do eyes first then
you can kind of be super heavy and stuff
and you'll get a really good color
payoff but if you are like me and you've
got your base products on you probably
want to be a little bit more light
handed make sure you're really tapping
off the excess product and then you'll
just have to spend a little bit more
time like building it up if that makes
sense okay so these are looking really
pretty so pretty can you hit anyone
elses caps nor was that like be
literally just mine okay what I'm gonna
do is I'm going to take a little bit of
loose powder I'm just kind of like set
that there what we're doing the rest of
them we're gonna go in with a tiniest
bit of this color here which is cold
this is the shade rosewood I believe and
it's kind of got is quite a cool toned
shadow but it's kind of got quite like a
purplish base to it so because I'm gonna
do purple on the lid I'm hoping that
this will kind of tie in and make it all
like a little bit more cohesive and
stuff yeah it does anyone elses like
Pat's know because crunchy smells so bad
frisbee doesn't like our other car but
crunchy is the worst for snoring and
Taffy's really bad for it as well like
Cain's dog she honestly I've never heard
someone
something snore so loud in my life is
crazy like it genuinely wakes me up in
the night like Hello toffee but I won't
iisten to us and honestly I want to be
the sort of person one day who has like
just a house full of animals like I just
want animals everywhere but cane also
wants some gloves are on the same thing
it's like I just love them they really
are just like your best friends I think
more so than humans understand more so
in humans okay so this one's not a point
as well if I'm gonna be hundreds and
honest it's nothing crazy but it's just
a plane like a bit patchy I don't know
if it's because I've got like too much
product on the brush I'm gonna try a
different brush quickly I only want a
tiny bit anyway because we use in purple
on the lid so I don't want to lose like
the Reds and stuff what's everyone's
favourite like Pat like if you could
have anything as a pet what would you
have when I was doing that I always
wanted horses and I used to horse ride a
little bit before I actually had like a
panic attack in one of my lessons like
honestly the reason I stopped going like
having riding lessons and stuff it's
because I legit how to panic attack him
like the last lesson I went to and then
I just couldn't go back it was so weird
but we're but it was just like really
like not expected if you know I mean I
really like wish I hadn't stopped going
but yeah I always wish that I had horses
I might still have them one day if I
ever got like get back into it okay that
looks a lot better now as well I'm
really happy with that so I'm gonna
leave that as it is and just do the
other side I feel like it's such a good
form of fitness as well like I was
always so much like fitter because it's
actually really like it takes work it's
a ride a horse which everyone I feel
like so many people like oh my god you
just sit on it like the horse was all
the way up but he's not sure who you are
like I legit stopped going in because I
had a panic attack get more lesson which
I don't really have panic attacks often
I really don't I got this car actually
Joe has to be like really specific
situations um when I like have
full-blown panic attacks cuz like I said
I really don't have them often luckily
like I feel so lucky this usually in
situations where like I like I just feel
really out of control and really like
I'm comfortable in the situation I'm
like I just don't feel like I have like
no control to change it if you know I
mean yeah I used to go to ride its
bottom which is in Swint and if anyone
knows if you're looking for somewhere to
have like riding lessons I'd honestly
really recommend the place I if there
was nothing wrong with the place like it
was just me okay guys I'm gonna leave it
that I do really like how it's looking
and purple took a little bit of time
blending and I'm still not like a
hundred unhappy with the side well it's
nothing like crazy it's nothing where I
like don't like the way it looks if you
don't I mean it's just a bit it's just
me being like super picky anyway I'm
gonna go in with some Naz radiant creamy
I'm just to cut the crease because I
want to use the purple on the lid but I
want it to have like a clean space just
so that we can see the true like color
payoff of it I'm just gonna wipe this
away now cuz I'm not doing any more on
the outer corners so yeah I'm just gonna
use this to cut the crease in the brush
that I'm using is a two to eight by Mac
and I'm just gonna go in with a two for
two bye MA really really love that color
okay and that was a bit full owl and you
just want to go back in with the outer
corner brush just soften the two
together okay so these are the eyes so
far actually really impressed with all
the shadows I've used both like the maps
aren't there sort of like shimmer
metallic formulas as well I think
they've applied really nicely and
they've all mesh together really well
before I do lashes off-camera I just
want to test out the black in the
palette I love the fact that it's got a
matte black kind of map why I think
that's really really important in
palettes are just a little bit one
pilots a box it's just super handy so
I'm just taking that on a sigma flat
definer and a fifteen and I'm just gonna
kind of like press this and oh yeah
that's pigmented always do this whenever
I'm doing lashes just because it helps
to match my natural lashes and my false
ones together then I'm just going to use
the Lily lashes in this style dallara
just because I will east of the J and I
really
love the way they look so gonna pop
these on off-camera and I'll be right
back okay so lashes are on start off on
the lower lash line I'm gonna use this
kind of pinky color here just because I
haven't tried this one Yap so this is
the color peaches I'm just gonna run
that along the lower lash line and then
I'm gonna go back in with the red
Colette here and just build on top of
that completely up to you heart how far
down you take this and how dramatic you
make it you want it to be like super
glam like how I'm going for the
nighttime to extend this quite far down
and then it last but not least I'm just
gonna apply it a tiny little bit more of
that powerful shade and just mix it with
the Burgundy
just to give us a little bit more
definition I'm just popping a brown
waterline in the brown waterline I'm
just popping a brown pencil in the
waterline this is just my makeup forever
one which I always use it's in the shade
m60 and then just to finish off some
mascara on the lower lashes
those are the eyes complete I'm gonna
highlight the inner corner with the
actual highlighting palette just to test
out onto the highlighting palette this
is 8 pounds which again is an absolute
bargain and it comes with 8 different
shades as you can probably see this is
what the actual like it looks like in
the cardboard packaging again it's got
like so little signature and it's all
kind of like rose gold and like beige
like nudie themed so this is the color
selection that we've got to play with
all of the top row is quite like Goldy
like gold and champagne colors as you
can see and then the bottom row is a
little bit more kind of like colorful
and fun so we've got kind of like deeper
shades here and they're more like kind
of coppery like coppery kinds of goals
and then here we've got two really fun
ones we've got more of like a pinky tone
and then a lilac one here this one is
like screaming my name looks stunning
so I'm gonna try this one which is oh hi
crunch we're gonna try this one and just
mix it with the slightly lighter one
there and the brush that I'm going to
use for that is a cig
tapered highlighter f-35 which is why I
always use for highlight app oh my gosh
ah cest I always do like above the brows
and stuff like that as well a little bit
on the chin Cupid's bow they are shown
in don't mind my friends in here by the
way winter patchy but oh my gosh they
are gorgeous look at that that is like
so blinding that's like dry as well I've
not even wet the brush or anything like
that I'm gonna use the lightest shade up
here as an inner corner highlight just
to see hmm
so this is pretty much the finished look
umm which it feels were saying that
because I've lit just an eyeshadow
and highlight I'd used to do a lot more
in videos like this and but honestly
all-in-all stunning like I'm obsessed
with both products soap and makeup
revolution have absolutely nailed them
and I love the way the eyes come out I
love how like warm and juicy is like
it's so awesome no I love it
and the highlighter is absolutely
beaming like all I did I won't to say as
well for those of you who maybe don't
like a super intense highlight some of
them are oh it's mine crouched mine
scratched a little bit on the lid some
of them are a little bit more um I don't
know if you can see but these two
especially aren't as like blinded so I
feel like you could really get a bunch
of different looks out of this like I
feel like it really sue a lot of
different skin tones and be suitable for
a lot of different people depending on
what kind of highlight are you like to
go for and in terms of the Palais
honestly for ten pounds like it's great
don't mind all the fingerprints on the
mirror it is insanely good for the money
like honestly compared to some of like
my higher-end shadows and it's like a
fraction of the price I just love the
fact as well you have so many options
with this like when you look at the
color selection like you could do so
many types of looks so many types ever
looks were there it's just like endless
options honestly I think she's
absolutely nailed it with like the
colors and things like that I love the
way that there's a lot of warm tones but
there is kind of like cool tones mixing
as well and I love the fact that there's
a matte black kind of matte why
I just think for travel and stuff and
like the value for money is spot-on
so huge congratulations to self and
makeup revolution on these two pallets I
just think that's done in and I'll leave
links in down below I believe that on a
site called Tom Beauty and I'm pretty
sure they're in super drug and stuff
like that I do know that they're not
limited edition they are permanent part
of the line I believe um and yeah I'm
pretty sure they are in stores and stuff
