another testing video because obviously
it's a Tuesday and I feel like too big
to just to call not testing to fit my
brother today we're actually testing it
top shot which I'm so excited about
because I don't actually have a lot of
touch-up makeup the only thing I've ever
owned is one highlighter and I didn't
use it a lot because it's too dark for
me so it's pretty much like a really
chatty test end video the whole look is
quite different from experience because
I've used like a green sort of shimmery
pigment on the lid and I'm doing like
really fluffy brows which I've been
really into recently I've also done
little fake freckles which you might not
be able to see on camera and I use one
of the freckle pencils that Topshop does
and I really enjoyed like the way it
looked
I also hasn't been so excited that I've
been wanting to share with everyone for
so long now it's been like a couple of
weeks where I've been itching to tell
you all I did actually mention under
Strom life if you were watching but I am
actually moving out I am so nervous and
excited and scared but happy all the
same family members who just feel so
excited and lucky and blessed and
grateful and really cannot wait to share
it all with you because I feel like it
is full of our homes yeah I just wanted
to make you aware because I will also
hopefully be doing some vlogs on my
second channel so I'll pop it on the
screen here and it will be like on the
side link so you can click the little I
button and they'll take you over and so
you can see me sort of moving in and
like get in like bits of furniture and
stuff and getting a little home bit and
putting everything together and stuff so
you can come along on the journey with
me I just can't have to leave like it's
happening no I mean like watch inspire
like wow and but yeah if you want to see
how I did this makeup look and my
thoughts on the top shop makeup then
just keep watching okay when the start
with skin because they didn't have an
eye primer as far as I could see it's
called the glow and time and in the
shade light year I think this is
somewhat yellow so one because as far as
I could see those two so this one and
then there was another one which
occurred from the NEMA which looks a bit
more paying the ultimate quick fix for
instant elimination and radiance which
used alone or as a primer to achieve an
all-over glow applies cheekbones brow
bones forehead and cubed so the
highlighter to create a perfect show
effect so it sounds a little bit like
stroke cream by Mark and but it does
look like it's got into it where a
stroke cream you can't get with himself
it was originally just like a white
creamy at least as you can use it as a
primer or a luminous
beef which I let the Sun us so and when
it all comes up quick it's quite grungy
as you can see I've not actually got any
fake tan on my face so this should be
interested in I'm going to apply it with
the brush that I've been using recently
for primer and moisturizer so this is a
mock 1 to 8 because they didn't help
brushes either I don't really know like
how much to use of this oh it's very
glowy like very glowy you can see like
this side compared to that side already
is so much more luminous and obviously
like the pin as well as sort of change
the color of my hair it's really jewy it
reminds me a lot of them L'Oreal Lumi
magique the primer like that except it's
like continued our first impression it's
very very luminous it will probably be a
nice product on the holidays that I like
a little bit of warmth the skin because
as it says you could just use it on like
your cheek bones and stuff to add a
little bit of a highlight because it's
quite brandy as well right so that is
what it looks like it looks okay like
the only thing that bothers me is the
tense like because it's tinted it looks
quite uneven and because it just it also
doesn't match my skin and but we're
going to go over all the foundation
anyway so it should be a problem they
only had one foundation this is the air
cushion
skin Perfector so I got to initiate fall
because they didn't have many shades I
have to say I think those are about six
or so and the base that you had on the
website there was like a little demo
where they had a team of six or seven
but they had a different model say for
each shade so I basically picked out the
one that I thought was much my fake time
and it might be a bit dark for what I've
got on but we'll just blend it down the
necklace always oh in although I
start oh yo it is oh my god it's so so
it's a bridge in fact formula to create
naturally flawless skin with a
weightless fresh feel and micronized
pigments blur away pause and
instructions the water share billable
formula adapts perfectly for all skin
tones
so yeah it's designed to be a sheer
coverage I'm just going to like share it
out as best as I can to make it like not
too dark
I'm sorry but that's shade five and even
that looks light in them
gone that shade fall
that looks nothing like that like that
looks nothing like this I thought I
liked a lot how warm my skin looks
compared to her skin someone tell me if
you think I'm being silly but I just
think like the photo just does not have
it doesn't give a true representation of
the color of this foundation so far it
looks okay but it definitely is like a
sheer coverage I feel like it'd be like
a nice everyday foundation to someone
who wanted something like really quite
minimal have other questions foundations
like one by L'Oreal which is like their
nude crocheted and I really like that
and but this I don't like as much
because I feel like the actual the
actual cushion it's quite thick not
maybe she liked the L'Oreal ones like
quite runny so I feel like it blends
nicer and I don't like cushion
foundations to have too much of like a
sit formula look how dark like is not
just terrifying
that cushion scares me and I'm right now
about this question yeah because like
when you dip in your brush in I feel
like I just it feels quite dry that's
the issue like it feels quite dry when
I'm blending it in its just bothered me
because I feel like the photo on the
website it's been edited so like really
wash out that's like the colours I feel
like it's not as saturated as when it
was taken and I just think that's like a
little bit misleading I don't hate it
but it's not my favorite that's my final
verdict I think I can see where because
they didn't sell a concealer and just
when they got Maybelline fit me and I'm
going to try and lighten the change a
little bit because as you can see like
my shoulders are a tiny bit lighter so
I'll be back in a minute maybe mom you
should going to is flat okay today I'm
sort of about the foundation like I saw
for the first time in my life I would
have had a shade that was right and I
fail but now that I'm looking at it I
just looked in the bathroom as well I
don't mind it does just look very
natural and very sheer and that's why I
would say so if you like a natural
foundation you'll probably like this and
because it helps quite a natural finish
as well as its really tongue down and
that base so yeah if you want even looks
like kind of natural stuff in every a
quite sure you'll probably really like
it but if you ask for glam and a full
coverage like me then you want so I'm
going to mix
Maybelline and not sure glow
because my mother's one is in the shade
vanilla icing and it pretty pale pretty
damn pale so I'm going to look a bit
crazy for a min but it's okay because
her neck Renee does not leave the house
looking like crews better and she always
fixes the Murphy kind of like the
combination of these concealers by the
way this is such a side note but the
nozzle and is a couple people asked me
when I did my full phase first
impressions they want my final verdict
of it was it's just like quite sick I
would say so I have to be careful like
if I use it on its own it concrete's a
bit on me and but like with the Mabley
one so maybe we want a little bit
runnier and I feel like they work really
well together leave soon the other can
see in the malfunction like revolution
video this was my god they'll have
nightmares about that let me browse
off-camera did they help browser I just
think that I feel like they had a brow
pencil but if I'm going to be honest I
didn't buy it because they have a
browser on a brow gel but I didn't buy
them now I don't know I know I probably
should've actually bought them sooner I
feel quite bad now to feel like some
people didn't you know as I didn't so
I'm just going to browse our camera I
shall be back in mid already get the lid
I got brow pencil I know actually I got
chicken me are you actually are you
actually shooting me are you kidding me
this is Jeremy I was thinking that I
don't even bother getting brow pencils
or anything wrong related and then start
here with a friggin brow pencil
basically like a little brush at one end
and then it's got the actual brow pencil
there it feels it feels okay this is in
shade spike which is funny because my
crease if you like the same brow pencil
in the same shades with the same name
but it does feel quite nice to be
further obviously our brows are already
filled in so we're not going to see like
tons of it but it's definitely like made
them look a bit stiff in a bit dark it
just with that a little bit a solution
donor I'm going to maybe try that
another time and I'll let you know and
Twitter or Instagram or just using
another video
because I'm quite invited myself now
that I just felt backed up by religion
and I divided in and I'll feel a little
worse not using it but we all know me
and I just I said I'm doing half time
one thing that I did find that I found
quite interesting it called a freckle
pencil and I've never seen my obviously
a lot of people use my eyebrow pencil
eyeliners themselves to like draw it
crackles on but I've never seen an
actual thing that is designed for
records which I thought was really cool
I don't really not to do this I'm just
gonna like oh oh okay let me zoom it
because buckles are really hard to do
well I think because you're often
dealing quite not until my opinion
otherwise to just look too fake so you
can kind of see what I've done to that
and I was just like ah this looks like
you so I'm literally just going to go in
with a Beauty Blender and no products
you can kind of see them there now I'm
just going to start like jumping over
them and it just really sort of turns
them down the parents wouldn't help good
reviews on the website but I do think
it's nice although it kind of is just
like an eyeliner and you could use just
like any island are any brow pencil are
people use brow pencils so they match
like their eyebrows and but I like the
fact that they've come up with like a
freckle pencil I think I was quite to
you I think it suits Topshop quite well
as well so I'm really got that for now
and I'll go over them a little bit later
if need be
so for bronzer I picked up the bronzer
in the shade Mohawk and it says blend
nuts bronzer onto skin to console and
get warm
it's a buildable coverage so this is the
color of it and there was this one and
one other which I can trim the name of
but this one looks like not as warm
because I didn't want it to be super
warm clerestory bronzes that are quite
like orangey I wanted it seemed more
like a cocky brownie like olive color
which I think this is a locus butter for
contouring as well inside this kind of
shade
oh I'm going to use a brush by Sigma
this is the e I don't even know at 40
f40 yeah at 40 which looks like so it's
pretty much a row graph so just starting
on the
quite sequences yeah if quite pigmented
I'd say like use a light under there but
even one of a plane quite a lot it still
blended out fairly well no no I was
looking at the skin like I really do
quite like the skin I like that I really
do like that Runza because it's just
really brown and like there's not a lot
of our internet after all if there's
like even any and then the fun part
which is highlighter and they have so
many highlighters on the website there
was some cream some powders from like
holographic situations going on and so I
just picked up the standard powder
highlighter that says creamy
highlighting powders to illuminate
skulls and define the face apply the
light reflection formula to cheek and
brow bones and down the center of the
nose and on the Cupid's bow to absolute
dimension and Institute radiance is in
the shade Sun being and I've had one of
these before it looks like this it's
like in the white package in and I had
it in the safe rise in I do still have
it but I never use it because it's too
dark for my skin to be a highlighter so
this is like the paler version am I only
concerned with this right now
which is what I also thought when I
looked it on the website sorry tell is
just like making noise
it's very yellowy like really really
quite yellowy I mean there's gold and
then as yellow and I feel like this is
just like in fact now I'll actually
swatched it mmm I don't think I'm going
to like this right click and click okay
this could be the worst decision and
made on my channel and really good
okay so far so good
it really doesn't like I've used a tiny
spare I'm using a very light hands so
god that looks okay and actually quite
like it it is very yellow like really
quite yellow gold which is not what I'm
used to I usually prefer highlighters to
be a bit more neutral and like just a
little bit cooler but it's nice or
something different so we have got a
palette this is the smoky eye palette in
the shade enigma and and it's got four
eyeshadows which look like so there's
three sort of shimmers and then one
month which is this one at the end
kind of wish there was like another mark
so we should just teach them isn't too
much because I just love a matte Brown
that you guys know and but this is like
my favorite thing to do if I ever have a
palette and I don't have a good map
Brown and look to just use a bronzer so
I'm going to use this as a transition
color first that was the only eye shadow
poly I could see on the website and so
I'm going to use this in the crease and
then I'm going to use like the darker
shade the darker mutt shade and a little
bit of this one in the crease maybe as
well because I might try a bit of
shimmer today in the crease after like
five times and then I got a really cool
little eye shadow and I think this is
one of the chameleon ones it's called
like something because it's like a duo
chrome I've looked a bit though this is
in at the shade youth to end let me just
pop it open how interested does that
look like it looks so cute like drag it
out a little bit here and like wrap it
around I'm really just being quite messy
because I feel like just today I'm just
going to like such a messy look I'm
going to put through this like brown
shade like this one in the crease as
well even though it's gone I mean how
similar is this it's not that bad and
you can I'm just gonna go with it well I
really like this eye shadow color like
this looks really pretty so far I'm
really liking these eye shadows like
they've got a decent amount of different
ation and like super pigmented but the
real available and they blend together
really well like it's easy to layer them
if you know I mean see I'm just applying
that in the answer part of the eyes
and then I'm going to do a little bit on
the lower lash line
unlike the very outer corner click there
and then just sort of like block those
together because I want this out to be
to kind of join I'm going to put someone
like the inner corner as well and then
we're going to put that pigment that
like chroma graphic chameleon situation
thing on the center it's just going to
be like a really bright pop of whatever
it actually is oh wow that's like really
quite right it feels extremely finely
milled like very creamy and very thin if
you know what I mean just like really
fine but it's good because it's like you
can apply it and there's like pretty
much no fallout which is really nice but
I'm yeah I'm impressed with the
pigmentation of the art like because
that was like one swipe on each eye and
that's quite pigmented I have learned it
out a little bit so don't wait like
super interns okay I'm just going to do
some mascara quickly so I got the false
lash intense and just like flat mascara
I think this is the only one I get cute
packaging though it's got little
triangles on the lid and I'm just going
to curl my lashes quickly because I do
actually have nice colorful in salon
brushes quite um the breast on the quite
far apart and they look quite like bit
quite spiky you can see that I'm liking
this because I've done like four coats
and it's not looking quanti and like you
can really build it up a lot and it's
not like yeah it's not clumping my
lashes together because I feel like when
you pull the wand out of the bottle its
creeps like a lot of the mascara off so
it lets me just ask like what you need
light into finish I look and I do
actually really like it what's inside
will prevent the lips
I got a lipstick and lip liner that
looks fun it looks like dark Ashley Wow
and then I also got one of these lips
bullets which is like a map sticks like
a crayon and so the lip liner I got in
the shade beast on
and it does look quite dark but we'll
give it a go and then this map split
bullet is in the shade duvet day which I
really like the name on the thing got
quite cute and that's a lot lighter I
got these because I thought they would
March I should have looked at first
online honestly I'm just calling up
thinking I'll try and do an ombre so
I'll line my lips at this and then I'll
go in with the mops lip situation
already I really like this because it's
like really quite pigmented and creamy
like its glide so well that is honestly
one of our favorite products Ivy's I
look to it but honestly I really like
that lip liner the formula is so nice
that's really rare as well is not as
opaque and but even though it's like
labels me as being my it's very creamy
and then I also did get one of the
actual lipsticks this is in the shade
mercurial I think it said yeah and this
is not a bit of a palette one it's like
a really pale metallic like pink and
it's like a really icy pink so I'm gonna
try like a little bit on the center the
one thing that I will say about this lip
bullet this is not my I love it
personally because it's like not drying
it's very creamy but it's not not like
it's so it's got quite a lot of shine on
my lips which you can kind of see there
and but that's the one thing that I'll
say I love the lip liner and I love this
but it's not much anyone who's thinking
of getting it hmm a lot
I like all them together as I like it
create a really nice ombre lip this
whole look
I'm just feeling it I'm really happy
with waking mouth so this is the
finished look and I want to say I
actually really like the way it came out
like there's not any product Charlie's
just comes the toilet
don't mind him obviously isn't a single
product that I don't like apart from the
foundation which I'm not like the
biggest funnel but it's not bad right
now that the actual full look is done I
really liked weight lock being really a
hahaha that make love Oh shake so much
absolutely be my shameful daddy like you
have let me know what you think in the
comments down below and tell me which
your favorite look is so far I can say
it this one just because it's not
something I would use as well I don't
like the freckles I think they're quite
cute thank you so much for watching I
let me go swimming back and I will see

be like for May we shall see we'll see
