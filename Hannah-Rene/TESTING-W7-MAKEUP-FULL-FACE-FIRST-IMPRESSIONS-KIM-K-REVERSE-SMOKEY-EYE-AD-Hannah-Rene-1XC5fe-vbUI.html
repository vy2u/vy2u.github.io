another testing video because I feel
like I've done one of these in a while
so today I am testing it w7 makeup which
I'm so excited about because as always I
haven't tried anything it from this
brand before and I have to say this is
probably my favorite local this is my
favorite look that I've ever done in the
testing video I feel like the products
work so well I will just say that this
video is in collaboration and it is
sponsored by w7 but you guys know like
I'm always going to give you my honest
opinion on stuff which I definitely do I
tell you what products I like and what I
maybe wouldn't use again at the end of
the video and things like that so that
you can have an idea of what you would
want to get to sell they very kindly
given a 20% off discount code as well
which I believe is just Hannah and all
the information will be in the
description bar below in case you want
to do any shopping yourself so if you
want to see how I achieve this look and
what I think of it w7 products then just
keep watching okay so I've got a
completely a bad face I'm quickly going
to moisturize just because my skin it
needs it and then we're going to start
with skin today I'm really foundation
and stuff is just because I actually
have a specific look in mind that I want
to do today I feel like I've never done
that for the tests and videos I've
always kind of played around like what
there is and I kind of have a look in
mind not really want to do actually done
it in the past but I've never filmed it
on camera and I've never actually
uploaded a photo of it either but I saw
makeup by my obe anyone follows him I
saw him sort of repost the image that
inspired it that you did like it was a
makeup that you did on Kim Kardashian I
can't remember event it was called but
you recently like reposted it it was
from a while ago and it's kind of like a
and what's the word but how did you try
that it's like an inverted smokey eye
not inverted that's wrong word it's
basically like a flipped smokey eye so
it's like a really smokey lower lashline
I'm pretty much nothing on the lid so
I'm going to try and recreate that today
so don't mind my skin at the minute like
I've got excess fake tan on I like a
spray tan and it kind of still coming
off so don't mind me Julian de LOI
and then for primer I picked up the
prime and glow illuminating primer artsy
powder that and which just looks like so
in its little compact from what I
remember on the website there was a
couple of different primers but I picked
this one up because it was the only one
that sort of claimed to be glowy so it
looks kind of pinky in the compact but
when you apply it is kind of like no
tint to it it feels very
creamy which is good like it's not it's
not like it's really it feels
moisturizing not to wear so I'm just
going to like dip the brush in like so
I'm just going to apply it all over
where's my mirror type of way over here
and it just feels like creamy on the
skin like it doesn't feel overly thick
or anything which I guess is a good
thing it feels quite creamy but it feels
quite lightweight at the same time if it
doesn't really feel like I'm applying
like a ton of product so we'll see if it
does the job of prime okay and then for
foundation I've got a couple of
different options so I actually like
picked out the shades and I had ton on
so this is going to be kind of awkward
there is one shade we said that's quite
a lot lighter so we've got the w7 genius
feather-light foundation which looks
like so it's like a dropper foundation
and I'm pretty sure this is supposed to
be like a more natural group and then
we've got the photo shoot Foundation
which is a 16 hour butch proof
foundation and it just says to apply
evenly on the face for a flawless finish
it lasts up to 16 hours and it says it
doesn't transfer onto clothing fiber
which is good but in the shade it's sand
beige that looks really dark for work on
the last one we've got is the w7 HD
foundation at 12 hour this is in the
shade early tan and it just says apply
this light foundation evenly to your
face for the perfect cat walk look I'm
just going to like swatch a couple and
see what's going to work great I'm
definitely going to use this because
this is in the shade or shade is this is
in the shade gloss this is the feather
light foundation the dropper one and
this as you can see it's quite fast slow
so I'm going to mix the high definition
in the shade early tan and I'm going to
mix it with the boss one like the
truffle one and see how it goes okay so
those are what those two look like on
the palette I don't really want to like
hold it too far up because they're quite
runny I'm just going to like mix them
and hope that it forms like it's okay
Shh I mean we all know that I'm not
always the best to like much in
foundation so oh my god those but
coverage oh my god that is like
cupboard straightaway whoa okay
I'm going to like jog it down because my
time is so Pat you on my neck sorry
blue this looks really nice oh my gosh a
little bit goes for a really long way so
like I've not even use half of what
pumped out I mean I did pump out a lot
because I wanted to be able to like mix
it if needs be like adds a little bit
more dark or light but still it's going
a really long way lend onto the net what
I'm really impressed with like how much
left colors like really impressed we not
just blend it out so quickly as well
like so quickly the finish is absolutely
stunning I mean I know it looks really
glowy at the minute I am going to say it
so don't worry too much but I like a
glowy finish so it's all good it's going
to go on top with a buffing brush just
to make sure that it has like settled in
feel like I always am so harsh on
foundations like I'm so picky with what
foundation away I like you all know it's
like I find it hard to find a track to
find a foundation I like sorry so when I
find one and it looks like this go
straight away my friend
okay right I'm going to conceal it okay
so this is the catwalk concealer in the
shade fat this is the lightest shade and
looking in the tube I'm a little bit
worried it's not going to be light
enough for what I like what we're going
to give it a go I know it's not too bad
okay so I'm just going to apply this
under the eye feels quite thin in
consistency like it doesn't feel it
feels quite liquidy again I would say
I'm going to apply a fair bit because it
it kind of seems to like share out as
I'm like spreading out on my skin so I'm
just gonna like do a little bit under
the eyes and like across the king okay
so what blended in so quickly again like
the foundation like blended so easily oh
my gosh I'm really impressed guys like
really impressed feel like this is a
little bit more on the natural side like
it's a little bit more sheer than other
and little computers at you so I feel
like if you go to school or if you just
don't like wearing heavy make
and I feel like you'll like there I
personally prefer my consumers to have a
little bit more coverage and but it
looks absolutely fine and it blended
really well powder this looks a little
bit dark although it's supposed to
translucent so okay this is the catwalk
complexion and powder so it's like the
same range as the concealer it says it's
a silky smooth powder compacts okay so
it's industry translucent in it is it
translucent I don't really know I mean I
have like I know translucent isn't like
no color Bob I don't know we'll see okay
so far so good kind of just like that
didn't really add too much coverage or
anything which I don't like hardest to
do anyway I might do brows next just
because they're looking a little flash
my skin looks so fresh like like I'm in
fun I'm so much beside the club this
look so grown but I swear I paced so
course I want to utilize because I have
a pencil which I never okhta I don't
know I don't know because I basically
have a pencil and then they also have
this at brow parlo which looks like so
and when you open it it's quite cute
actually it's got like a little mirror
at the top and then it's got mini little
crap mini tweezers and then like mini
applicators it's got like a spoolie and
a like an angled brush and then it's got
a wax what's it got what a highlighter
palette and then two brow powders that
I'm kind of intrigued that it has a wax
because something I've always wanted to
do is like watch my brows so that they
sort of like look feathery and like
spaced every successful allele Ellis so
I'm going to treat this little
applicator it comes with and I'm kind of
just going to like I don't know I'm
going to no I mean I just like scoops
and like wax with this like applicator
things I think I don't really now
wondering oh okay I should probably
didn't you in sorry I don't really know
like what I'm trying to achieve I just
want them to be like fluffy how those
brows honey wants to be a lion today
please I'm a Leo for a reason and then
what should you should I use a mini as a
pencil because you know what I've been
using pencil a lot recently like I don't
know why I've just been more of a pencil
peasant brow powder person so this is
the w7 super brows super definition a
draw pencil it comes with like the
actual tantrum and it's got a brush on
the other side this is in the shade
brown the only thing I'm worried about
is if it's going to be a little bit dark
and a little bit too warm but we're
going to give that a go and see how it
goes with always let's change it with
the powder I always like if I'm just
with the demons I always start with like
the tail section just because I don't
want it to be too harsh and at the phone
I'm not going to feel like I'm not - my
brows on camera in so long this is a
good pencil like that's got some serious
limitation yeah I definitely is a little
bit dark for what I want but it's fine
it's fine
I get really creamy so it just sort of
like glides through so I don't really
hard to talk when I'm doing brows this
is why I don't do them on camera oh I
really like this this is good in fact
I'm going to finish these brows off
camera just because the taking ages I'll
be back in a minute all right so they've
turned out very well like Super Bowl
yeah festivals really diffuse and you
guys know I struggle with pencil really
disease and this is really good as well
and I've got browser I think I did yeah
this is the queen of brows um versus the
queen of frost majestic brow mascara
this is in the shade of brown again it
was quite dark like oh my god my browser
dark today look don't worry they don't
find when I makeup start I promise
so it's just got like a little spooley
I'm just gonna like comb through just
like so everything okay so browser dawn
they do seriously look like so bold it's
fine on two eyes okay so I'm so excited
to try this palette this is the w7
mighty map natural news theme up eye
color palette so it basically looks like
this in the packaging it's like a ten
gray container I guess and then you open
it up and as the name it siga it's all
mark so this is what it looks like here
I have to say there's a lot of kind of
very light ones and not as many like
darker ones as I would like but this
brown and particularly here I'm so
excited to use like it's a really lovely
rich chocolate so I'm just going to
start with the fourth shade in which is
called a sex once a girl kind of like
this a media
like warm neutral color and I'm just
going to put this in the crease of my
eye just to kind of give it a little bit
of definition oh that's pretty
okay and then what knit okay so to start
with I'm just going to take that same
shadow that I've just used on top I'm
just going to start smoking this on the
bottom I'm going to bring it like quite
far down because this is the lightest
color that's going to be on the under
eyes so you want it kind of like to come
the furthest down oh my god help us I'll
figure delicious probably going to see
more drastic but I think this is how I
do it last time I'm trying to recreate
in my mind what I did what look because
I really liked it and now something is
always a bit and now I need to make it
look just as gosh so I'm going to take a
black eyeliner this is the DOE southern
it King coal in the shade of blackest
black actually swatch this before and
this is a really pigmented so I'm just
going to pop this in the waterline it's
going to look a little way at first it's
just a black in the waterline but I
promise it will work in the animals I
hope I'm stuffing my waterline it feels
so funny
ah I'm going to take the black in this
palette and I'm going to start watching
that right at the lash line where that
was a sort of liner finishes so far I'm
really liking the shadows and then what
I'm going to do is I'm going to kind of
like stump it so it comes down a little
bit past the KLT area so it comes down
as like a V just because I don't want to
close the eyes up too much so kind of
like yeah so you can see it creates like
a little space and then I'm going to
sort of make all this a straight line
later and this is going to extend a
little bit past as well so it's going to
go sort of like past to create like a
winged liner but I don't want to take it
too far so I'm just going to sort of
like start turning it a little bit okay
so that side has now been extended too
far but it's fine I'm gonna house it
does Co you just want to start smoking
this out we're having all the drama on
the bottom today this black is so
work with but you kind of need to build
it off a little bit to get it to where
you want it to be I would say but it
blends so well which for me like that's
more important when you're working with
like a darker shadow or it's coming
together I can see it now I can see it
coming together you probably can't yet
but I go okay and then what I'm going to
do is I'm going to take the sort of dark
chocolate brown shade here and I'm going
to start smudging this under black into
the sort of outer corner of the top half
of the lid so I know I said I wasn't
going to do too much but just to make it
look right and you kind of want to add a
little bit of definition in the outer
corner so I'm just going to do it on the
lash line I am actually going to do the
whole lash line just to sort of what
would how to make the lashes stand out a
little bit more just make it all look
right oh hello thank God guys I'm
stealing this palette I love Maps like
you all know where I love I got my eye
shadow I'm quite so I'm like you're not
going anywhere tonight although I am
seeing cane in a bit so hey go out oh my
god I'm so feeling there it's not dawn
but I'm feeling out gonna move on to the
other eyes please feeling neglected
well back in with my bigger brush just
make sure everything is like nice
consumer I'm just taking like a little
bit of the fair shade we use like that
kind of peachy shade just to sort of
mash everything together because I kind
of just want everything to blend into
one okay I feel like that's good enough
I feel like without now I mean at this
line Tiny's blending because like I
started off with such like a start line
to the young man I'm just taking a very
tip of this type of brush that I've been
using I'm literally just dipping a set
band and then just very lightly like
enhance in this outer corner and but
because obviously it's a little bit
thicker it's making sure that it's not
too much of a stark liner it's making
sure it's still blended into the other
shade okay so they do have lushes if you
want to get some but I want to stick to
how I did this look when I first in it
and how I was inspired to it when I saw
Mario's look on Kim so I'm using scar
because I feel like my scar is an awful
feeling as done what's going on anywhere
on any way that it doesn't need false
lashes as well so I don't really know
what McCarthy's because there's a
a few I'm going to start with this one
this is the w7 I lost the ultimate
mascara for sexy eyes so so whoo that is
a big brush okay so it just looks like
so I'm probably going to lay like a
couple oh wow okay I want something with
a bit of a smaller one I'm going to try
this one this is the lash tastic false
liquid lash no it's not quite a big one
again but to be fair the bristles are
smaller this one is better select
definition and volume so I'm going to do
the bottom lashes with this one as well
and like because we've got such a smoky
little lash line and don't be afraid to
like to go in with the mascara
okay so eyes are pretty much gone oh my
gosh I'm looking for this okay so I've
just got runs out highlighter and lips
left to do so there are a couple of
different roses I have to say a lot of
them looks shimmery and I'm not really
like a shimmery bronzer kind of person
and I think this is one of the only ones
that was Matt so this is literally
called the bronzer MutS
compacts it just looks like so so I'm
going to give this a go it looks quite
dark well I'm just going to see how it
goes
okay so just watch it on my arm and it's
pretty pigmented I'm not gonna lie it so
I'm gonna try and just use like a really
light amount whew okay my god this is so
pigmented like I literally pop in one
half of the excess and like it still
gives you like a good amount my gosh
this is blending really nicely so this
looks so pretty okay men in terms of
highlighter I've got a palette here
which is the w7 it's globes of glory
illumination palette and it looks like
this inside so it's got a big merit and
then it's got six different shades I
have to say this is this in my opinion
is dark in person than what it looks
like on the website I think I don't know
for some reason I thought these two
shades were going to be a little bit
lighter but this one's quite peachy like
I would probably snoring at me I would
probably use this as a blush like it's
quite peachy and this one I definitely
don't think I could get away with as a
highway are I get some more on the
darker side so those are all six shades
that I'm going to try it this one a top
which you see palest one and
going to apply that on the tops of the
cheekbone or actually in fact I'm going
to use this one as well it's like more
yellowy tones so I'm hoping that it's
going to like pick up I love like a gold
like a champagne gold highlight I'm
going to try that one first and then
maybe go on top with the white doesn't
cut pigment oh oh well then dwell then
we've gotten damn it they're hungry oh
my god I'm I'm living I'm alive it's
literally not one product I've used yet
that looks bad or that I don't like I
want to do too much on the nose I
realize a lot of people highlight the
tip of the nose quite a lot whether I'm
not like a massive fan on it some reason
a front of it I always do about the brow
because I feel like if you've got a
really intense highlight on the
cheekbones and then you don't do the
brow it kind of just look for the arch
okay I do want to try a blush this is
the w7 at cheeky chap multi blush this
is in the shades picnic so these looks
really cute on line because and they've
got like three sort of matches and then
three shimmery shades as well and not
really not to continue you're just kind
of apply it like that on the apples
okay and then last but not least you've
got legs so I've got a couple different
lip liners because they have such a good
range of news like that was the one
thing that I notice that the lip colors
we have so many nude liquid lipsticks
and liners got rushed nude and also very
nude what Russ kind of looks like a nice
in-between like it was not too cool not
too warm either these are the lip
twister so you just twist them up and
they've got as a nice sharp point which
is nice which is so nice very creamy um
blends really well likewise really well
it's got a good amount of pigment so
it's easy to over draw because it
doesn't like because of the pigment like
it still looks like your natural lip
shape does that make sense the liquid
lipstick I'm going to use is the mega
matte lips by w7 again of course this is
in the shade nude nice and simple gonna
apply this in the center and then blend
it Alex it is obviously lighter than the
lip liner okay so this needs a couple of
coats I would say like it's not as
pigmented as some of my as some of my
other liquid lipsticks I came in the
building up a little bit and but it
feels really good it doesn't feel
genital feels really creamy on the lips
which I like definitely more like a
milky formula than a liquidy formula but
I love such nice news so this is my kind
of new because I like quite pale nudes
they do have darker ones if you don't
like news as light as if I feel like
when I've got quite a smoky intense eye
going on I would all be attention on the
eyes and not so much on the lips so yeah
I'm looking at but yeah this is the
finished look so I really hope you all
liked it I have to say this is 100% my
favorite look that I've done with one of
these testing videos but there's pretty
much not a single product I don't mind
I'm not just saying that because I'm
like in collaboration with them all that
you guys know I'm not gonna lie yet and
to be honest won't make up but you can't
lie anyway that you can tell any face if
something's not quite right or if it
doesn't look right or it's not a good
product foundation and definitely
excited to use that again because it
looks flawless honestly it looks
flawless it's not settled into any of my
lines like foundation can sometimes
settle into my smile
it looks absolutely stunning and what
else the concealed out was nice but it's
probably not something I use again just
because it's not a full coverage as I
would like it but if you say need a
concealer for like school or work and
you need something to look natural and
it definitely is a good one I chose
blended like a dream I always say that
we blended it like a dream honestly
really impressive those I'm excited to
try the other palettes because there's a
couple more that I'm not I'm using this
video that I'm assuming will be just as
good roused I absolutely love the pencil
was amazing and I feel like it was
really serious blended really well again
very pigmented the highlight are gross
the lip product really lovely I feel
like the pencils definitely my favorite
and the liquid lipstick took a little
bit more building up but it was nothing
like crazy or nothing but yeah all in
all I'm so impressed so let me know in
the comments if there's anything fun
what do we 7 that you love as well
because I feel like I really want to
test this round properly now and find
like other things that I love just as
much and that foundation I'm that's one
of my favorite things I doesn't like the
foundation it takes a lot to make the
Life Foundation because I feel like
things just look isn't it doesn't look
perfect on my screen I'm like no so yeah
I hope you all enjoyed this video give a
must a bit thumbs up if you did and
subscribe if you're not already let me
know in the comments as well what other
brands you want me to test out because I
would love to know what you want to see
