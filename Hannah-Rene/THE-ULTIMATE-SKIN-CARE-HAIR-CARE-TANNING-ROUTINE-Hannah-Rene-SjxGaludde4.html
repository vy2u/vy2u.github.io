and I'm started filming and everyone
else is in bands so I'm really
self-conscious about speaking to lardo
so sorry for the big quiet hey guys it's
Han so today's video is going to be a
skincare haircare and telling routine
video because I feel like I got a lot of
questions on all three topics but for me
personally like I wouldn't make
individual videos and all three if you
know what I mean so I'm kind of just
throwing it into one big juicy video in
case you ever want to know what products
I use and stuff like that I really don't
want this video to be too long
obviously I'm combining all three things
there's quite a lot of products and
things to talk about so I'm just gonna
go through stuff like as quick as I can
basically say what the product is why I
use it and stuff like that and if you
have any other questions about anything
I talked about let me know in the
comments and I'll be sure to read
through them at that and what an answer
as many as I can I'm gonna start with
hair but I will put on the screen here
at what time I speak about each thing in
case you want to skip to a certain topic
so this is I'm like this is my hair and
it's pretty long as you guys know I've
always had a really long hair I just
love having a long hair it is colored
this isn't my natural color its job this
is darker than what I would usually be
and I get my hair colored at Katherine
Bowden I will leave a link to the salon
down below it's based in sale in
Manchester and yeah I pretty much been
growing my hair since I was like 13
years old I love like I said I love
having long hair I feel like it just
makes your just kind of frames my face
like I can't imagine having short hair
if you don't I mean I got a lot of
questions on how to grow hair those of
you who went longer hair and stuff like
that and I personally don't feel like I
can give a lot of a lot of advice on
that from my like personal experience
with friends and people that I've known
I feel like everyone's hair just has
like a certain length that it gets you
and then stops if you know what I mean
like I feel very lucky because my hair
will just grow and grow and grow and get
quite long but I've had like friends in
the past where they've let their hair
grow and they won't get it caught or
anything like that but it would
literally just stop but like Boop length
and go no further
so for those of you who want longer hair
I want to know how to grow your hair and
stuff I can't really give advice on that
it's may be worth like typing it into
Google or YouTube and finding other
videos I know those like hair
supplements and stuff that you can get I
don't know if they're bit gimmicky don't
know if they actually work if anyone's
tried anything and obviously it
as know in the comments because I'd be
really interested to know as well but
because my ears always just groan I feel
like I can't really advise on how to get
Monday if you know I mean because it is
gross it just comes out my head and it's
nap so all the products I'm going to
talk about is pretty much like keep it
healthy and just like juicy and yummy
and thick so starting with the shower
when you wash your hair you know hi its
first thing I use is the red can diamond
or your glow giant glass scrub which
I've only been using recently it's kind
of like half gone now I've used it like
a good few times how scoops are really
confusing to me like it just seems so
wrong to like put a scrub in you have
you know I mean but I tried this one
time absolutely love day it's the first
thing that I use in the shower I just
get my hair wet and then just kind of
rub this I recently put something up
like in between my hands and then just
rub it into the ends of my hair and it
kind of has these lot of beads that help
it's almost like exfoliating for your
hacks it's like a scrub and but it just
makes my ends a lot more tame I think I
feel like it gets rid of like dead ends
and split ends and stuff really well
makes it a lot easier to brush
afterwards it's kind of like a weird
sensation when you first apply it but I
feel like in the long run it's really
doing good just making my hair healthier
the ends which is really important when
you thought long hair because it can
break easily what shampoo and
conditioner at the minute I'm using the
red can Diamond or your glow drag lot
umph you both these products by red can
actually came in a goodie bag from NYX
itself Thank You next and when we went
to choose him then and I'm absolutely
loving them this like it says it's just
like a shampoo that makes you have super
glossy and healthy and shiny
afterwards it makes my hair really easy
to your brush afterwards I just feel
like it's really moisturizing and
hydrating which is important for me
because one thing about my heart is it
gets really dry and quite frizzy
sometimes and then conditioner that I'm
using at the minute it's the pure ology
hydrate condition this has such an
extreme scent okay it basically knocks
me out in the shower I'm not gonna lie
anyone's tried this it is so intensely
scented with men it's like crazy I mean
it's kind of nice in the mornings when
you need something to like wake yourself
up like this will genuinely not keep the
 out but yeah this is a great brand
of like her cat as well I guess I've
only tried I don't know what they do
other than shampoo munitia next up all
they try jumping ammunition from them
both products I think are quite pricey
so if you want good affordable
alternatives I also really love dove
shell views and conditioners and
a specific light conditioner and shampoo
from the body shop which is like the
green see you on so I'll link all of
them down below but that all just aim to
help like hydrate your hair repair it
just bring life back into it which is so
important for me because it's long it
just dies it dies all the time but yeah
I always use products that I like
hydrate in and is moisturize in the
right way probably just hydrating and
stuff but yeah this is really good as
well makes it really easy to comb out
afterwards and I generally leather drown
myself in shampoo like I just love that
I just think it's the best thing ever
treatment wise I freaking love this
stuff this is one of my favorite thing
in my hair like routine and so this is
by a brand called joy Co and my lady who
does my hair Katherine Bowden basically
introduced me to this stuff because she
uses it on my hair when she colors my
hair and stuff and it is a color therapy
it's called color therapy it lost a lot
by joy joy Co like a little guys and it
is the instant shine and repair
treatment so this is quite a big job you
can get a smaller so this was 20 pounds
I just got it on Amazon and I kind of
used this like once a week or once every
two weeks
I'm just looks like a treatment after
conditioner so once I've washed out my
conditioner my shampoo and stuff I'll
basically apply this from the ends up
until not the very root but kind of like
hair where I still get dryness and
frizziness you leave it in for like
three to five minutes and then just
rinse it out and oh my god it is so good
first of all it smells incredible but it
just makes you have so soft and so easy
to brush like I can't explain it I
really recommend this for anyone who has
like damaged hair that needs repairing
because that's the whole like point of
this treatment is basically meant to
like fix and like rebuild buns are like
broken in your hair through he or
whatever it may be it's just really good
so that's all I use in terms of like
shower bath and like washing onto
styling products the first one is the
batiste dry shampoo in the kind of like
and volumizing edition though this is my
favorite dry shampoo of all time as I
said I kind of wash my hair every like
three days or every four days because I
find it's so much easy to style when
it's not freshly washed it's just as so
much texture and volume was still
absorbent oil so it'd be someone like me
who kind of needs
Chabal um-- and stuff because think with
on karyn's it's so heavy it just drops
and falls to pieces and it has no volume
at the root really from what I like from
my hair anyway so if you're someone like
me who struggles with long hair because
it's quite heavy and stuff and it kind
of just weighs down and you lose all the
volume at the top this is amazing it
just make sure you have so much more
thicker and you Mia and I mean we all
want thinking oh yes definitely get the
volume on if you struggle with volume
obviously hated but I love this stuff I
literally live on it when I need it and
when I'm not like when it's a day when
I'm not washing my hair if you know I
mean when my roots need to him because
my hair grows quite quickly and
obviously grows quite long and stuff
roots become really theirs above me so I
absolutely love the L'Oreal Paris dark
iced brown magic retouch it spray it's
kind of like a weird nozzle like a
little tiny little thing and you just
spray on your roots and stuff but it's
it does such a good job at concealing
them you see use eyeshadow and stuff but
this just does it so much quicker and it
actually looks like more realistic if
you're not I mean it kind of looks like
my hair is like my roots are just
perfect it's a bit messy boys and girls
but it's worth it like it doesn't makes
you how look fresh and brand-new to tame
flyaways because like I said my hair
gets quite frizzy especially at the
fruit this is another one of my faves
this is the John Frieda Frizz Ease
secret agent
Topshop cream situation just use this to
tame a flyaway so as I said I get quite
frizzy at the roots and stuff I got a
lot of like baby has you can kind of see
a little bit especially here as well at
the minute like it's so annoying and but
you just put a little bit on your hand
it's kind of like almost a moisturizer
and you just kind of use it to flatten
your hair and turn flyaways and stuff
it's really good as well because it's
light doesn't mean you have greasy which
I've found that other types of products
like this do and whenever and finish in
my hair off I always use the I never not
say this one it's like Neal Wolfe they
use that super shine spray which
honestly this is the perfect finishing
product it makes you look like you just
stepped out of a salon or off the start
of a hat like you just look so healthy
and glowy and shiny and it's just like a
little spritz cap and you kind of just
you know how it it's you just spray it
on it it just gives you a light it's
really nice shine yeah that's pretty
much every product that I use on my hair
when I'm washing it and when I'm styling
it you've got any questions about the
products that I just spoke well let me
know
comments and I'll be sure to answer them
on to skincare I'm gonna quickly have a
chat about the stuff that I use like in
the mornings when I might cleanse my
face things like that and like the
moisturizers a must that I love as well
one thing that I do want to say about my
skin because you guys are always so
sweet and telling me that my skin looks
really clear and stuff like that which I
really appreciate thank you so much and
to be honest like the biggest part of
that I think and the biggest reason for
me having clear skin is because I'm
actually on Yasmin pelt Yasmin is a type
of contraceptive pill obviously I have a
boyfriend and you know I don't want any
babies oh yeah yes Minh is the
contraceptive pill which I've been on
for like a garish but it's kind of like
a pill that is known for keeping your
skin clear I know a lot of people who
have like acne issues as well sometimes
get recommended to go on to Yasmin by
the doctors even if they don't need it
for the contraceptive reasons just
because it's literally so good so good
at keeping you Sinclar so to be honest I
don't really have to do a lot in terms
of skincare and I just want to say as
well I'm obviously not recommending that
anyone goes on it that's like something
for uni doctor to have a chat about if
you need a contraceptive pill or
whatever I do just want to say please
don't think that I'm like blessed with
clear skin 24/7 it's genuinely 90%
because of my pale like it just keeps my
skin so clear crunchy to remove the
makeup I hate to say this but I use
makeup wipes I'm not even that bad to be
honest I felt is this whole stigma with
using makeup wipes and stuff but they've
genuinely so handy to just remove the
majority of makeup though these are the
simple wipes these are the standard ones
but I prefer the micellar ones just
because I feel like they do a bad job
they're a little bit more moist I mean
they come in a white pack but in general
simple wipes so good you have to break
me out or anything like that they're
just really gentle on the skin if I do
feel like I need to go in with the
cleanser after makeup wipes because a
good trick if you ask someone who has
issues the skin and stuff whenever you
wear makeup it's good to remove it with
a wipe and just do the majority with the
white but then go in with like a deeper
cleanser this is the derma comforting
jelly cleanser which I have mentioned
before I think I mentioned it in like my
yearly favourites because I love this
stuff like it is such a good Thorat
cleanser kind of like a jelly bomb thing
it's like it's really like hard to
explain it but
is literally just like a jelly it smells
amazing as well it smells like lavender
and I also love using this if I'm going
to going to get in the shower and don't
want to do a makeup wipe first I'll just
apply this all over my skin on top of
makeup just kind of massage it in with
my hands and then get in the shower and
rinse off nothing will be on my skin
afterwards it's so good at removing
makeup really soothing really gentle I
use it all over my eyes as well save
I've got like a winged liner on and I'm
making use of all over my eyes and just
kind of like work it in and it doesn't
irritate my eyes at all because some
cleanses will irritate my eyes so bad is
crazy for daytime moisturizer I have
like normal to dry skin so I need quite
like a thick hydrating moisturizer I
love you will know if they get Sunday
Riley CEO and tea box but basically this
little orange part is a lifesaver I
swear by it absolutely a little bit this
is my second one smells like oranges to
start as it smells amazing that's what
it looks like inside this is pretty much
a brand new pot now um but it's just so
freakin good guys Cindy Riley in general
pretty expensive skincare brand pull up
skincare like it's worth the money you
know I mean it all it lasts a good
amount of time I use it every single day
pretty much like they're enough every
single day and it lasted me about seven
or eight months my first one so I know
it's expensive I think it's about sixty
pounds I'm sorry
and but considering you only have to buy
it like once or twice a year I feel like
it's worth the money in that sense you
have normal to dry skin and you need a
good moisturizer look no further
I'm not even kidding like it it's the
best I know origins does a new
moisturizer as well which actually looks
like the same in the pot it's like an
orange part and I've seen Imogen and
Rach talk about it and they rave about
it so if you want something a bit
cheaper that might be a good alternative
and I'll link that underneath this and
I've got to try it personally so I can
comment on it but I know Rach swears by
it and what certain stuff so yeah also
eye cream I never really used to use eye
cream and this is kind of like a recent
addition to my skincare and this is the
Clinique all of our eyes reduces circles
puffs blah blah blah because I usually
do eyes fairs and I basically prime with
a concealer and then set with a
translucent powder my eyes because my
skin is like dry they just get so
flaky I do you see some new branding
moisturizer all over so I use all my
eyes but it just doesn't seem to like
work on my eyes as well that's how I bar
it just hydrates the skin around my eyes
so much better and it makes my base way
smoother because like it got to a point
where my eyelids were so like flaky and
gross that I would prime them and stuff
and then suppling and eyeshadow but like
all dry little flakes would come off it
was just guys it was about situation it
was about time okay dark times but yeah
this little part is a lifesaver
again it's cleaning you come sure it's a
little bit pricey sorry if it is but I
creams I mean that's a good size eye
cream you had that you hardly use
anything do you not I mean okay on to
masks bath time fun time bubble bath
skin care love all that kind of stuff
this part is has honestly changed my
life okay so obviously like my Yasmin
pale really helps with keeping blemishes
down and stuff like that but that's
pretty much it like it doesn't really
help with dryness if anything it makes
you Scott you've done it makes your skin
drier I find and so I still need a lot
of help with like masks and exfoliating
and hydration and stuff like that and
because my skin like I said it does get
a bit flaky this bad boy is the shirt
like it's so good so this is a piece of
Thomas Roth pumpkin and same mask which
I got on cool pcs just because it had
amazing reviews I kind of bought it on a
whim and I had this for months now I
started using it and start the year and
it barely even looks touched because I
do use a really small amount and it's
basically a exfoliating mask so it
smells like pumpkin and it's got these
tiny little beads in them which they're
literally tiny like I've never had an
exfoliator with such small like
exfoliating beads what you basically do
is you kind of get your face wet and
stuff so obviously I use this in the
bath or the shower just because I find
it easy after you like top masks are so
messy
that I'll only use them in the bath or
the shower and then at other times I'll
use sheet masks em so you start with a
dump face and then you basically just
take a little bit on your fingers
and you kind of just massage it into the
skin have to say it does sting of hair
and so you have to be really careful not
to go overboard with like the massage
the massage in the Maserati make sure
you don't like rub it into your skin to
art because it will really
irritate your skin and probably cause
you to break out and I just kind of do
it really lightly and make sure that my
face is nice and wet so it's not like
rubbing too harsh on my skin if you're
not I mean I basically do my forehead
and then I always do sides of my nose my
nose in general just gets a little bit
kind of yesterday a bit sometimes and
then I'll do a cheek carries a bit I
don't need stuccis as much and it always
do much Hin and around my mouth and
stuff basically like mostly t-zone and
then you leave it on for like three
minutes or so and just rinse it off and
I kid you not like every single time I
use this I probably use it like twice a
month because it's quite intense I would
say the day after when I apply makeup my
foundation is flawless it just applies
like a dream I did actually see a
comment in one of my recent videos about
how I get my foundation to look flawless
and like it doesn't look cakey you
because someone was saying that like
whenever they apply foundation and stuff
it always looks cakey on my skin that I
genuinely think that will be because of
like not enough or not a good
exfoliation because I know when it's
been a while since I've used this and my
skin has not been exfoliated properly my
foundation looks a bit like be
honest it looks cakey and like messy and
my pores just it just it's just that
it's all but honestly this is my
favourite thing my skincare oh is it
though this and the moisturizer this and
O'Riley moisturizer and my favourite
things in my skincare nothing compared
to this mask I don't think it's my
favourite again sheet mask really
important I tend to use these after the
pieces Thomas Roth like the pumpkin one
I just spoke about just because it sheet
must usually soothe your skin a little
bit after so they kind of help to like
see there and have a bit of hydration
back in and not make it as it rotates it
and so this is my favorite sheet mask of
all time this is the Sephora Appel base
mask I know it's a bit of a bitch it's a
bar and it's really hard to get your
hands on and but it's just fab they're
really inexpensive there's a bunch of
different like varieties of them they're
just so good but obviously there are a
lot of sheet masks alternatives and
stuff that are uk-based I'll link some
other ones down below that I do really
like and use and I've recently been sent
a pic like a parcel by a face mask
subscription box which probably is my
favourite idea for our subscription box
ever at home so I'll link that down
below because I think that's such a cool
idea they basically send like a bunch of
different face mask like sheet masks
every
and sheet monsters are so good as well
so much less messy than like a proper
full on top mask if you're not I mean
these are just more practical for like
day to day web if I do want to go to the
action mile and say well my skin's
feeling extra dry like recently for
example my nose has been so dry because
I've had such a bad call that I'm
constantly like blowing hair this is the
luna sleeping night oil by Cindy Riley
again so again it's pretty expensive and
a good alternative is the L'Oreal
extraordinary facial oil again
absolutely love that I can switch
between the two so I'll link both down
below yeah this is a next generation or
your reduces the appearance of pores
wrinkles and fights the signs of
premature aging just again makes my skin
really hydrate it feels amazing
smells amazing and it smells like kind
of lavender and stuff so it kind of
actually really helps with like sleeping
as well because obviously it's like all
over your face and stuff and it's pretty
much oh you can smell so it really sends
you off it's like a nice sleep which I
really love as well lastly lip balm my
lips get so dry especially on winter
time if I'm not drinking enough water
this is the Nivea hydro car
SPF 15 lip balm just like a little you
know how it is this genuinely adds a lot
of hydration back in it makes something
a really soothed don't feel drying I saw
like it's just such a good little thing
to pop in your purse and stuff up on
your bedside table like it's just my
go-to at the mix it's so quick and easy
as well I love sticks because you just
whack them on and but yeah swear by this
any vector eye lips give this a go again
it's Nivea so I think it's about three
pounds or so it's really a fraud of all
but yeah that's my skincare if you've
got any questions like I said again like
I said about the hair you've got any
questions about any of the products that
I mentioned or anything I said about
like my pill and stuff I'm happy to
answer anything like I don't mind having
that chat about it and let you guys know
and stuff so that is pretty much that
last but not least boys and girls so
you've got ton in which is my favorite I
love a good turn you know so I am
actually gonna tell you exactly how its
hand in this as well because like I said
I'm just gonna give you all the info in
this video in case you ever need to know
so in terms of a preparation for turn
preparation is so important because if
your skin is not like exfoliated and
relatively
hydrated and stuff like tan will just
not apply very well though I pretty much
everything in my tanning routine is
loved in town which I think a little bit
enzyme called beauty now so it's you
can't get it in the UK pretty easily I
just know it's not the most affordable
thing but one of these tubs like these
little tubes but also have you want to
call them will last me so long guys like
so long I only tan once a week if that
because it lasts so long but one thing I
always do when I'm preparing to your tan
I like to try and do this the night
before if I have to do it the same night
it's not the worst thing in the world
but my tan doesn't come out I've got and
but I kind of like to get a bath and
really soak because like I said I work
time pretty much 24/7 so I've always got
excess tan on which I need to get off
before I start a fresh layer because
building time is a no-no that is tip
number one never put town on top of all
time because it will just look a hot man
so this is what I use in the bath I
basically run a bath
I try and put like a hydrating bath balm
in if I can lush do a really good bath
balm called a bottle bomb I think it's
called just like a little white ball and
it makes your skin so soft and basically
acts as a moisturizer without you
actually having to moisturize and then
once I've soaked for a little bit I use
the loving tan at Tong removing and skin
polishing glove pretty much any
exfoliate of course will do but this is
the only one I've used where it doesn't
irritate my skin and because I've had
the exfoliating gloves by boots before
and they just move my skin like really
bra they were a little bit too harsh or
as this is like actually obviously
designed with ton and stuff and it
removes its hand really well just like a
little glove and you just basically rub
it on your body and stole from your
skin's like being wet and soaked I
definitely said it's like your skin soak
for at least like 20 minutes half an
hour and like good hot bath water just
because it kind of loosens it up and
makes it easy to exfoliate and the Bondi
sun's tan ariza is incredible as well I
don't know I might is gone which is why
I've not got it and but you basically
it's kind of like a mousse and you just
apply all of the skin leave it at least
five minutes and then get in the bath
and stuff or like shower or whatever and
then use an exfoliating glove to take
one off and not really just help as well
so if you you use
which is quite a stubborn talent never
really wants to go never wants to part
ways use it the bond exams Theresa I
generally think it's incredible but yeah
that's what I do in the bath I also I
basically exfoliate then shave like I
always exfoliate before shave but then
I'll just make sure I shave my legs and
God knows whatever else whatever else
you want to show a girl that's up to you
and I do all of that and then just let
my skin like silk and stuff and
was--like whilst my skin's soaking in
the first like 20 minutes half an hour
I'll do you like my masks and things
I've still got stuff to do but yeah
really important to exfoliate and if you
want to shave offices you don't have to
it really helps to give like a smooth
layer when you go to apply try and do
that 24 hours before so try and do it
the night before you know you can at
time just because otherwise she pulls
are quite open I find like my pores are
just like really open and stuff from
shaving and like hot water and things
and so try and do it a day before if not
it's not the worst thing in the world
because to be honest like sometimes I
just don't have the time so I do it all
in one night and it generally just it
doesn't make that much difference but it
just make a bit if you know what I mean
so onto actual tanning and I'm gonna try
my best to include some like lips as
like overlays of me actually using my
tongue and stuff it's a bit difficult
because I was like I'm basically butt
naked it'll rub it moves on my body I'm
gonna try and include some clips and
stuff so that you can see what I do
always so important to moisturize so I
at the minute you can get like specific
ton moisturizers that you use before
turn in but to be honest this is the
best thing that I've ever used for that
so this is by the body shop and it's the
British Rose instant glow body butter is
for like a drier skin
yeah it's 24 hour moisture for normal to
dry skin as I said I'm just quite true
hanging temple my body and my skin is
just dry as so this is amazing for
me I always do my legs fair so first of
all in terms of ton in 99% at the time I
will do a full body tan so I always
start with my legs and just get those
out the way because you know then
they're done and they're just dead I
apply this to my uncle's like all around
my uncles so the backs of my uncle's as
well I apply it in between my little
toes and because that kind of skin area
for me gets quite dry and then I always
apply it on my knees and also on my
bikini line which
I was really rundown but I just noticed
that it makes really big difference when
I do that Sony's bikini line and uncles
and tell who's I apply not too much to
this you don't want it to be like a
lather Don you just want a good amount
so that it doesn't cling to any dry
patches and then as I said for tan I use
love and tan I kind of switched between
the ultra dark like the normal version
and the two-hour Express dark this is
what I've been using like more so
recently which is the Express one and I
do wear it overnight I know it says to
our Express but for me I just don't
really believe in Express tons I feel
like if you won if you want to be super
dark and glowy and bronze like how I
like to be and then I do worse overnight
obviously you can wash it off if you
want and it'll just give you a much
lighter like natural color but I like to
do wrongs girl I like to be dark and I
use a mitt I use a map all over my body
including my face this is a Zen time
there um and I love this mirror I feel
like it's the best mate I've used loving
tan do you do emit but I just think it's
the kind of mitt that's quite soft and
caution like and I don't feel like they
work with mooses at all so yeah I like
to use quite a thin mitt and San Tropez
do really good mitts as well the only
thing about those is they kind of leak a
lot of me like they break out at the
sides and leak all over my hands which
is just a hot mess so Zen time it's my
favorite and I get them on Amazon Prime
with the two-hour Express I will say I
find it harder to blend than the ultra
dark because it seems to dry quicker on
the skin and so I pretty much do kind of
smaller sections so I start with my like
the bottom half of my legs my calves and
I do one pump on my calf and I basically
pop it on the glove and then just start
blending it in it to my leg and make
sure that you don't apply too much on
your feet so a big trick for making it
look natural is to not apply too much on
feet or hands because those areas really
pick up time quite heavily so they only
need the tiniest amounts of balance out
with the rest of the body or I apply the
whole pump to the leg and then with
whatever's left over on the glove I'll
do my feet and my toes and stop and not
saying and I just do the rest of the
legs like usual I do I do like two or
three pumps for my upper legs because I
like blend it onto my balm and they're
not my hips and things like that because
like I said I do do a full body and I
was
you just want to blend around the knees
and things like that as well after legs
I do face necks and I oh I do have four
different products actually which I
don't have with me at home but I'll link
it down below it's basically a tan it's
kind of a liquid tan that is made for
the face and Holly Holly Baron if anyone
watches Holly's videos she recommended
it and hurts any video and I picked it
up gave it a girl absolutely fell in
love with it so again I do use it with
the men you could use it with a brush if
you want it to but I feel like because
it's a liquid I don't know I feel like I
just preferred doing it with a mitt
because I then do go over a little bit
with ton as well just to make sure it
all balances out in terms of the color
and then do one pump on my neck so I do
one pump on my neck kind of make sure I
get around the back of my neck and the
back of my shoulders and stuff I
basically jog it down my collarbones and
then I'm too late bubi area and then I
do another pump I'm like my boobs head
down onto my stomach and stuff and that
again takes one pump for me I'm trying
to just like tell you as detailed as I
can how I apply my time again once I've
done at my chest area I do my stomach
and again that is one pump so I just
apply it I've got so much where I
moisturize here so I go back in after I
do my legs I go back in with the body
butter by the body shop and I noise ties
in between my pants which is really
running but I feel like my skin that's
quite quite dry that not dry boy sweat
like tan is most likely to peel off when
I'm like when it's been on for a couple
of days so we're always moisturize bad I
do a little bit on the sides of my
armpit just because again if I ever kind
of like once I've had time for a couple
of days if I don't moisturize that gets
a bit scaly and then I always do my
elbows and lots of my hands like I've
got a mount on my hands in my wrists
yeah one pump on the neck one pump on
the chest one pump on the stomach and
then start doing the back which is
pretty hard I can only really do my
lower back anyone who can do a full back
of time by themselves is a goddess like
honestly I don't know somehow anyone
knows that and I pretty much just kind
of burn my arm around my back and stuff
it's a lot of just awkward angles and
stuff and you just kind of have to find
your way around and but I just do a
little bits here in that because I don't
like to apply it too much when I do my
back because I usually can't blend it
all out properly if you not I mean once
I've done my face my neck my chest on my
stomach I then do each arm and
army takes one pump and then half a pump
after so I do one full pump on the glove
and do all at the backs of my shoulders
and like my arms and stuff and then it
kind of comes down to like about hair on
my forearm so I do half a pump then and
just kind of go over everything and then
again with the excess and only the
excess don't put a lot in your hands
that's the mistake I used to make when I
was younger
and it looked for unders literally with
whatever's left over on the glove no
additional product just do your hands I
when I do my hands I basically do like
the front of my hands obviously I do
each finger so I take the met and do
each thing on my thumb and then I do
also do my palms as well and I only do a
little bit but I never used to do my
palms and it kind of always looked a bit
arch so I do like to do its how many bit
on my palms just so it all blends in
with like my wrists and things because
you don't want any kind of like
chalkiness and bits here that just look
wrong make sure you do right in the crux
of your fingers as well because they
tend to get left out and then the last
thing I do is I make a little fist so
details I know I make a little fist and
I just run the mitt against my knuckles
and my thumb knuckle because again
knuckles can get left out a little bit
and then when you bend your hands and
stuff like it's always white in between
your knuckles and it looks weird after
like I said applying a good amount of
moisturizer to your hands because your
hands are something you can't really
hide let's be honest like if you mess it
up on your chest and you stomach it's
fine you can usually hide that but your
hands you have to get right so like I
said no extra product for them literally
whatever is left over from doing your
hands on the gloves like less is more
trust me and and then just do all the
nooks and crannies and stuff and just
make sure you blend in it really well
check all different angles in the
mirrors like this side of the arm tends
to get left out a bit so check that in
the mirror and yeah and make sure you
blend it down from like the armpit down
the sides of your body if I'm like going
out and I really need my back do it and
then I'll get my mom to help me because
like I said I can't do it by myself I
have like this gap in the middle of my
shoulders that just I can't reach and so
I always like get someone to help you if
you need to but other than that like I
just leave it unless somewhere in
something backless it doesn't really
matter to me and then like I said I
sleep in there I sleep in the two hour
Express don't feel
have to if you wanna wash it off that's
absolutely fine that's what it's there
for so that you can like do a ton
quickly and get it off but when I wash
it off in the morning and I just put my
hair in a bun and stuff and I hop in the
shower I put the shower on like kind of
a soft power like you don't want
anything super powerful if you know I
mean so try and get in like it's
culturally would say but should I make
the shower quite like soft and weak up
in the shower like I said not super
powerful or anything like that
lukewarm water nothing too hot because
that will take more time off and just
kind of like this sounds really weird
but just done there and just like do all
different movements like make sure you
lift your chin and stuff in your head so
that it all gets and your neck and stuff
you just want to make sure it rinses the
entire body because you don't want to
get out and have any like tongue that's
still dripping and running off and you
can always tell when your body's done
because the water in the shower will
just run completely player but yeah like
I said no so I do like to use the
tiniest bit of like body wash on my
underarms on my vajayjay just because
like to keep clean and stuff and because
those areas don't really matter as much
for literally the tiniest bit you don't
want to use soap on any other part of
the time of the body because it will
just make it look a bit like icky and
then after that you're all done
I feel like this was the longest part of
the video and I hope I like explained it
well enough I just wanted to make sure
that gave you like the full shebang
about how I do it and then was in a
world training glue clips if I can yeah
that was pretty much everything so I
really hope you all enjoyed this video
like I said if you've got any questions
whatsoever let me know in the comments
down below and I'm sorry it's been a bit
quiet and but yeah I'm gonna go because
my throat is on fire so thank you so
much for watching I love you guys the
moon about million times over and I'll
see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
