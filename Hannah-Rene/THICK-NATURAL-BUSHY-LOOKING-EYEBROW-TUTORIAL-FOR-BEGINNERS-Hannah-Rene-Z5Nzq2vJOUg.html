brow routine because I feel like it's
been a forever literally forever since I
last uploaded a brow routine I do have
one that's like maybe a year or so old
but I ramble so much in that video and I
know a lot of people got pissed off when
they watched it so I thought I would do
a new one and show you my updated brow
routine because it has changed a lot
anyway like I do my brows a lot more
fluffy and sort of sick and hairy know
if that makes sense a lot of you have
been complimenting me recently on them
so thank you so much I'm really glad
that you like them they are a lot more
like natural and hairy since I've had my
microblogging done which I will quickly
mention in a minute but yeah it's a very
simple brow routine it takes me like
five minutes in the morning to do also I
have just a bit two veneers put in so if
I sound like I have a lisp or I just
some weird in this video don't mind me
I'm still like getting used to like the
feeling of them but yeah I just have
them fitted these are the temporary ones
I've only got two in and I do speak
about almost snapchat if you want to
know like more about it but if I sound
really funny or if I sound like
different or if I've got like a lisp or
anything don't mind me I'm just getting
used to them and yeah I mean that's
everything so if you want to see how I
got my brows just keep watching okay so
I pretty much have everything except
brows and lips done so I'm going to do
brows them and I'll just do it lips
off-camera
don't want to talk too much it in this
part because I feel like in my last hour
tutorial the thing that I hated the most
was the fact that I just rumbled for so
long so all you need to know is that I
have had my eyebrows micro bladed so
naturally they do have more shape to
them than they usually would I got the
micro bladed by a lady called Michelle
in Manchester who runs mic related
Manchester I'll put a picture on the
screen of what my brows were before and
after with Michelle's Instagram in case
you're interested in getting them done
and she was doing an offer at some point
as well where if you wanted them do in
and you basically said you were referred
by me she would give me 50 pounds off
I'm not entirely sure if she's doing
that anymore and but yeah I have them
isolated because they weren't naturally
very sparse I wanted a little bit more
shape to them for days when I don't have
makeup on what 100% recommend the
treatment I absolutely loved it I did a
vlog on it as well which I'll also put
on the screen which is on my second
channel but yeah I just want to tell you
that that microwave I definitely would
recommend getting them done if you have
more sparse brows and you may be like
don't well of makeup or you want
naturally follow brows without having to
fill them in like so much every single
day
that being said I
so I don't really need to sell them in
at tons and tons but I like to just add
a little bit of volume and thickness
whilst sort of like darkening them a
little bit because obviously my hair is
dyed at the Monaro the products I'm
going to start with is a brow pencil and
this is the benefit goof proof brow
pencil in the shade number four and it
comes with the actual pencil and then
it's also got like a Kobe brows as well
which I really like I don't like using
and brow pencils for my entire brow
because I find them difficult to work
with
I just prefer using a brush such as me
and put the thing that I like about them
is they are obviously creamier than a
powder because they are like a cream and
texture and this one in particular by by
benefit sorry is so super creamy I use
it towards the tail of my brow and
basically comb it through and the ends
and that helps to create a base for the
powder that I'm going to use later so I
literally just apply it towards the end
of the brow where I want a little bit
more thickness and it creates a really
nice base as I said so it makes sure
that the powder goes on nicely and it
just makes the brow look more textured
in general on each side of my brow that
are less slightly less hairs underneath
than the front anyway even though I've
had the micro bladed I do like to fill
just because I've changed the shape that
I do with my brows and since I had them
microwave so I basically just fill in
the end portion and just do a little bit
underneath as well but I'm literally not
neat with your asshole because this is
just the base product and as I do that I
just sort of comb my hair through just
to make sure that the product isn't like
sort of gathering at any one pie make
sure that everything is blended and
because we are going for like a more
bushier brow look anyway I make sure all
my hairs are always brushed or there's a
point as well like if you're brushing up
your hands and they're too long we just
trim the top of them I just use nail
scissors but mine are okay at the MINIX
I did them like the other week so the
brow powder that I've been loving is by
Sigma and it comes in a little pot like
so this is the medium brow powder and
you get to a different shade you get a
dark one and a more paler one because my
hair is dyed at the minute I am using
the dark one and I feel like it just
matches really really well the powder
itself blends really well and I also I
also use it to fill my hairline in a
little bit as well where it's sparse and
it's quite cool tone which I really like
because again my hair's like not
particularly warm so I like to have a
zoned brow powder to use the brush that
I use is the same brush I've always used
this is the only brush I will ever use
aroused I love it so much this is the
Mac two to six and is the short-handled
version just because it's like cute and
dinky nice to travel and but it's
literally just an angled shadow brush
you can use it for like gel liner and
things like that as well but personally
my hair at useful it is for brows and
evolution set and I've always looked it
so this is what I'm sticking with the
motion that I do is the motion that I've
brush my head up in so I literally just
take my brush with the product on and I
just flick it upwards
really gently like I don't press it hard
down on my skin because I want to create
a natural look and I don't do what I
used to do anymore where I sort of like
carve out the end here like I do a
little bit if I need to but for the most
part I do flicking motions so I start
from the bottom of the brow and flick
upwards through the hairs and that helps
to create like the more hairy look if
you know what I mean that's another
reason why I only use the pencil towards
the arch at the brow as well because
obviously when you using the powder
especially if you use a light hand and
it comes off a lot less dark than where
we did the pencil and I like to have a
slightly lighter in a corner as opposed
to like where the arch in the tail is
and then all I do after that is I just
set it in place with a brow gel so the
brow gel that I love again is by benefit
this is the Gimme brow and the reason I
like this is because it has almost like
little microfibers in which again just
like adds to the texture and make them
look like extra hairy you know we want
them to look Harry this is in at the
shade 5 and I just pull it out and just
scrape the excess product off again it's
nice and cool toned and it matches my
brows really really well and so I pretty
much just comb it through and again I
brush my hair upwards because we want to
keep that look of them looking bushy and
hairy so this is the finished look with
the rest of the make fun elections put a
lipstick on and we are good to go I
really hope you all found this useful
let me know in the comments if you have
any questions about hiding my brows or
about the micro bleeding process or
anything like that I will be happy to
answer any questions that you have other
than that I don't think I have anything
else to say so thank you so so much for
watching I love you guys the moon and
back and I will see you in Thursday's
video which hopefully will be the
hourglass testing video which I'm so
excited about it's what I've got on
right now and I'm excited so you'll know
it so thank you for watching I love you
