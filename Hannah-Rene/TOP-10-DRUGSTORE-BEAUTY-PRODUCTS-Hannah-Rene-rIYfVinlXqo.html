of all don't mind my voice because if
you follow me on twitter you'll know
I've not been very well this week hence
why there was no testing Tuesday on
Tuesday I really wanted to go on up but
I literally woke up and she's someone in
or Monday morning maybe and I just felt
like yeah yeah I feel like I'm getting
back to my usual self now so if I'm a
little bit quieter and like down and
just sounded like a man in this video
you know why I really wanted to get a
video up today and when I mentioned it
during this video last week I know a lot
of you got excited I really wanted to
see it and stuff don't you think I've
done one of these on my channel before
might been ages ago and I might have
private it now because I got so picky
it's still thinking about what videos I
have on my channel so today's video is
going to be my top 10 current favorite
drugstore products so pretty much all
these is like two that aren't
specifically from the drugstore you have
to get them like online but they're all
like really affordable products and most
of them are from boots and Superdrug
of course so I thought I would sit down
and have a chat with you and share them
with you yeah I'm just gonna get
straight into it because I really don't
want to speak for any more any longer
than I have to because my throat
honestly is on fire yeah so the first
thing that I want to talk about is
concealers by Maybelline so I actually
picked two out because I feel like when
it comes to concealers Maybelline just
really knows her stuff fit me concealer
in particular it's probably my all-time
favorite which is this one here this is
in the shade 20 it's actually brand new
not been open it's like a fresh little
pot and then I also have the age rewind
I'm not sure know this is like such a
long-running name but it's just like a
little twisty one that's the witch but
yeah fit me was a favorite of mine for
so long like if you've been watching my
videos for a while then you'll know that
I used to use this in so many like
tutorials and get ready with me and I
feel like when I started using NARS
radiant creamy it kind of took its place
just because I find NARS radiant creamy
to give me a little bit more coverage
they're very similar in fairness and so
if you do want something similar to the
NARS radiant and you maybe don't want to
spend the money on it or for whatever
reason fit me is a really good cheap I
would say the thing that I love to buy
under the eyes as well is it's really
hydrating like my skin gets quite dry
especially under the eye area so I have
to use a concealer that's like really
hydrating and creamy which I find this
one to be and the shade range isn't the
best that's the only thing I kind of
mix between it this was a bit dark for
me I don't know why I've got 20 but I
kind of mix between at ten and fifteen
and it's a bit weird because 15 is
actually lighter than ten I don't know
how that ended up to be but that's just
the way it is and then and the age
rewind like the twisty one it gives a
little bit more coverage and I find it
to be a bit thicker so I do like using
it but I just use a little bit less than
I would fit me and because it kind of
blends out a little bit more heavier if
that makes sense like it's a bit more
full coverage and it's more likely to
crease on my under-eye personally so I
just don't like to use it as much
because I can always rely on this one
where as a drawing kind of like looks a
little bit cakey on me sometimes it just
depends like how I use it
next thing I want to talk about is a
highlight palette this is by NYX NYX in
general as a brand is probably one of my
favorite like affordable drug store
bonds just because I feel like in terms
of the brand as a whole and like all of
the products overall like they just nail
the most stuff so this is the NYX stroke
of genius palette I'm pretty sure this
is like for a while I thought this is
limited edition but I'm pretty sure like
it's not it's like a permanent product
and it's still in stores and stuff and
it's really really pretty like so pretty
so it's basically just a palette of
powder highlighters as you can see this
one up here is my favorite just like a
really beautiful kind of champagne gold
and you can see like the pigmentation is
just no joke they didn't come to play
okay another highlight palette that I
really love is the sleek um Saul STIs
palette which I love but at the same
time I only use like one shade or maybe
two shades in that because two of them
of creams and like I'm just not a cream
highlighter person and whereas I feel
like this one is like a similar quality
like they're both super pigmented and
they apply really well and but this just
kind of has like more of what I want set
all powders if that makes sense okay and
then I've got a couple of lip products
that I want to talk about again all from
the drugstore so the first ones are lip
liners and these are by Rimmel so as a
lot of you know Ramona has like a really
special place in my heart because my
first ever like proper shoot when I
started doing YouTube was with Rimmel
and then it not so long ago I did the
Rimmel road trip with Victoria or like
in the fro and in Manchester and like I
just love working with them they're such
a lovely brand to work with like I just
love the people I love the products
because I've done like a bit of work
with them I feel like I've really tested
a lot of the products and the lip liners
are one of the things I just absolutely
love and swear by so these are both
lasting finish lip liners they're like
the actual kind of like call sharpen
pencil liners if that makes sense I have
two shades here one is in one and one is
in the shade it's her masu which is a
more sort of like brownie nude which I
actually got into after the Rimmel road
trip with it sorry because I know that's
one of her favorite so it's kind of like
just like a pale brownie nude and then
the one that's been like a favorite for
ages of mine which I've been using for
ages is spice which is kind of like a
similar shades like muck spice I guess
it's just a little bit more pinky so
it's kind of like soar to be honest but
as you can see it's a little bit darker
I just love the way these apply they
apply really nicely on the lips they're
really easy to work with them I create a
shape with and that makes sense
they don't tug on the lip so I need them
like that because I feel like with some
liners sometimes including like
eyeliners as well that I actually like
pencils I feel like sometimes they feel
a bit more drying and they called the
formulas but these just apply really
nicely blend really well with other lip
products and stuff and I'm pretty sure
they're about 4 pounds 5 pounds each and
then going on with Rimmel lip products
this is kind of like a new addition to
their family it's one of the stay matte
liquid lip colors which if you watch my
tutorials and stuff I can't remote video
I use this in I feel like it was a full
face of first impressions when I live
back in the flat maybe yeah mr. banks I
remember wearing it in a video that I
filmed man this is in the shade lot
eight to go that is the shade there in
the middle it's one of my favorite
drugstore liquid lipsticks of all time
like I remember when I first tried this
in the first impressions I fell in love
with that I wore it for like four days
straight after that I'm really
comfortable on the lips they do need a
little bit of build in from what I found
and not tested like many other colors
other than this one cuz this is just
like a go-to nude for me and but it does
need a little bit of build in the thing
that I love though is because it's quite
a movie for me like it just feels really
comfortable on the lips and it doesn't
really feel sticky or anything like that
still dries matte and stuff but it's
just really comfortable pretty sure
these are about eight ish pounds
I say love them absolutely love them
they remind me a lot of being NYX soft
matte lip creams as well but they're
just a little bit bigger and I don't
know I just preferred the formula it's
tiny bit more because I feel like
they're a little bit more okay okay and
then back onto a NYX asset so one thing
that I knew I had to mention one of the
first things that pops into my mind when
I knew I was going to be filming this
and this is one of the NYX butter
glosses and it's in the shade fortune
cookie
so again NYX lip products in general
really do love them I feel like they're
really good for the money this like lip
combo it actually really nice with the
Rimmel liquid lipstick so fortune cookie
is at the bottom it's got a little bit
more of a pink tone to it but what I
love is you can kind of see that like
the amount of shine that you've got from
butter glosses like they just make the
lips look really like wet and juicy if
you know I mean we all want to see let's
you know we do and I just love the smell
oh my gosh if anyone has a bottle
glasses you'll know but they smell so
good they smell like vanilla cookies or
something they're like my favorite
smiling product out of every makeup
product ever and again I think they're
about five okay and then on to a mascara
I never thought I would see the day
where I would feature a mascara in like
this type of video because anyone like I
feel like a lot of you know I just do
not gel with mascaras really like it's
not something for me to just like the
love of mascara if you're not I mean
like connect today is all about the
lashes the false lash life so shouldn't
really care for mascaras is not but this
one I I think I mentioned this on
Twitter a while ago but I actually
picked this up after watching Emily like
Emily Canham video on it
and she did a video where she spoke
about how she gets her lashes really
long and how they stay curled and stuff
like that and honestly I'll link the
video down below because her lashes are
insane like it makes me so jealous this
is the mascara that she used first and
I'm pretty sure she's mentioned this a
lot and she's used it for ages because I
feel like I've seen it in a couple of
other videos as well but it's the Max
Factor 2,000 calorie waterproof mascara
oh my god it is like it's magic honestly
I don't know what they put in this stuff
but it's much it the way I use it is I
just curl my lashes as usual I just use
a
number seven lash curler just apply like
one coat of this and then just do the
other side and then just wait for it to
dry it and then do another coat and so
so on so far and like I can't explain
like how shocked I was when I first use
this because my lashes genuinely stayed
like as curled as they were as soon as I
killed them with the lash curler like it
was just it was insane all I think
that's annoying is that obviously
because it's waterproof it's a bitch to
go off like I need please can someone
tell me a good product to get waterproof
mascara off because I just don't want to
use like I don't know other artist ends
up living on my lashes for ages and in
one way that's kind of like bad because
I feel like my lashes just so I get
stopped yeah because there's like excess
and scarlet I can't go like I don't look
after them enough you're not gonna lie
but yeah swear by this thank you Sam for
recommending that because she was not
joking like honestly this is an insane
mascara and again drugstore really good
for the money I'm sooo Italian product
again this is by Rimmel this is an
instant time which is actually the
product that I use when I did my first
ever shoot with them and it's kind of
funny because like I'm just not a liquid
tan kind of person like this is obvious
like a liquid in a tube and I'm more of
a mousse person like I just find that
mousse is blend really easily on my skin
lasts a lot longer
obviously this is wash off anyway so
that doesn't really matter and I just
feel like they blend a lot easier on my
skin I feel like with liquids hands and
it's just more likely to go patching
stuff with a man I don't know what it is
I was just obviously using the wrong one
I got this one by Rimmel they do it in
different colors and they do it in a
matte and a shimmer finish
I believe I always use the mat just
because I like I like to kind of have a
matte base and then if I want to add
highlighter to my body I will I don't
really like to have like the whole alone
for shimmer if you know I mean I always
got the dark one because you know I like
to be done this stuff just is amazing
honestly it's kind of scary
when you look at it because I don't know
if you can see in the lid but it is
actually really talked and when you
first like squeeze it out onto the mitt
you kind of like Lisa because like it
looks really dark um but it just shows
out really nicely it blends in really
well the thing that I like as well it's
because it's not a mousse and it's
obvious like a liquid and wow if you're
not I mean and it doesn't dry down as
quick so it's like you've got more time
to work with it and it just kind of
melts into the skin if you don't mean
like I don't know what it is like it's
just really easy to apply it really easy
to use like even mom it's somewhere in
the house right now but even mom can do
my back with this and it looks ten out
of ten like she nailed it every time
because it's just it's honestly
foolproof it's so easy to use not that
my mom has a full she's not it says it's
water-resistant as well I'm not really
convinced on that because it just washed
off quite easily but it's just something
to my mind can't wash your hands what
this is aren't sorry okay this is
product number seven no eight nine ten I
think this is product number eight I
think I've got sad
unless I'm just like counted wrong but
this is the last one that's like from
the drugstore
I guess so that you can buying like
boots and Superdrug this is by soap &amp;amp;
Glory I love so glowing all my favorite
drugstore brands I just think they're so
fab I love like the whole brand in and
just like LeBron themselves I could just
sent my father
this is lines body sprays and it's in
the flavor I guess fruit to go which I
went when I first read this like years
ago and it was the weirdest thing
because it literally smelt like my
ex-boyfriend which is so way but I
remember I went to a Christmas party
with the girls from so from glory last
year and I was like telling them the
story about how like I sprayed it and I
was like oh my god it smells like my axe
what is that about and they basically
saying about their fruit to go Sun is
more like a unisex scent so it's kind of
like girls on blues if you know I mean
and which i think is really cool because
it definitely has like kind of compares
like some of the other scents by circle
glory which are really like floral e and
fruity and like super girly and stuff
and I think this one is definitely like
a nice in-between I guess it kind of
gives you got like or you smell as well
I don't know if I'm making any sense
yeah I love it I just walk it in my bag
wherever I go super handy for just like
touch-ups are we going stop because it's
plastic as well don't need to worry
about it like breaking or anything they
never leak or anything like that and I'm
pretty sure you can get bigger sizes of
these as well but I just like the little
minis because you can just like throw
them in your bag and they don't take up
too much space
smell this because it smells really
yummy it's probably my favorite I can't
say that actually because they have so
many good sense but it's my favorite
like body spray scent it's my favorite
thing to spray if you're not I mean okay
now which has got two things left which
as I said aren't technically drugstore
but they are affordable and I wanted to
include them in this video because I
loved
and use them just as much as the other
products if not more so the first one is
by w7 and that video like whites has two
w7s so on my favorites today just
because like I really love the makeup
like I just love the way the look came
out and I was so blown away with with
like all the products and but this one
in particular this is one of the
foundations it's the genius for the
light foundation this is in the shade
buff which I believe is that pale is
like fairest shade and I remember using
this first for the first time and I mix
it with another one of their foundations
because it was too light for me and it
still is a lot of the time just because
I wear fake tan a lot and I just love
the way it made the other one because
it's quite like I don't know if you can
hear but it's quite a liquidy foundation
it's like a it's like a drop be product
if you know what I mean I'm so super
liquidy but I just love the way that it
works with thicker foundations because
there's so many foundations that I have
in my collection that are just like too
thick and heavy for my skin but I love
like I love the way the product looks if
you're not I mean and I love the finish
and the coverage and stuff like that but
my skin it just cannot tack it because
it's so friggin dry so one of my
favorites mix it with is the Becca
ultimate coverage complexion cream which
is literally likes men like it's so
thick if you need a good full coverage
foundation you will love that and then I
mix this in my I think I mix it in my
own estancia testing video with the
anasazi a stick which I initially didn't
like because it's like a really dry
matte stick in my opinion mix it with
this and again I love like the finish of
it I love my foundation it just it's
like a little bottle of magic it's just
so good it makes any foundation look
better for my skin so if you normal to
dry you will love this obviously you can
wear it by itself as well I just don't
because it's quite a fair shade and I
imagined it to be a more natural
foundation just because it is a bit more
liquidy and stuff like that and it never
really seems to add coverage to my
foundations and it just helps with like
the fluidity and like the texture and
stuff like that and I just love it for
the price as well W so in a bargain
you'll love it ok last but not least
boys and girls we have brushes at home
which I've mentioned these a couple of
times I think I mentioned them in a
favorites video not so long ago and
obviously I do use them in a lot of my
videos anyway and but these are the back
sage Beauty
brushes so I have three hair and I do
have all the brushes that they do but
these three I definitely like my
favorite ones and the ones I use the
most and so I've got two eye brushes one
is just like the large eye blender which
looks like so and then one is just
called the eye blender which is just
like the smaller version in the more
tapered so for me this one the bottom
one here the large I blender is kind of
like a 2 2 a 2 2 filled by Mike yeah 2
to 4 by Mac which is like a large
blending brush and then the like the
normal blender brush is more like a t17
99% the time when I do eyeshadow I only
use like these two or like the Mac t17
in the Matthew t4i literature she's like
two blending brushes and then a lip
brush I just feel like it just does the
job and it's just super easy and quick
and and in terms of like the quality
again these are super inexpensive and
they're really soft guys like they're so
soft like unlike matte brushes which got
a bit scratchy on my eyes these I can
just blend with for days like I can also
just sit and do my makeup for days
because they're so soft on the eyes um I
just thought I think they're about 7
pounds each I do have a discount curl
which I'll link down below if not easier
obviously don't think that you have to
is an affiliate code if you want to know
but it gets you Thompson off which makes
them even more of log in and then this
brush right here is the I think is
called the buff or no it's not I think
it's called the foundation brush on the
website this reminds me a lot of the
Real Techniques expert face brush if
anyone has that or loves it again one of
my favorite brushes ever and I just find
it so good looking so honey to have lots
of brown top kabuki sort of like boffin
brushes you can never have too many of
them because you know I can never be
asked to clean my makeup brushes that
let's be honest I just like to have spa
ones so that I can put it off as long as
possible and to be honest like they're
good for everything like I use this for
foundation but then I'll also use like
this on my Real Techniques one for cream
bronzer when I do that here just because
it's like the perfect kind of shape it's
just like not too skinny and it just
kind of gets right into your cheekbones
if you're not I mean but yeah absolutely
swear by these as you guys will know
because I do use them in videos and the
normal eye blender is what I always use
on lower lash line
because I do see people asking about
that it just fits like perfectly and
because it's like still a blending brush
just makes everything really soft
combats like a pencil brush which kind
of just like in my opinion just like
slap some part out and then just like
leaves you like what do I do now also
lashes by backstage PC I'm wearing the
style of these Melrose Avenue I'm
wearing those right now they do really
good lashes as well so I'll just link it
all down below in case you wanted to
know what lashes are eyes today is the
Jaclyn hill palette I finally tested
their um quite interesting palette like
some of the maps are quite dry I found
this is like a complete like off the
subject stop it now um but yeah I do
like it so I'm gonna like the way the
eyes came out kind of I definitely
changed the lid color I don't know why I
put such a pale shade on but the matte
some of them are quite dry and they were
really wet making my eyes look dry I was
just like wow yeah I'm gonna stop
rambling because I need to go get a cup
of tea I just got into bed and died
