going to be a short sort of mini video
on my pot three drugstore pants and my
top three hand pellets because I on time
said if anyone wanted to see this and it
got a lot of those on the home
it's almost few do yeah I basically
picked out my three favorite drugstore
pallets or sort of like affordable
pallets if you like and then also my
three favorite high-end pallets that I
just think any makeup lover should have
in your life I just thought this would
be a relative video because I do see a
lot of people tweeting me asking like if
certain pilots worth the money or like
which once again if you're going to get
one other so I thought I would tell you
my top three in the ones that I really
recommend and really love and if you
want to get any then feel free so I'm
going to start and with the third one
and then I'm going to work my way up to
the one that I like the most and the one
that I would like 100% recommend so the
first one is by stealer this is there in
the light palette and I'm pretty sure
this is one of the first time I ever
actually oh and if you can get in Boots
I'm pretty sure it's about 20 or 25
pounds I want to say so it's not
obviously like super super affordable
and I definitely think it's worth the
money so you get I think it's format and
the rest shimmers yeah one two three
four one two three four times yeah so
you got four months and six shimmers and
as I said this is my first
aberrational this is a soon as palette I
ever bought this palette doll I just
think it's perfect for anyone starting
out and they caught my iPhone it's so
useful when I was first starting out
because I really didn't need to buy
anything else once I have this and
because you can really create daytime
and nighttime look for those that shade
in the middle is bliss it's just like a
really beautiful sort of more V
transition color but it's not like too
cool if you want mean like it's not warm
around but it's not too cool at all
and then the other months like Sunstone
and ebony like these to the end the
darker shades are perfect in the outer V
and there is you really perfect like
setting your entire lid once you might
apply the paint part or a concealer and
then obviously all the shimmers you can
put anywhere on the lid or in the crease
and they just log insane the one shade
in particular kitten like see the
pigmentation of these is beautiful I
can't tell you like how they're just
stunning honest into the money they're
insane yeah I feel like Kissin is
definitely like my favorite one in the
palette just because you can see from
that it is blinded it's blending moving
on and then I also really love bubbly as
well bubbly
just like a shade darker or the
pigmentation
that's so creamy like so buttery it does
also come with an eye liner which is at
the bottom lines not in there anymore
but it's really good it's like a dark
brown I still have it and then you have
a mirror at the top as well so it's just
a really good like all-rounder okay next
is the one that's not particularly a
drugstore I feel like some people might
be pissy that I've included in it so
this is by multi and this is their 6500
as I said you obviously can't get it in
like boots or super dropper and if you
like that so it's technically not
drugstore you can get this on cost you
see a line I try finding any stores in
the UK stop this like install some or
crack me from wrong and but you can get
it on court you tease you today places
like that I usually go to court Beauty
we've all seen this a million bazillion
trillion dizzily little over times as
you can see it's just a big pile of warm
shadows which is what I love about it so
much and this one is actually cheaper
than the Stila one I want to say cuz I'm
pretty sure these are about 17 pounds
and obviously you get way more colors as
well I know some people get a bit sick
of like Beauty youtubers talking about
Mars because obviously there's so many
people that are like affiliated with
them and stuff but I'm not I've
mentioned to some real money and I use
it not every single day I would say but
there was a phase when I literally just
went for as I go to the shades as you
guys know as well like the Browns at the
top I love as well powders like I just
think that's far the only thing I would
say is they're not really well-made like
I don't know if you can tell but there's
one shadow here and that's also one here
that just popped out and fell out and I
have had this quite a while now and it's
been on many holidays with me so it's
kind of had its where the pigmentation
is really lovely the one thing I would
say about these shadows compares
Lauren's by like sealer and stuff the
maps can feel quite dry in in the sense
that when you're blending them they
sometimes just go a little bit patchy
because I feel like they're quite dry in
terms of the formula as your blend as
nice as all the shadows that I have are
if you do want something sort of
reliable for the money then I would 100%
recommend this or any of the palettes
that they do because I do have a couple
and I picked some all with my own money
and I think a fast especially again for
someone who's made to start now and just
want a palette that offers like a
and then at the very last pallet for
like the drugstore affordable ones which
is like my serum this is by NYX and this
is one of the ultimate basics palette
because I'm pretty sure we do about four
of these and I do have all four but the
one I love the most is this one which is
the shade warm neutrals so this is what
it looks like inside who started I love
the size of it like it's just a nice
little square kind of thick and it's
perfect for things like trouble and then
obviously again it's got like a lot of
shades in size to the size of it it also
is a really good range of mass and
shimmers as you can see you just get
like a really wide sort of variety of
colors in here all of them are warm
neutrals my voice Wow
reminds me a lot as the mat for
Mitchell's palette so if you've been one
in that where you don't have paid like I
think it's 50 pounds and I don't
actually know how much these are but I
will link them down below but again the
pigmentation is far been nice and creamy
and they blend like a dream I actually
find that these blends better than my
morphe Multi one history yet if I was
going to recommend any of the three I
would definitely say go with this one I
just think it's a good size it's perfect
for travel and it offers a wide range of
colors mattes and shimmers and they just
blend beautifully I love it so much and
then on to more high-end palettes these
are a little bit more expensive but I
would 100 centric amend them still and I
definitely think they're worth some
money
so the first one is by car in this
invest art late-- in bloom palette and
this is like the second Hartless palette
they brought out I believe I absolutely
love this palette comes with a big
mirror which again is perfect to travel
in and then it just got hello and then
it just got the eyeshadows down here and
again it's a neutral palette I feel like
pretty much all of these like none of
them are crazy colored palettes because
I feel like these are the sorts of
things I use more on a regular basis
again it's got a lovely range of mattes
and shimmers my favorite one in the
palette is rebel which is like the one
down here I just think it's like so
creamy and like pigmented like it's just
fast smells like vanilla as well it
smells so friggin good and the majority
do mmm you don't mind me pejorative gem
blend like a dream the only thing I
would say is the dark ones I have a
similar issue as the ones I have in the
morphe palette where they feel quite dry
so usually if I'm using the dark ones I
mix it a little bit of rebel on my brush
and then then go in with a darker one
it sort of helps to blend them together
I feel like if you just go straight in
with one of the darker ones like they
feel a little bit drier it's not like
crazy and which is compared to the other
ones are not as creamy I would say yeah
if you have the chance to buy this
because I do see people asking me
sometimes when they're making trips to
Sephora I would definitely recommend it
I love it I think it's our best reliable
and it's nice and steady and the
packaging is from the pretty you know so
pretty okay the second one is by
two-phase because if anyone knows me you
will know that I love Too Faced
eyeshadows I think that absolutely far
this is the chocolate bar palette
because out of all of the palettes that
I have buy two faces is probably the one
that I reach for the most and it just
looks like so so again it kind of like a
range like a range of neutrals and it's
got this really interesting like pop of
baby pink in the middle
I love this mostly for the smell it
smells so good it smells like chocolate
and again it's just got a lovely range
of one transition colors like deep
burgundy
it's got like a shimmery sort of khaki
green down here and also like the bright
source pete and myka metallic like -
metallics purple the shade up here
cherry cordial is like the deeper candy
that's my favorite ones it just looks so
pretty on blue green eyes I just think
it's up and I think if you've got the
money to spend on it and you want to
invest in something from tuesday's again
I love Too Faced mostly for their lip
products and that eye products because I
think they're melted master insane and
but this is my favorite palette buy them
and I would definitely recommend it or
like to spend the money on it or ask for
it as a present anything like that i
packaging - really cute as well the only
thing that annoys me is sometimes it
doesn't do it on this one but um some of
them don't shop very well at you don't
shop fully for their form fine and it's
nice and sturdy because it's like in a
muscle case and it looks like a
chocolate bar who wouldn't want that
with okay and then last but very not
least this is like my favorite palette
out of all of these ones I feel like
there's a lot of people who are probably
like shouting at the screen right now
because you know what I'm going to stay
but this is the modern releases when
it's on 24 moderate Rene font palette by
Anastasia Beverly Hills it just looks
like so it comes in a really cute little
pink felt packaging only thing that
annoys me about this is it gets dirty so
quickly but yeah I used open it up it's
got a mirror again and then it just come
with a makeup brush as well which I
can't say of every use
I don't know what it is like
palates come with brushes and like
applicators and stuff I just don't
bother using them because I feel like I
already have stuff that I like but this
palette is all I friggin use it's so bad
like I've got into the into a habit
where I literally just pick this off and
just use a summarize and then I'm good
to go like it's what I've gotten today I
think I don't really slow up with all
the palettes like as much now that I
have they're my favorite shade is red
ochre which is this one here and just
because I don't own any other eyeshadows
that are this much of like a true
classic deep red I don't really use the
shimmers in the palette is about five
eyes shadows that I usually use and
that's more Sienna burn orange which is
a to sort of I just of Manila and start
but the to sort of transition colors
down here and then I usually go to the
one at the end which I don't need not
say that it's like this sort of orange
challenge red yeah and then I go in with
red ochre which is this one here and
then I use Cyprus ombo which is the one
at the end might go really dark brown
and I have to say like I don't really
reach for any of the colors in the
palette it's usually those it's at five
yeah I've never really used love less
Knar or like the other pink shade just
occurred I love this for the Reds and
the warm Browns and that's pretty much
air and but I would 100 stand by this
palette all over again like 20 times
just to have those colors even though I
don't use feel this they blend like no
other eyeshadows I have my season makeup
geek and my favorite sort of formulas of
our eyeshadows because they just blend
like a dream I can't even explain
everything that I like about them and
you just have so much time to play with
him because I feel like with the multi
ones and the Tarte ones the minute you
put them on the eyes you really got a
start when you're now but with these you
can put them down and you've got so much
time to just blend them because they
just keep learning and they just sort of
blend into like a really seamless blend
you know you know but yeah if I was
going to get anything in this video it
was 100% be this one I obviously love
all the other ones equally but this is
the one I reach for the most and the one
I get the most use out of but yeah that
was pretty much it for this video I
really hope you all found this useful if
you're looking to invest in some
palettes you sell my drill is on fire
