welcome back today we are doing a whole
boys and girls it feels like such a long
time since I've started doing clothing
haul
I don't know when the lesson was I'm not
bought any clothes or shoes in so long
because I feel like my wardrobe is
actually overflowing it's a joke but me
and Kane I've got a few of mini like
trips and stuff coming up so I thought
I'd get some outfits about that and it's
coming into summer time so I feel like I
needed some know some fresh new things
I'm not got like tons of stuff to share
with you it's kind of gonna be a small I
feel like it's gonna be a small hole for
me anyway and I picked up a couple pairs
of shoes and some kind of like more
spring/summer appropriate outfits
because my wardrobe is literally just
jumpers and jeans so yeah I'm just gonna
get straight into it so the first thing
that I picked up a pair of trainers
these trip tips I told myself
many a year ago okay I told myself I
would never buy a pair of Nike Air Force
because I feel like they are the most
overdone trainer in the whole world they
are like a really pretty pair of
trainers but I was just like huh no
don't do it
everyone's got their I thought it might
as if everyone's got their but I just
felt like I was like no don't buy them
okay but the time has come I finally
caved and picked up a pair of Air Force
because you know what I like them and I
want a pair so this is what they look
like I feel like I don't you need to
show you because you've probably seen
them a million times but they're
literally just all white trainers and
they've got a bit of like a platform as
well so they've got like a thicker soul
I'm kind of just lacking a pair of white
trainers at the minute I basically spend
well I bought my easy switch all white
like 150 pounds I wore them for the
first time the other day and I got them
like so dirty it was ridiculous like
probably the dirtiest I've ever got a
pair of white trainers and now I'm too
scared to wear them because my knees are
like I just love them so much so I
thought I'd just get like a cheaper pair
of white trainers I guess I know these
aren't like super cheap as it is but
just something that I'll feel more
comfortable wearing and won't like worry
about as much and because they're
leather they'll hopefully be easier to
clean I'm pretty sure these are about 50
pounds because I'm a size like 4 to 5 so
I can get like the junior ones and not
the adult ones ya know I'm excited to
wear them they look so fresh and clean
I just white trainers I like a guilty
pleasure I love them so much but I got
so scared to wear and then I also picked
up a can of crap protect I always kept
my like Tong to see when I try and say
that crap protect feel this has been out
for so long and I just
like believe in it if you're not I mean
but I've seen a couple of videos online
and it does look really good it's
basically just like a shoe protectant so
it's supposed to kind of like protect
your shoes from dirt and if they do get
dirty it's supposedly like easier to
clean I dunno we'll see if anyone's use
this let me know what your thoughts are
so I picked up a couple of things from I
saw at first I actually only remember
buying these so that just goes to show
how reckless I am when it comes to
online shopping but I've not actually
tried the clothes on so I completely
forgot about them so I will show them
anyway but they've not got translate so
I hope that's okay okay so I'm not gonna
try these on but if anyone follows
Jordan Lipscomb my baby George she has
like the cutest pair of sandals from I
saw it first
and they I'm pretty sure they are like a
similar style to this so they're quite
like a thick wedge platform and then
they just kind of lace up with straps
I feel like hers are maybe black I'm not
entirely sure I don't think that this
exact pair but she wore them a lot last
summer one went to Ibiza and things like
that and I just love them like they look
so cute with so many different outfits
and they look super comfy because
obviously they're a really thick wedge
but they're kind of a little bit more
they've got a bit more going on than
just a flat sandal so these I just
picked up these are actually in the sale
so I don't know if there's any sizes
left I will leave links to everything
down below as always yeah these are in
the sale so I'm pretty sure they were
only like 20 pounds or so I want to say
so just pick them up for like spring
summer time hopefully I pulled them off
like Jordan Jordan pulls everything off
so well okay and I picked up one top and
for some reason I'm really into like
mustard at the minute I just think it's
such a pretty color I don't know if it's
Michael yet because I didn't actually
got something out some Topshop which
I'll show you in a man which is the same
color and I tried it on I don't know if
it's Michael I even though I loved it I
just don't know if it suits me this is
just a mustard like blouse it's
basically just a crutch blouse and its
highs up there so it's not got like a
front it just looks like one bit fabric
and but it just ties around your boobies
I guess also I've got little flood
sleeves which I have - a little bit
lemony I really love this style of like
sleeves on tops and dresses and stuff I
can't remember what just was I feel like
it was fairly cheap pretty much
everything from I saw it first is pretty
affordable and inexpensive Grayson this
one's gonna be a little bit more
difficult to show I'm really sorry that
I've not got Tryon clips for this job
this reminded me of something that I
actually wore last year
so at first so when we went to I beat
the with them last year I very kindly
gifted me like it was like a nude lace
cher jumpsuit situation I'll put a
picture in here and this is kind of a
similar vibe it's not exactly the same
because this is a dress and it's also
got shorts the user as the other one was
just like strappy but it's basically
just black kind of like mash I guess and
then it's got flowers all over it feel
like it's a little bit glam for daytime
but it kind of just reminded me of what
I wore in Ibiza last year and it made it
like a really nice evening outfit okay
I'm just up that I got from this guy did
you're gonna see that there's a bit of a
running theme here because I'm really
into like floral stuff at the minute I
don't know why I just feel like it's
that time of year where I just want
flowers everywhere oh this is basically
it's kind of like a similar vibe to what
I just showed from ISO Affairs except
this is a top so it's just a white share
round neck top and then again it's kind
of got like slightly wider sleeves not
really bell sleeves were just a little
bit wider than towards the top of the
sleeve and then it's got a white really
small waistband which you can kind of
pull in which was quite nice yeah it's
just share and it's got kind of like
flowers and little polka dots and stuff
on obviously you'd have to wear like a
bodysuit well you don't have to if you
don't want to I would probably pair this
with a buddy sue or a white brother or
something like that
I did actually pick up the bralette that
the model was wearing it weird and this
is so cute I mean it looks like really
skimpy which it is but yeah it's the
sort of thing that would just look
really pretty under like something it's
a little bit sheer and lacy I feel like
oh yeah I tried this on I don't know if
I like it yeah I can't decide I like the
vibe but I feel like it's quite big
fitted in a sense I don't know I can't
make my mind up on air okay and then I
also picked up a bodysuit because I had
my eye on this body suit for I feel like
it's been on the website for like a
couple of months pretty much the same
thing okay you put in a body suit it's
different types of flowers and things
and it's just like a sheer bodysuit so
again you'd probably have to you don't
know do you
you probably want to pair this with like
nipple covers or like a nude you could
put it like over a nude body suit or
something like that so it's quite big
fitted and yeah it's just got a white
back and then all the front is just kind
of shared with lacy flowers on again I
just thought it was so cute really
somewhat appropriate I thought this
would look cute with a pair of mom jeans
or high-waisted jeans always like
Hauser's something like that for a bit
more of an even outfit so it's a little
bit large fitted but it does have a just
strap so it's not the end of the world
next thing I picked up was a dress this
is probably one of my favorite things in
this whole yeah it's kind of just like a
light blue and then it's got kind of
like pink and green flowers all over it
the color is very frilly like the whole
thing in general has just got a lot of
frills on the go bottom as well super
affiliate but it just looks so pretty on
feels really comfortable on it fits
really well they have these in a bunch
of different colors and like styles so
you don't have to get this exact one if
it's not like the clothes and stuff on
your cup of tea but I just thought it
was really cute and something a bit
different it's like daytime in summer
okay next piece again it's floral yes
I'm not convinced on I absolutely love
the style of it like I probably prefer
the style of this to the blue one I love
both I just love this one so much but
the fit is just like not quite right
which is so disappointing because I
absolutely love it so it's basically
just a mini dress and so it's just got
red flowers all over it just like a
black mini dress quite sure not too
short though I'm 5 foot 7 it's not too
short on me some things from misguided
can be like up my arse sometimes I don't
know if you can see but the like boob
section the Prahalad section basically
has underwire so they're kind of like
cops in a sense I feel like they're just
made for a certain size boob that it's
not my boob I'm a c-cup if any wants to
know like I don't mind telling people
that so I feel like if you are a c-cup
or smaller I'm struggling like I tried
this on and I struggle to fill it so
it's just something to bear in mind if
you are interested in getting this
doesn't look crazy on camera but it's
the sort of thing that when you start
like walking around and moving this job
it just slips lower low and low her
sleeves are really cute again I feel
like they could be a tiny bit tighter
which is kind of strange because usually
on misguided I find that stuff can be a
little bit too tight in the arms I think
just in general the whole like a
proportion of the dress is a little bit
bigger fitted than the lower portion but
ya know I dunno I might try and adjust
it or try it on with a bra or something
like that see how I can maybe make it
work because I do love it and then this
I absolutely love this is like the
comfiest coziest thing I've ever seen in
my life
they've got a couple of jumpers in this
style
the website of the minute so I think
this one is out with Slotkin Alex I'm
pretty sure I snagged the last 10 I'll
link similar things down below if you're
interested in it it's basically just a
really big oversized jump up it's so
soft inside it's like fleece material
inside it's so cozy I'm absolutely
obsessed with there it's just a cute
little thing you know it's a cute little
thing to have okay and then last but not
least I am so in love with this this is
the first thing that I tried on when I
was doing the tram clips and I honestly
did not want to take it off it's so
comfy so it's basically just a cropped
fluffy hoodie and the reason I bought
this it's gonna sound so silly but my
house like our house just always feels
so cold and like I feel the cold I'm one
of those people where I get so cold so
quickly so I wanted to pick up a jumper
that's like really soft really cozy
basically just this just to wear around
the house and keep me warm and stuff
like that I mean you could wear this out
if you wanted to I probably will where I
bought it mostly just to kind of wear on
the house and stuff like that the
qualities that really nice it's actually
it's not like thin in the sense that
it's not thick enough to keep you on but
it's not like overbearing if you know I
mean it's not like a really heavy jumper
obviously it's loose fitted anyway but I
kind of like that it's just like buggy
and slouchy and stretchy I'm obsessed
with this I wish you could feel how soft
this is because it's unreal okay moving
on to Topshop this is the last stuff
that I picked up and it's pretty much
all the same but different no I'll show
you the first thing looks like separates
all the rest of the staff this is the
top that was speaking about before when
I showed the other mustard it's hot that
I got from I so at first so it's
basically just a little crop top it says
no hard feelings in white text on the
front I thin it's thinner than I
expected it to be it was a 14 pounds
which is pretty pretty affordable I
guess for a crop top just got a little
cuffed like rolled sleeves as well which
is really cute feels really comfortable
on you starting to fix my color I don't
know I'm gonna have to like try it on
probably because when I tried it on I
didn't have my makeup on on my head or
not anything like that I'm gonna have to
style it properly and see how it goes I
just saw it on the website and I thought
it was super cute so I picked that off
and then everything else that I got from
Topshop it's gonna sound ridiculous but
every single other product is a pinafore
though I don't know if any of you watch
my um
lookbook that I filmed I think I've
loaded it in January so the first outfit
that I had in that was a pinafore and
like a roll neck tops
like I love that outfit that was my
favorite outfit in that lookbook which
is why it was at the star and it was
just something that I've never really
worn or got into but after that one that
I've had now like I just loved them and
I just wanted to pick up mom no I bought
four okay which I know is so excessive
if this one is from top shelf as well
which is why I got them all from here
and the reason I bought four is because
I just kind of knew in my head that not
all of them would look right if that
makes sense and because I was buying
them online I just wanted to pick up a
bunch and try them on and kind of send
the ones back that I didn't like so the
first one it's kind of a different
material it's more of like a suede e
material and it's kind of like just a
dusty pink it's not I do really like I
like the little bit different in the
sense that it's not a typical denim
color probably just palace with like a
similar top to what I wore with the
other one that I've got just like a
white ribbed Rolnick t-shirt yeah I know
how much was this this one was at 39
pounds some of them are like I mean
Topshop can be pretty expensive in my
opinion if you like if you bought a
pinafore from misguided or pretty little
thing or something it'd be a lot more
affordable I do like the fit of this I'm
not sure if I'm like obsessed with it on
me I'm gonna have a go at styling it and
stuff and see how it goes and if I like
it I'll keep it and if I don't go back
this one I have such high hopes for
because it's kind of a similar vibe to
the other one that I have in the sense
that it's like check what do you call
this pattern I don't know yeah it's
basically a similar style but it's gray
so it's just a different color I had so
like such high hopes it is but the
straps are just so long I mean you'll
see in the Tryon clip that they just
they just back on my shoulders like
they're way too big there's no way to
adjust them either that's that she's
just like that they call and you just
have to deal with that I mean you could
probably adjust them if you wanted to
but I feel like it's just not worth it
you may still just get a different one
it's almost 29 pounds which is still
pretty expensive and I feel like the
Topshop like you should have adjustable
straps on there because they're not
exactly a one-size-fits-all thing do you
know what I mean it's just a shame
because I do actually really like the
pattern and the color and stuff like
that and I feel like it would have made
a really nice outfit if it actually fit
okay the last two are both denim so this
is the first one again I don't know if I
like this one on me I feel like the
denim might be too dark for me
I don't know so this one was a 36 pounds
so a little bit more expensive again
this one does have adjustable straps
which thank God it's literally just a
basic blue denim color
it's got the same pockets on the front
and stuff like that it's like I do like
what I don't know if I like it enough to
keep it yeah ad now again I feel like I
need to style it properly and just
pattern out actually make an effort were
there okay and then this one this is my
favorite one so I've saved the best for
last it is like more of a lighter wash
down in which I feel like suits me hello
the book did you get what was I saying
well hard is when yeah so it's a lighter
wash denim and it's got flowers all over
it again it's like a floral vibe I don't
know what's happened to me because I'm
not the sort of person to usually wear
floral stuff but I don't know it's just
something about it the minute that I
love but it's the exactly same style so
it's got the pocket unlike the straps
and stuff like that the only thing is I
had to get this in an a I would usually
get them in a 10 and I had to get this
one in an 8 it was sold out in a time I
don't know if it's like a little bit too
tight for me I can't decide I feel like
in some senses it fits better because
it's more fitted to my body but in other
senses it is a little bit tight on my
hips so I don't know this is probably my
favorite one and the one that I'm most
likely to keep out of all of this so
yeah that was pretty much everything
that I've picked up recently it
clothing-wise for some reason I feel
like this whole just felt so different
to what I would usually film I don't
know why maybe it's just because I'm not
you know I feel like I'm not gonna sit
down at a video and so long like I've
done so many makeup videos recently I
just feel really different today I'm
gonna get going anyway so thank you it's
so much watching I love you guys Samir
about a million times over as always and
I'll see you in the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
