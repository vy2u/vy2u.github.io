Sunday today boys and girls we're going
to be doing another clothing video which
I know I know what you think in Hana you
have way too many clothes by now I
already know it's a problem I don't know
what's going on at the manera I'm just
like feeling clothing and fashion like
I'm obsessed I'm actually going to
parish this weekend so hopefully a lot
of this stuff I'm gonna take with me
which is super exciting I cannot wait
for ya I'm super excited this video is
also in collaboration with 21 buttons
which you guys know I love 21 buttons
it's so much I've had a profile on there
for quite a few months now so if you not
follow me already I'm gonna leave a link
down below okay those of you don't know
what 21 buttons is it's basically an app
that's kind of based around fashion so
it's really helpful for getting outfit
inspiration and things like that
super handy as well because you can
basically sharp outfits and like items
and stuff directly through the app so
say if you come across a photo where you
really love what someone is wearing
there'll be different buttons on the
photo of the outfit and that will take
you straight to the pieces on the actual
website whether from so you don't
necessarily have to set up a profile to
post your own photos you can kind of use
it to just get inspiration and like
outfit inspo from other people if you do
want to be posting your own images one
thing that I absolutely love about the
app which is super cool is you actually
get commission on anything that someone
else purchases through your buttons if
that makes sense so basically every
single time someone purchases an item
through your profile and through one of
your buttons you actually end commission
on that piece as well and that's not
just that influences either like anyone
can make Commission on the app and make
money which is super cool so I follow
about 30 people and this is what my home
page looks like so as you scroll through
the feed you can just see different
profiles through different photos and
different buttons of what people have
linked of what they're wearing and then
if we go to my low profile though I have
been using this for a couple of months
now which is why there's a good few
outfits on there because it's just
basically stuff that I've been wearing
it through the months so this is a photo
that I took recently I basically linked
the body suit which was from misguided
and then also the jeans that were from
fashion Nova and as you can see a couple
of people well at least 56 and 53 saves
on each one which is basically people
who have saved it who maybe alike
interested in it but didn't want to buy
it so I've just saved it to their
profile the app itself as well is so
easy to use and so
shot through so say for example have we
gone this photo which I took in Finland
with the local ski I linked the beanie
heart so you literally just click the
button like so and then you click visit
website as you can see it's a beanie
from a sauce and it literally takes you
straight to the website where you can
just add it to your bag and then when
you go to the checkout it's there and
it's ready to check out a lot of the
time as well there are photos and
certain outfits on the app that you
won't necessarily find on other apps
which is really cool so it's a really
good place to be if you are someone who
is a fashion lover I'm gonna leave a
link to my profile down below I'm
actually doing a giveaway as well which
I'm super excited about so I'm gonna be
giving away a 100 pound a sauce out jar
because some of the stuff that I got for
this haul is from Acer so I thought it'd
be really cool to give one away in case
you want to take up anything that I
picked up or if there's anything you've
got your eye on in general all you need
to do to enter is just follow me on 21
buttons so I will leave a link down
below in the description bar and then
you literally just need to click the
competition banner on my profile and
that will answer you to win the gift
card only gonna be live for a week okay
once this videos live so make sure you
get in trim because who doesn't want a
hundred pounds on excel anyway I'm gonna
get straight into it now I'm going to
stage that here one because my car is
like here on the bed and she just is
refusing to move and to because there
will be some Tryon Clips that I'll put
on the screen here anyway so first thing
I picked up were a pair of heels so I
basically got these in black and then
this kind of like maka brown color which
I'm obsessed with I've never had a pair
of brown heels but I'm loving them so
these are actually from the wide fit
collection from Asus because if anyone
doesn't know okay I have wide feet
they're like little rectangles on the
end of my legs and I always struggle
with heels like heels is one thing I
just took away so much because I feel
like people just or Brunn's sorry always
just make them really skinny down here
ASIS have pretty much brought out a like
a wide fit range so they've got this
color it's basically just a basic heel
it's just kind of like a simple one
strap here one strap at the top with a
little buckle and then it's just got a
skinny heel and a really small platform
which I quite like because I don't like
anything too thin it just kills my feet
well they fit perfectly so if anyone is
after some white fit heels the one thing
that I love about a sauce is the fact
that you can shop shoes as like wide fit
if that me
sense but yeah I'm obsessed with these
so I just got a brown color and a black
color absolutely love them if anyone
else struggles with like wide fit shoe
issues I definitely recommend it
shopping on a sauce because they've got
a full range of all the wide fit shoe
shares okay next from a sauce I picked
up a dress this is gonna be really hard
I just dropped a ring and I can't be us
making it loves though this is gonna be
a lot bit tricky to show just because
it's basically got little wrap overs and
layers and stuff like that but it's
pretty much just a mini dress I just
fell in love with this from like the
colors on it so it's basically just
white and then it's got all different
colored flowers all over it so it's got
sunflowers rose obviously I'm not very
good at flowers so I don't know what
kind of flowers the rest of them are but
there's just blue flowers red flowers
yellow flowers all over which I just
thought was so cute one thing I don't
like is the actual like wrap over so it
has like a wrap over that you're
supposed to do up at the front but I did
it up at the front and it just looked
really strange so I kind of it broke the
rules a little bit okay I did it off at
the back instead and I feel like that
just looked way better I got this in an
a it fits pretty well in my opinion and
doesn't have a lot of shape to it so if
you're the sort of person that doesn't
like flowy things and you probably won't
like this next thing I picked up from a
sauce and this is from a brand called
the rugged priest which I've never heard
before but I came across his top and I
thought it was so cute so it's just a
little turtleneck and it's got navy and
black stripes all over it have to say
there's gonna be a lot of Navy in this
haul because for some reason I'm just
obsessed with like Navy clothes at the
minute I don't know I just think they're
really cute but yeah it's just got a lot
of stripes all over it and then it says
gnarly in yellow text on the front which
i think is super cool it's like a really
cool pop of color the sleeves are like
bell sleeves a little bit as well so
they don't but they do go a little bit
wider at the ends and it is a little bit
cropped which is nice it's like quite a
nice length I do really like this I feel
like it'll look cute with a pair of
jeans or a pair of shorts maybe in
summer in my head I've just got like mom
jeans and a pair of trainers I feel like
this would look pretty cute and then I
also picked up a little top so again
this is just a t-shirt it's just a plain
white t-shirt and in red text it says
thanks for nothing in which again it
just thought was really cute just like a
basic t-shirt to pair with jeans or
shorts or whatever elves so I got this
in an a and it's kind of fitted at true
to size I would say like it's not super
tight and it's not super buggy but just
like a cute little basic top you know
you know okay moving it aren't a pretty
little thing I thought I've got more
stuff I think besides just about mostly
jewelry so I got this as jewel jewel
jewelry here and pretty little thing I
just got some little necklaces and stuff
like that but I can only find one top
that I got so this is just a black
ruched top I still don't know if I say
that right but I'm just gonna go with it
so it's just a little black crop top
just long sleeve and then it's basically
a Bardot situation so it sits off the
shoulders this I got in a size a I love
this
okay I'm absolutely obsessive there I'm
feeling like I'm gonna want to get more
colors of this because it's such like a
cute basic top but at the same time it
looks like it looks like it could be
quite dressy with a pair of white like
trousers or you could wear it for
daytime with jeans and then I did get a
couple of pieces of jewelry so I'm
actually wearing one of them it's this
kind of necklace here which I don't know
if you're going to be able to see
properly it's basically just a choker
and then it comes down into like more of
a longer necklace as well which is why I
kind of paired it with this top I feel
like it paired with something kind of
v-neck quite well and then I'm
absolutely good because I got the cute
it's necklace from pretty little thing
that says Leo on it because my style
sign is a Leo and I was so in the way
I'm absolutely there and I've lost it
like I cannot find it anywhere this is
an issue with me and jewelry like this
is why I don't usually bother because
anything that's dainty or a little bit
small like it just goes missing okay I
just lose it straight away so I picked
up a new one
this says mermaid funny which I thought
would be really cute summertime you know
when you've got your bikini on on the
beach and stuff like that just think is
that the same style so it's just gold
and text like writing on it which is
exactly what my leo one was which I'm
genuinely so good at that I've lost it
like I can't find it anywhere
yeah this is gonna have to make do for
now because I love the style of it like
I love the text I feel like it looked
really pretty on and it's nice and
dainty as well and I got it in gold
because gold just I think at the minute
I used to wear silver jewelry all the
time but now I'm just loving gold these
rings as well I'm wearing well also from
a Czar's I don't really want to show you
too close up because my nails are
share and getting them done this weekend
and I'm so excited but I got like more
of a chunky ring from a sauce I'll show
you a little bit so that is what those
ones look like from a sauce the two kind
of dainty ones the one on my little
finger on my fourth finger they claim as
like a pack which is super cute I got
them in like a small medium so it fits
my pinky quite well and then it fits
like the tops above my knuckles quite
well it's not your knuckles what are
they I don't know your joints okay
moving on to stuff that I got from
misguided I know this holes a bit all
over the place I usually do holes these
days which is like all one brand but I
kind of just like went on loads of
different retailers and family the
different things the first thing I
picked up is a two-piece and it's Navy
because as I was saying I'm just loving
Navy at the minute I just feel like I
love all black but I've kind of done out
like I've outdone all black so this is
from the collie Bible collection this is
the lower part the 2p so it's basically
just kind of like slinky material
leggings and then the top is the exact
same material but a banjo so I got this
in a size a these leggings a really good
quality like I was super impressed one
thing that I love about them as well
which you might not be able to tell
where you can kind of tell actually just
from holding it the actual length from
the crotch to the top of the leggings is
so long which I love because it means
you can wear them super high-waisted I
wish everyone made leggings like this
okay because for example I love Oh poly
ligands like the double layered but I
just feel like they always slip down on
my hips and stuff which I just don't
want and then the actual bun dough is
like a cropped navy
band oh pretty cropped like it's quite
small but it kind of works because the
actual leggings are so high-waisted that
there isn't too much I'm sure you know I
mean again really thick I put this on
without a bra
and you could probably see like a little
bit of nipple through it but it wasn't
anything crazy like it felt really comfy
and really good quality hey onto this
has not been redone art so it's like one
big fit fabric this I am absolutely
obsessed with so this is from the
collaboration with funny little men is
that how you say I'm not entirely sure
I'm really sorry if I butchered that her
collection was so cool a lot of it sold
out really fast I was a bit like I wish
I could have picked up more stuff
because a lot of it looked really cool
but this was still in stock and when I
feels dr. air I was like that is not
going to be super flattering on my
I just didn't think it would suit me
when it's calm and I tried it on I'm
absolutely in love with it though I got
a size 8 again absolutely love the fit
of it so it's basically just a black
kind of crocodile effect bra layer so
it's a pretty deep plunge which is what
I was worried about because stuff that's
like really deep kind of like v-neck
plunge it doesn't use it doesn't usually
suit me
this looks pretty flattering like I feel
like this gave me a nice bit of cleavage
which I don't usually have okay I don't
usually live the cleavage life so I
really like this a lot and it feels
really good quality again feels just
really secure I don't know if that makes
sense but whenever I put relics on like
I want them to feel secure you know
because you just protecting my boobies
so maybe an arm - two jumpsuits I picked
up so these are kind of like the utility
style
jangsu kind of quite buggy it got like
pockets on the leg and that kind of vibe
so they're very yeah they're very buggy
and kind of like a silk material this is
the Navy one so it's just got a collar
and then it just has a gold dip that
goes all the way up the middle and then
it just have a waistband that's highs as
well it's kind of gonna be difficult to
show but you'll see in a try own clip
I'm going to shuffle up so I can put it
in here I love this so it's got elastic
a edge bottoms like on the bottom of the
legs which you can kind of pull up
depending like how far up your calf you
want them which is pretty cool this just
looks really cool on the model like I
love the way it was styled I feel like
it looks so good with like a pair of
heels and like I slit that pony kind of
vibe really soft material and thin
material but not too thin if that makes
sense so it doesn't it feel like cheap
on and it doesn't feel like see-through
or too thin or anything like that it's
just kind of like a nice comfy material
but the whole vibe of it I just really
loved and honestly there's nothing I
love more than a good jumpsuit because
you just put it on and your outfits dawn
like you don't have to think about
anything else other than your shoes you
know I mean and then I did actually got
leaves that same product the exact same
piece in kind of more of them more the
pinky color because I'm a sort of person
where if I see something that I like and
it's in a hospital is like I just have
to pick up all the colors so this is the
pinky
sort of more v1 and it's just got again
the pockets on the chest and stuff like
that you see exact same piece just in a
different color miss me Oh bless me
sorry Baba just check my lashes still
yeah
again I picked up something that is the
exact same product to put into you at
different colors there's kind of like
utility cargo pan
vibe is just so in style at the minute
and I'm absolutely loving it okay first
of all I'm pretty sure I got both in an
eight because I remember ordering both
pattern than a unless I'm purposely
bought a time but either way a 10 in the
Navy turned up which I was going about
because I kind of explained these are
the biggest size 10 I've ever seen in my
life I'm like an 8 to 10 so I kind of
wear size 10 choices a lot of the time
these was so big for a size 10 like I
don't know what was going on and I'd
have actually ordered the size 6 in
these hoping that they're gonna fit but
the ones in an a it fit pretty well so I
don't know we're gonna have to see I've
not even showed you the actual charles's
they basically just again got like
elasticated bottoms around the ankles
and then they've got pockets on the side
as well which I really love and then the
white pair I just need exact seen but
white so they're just white with black
stitching all over which I really like
I've wanted like a nice pair of white
sort of utility jogger charles's
situation for a while so I'm hoping I'm
gonna be able to alleys and they'll look
okay on is that everything though I feel
like that was way smaller than I thought
it was gonna be and I put myself into a
tangle yeah that was pretty much
everything that I picked up for this
haul for some reason I thought I have
more stuff to show I thought I feel like
I bought most often it's just I don't
know I don't know where it's gone so I
hope you enjoyed this like I said in the
beginning and make sure you follow me on
21 buttons if you want to be in with the
chance of winning a 100-pound ASOS card
and you just want some fashion in so in
general if you like white wow yeah I'm
gonna get going anyway so thank you so
much for watching I love you guys soon
and back a million times over and I'll
see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
