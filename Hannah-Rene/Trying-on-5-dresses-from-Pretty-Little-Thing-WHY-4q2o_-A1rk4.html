like it's been a really long time since
I sat down and filmed I don't know why
but it just feels like a long time so
hello I hope you're all well and having
a lovely week as always today we're
gonna be doing another clothing video
which I feel like I'm just on a roll
with like clothing videos at the minute
like I'm just really enjoying filming
them so I hope you don't mind I hope you
all enjoyed them my cats just like
 about in background so don't why
not
so last week I did my testing low-rated
mascara clothes which you all seem to
really enjoy let me know if you want a
part too and thank you so much for all
of the love on that video I really
appreciate it as always and I saw a
couple of people commenting asking for
me to do the not only a challenge but
basically asking for me to try on five
pound dresses from pretty little things
so I bought 10 dresses from the 5 pound
dress range and honestly like I've
already tried them all on I do really
want to start doing these videos where I
actually tried them on and film like
wasum trying them on rather than just
doing try on clips but honestly my room
is just not big enough for that right
now so when I've like moved into my
office I'm gonna start doing that
because I know some people prefer it
that way I'm gonna start off with the
good ones okay so in case any of you
have come here hoping it's actually find
a good dress for bypass these are the
ones that I do actually kind of like so
the first one is a skater dress which I
wanted to make sure that I got a range
of dress styles and also colors so that
we could kind of like see the full gist
of the rain this one it like I said it's
a skater dress it's just a white plain
skater dress pretty much all of them are
just basic pieces which I quite like
like I don't like a lot of pattern or a
lot of color like I'm white I'm quite a
basic person okay this I do really like
and I feel like the five pounds it's not
too bad so the actual top part of the
dress is what kind of sells it for me in
a sense and what kind of works really
well because the actual bralette section
like what colors a little boobies on you
big boobies you know who knows this is
actually double layers so you're not
you're probably not gonna be able to
tell on camera but it is actually pretty
thick so I put this on without a bra
because I don't usually wear a bra with
dresses unless I really need to and I
feel like I'm pretty sure you can't
really see any nipple you could maybe
see a tiny tiny bit but nothing like
super crazy actual lower part of the
dress is a tiny bit more disappointing
because it is just one layer and
because it's why it is pretty
see-through and so if you like with nude
underwear it could work quite well and
for five pounds it's it's pretty damn
good in my opinion like it's pretty good
and then this one okay I like this one
but I feel like I kind of cheated with
this one a bit because it's not it was
actually reduced to five pounds so
originally it was twelve pounds but now
it is five pounds so it kind of it's a
500-foot wasn't originally if I plunge
ass just called the PLT print bodycon
dress which is basically what it is
really like the color of the camel like
it's not too warm to the point where it
doesn't suit me because I feel like
stuff that's a little bit too warm on my
skintone for some reason it doesn't look
quite right I like the print looks quite
q the actual length is really nice as
well because length is an issue that I
had with some of the other dresses I'm
gonna go through I don't know if it's
still in stock because it was in the
sale but as always I will leave it links
everything down below so that one again
I did light okay this one wasn't too bad
let me do this one next because I didn't
love it but it wasn't as bad as some
other other ones were so it's a bit more
of a plunge and I will say it's quite a
deep punch so when I put it on it was
alright but as I started walking around
it did seem to kind of get lower on my
chest area and it was a little bit
see-through a little bit thin it's a bit
of a rib material it's not like that bad
because I feel like with the right
underwear you could probably get away
with this if you like a deep plunge it
just is a little bit on the thin side
which is the issue a lot of these
dresses like they're just not the best
quality oh this one I didn't actually
mind either
so I feel like I tried on all the worst
ones first the ones that I just did not
like whatsoever so it's just left a bad
taste in my mouth
so this one is a black mini dress again
again it's just body con pretty much all
of these are body con apart and like to
skate a dress this has basically a
detail on the side of one of the legs
that has massive cutouts so it's very
kind of like exposing on the thigh and
the like region so it's obviously could
Charlie shut that door any harder
honestly yeah it's up to you how much
you mind having you like any size and
your booty on show I could have wear any
underwear with this for that reason so
it's just something to bear in mind you
could probably maybe wear like a nude
thumb if you wanted to but I feel like
if you want it to look the best it can
look then you can't really wear any
under
it fit pretty well again everything I
got was in the size a it was pretty sure
it's what I will say I'm five foot seven
like I said so anyone who's like my
height or taller these dresses unless
you got a midi dress they're just not
made for our length not even that I'm
that slow like five foot seven isn't
even like that tall but the link was
just not in my favor it's not this you
know I mean it's not the worst thing in
the world but it probably will have to
go back ok which one is this oh my god
okay this dress I've just realized which
one it is okay this was the first one I
tried on I had no hope after trying on
this dress I honestly thought this video
was just gonna be an absolute disaster
so this is a mini dress again it's just
a blood ripped material quite a lot of
stuff is either like just black a kind
of like thin crappy material or ripped
material again it's just like a little
oh no it's not sorry it's a t-shirt kind
of situation the top of the dress I
actually really like because I feel like
bodycon dress is that kind of a t-shirt
at the top would look really cool with a
pair of trainers or something for
daytime so the issue with this okay so
it fit perfectly at the top fit really
well it wasn't too thin because it's
black again it wasn't see-through or
anything like that
there's slit though this slit okay I
feel like I've experienced some slits in
my life on dresses not until I came
across this this is the most extreme
slit ever a genuine had slit cover
myself okay because I was just there was
that much of me out and about this was
just not a cute moment for me um I don't
really understand why the slit is so
deep or why it just exposes so much I
feel like this would have been such a
good dress if the slit was just a little
bit less because the the rest of it's
fine like the rest of it I actually
really do like but it's just that one
thing there's always that one thing that
just does not work out I don't know and
then it else got this one because for me
the slit was just like exposing the
whole of my favorite another one that is
just not very wearable at all this is a
white band oh just like long bodycon
long dress I mean I feel like you can
already tell before I even try and
explain this
how see-through this actually is this is
the issue with why like I love wearing
white clothes but so like especially
from pretty little thing and misguided
no shade at all because I absolutely
love both brands but because things are
a little bit more affordable and
obviously not like absolute quality as
other stuff that's why like a lot of the
time it is just see-through which is
just so disappointing I don't get it
okay I had to cover my boobs for
starters because you could just see
everything every part of nipple there
was to see terms of the lower part like
I had great Calvin Klein's on and yeah
you could just feel you could see oh I
just can't see anyone wearing this and
making it work to be quite honest that's
just my perfect okay this this little
guy
I actually really like again it's like I
feel like with all these dresses I like
though and then there's one thing that
just ruins there it's got it cut out in
the middle of like the belly section oh
it's just again a black roped a dress
just a mini dress and it just cuts out
so you actually get a little bit of
underboob which is quite cute because I
never really have underboob cleavage
side boob any of that stuff I feel like
my boobs are just not made for that life
it's kind of cute that you got a little
bit under booby obviously can pull it
down if you don't like that and then the
actual lower part of the cut is really
nice as well because it's not it's not
like too big of a cutout where you feel
like there's a lot of skin on show
unless you're gonna have the under boob
life a thing that lets this down is the
length oh my good gracious me okay the
length of this is ridiculous it's just
so annoying because surely you just make
the stuff a little bit too long than too
short because people could just take it
up or just like stitch you up a little
bit they wanted to I don't know we've
got again a white-wine that was just
really if I can see from so all of the
white Owens I mean I kind of knew when I
ordered them but I just wanted to order
them just in case we came across like a
gem that was really good I suppose the
white skate alms alright but any of the
white bodycon ones
I just um no so this is an a again as I
said and again love the style of this so
it's basically just a ribbed
there's like a lot of road stuff in this
as I said so it's just a ribbed bodycon
dress and it's basically just got a
little
kind of what do you even call this
second mini plunge it's like a mini
plunge on the chest region and then it's
just got Bardot straps which are really
cute yeah again just really see through
because it's white and thinner I mean I
kind of get it because if it's five
pounds like you get what you pay for in
a sense but I would just rather spend a
little bit more on something and
actually have something wearable if that
made sense it's like I don't see the
point in making these dresses in white
if they're just gonna be completely
see-through like how do people make
these work do people actually wear these
and get them to work because I need to
know if people come meet and wear the
black ones
fair enough for five pounds they're
pretty good it's just the length that's
an issue but they can obviously work for
people who are a little bit shorter
the white ones though I'm just like why
what's the point in making them if
they're just gonna be see-through do you
know I mean I was hoping for more you
know from this like I was just hoping
that I was gonna come across a little
stuff that I really liked and it's a
shame because I do actually really like
the style of a lot of this stuff it's
just the quality is not there but then
it's like four five pounds what do you
expect and what are you expecting so
yeah take from this what you will
obviously I still absolutely love a
pretty little thing and I appreciate the
fact that they've come out with this
range and tried to do something
affordable and stuff because I mean some
of them are okay just the majority of
them for me I'm not okay but if anyone
else has purchased any of these and they
work for you then I'm very jealous
because you know you've got a good dress
for a bargain but yeah I hope you all
enjoyed this let me know what you think
in the comments down below let me know
if you tried any of these and what
videos you want to see next do you want
