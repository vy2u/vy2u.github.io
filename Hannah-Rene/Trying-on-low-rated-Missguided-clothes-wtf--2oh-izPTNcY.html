you haven't Olivia weakened today we're
going to be doing a bit of a different
video okay
when I did my testing low rated coke
beauty makeup situation at last week I
was up reading through the comments and
I saw that one of you guys suggested to
do a similar sort of video but with a
clothing brand like misguided which is
what we're gonna do today I love a bit
misguided you guys know I love shopping
on misguided and I also love the fact
that they have reviews now because it
just gives you a better insight into
what you're purchasing so it's pretty
helpful that they have reviews now I
appreciate that okay I need to put a
little thing in a sauce to do the same
thing actually took me a long time to
put everything in the basket
order it because you can't order you
can't like filter things in terms of the
review so I basically just have to sit
there and just go through every single
product and click on it and basically
hope not live ever hope this in my life
but hope that I had a lo review I have
tried everything on already just so that
I kind of have like an opinion on it and
I can tell you my thoughts on it
compared to what the review is okay so
first things first we've got a denim
scare I was actually really excited
about this because I love the color I
love the sort of print on it just love
the whole vibe and I love a good denim
skirt especially when it gets into like
spring summer time though the lady who
reviewed it got a size 8 which is what I
also got because I usually am a size 8
she said it the waist came up really
large around the 1012 and the bottom hem
was too tight it felt like the skirt was
upside down it was really interesting
because I've not actually read these
reviews since I bought it so I couldn't
remember when I was trying it on what
people said what she said was spot-on
okay it was just it felt like it was
upside down it was way too tight on the
hips and the waist was just gaping on me
like I tried to show you a little bit in
a try on clothes so that you can see
what I mean this is such a shame because
I do really like here I love the color
like I said I just loved the whole vibe
of it the length of it was quite nice as
well it wasn't too too sure how much was
this as well this wasn't cheap so this
is the premium printed denim skirt it
was 32 pounds I suppose if you wanted to
wear it on your hips and not on the
waist as much then it could kind of work
but I do like my stuff like my jeans and
my skirts and stuff to be high-waisted
okay next thing we've got is a brawler I
love a good brawler oh this has actually
gone up in reviews since I've boy so
this is that three stars now I'm pretty
sure it was up to maybe what
I got this in 1/8 it's just white lace
all over and then the actual boob
section is a little bit more covered
it's got a bit more fabric to kind of
cover the nips you know how it is
it's interested because one of the
reviews basically says if you're an a
order a 14 at the sizes are pathetic not
everybody is a size zero which is a
little bit savage I actually found the
opposite with this I found that this was
a little bit large fitted so I've got
this in an 8 oh no I didn't I got it in
a 10 maybe that's why that oh is that
cuz it's sold out tonight yeah sold out
a new me okay I got a 10 because it sold
out in an 8 that makes sense now because
when I was trying it on I thought I've
got an 8 and it felt quite big and I'm
only a c-cup anyway okay I've not got
much to fill things with but the actual
style of it is really really pretty
it's only 18 pounds I think which for a
nice brawler is not too expensive I
really like the fact that it's got
adjustable straps like I said because
even though it is a little bit bigger I
mean it feels a little bit bigger on the
chest you can kind of adjust the strap
to make up for that and it feels tight
oh I do really like this I like this a
lot
I feel like it looked really cute with
for example that denim skirt if that's
go ahead fit it or maybe like a pair of
jeans or something like that yeah I'd
recommend this okay moving on something
I really didn't enjoy let me just find
the review for this bad boy so this was
actually in the sale this was reduced to
three pounds which I was kind of rooting
for it just for the fact that it was
three pounds because I wanted to I
wanted it to be good you know I mean oh
it's it's been put up to four pound AC
this is a bodysuit so it's literally
just a basic white strappy bodysuit kind
of just like a triangle
v-neck neckline situation so there's
kind of a range of bad reviews for this
a couple of people were saying it was
see-through and the white one seems to
be noticeably bigger the straps are too
long someone's had a hole in it luckily
mine didn't have any holes in it and
very low core especially for the fact
that it's not got adjustable straps
either this is why I'd bang on and on
and on about tummies and body suits and
braless and stuff anything that just has
thin straps I I just need stuff to have
adjustable strap because if it did you'd
be able to make it tighter and it
wouldn't feel as low caught so that
would
at least like one of the problems also
is super see true I put a nipple covers
on underneath because I needed nipple
covers for something else I bought
anyway they really cute little flower
ones that I actually got from misguided
as well you could just see the flower
nipple covers straight through this
there was just no high denier but it's
just a shame because I do love a good
white bodysuit but this one is just you
just kind of get what you pay for
okay so moving on what I actually did
need nipple covers for because you could
just see my nips straight through this
this is probably the worst reviewed
product out of everything it's got for
for onestart reviews so it's basically
just a sequin sort of halter neck
bralette situation and it's honestly
quite hard to show like just by holes in
it might have a cute idea I mean it was
expensive it was 30 pounds I think so
three of the reviews basically said that
it arrived broken so that is pretty much
the majority of like the low reviews
said that there's arrived broken mine
luckily it did not they came in one
piece so all of it is together but a lot
of people said it's quite heavy as well
which I will agree is heavy but in a way
I like the fact that it's heavy because
it feels a little bit more luxurious it
kind of feels more worth 30 pounds you
know I mean feel like this would be
really cute for a holiday say if you're
going on a holiday with your friends
like a girls holiday or something and
you wanted a really extra outfit what a
festival say if you go to festivals that
are abroad and it's a little bit hotter
and you want to wear something really
sort of I catch in because this would
definitely catch tonight okay I don't
know it's a bit of an odd one it's a
business about these quickly because I
don't actually have Tryon clips of these
which is super disappointing but it
genuinely could not get these over my
hips so the first one is a bunny sue
it's part of the collie Bible collection
which I love Carly Bible I love the
stuff that she brought out personally I
was more of a fan of the first
collection she did with misguided but I
do love her sort of fashion and style
and stuff like that I'll go so basically
everyone's complaining about the fit are
there and someone said that it's nice
but it's not suitable for people with a
big chest and what else do they say
basically not suitable for anyone who
doesn't have a super flat stomach
basically saying it's not true to size
I'm an A and I struggle to do up the zip
so I did get this
a it's actually reduced now I think it's
about sixteen pounds let me just check
yet 16 pounds reduce some 440 pounds
which 40 pounds is pretty expensive for
a body suit one thing I will say is the
actual in like the inside it's all silk
inside and it feels really soft really
comfortable feels really nice quality I
love the color I love the sort of design
like the actual style of it I love all
the lace on it it's just a shame that I
genuinely I could not get this over my
hips but also I got a size 8 which is
what I always get him body suits because
the lace it gets to a point where it's
just lace and it's not got any stretch
whatsoever so usually with a lot of body
seats you can kind of stretch them a
little bit and fit them over you your
hips and you bomb or whatever but
because this has got no stretch it just
would not go over at all same with this
one so this again is a bodysuit
it's a little bit hard to show because
it's got different sections and straps
and all sorts going on days so that is
the throne I don't know if you can see
but it's basically like a really deep
plunge and then it's got this strip of
fabric that goes down the center of your
boobies so I'll actually write this as
being too big and she said I'm a 10/12
and 5 foot 3 5 foot 3 but the size 10
was far too long on the body
I couldn't even get this on oh it's such
a shame again it just got to a point
like this material where it tends to
mash and sequin I just could not stretch
that over my hips whatsoever again
couldn't get it over my head like it's
really tricky to get on because it's got
so many different straps and holes on
the cover okay moving on to something
that I did actually really like this is
probably my favorite piece in the whole
haul if we're gonna call it a hole okay
so this has three reviews this is a kind
of long MIDI bodycon dress like just all
black so this has actually got three
like pretty review it's basically
saying either the material is too thin
and the quality is just like not there
so it's saying that cops don't have any
shape because there's not any wiring in
so basically it's a midi dress like a
black of midi dress and the top section
is it's got padded cops which I do
really like again there's no way to
adjust the straps which maybe that would
have solved some people's problems if
they could have adjusted the straps
luckily it fit me quite well
the actual material is kind of like a
crappy material I don't know if that
makes any sense it's got a little bit of
texture to it I don't find that it's too
thin I mean you could definitely see
like my underwear line I feel like if
you walk the right underwear then it
wouldn't be a problem though this is
only 18 pounds and I probably will keep
this until something that was a little
bit more of a disappointment
so this is just a yellow kind of Jersey
cotton dress again it's kind of like a
MIDI length it goes just below the knees
it's alone at low net its long sweetie
you just want men to say and then it's
just got a round NAT go this is 15
pounds and again I feel like with this
you'd get what you pay for because the
quality is not the best I'm not gonna
lie both reviews it has to one star
reviews and both of them say that it's
basically just to see through which one
hundred percent agree with as soon as I
put this on you could just see
everything didn't have a brow anything
on I just had like me next on and like I
said I do wear black Calvin Klein's just
to see actually how sifu stuff was and
you could see right through them and I
actually had to cover my my hoops with
my hands as well because you could see
every part okay every little bit of
nipple was on show it's just a shame
because like it is really soft really
comfortable but it's just beyond the
thing like it's not wearable at all yeah
I'm something a bit more expensive
this again is a dress it's more like a
dressier dress I would say so I got this
in a 10 because I'm pretty sure it's
actually oh they have it back in stock
now but I think when I ordered this they
didn't have it in an a oh it does
actually have one really good review I'm
saying that it's nice fitted and it
looks pretty and blah blah blah rest of
them though aren't so good okay then has
three one star review the colo was not
the same the quality was terrible I'm
normally an ape I had to get a size ten
it came through I didn't had no stretch
at all the material was horrible had
zero stretch and it was see-through not
true size came up really small I do
agree with the fact that in some areas
of the dress it comes up pretty small so
it's basically a blazer dress in a way
it's kind of like a nudie peach color
this color looks awful on me like it
looks just so wrong looks like I'm ill I
don't know if that makes any sense for
it just makes me look well so yeah I got
a tan I do completely agree in some
places
fitted weighting small like the hips for
example like it felt so tight on my hips
it was also really short like it was
shorter than I expected it to be I even
if this fitted really well I wouldn't
feel comfortable going out in it just
because it's the sort of thing where
when you start walking around like it
just rises up and up and our test area
was so big like it just felt really
really big so yeah this isn't cheap
either it's 40 pounds which is pretty
expensive for a dress like a mini dress
anyway so unto a kind of date I'm more
casual dress I do have a pair of jeans
but I'm not gonna go through them or
show them because I just looked on the
website and they must have been pulled
or sold out so I can't find them
anywhere so it's not really much clean
so it only has one one-star rating and
it's pretty brief it's pretty vague so
it basically just says there's nothing
like the photo I ordered this just
before Christmas and it looks nothing
like the picture unfortunately I have to
disagree I feel like it definitely does
look like what it looks like on the
model this is a little bit hardest show
because at the minute is just one big
bit of fabric I have to say this was the
most confusing dress to put on ever
because you have to like wrap it round
and put some buttons through things and
all sorts to actually get it to fit and
look right this was 25 pounds which
isn't too bad for a dress like this I
would say do have some dresses that are
really similar to this from misguided
that I do really like this one however I
can't put my finger on it but there's
just something that doesn't look right
on me and the fit of it is absolutely
fine I've got this in a size aid and I
would say it's true to size I like the
fact that it's quite useful straps how
many times to say this but it does have
adjustable straps which had it not have
them it would have just been it gaping
on my chest and it fits pretty well I'll
give it that it fits pretty well the
only thing that I don't like well
there's two things that I don't really
like about it the whole thing kind of
relies on the bow that you tie at the
side so it's the sort of thing where you
kind of wrap it over and then you tie it
in a little bow and the whole dress like
staying together just relies on that bow
staying in place which when I first
tried it on I it kind of kept slipping
out which you don't want to be wearing
something out and about and then all of
a sudden it just comes completely undone
and your whole body is just out on show
also I feel like this would look so much
better if it didn't have the little
straps here so it's basically got a lot
of spaghetti
traps and then it has off-the-shoulder
frilly straps which on the model it
looks really cute but for some reason
when I took my arms out of them and
tried it on with just the normal
spaghetti straps I just felt like it
looked a lot better it's not bad it's
not like my favorite thing ever but it's
just it's not a bad piece either like if
you like this kind of jazz and you feel
like it's something that would look
really flattering on you then you'll
probably really like it so this is a
dress it's a mini dress again
very sure like the actual skirt section
was really short on my legs got quite a
deep plunge but what I will say is I
absolutely love the top section of this
like I wish I could have this in a
bodysuit so all of the top section is
basically just nude with black lace over
the top and then the sleeves are kind of
just black match so kind of a bit
see-through bible' something Oh stuff
like that this is just gorgeous I'm
obsessed with this fit really really
well and then you come down to the skirt
section and like the lower part of the
dress I just don't get this first of all
like it's just not really my cup of tea
it's basically got lace that goes in
like zig zags around the bottom of the
dress section that made no sense at all
but they've got tassels going all the
way around as well which I just don't
get it because I feel like the top
section it looks really nice and feels
expensive it feels really good quality
and then it kind of just ruins it with
all these tassels and like the bottom
half I feel like it makes it look a bit
cheap I don't know if that's just me but
a lot of people were saying that it was
broken false he and the zip was broke
there was a number of faults it wasn't
stitched correctly
someone's actually put pitches because
you can't actually add felt those to
your to your reviews as well which I
like I put this on okay and I started
filming the Tron clip and straight away
one of the tassels just came loose and
just fell all over the floor
I've got a little black tassels all over
my floor right now quality isn't great
it's such a shame because the top half
is gorgeous I need this in a bodysuit
there's no need for the tassels anyway
you could have just extended all of this
and made it a dress and it would have
been so cute if you like the style of it
and stuff I feel like for 15 pounds it's
not too bad you just have to hope that
it doesn't sort of all fall apart which
is basically what I started doing for me
okay last but not least again this is in
the sale this just looked
so cute on the website I love the vibe
of there is basically a jumpsuit that is
like a pajama jumpsuit so it's a navy
color I love this color at the minute
Navy like I just I don't know there's
something about it that I really like
got little kind of prints all over it
little white patterns little black
pattern stuff like that it just looks
like really cute PJs so the top section
it's kind of like a bit of a v-neck and
it's got a little pocket here and then
it's got a little waistband that it
comes to it as well and then it just
goes down into wide leg trousers actual
material is really nice it's a bit thin
but it feels soft and comfortable which
I like so this has one one star review
and it basically is just saying that the
sizing is off she ordered a size six no
she is a size six they didn't have it in
her size so she ordered the four and
still found that it was way too big I
actually looked this I think it's really
cute really comfy really nice to just
throw on in the evening because it's
like it's like a onesie for example like
it's just a nice thing to put on in the
evening before you get into bed I mean
in the photo the model is wearing this
with a pair of heels which I'm just
living for her I feel like it's the sort
of thing that you put on in the evenings
when you're doing your skincare and
you're having a pump night and doing
face masks and you just feel that little
bit extra you know so that was
everything out of all the stuff we
bought so how many things got by there
must be way over 10 so I bought one two
three four five six seven eight nine ten
eleven twelve thirteen things so I
bought 13 things I'd say out of
everything there were three things I
absolutely loved so the white bralette
and the last thing I showed that which
was the blue pajama jumpsuit and also
the black bodysuit dress body suit black
bodycon dress is what I might say and
then there were three things that were
kind of like like they weren't bad but
I'm not obsessed with their which was
the sequin halterneck bralette situation
also the dress like the yellow floral
dress that had all the ruffles and star
but don't love it but I don't hate it
it's not like a bad piece and also the
jeans which I can't seem to find but
they were just mom jeans like basic mom
jeans and I did actually really liked
them everything else though was a solid
path in my opinion I don't know 50
percent of it was okay 50 percent of it
was no I feel like that's better than
all of it being a know which is what you
would expect with her video
so yeah if you want me to do a part two
of this or if you want me to do any of
the clothing runs please let me know in
the comments down below and let me know
if there's any specific pieces that you
want me to try out but yeah I'm gonna
get going anyway so I really hope you
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
watching as always I love you guys
swimming back a million times over and
I'll see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
