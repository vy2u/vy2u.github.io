I hope you all.. my hands never know what to do in intros
Can I just say that right now? So whenever I'm just sat here like waving, clapping, doing strange things
That's why but yeah, welcome to today's video. I hope you're all well and having a lovely day today
We're doing a tutorial slash get ready with me on this makeup look right here, which is basically an ultimate drugstore glam. I
Wanted to create something..
Because I feel like there's a lot of stuff coming up at the minute where you want to do really glam makeup. Prom's
Coming up for some people and it's my birthday coming up in July. It's just summer in general - leavers balls, proms
Birthdays, nights out, whatever you want to be doing
I just wanted to create something that was like a
universal glam look that I feel like you could wear with any dress - any outfit for that matter. Any colours, any
Eye colour like this will suit all eye colours. Because it's all drugstore
It's all super affordable as well apart from like one thing, the powder that I used wasn't drugstore
But I do give you an alternative. Honestly, I am
Obsessed with this makeup. I love it so much. I love the way it's come out
I've had so much fun creating it and I really hope you all like it as well
so let me know in the comments if you're gonna be recreating this and if you've got anything to wear it for because I would
Love to know what you guys are up to at the minute.
All of the products will be linked down below as well
If you're interested in picking any of them up for yourself, and I'm just gonna get cracking
So if you want to see how I did this makeup look then please just keep watching.
So I've just gone ahead and primed my eyes
So I've just used the concealer that I'm gonna use later on in the video to highlight underneath the eyes
Which is just see makeup revolution and conceal and define, you know, which one I mean
So I'm gonna go in with the makeup revolution in collaboration with soph does nails palette. I absolutely love this palette
I feel like it's got everything you need whether you doing a daytime look, evening look, glam look, whatever you want to do
so I'm gonna start with this shade here, which.. I don't have the
Insert for like the names anymore
So I'm not entirely sure what it's called, but it's just like this warm brown on the end
And I'm just taking that on a Backstage Beauty Blender brush
So this is gonna go directly in at the crease
I used a nip and fab translucent powder to set the eyes and I can just already tell I don't like it.
This is just gonna be our like initial transition colour, so I'm not being too
Neat. I'm literally just whacking it in the crease.
Okay
So I put a layer of fake tan on last night and I feel like I don't even look any darker
Like what the hell. I use loving tan and I feel like loving tan is such a good fake tan
But sometimes it just doesn't show up on my skin. It's so weird
I don't know if anyone else uses that and guess what I mean? It's like sometimes it gives a really good dark coat
I always use the same one as well
I always use the two-hour express dark tan because like I know that's gonna be the darkest like sometimes it just doesn't develop properly
I don't understand. It's really weird. I'm just building this up. I am doing eyes first because I feel like with
More glam makeup you want to kind of save your skin for last. I'm gonna go in with..
What am I gonna go in with? I don't know. I think I'm gonna go in with this shade here
So it's like diagonal to it. So it's kind of just a fudgey Brown
It's not as warm, but it's still a really pretty colour. I'm gonna go in with a makeup geek soft dome brush
It's just a little bit more tapered. Again putting this in the crease, but because this is a smaller brush it's just gonna
not blend it as high up.
It's gonna be a little bit lower down. Actually really in love with makeup geek brushes at the minute
Like I didn't try them before and the master class in Manchester, before I did like the collaboration with Marlena and Beauty Bay
But honestly they're such good brushes
I'm gonna go in with this shade here
Which is just like a really nice kind of rich warm red color and I'm gonna take that on a tapered blending brush
So this is just a Mac 217. I'm gonna start patting this on the outer corner. I
Love this shade like loveeee this shade.
I'm gonna take it out quite far as well because I'm gonna actually clean up with a wipe today, which I don't usually do
But I want to make that outer corner like really smoky
So I'm not gonna try and be too neat because we'll clean it up anyway
I'm gonna go in with this shade here as well. So I'm just gonna go in and do the exact same thing
Literally just building up the colour. I'm gonna go back in with a bit of the transition colour.
I feel like we're losing it here. And then I'm gonna go in with a touch of the black as well just on the same
Brush, I realize it's looking messy, but trust me. It'll be fine once it's cleaned up. I'm just gonna pop that right
on the outer corner and just
kind of concentrate it more towards the lashline and
The very lower part of the crease. This is actually a really good black like for a drugstore palette
Like it's super super
intense. I'm gonna go in with a wipe and
Just clean up
Underneath. I've not done this technique in so long
But you literally just want to start.. I don't start right at the corner of my eye
Because I feel like you want the shadow to link up when you do the lower lash line
So you kind of need to leave a little bit of space here. So I start just below
And just start cleaning it away. Always do it too low and make your way up because the minute you do it too high
Like you can't really fix that. Okay, so I've got this product here that's by Kiko. I kind of class Kiko is drugstore,
I know you can't get it in boots and stuff. But I think the price point is drugstore.
So this is the into the dark metallic eyeshadow. It's kind of a similar concept to like the Stila Magnificent metals..
it's kind of like a
Flat applicator and you can carve out your crease and stuff like that, and it's like a metallic shadow
So I'm gonna use this on the lid just to carve out the crease. I've not tried these before so
Hopefully, it's good. This is in the shade. Oh my gosh, it's really runny. It's like literally going everywhere
So, I'm just gonna use this - whoa
That's gold
I
Need to find a way to blend this because it's looking a bit crazy
I'm just gonna take a pencil brush by makeup geek and I'm just gonna go in with the darker brown shade that we used
and kind of just
Mesh this edge a little bit. So I'm gonna mix two glitters. These are by NYX,
These actually came in a set at Christmas so I don't think they're available anymore, but I'm just gonna mix
Gold which is just the gold on top. That's up here. And then I'm also gonna mix
Luna is it? I think this one here. I'm gonna use a bit of NYX glitter glue as well.
This is actually what comes in the set, but you can buy this individually in like a bigger
packet. I'm gonna go in with a Mac 242
That's like my favorite brush to pop glitter and pigments on with. Pop this over
The pigment a little bit and then just go in with some glitter
Okay, for lashes
I'm going to use the ardell faux mink lashes in the style 811 I think? Or I think they're just called faux mink.
They're literally just kind of like longer at the end, kind of like a cat eye
So a similar vibe to what we've got on the eyes.
And they're drugstore so I've not tried these before but I'm gonna give them a whirl.
Okay
So lashes are on I didn't actually use the Ardell ones in the end because I just felt like there were a little bit too
Natural for this look. These are like kind of drugstore ish. I mean, they're not, you can't get them in Boots,
you have to get them online, but they're not like
Expensive expensive lashes. So these are by Backstage beauty and these are in the style Beverly Hills
They basically have a bunch of like faux mink lashes that I'm just obsessed with
So these are Beverly Hills. I do have a discount code with backstage as well. Which gets you 10% off
I believe these are about Â£12 ish
But I do have a 10% code if you want to use it. I'll put it on the screen here
It's just HANXRENEE10. So yeah, these are what I've got on now. Really easy to apply
I haven't actually wore this style before but they were super easy to apply and the lash band is nice and thin
Which is nice because I've not got any liner or anything like that. So these are the eyes so far
So for primer, I'm gonna use the Rimmel lasting finish 8 hour wear makeup primer. I love this,
It's one of my favorite drugstore primers. It just comes in a little red bottle like this
They do have a similar bottle for a different primer, which is blue but I use this one.
It's a little bit more moisturising and hydrating in my opinion. I really need to get my nails redone.
They like at that stage now where they start
flicking off from the back if you know what I mean
You know when they start getting all weird. Whenever I get my acrylics off or get them redone
it makes me realise how weak my nails are underneath. It's ridiculous. For foundation
I'm gonna use the same one that I used in my last video. So this is the L'Oreal 24-hour
infallible Pro glow in the shade
204. I know someone asked in my last video in the comments where you can buy this from and I
Don't think it's in Boots, like something just tells me it's not in Boots at the minute.
I don't know if it's been brought out
yet in like boots and Superdrug, but I'm pretty sure you can get it on Amazon in the UK
I'll try and find somewhere and link it down below. Anyway, just gonna pop this on.
It's probably gonna be, well.. I can already see that it's gonna be too dark which, it is what it is!
And then the brush that I'm using is just a makeup geek
What is this? A face buffer brush, so I just use this to sort of disperse
The product and then I'm gonna go in with a sponge on top. I'm actually gonna do cream bronzer next.
So I'm just gonna use the B makeup contour stick. Oh, it's got a highlight shape as well
But I only ever use this side and I do really like this product
I used this in my testing B makeup video if you've not seen it. Just gonna put this
around my cheekbones
my temples
This kind of sheers out quite a lot like the hoola
one from benefit so.
Don't worry,
you can kind of just slap it on. Gonna go in with a backstage foundation brush and just
Push that into the skin. Oh my god, my cat brought a bird in yesterday
I was actually distraught, like not even just a normal bird. It was a baby Robin.
It was like a little tiny tiny chick.
I don't know if it's just me
But honestly if my cats ever bring stuff in like I actually got so upset. It upsets me
Especially if they're alive, I feel like if they're dead..
say if they bring a mouse in and they've already killed it, then it's not as bad but
Crunchie brought this baby Robin in because we've got like a little nest of Robins like just outside in the garden, and
one of them, like one of the chicks must have
jumped out the nest to start learning to fly. And then
crunchy being the absolute evil bitch that she is obviously saw that it couldn't fly because it was kind of just tottering around the
garden
and I didn't think anything of it at first. She obviously just went and snatched it because she realised it was
Vulnerable and like couldn't, couldn't fly basically. But yeah, that's why I did yesterday.
I was at home all day and honestly me and Dad spent like a solid hour
trying to just look after this little bird and
watch over it. And then she kind of just came into my room later on, Crunchie, and she just was like
Miaow, like she just knew she was in trouble.
I'm gonna do concealer. I'm just using makeup revolution
Conceal and define, I think it's called.
Okay, so for powder I am actually just going to use a Charlotte Tilbury powder which obviously isn't drugstore but the Nip &amp;amp; fab one.. so I
have this Nip &amp;amp; fab powder that I used to set my eyes and I can just tell I
Don't like it like, you just know when it's just not right for your skin.
So I was gonna use that but I'm just gonna use Charlotte Tilbury to be safe.
One drugstore powder that I 100% recommend though
And I kind of wish I had because I do actually prefer it - is Rimmel Stay matte powder.
I'm obsessed with it, it's my holy grail  pressed powder. I don't have it here with me
So I'm gonna have to use this instead
But I genuinely do actually prefer it to this and I'd rather use that than this one. I don't have it
So we're just gonna have to make do. That is in the shade one, by the way, that's the shade that I use.
So I'm just gonna set my whole face with that same powder
As I said, any powder will do to be honest
But Rimmel stay matte is my favourite drugstore powder. In terms of brows, I think I'm gonna give this a go first
So this is by NYX and it is.. nearly just dropped it. This is the precision brow pencil in the shade ash brown
it's kind of like a
Straight edge if that makes sense, so it's not like a typical
triangle shape, it's more just like a little square. So hopefully this will do
The job. I'm just gonna brush them through first. So I'm just gonna run it through
And then just bring it round. I
Always go a little bit higher on the arch because my arch isn't as thick as the rest of my brow.
That did a really good job, that was like super easy to use
The actual shape of it made it really easy to define and create the shape.
I'm gonna use the NYX brow mascara in the shade espresso just to set them
in place and
Then in terms of bronzer, we've got the NYX contour and highlight palette. So I'm just gonna um,
Mix, I don't know..
I think I'll use this shade first because this is the warmest and then maybe contour a little bit with that one
And then for contour I'm just gonna use a makeup forever
165 brush. So it's just a little bit more tapered. I'm literally just concentrating this right at the base of
Where we bronzed.
That looks super ashy actually.
Okay, so I realise that looks a little bit grey and a little bit heavy.
I probably put, well, I have put too much on so
Don't mind that! For highlighter I'm gonna use the L'Oreal foiled highlighter in the shade
rose quartz, you guys know, I'm obsessed with this. What I will say about this highlighter is it's very soft
So if you rub the bristles too much it kicks up like a lot of product
Just going to dust this on.
I'm just gonna spray a little bit of the models own one-night-stand setting spray because I feel like my skin
looks a little bit kind of powdery. It just needs like a little bit of hydration, you know.
Right that's definitely helped I feel like highlighter has just saved the day. Oh my under-eye, I've not even done that
yet, I was about to just do lips and call it a day!
So I'm just gonna blend the same kind of shades.
So I'll start with this one under the eye and then go into this kind of red shade here.
I might use a little bit of like the dark one on the very outer corner as well
I'm just gonna use another tapered brush. So this is by
Djulicious. You can see what I mean now about how I've left that shadow down a little bit but it's linking up really well
With the lower lash line, so it just looks a lot more like tied together.
I'm gonna put a tiny bit of that highlighter by l'orÃ©al on the inner corner
Just to highlight that. So I've got a lip pencil here by NYX
I'm just going to use the suede matte lip liner in the shade Leon. It's just kind of like a nudie, rosy pink.
And then I've got the liquid lipstick by Rimmel in the shade latte to go.
This is one of my favourite liquid lipsticks of all time. I definitely recommend it - really affordable,
lasts really long and it's really comfortable. And then I'm just going to throw on a gloss by Kiko
This is in the shade 19. It's the 3D hydra lip gloss. I really like the applicator on this,
It's just like a flat kind of applicator but it's really flexible and stuff. It just feels good on the lips.
Okay, so this is the..
just dropped a ring. This is the finished look! I am
Obsessed with this like I love it so much. I've not done like a super glam
Look for quite a while now. I have to be honest, when I wear makeup these days
I just do something really natural and kind of minimal unless I'm going out and then I'll make
More effort, but I don't go out much anymore!
So I feel like I've not done something really glam like this in a long time and I just love it, like I've just had
so much fun creating this
look. I really hope all of you like it as well and you
Like the fact that it's a little bit more affordable and stuff like that.
I tried to use as many affordable products as possible. But yeah, I really hope you all enjoyed it
Thank you so so much for watching. I love you guys so much as always, to the moon and back.
