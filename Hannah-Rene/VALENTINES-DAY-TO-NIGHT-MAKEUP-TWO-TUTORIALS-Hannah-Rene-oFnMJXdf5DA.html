hey guys it's hand so totally out is
going to be a tutorial it's like a
two-in-one tutorial it's basically a
valentine's day day to night lot I've
never done a sort of like date tonight
look before I start off with like a more
minimal sort of daytime look and then I
transform it into a nighttime look so
I'm so excited to be doing this and I
really hope you guys I can't let me know
if you do and I will do more sort of
types of these tutorials right right
obviously this is the more dramatic look
which I shown you towards the end
and the first one is a lot more full of
like soft glam depending on what you are
doing for Valentine's Day if you know
anything at all you don't be put off by
Valentine's date you don't okay like I
don't have a BAE I'm still going to find
a way to wear this makeup
believe me I'm kind of toasted as well
to do like a video that's like 5 things
to do on Valentine's Day
if you single let me know if you want me
to do that because I was talking to some
of my friends I saw and we came up with
some really good ideas so I'll upload
that and film it next week if you want
it but if not it's fun let me know so
yeah this is obviously like the super
dramatic one that's kind of what it's
like three looks in one because I'll
show you this look with a nude lips as
well so I really hope you like all 3 let
me know in the comments which is your
favorite wine
and make sure you give this video a
massive thumbs up if you want me to do
more tutorials like this that I like
date tonight you don't know anyway
because my camera is flashing the
battery is about to die but I really
hope you enjoyed this video and if you
want to see how I achieve this vlog
can't be more a daytime look as well
just keep watching okay so starting off
with a completely bare face we're going
to do skin today you're going to have to
my mother ways by the way because I've
got such a sore throat and I'm just
using the number 7 beautiful skin day
cream I love this stuff I've not used it
in a really long time but I got a new
part and I just absolutely adore it
makes you look so chewy and hydrated and
cleanse so I'm just popping it on with a
split fiber brush by Mark because
they're no fun so using my hand today I
don't know why and then I'm just going
to put some primer on so I'm using the
Nivea post shave balm and again just
apply this with a brush you guys know
this is like my favorite primer
ever even though it's not technically a
primer but it does a very good at job so
yeah just learning that full down the
neck as well and then we're going to go
on to foundation I'm just using the
Makeup Forever HD stick I use the shade
white 3 to 5 if anyone wants to know
because I do see some comments asking
sometimes and just soften it all in with
a I think this is a multi and for 3:9
literally just patting it in
pushing it into the skin because that
gives the best coverage and as you can
see it actually matches my son for once
which is really nice so just learning
that all over the face as you can see
it's got a really beautiful dewy finish
as well so it looks lovely unlike normal
to dry skin and then I'm just going to
take a darker stick I think this is why
four for five but I'll leave the shades
down below remember the news it's a
cream sort of like bronze so I'm
basically warming up the skin a little I
feel like doing this enhances bronze
when it makes it or last a lot longer as
well so I'm just hoping some popping
that from where my cheekbones are and
then also on my temples and around the
jaw line and just blending out with a
smaller buffing brush and I'm using the
exact same motions because they're like
a similar foundation I don't swipe I
still just like push it into the skin as
you can see me do in and I feel like
they just combine really well and they
like melt into each other and they just
look absolutely flawless and stunning so
on the neck I do sort of drag it down a
little bit just to blend it and but yeah
it does look quite warm don't mind that
it does look like better wants the
bronzers added then we're just going to
go in with some concealer so I'm mixing
it Maybelline fit me in the shade 10 and
then also applying a little bit of the
NARS radiant creamy as well just because
it's slightly paler so it highlights a
little bit more and we're just having it
under the eyes on the chin when my smile
lines are and then also on my nose and a
very little bit on the center of my
forehead as well and then as you can see
at the nose one is slightly lighter so
I'm just popping that where my
cheekbones are where I want an extra bit
of highlight and then I'm just going to
blend it all out with a Beauty Blender I
feel like you've seen we do these steps
a million times and but I like using a
Beauty Blender for concealer because it
absorbs the excess and it helps to
prevent any sort of unnecessary crease
in so I'm just again patting that in not
dragging it or swipe now or anything
like that because we want to keep the
coverage there and then I'm going to set
everything in place with some that stay
matte by Rimmel I've been really
enjoying this part of recently I feel
like I'm the last person to love it
because it's been going around for so
many years now but I do really like it
because it feels very lightweight on the
skin but it does a good job of setting
as well and it kind of just takes away
any unnecessary shine because the makeup
forever stick in particular is really
chewy then I'm just going to do brows
off-camera I'm going to do a brow
routine soon so you will see how I do
them then starting on two eyes were only
using two eyeshadows for the state and
look which is so cool like I love it
when it's just minimal stuff so
and first I've taken a creme brulee by
makeup geek I believe this is I'm just
having this in the crease with a marker
to t4 and I'm not being particularly
messy because when it's a daytime look I
kind of just work it in the crease so
it's good to go and but yeah just
blending it from the outer corner to the
inner corner as you can see and then the
only other shade I'm going to use is
been passed out by Mac which technically
isn't an eye shadow it's a Porsche but
oh my goodness
if you do not have any blushes by Mark
that you use as eyeshadows you really
need to pick them all because we do such
a beautiful job and if you likely have
way more like warmer sort of nice crease
shades in the blushes than they do in
shadows and so yeah I definitely
recommend them and then I am just doing
the same on the lower lash line and I'm
going to do the technique that I always
do when I got foundation on first I'm
basically going to extend my lower lash
line as you can see me doing here
and then just blending it into the
crease colors again so this just helps
me keep everything clean like if you
want to do it a different way and you
want to be messy and then wipe away
that's fine but I just prefer doing it
like there once I've got the outline I
just go in with a t17 I think this is a
two and seven or an e25 by Sigma either
way it's a tapered blending brush and
I'm still just using that burnt pepper
shade and just building on top of it so
we've got like layers of colors and then
I just go back in with a big blending
brush and just sort of smoke it all out
and it should look something like so but
yeah I'm not particularly like tidy with
daytime locks I just sort of wax off on
my eyes and then just leave it as you
can see me doing here so though this is
what it should look like when you are
done just something nice and simple and
sultry and smoky
all of that is hello and then I'm going
to use some black eye shadow any black
will do but I'm using crooks by makeup
geek I'm just going to pressure press
this into the upper lash line and to
prepare for falsies you don't have to
wear fall to fall oh my goodness I
cannot speak you don't have to wear
falsies for this look if you don't want
to but I am like I just love working on
a para falsies especially if it's for
like a Valentine's Day or something I
just think they look nice and flirty and
fun so having some mascara on and then
I'm going to use J makeup which looks
like this for the daytime looks and my
favourite lashes like ever and I just
think that absolutely stunning so those
are our daytime lashes and then I'm
going to do some lower lash mascara as
always just make sure they balance out
with the top sort of falsies then unto
and runs there and using Too Faced
chocolate Soleil
and I'm just learning this on my
cheekbones temples jawline all the
places I usually would I have just
filled in my high line as well like in
case you notice that my hair is sort of
like going a little bit darker at the
roots I always do this when I've got a
tight pony and just because like it
blends up with in a lot better and it
stops me getting in like a sort of line
between where my skin's quite fat and
where it's got fake tan and like a dark
foundation on it does look quite
intensive so I start as you can see
blending out with a foundation brush and
but it's just a really good tip if you
have fake tan and a darker foundation
like me but you like wearing a tight
bond just to make sure that you have
plus my hair is dyed like this isn't my
natural colour so I do have to just
correct it a little bit then unsee you
highlighter I'm using the makeup for
ever at pro light fusion in the shade 2
just because I feel like it's such a
beautiful glow like this is my favorite
daytime highlighted because it's nothing
too intense it just looks like your skin
is super luminous and dewy
yes blue and then we're going to finish
off we lips so I'm using step down by
Mark I feel like this is my go-to like I
use it all the time for a nude lip I
love it and I'm just lining my whole
lips and sort of over drawing up a
little bit in places that need it then
for the actual lipstick I'm going to use
one by Anna Savia which is in the shade
it's a liquid lipstick in the shaded
which looks like so I'm just going to
pop this on the center and blend them
together these two are such a good match
like I've only recently started using
that anasazi one but I love it like it's
my go-to nude lip now kind of it's like
almost replacement see so this one even
though I still love that and so I'm just
probably notes all over the lips and
blending it in with the liner like so
and then you just want to top off with
some gloss so I'm using the buzzer glass
by NYX in the shade fortune cookie this
is like my fave
mousse gloss ever it makes you look look
so glossy as well like it's really
intense which I just love and so I'm
just popping that on top just to sort of
like make it a look to make it look a
little more shiny and then I'm finish it
off with some shoe a skinny dips as well
and this is the finished look for
daytime nice and sort of sultry and
girly and flirty so perfect like daytime
dates or things like that or if you is
going out shopping or out and about
you know what I mean but now we are
going to switch it up into something a
little bit more glam like Hello little
wink so you just want to start by taking
off the falsies because we're going to
go for drama llama on the eyes today
boys and girls we're not about
well I really need to start but
seriously whip those falsies up or if
you've just got mascara and you don't
even need to do this step because we're
going to do more dramatic eyes now so
going back in it with that Mac palette
I'm taking a double blusher and I think
it's called apple red and they'll be
linked down below but they just might go
through so like red creases I'm just
taking the same c24 and starting to
deepen that crease up because we want
something nice and bold and red since
it's Valentine's Day and then I'm going
to take this in my makeup geek and mix
it with the one mattum about 2.2 which I
don't know the name of but I will link
it down below and I'm going to do a
video soon about my link elite shadows
because I know a lot of people want that
so do not worry I will do that and I'll
just mix in those two and popping those
in the outer corner as you can see and
just learning it back into the crease
because we want to create a little bit
more definition seeing as we're going
for a more evening a nighttime look now
I'm also going to put it on the inner
corner as well as some using and I think
you should make up forever pencil brush
to apply it just to make it nice and
precise I'm just going to pop it on the
very inner corner so it creates a sort
of halo eye as you can see and then you
just want to blend the two together and
you will have something that looks along
the lines of this then we're going to go
in with curtaincall but make it eat this
is the most beautiful foiled eyeshadow
ever like it's just a bright cherry red
and that's going to be like our pop of
shimmer on the lid so I'm just packing
that on with a two for two like so as
you can see there was a lot of fallout
from it but don't worry as long as
you've set your face well and there's
like it's not too and sticky from the
foundation you'll be absolutely fine
then we just want to go in with a wing
like obviously this is optional but I
wanted to do a wing twist look because
as I said we're doing dramarama
so I'm just creating it the wing first
with an e65 I want to say this is from
Sigma I will link the brushes down below
and I'm just creating the wing and then
dragging it back towards the lash line
because that's my favorite and easiest
way in my opinion to do a wing like I
prefer to create the shape of the wing
first so I'm just taking my time with
this because obviously we've not got
much of a guideline apart from the
shadow that we did earlier and then as
you can see I'm dragging it back towards
the lash line and then you just want to
start throwing it in once you are happy
with the shape so I usually fill in the
wing first and then I just drag it back
to us lashes and do the upper lash line
after that and then I just build up the
wing depending how both you want it like
I like my winged liner pretty intense
but if you just want something quite
kind of like slim and just like a shorts
like then you can totally do that as
well like it's completely up to you
afterwards we are just going to
tightline and with a black liner just to
make sure our lashes look super full and
black like this is a really good trick
just make sure that you falsies I need
actual lashes and all of you winged
liner blends really well because then
you can't see any sort of nude skin
peaking peaking through with and then
you just want to do the same on the
lower lashes as well and because I
wanted to learn quite intense as I've
already said so I'm just popping the
black in the waterline as well and then
it's just the case of buffing the same
crease colors underneath so the what was
it double and apple red and then better
and I'm just popping those on the lower
lash line and then also building up a
little bit of black as well just to make
sure that the black in the waterline
didn't look too stark and it sort of
blended into the warmer shades nicely so
this is what it should sort of look like
once you've done all of those steps and
then you just want to finish up with a
different set or you can use the same
size completely up to you but I'm using
a different set falsies
these are rodeo drive by buck seed
beauty and I've really become obsessed
with them like I know my first
impressions I wasn't entirely sure but I
absolutely loved them so well noticed I
recommend inserting a fab especially if
you like a dramatic lash then I'm just
going to take this Aussies palette by
NYX and I'm just going to use the paler
shade - first up highlight the inner
corners and then also to apply on the
tops of the cheekbones just few intense
intensify the highlight a little bit
more especially if it's an evening look
I feel like you can get away with lining
someone a little bit more so I'm just
going to pop an extra bit of that on as
you can see me doing here and then I
think we've just got lips left to do
yeah so this is the look with the new
but if you want to keep the nude lip
which is what I would probably do not
completely fine and if you are actually
going on a date and you're going to be
kissing some boys then I would recommend
the nude lip because it's not as messy
but if you want a dark lip because you
don't give a and we're going to do
a dark on now so I'm using the leo lip
kit by Kylie which I will show you in a
minute I'm just removing that lipstick
and then also AM Robinson foundation
back on the lips like so and then yeah
Bernie's leo by Kylie and this one
applied a lot nicer than my other darker
red it was my first time using this one
because I do have issues with some of
the darker shades by Kylie but this one
works a lot better so I'm just probably
lip liner on line
my lips as you can see me doing here and
then I do fill in my lips completely
with the liner which I do is pretty much
all my Kylie lip kit and then I just pop
some of the liquid lipstick on top and
that is the finished look so I really
hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial give
it a massive thumbs up if you did let me
