you're all having a fab weekend today I
am gonna be doing a Valentine's Day get
ready with me even though it's like a
third of Feb and it is nowhere near
Valentine's Day you have but I have some
Twitter last night what you wanted to
see for this Sunday's video and a lot of
you asked for this so I thought we'd
just chill get ready together have a
chat things like that I feel that my
earrings are super boring today I'm
slacking a bit so I'm sorry I'm just
gonna start with the L'Oreal my cell app
by face water just to cleanse my skin a
little bit obviously I do clean my skin
and like use a proper cleanser but I
just like to go in with a little bit of
this before makeup just to get rid of
any any excess anything else that needs
to go feel like I'm speaking really
quiet cuz it's a Saturday so like
everyone's at home I always feel so
weird film in one like all the people
around I'm like I'm basically just
talking to myself you're like I'm on a
roller suite this is like the third
video of the week I kind of want to get
back into doing three videos a week
because I want to get back into the
uploading on Tuesdays which by the way
let me know in the comments what videos
you want to see it and also what testing
brands like testing videos you want to
see because I think on Tuesdays I want
to get back in student testing Tuesday
so I think I'm gonna do alternate
between like a makeup brand and a
clothing brand each week I thought that
would be cool my face like my tan on my
face is completely gone out so I just
look so pale I'm just gonna use some of
the Sunday Riley CEO moisturizer of
course and I'm also just gonna pop on
some of the brody'll dragon's blood I
cream it just as our moisturizer and eye
cream yeah I should've learnt from last
time and not put these hips in yet until
the end of the video cuz I can tell
we're just gonna annoy me your brows i'm
gonna use benefit cabral it's just
basically a brow pomade and I use mine
in the shade 5 which I don't know if
this is the darker shade but it's one of
the darker like I never do brows on
camera anymore because it takes so much
concentration I'm just like no but you
know I've got an exciting day today I
felt like I said today's Saturday and my
friend Maddie who is Madison Sarah here
on YouTube I'll hire channel they'll be
here I never know I always forgot what
side it is I'm she's actually getting
married in case none of you knew which
is super exciting I'm so excited for her
and she's asked me to be a bridesmaid
so excited about I've not been a
bridesmaid since my uncle Tim's wedding
which was like years and years and years
ago I just feel super honored you know
so we're going dress fitting today and I
just can't wait I can't wait I'm just
gonna prime my lids with some
heart-shaped tape I'm just gonna mix the
shade medium and light Sun because for
some reason I have three shades of this
concealer and none of them ever honey I
always apply way too much of this
concealer like I always put way too much
on I started filming with I just got
concealer all over my jumper and it's
white great I started filming more so
with natural daylight because like I
felt like my light in alone was just not
bright enough makeup videos okay so as
though this is like a Valentine's Day
kind of look I thought I'd test out the
makeup revolution what color is this
this is the reloaded at neutrals -
palette I feel like it's just
Valentine's Day all over it's full of
like pinks and reds and oranges and
stuff like that so this is the color
selection we've got to work with I just
swatch a couple when I included this in
the hall and they did look really lovely
I think I'm just gonna start with this
shade here obviously there's no names or
anything like that so I'm just gonna
point to them and it's kind of just like
a neutral warmish Brown this palette is
only four pounds as well so we got a
good look out of this I mean that is
pretty pigmented I didn't even put that
much on oh you can put that one on the
brush ya know it's anyone else got any
like weddings coming up because Maddie's
wedding isn't until next year but my
Uncle Tom is getting married in June
which is so excited and just love a good
wedding I just love a good wedding think
I'm gonna take this shade here this is
just like calling me and I'm gonna take
a mock t17 it's quite a lot of kick back
with these like this they're quite
powdery so just bear that in mind tap
off the excess don't know what I'm doing
but I'm just gonna go with it yeah what
is everyone actually doing for
Valentine's Day let me know I'm sure
those of you are gonna comment now and
be like nothing how she know what me and
kind of doing yes the Valentine's Day
probably nothing nothing exciting
anyway what day is Valentine's Day is it
Thursday yeah we probably won't do a lot
we'll probably just stay in and get a
takeaway I'd really love to like make my
own cosmetics one day I have actually
looked into it so I've got really it you
know it's the sort of thing that takes
years cuz there's so much that goes into
it I don't know where I'm going with
this at all just so you know if you've
come here for like a really structured
informative tutorial this is not the
video for you oh my gosh who's excited
for fifty Shades of Grey or Fifty Shades
freed even now so I'm just gonna take
the same red color I think I'm just
gonna keep it quite red I mean it's
Valentine's Day fuck it and I'm just
gonna take that on a Sigma small tapered
which is an e 45 and just place that
right on the inner corner this is like
super easy you literally just pass it on
and then it's done I have got a jump run
by the way but it's just like not here
okay so I'm going to take a Mac two to
eight which is what I use for like cut
increases and like fine details and
stuff like that and then you just want
to take the concealer that you used to
prime it the lids or like why the base
used I'm basically gonna cut in the
middle so how I'm gonna do this is just
because the brush is quite rounded
anyway I'm just gonna shape out just
above my crease so just above where like
the skin kind of folds if that makes
sense white crease is and just start
carving out like around the shape of the
crease so like a little circle just
above and then just fill that in I hope
that makes sense I'm kind of gonna
explain it now because I won't be able
to talk to it that's kind of what you'll
end up with and then you just kind of
feather out the edges a bit okay so that
is what it's looking like
so this is gonna seem like the most
extra thing ever but it's Valentine's
Day so I feel like it's appropriate to
be out sure um I'm gonna mix red glitter
by Mark these are all by Mark actually
so there's red glitter reflex pearl I
believe this is and then Rose Pigman if
you wanted to make it like easy and less
messy you could just use just Rose
pigment but I feel like it's a bit too
pink I still want the pink in it which
is what I'm gonna mix it in if you get
one thing and then you do want to use a
glitter glue or something of the sort so
I'm just going to use two-faced glitter
glue and just pack it on with the same
bro
and you'll just want to go straight over
top with the glitter of mixed together
or just one you don't have to use the
same ones I'm using no the fun part is
to remove all the glitter from
underneath the eyes okay I am gonna do
lashes off camera just to save a minute
okay lashes are on mmm I thought we'd
try out the makeup revolution pro base
aqua primates spray again because I did
really enjoy this when I used it in the
under 30 pants makeup video that that I
did he of the day which I'll put on the
screen here if you'd like to check out
and then I'm also gonna try out the Far
Sally rose gold elixir drops because
everyone raves about these and I've not
tried these ones yet so I'm excited to
give them a girl then the foundation
I've got the la girl pro coverage HD
foundation this is in the shade natural
which I believe is a little bit lighter
than the last shade that I had which was
warm beige
I think obviously it's a little bit
darker than my face but I do have tan on
my body gonna I kind of just apply it
with the brush and then just go over top
with the sponge just to make sure
everything is nice and seamless
I honestly don't know how I used to do
brows after the rest of my makeup like
it was just a game changer as soon as I
started doing brows first I was like wow
I should have been doing this a long
time okay and then I'm actually gonna go
in with the L'Oreal infallible stick in
the shade to-20 toffee because I really
enjoyed this the cream contour yesterday
and you for all of the love on that
video by the way like it's so smooth
really reminds me of my makeup forever
what for like cream contour terms of
like how it lasted it's tough because a
couple of people asked about that on
Twitter and the concealer like the
lighter shade under my eyes didn't last
supper like very long at all which I
kind of accept what am I trying to say I
kind of expected it to fade a bit like I
kind of knew that would fade because it
was like a stick product and stuff like
that the cream bronzer like this lasts
really well that was still on by the end
of the day the foundation shade lasted
pretty well it did sink into like my
fine lines a little bit by the end of
the day and it definitely did look quite
shiny and I saw a couple of comments
saying that they haven't they've tried
the foundation and didn't get on with it
because it was shiny which is strange
because on the website it did so it was
shiny free and it had a matte finish but
it's like I said in the video like it
definitely was not matte on my skin and
as you can see that the sticks don't dry
down they blend like really easily
because they just don't dry so just
something to bear in mind if you are
gonna get it I wouldn't recommend it for
concealer because I don't think it
lasted I do like this shade for cream
contour and the foundation shade like as
a natural foundation stick it's alright
but it's definitely not quite as good as
my makeup for ever'one because I still
stick by what I said like for some
reason it made my paws and it made my
skin look quite Tex shared and by the
end of the day like my paws looked
especially like really big which is not
something I will usually notice on my
skin but all in all I was pretty
impressed like for the price and stuff
and that highlight oh my god I'm gonna
use it again today because I'm obsessed
it wasn't online which I obviously
didn't know when I filmed I only
realized when I went to link it for the
description bar and I asked one of the
lovely girls that I know at L'Oreal what
the deal with it is and she basically
said that it's available only in stores
at the minute so as far as I know it's
definitely in super drug I think it
actually came in like last week which is
so lucky because I had no idea about the
product and I didn't really know if it
was new or not so it's kind of lucky
that I just stumbled across it but yeah
she said it's pretty much just coming to
stores in the UK in superdrug and stuff
I don't know about boots but it should
be online in the near future so yeah now
as you can see it just melts into the
skin it's definitely not matte so if
your oily I don't know how it will work
because some people again in the
comments mention that they tried it and
they were they had more oily skin and it
just kind of melted off their face by
the end of the day yeah so I'm just
going to use top shape tape for
concealer because it's already out and
it's what we used for the eyelids so
again I'm just gonna mix medium
and light Suns so yeah let me know if
you enjoyed it yesterday's video the
Loreal kind of like testing the stick
foundation and if you want me to do a
similar things cuz I'm trying to like
gauge what you guys want to see at the
minute and then I'm just gonna set that
with it brimless Tama again and set my
whole face with that although I did say
actually I'd use the barium drop so I'll
get those out now yeah I'm gonna go in
with some of the liquid chrome highlight
to drop this bye-bye and just so that
you can see what these look like on the
skin minor in the shade beam me up so I
like to just take the dropper and I
actually just drop them on the back of
my hands first so I just put a little
bit on the back of my hand and then I
kind of like warm it up with my finger
so just and then just pop some there you
just want to go in with a sponge I just
do a little bit at a time because I feel
like with liquid highlight so you have
to be so careful you can't get clumps a
little bit with these drops sometimes so
I just kind of rub like really gently
anywhere where it clumps just so you
can't it isn't haha just so it doesn't
remove foundation or anything like that
but yeah those are those obviously you
don't want to SAP where we just
highlight it because that would have
been pointless otherwise okay I'm just
gonna quickly finish off the eyes so I'm
just gonna blend the exact same red
color underneath just to tie everything
together and then you just want to
finish off with some mascara so I'm just
gonna use the Marc Jacobs mascara that I
used for my top lashes okay so those are
the eyes done bought brands that I'm
gonna use the Marc Jacobs tantastic
bronzer just for something a little bit
different
I always forget about this because it's
not in my it's not in like my normal
bronzer collection because the pan is so
big like I have to store it somewhere
else so
it smells so good though it smells like
coconuts
well I'm so super excited about February
as well because I'm not actually like I
mentioned this yet but I'm gonna be
getting an office I'm so excited to just
like have a place that's like separate
to home where I can work because working
from home is like fun at first and then
it just ends up being super stressful
because like you can't really separate
it's hard to separate like work life and
personal life because I work in my
bedroom but my bedroom is my bedroom do
you not I mean so I'm so excited to like
have somewhere where I can actually like
get up and go to work but yeah it's
gonna be Manchester of course I'm so
excited I've got lots of plans when I
get there like I want to start making
more content doing more like stuff on my
second channel things like that so yeah
I'm excited okay and then of course I
thought we had to use the Loreal foiled
highlighter again I just can't not gonna
dip in this is a sigma tapered
highlighter at 35 and the bronzer brush
was a Mac 135 I mean come on come on
like I genuinely think this is the best
drugstore highlights ever like ever made
then I'm gonna go in with a little bit
of blush I'm just gonna use Papa don't
peach by Too Faced all we've got left is
lip so I'm actually gonna use another
two-faced product for this this is such
an old favorite of mine like I used to
wear this 24/7 and this is two-faced
child star it's a liquid lipsticks one
of my favorite liquid lipsticks ever I
got a bit more of like a pink tone going
on so I feel like it will complement the
look quite well and then I'm just gonna
line my lips with Charlotte Tilbury
pillow-talk because again it's kind of
like more of a pinky undertone and then
for glass I'm just gonna go in with the
fancy Beauty what's this called again um
just like the lip gloss in gloss balm
I'm gonna making sure fancy glow of
gloss balm across right so this is the
finished look I really hope you all love
it I've pretty much just got changed on
taking my hair down although my hair
kind of looks a mess so don't mind that
I've not like finished it yet but thank
you so much for watching I really hope
you
the look that came up where that let me
know in the comments if you're doing
anything for Valentine's Day or if
you're just gonna be chilling at home by
yourself with your pets start my line
yeah thank you so much for watching I
love you guys them in a buck a million
times over as always and I'll see you in
the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
