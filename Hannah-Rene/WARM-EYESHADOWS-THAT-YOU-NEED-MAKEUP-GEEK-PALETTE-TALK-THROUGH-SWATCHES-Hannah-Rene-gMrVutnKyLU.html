same video because I feel like it's
taken me so long to do this I've seen so
many people asking for him for some
reason I just like put it off or not
girls doing it or I don't know I don't
have an expense so ladies and gents
today's video is finally etat through on
my makeup geek comic which it looks like
so this is actually one of three
palettes I have actually also have this
one which is like my cool so I'm going
to go through my warm palette say
because I see so many people asking
about this and if you enjoy it and you
also want to know what in this bad boy
which looks like so this is like my more
coal toned eyeshadow palette and kind of
like a random assortment of like car
keys and blues and stuff so if you want
to do this one as well then let me know
I thought I would start off with this
one because I've seen so many people
requesting it as I've said and I feel
like I'll do it because I know I feel
like palette videos don't always do like
that well but for those of you who
really want to see I felt like it was
about time I showed you what was inside
so I'm basically going to be talking
through every single eyeshadow and I'm
going to swatch them and show you like
close-ups and things like that so if you
want any few self you can get them now
I'll put two links in the description
bar below for these eyeshadows I'll put
the us link which is the actual makeup
geek website and I'll put the beauty's a
website for those of you who are in the
UK so depending where you are obviously
like both places ship to other countries
as well but I will put those links down
below so that you can shop what I'm
chatting away this palette is so
frigging dirty I need to get it together
but I didn't ever have it together so
this is what it looks like inside it is
so as custom sighing to look I swear to
God so yeah I pretty much thought this
myself I just picked out all the
eyeshadows some of them is bought and
some of them were very kindly sent to me
so thank you makeup geek so I'm going to
start I'm going to start like how the
actual palette is so I'll start from up
here and I'll do the rows like so so
I'll just go along and tell you the name
of the shade and also like a little bit
about it but bear in mind my ability to
describe colors and things like that is
just not the best so we're going to see
how it goes so in the very top is this
blinding white sort of shimmer eyeshadow
here and this is called ice queen it's
actually one of the very first
eyeshadows ever bought from a cookie
lips Miller ll already off the bottle
it was one is very good I shouldn't that
I got from makeup geek is basically just
like a shimmery white it's mostly just
assassin with a little bit of glitter
and but I use this mostly on the inner
corner and the brow bone when I want
something it's super intense I don't
reach for it tons but I kind of just
like having like a pure white in the
pollux I feel like it can come in useful
and then the next one alum is shimmer
shimmer which again I have had for so
long it was one of the first shadows I
have a bore and again it had a lot of
law so it's basically a little bit
darker than ice cream it's more like a
pinky undertone it's like a pinky
champagne beige I would say it's also a
shimmer but I feel hence the name
shimmer shimmer Murano but I feel like
it's a more intense shimmer than ice
cream so I have to prefer this one on
the inner corner on the brow bone
because I feel like it's extra blinding
so the next one along is called I'm
peach lips which I absolutely love the
name of that I think it's so cute
because it pretty much is just like a
pea it's actually one of the jewel
chromes I'm pretty sure basically
there's a bunch of jewel crumbs in here
as well and they're not labeled on the
back as duo cups duochrome
so I kind of have to guess which ones
they are but I'm pretty sure I'm peach
this is one of them and it's basically
just like a peach color with like
brownish reflex I would say like brown
and gold reflex yeah so it's like a
piece but then when you swatch it it's
got like a pink reflex it's not really
brown or gold that's it's quite pinky
and again it was looked beautiful on the
lid was like a warm brown in the crease
I have to say I don't use it a lot and
but if I do then it goes on the lid and
it just looks really beautiful I'm like
blue green eyes because it really brings
the color out I would love I got a diff
color would be so nice in the springtime
just like all over the lid was like a
matte brown in the crease and that's air
and that's what along is beaches and
cream again it's one of my G's this is
basically just a neutral matte beige I
would say so it's pretty much like a
staple is three in this top row and
peaches and cream peach smoothie and
then also creme brulee right at the very
end all three of them are mattes and the
like my first three my I said is from
makeup geek and they're just really good
like staple neutral pale shadows to go
like in the crease or all over the lid
to set and like a pigment or like an a
cream base or something like that
do we have peaches and cream and then
also Peach Smoothie which is right next
to it
Peach Smoothie it's just a little bit
more peach I would say hence to name it
slightly warmer and certain more orange
tones so depending what you
in the crease if you're more
fair-skinned then I would go with beach
sand cream but if you are like fast
medium or you just like them in a little
bit warmer than I would go Peach
Smoothie but they make such lovely
beautiful transition colors unlike fat
medium skin next along we have in the
spotlight which is the first of the
foiled eyeshadows in this palette so I
have a good few and you can pretty much
tell it when you look at it which are
the foiled ones because they are so
intensely like metallic and shimmery and
just beautiful I love them so in the
spotlight is kind of similar to shimmer
shimmer but like a foiled more intense
version so it's kind of like a champagne
e pink again because if the foiled
eyeshadow is a lot more intense in terms
of like the pigmentation and the
creaminess of it they are a lot softer
to the touch and they almost feel a
little bit wet sorry excuse my voice but
honestly the pigmentation of the foiled
eyeshadows is insane I cannot recommend
them enough and so in the spotlight is
the app basically shimmer shimmer
reminds me a lot of things like make you
lunch by muck as well just like a really
beautiful like pink and toned champagne
colors go over the lid and yeah just
like a really beautiful shade then right
at the end of the top row is creme
brulee and I feel like this is the most
loved color in the palette because it's
definitely the one that I like use and
can I get the most use out of so this is
like my perfect transition color when I
apply it soft ochre all of the lid and I
set it I usually start off with this in
the crease which is exactly what I did
today and then is build on top of it
with other crude colors and then like a
lip color and stuff like that but it is
such a God just God trustee transition
color it's like one of my favorite
colors in this palette again it's one of
like my oldest shades that I like first
ever bought I just don't know I do that
because it really makes this palette one
it okay so starting on the second row
the one at the very end on the ice queen
is called vaulted and I'm pretty sure
again this is one of the duochrome it's
like a really intense gold like a white
gold I would say and what the reflex of
it is like kind of just like a really
bright gold yes if I'm a very yellow
tone gold I would say again it makes a
lovely sort of in a corner for a bow and
highlight if you want something a lot
more like a lovey yellow gold toned
again it would be lovely
on the lid I can't a but I've actually
tried it on the way so I don't what it
looks like
but the duochrome are so stunning
they're like really intensely sort of
metallic yeah
it's really pretty I like it I like it a
lot the next one along is starry-eyed
and again it's one of the foiled
eyeshadows it's actually very similar to
in the spotlight which is the first one
I mentioned on the top row and but it's
not as pink it's like a shade darker and
more like a neutral tone I would say so
if you want something that's like a lid
color but you don't want it to be like
too much of like a dated pink and you
just want it like a little bit more like
in mutual champagne and then I would say
get starry-eyed which is that one at Wow
we actually have another foiled
eyeshadow next to it which is called
magic act and I love this one even more
than starry-eyed because it's a little
bit more me and even though I do have
the sort of pinky tone that foiled
eyeshadows I prefer the more like the
yellowy gold someone so magic axe is
more like a bronzy cool the one next to
it is a matte and it's called peaking
color and again I love this one because
it's a lovely transition color as well
and it's a little bit more like a sticky
brown so it's a lot warmer and a lot
like muskie and sort of the yellowy I
would say like it's a really sort of
already yellow warm sticky brown which
is just for the month it's a new one in
the poet but I absolutely love it it
works really well with creme brulee and
just to add like a little bit of
something over the top next one along
its frappe and it's one of my old ones
again and I absolutely love it it's kind
of like a neutral to sort of reddish
brown we toned transition color again so
these last four maps a little bit more
like a pinky ready Brown I would say so
not like as warm and as like orangey and
I just love this again in the crease
like in the outer V if I am a little bit
more fair-skinned and I'm not going to a
ton on it just it's such a good one
frothy and latte were like two
eyeshadows that I used to use all the
time laughing actually in this power
anymore because I'm getting one among
others but they're just so good they're
very similar but since profuse in here I
obviously use it more and again it just
works really well with creme brulee I
feel like it's a very similar color with
like very similar on deterrence but a
little bit darker so they work really
well together extra frosting got one it
called a bake sale which again I think
is such a cute name and again it's just
like a neutral sort of brown matte
because I swear to God I can
have like enough transition colors in a
palette because I just love using them
all together and mixing it up and trying
different ones like I always like to
have more because they're like my
favorite things to play with and like
build on top ah it's very similar to
frappe as is the one on the end as well
which is called tan lines which is the
very last one on the row
I feel like frappe bake sale and it's
hemlines are all very similar so you
definitely don't need them all mush you
like obsessed like me you know it's hand
lines is a little bit more of like an
orangey Brown
whereas frappe which was the first one
in these two or three is more like a
pinky ready Brown and then big sale
which is in the middle is a little bit
more neutral and it again reminds me a
lot of creme brulee and probably don't
need all three I'm not gonna lie but I
have all three because I'm just like
obsessed with makeup in general but I
just bought them all and they work
really well together again just like
staple much transition colors we're
going on it's you at the middle row we
start off with these two maps here which
are quite similar in terms of like the
actual color but one is just like a
shade darker than the other so we've got
chickadee and earlybird which again love
the names chickadee I use the most
because I mix it a lot with creme brulee
and obviously creme brulee is like a
little bit lighter than what early-bird
is which is like the dark and a yellowy
one here and so if I'm going to use one
or the other I usually do sit with
chickadee just because it's not as
intense well they're pretty much both
like yellow like yellow toned map if
you're like yellow Maps can sometimes
look a little bit intimidating because
it's almost like where would I put that
on my eyes for it to look good and but I
only use the tiniest bit if I'm going to
use one of them and like I said I do
usually make some with creme brulee
anyway I never go in with that one first
usually unless I've got quite a lot of
fake town because especially if you
first kind-- I feel like it can be like
kind of difficult to just go in with
that first and like blend out like I
like to mix it with one of the more
neutral a transition colors it says what
they are so good for dark smoky I say if
you're going to use
goons doom I mean if you're going to use
like a black on the lid and do like a
really intense smoky eye these look so
Stern it in the crease because it stops
that effect of being punched in the face
because you've got the warmth and then
next to those two we've got two more
foiled eyeshadows so we've got legend
and flamethrower legend is kind of like
magic act which is that too right above
except it's a
a bit more darker and a bit more like a
bronze rather than a gold I would say
and flamethrower is like a really lovely
of burnt orange like a flamethrower like
hi again they are two of my favorite
foiled eyeshadows by Michael peek just
because they are so stunning on the lid
like honestly I mix them together a lot
as well like I usually get my brush in
both and just sort of play around and
mix them all together but they're just
insane like they look so so beautiful
under lid especially unlike what we felt
on any eyes like blue eyes green eyes
brown eyes I feel like they do something
different for every eye color and then
right at the end of the row we have the
three eyeshadows I actually mentioned in
my chrome must-haves and obsessions
which was like maybe a couple videos but
I'll put it on the screen here in case
you missed it what we basically got
sidekick cocoa bear and cabin fever
which again is kind of like this three
above which was rough a bake sale on tan
lines you don't need all three of these
like I just have them in here because I
love my pounds ever you really don't
need all three they're very similar
they're just sort of like warm ready
toned like earthy Brown sidekick which
is the end one is the palest of the
three and I feel like if you know I
would say which one I use the most part
I honestly don't know because I used to
just sort of dip my brush in all of them
and what sidekick is the palest one and
it's more like an orangey Brown I would
say and then you've got cocoa Belle
which is like one of my oldest ones
again and it's just like a real rich
chocolate brown and then at the very end
is cabin fever which is a little bit
more like 30 I would say it's a little
bit deeper a bit darker and I just love
that one in the Afrikaner especially to
mix some of the bag and use at the
bottom and it's love all three of them
so much I wouldn't even know which one
to say if I was going to recommend one
because I really do just like get my
brush in all three but this area of
matte bronze it just makes me a happy
childhood Senate down onto the next row
we have a grandstand which is one of the
fold ones again actually does my nail
and that so it's got a must've a hole in
it and it's like a sort of topi satiny
moldy Goldy pinky oil - it's kind of
like a warm pinky taupe I would say
again it looks lovely on the lid I don't
use it tons because the olive oils I
shadowed I prefer and but yeah it would
look so lovely unlike brown eyes with a
couple of like purples in the crease and
things like that again it's just like a
in staple foiled eyeshadow just glide
beautifully applies beautifully and it's
a little bit more like yeah pinky Toby
so if you don't like anything as long as
the ones that I prefer which would like
swim through and like in and you would
probably prefer Graham stone which is
like not as warm and like market
pinky toe which I spent like five clinic
time we don't have roulette with again
I'm pretty sure I've got like no fingers
free swatch and more but I'm pretty sure
again roulette is one of the duo chrome
either way it's like a payload sort of
metallic wrap and it's just like yeah
quite a burn sort of orange red it's
like a shimmer as I said it's like an
Patel like I'm pretty sure it's a jewel
chrome again just looks lovely on the
lid and it's kind of similar to curtain
coal which is down here and also
flamethrower but because it's not up
world eyeshadow it's not like as
intensely shimmery so if you don't like
that and you don't like something to be
like too metallic and shimmery then I
would take or light inside which is like
a little bit it's like similar but a
tiny bit more toned down
we don't have show talent which is
another foiled eyeshadow they are just
impacted in this palette because I love
them so much it's more of like a
burgundy purple shade I would say it's
like a really beautiful deep sort of
purple very chalice love it honestly
like if you're the sort person who
prefers like darker colors on the lid
and you don't want anything as like
bright as what I usually wear then and
what was it called - the name has
escaped me sometimes sorry is such a
good option again it would look stunning
on blue green brown eyes because I feel
like it just does something different
for every eye color and yeah it would
look so stunning with like the burgundy
shades I'm going to go through it the
mini at the bottom like on the outer
corner and in the cream then we have it
steampunk which is definitely a dual
chrome because you can see when it hits
a light in the pan it looks brown but
then it's got like pink reflux to it I
would say so
yeah it's basically like a brown sort of
metallic eyeshadow but the reflex are
like ready pain yeah it really is like
looking ugly on it's a very interesting
eyeshadow very unique I love it it's
fast we then have it brown sugar and
marker which are these two towards the
end and they're quite similar except
brown sugar has like a little bit of
shimmer to it and mocha is completely ma
so brush brown sugar saris more like a
purpley Brown I would say and then
raucous a little bit more neutral and a
tiny bit cooler
I personally love both if I'm going to
reach one I usually reach for marker
because I like to use it in the outer
corner and obviously like it's my brows
okay even though it just have like a
tiny bit of glycerin I feel like you can
still use it in the outer corner and
stuff and it looks fine like it doesn't
look wrong or misplaced or like it
should be on lid or anything like guys
a lovely shimmer to use like in the
crease and on alpha D and stuff like
that as well then right at the very end
we have drama queen which is like a
metallic shimmery purple and it's kind
of like the only like true purple in
this palette I would say a housewife by
side the end but I just really like it
fit in so well because I do have a row
at the bottom which is like mostly
burgundy and I do love using Purple's on
my eyes so I felt like I just wanted to
squash it in at the end here again it's
one of her older shades now I feel like
I'm like I feel like I've had this a
while I just love it because it looks
like a true purple but it's not a flat
color because like whatever is in it
that reflex like pink it's like it
reflects light pink and red and it just
makes it really interesting like not as
I said like a flat color and then it
moving on to the very bottom row this is
more so like my Burgundy's and like
purple shades now so the first one is
vintage and it's kind of like a muted
purpley mold reminds me a lot of like
Foley by Marc I feel like back in the
day when I used to like use my Mac
palette 24/7 I reach mostly for Foley
which was like a really beautiful
I feel like melody I want to use again
somehow easier in so long it was like a
really beautiful muted pebbly more and
if you like this is very similar to that
we don't have a cherry cola which is
kind of a new one to me bicylist on the
website and I just loved it instantly it
reminds me a lot of bitten which is on
the other side a distant one here and
they are very similar I wouldn't say
that you need both if I was going to get
one or the other I would get bitten
because for some reason my cherry color
doesn't feel the same in the formula but
if I was going to get one or the other
of those I would say bitten because that
again is one of my most used colors in
this palette I loved it so much and then
in the middle is the left which is kind
of like a symbol of color it's pretty
much the same as cherry cola and bitten
but it's like a metallic it's not matte
which still the two are and then the
next thing along is the last photo so in
the palette and it's definitely my
favorite one it is called curtaincall
and it's just a beautiful
all true deep bloody radishes like so so
nein I can't even explain how much I
love it I use it in a Valentine's Day
tutorial it's like a date tonight look I
like all over the lid with some Reds in
the crease it is insane it is so strong
and then at the very end is americano
which I feel like these full here so we
got besan curtaincall americano and then
corrupt which is also which is the black
and these are like my favorite darker
eyeshadows in this palette because
americano is like a plum eat brown and
it's got like a sort of purpley plummet
onto it but it just looks so something
like in the outer corner but oh my god I
love it so much americano I would want
to understand recommend I think it's
come in and obviously the black next to
it it's just corrupt it's a great black
eyeshadow very very pigmented
I literally barely touch the pan when I
use a brush and it's so so intense like
you need the tiniest bit and but yeah
again I usually mix like corrupt and one
of like the Browns or something so I
don't like going to Hadi but if I was
going to recommend like 5 o'clock I
shadows in this palette I would have to
say creme brulee because it's most used
because it's like my go-to transition
transition and then I would say curtain
call if you're going to get a fire your
line and then all that - I would say
Beth in understand spot 3 and then one
of these and all those get two of those
I've got one of these and then the black
is corrupt because I just think all
together just so good but I loved the
look to be a super mall I love them all
so that was the full palette of all of
my makeup geek was warm I shadows I
really hope you will enjoy this video
and found it helpful especially for
those of you who've been one in this
video for a long time because I feel
like I've seen a good few people like
constantly tweeting me on Twitter asking
for this video and I finally got around
to doing it and it feels so good but
yeah I really hope you all enjoyed this
video give it a massive thumbs up if you
did let me know if you want to see the
cool color as well because I can go
through that one as well if you want me
to but yeah a little bit so much I wish
I could just give everyone one of these
pallets I feel like if I had a palliate
this will just be made one in like this
was so be my palette it's just like it
couldn't get only honestly if you are so
watching
