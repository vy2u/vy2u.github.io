to be a what I got for Christmas because
I'm pretty sure I film one of these
every single year since I started my
channel guys asking me to do another one
this year so I assume you enjoy watching
them maybe kind of yeah as you all know
Christmas is my favorite time of year
I'm filming this on the 30th which is
the day before New Year's Eve this is
actually going to be my last video of
the year which is crazy to think about
I'm just gonna hop straight in so okay I
want to show you something that moment
I've got me I'm Charlie and because
these are like so cute I'm obsessed so
I'll just do this in a random order I'm
kind of just gonna do this in a random
order I think so yeah the first thing
that I have just completely gravitated
towards because I'm obsessed with these
these are some PJ's that mom and dad and
Charlie got me as I just said and
they're from M&amp;amp;S I don't know if they
still sell them and because they're not
like super Christmasy but they might be
a Christmas thing I'm not entirely sure
they're just PJ bottoms in a PJ top and
they've got cuts all over them you guys
know I'm a cut lady like I'm gonna have
about 50 when I'm older me and mom all
the family we just love cats obviously
we have it too as well and so this is
what they look like up close I don't
know if you can really see they've just
got moons and stars and cuts all over
them I love like the vibe and the sort
of color it's all kind of like
watercolor and really mesh together
which I love I don't know how much they
wear because she obviously has taken the
tag off but I'm obsessed with these I
cannot wait to wear them I always love a
good pair of PJ bottoms I don't
necessarily wear them in bed if that
makes sense because I don't really like
to wear a lot of clothes in bed I feel a
bit claustrophobic but I love wearing
them around the house and before I go to
bed and stuff like that and these are
super soft so thanks to mom dad and
Charlie for those one thing that I asked
for every single year is candles because
I feel like there's such an easy present
to buy for people and as someone who is
a candle lover I feel like you can never
have it too many
so my auntie house proxy my auntie tom
my Uncle Tom and my auntie Jen actually
got me a set of lily flame candles which
I'm obsessed with these are such cute
candles so you can get them in a little
set I believe they do a Christmas set
like this as well and but this one
contains a party time fairy dust and
blush which fairy dust has a really
special place in my heart because it was
probably like the first kind
I ever fell in love with when I was
younger well I absolutely love the
packaging of these and the candles
themselves are really good quality as
well they've burn really nicely it smell
amazing so again thank you so much to
Tom and Jennifer getting me those they
will definitely be getting burned very
quickly
she looks so unimpressed it's okay okay
yeah back onto something at that moment
dad and Charlie got me again this is a
from Swarovski and my mom especially
collects Swarovski kind of little
ornaments and stuff she's obsessed with
them so she went and bought me my very
first one because I do not own any of
these and again it is very appropriately
picked because it's actually a little
kitty cat with a Santa hat on that is
what he looks like there he's so super
cute I don't know where we're gonna put
him yet we might put him with like the
rest of the ones that mom's got because
mom's got all sorts of different animals
like fish and like lions and also mom
also got me some stuff from New York as
well last thing we've got is just a set
of journals because I feel like it's
always super handy to have like really
tiny little journals just to point you
back or just to have it in like the side
drawer are you bad or wherever you want
to pop them so that is what these ones
look like they just have this Statue of
Liberty and say I Love New York and then
there's one more there and then one in
the middle like I said there's three
mini ones which I'm just in love with I
think it's super cute and then she also
picked out this for me which she
actually got framed which is the cutest
thing ever she actually got it in a
frame that kind of matches all the
frames in my room as well it's just like
thin black so that is what the print
looks like I'm not entirely sure why she
got this wrong I think it was just like
a little market and but it's got a
little girl with the balloons and then
all the buildings behind and it says
once upon a time in New York City which
I absolutely love again it's very me
something that I can keep like I love
stuff like that for Christmas it's like
super special okay Charlie did really
well this year he picked out some really
fun gifts to me which I absolutely love
so the first one is from lush so this is
the Merry Christmas that you actually
wrote in the little tag as well which is
super cute and he knows how much I love
lush and bath bombs and things like that
so this was just like a winner straight
away so it has a shoot for the stars a
Christmas sweater
thundersnow and Golden Wonder which are
all Christmas exclusive bath bombs I
don't know if Lucius
still got and Christmas like collections
in stock because I feel like this
sometimes have a little bit like a
little bit extra struck after Christmas
if that makes sense but yeah I'm
obsessed with that absolutely love it so
thank you Charlie and then you also
picked out a t-shirt for me which I'm
absolutely in love with so this is
actually from the fancy Puma range
because anyone who knows me and knows
that I love the offensive Puma range I
just feel like they always have it super
fab pieces so this is just a black top
and all the new range is kind of like
Frenchy University I believe so it's
just a black top and then it's got the
little Lobos and the extra big logo on
the back that this is in a size 8 as
well which is like an extra small u.s.
the one thing that I love about Fancy
Pumas stuff is the quality of the
clothes and stuff is just so good like I
have had things I've had my sliders from
the first collection for like God knows
how long I've had the zip up Hoodie that
I always wear for god knows how long and
it just lasts so well unto something
that my Nana and Gramps got me they got
me a little GHD set because I always
need stuff to help with my hair so the
packaging of course is super cute very
Christmasy and then it just has a little
product inside as you can see and this
is the DHD advance split and therapy
which is so funny because my Nana rang
me later and she was like please don't
think I'm trying to imply that you have
split and even though I do I desperately
need it but I'm really excited to give
this a go she said the people at the
salon where she goes to really recommend
it so hopefully it will help my little
hair they also got me Oreos which anyone
who gets new food at Christmastime just
has a special place in my heart
so these are just the normal Oreos I
literally live off Oreos and I did
especially in like September October
time when I was really strict on being
vegan because for anyone who does not
know Oreos are vegan they're probably
one of the only yummy chocolates that I
like that you can get really easily that
are vegan which is really cool so they
very kindly got me some of those because
again I need a constant supply okay
vegans hard I'm not gonna lie I'm not
really stuck to it now if I'm being
completely honest and I have said this
on Twitter as well I've not really stuck
to it since we had the kitchen done and
I want to really go back into being
quite disciplined with it in the new
year so
we'll help me out okay we have this
little guy this was the first thing I
opened this is from my cousin's Ben and
Jack I believe they actually made this
which it's just the cutest thing ever
I'm gonna keep this jar I don't know
what I'm gonna put in it yet I'm just
obsessed with it it's basically like a
little reindeer I think it's like a baby
Rudolph
it does have Maltesers in it which I've
not eaten yet I feel like I will they
will get nibbled at some point but yeah
I just thought this was so cute I love
things like this things that you can
keep and then use for other things and
put other things in and whatnot I'm just
obsessed it's so cute it's so dinky okay
we've got two more lily flame candles so
this one they're actually the same but
this one is from my mom and this one is
from my auntie Elaine so this is the
over the moon candle which was from my
auntie Elaine I'm absolutely obsessed it
smells really fresh like it kind of
smells like oh I can't describe it it's
kind of like reminds me of the beach I
don't know if that makes sense so
anything that is moon related or star
related I always loved as gifts oh thank
you so much - Elaine for that and of
course - mom for the big one I got a
bunch of a cozy socks so I'm pretty sure
these were from Tom and Jen and then I'm
pretty sure I got some from Nana and
grants which I don't know if these are
either of them and then some are from
mom and dad as well because again at
cozy socks I just need a constant supply
of cozy socks okay I live in them all
the time I've got PJs on right now with
cut ones aren't they're just my favorite
things ever but because I wear them so
much they got really scraggly and by the
time it comes to questions again and I
just asked the tons and tons of socks
because I need a fresh start so we've
got these ones from fat-faced which just
have Rudolph's and some white ones with
red spots on and then we've got some
from M&amp;amp;S which I kind of like trainer
socks they're like slipper socks and
these have just got stars and little
pom-poms on and then we've also got
these ones from Jules which are fluffy
Christmas socks and just have penguins
on so again in love with those from my
Nana and granddad I first off got a
candle again always need a good candle
so this is a Yankee candle and again I
love Yankee Candles I feel like Molton
Brown John Malone Yankee Candle and
Lilly flame are my favorite brands and
then it's go with it they got me a
little llanto which he basically
attached to the candle I'm not going
make it up now because I'll probably
drop it and make a massive mess but this
is basically the base and then you put
the candle on the tray and then put that
on top of the candle it makes a little
lump which I love and I love that it's
kind of like a neutral color as well
because it'll go really well in my room
I got a couple of mini clutches and bags
so this first one is from cousin Steve
which are family and friends which when
I open this I've just fell in love it is
stunning so it's kind of like this more
the pinky velvet as you can see and then
I don't know if you can see at the
bottom but it's got like a tiny little
dragonfly I think is so it's by a brand
called okra which is about like oh you
asked HK a I don't have heard of the
brand before I feel like it brings about
I'm gonna have to go on the website and
check but either way I love the size of
it I love the actual style at the back
as well because I feel like you could
use this for so many different things it
pretty much is a clutch but you could
also use it as like a mini makeup bag or
just to store kind of mini necessities
when you travel and things like that so
I'm absolutely in love with this thank
you so much to cousin Steve then this
last one is from Cathy Peddie
Holly and Rory which I like our Irish
family so this is like a little black
mini makeup bag this one's more of a
makeup bag I would say oh I would use it
for more of makeup bags it just kind of
fits it's like the right size for a set
of brushes or something like that and
with the leather it's easier to clean
compared to like the velvet so this
one's by a brand called Katy Loxton
London which again I don't know if I've
heard of but I'm gonna have to look into
and it's just a black kind of leather
clutch mini back and then on the front
and gold right in it says hey beautiful
I don't know if you can see that I have
to kind of block my face like make sure
the camera focus is so again I
absolutely love this I always need a
top-up of makeup bugs and things like
that as well because mine gets so grubby
from traveling and things that I like to
sort of clear them out and then get new
ones I don't even know if I want to use
this to make books it's so pretty I'm
like I don't a rune it also from Nana
and Gramps I got a new a black leather
rucksack because I did actually ask for
one of these because I have a really
small rucksack that's from I want to say
it's from skinny-dip but I'm not
entirely sure I'll leave it in the
description bar below with everything
else and I absolutely love it but it's
just a little bit too small like it
the right amount for kind of day-to-day
stuff but I wanted one that I could take
on overnight stays and things like that
so this one is from a sauce so it's by a
brand called pieces and as you can see
it's just a plain a black leather
rucksack which is perfect for me because
I wear black all the time and it goes
with everything what I also love is the
fact that when you open it up actually
has red interior which for me it makes
it look like it's Louboutin do you know
I mean I'll have that I'll take it okay
and then on to you a couple of bigger
things that mom and dad Charlie very
kindly bought me for Christmas which I
was blown away by they completely spoilt
me this year it's crazy so the first
thing is something that I've wanted for
ages and ages and ages ever since I put
these on I think I tried them in John
Lewis ever since then I've just been
obsessed and just been something that's
been on my wish list that I've never got
around to by myself so these are a pair
of headphones one thing that really bugs
me about having an iPhone 7 which is
just the biggest first of all problem of
life like who starts a complaint with
you know having an iPhone 7 yeah one of
the things that really annoys me about
an iPhone 7 is that you can't charge it
and listen to music at the same time
unless you have Bluetooth headphones
because obviously the headphones are
like the air phones is also a lightning
cable now which sounds like a really
weird thing but because I got the train
and stuff a lot I often need to charge
my phone but also when I listen to music
at the same time it's a massive personal
problem I know okay but either way I
wanted some bluetooth headphones for
ages and like I said when I tried these
in John Lewis they are so good guys okay
so these are by Bose they are quiet
comfort 35 the second edition so 35
number two noise cancelling headphones
again also for flights because I don't
know if it's just like the flights that
I get but for some reason they're always
so noisy
I don't know what it is but everything
around me just feels really noisy and it
really books me when I want to get sleep
yeah these are noise cancelling and
trust me as soon as you put them on you
cannot hear anything about what these
feet what these headphones are playing
which is amazing the actual sound
quality as well is insane like they're
just the minute I put a song on it just
blew me away by how good the sound
quality was so ever since have been
obsessed with them I'm mom dad and
Charlie very kindly got me them for
Christmas which I was super excited
about when I open these I was just like
blown away because they're not cheap and
they're not cheap headphones and like I
said they really did spoil me so I was
super grateful for those
and then next thing is from YSL or Saint
Laurent so this is a little card holder
because for the longest time now I have
not had a proper purse and it kind of
occurred to me the reason I don't have a
proper purse is that I hate having bulky
things in my bag like I don't like to
take really big bucks out and so I don't
like to have a purse that takes up lots
of room in my small bag as if you know I
mean Plus that just like a bow legs he
got out when you paying for something
that I tell I feel like because my hands
are tiny as well like I cannot be
dealing with chunky purses so when I was
shopping for sort of like a purse thing
I came across card holders and I was
like you know what that is a bit of me
okay so this one is by YSL I'm
absolutely in love with this I saw it
online and I've not seen it like in
person and then the minute I opened it I
was like wow that is just what I needed
that's all I needed so it just looks
like so it's kind of quilted as you can
see and it can fit one two three foot
well it has four slots but obviously you
could put like two cars in one slot or
whatever and it's just dinky and it's
just what I need because like I said big
chunky purses I used to like them but as
time went on I was like you know what
there's no need for them because I only
have a couple of cards anyway and I
don't usually carry around cash with me
so this for me is perfect I'm in love
with it so again thank you so much to
mom dad and Charlie for that because
they've really spoilt me with these
things like honestly the last thing they
got me it was from Pandora which I was
like guys I didn't need all this stuff
you didn't spend as much money but I'm
so grateful for this because I'm
absolutely in love with it
the special thing about this as well as
I kind of gave them an idea like my mom
and dad I kind of gave them an idea of
what I wanted from the store but they
sort of picked it themselves which makes
it even more special so if anyone's seen
Pandora have collaborated with Disney
and brought out a kind of Disney
collection so they've got Disney charms
necklaces so mum knows that I'm very
picky with jewelry this is why I don't
really have a charm bracelet or anything
like that because I don't really like to
wear anything super heavy on my wrist I
very rarely wear necklaces like I'm just
really picky about what I like to wear
which probably sounds a bit silly and I
just don't like to have too much on me
it makes me feel a bit claustrophobic
I don't know so they did to pick out a
bracelet for me but they just got one
little charm to go on it which is
absolutely perfect
for me it's basically a kind of rose
gold I would say which is perfect again
because you guys know I love it rose
gold and gold but not so much silver so
that is the bracelet there so that's the
clasp and then it's got to stop is and
the charm will sit at the bottom in the
middle I've not tried it on yet because
like I said I've not got any of this owl
and then the actual charm is from the
Disney collection so the charm itself is
silver which mom was like if you don't
like the fact that it's kind of silver
and then the bracelets rose gold and
obviously feel free to change it and but
I do really love it and obviously like I
said I love that they picked it out for
me so the actual charm just looks like
so I don't know if you're gonna be able
to see yeah you can kind of see that so
it's a tiny little crown which I'm just
obsessed with it's so freakin cute I
can't wait to put this on like money
said I can't wait to put this on I'm not
like I said I'm not the sort of person
that wears your jewelry a lot get my
weight out but for like special
occasions and stuff I just I'm just as
like a keepsake as well like these are
the things that I just really love so
I'm not gonna put him on I might like
take a picture though when I've actually
had my nails done and put it on
Instagram or something but honestly mom
and dad nailed it they absolutely nailed
it okay so yeah mom Doug and Charlie
actually spoiled me which I did not
expect but I'm obviously super grateful
for so thank you so much I hope you guys
let your Christmas presents as well is
there anything else I want to share with
you oh I will quickly show you what cane
got me of course
okay so cane actually got me something
from Pandora as well which when I opened
it I just fell in love it's absolutely
stunning so he actually got me a little
ring which it's a shame that I've not
got nice nails because I feel like rings
just don't look good on my fingers
unless I've got nails on so that is what
it looks like that it's kind of just a
little tear drop shape which I
absolutely love because I have two or
three rings from Pandora I would say and
I don't have anything like this okay so
that is what it looks like that on - the
ugly nails so honestly I am obsessed
like I said I love dainty jewelry it's
my favorite type because it just feels
really pretty but not like it's too much
if you know I mean you did good you did
good guys and then he also got me some
socks which is a shame that this box is
ruined because the box is kind of what
makes it special I do have a new bar
because the people that you ordered it
from very kindly sent another one but I
don't know where it is so this was from
toffee which if you don't know your
tough year's toffee is canes dog she's
like the cutest little pop ever so that
is the box they're basically cane said
that you spilt something on it and then
tried to wipe it off which is wiped away
so it just says honey got your socks on
it and take me for walkies at love from
toffee which I just think is so cute and
it's basically just like a personalized
present and then it just has a bunch of
socks in side he got me some lip balms
as well these I believe are on a sauce
that actually Beauty and the Beast
Edition so we've got a little chip and
mrs. Potts I'm gonna up and I mean
it knows how much I love beating the
beast I actually made him sit and watch
it with me once again these are the
sorts of things that I'll use and then
keep the little containers I don't know
what for maybe for like a little stone
earrings or something but I'm obsessed
with totes as well I just think they're
super cute
it also got me a cute little phone case
which has me cane and toffee on which
I'm obsessed with it's been on my phone
ever since and then it got me a little
cleaning kit for my camera because one
thing that I always used to moan I'm
four will not learn at him but mom to
him if you know what I mean was that my
camera was always dirty because I lose
lens caps like no tomorrow like honestly
I don't know what it is but my lens caps
genuinely grow legs and just stop
walking and leave so this is just a
little cleaning kit which again is so
bloody thoughtful of him and it just has
like cloths and cleanses and stuff like
that which is actually just what I need
because my camera's are constantly
filthy but yeah I think that's
everything for this video like I said
this will be my last video of 2017 which
is crazy and it's definitely been an
interesting year I think I'm gonna do
like an uncut chat like I did like I
usually do each December and to kind of
sum up how I feel about the year it's
definitely been an interesting year not
one of my favorites um but it's been
it's been a mix of things yeah thank you
so much for all that be support this
year it's men at the absolute world to
me
hopefully 2018 will be even bigger even
better but yeah I'm gonna get going
anyway because my auntie Jenn and Uncle
Tom I've just got around so I'm gonna go
down as they hide to them but thank you
so much for watching I love you guys
muna back at million times over of
course I hope you and your families and
your friends and whoever you spent
Christmas with had a wonderful time
love you and I'll see you next year no
jokes honestly I love you on SPT soon
