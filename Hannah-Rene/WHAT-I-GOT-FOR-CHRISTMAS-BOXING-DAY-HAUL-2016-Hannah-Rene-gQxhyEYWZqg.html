a what I got for Christmas and a boxing
day sale haul because I did one of these
lashing and all of you seem to love it
and personally I love watching these
videos as well because I love being
nosey and seeing what everyone else got
for Christmas as well I hope you all had
an amazing Christmas I can't actually
believe it's over like I did not feel
Christmasy at all this year and then
when it finally got to Christmas Eve I
felt so festive and then it was such
just gone like and done like that and I
was so annoyed but yeah I hope you all
had a wonderful day and a wonderful
Boxing Day and I hope you're all excited
for New Year's Eve as well let me know
in the comments what plans you have
because I would love to know I do have a
tutorial going off on Thursday as well
for like a New Year's Eve look you're
liking when I sneeze but dress much the
wings did I smudge them no we're all
good also I'm sorry my neck and my hands
look really dark compares my face I pop
fake tan on but then I realized I wanted
to film this video so it's still
developing quicker than like obviously
the foundation on my face looks so don't
mind me honestly like this I basically
got like a load of a little bit this
year like there was no sort of main
present if you like I'm just because I
didn't really ask for anything so I feel
like everything that I got is just like
little bits okay so all this first lot
of stuff were things that were in my
stocking so they're basically from mom
and dad and Santa obviously the first
thing is to really cute little and
glasses
I actually saw these in Urban Outfitters
not so long ago and I pointed the Martin
mom and I'm pretty sure we like bought
them there and then but she was like
I'll save them for Christmas and I did
forget about them like just anyone else
do that you pick a present out and then
you're like it gets bought but then when
it gets to Christmas Day you open it you
completely forgot about it's like a
surprise all over again it's the best
thing ever so yeah these are two little
glasses one of them it says meow and
it's got little whiskers and then the
other one has a black cat and imprint
and then it's got gold whiskers as well
I'm not entirely sure how much these
were but like I said they were in Urban
Outfitters the reason that is a couple
of home bits in this video as well is
because I'm actually hoping to move out
at the start of 2017 and I feel like
I've kept that a secret for so long like
it's been something that we've been
trying to sort out since about September
time and I do sort of know where it is
that I want to move to like what sort of
like what apartment I guess what will
haven't
of issues with the person who's like in
the apartment at the minute which is why
it's taking so long to go through and
why I'm not said anything about it on
like social media or in videos yet but
that is why there's going to be some
home stuff in this I'm so excited I'm
just hoping that it works out that's why
I'm not said because we don't really
know if it's going to like fall through
over it's going to work out yeah but
that is why there's some home bits
because I'm hopefully moving out soon
and then next up and I absolutely love
this again this is something that mum
picked out for me and this is from Emma
Bridgewater and if you guys know me and
you watch my like get ready with me
you'll know that I love and I'm average
wore some marks so she actually got this
it's a tiny little mug it's actually the
same mug as the one that's mine it's got
like love hearts all over it and but
it's a tiny little one and it's actually
a Christmas decoration which is why it's
got a little ribbon and so she basically
bought this for me for next year when I
have my first Christmas tree which is so
exciting like I just want it to be
Christmas all over again now so I can
pop this on my tree and yeah thank you
so mom for picking this out for me
because I absolutely love it mom also
picked out something from Hard Rock Cafe
for me this is one of their holiday
ornaments and for 2016 it's basically a
little and again sort of like a
Christmas ornament which I can use next
year which will be really cute it's just
a blue it's like an icy blue guitar and
with snowflakes on it it says Hard Rock
Cafe Manchester and she picked this out
because some of you might know this but
back in it must have been like 2012 I
want to say or maybe like 2013 and I
actually wanted tickets to go meet
Taylor Swift at the Hard Rock Cafe and
we had like a dinner there and I got to
meet her and she signed my guitar and it
was so much fun and someone basically
got this because it reminded her of that
day like it's one of my favorite days
ever
and I love it like I'll just always look
at this and think of that now so again
thank you to mama and then I got another
cut calendar because I get one of these
every single year and my stocking and
I'm just because I always have it on my
bedside table there this is like the cat
naps when it's just a little desk one
that pops out and it's got loads of
different kitty cats throughout the
different rocks which apps let's love
and but yeah I get that every single
year I love it and then I also got a
part of fleecy and like PJs shorts I
love the feel of these I wish you guys
could like feel these through the screen
because they're so soft and I believe
they're from next yet the front necks
and they're just little yellow shorts
and they're called foxes and pretty sure
the foxes yet we've got foxes a hole
over there and I love things like this
because anyone who knows me it knows
that like I cannot sleep if PJ buttons
you will never see me unless I'm on the
house you'll never see me in a pair of
PG buttons because I can't stand feeling
claustrophobic in bed I don't know if
that make sense but I just I don't like
wearing a lot of clothes when I go to
sleep and so things like shorts and
little desktops are perfect for me and I
absolutely love these so again thank you
so much to mom and dad and then I also
want the cutest socks honestly I swear
to only gets so excited about getting
fluffy socks every single Christmas and
but these are just gray and they've got
a little castle they let me show you it
wants to follow my face
hello oh my gosh look how cute they are
they've got little pom-poms for the ears
are like pink and then they've got a
little cutscene so these are from M&amp;amp;S
they are they're super soft bed socks
and I'm telling right now they are
bloody soft like they feel so good and
but yeah I look at em fluffy socks every
single year because I feel like I just
go through them like wildfire
like I just wear them every single day
around the house because I hate having
cold feet so again I love them thank you
so much to mom and dad and Santa
obviously I got one of the lily flame
candles this is in the scent winter wood
and it's just a little purple and it's
like one of the mini versions it smells
really good like but I can't pipe pot
might like finger on how I would
describe it because it's not
particularly woody in my opinion it's
quite like um like if you imagine like
baby baby powder or something like that
I don't know it's not like sweet it's
like a cross between like sweetness and
like freshness but it smells a lot like
baby powder I don't have that's just me
and I absolutely love it and like I said
if you know me you know that I love it
Lily flame candles because they're so
good for the money but they really do
like the Sun burn straight away like I
hate some scented candles that you spend
so much money on and the scent just sort
of like doesn't even fill the room but I
swear to God the minute I like these
like I can just smell it and I
love it and then I got another set of
lily flame candles because I actually
pointed these out to mom I went to try
and bite them on Christmas Eve myself
because I was scared that they were out
of stock mm-hmm and they were actually
out of stock when I went on Christmas
Eve so when I opened them on Christmas
Day I was so happy these are like the
Christmas and trio ones so there's one
called Christmas Eve one called Merry
Christmas and then one called Christmas
Day it's like red golden navy and like I
said as Mellie's in the shop and they
are so nice like I just love the smell
of them so much especially Merry
Christmas like this one's my favorite
and so if you can still get your hands
on these honestly try to I know they do
them in John Lewis and they do them at
Amazon I believe and but they're so
worth the money and like I said they're
really inexpensive oh my gosh okay we've
got my fill I got a bit too excited that
we've got my favorite candle of all for
a game at time this is honestly like I
feel like mom just gets me one of these
a year now because they're very
expensive so I don't like spending tons
of money on them like on this brand
because it is very expensive but me and
mom as such a sucker for it and so this
is by the brand mods molten Brown sorry
and if you watch my what I got for
Christmas last year I'm pretty sure I
showed this as well because I did get
one last year so yeah this is the molten
Brown at candle in Imps whisper and it
comes in this little lilac purple jar oh
it smells so good because it smells like
men like it just smells like a mine I
kinda I just looked stuff like that like
a ball of Joe Mellon sent recently that
sometimes when you spray it it smells
quite like masculine and I love it
sounds like that I don't know what it is
it's like if a guy walks past me in the
chute and he smells got him just like
but honestly if you have a chance go and
smell this in a shop because it's just
so like different to any other candle
that I have any other scented candle and
again it really does like fill the room
like the minute you like this after go
ten minutes you can really smell it in
the room and I absolutely love that so I
feel like I'm gonna wait until I've
moved out fingers crossed if all goes
well and I think I'm gonna wait until
I've moved out and save this for my new
flat and this will be my first candle in
that because it's just my favorite one
ever I absolutely love it okay we've got
two little note pads from John Lewis and
I did actually ask for these because I
saw them on the website and I
absolutely fell in love with them and
these are by a brand called portico
designs I try to link them down below if
I can and but basically there is one
that had every letter on it so I got one
with H on it they were all different
colors as well so it's really cool and
this one is just get get girl this one
is gray and it's got a gold sort of
emboss like H on air I don't know if you
can like see the cameras I'm not gonna
want to pick this up because it's
following my face
there we go yeah so it's just like grey
and it's got em it's like a cross out
and then it's got a gold sheet behind it
obviously you can see what I mean then I
also got one in my star sign as well
because they do these and everyone's
star sign I am a Leo and I love being a
Leo let me know in the comments who else
is a Leo as well because we also just
like my favorite people ever Leo's and
contest the leo one is a sort of bright
blue like teal color and then again it's
got like a copper um it's like embossed
and like white and it's got a copper
sort of like lion head and then it just
says leo at the bottom absolutely love
these I got Rylan down below if icon and
in the papers like gold as well I just
think they're so cute and obviously like
personal as well because they've got
either your letter or your arm like your
initial or your star sign so yeah
absolutely love these and I shall put
them you on below the packing cries I
got a couple of different bits from by
allegory because I if you have a one
good makeup storage I feel like by
allegory by allegory I think at Isaiah
and they do a really good makeup storage
and you can get them on Amazon and for
like a relatively good price I would say
it's basically acrylic storage and so I
got a couple of these from mom and dad
and then I also got some from my second
family in Ireland which is Kathy patty
Rory and Ollie so yeah they're just
clear acrylic containers like this I'll
link them down below and there's a bunch
of different ones this is just the
powder one site for blushes in compacts
and I have a bunch of these for my lip
glosses and also for my lipsticks as
well they're just really handy really
sturdy they do them in a bunch of
different styles and see ya thank you to
Cathy Peddie Holly and Rory for all of
those
my mom as well again in my stocking I
got the laura geller lip strip and
smoothing scrub sugar scrub I basically
asked for a sugar scrub and a lip
conditioner for Christmas because my god
when I say my lips are dry my lips are
like flaky as
so yeah this is by Laura Geller and I
pop this on my sort of like questions
list like I made a really smaller just
because I had really good reviews and
yeah like I said it's just a smoothing
sugar scrub and it just looks like this
in the little container so gonna give
this a go just because I really have
never had like a good lip scrub or maybe
I'm just not like sort of invested in
one or took the time to try one out I'm
gonna give this one a go and hopefully
it will work because I swear to God
putting on a liquid lipstick it's just
like so grim and then we've also got a
ultra nourishing lip balm and this is by
a brand called nooks I want to say it's
like nu x e I've been like trying their
skink I recently just because I got a
lot of like samples and excuse me yeah
I've been trying to skin dry recently
and I'm really impressed like their
facial exfoliator which I might say for
a favorites video and then also and
they're sort of melting cleanser I
really enjoy using in the bath and again
this one had really good and reviews on
the website so it just comes in a little
pot like so it just says it's an ultra
nourishing lip balm so again I'm going
to give this a go just because if you
like stuff like Vaseline even though
it's sort of like moisturizes my lips at
the time I'm pretty sure long-term it
dries them out more and but yeah I'm
going to give that a go and hopefully it
will do a job then this next gift is
probably my favorite gift in this whole
video like when I open this I just loved
it so more so this is from my mother and
this is by again I'm a bridgewater
because as I said you guys know we love
that bronze okay so she got me a mug
which I already love the mugs as it is
but then if that wasn't good enough
it's got my friggin it name on it and
you're not gonna be able to see them
back here but it's basically a white mug
and then it's got bread reindeer on like
sort of prancing around if you like and
then it's just got a green text that
says honey Renee and I just love that so
much I didn't even know that you get
these personalized it's even got a
little app the little accent
in all and yeah I had no idea that you
could get these personalized because I
actually got my mom some of these for
Christmas anyway like the other
Christmas sort of edition like visions
of the morgue I just loved it like
honestly I feel like I might save this
to my flat as well just because I won't
even want to use this like it's just to
Percy to even use and I just thought
that was so thoughtful I had no idea but
you can get them personalized and little
things like that I like my favorite kind
of presents just because I think that
the sort of extra bit of thought went
into my gas and I just love that my mom
got me that so thank you so much my mom
because Allen felt I'm probably never
going to drink from a pitcher veges
little bit so much okay this again I'm
frigging obsessed with why is it dis see
how did that happen yeah oh my god I put
this on my list and it was the first
present I open like the first thing my
stocking and it's basically just a big
sippy cup and it's a pink cup and it
says love potion on it and then it's got
a right straw that's got redneck hearts
on and out the back it says instant
crush inducing new improved formula
which I just think is so much fun and
it's a really good size as well like
it's bigger I'm pretty sure than my
Starbucks one that's over there and and
I love things like this just because I
love having one of these like on my desk
when I'm getting ready just to make sure
that I'm drinking enough water I love
putting like juice in there and stuff
like that and this is by a brand called
bun dough so I'll link it down below if
I can but just the whole like Brendan
like the style of it I absolutely love
like I think it's really like playful
and fun um so that is that okay and then
these next things is really funny
because mum got me one because I picked
it out and open Outfitters but then
Charlie actually bought me one as well
so I have it too and these are the sort
of what you even call these like the LED
light boxes that you can sort of put
text on and just because I'm seeing
these everywhere the minute and I love
them so much again I wanted one and to
my flat when I move out just to put like
in the background of one of my videos or
like support um where like my filming
area is going to be a gas via it's just
a little light-up box and you can put
different tacks on it and just customize
it how you want and then it lights up
and it looks really cool so I've got one
here which is by a bronze what brand is
this cinema lightbox I don't know
there's also one here by gingersnap
which is basically the exact same thing
so it's pretty hardly like having that
extra letters anyway in case I'd like
don't have enough letters for one but
then cute small and Charlie you're
obviously both know me really well to
think to get me to and I feel like I
keep one at home and have one when I
move out so that will be really fun my
auntie mag and see what Ben and Jack got
me some alcohol they clearly know the
way to my heart and very kindly gave me
a little bit money to spend on boxing a
and then also gave me some Prosecco as
well I believe this is but yeah honestly
money and alcohol what more does a girl
need nothing and where's my aunty
Elaine's gift because that was really
cute yeah my aunty Ling got me to a
really cute little bit so again we've
got a little bathroom which looks like
so this isn't from lush is from a
company called balm cosmetics which I
actually haven't heard of before but it
smells really good it smells like
straight-up oranges and I love like
citrusy sense I feel like they're really
fresh like they're really good in the
morning when you want to wake yourself
up and but yeah it just looks like so I
might have to check this company out
because I don't like I'm not heard of it
before like I said it's called balm
cosmetics but it smells really good and
then we've also got a little dinky
earring holder it's kind of hard to see
and but it's like a sort of transparent
glass and then it's got a white love
heart in the center just to pop on like
the top of my chest of drawers and to
put like earrings and jewelry in which I
love because I do have a couple of other
bits like this as well and I always love
having little dinky dishes and my chest
of drawers so thank you to Elaine for
those really cute little goody okay and
then this one is really funny because my
dad always gets me really practical
gifts but no joke I was sat in the car
on Christmas Eve and I've just got an
iPhone 7 plus and I swear to god it's
friggin huge they're the only reason I
got the plus is because it had a way
best back than the actual like the
smaller normal iPhone 7 and it doesn't
fit in my car it doesn't fit like in my
mini and like the cup holder anymore I
used to put my phone in there and like
play music from it or whatever or like
have the sat-nav on there yeah I know my
iPhone 7 doesn't fit in the cup holder
of my car anymore which is so annoying I
have to just put it in the side and then
I can't really like see it if I've got
the sat-nav on or like I forget to pick
it up out of my car and I was actually
it sat in the car
on Christmas Eve wishing that I had one
of those things that you can sort of
attach to UM heater or like part of the
cart and then you can clip it into your
phone and open this from my dad and I
was like thank the Lord so this is
exactly that it is a three in one car
holder and you can basically like attach
it to different parts of your car and
then pop your phone in which is so handy
for me because honestly like I needed
one of these and I was like I really
want someone to get me one because I
need one so badly and my dad read my
mind
so thanks that because that will
definitely come in super useful and then
he also got this something really cool
of a film in like honestly my dad always
thinks of gifts that I would never sort
of like think to by myself but I would
just hope that I get if that makes sense
so this is basically a steady calm a
couple of you might have seen these if
you do like filming yourself or if you
know people that do film in and it's
basically a way like you attach a camera
I have no idea how it works out but you
attach your camera at the top and then
you sort of also the weights and stuff
and it helps it keep your camera steady
and then you can just hold it here and
sort of move it around and it helps to
keep the camera balanced and steady it's
really good for things like look books
or say if I wanted to do a room tour or
like a flat tour maybe at some point
anything like that like it's really good
to like puppey camera on and then you
can just sort of move your hand and you
don't have to worry about like you
camera and your footage be and really
like not stabilize and because this just
keeps it balanced for you so thank you
so much to dad I can't wait to start
playing with this because I really do
want to do I really do want to start
doing more sort of a lot books and
videos well like the film and it's just
like extra on point so that will
definitely come in handy then I have no
idea how to use it yet as you can
probably tell well practice makes
perfect moment dad also got me something
from Swarovski as well because my mom
has such a crazy collection of like a
little ornaments and like the figures
that you can get from Swap Swarovski she
loves them so much and so again she got
me something to go in my new home when I
finally he fingers crossed can move in
dough again because she knows I love it
scented candles and like tea lights and
stuff like that she basically got me a
mini M it's like a tea light holder but
it's got its light encrusted all around
without Swarovski I find it so hard to
say that word rawski I'm crystals which
I absolutely love and then it's got
just got a little transparent bottom I
shall show you up close yeah that's what
it looks like now as you can see like
when it hits the light it's just so
pretty I'm absolutely obsessed so thank
you so much my mom I felt like it was
only right one day that she got me
something herself from Swarovski because
like I said she had such a crazy
collection in the living room like it's
a burger oh Henry show that's like
Narron off everything I got
that's like everything that's on the
floor that I brought up anyway so I'll
move on to the stuff that I got in the
Boxing Day sales
I actually got quite a lot of stuff that
I've not picked up yet which is kind of
annoying I got a new bag and from
salvages I got a black guy go back
because I've been in need so long with
like a new handbag I really want to say
for like as you bunchy one because I've
seen as you raunchy one which I
absolutely love but I just don't I don't
want to splurge some money on it at the
minute if I'm going to be moving out so
I just got it quick I go on instead
because it is about 160 pounds in the
sale so it's like a fraction at the
price and I also got some of the
soft-serve I should have buy Mac because
those are on sale which is really cool
and some of the pro longwear waterproof
and I pencils as well because they were
also on offer for like 11 pounds or so
first leg app ome mom honestly like my
main present was going to be some
bedding that I really really want for my
new place and it's by a brand called
Harlequin I want to say I'll link it
down below it's so pretty but it was
very expensive so mum basically said
like she wanted to wait and see if it
went in the sales because the throw in
particular I think it was like 200
pounds or something crazy like that just
for a bad throw and so we waited until
Boxing Day and luckily it went into the
sale so we picked that up as well
and but I'll link it down below if you
want to know what it looks like and you
wanna get it yourself I have no idea if
it's sling stop they stop at paint and
Victoria's Secret on Christmas Eve
though just because they always thought
that I'm Christmas sale my has really
annoy me I always seem to start their
sales on Christmas Eve so I always go in
and see what's on offer because I
usually have it really good stuff and so
first off from the Victoria's Secret I
don't know this is bits here my but I'm
just going to show you a no because okay
I got a great bra actually matches kind
of oh my gosh I forgot to show you what
my 9 and grandpa got me okay so the
first thing I
like held this up to myself and then I
realized what my Nana and Grandpa bought
me
they actually got me this jumper as one
thing and this was from Urban Outfitters
and again I picked it out at the same
time and then forgot about it which was
really cool like a fleecy jumper I don't
think it'll still be in sup in stock
because I'm pretty sure it is in the
sale then they also got me the cutest
PJs ever which I wore throughout the
whole of yesterday and use it like so
soft and it's like a PJ top and it's got
a hood with fur around it and then it's
got a little Christmas Robin and it says
tweet dreams which i think is so cute
and then it's got matching red bottoms
as well so thank you to that grandpa for
those because I know you guys watch my
videos which is like where the hue I'm
sorry that I almost forgot to show those
is because the down there in a pile
because they like need to be washed
because I wore them yesterday and they
like the confuse things a but I did not
get dressed all day as I was saying I
got a bra and these are some of my
favorite bras some of its very secret
they're like I don't know the style of
them is called like this isn't an exact
one that I have but they have they're
like a really soft material and then
they've got this really pretty lace trim
all around the inside of like the cop
and up strap and then I've got a little
bow and also a little vyas logo as well
this is just a gray one with pink and
lace and I do have one that's why no I
have one that's new John one that's
black and which I also got last year and
they've lasted me so so well they're so
comfy as well so I got that and I
thought you see if you really want to
know and then from ping I feel like
Pink's is the best sale out of yes
unlike pink
best thing I got with some yoga jogging
pants just because I love the feel of
these and I can just tell they will be
so comfy around the house and at the gym
I want to say because they I'm going to
start going to the gym in the new year
and it just got a really thick waistband
these ones are just plain black and then
they say pink on them there they are the
universe cheap flares and I got them in
as small just because they are all my
pants from MVS in a small and then yeah
they flare out of the bottom and it just
looks so comfy like I love them so much
I got the exact same style in like a
gray pair as well so like a really dark
um
marbled great and then they again
they've just got a black waistband at
the top and the little doggy there these
are actually yoga
so they're not quite the same it says
they are compass bootcut so yeah I'm
gonna absolutely love those they were
what price today they were 27 pound 50
reduced from 40 pounds got a cute little
pair of shorts as well because I love
these for working out when I do actually
work out there just a little mini shorts
and those are the front of them they've
got really thick waistband which I love
and then they say love pink just in
whites hats and everyone alike any of
the crazy stuff that pink does I feel
like some things are like leopard print
and like sparkly text and that's just so
not me like I just love the stuff it's
black white plain normal Tex like that's
my favorite stuff from now and so yeah
they'll just have a great waistband and
then they are black shorts and they were
12 pound reduced from 17 pounds at 50
now the last thing I got was a massive
oversized sort of like um fleecy jumper
this is just like a high round neck and
it's got the little dog in a black print
and then towards the bottom it's just
got the pink badge embossed in it and
it's kind of like a woolly texture I
just thought this would be really nice
for like lounging around the house
because I have so many jumpers from pink
that I just love to wear around the
house and like day to day and stuff so
