video that I have seen it quite a lot of
people doing recently I'm not entirely
sure you started it so if you know then
leave a comment below because obviously
I want to give someone credit and it's
basically called YouTube made me buy it
and I haven't watched loads of these I
watched Emily's and she's she's done it
a different way to how I'm gonna do it
so I'm not sure if there's like a
certain way you're supposed to do it but
it's basically showing a bunch of
products that YouTube made me buy pretty
much they have so everything in this
video are products that I've seen other
Beauty youtubers using that have then
made me want to buy them I'm basically
going to talk through everything and
then tell you like my thoughts on it and
whether I think it was worth the money
and because obviously YouTube can be
known for sort of like hyping products
up that aren't worth the hype so I'm
going to go through like a lot of
different products that basically chose
one from every category and we're gonna
have a chat about it also I realized
this makeup would look way better with a
wing and I realized after I finished it
and then I was two ladies doing so don't
mind me so the first thing is a primal
it's not primer but it's what I'm going
to have in like my primer category this
is the Nivea man sensitive at post shave
balm I'm pretty sure nikkietutorials was
the first person to use this but correct
me if I'm wrong in like seen any of
their so this isn't a primer and it's
obviously a post shave balm for men and
but a lot of people started using this
because it contains glycerin it's like
it's top ingredient I believe the
ingredients on the back and but glycerin
helps anything that you put on top of it
to really adhere so it works really well
as a base because then your foundation
on top and sticks a lot better and lasts
longer this I purchase it's about two
pound it's usually on offering boots and
it literally cost me two pound it's a
good size jar and it lasts me a good few
months so for a primer it's really
inexpensive I have loved this since the
day I bought it obviously I bought it
because it was very hyped about it
because YouTube made me buy it I love
this I definitely notice a difference
with the way my foundation goes on I
feel like the combination of this and
any foundation I use it works so so well
and my makeup does last a lot longer
throughout the day especially with its
essence right as well I just noticed
such a big difference from the minute I
saw geez in this yeah I do really like
this some people don't but I feel like
it's definitely worth trying for the
um so yes that was worth the money I'm
just going to hide a minute because
there's two guys in like the back garden
next to me um they're like building
awesome it and you can literally see
right into my window and they're just
sort of looking at me like what is she
doing okay next thing is foundation this
is the Ultra HD this is a liquid form
and this was the first I think this was
the first product I ever had from Make
Up For Ever I bought it was I was in
Dallas last October and I feel like
there's a stage on YouTube when this was
so hyped about like so many people we
use net and the main person I remember
is like Jaclyn hill possibly I can't
remember I just never seen it in so many
videos so when I finally got to America
and there was the chance to buy makeup
forever and I picked it up straight away
I never really understood the hype with
this like I wasn't a massive fan of it
and I felt like it was kind of hard to
blend and sometimes if I did it with
like my normal buffing brush and it's a
light to medium coverage I would say and
I definitely prefer like a medium to
fall I don't know I didn't particularly
like the finish of it I felt like I felt
like I had as a prime really heavily to
use it so it might be the sort of thing
that's better with oily skin I don't
know if anyone's got this let me know
your thoughts in the comments down below
but obviously a lot of you will know
that the whole Ultra HD stick is my
favorite foundation ever and I feel like
that just blows this one out the water
port concealer I've got the Urban Decay
Naked skin and I bought this because of
Jacqueline Hale she raved about this
24/7 and I'm pretty sure she said it was
like a favorite in her like ride-or-die
makeup or maybe she didn't I don't know
what she used to bring about this all
the time I first got this in the shade
light warm and and it was a little bit
too dark for me to highlight with when I
didn't have ton on so I ended up getting
fat neutral afterwards which is
obviously a lot paler I do love the
consistency of this it's a very like
hydrating concealer in my opinion which
is really good for me because my skin's
like normal to dry that's going to annoy
me it sits really nicely under the eyes
and it feels really hydrates and it
doesn't feel like heavy um you know some
can see those are quite thick and they
just sort of feel really dry and heavy
on your eyes this one never does that I
just struggle because I feel like this
creases on me it's so much like more
than any other concealer I have and a
lot of people say the
it doesn't but for me it really does I
dried off it side the way I'm blending
now all the way I apply it and but I
never use this on its own if I do use it
I'll use it with another concealer to
brighten it and because I love the fact
that the shade is so pale like I feel
like it's really rare to get a concealer
that's like light enough my plight is
this I don't know I like having it like
I will definitely repurchase it and
because for me it's an essential to
light and concealers that aren't light
enough but I wouldn't use it on its own
and the formula I feel like isn't as
full coverage as I want it to be I don't
think it's marketed as that anyway so
that doesn't really matter I know it
says weightless complete coverage
concealer or powder we've got the Laura
Mercier translucent this just looks like
so and everyone and then mums was like
raving about this for so long I feel
like people still do it's a really good
powder I only like it to set my under
eyes and I do really love it for that
because I feel like it really does
prevent creasing for me I don't use it
all over my face and just because I feel
like it really does dry my skin out
quite a lot I've been using the RCM a1
for like all of my face recently as well
as like the my criminal eyes because I
don't feel like that as dry in if I use
this all of my face I feel like halfway
through the day it's sort of like cracks
on my skin and I can see like my
foundation is really like clinging to
dry patches definitely think it's worth
the money because you got even though
it's expensive you got I've got chunk of
product and if you like me and you're
only going to use it under the eyes and
it lasts a long time so yeah I love it
and I do repurchase that moving on to
bronzer so this is hoola by benefit I
feel like everyone that loves this and
everyone's loved it for a really long
time
the one person who ended up making me
buy it was money anyway because he used
to rave about it I'm pretty sure he
still does so this is what it looks like
it just comes in a little cardboard box
I have like a love-hate with this
packaging I do think it's quite cute and
it fits well into makeup like my makeup
storage but it gets quite dirty and I
don't like that this is so deep because
I feel like with my bronzer brush it's
quite large and it's really hard to like
get it in and swirl it around I feel
like it puts a lot of product on like
one place on the brush and then it sort
of blends it really muddy sometimes I
love the color of there
I love it so much it makes a really good
bronzer but also like a really good
contour shape because it's definitely
like not too warm and it's got a sort of
car key base I would say so it's not
like too warm that you can't use it to
contour with and and I do feel like I
can use it when I'm not got a tan and
when I do have a tan and just sort of
like build it up which is really good so
Unser blushes i've got two of the becker
and what these called mineral blush is
so this one in particular called flower
child I bought this because of
Jacqueline Hale recommended it and raved
about it so it's kind of like a pinky
rosy color it's really nice in the
spring and summer time and I do really
love these and I love the packaging the
start is like Becca packaging it feels
really luxurious the actual product is
really nice as well because I feel like
with a lot of backup products I'm not
even just the blushes and like the
highlighters and just the powders in
general you can really build them up so
that sort of a light wash of color when
you put them on but you can really build
them up to the way you want them to look
that one that is damselfly I think you
can just about see it and then flower
child is like on my thumb and it's more
of a pink yeah they just blend it in
like a dream they feel really weightless
on your skin and they just feel really
silky and soft and I love that blend for
highlighter I thought I would include
the glow kit by anastasiya because I
feel like anything Anastasi Beverly
Hills I definitely buy because people on
YouTube recommend it obviously it's not
a brand that we can shop in store in the
UK and sing with Becca although I'm
pretty sure that's in space and K now
but in particular a Nastasia I usually
got off people's recommendations because
it has to be bought online this is one
of her glow kits I only have one of
these which is this one and it's in the
style shade Sun dip this is what it
looks like when you open it up so it
comes with four different highlighters
um they do actually pop out I'm pretty
sure although I'm not going to risk it
my two favorites in this our summer
which is this one here and is this moon
moonstone which is that one now it's
more of like a pinky toe and it's what
I've got on today I basically mixels and
then pop it on the tops of my cheekbones
and if I want something a bit more
intense so I'll just use some on its own
I loved it
when I've got no Vatanen because it's
like a really nice pale gold love these
it sits so beautifully on the skin they
just like melt in with the foundation
they're not chalky they're not powdery
they don't look you know highlighters
sometimes like if they're too powdery
and they just sit on your skin and then
just look like this up there and they
don't look like an actual glow and these
don't do that they just like melt into
Foundation and like y'all the powders
and stuff and I love them so much and
then for mascara for mascara we've got
the benefit roller lash and there's a
time when so many people using this I'm
pretty sure Joey made me buy this in
particular because I'm sure she used to
rave about it 24/7 I don't really know
like how I felt about this and I've not
repurchase another one at since I do
really like it so good mascara but if
you if you guys know me like it takes me
a lot to like be really blown away by a
mascara because I just feel like they
all do the same thing I don't know if
it's just me but so many people will
always be like oh my god this mascara
it's incredible like it really lifts and
it makes my lashes so long and it makes
it look so thick and I just feel like
every mascara that I have does that I
don't know if it's because I don't
actually just like like my natural
lashes in general and I don't know it
just takes a lot of me to be really
blown away by a mascara I'm not the sort
person who has like a favorite mascara
that I have to take with me everywhere
yeah I don't know I wasn't like
disappointed with it but it was just a
bit like you know like I wouldn't
repurchase it but I did definitely use
it I do still use it now and then for
false eyelashes I felt like I had to
include these oh these are the iconic
spy House of lashes I can't remember
like who actually made me buy these but
I just think seeing them on like YouTube
Instagram there's just a point where
I've seen them everywhere I never used
to be very adventurous with lashes I
would use a lot of like red cherry and
stuff that's like inexpensive and easy
to get if you're in the UK and it was
never the sort of thing that I'd spend a
lot of money on whereas now I'm the
complete opposite like I'll happily
spend 30 pound on Russia's if I know
they're gonna last a long time and look
really good I do I love these you guys
know these were one of my favorite
lashes for a long time I don't really
wear them a lot anymore because they're
quite um how do I
grab them they're quite like they're not
very wispy they're quite intense and
very like strike in whereas I prefer
lashes now to be quite fluttery and
wispy and like a similar shape but the
actual like lashes I just preferred them
to be like thinner and like Morpho don't
know if I'm making any sense that is
what they look like like you've probably
seen me why than a million times they
just look the way I would describe them
is they look obviously fake sometimes is
what I'd say there's times when I put
them on and it's like you can really
tell I've got false eyelashes on whereas
now I like watches I can put them on and
they look really intense and dramatic
but they don't necessarily look really
obviously like false lashes I don't know
if I'm making any sense and but I do
love these they last forever I can use
mine for like a month at a time which is
like 20-plus uses and they last really
well if you're like I'm speaking for
ages about each product but I want to
give you all my thoughts so I do
recommend these if you like intense
lashes that are like a cap shape then
you will love these so but pallets /i
shadows I picked out my naked palettes
because I don't use these a lot on
camera but I bought them because so many
people on YouTube rave about them so
I've got all four and there's one two
three and then the smokey one and I do
like these I just don't reach for them
Allah favorite ones are definitely one
two and three probably one being my
absolute favorite and I don't know I
feel like this one they'll just never be
like I love the sort of mix of like
shimmers maps have got a good transition
color in there and two good transition
colors actually and then they've got
like Dark One's like creep and gunmetal
and then obviously the really pretty
Gold's as well this for me is like an
all-around palette that you can use for
like daytime or night The Naked 2 for me
is a little bit more cool tone so it's
not got as many warm shadows and which
again I do really like but obviously I'm
more of like a warm eyeshadow person so
I reach for the naked one more and but I
do like that this one comes with a matte
black because the first one it didn't
and I do feel like that's an essential
and then three I absolutely adore but I
love this more so in the spring and
summertime and this is just so good for
anyone that
girly that likes like flirty pretty
makeup all that grows you turns and
pinky tones and this one-on-one is
probably my favorite and yet like I said
I do feel it can achieve a night time a
daytime or a nighttime look which is
really handy sometimes bothers me when
palettes which I'm actually going to
speak about this one in a minute and
don't come with like enough shadows like
after you like if you're going to make a
palette you need to make something where
you can just use that one palette for
one look and you don't have to grab
anything else this one I feel like they
didn't do with this obviously the first
three came with like a nice amount of
like transition colors and stuff and so
maybe they didn't feel the need to do
that with this one and but I have to say
I never reach for this like I really
don't love it that much mostly because
it doesn't have a good transition color
like the only matte Brown is this shade
here which is whiskey and it's like a
really dark brown which she couldn't use
as in any fun oh my gosh an initial
crease color I would say in my opinion
and and that just bothers me it's like
there's so many shadows in here and I
just think like putting one extra like
neutral color in that was mark would
have just made this palette like so much
better because in my opinion like you
wouldn't just be able to take this on
holiday and just have this like you'd
also have to have like either the first
one or the second one and whereas the
other ones I feel like you can just take
the one palette and you've got to go
YouTube definitely did make me buy this
and just Instagram in general and
probably having all the pallets name by
this because I do love the other ones
but I just did a little bit as much as I
thought I would and I don't use it as
much as I thought I would um yeah all
right on to lip product and represent
YouTube made me buy these these are the
Gerard cosmetics lipsticks I have a
couple of these but I've picked out my
two favorite ones which is nude and
buttercup there was a time when I first
started youtube when everyone like in
America especially was raving about this
cuz obviously it's an American company
and Jacqueline Hale in particular she
did have a range with them at one point
which was actually bata caught on like
shredder lipstick or like 1995
in and a couple of other things so
because a lot of you know she was a
massive inspiration for me I bought some
of soft based on her recommendation and
I do really like these and I don't reach
them a lot anymore probably because I
like out-of-date and he's got in the bin
and but I did really like these in
particular this one in the shade nude
was my favorite nude for a really long
time and just because like it had a nice
amount of like peach eNOS coral eNOS
Brown nurse that's like not even a word
and but it was just a really nice like
everyday basic new like it went with
everything and the only thing that
annoyed me about these and probably the
reason that I stopped using them was
they felt very drained on my lips like
this one because it's matte and it just
felt really dry on my lips like after an
hour or so of me wearing it and it
started to like rub like crumble crumble
up buttercup again I did really like
this and but I felt like it was very
similar to cream cup by Marc and I
prefer the formula of matte lipsticks so
I never really reach for this one as
much and but they are really lovely
lipsticks they're kind of hard for us to
get in the UK I'm pretty sure beauty
base tops the movie and we are YouTube
definitely made me up made me buy these
I don't regret buying them at all and I
do love a lot of the stuff that jarred
cosmetics do I just feel like I don't
reach for these a lot anymore because I
have things that I prefer so that was
everything I really hope you guys
