going to be a QA because I honestly feel
like I've not done one for the longest
time
don't mind me by the way I know that I
look like a toe but it's fine but anyway
I wanted to sound like a chat video
today because I feel like it's things so
long it's in sublet should just like sat
down and had a chat
been like super chilled and spoke about
things that you guys want to know about
and things that you've asked about and
things like that so I thought we would
just have a chat if I don't Twitter as
well to ask about stuff it's like more
personal it's just it's not like makeup
base because I feel like my channel is
pretty much makeup so gave you the
chance to ask about anything that you
wanted to know so I'm going to go
through some of the questions so I
screenshot them but I kind of want to do
them in a certain order so this is going
to be like a little bit difficult okay
so the first one I'm going to answer is
from Isabella and she asked what swayed
you to dye your hair will you be keeping
it for long PS I love it thank you
so it's Bella and a couple of other
people who asked about my hair I have
Tiger hair as you can maybe tell and you
know I don't I'm not loving it as much
as I was going to basically I went in
once into the light but it's just like
you know instant like you go to the
hairdresser's and yes isn't enjoyed and
it's nothing like what you think it's
going to be I didn't expect it to be
this blonde
I feel like this close one just doesn't
suit me at all like let me know let me
know the comments what you think about
my hair because I'm honestly not feeling
it and I need honest opinions definitely
like I said the reason I wanted it like
that I wouldn't have to get my roots
tops of all the time but she's kept my
root like the same color so I'm kind of
like what do you know I don't know I
need you to tell me what you think I
need an honest opinion because I'm not
convinced on its be honest I just feel
like I wouldn't mind if my root wasn't
as dark or if the ends weren't as light
I feel like the contrast is just like
way too much so probably going to get
gemsto sue and Charlotte asked what is
the best thing about living by yourself
so I was aiming to spot now I live it
completely on my own animal nz's I would
say which is to be insisted like the
reason I moved out I would say to me it
is having this space and having the
independence like when I was back at
home my bedroom it makes me feel like
makes me feel warm when I think about my
bedroom because it is just like that's
why started YouTube and stuff like that
well now and yeah my bedroom was so
small and we didn't really have a lot of
other rooms in the house that we have
four bedrooms but one of them is an
office like a really small it's a
smaller bedroom like smaller than mine
it's like cost
Weezer's an office space for dad and I
kind of like crammed into there a little
bit as well like that I used to have my
wife like my white sequin backdrop and
uh I don't know like I just feel like I
didn't have enough space that's the
reason I moved out so definitely like
having the room and just having the
independence I feel like it's been I
mean I've been here what five months I
feel like it's been a really interesting
five months because it actually had to
like live by myself look after myself
but pay for everything and I placed in a
good experience so yeah
desire tree I don't know I kind of go
into a rumble affair and I'm following
on from that Holly asked do you think
you've changed this since moving into
your own place which I thought was a
really interesting question because
don't on the phone I was actually
thinking about this other day because I
do feel like so different now which I
guess is normal and but I don't know
it's like a good different I feel like
since I've been here I don't know it's
just like not I don't really know I feel
a lot different um and it's not I have
not always been not that I really share
this but I've not always felt like
really happy here and I am much too
moving home which I've only told always
told like a couple of people but I am
actually moving home in August this
contract was only a six month contract
so I didn't have to be here for any
longer than that I could have rolled it
over if I wanted to and but I'm actually
moving home I feel like I'm just worried
that I like flew the nest too quickly
like I left home weight quicker than I
should of like I got really fixated on
the idea of like moving out and having
my own space and stuff but now that oh
my gosh I went in as a silent now that I
actually live on my own I don't love it
as much as I thought I would I don't
know what it is like I can't quite put
my finger on it but I feel like I just
need to go home for a little bit like
reevaluate and then um move out again at
another point I also really don't like
renting at all so in future like I'm
going to save up like super deposit and
buy somewhere and but I do feel like I'm
a different person that I've moved out
which is normal obviously it's such a
big like part of your life it's change
like where you
and I have to say like I don't really
like I don't want to tell many people
but I've not been like majorly happy
here and it's been nice obvious like me
and Cain Cain can come around and like
we have our own say some things and but
that's like probably the only thing that
I really love about it like the space
and like the independence like I said
yeah in short I feel like I change and
don't feel like it's in a good way so
I'm going back home which mom's really
happy about because she's been stuck
with like dad and Charlie and that's it
and the crazy house Charlotte how did
you meet Cain and how did you in Cain me
and do you see yourself with him for the
rest of your life I know personal five
I'm nosy it's fine I asked impersonal so
me and Kane actually Matt I haven't
edited is like on a video and but we
actually met on tinder which I always
just want to last when I say that
because I am sort of person where I
generally just had tinder for like a
joke
didn't take it seriously at all like it
was just a bit of a laugh um I don't
know it just is it's just a bit of a
laugh of it when you with your friends
nice why some people left or right like
it was one of those like sorts of things
anyway I might like save this story
because me and Kane like I kind of going
to do a video and we go on holiday we'll
going on holiday in three weeks I think
we're going to like film something what
we're on holiday so I might save like
doctor then and but yeah we might
something that I mean yeah like you
didn't message me he messaged me Rosie
didn't message me for about six months
after him ah and then we got chatting
and like within three like messages that
were sent to each other that it was like
that I was like oh my gosh I just knew
that we'd like get on so well oh yeah
and then I feel like spending the rest
of my life with him which is like a
really big thing to say and a sort of
person where I don't know if it's just
me but I would never get myself into a
relationship unless I generally think
it's going to last
yeah like I don't get why people get
themselves into a relationship and think
oh like I'll just see where it goes or
it's probably not going to last I'll
just do it anyway because just thing
like what is the point like your waste
in each of this time I don't know like I
would just never I've only ever had two
proper relationships which I'm costing
this is one and my ex-boyfriend roses
for four years is the other and I would
never get myself into a relationship if
I didn't think it was going to be like a
long time
um so yeah I guess we'll see this is
Danielle asked if you could go back in
time and do something differently what
would it be and why
Livia look you too I was thinking about
this earlier because I was reading these
my screen showing them as I was like
picking out which one to answer um I
always think about this a lot like one
thing I really regret which I don't like
to have regrets because I feel like
everything I've ever done has gotten to
where I am now and I like Who I am now
um but I wish I'd like enjoyed being but
a young teenager more and like young MA
I feel like going through like being 10
11 12 13 14 15 mother ah I feel like I
just wish those years the way I had
didn't actually focus on enjoying those
years like I always just felt like I
can't wait see 18 I can't wait to do my
own thing like oh la la la I don't know
like I just wish I'd enjoyed them more
because now that they've got I miss you
in my age I feel is so common like
whenever I tell people that they always
say they clearly because at the exact
same special night we spend all our
young years
wishing away and wishing we were like 18
21 or whether and then we get to 18 or
21 and I like actually an adult with
like proper things to do and we're like
why why did I not make the most of those
years so if anyone is like young teens
or young make the most of it because I'm
associate so much I wish I was like a
lot of things I've done definitely in
them as well again I like to have
regrets well ah yeah Alice asked what is
your favorite childhood memory mm which
is a good question I ought again because
I think about a lot like I don't know
why but I do think about like my
youngest my young B is a lot and one
thing that I used to love doing with my
family was like guilty sense parks um we
when I think how many times have been
spent apart so if anyone's been it's
like one of the best places ever and
it's like a proper family holiday to me
I feel like I'll probably go with Kane
as like a couple thing at some point but
I feel like it's such a family holiday
like if I think Center Parcs I just
think family and I'm like I just used to
love going like we'd had to go with
obviously mom tied Charlie and then my
grandparents always go with Justine
Simon in the boys which is like our
second like God family I guess
and and it's just like when I think
about then they were the best times ever
and I miss them I'm gonna rig up that
don't get that honestly I feel like
thinking about when I was younger times
like it actually it doesn't make me
sighs but you know when it just like
stop stop something Chloe asked if you
could travel to anywhere in the world
world be and why I for the longest time
now I got fifty the longest time
probably like the past year I have been
so desperate to go to the Maldives
obviously it's like the bougie Escala
day on the planet it's one of those
things where I feel like if you're going
to do it like you have to go all out and
me and Rachel actually like thinking
about going into summer we don't know
for going yet I haven't but it's one of
those places so it's like on my bucket
list like I have to go so I don't know
if it'll be this summer with Rach or
that we another summer or another time
but I'm like I have to go it just looks
so stunning
like the overwater hearts like the wall
Sevilla's and stuff oh it just looks so
nice and so peaceful and it's one of the
places that I just really want to go and
like experience myself so the MALDI mal
asked does it worry you that YouTube may
not grow as much as people think and
starts decline especially as though it's
your job again and probably something
that I don't really think about a lot by
occasionally things like what would are
you if I feel now what would I do if you
shoes just shut down or if my channel
just started decline in like what would
I do you know it's one of the things I
don't really think about too much
because I genuinely believe like I'm one
of these people that says everything
happens for a reason and if anything was
to happen like that then it would be for
a reason even if I didn't obviously
don't want it to happen but that'd be
something I guess to do and I think it's
a great I like you can't worry about it
like you just gotta stick to what you
know and as long as you enjoy what you
do I feel like it doesn't matter too
much obviously let you search for people
like myself where it's a full-time job
it's a little bit different and but I
feel like I have so much support as
support at home has support with my
management I have support from you guys
and I just don't like I don't think
about it even if I got like worried
sometimes or if I think I'm luck in like
I've had such a period recently where
I've been really lucky in like um
creativity and just knowing what I want
to do okay genuinely don't know what
directions
my channel at the minute it's like yeah
it's not scary but it's just a bit we
have like a blurry patch a gas and but
even in times like that like I just yeah
I just think everything always works
itself out so fingers crossed it well so
I don't know your name but at lyric
Fletcher as dish King know about your
job slash profession before you fart one
another you guys are beautiful
thank you so much because you're
beautiful as well I genuinely stopped
you Twitter no not well I think no but
obviously he we met on tinder and my
Instagram was linked to my tinder and he
didn't really I think I don't think he'd
like no it wasn't really spoken about
for a long time as well like we met a
lot and stuff I'm we kind of just like
chat about random stuff and generally
like you didn't really know at first and
I think even when I began to tell him we
did it it's fully understand at first
which I don't think anyone does
especially if you not into makeup or
YouTube it's hard to grasp I think even
my parents still to this day don't
understand everything and because it
really is like a world of its own I
think like a mushy in it or you watch it
you don't it's hard to understand some
things but no it didn't no at all really
and it doesn't a while to understand
what it kind of gets it now and he's
really supportive which is obviously
amazing Rosie asked would you like to
get married and have children yes one
day I feel like you know I don't know
it's weird I feel like they're ages I
was always like I never want children I
just couldn't see myself having kids at
all and but I feel like I will one day
probably not for a while I don't know
it's hard to know cuz I feel like I
never plan anything and then all of a
sudden it just happens and I'm like ok
yeah I would like to get married as well
though again it's not like anything
that's a rush I don't know I don't know
like what age I knew that would happen
um but I'd like to think that I will get
my and have children at some point in my
life I'd be so cute like a baby her next
Rene oh my gosh stop it a panic stop
Isabella asked best and worst things
about YouTube I would say the best
things are having such an extended
family
aka you honestly like that is the best
thing like meeting you all chatting with
you all like I love it
I really do
and I guess I'm making content I'm
really proud of like if I make a video
and I'm super happy with it that makes
me really happy and I like knowing you
like the content as well I guess
and I would say as the things that I
also like working with really cool
brands can't forget that that's like
something I never even dreamed to do as
goodness but that's like one of the
coolest things ever I would say the
worst thing which like it's kind of
funny because again I was I was speaking
to learn about this the other day and I
see config Gabby about it as well and
kind of like YouTube sometimes being if
there is a lonely job like I don't want
to call it a job because I don't like
and I want to complain about being a job
before anyone gets on with twisted and
become any kind of like lonely sometimes
not in like obviously it's not lonely
because we have like I have so many
wonderful friends to have all of you and
like real chat as jobs like it's not
like that kind of lonely it's more so
the actual work not that class is work
you know I mean it's kind of hard to
work at the actual creating content and
sometimes editing is just like my
day-to-day situation is pretty much like
a get up I will film a video for example
and then I'll edit it instead of can it
will be uploaded and you kind of just
like do it all by yourself like that's
what I'm trying to say like you do
everything pretty much by yourself
unless it's like a collab or um you're
working with a brand or something like
that is very like yeah probably like you
and just you unless you have a channel
that's like not to see what to myself
obviously just just and well yeah it can
get like a little bit lonely sometimes
which like I said I don't like complain
because I think I have to call a shove
in the world and I don't know if anyone
else is watching this who is who's a
creator do you get one saying do you get
one thing or if you're a viewer do you
like can you get one soon don't not try
to say well it's like being in
Manchester I do not I don't really have
any friends here that do YouTube so it's
just yeah I guess it gets like it a
little bit lonely sometimes that's not
so sad I don't know I wonder I'm not
complaining but let's robably like the
only things okay so I don't really name
either what up hey Beach ten asked what
age were you when you got your first
period and do you have any embarrassing
period stories love you so let me do I'm
pretty sure I was 12 I think I was 12
when I got my first pair
it was pretty chilled literally just
like once the toilet had of it the
situation after mom and that was like
very long I feel like in virus and Perry
stories when I was 16 or so I'd say
Brendon mind I was in a relationship for
like four years
when I was 15 I was on the injection and
which is like a form of contraception
and whatnot I used to get the worst case
ever onion jam like I can't even explain
through how bad they were and which is
kind of like the opposite of what you
supposed to have on the injection if
anyone has it like usually don't really
get any but I was the opposite like I
was pretty much on all the time and they
were really heavy like they weren't so
much I didn't get hairy pains but they
were just super heavy and I just
remember one time like I mean this is so
TMI what you've asked for it so here we
go beam in Travis enter I have my school
uniform on which was I have a skirt on I
didn't have lights on it was summertime
and and like I said I did not have like
a pattern or I didn't have anything like
that it would literally just happen and
it would be duh and I was literally
walking through an exit and all of a
sudden like science is so grim but you
asked for it I genuinely just felt like
blood dripping down my life it wasn't
like you know I just came on my period
and it was just like a little bit and it
was fine like genuinely that's how heavy
I was it was just like blood streaming
down my leg and I looked down because I
felt the heat of it like I felt the
whole haunted the blood this okra about
the warmth of the blood and then I
looked down and I saw it just with like
wooden down my leg of my spirit and I
was like oh my god I have never run so
fast with her in my life and I literally
just sat there for ages like swatting
myself out and clean myself up
luckily no one saw me I don't think I
mean it probably saw me running to the
toilet but and I used to be really
self-conscious about them because they
were super heavy and they were just
unpredictable like they would just come
and be there and they'd be like bitch
you've got a deal with it so hope that
wasn't too TMI I mean we're all girls
some of the boys I'm sure you don't mind
you came out of a joiner anyway number
ass is that anything significant that's
happened in your life to make you the
person you asked today and when I was
the question I was trying to think like
do you mean like long-term or to me like
recently so I'm gonna like cover both I
guess like long-term and recently
long-term I would say something that
really shaped me so what is it huh
something that really like shaped me I
would say it is like the person I am now
was my relationship with my ex-boyfriend
which like I said I was in it for four
years and from 14 to almost 13 like just
about soon 14 to 18 and that really
shaped me as a person I think it wasn't
a healthy relationship I thought is very
toxic which a lot of you know about so
how to apply a little bit in the past
but it was a super toxic relationship it
just wasn't the best it's like don't get
me wrong like some parts work good and
stuff and sometimes it was good but a
lot of the time it was like really quite
bad and and I think that seriously like
when that ended I was like a new person
I felt like I'd learned so much like
four years is a long time especially
when like you that young as well and I
felt like it really just like yeah I
feel like I grew up a lot in it like by
the time so it ended like just before I
turned 18 I feel like I was really
mature by then I don't know I just feel
like it really shaped the person I am
now probably cause like it's such a like
I'm only 19 and it's pretty much like
the biggest thing that ever happened to
me in my life anyway so recently I would
say like can I feel like I'm becoming
like a different person every other week
at minute and it it's so weird
now that it's a blessing but um I would
say recently like moving out is
definitely made me a bit of a different
person as I said like before not in like
loads of good ways but like in good ways
as well like I've learned a lot being
here on my own like taking care of
myself managing my money um I dunno if
any I guess it just helped me like I
could grow up a set more even though I
am going home to my mom and my dad you
know I I didn't wanna bring this up
because like I still struggle to speak
like a little bit but um like I feel
like I've been so different since um the
concert which was just over a month ago
now how those it was pretty much the
silver months ago yeah I feel like the
concert like even though like I said
I absolutely nothing happens near we got
out save it's fine like you know we're
fine I feel like that really um just
like that whole like experience just
like really I've been a lot different
since that I think I don't know what it
is I don't really put my finger on it
but I feel like I've not been I know for
fact that I've not been as present mom
anyway yeah as I was saying I feel like
um since I've just been so different
like I've not been as present on YouTube
or on many social medias I have been on
Instagram but like I feel like on
Twitter and especially snapchat as well
like I've just not been on socials as
much since I happen okay so I'm pretty
sure I've just been chatting and the
cameras like not being recording because
they have a cutout and then I went to be
started what I just realized about
buttons not on some like I'm pretty sure
the last thing I would have been talking
about them which I saw I recorded which
I haven't recorded was about like the
constant stuff and how that's like um
change things
I thought me what I lost that now yeah
it's just basically like I feel like
I've not been as present on YouTube and
socials and stuff which I'm trying to
get back into again because obviously I
want to be present on youtuber socials I
think it's kind of just like changed how
much time I spend on things like on
snapchat and so it's like snapchat and
Twitter as like I'm YouTube especially
I've not been on as much so yeah I feel
like that has been seeing that most
recently has like affected Here I am now
because I have really been sort of like
in a place recently where I just want to
really make the most of like life I
guess and just like being with friends
and family and my boyfriend and I don't
know just I guess like yeah I guess like
the whole thing was what happened in my
Chester just really makes you like
realize how unpredictable life is and
even though I love what I do so much
like it obviously is still important to
be present in your actual life as well
and don't know if I'm making any sense
so I feel like some it's like concert as
well I it's weird like a hardly worn
makeup at all and obviously I went to
Ibiza twice since then and I feel like
that's awfully like that's really the
only time that I've worn makeup properly
me and Ellie
get ready with us which I mentioned in
that video for the concert which I never
edited or uploaded exciting wants to
watch it had still about the footage in
case I ever do you want to watch it but
I just haven't obviously we filmed it in
the backroom where like my secret
bachelor phase and since that day like I
have generally not sat down and filmed a
makeup tutorial in that room or like
with that set up I don't know what it is
like obviously it's nothing really to do
with like what happened but I should
know there's something that just feels
like I just not brought myself like sit
back in that room and film something
again like knowing the last time we've
sat there we did our makeup and filmed
it and stuff and then went out and then
everything happened I mean I am gonna
have to sit down and I'm going to sit
down fountain 51 earlier because I've
got to do a sponsor video which is like
juice like next week sometime and but
yeah but even though we were like not
even fected
and we were so lucky to get out I feel
like that is the thing that's happened
most recently that's really changed me
as a person and I don't know if it's in
a bad way or a good way but it's just I
guess like it just put a lot of things
into perspective and it just I don't
know if this I've just taken a step back
a little bit okay this is the last one
I'm going out so excited I've been
running it for so long and Kay asked do
you have any exciting projects coming in
the future maybe doing some merchandise
or a tepee line so as I think I
mentioned earlier I would love to do a
beetle I wondered even though I'm not
wearing makeup makeup as much as I used
to when I do do my makeup I still love
doing it I just feel like I don't do it
as much and so I feel like I would love
to have a beauty line one day a Budda
Budda line and maybe do it like a little
bit different other makeup lines and
make it more like a range that is like
essentials because another thing as well
like recently like I was saying like I'm
not really filmed in that back room I've
just been like so over having like such
an extensive makeup collection like I'm
just like it's so unnecessary like it's
just not needed which is why if you're
doing like giveaways and selling stuff
which the most
money's gonna go to charity and like
donate instead of like it's just one of
those things I think like there's just
no need to meet have like even like a
quarter of any of this and so I think if
I was to do a makeup line I do it less a
little bit differently and maybe the
student is like um makeup that I think
is like essentials um yeah that's like
what I have in mind for like doing a
makeup line maybe I'll do it one day
because I do still love it but I just
kind of like sit for what I know I stick
to what I love and I think like most
regular girls do and but in the
merchandise know me and Cana actually
work out something a little secret and
because Kane basically came up with this
idea something that he wants like he
wants to do and I really like the idea
of it so we're kind of like working on
it together at the minute not going to
give you too much away and but it's kind
of like fashion based so yeah he's
basically just like Cameron Diaz like
Hannah like I have a really cool idea
this is something that I want to do and
it's something that's like so pain as
well like obviously not met in yet but
um I don't anyone I might give too much
away but yeah we're kind of like in the
midst of like working on something and
seeing like costumes of things and how
we want to design things and I'm not
really going to pay too much more and
but yeah I think you'll like you I think
you'll like it everyone is to pull it
out and actually go through I could be
sitting all this and then it could never
happen but if it does I think it will I
think they'll like it and I think
they'll think it's cool because we think
it's cool oh yeah those are all the
questions that I'm going to answer I'm
so hot I don't know what it is but I can
actually feel my back sweat in I think
it's really because about hoody on but I
always get a little more hot when I film
videos it is kind of weird I hope you've
enjoyed this video anyway sorry it was
just like super run like rumbly and run
name and just like usual it for just
