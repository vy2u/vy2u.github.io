be a story time video because I've
honestly been enjoying so much just like
sitting here fresh-faced and just
chatting with you all so essence
whatever what you wanted to see and a
lot of you asked for a story time on
this particular topic which as you can
probably tell from the title is going to
be about my experience with lip fillers
so yeah I've had blitzes obviously and
it was kind of funny like when I mention
this on to a lot of you said that you
couldn't really know is which is kind of
a good thing I guess because I don't
really want them to look like too
obvious and put yeah I've had lip
fillers so I thought I would chat
through my experience and so for those
of you who are considering doing it or
those of you who just want to know what
it's like um yeah just want to give a
quick disclaimer obviously and just say
that I'm not making this video trying to
like encourage everyone to get lip
fillers like that's not what this video
is about you guys know me like I'm very
much the sort of person where if you
want to get something done and you have
an appropriate age and you've researched
it properly and you know you stuff on it
and it's something that you want to
spend your own money on for whatever you
like personal reasons are by all means
do it and but don't ever feel like
influence you got something done just
because someone else gets it done or
like any anything like that don't ever
feel like you have to get something
wrong because you know yeah all the
people are getting a joint or people are
telling you that you should get it done
like that is not what this video is
going to be about it's just like my
experience this guys know me and I just
want to put that out there because I
don't want anyone watching this thinking
that I'm like encouraging people to get
things done like that's not what this is
about like I got my lips done my own
personal reason and if other people want
to do that as well and that's completely
fine but never feel that you have to do
something I'll change something about
yourself just because other people are
getting like this things have changed or
because like you feel pressure to like
yes the others video is basically going
to be a bit of a chat about my
experience because I feel like my
experience has been a little bit
different than other people's
possibly I've had my lips done at 3
times now and I've been to the same lady
every single time I completely trust her
she's incredible I've honestly one of
the most important things is go into
someone who you know knows that stuff
like you know that qualifies they're
completely professional they've got good
experience and I feel like you know
little eyes are a common thing now I
feel like it's very easy to get them
John and it's honestly just so important
to make sure that you go to the right
kind of person yeah she's honestly in
kind
like there's no one else that I would go
to especially after like my specific
experience now there's no one else I
would go to other than Jodi because I
just know that she knows me so well she
knows my lips so well like she takes
care of me when I'm in taken care of
like she I just know that I'm in good
hands when I'm with her which is so
important but yeah you guys are my
friends and if any of you ever consider
getting this John I just want to like
meet this video and talk about this so
that you know to go to the right kinds
of people and just like you know be safe
slice like the most important thing with
anything like this is to be saved so as
I said I think I said this I've had my
lips done at three times with Jodi now
so I started and hash no has died it
must have been like April what month are
we in yet must have been like early
April though I actually it found Jodi
through a friend who I'm not going to
mention her because I've not actually
asked if she's happy with me saying the
name in this video but I found Jodi
through a friend who I drink like
considering and lips done for quite a
while but I I just didn't know where to
go and it was it was just a sort of
thing that I would never go somewhere
just for the sake of it like I want to
know that I'm safe wherever I'm going my
friend really recommended her obviously
like I saw her lips as well and they
looked insane so I ended up making an
appointment Jodi and going to get them
done in terms of like the actual
procedure I was like made my appointment
instead of went and sat down and we have
to go through like an initial medical
form to sort of like identify any
allergies I had like just anything like
medication I've been on just like a
standard medical form before we like
obviously did the actual filling up the
lift then went through things like what
I hope to achieve with like my fillers
and styles like the things that I won
which for me I have wanted to basically
build a bit of a fuller lip and just
create a more defined shape and
especially in my top lip for quite like
before I had filler and with my top lip
like one side was a lot more straight
and one side was a lot more curved so it
was quite uneven like which isn't it's
not noticeable but you know when it's at
your own phase and obviously you look at
your athletes everyday so it's one of
those things that just stands out like
everyone knows that own body and their
own features and then she basically
spoke to me about like the filler the
type of filler she uses so I believe she
uses Juvederm and it basically consists
of hyaluronic acid which hyaluronic acid
is a
acid that your body naturally produces
anyway so it's nothing that's like
foreign that's being like injecting into
your lips as such is something that your
body does naturally produce so yeah I
had them done at the first time so we
did yeah but medical saab and she spoke
to me about the filler like what sort of
like results I was hoping for and then
of course before we actually did like
any of the actual inject in it she ran
through the possible complications that
can happen when you have in filler the
first one that you mentioned which was
kind of like an obvious one and isn't
really like dangerous as such is quite
common is like obviously bruising so
anytime you are like well so a lot of
people who like lip fillers and stuff it
is quite common to get bruising and just
tenderness and things like that the
first time I had them done I had a tiny
bit of bruising on the bottom lip I
didn't really have anything on my top
lip and I had a little bit on the bottom
lip but it was like absolutely fine it
faded in like two days and as I said it
is pretty normal to have that anyway and
then the next one that is obviously a
little bit more serious is the risk of
infection which when you are like
injecting and sort of like breaking the
skin there's always a possible risk of
intersection with anything like that so
that is kind of like the next one that
she sort of run through with me and then
at the next one it that she mentioned
after that was the risk of filler
basically getting into the blood vessel
which obviously causes a blockage which
would then need like emergency dissolve
in like the filler would have to be
dissolved immediately which is very rare
very rare obviously that happened to me
so hold honestly so yeah that's what
happened to me I had a vessel occlusion
in my lip this was the second time that
I got them done - didn't help around the
first time I'll carry on was like what
the procedure with Viking things and
what that is what happened to me
which it would happen to me of all
people aswath yeah the first time
absolutely find it run through all the
complications at the procedure all the
things that you need to know and sign
the form and everything and then she put
numbing cream on which thank the Lord
that she put numbing cream on because I
said I am a nightmare when it comes to
like any form of like needles or
anything like that and then obviously
she tops the numbing cream off and
properly like cleansed my lips and stuff
so that they you know completely clean
and it's such a weird sensation because
like they're just stuck looks like they
were so no like I could not feel
things and I'm pretty sure we did we did
one male on my first yeah we did one
male and we went to do one mil on my
second lot which I'll get into in a
minute did not hurt at all it really
didn't because my lips has a numbing
cream on I couldn't feel a thing and I'm
the filler that she uses anyway it does
actually have I don't know none of what
it has a net what it continues to normal
as she's injecting which is obviously
really good because you just do not feel
air in terms of like the sensation of it
like obviously like I said it's not
painful so I can't really like feel pain
I feel like the needle Pierce's skin a
little bit sorry Fox Creek TMI and I
feel the needle like pairs the skin and
then you can feel the filler like
filling your lip if that makes sense you
can feel the filler like go in in feel
it but it doesn't hear it just you can
just feel it if that makes sense it's
not like stop paying for but it's a bit
of an odd sensation up there but yeah
actually at both lips absolutely fine
like I did not really feel it at all and
then she showed it me in the mirror and
I absolutely love them so I went home
and they did they were very tender like
the actual like feeling of them
afterwards when the numbing creams
weren't asked like they were very tender
I genuinely had like mush at Weetabix
fatigue because I couldn't really like
Kane hello when I woke up in the morning
it was like I almost forgot for about
five seconds like you know when you
initially wake up and you just kind of
like don't really know what's going on
and I kind of forgot that I had them
done and that is when I love them the
most because I woke up and they just
looked perfect like they were just how I
helped them to be which is the thing for
me because I definitely like them the
most when they were when they were
swollen which is why I did go and get
them chopped up again it was about a
month and a half later when I got them
tucked up a guy so completely same
procedure I just went through all of
that again oh and then obviously put the
numbing cream and stuff on again she did
my top lip says and my friend who
actually recommended me to Jodie was
there as well because she was planning
to get his done after I got mine done
which she didn't in the end because I
ended up being that a lot longer than
I'd hoped to be like I said she did my
top lip first and that was absolutely
fine she showed it me in the mirror
before we moved on to the bottom lip and
I was like oh my god I loved it
we then started to do my bottom lip
which is where we had the issue so and
she did this side of my bottom lip first
which is my right side it'll probably be
your boob you'll be like your other now
yeah she did it my right side of my
bottom lip says and just as she started
like that was absolutely fine and then
actually went round to do my left side
and so basically finish off my lips my
mom calls my mom knows that I had my
lips done and stuff and but she didn't
know that I was like I hadn't like
texture and said well like I'm going
tonight and that make sense like she
knows I get them done but I don't tell
her when I'm like having appointments
just because like not anything funny but
I just I don't know I didn't so my mom's
crawl in and my friend who is with me is
like you want me to pick it up like does
she know that you're here and I was like
yet and you can answer the phone like
it's fine she knows like I haven't done
it you know fine
so she's basically trying to chatting
away to my mom and because obviously now
completely she was charity just like I
do a thing I wasn't really focusing too
much on what Jodi was actually doing at
this point I'm she was still like
injecting the color and stuff and I was
focusing more on like what the
conversation was with my mom so Jordan
basically starts this side of my lip my
bottom lip as I said and this is where
we had the issue because I basically had
we think now I had a partial occlusion
which an occlusion is like a blockage of
a blood vessel so what recently happened
is obviously I don't see it because I
don't hold a mirror I don't look at or
anything like that as she was injecting
the filler somehow part of the filler
managed to get into my blood vessel and
the way that Jodi described what
happened obviously like I said I can't
see she described it as like my whole
button lip just whited out completely
whited out because the blood supply was
obviously stopped so this is all going
on last my mom's on the phone and Jodi
is like speaking to me really quietly as
it like it obviously happened and she
was like so it happened and she said
it's a quite year lips occluded but
because my focus was on my mom and my
friends I didn't quite hear it first and
then she said it again and I looked her
and I was like when I looked oddly took
my attention away from my mom I could
see in her face that she was concerned
which I just want to put this into
perspective closure surgery's been doing
aesthetics for about four years I am the
first person she's had like personally
that has had a vessel occlusion like
she's never had before me anyone that
that's happened to she's obviously like
seen it happen in stuff but it's never
been like one of her own customers that
she's been
you know inject in straightaway she put
the needle down and she started
massaging my lip which basically when
you have like a vessel occlusion that is
the first thing that you have to do
she's basically try and get the filler
out of the vessel at this point I could
obviously tell I obviously knew
something was wrong was happening that
we do not want to happen so my friend
was still on the phone to my mom and
it's point I was like you need to give
us some slightly new I need space like
you need to take this up for him took
that boat out the room girl so that is
literally just what happened for about
like a good five minutes she was just
that massage in it because the way she
described it like I said my whole button
lips whited out which is probably not
that I saw it and not that we got it on
camera with stop recording by then but
it is probably a very frightening thing
to witness when it's especially when
it's like your own client don't for
myself I have to say like I genuinely
wasn't that panicked
because I know for a fact like like I
said I completely choice Jodi I would
not go to anyone who I didn't think like
couldn't handle a situation like that I
knew that she would be like it would be
absolutely fine I literally just left
inna to do what she had to do and she
was just there massage net until pretty
much the color returns my lip which the
strange thing was the color returned my
lip very quickly and like the blood
supply sort of like reinitiated very
quickly which is something that she said
is very like not common like usually if
it's a full vessel occlusion you can't
really like it's very hard to get the
filler out just by massaging you have to
basically highly sit straight away which
Hayley's is something that is again
injected it dissolved the filler
completely I wasn't in any pain at all
which is again probably another reason
why I wasn't panicking and like I said
completely to of schody even though it's
never happened to her personally I knew
that she would be more than capable of
dealing with the situation yeah that was
the strange thing about the whole thing
is the fact that if it had been a full
vessel occlusion there's a good chance
that like it would have been a miracle
for us to just like what surgeries just
massage to fill it out completely
without having to inject straight away
because that's pretty much what happened
like she massaged it and she said within
about 10 seconds the color was there
again and the blood was like you know
flowing flowing through again really
made us so lucky because when that
happened and eventually obviously she
gave me a mirror to show me what my lips
look like it looked normal like it felt
completely normal it looked normal like
nothing about it looked wrong so we
didn't really know what to do at that
point because obviously like the
what each like would normally do in that
situation if it was a full vessel
occlusion you would inject Halley's
straight away and that would dissolve
all the fill out and that would you know
pretty much like put an end to the
problem but because the color came back
so quickly and because I wasn't in any
pain there wasn't any sort of signs of
like Scylla still being in the bath all
we really didn't want to highlight
unless we really had to because it's not
like an Isis process to have to do like
I said highlight is injected but it's
just a lot more stinging and and I was
like because you've already had your
initial lot of injections like it just
kind of causes like more and more like
trauma and tenderness to the area so we
really didn't want to have to do it
unless we had to because the bottom lip
looked beautiful as well like it really
just like the whole like lit just looked
far and so we kind of ended up sitting
on it for a bit and like not just kind
of like waiting it out I was probably
there another two hours on top of like
what I was there for like my appointment
and stuff and it got to the point where
like obviously my friend had to go home
and she had to have a lipst another day
and which Jodie was so good like we
stayed there for ages we basically just
kind of waited like there was no real
rush to like hire lazier or like default
like you dissolve the filler or anything
because it looked fine but at the same
time it was kind of one of those things
where I did just want to like we didn't
just want to like send me home and then
for something to happen in the middle of
the night and then me have enough sleep
meltdown because you know I was flying
when I was I was like Jodie and I knew
that she knew what she was doing but it
had to go at home with an attack and
then and and it wasn't occlusion and we
hadn't done anything about it and I
would have like freaked out anyone's
wondering like the issues as well like
Susilo to get into your blood and job
and basically block the blood supply
like it just breaks down the tissues of
like your lips and stuff it can be so
dangerous so it's not really something
that you want to like take chances with
the sort yeah we sat there for ages
Jolie rung and message a lot of people
who she knew were also very experienced
in my aesthetics and lips who she knew
and had had situations like this before
and had had customers who had occlusions
because obvious like I said she hadn't
had any one before so she was kind of
just going off what she knew but because
this which like the whole situation was
so like not not saying not normal but it
just wasn't like what's the word because
the whole situation was just different
to how it normally would be with like a
for vessel occlusion like we just wanted
to make sure that we had like all like
good knowledge and good opinions before
we did anything the actual message a lot
of people they were all super helpful
and we kind of got mixed opinions
initially as to whether it was worth
highlighting or whether it's just leave
it and see you know if anything would
happen if anything happened we could
always highlight it tomorrow but yeah
like I said she massaged it a lot she
also did like popcorn brush they
basically did all the things that you
have to do when an occlusion happens
which is just a massage in it constantly
to try and get quite the blood to go in
and get like the filler out and put hot
crap like a hot compress on it again
just to help with like the blood flow
and things and we also constantly check
the capillary refill which capillary
refill is basically if you press down on
like your lip or like different areas of
your body and stuff and if you press
down and it's like five seconds or so
and then release your finger the area
will initially be white but then the
blood like should like sort of recently
propellor we should refill within one to
two seconds so if it takes any longer
than that then you know something's
wrong and I have to say in the end what
actually made us highlight it because we
did highlight it that same night after
about 2 hours of us sort of like oh man
and Arion and getting different opinions
and just waiting to see like will
actually happen with my lip we did
decide to highlight it and that was
mostly because the customary refill was
a little bit slower than it should be it
just wasn't wasn't quite what Jody
wanted it to be so at the end of a like
- hi ladies it does no harm at all like
no harm whatsoever I could only do good
or as if we left it then it could have
caused issues if there was still a bit
of Scylla in the vessel so basically
made the decision to highlight and
dissolve the filler so yeah that was a
little bit more singie
luckily like I said because we had to
like a bit of time to play with and
because the color came back in the blood
you know was still flowing and stuff
even though we didn't end up
highlighting just like the risk of there
being a tiny bit of color in that we had
a bit of time to play with so we kind of
reknowned my lip so I wouldn't feel it
as much yeah we highly is there and you
know didn't really like feel like much I
still felt the exact same because like I
said I wasn't in any pain initially
anyway so we did that and then we knew
that that was like the most we could do
for now and that would dissolve you know
any filler that was stuck in the vessel
and it would do its job and just solve
any possible problems if there was any
so I basically
home that night I was very so I had to
say very socks
obviously like all the trauma to my lip
and I went home Jodi was amazing like
checked up on me every single day and I
did go back I think I went back to
morning's on the chart so we agreed that
I would go back the next morning
obviously just to check up on it so
hello Cain again the only thing that was
a little bit concerning if there was one
area on the inside of my lip which was
very white and this was another thing
about my lips it was kind of hard to
Jewish because one thing that Jodie's I
always said like said from day one as
well like before any of this even
happened my lips are naturally very pale
so it's kind of hard to know sometimes
like when like something doesn't look
quite right or when it's like actually
just my lip because they are quite pale
especially like on the inside as well
yeah so I went back the next morning and
we injected Hayley's again because there
was kind of an issue on the inside of my
lip and also down my chin and Jodi said
that she thought like it was kind of
tracking down my chin here which is
obviously lies below the spot where we
had the issue so she injected again and
that really was really quite so even
though we obviously Nam dit again it
really was so kinda by that point like
so we re injected and then basically I
went the next moment again and we were
actually going to inject again which my
face was just like no i cant resis but
she actually kind of she was discussing
obvious like this whole time this hasn't
as well she was discussing with a lot of
other people like what to do and like
their opinions on the situation and
things like that just so that you know
we had multiple opinions from lots of
people who have so much like experience
as well as Jodi and we just decided like
not stew again we were like it's
absolutely fine like comparison sorry
it's like slow compared to what other
people's lips look like when there's
been like a serious occlusion as well
like mine just looked fine they were we
just said we basically decided that the
white inside of my lip was actually like
from a bruise like it was just so
bruised around the area we were like you
know what we're just being paranoid it's
absolutely fine it's gonna be fine and
so then it was just a case of allowing
it to heal so basically we agreed that I
would send Jodi pictures and like videos
of my lips every single morning for the
next week so she genuinely texts me
every morning she was like hey hon how
you looks doing all over and that's just
like again one of the things that just
is so important because like the
aftercare like the support from
afterwards like after the whole
situation like you know you just know
you just know you're in good hands it's
good so I got up every single morning
and I took pictures of it and then I
basically video like all the area
underneath which is where we initially
felt there was a bit of like an issue
and then I had videos like the whole
inside of the lip and I sent it's where
every single morning and every single
morning it just got better and better
and it healed and it was absolutely fine
like by the end of the week it was still
a bit bruised and a little bit like
green and discolored from like the
bruising but it was absolutely fine a
lot as we were having with me when I had
what we believe is like a partial vessel
occlusion it kind of been like a
properly full one because we managed to
like rectify the whole thing so quickly
and I say we like I was also at work
doing it well obviously it was all Jody
one thing we realized as well obviously
like I said this is such a rare thing to
happen like it's not common to someone
to like have a vessel occlusion like
it's just so rare and so we kind of
started like thinking about I was like
why this happened to me and it kind of
came to my attention that when I was
about 13 or so I had an accident on a
trampoline in high school which oh my
god this is a completely different
forest but the worst day of my life I
swear but honestly sued Moscow Springs
because I basically was left unattended
in a trampoline lesson and I practiced a
front flip and I split the hole I
basically practice this on flip over
rotated landed on might like jaw area
here pretty much on my face and I split
my entire jaw it was honestly disgusting
like it's enough to make me vomit but
yeah I will show you that but I still
have a lot of scarring from where that
had to be stitched up I had to have like
needles and stuff there's a lot of blood
it was like such a trauma to my like
lower mouth region and I think like that
must have honestly contributed because
when we actually started like getting
looking at like the sort of ass reasons
jog around like my very like lower kind
of jaw and lower lip area they must have
sort of like changed since then because
they are like really quite prominent now
which obviously like I just never
thought that that would ever affect
anything like this and but it's just so
important to just like be aware of stuff
it's happy
like to you in the past I guess because
of that Jody basically decided not to
inject my lips like the usual way
anymore so when I got them refilled I
didn't have like a normal sort of like
you know the injections across all like
my lip and stuff she did it with a
cannula a saline it's soft so a cannula
is basically a blunt needle and you
basically do one each side like
obviously do them individually but you
basically insert like a sharp needle to
create like obvious like the pacing and
the entrance to the blunt needle and and
then you insert the body that's quite
long it goes to about halfway in your
lip I know it sounds so gross and
honestly like I was a bit freaked out
test as well and because it's a blunt
needle there is basically no chance like
no chance of any issues happening with
like vessels and things like that so we
just decided it was a lot you know safer
and more appropriate for me to have it
that way and so yeah but yeah that is
the method that we are pretty much using
from now on I have to say like I didn't
really love it so it's kind of a quite a
weird sensation it didn't like her too
much but it just feels weird like
actually I probably prefer having the
needle work done but obviously like to
the benefit of safety and making sure
that my lips stay fine it's obviously
worth doing so again links back to
making sure that you go to someone who
knows what they're doing and you know
can help you with other methods and just
you know support you when things maybe
don't go wrong and don't by the way that
you want them to go because it can't
happen like it can happen with aliens
it's like cosmetic surgery well yeah I
feel like especially now especially now
that this is happening I just would not
want to go to anyone other than Judy
because I know she can handle a
situation if anything goes wrong I know
she creates a shape and stuff and does
my lips I like them and it's like she
provides so much support and care like
it's just so important but yeah I hope
you all enjoyed this video or found it
useful it's hopefully I don't know
hopefully you've learned something from
it or it's like informed you a little
bit if you're considering getting lip
fillers or anything of the sort dawn

you guys from moon about a million times
over
