channel and hello hi if you're new here
welcome my name is Holly Boone so
today's video I'm gonna do the 0 to 100
makeup thing that everyone does
I always watch someone really love those
videos so everyone's doing myself also
I'm just sitting on my bed from this
video so I want it to be a little bit
more chill that's why the background is
different I actually quite liked the
setup here as well because the light
ends seems to be better I've got I've
got a break out here because it's that
time of the month and yeah anyway so the
first thing I'm gonna do is my eyebrows
I'm gonna use my NYX micro brow pencil
in the show black I was using that PI my
crap pencil and I went to apartment the
other day and got some more firm up
makeup and it wasn't in there like it's
gone and I asked the woman I was like do
you have that brow like that twisting up
brow pen center she was like she didn't
know what was talking about that's so
annoying was that province it was very
good but the next one is my favors well
and then this one isn't expensive either
so it's all good see I'm just gonna
either on my eyebrow and then I'm gonna
follow the natural shape of my brows
where on the top okay then once I've
done that I'm just gonna lightly go
through the brow sometimes I put brow
gel in before and sometimes I just go
straight in with the brow pencil if my
eyebrow hairs are looking a bit crazy
like sometimes they curl down and
they're just where I've like slept funny
they're like stick out and stuff like
that way I will put a little bit of gel
in them before I apply this product but
they've been alright today and then but
to start my Brown gonna go really really
lightly and I quite like to keep a few
little sparse areas cuz I think you know
makes it looking a bit more natural and
then I'm going to take my anastacio
Beverly Hills brow gel and then comb
through them so then where I go through
with the gel where I left a few sparse
areas I think it looks it makes it look
a little bit more natural in a bit more
detailed I just prefer that so if you
guys get what I mean but you know I'm
the worst explaining things I think this
might have to be the new place where I
film
because delighting I'm looking in there
I always look in the little screen I'm
sorry if that's really annoying but I
always have to check my focus because so
many times I've gone to edit my videos
and I've been out fakers and I always
like to check the light and but it looks
so much better and when I have a
backdrop so this might have to be the
new setup okay so I'm gonna carve up my
Brown I've been using my Bible under I
from it cosmetics recently for my
eyeshadow base and I really like it so
I'm gonna just put some stuff over my
hand this is in the shade medium tan and
I'm gonna use my Mac 195 brush which is
this flat synthetic brush
you
so I'm gonna bring it all the way down
and all the way over the lid as well
boom boom shake the room so I'm
gonna put a little bit of powder on top
of that I know those people who are like
don't do that because you don't get so
much fat color payoff quite have to
avoid my I show just does not stay I'm
gonna be trying the pillow is actually a
base and the palette which I can't wait
for so sorry I know it's gonna be so
amazing and I think that's gonna be like
my new favorite I don't know base this
sponge is the Sigma sponge by the way
and I just used my Laura Mercier
translucent powder I'm going to try this
dose of colors palette and this is a
sassy Siena's pilot this is my kind of
palette like I love these sort of colors
on my eyes so I'm going to try that out
today I used the other one the other day
the women like the berry colors in it
and I posted that one on Instagram I
love that one so they're very pigmented
eyeshadow is some exciting to use it's
Amazon so I'm gonna go through this
color first of all I'm going to use
these three colors here so I'm gonna go
with this one first and as you can see
it picks up so much color and I'm gonna
apply this just above my crease my eye
and we do light it with circular motions
bringing it all the way in as well all
the way into the inner corner of the eye
and then all the way out I'm going to
put it all the way out as and like past
my actual eye because I want it to look
seamless we're going to clean it up I
don't need to just randomly like stop
here so I'm gonna pull it all the way up
did I say what bottom using Mac 284 if I
didn't already tell you the thing with
Mike brushes they do last you so long
I've got Mac brushes that I've had for
years and they're still in perfect
condition I've washed them so many times
so they are an investment they are
expensive but they will last you years
and using the in years so now I'm going
to use this color and I'm going to use
my blank canvas a 42 brush I'm going to
apply this shade in the crease and the
outer corner of the eye these blank
canvas brushes as well
love these I've only recently got a few
of these and I loved them I got them off
beautybay I'm also gonna bring this all
the way in as well and then I'm gonna go
back to my Mac to t4 why'd you bend that
edge look at me my health and fitness
towel when I use it for makeup sit down
I'm gonna go with the dark shade and
this is my blank canvas e 10 brushes the
route I need or fluffy Brighton and I'm
gonna apply this the outer corner and
again I'm gonna bring it all the way in
because I'm gonna cut my crease and when
I cut my crease I still want you to be
able to see the dark color all the way
around the eye so I'm very much my blank
canvas II thought you tooth brush and
the shape we just used before I'm gonna
go over that edge now I'm gonna go to my
Mac 2 to 4 let me know if you guys
prefer the light in of me sitting here
rather than with a backdrop or if you
prefer it with the backdrop let me know
okay so I'm gonna use some of that it
cosmetics concealer Bible under eye I'm
going to cut my crease I'm using the
same brush the Mac one on 5 brush
okay I'm gonna just set that over a
little bit of powder I'm using the laura
mercier powder again and this Sigma
sponge I find it really difficult trying
to get them really even I'm gonna go
back to the second from darkest shade
this one on this blank canvas a 42 brush
I'm gonna lightly go over the edge I'm
really the same on the other side and
I'm gonna go to the dark darker shade a
mighty 10 brush the same thing reunited
a so I'm gonna just keep the cut crease
just concealer I'm not gonna pay
anything on top of it I want to keep the
whole up Matt and I would say really
like how it came out I don't want to put
a collar on top I am just gonna put a
little bit more powder up because I
don't want it to look shiny see I'm just
putting a bit more we're besties powder
so when we need now is I'm going to
apply some black eyeliner across my lash
line and I'm going to smudge it and
smoke it out a little bit so I'm going
to use my Sigma gel liner and my eo6
winged liner brush from Sigma as well
and I'm gonna place it on the lash line
I'm going to keep it a little bit
thicker on the outer corner and I'm
going to keep it really thin towards the
inner corner and I'm gonna put this in
my top waterline as well it's gonna help
when you bent to bend in your eyelashes
so if you wear fake lashes and if you
don't think I should it helps to make
your lashline it so I'm gonna use my
zoeva two three two luxe classic shader
brush this is normally a brush I would
apply okay Shay drove the lid but I like
this for smudging the liner so I'm just
gonna pull the eye and I'm just gonna
run this back and forth
I've got liner so you don't have to be
overly neat when I find this liner cause
obviously you want to smudge it anyway
but you just want to keep the outer
corner a bit thicker than the inner
corner oh you don't want to do it too
thick in the inner corner so
I'm gonna pull the eyelid and then just
run this brush over there I know enough
ice to mascara
I'm gonna use my bandage yeah bad guy
Alabam those of you picked up on how I
say it but I just can't say it normal I
always have to say it like an idiot
so I'm gonna apply some other okay so
for last year's I've got this book that
Morton gave me which is like where you
can put your store all your like used
eyelashes which I love because I used to
just put them in a box and she's getting
so like messed up and stuck together so
I love this and I have pretty much all
Coco dashes and more then it's my faves
I don't know where to dub them some up
because I want this to be like quite a
Mike I've got these like longer not as
dramatic ones which I probably gonna put
on top of the Coker ones but I cannot
remember the name of these for the life
of me they're just like random me in
that book but I cannot remember it's
really annoying okay so I'm gonna apply
the lash glue to the lashes and leave
them to dry down for a little bit
like I always do and I probably will
forget about them it happens every time
a reason the House of lashes eyelash
glue and this one I'm using is the black
one and I love House of lashes eyelash
gray is the best it's the best I don't
want to hear no juggler in the comment
section we don't do duo glue over here
okay
choooo glue is cancelled it was
cancelled years ago we don't we don't
discuss it we don't talk about it we
don't even mention it the D word just
does not come on this channel okay so
I'm gonna pass on my Marc Jacobs
remarkable coconut primer I'm gonna put
some on the back of my hand and I'm
gonna use my Mac it's like a mini
stipple brush the numbers rubbed off
I've had it for years and I'm just gonna
use this to apply just primer got those
spots so so cuz I've been picking them
and you should never do that cuz I'm
gonna stab that now I just can't help
myself sometimes
I'm then going to apply some of the
Porefessional Matt rescue from
benneferre I'm going to pass on this in
my t-zone and also where my pores are so
just size of my nose area my foundation
I'm going to use my Estee Lauder Double
Wear and I'm going to actually apply it
with my NYX oh three brush because I've
not tried applying this foundation with
a brush yet so I want to see what the
difference is I wish you'd sponge
okay I like the way it's applying it
with the foundation it's not absorbing
as much product as the sponge is like
it's covering a lot of area with only a
small like product whereas when I use a
sponge I use up way more product because
the sponge like absorbs half of it
so I'm gonna stick my lashes on before I
do actually yeah so when I set the Coco
are more luscious first okay so now I'm
just gonna apply another pair just
because I just want to be that bitch you
know it's gonna be extra as so we
wouldn't apply the other parent up this
is a hard part I find
oh sorry I love it okay these lashes
look so crazy right now but I think it's
because I haven't done like my under-eye
area so just bear with I feel like it'll
come together so I'm gonna take my Becca
under eye brightening corrector I'm
gonna apply a little bit of this under
my eyes this is so good for counting out
dark circles because if I just apply
concealer sometimes my dark circles
still show through and I'm gonna use my
sponge my feet you render when this in
and then I would ease my makeup
revolution concealer in to find in the
shade c5
I'm going to bring it up downsize my
nose
okay so I'm going to use my Beauty
Blender spins then most of you guys keep
asking if I'm going to try out the
makeup revision stick foundation and I
definitely will if you guys want me to
and the only reason I happen is because
I feel like I've reviewed so many
foundation sticks that you know I didn't
want it to get a bit boring like I've
done L'Oreal one and did the iconic
London versus the hourglass as well so
you didn't know if you guys were like oh
god no not another foundation review
stick foundation but and I'd rather it
be more of a review rather than a first
impression so what I might do is get the
foundation try out for a month or
something and then make you guys know I
think peso except my under I'm going to
use my Primark banana powder I've been
using this a lot recently I need the
tiniest amount but I really like it so
I'm just putting a tiny bit on the end
of my son
then her pie a little bit in between my
brows I'm with forehead as well next I'm
gonna cream bronze I'm gonna use my NYX
foundation stick in the shade rich
sometimes I use my iconic London one so
lovely is this one I just kind of switch
it up I like them both and then I'm
going to use this brush which I used to
apply the foundation which is the NYX oh
three brush I love cream bronzer under
noron so it makes so much difference
okay so let's finish with my under eyes
because I'm looking hella crazy right
now so putting nothing under my eyes
it's like stay weird so we take this
shade right here my Mac two to four
brush first when it comes down to
concealers cruising under my eyes
I feel like pretty much every single
concealer crease is because I have not
to crease it under my eyes but when I
apply shadow underneath the eye you
can't tell anyway the shadow disguises
it so yeah I feel like it's fine then
I'm gonna go for this shade on my efj
what's a blank canvas brush same on the
other side so now I'm gonna go for my
e10 brush and the darkest color I'm
gonna keep this as Christ in the lash
line as possible don't want to bring
this one down too far I think my Sigma
Carolina I'm gonna put this in at my
bottom waterline and I'm gonna bring it
slightly underneath as well and then we
smudge it out in a sec then using my two
three to lock shader brush from zoeva
I'm gonna smudge now love it I love a
good smoky eye but like it's such a sexy
artwork it's like insane and look at me
look at my sexy smoky eye
this makes my bottom lashes so long I'm
gonna use my Mac mineralize skinfinish
in the shade dark do
and this fluffy brush from NYX this is
neat 21 brush love this brush it's so
good for bronzer so I'm gonna apply some
blush I'm going to use this gold rush
palette from Primark which has like two
highlights and two brush actually one
bronze on one blush I'm gonna use this
shade here which is called blaze and
this brush is from Kiko it's very
pigmented blush I really like it this
part of it was only like five pound yeah
I'm going to use this shade to highlight
out of this palette I love it I love it
it's so thick I'm gonna spray where's my
tray I'm going to spray my brush with
the mac fix+
okay so lastly we're gonna do lips I'm
going to use mine exit by night in the
shade London
okay so we're going to use one of my OD
right or die lip colors which I
used to wear this all the time it's just
so nice and that's the MAC lipstick in
the show peach stock it's like why did I
stop wearing this I love there so I'm
gonna go back to my lip liner and just
blend it in
you could either leave it like this
which looks nice
oh he can be me and are they lip gloss
because I always had a lip gloss
I used to use there was one from Mac
that used to wear with this like buzz I
think it was cool and I used to be
obsessed peach talk and write bars was
my ride-or-die
but I'm gonna use my pro mic one cuz I
love this and this is the perfect shiny
lip gloss and it's in the shade stay in
peachy
then I'm going to spray some fixed glass
just to get rid of any excess powder
make me look nice and dewy okay so I'm
gonna do my hair I'm just gonna do a bun
because I really like how it looks I
feel like it really shows off the makeup
when I have my hair up so I'm gonna just
do not hurt fun it's so quick to do as
well the only problem I feel like when I
trying to have fun when I've just washed
my hair it just doesn't go it's good
like it goes better with my hair's a bit
greasy do not omit when you've just
washed your hair it's so soft just
doesn't do the same thing so I'm gonna
twist me pony twist me ponytail like
this I'm gonna wrap it around it's as
tight as possible to make it myself and
my grade and I'm gonna just put the hair
bound and tied up hmm I like to
sometimes put a little bit of hair down
like that I just seemed you out which
our partnership doesn't avoid at the bun
but anyway and see I did she just like
Twitter the hair wrap it around but have
I found it and I like to put a mix of
hair down so I think it makes it look a
little bit Messier and I like it
everyone always ask to wake up my hips
like I just pay literally things like to
pound one part like whenever on some
when I see hoops I will just stock up
because I always lose them but I've got
always in a reason like one and it's so
annoying so I just yeah
whenever I'm about and I just see any
like river island Topshop prime up bitch
name it's anywhere also pretty little
thing have good hoops and they're not
very expensive so that is the finished
look I hope you guys enjoyed this
