down have a chat with you just basically
about the fact that I reach 200
subscribers I actually can't believe it
so I just wanted to sit down and say
thank you and just have a little chat
and I'm obsessed with these sunglasses
I'm living in these sunglasses right now
or whether my all the time
they're from want her watch over on
Instagram I'll tag them but I for want
to get some but actually meant hit them
off using a ring light in the reflection
it's kind of annoying but yeah I just
want to sit down and say thank you
because I didn't I was gonna plan
something like I gave a why or something
like that
when I reached 100,000 and it came
around so quick I didn't expect it like
I was on like 95 thousand then I just
didn't expect to reach 100,000 so quick
so what I did I was actually like so
unorganized I was like holy like I
thought it would be like the Lisa off a
month or something before I reached
200,000 so I'm gonna do a giveaway at
some point by I'm gonna patch them
myself it's not gonna be free stuff it's
gonna be stuff that I purchased just
because I really want to give back to
you guys and just say thank you because
I never actually thought I would ever
get hundred thousand subscribers like
it's actually crazy to me like I
remember when I first started I mind it
she thought I would have like five
thousand at the most like ten thousand
if I was lucky but I never ever ever
thought it would go it would go as well
so I'm so happy and I'm so grateful
because I get to do something I
absolutely love and it's like part of my
job now because obviously I don't know
if you guys know but you have like
Google Adsense and things and then you
get like paid hub adverts on your videos
and stuff so it's actually part of my
job now which is so cool like for me to
get sit down and create makeup blokes
and talk to you guys as part of my job
is like the best job ever I like I
literally can't wait till the day after
not to have it full time and just if you
do this full time and the way when I do
back part time job but this is like my
main income so hopefully by the end of
the year I'll be doing YouTube full-time
and but yeah I'm so grateful I'm so
happy
and I honestly can't thank you enough
and don't we know what else to say I was
gonna film like a ring my subscribers
video sorry the hairbrush turn it off
the bed and yeah I was gonna film like
covering my subscribers but I was so
nervous that I'd be scared to do that
yeah I'd be really scared that I'm quite
nervous when I meet new people and wanna
speak to new people or like it scares me
so I'm actually quite shy like when you
first meet me a lot people see me in
real life and they don't come and say
hello they like she just mentioned feels
natural like I saw each day I didn't
know how to say hello or not like if you
ever see me in person please come and
talk to me I do have a resting bitch
face now I look like I'm moody all the
time but I'm honestly not like I am a
friendly person
I'm quite shy as well so you don't have
to Pho intimidate everybody at all so
please if you see we come and say hello
but every no ass to say I just wanted to
say thank you so this is like a really
short video I think that is all I needed
to say hopefully one day we'll get to a
million I know that's a big goal but I
can see myself in say three years or
four years getting to a million so so I
say thank you so much and um I love you
all so thank you and that's everything
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
