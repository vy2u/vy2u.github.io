channel if you're new here hi welcome hi
hello hi hi hi my name is honey bee so
today I thought it'd be a cool idea to
compare two foundations as you guys know
I love the elastic foundation I
literally love it but it's so expensive
and you don't get like hardly any
products which is solanine so I thought
why not try out the iconic London
pigment stick again foundation I used it
for foundation age years ago and I found
they were snipper on my face but since
then I found out what works for me in
regards to cream foundations I have to
set my primer and I have to set my
contour if I died it will slide around
he's the exact same with the hourglass
one but after something I've learned
over time that works for me so I thought
why not give this another go and try
this verse is this so one side of my
face I'm going to do the hourglass and
then the other side of my face and wind
you the iconic London pigment stick okay
so the hourglass stick foundation you
get 7.2 grams of the product for 42
pounds which is obviously so expensive
and then with the iconic London pigment
stick you get eight grams of product for
$24.99 $24.99 so obviously there is a
massive difference in price so I just
want to see there's a massive difference
in the finish of the foundation if we
can see if there's much difference at
all
so first thing I'm going to do is prime
west skin I'm going to take my selfie
ready blur prime are from Primark for
the sense of my face just to blow my
pores
I'm just gonna place right in the center
here see how it's just really interested
I was going to see there's much
difference in the two because I used it
I kind of got London whatl cream bronzer
all the time and pretty much try as a
foundation you're gonna just see her as
much difference between hourglass than
that one so we're gonna see today and
then for the rest of my face I'm gonna
use my glam glow this is the map glow
moisturizer I love this stuff so yeah I
found that over time from using cream
foundations I realized that I need to
stop my primer because if I don't it
kind of slides around my face throughout
the dome let's make my translucent
powder from Beauty bakery
we're gonna set the primer that
moisturizes by the way sounds like
Terry's chocolate orange loose mouth I'm
really trying it lick the tub it's gonna
take some translucent powder on this
fluffy brush from next this is the oh
three brush I'm just going to tap off
the excess because I don't want too much
and then I'm just gonna powder my face
before the foundation so yeah this is
something that I have to do if your oily
like me and you find that cream punish
you just do not last throughout the day
or they kind of slide around the face
and try this technique because it
definitely works for me anyway and also
I feel like it applies the cream stick a
lot nicer as well when I've set my
primer so I've just zoomed you right in
all the way in so we can really see
what's going on so I'm gonna use the
elastic foundation on this side like I
said and then the iconic condom pigment
stick on this side with the elastic
foundation I use the shade of golden tan
and the nearest match in the iconic
London pigment stick I found is the
shade 2.1 so i'll just show you the
comparison I mean they're not the exact
same there's a slight difference but
they are pretty similar so first we're
going to take the hourglass stick
Foundation and we're going to do this on
my face
I start breaking out this side I don't
know why and then we're gonna apply the
iconic London pigment stick on this side
and to show you two point one which yeah
is slightly darker so I'm gonna take I
did think miss so I'm gonna head to a
three point three as well and I'm gonna
kind of run the two together on this
side I'm going to use a pink sponge and
on this side I'm gonna use my green
sponge so I'm gonna blend in the
hourglass fast so the hourglass blends
in really nicely and and it feels really
nice fulness again it's just the price
like I just the price of it is just so
ridiculous and then on this side I'm
gonna blend this in with the iconic one
okay so iconic London one is blended and
really nice as well I'm not like
struggling to blend it in so that's good
so the difference in shade is that this
side is a lot more golden yellow and
this side is a little bit more I don't
know I'd say this side probably matches
me better to be honest and then this
side this side is a little bit darker
because I am oiling I actually kind of
prefer this side because it's not as
like I said it's not as creamy so at the
moment I can't see a huge difference
coverage is exactly the same both of
them blend out really nicely
I'm quite shocked I'm not gonna lie
because I didn't expect the icon under
one to be as creamy as it is like it's
not as creamy as this one but it does
but not noisy doesn't stick do you not I
mean I some creams I find you apply and
it sticks and you comprehend it out but
I mean it's been doing really nicely and
the finish is really nice I'm not gonna
lie there's not really a huge difference
do you not I mean like considering that
this one's the iconic ones $24.99 and
this was 42 pounds like considering the
price range compared to the actual
difference in the actual foundation it's
not there's not that much to me not that
much so I'm going to take my makeup
revolution concealer in the shade c5 you
just under my eyes we're going to see
how the concealer blends in with each
foundation but yeah I hadn't tried this
stick for foundation in the longest time
because I kind of went off cream
foundations and then I just because this
was 40 deposit automatic you put a bit
better but yeah I'm a little bit sure
come on time so I'm gonna take my green
sponge for this side we're gonna bend it
in see how it blends in really really
nicely with the foundation definitely
and then we'll take this sponge with
this side
it's rendered in nicely okay I think
that looks really good both sides being
BIOS Isaac really good like I said
there's really not a huge difference at
all
at all so I'm gonna use my makeup
revolution concealer in the shade c14 to
contour I'm gonna see how this blends in
with the foundation so again this side
I'm gonna use this sponge
okay that's rendered in nicely sometimes
I have a little bit of fooled by price I
used to think like our more expensive
products are going to be better because
that's then what expensive but the more
I kind of learn about stuff I realized
that you kind of just pay for the
packaging rather than the actual product
so if you're going for a high-end brand
you're normally just paying for the
brand name or the packaging because
packaging is way more expensive than the
product so yeah again it's Brendan in
fine
okay so the concert blended in really
nicely on both sides this side is just a
little bit more and then this side this
sides a little bit lighter that's just
the colors of the foundation and the
coverage is exactly the same I just felt
like they look exactly the same
I really am aghast at the finish and the
texture of the foundation the only
difference is this like the slight
difference in color and what does that
one beat your bakery translucent powder
and we're going to set the concealer
under my eyes so I'm going to use the
green sponge on this side again so I'm
gonna take this hold I just set under my
eyes
and then I'm gonna set my chin and I'm
just gonna set just above my brow hair
cuz I do you get quite really in the
area and then I'm going to use the pink
sponge for the other side
so I'm gonna take my Anasazi Beverly
Hills contour palette
let's hit the darker shade which is the
shade right here on this NYX fluffy
brush it's the same as the one that I
use for powder but it's a different one
since this one I'm gonna just go over
where I applied the cream con saw you
see how it looks there where this
foundation throughout the day so both
sides and we're gonna I'll come back in
like five hours and that you know who I
think I'm gonna see which so I guess
really at first I really feel like this
side is probably gonna get really fast
because this side that is creamier than
that side so I really don't feel like
hardly any difference honestly I'm
actually very shocked because I love
this hourglass stick foundation but like
I said the price of it just really puts
me off because it's like I run out of it
so fast and I'm just like I really want
to buy it again tonight I mean so the
iconic one is 8 grams and $24.99 and
this is 7.2 grams and you get this one's
40 pounds so yeah and honestly I really
see much difference at all
I don't know if you guys can tell but I
really cannot tell a soul like at all
this is up closer this side is iconic
and this side is hourglass yeah what the
 we just finished the rest of my
face up camera I just did my hair and I
honestly do not see any difference at
all honestly I really don't let me know
if you guys see any difference I've read
a see any difference but at all at first
I felt like this I loved it more creamy
more dewy this I Drive down a little bit
more matte I want saying matte but like
semi matte which is what I prefer
because I am oily and but then once I
said everything I feel like everything
just looks the same I mean you won't be
able to say oh she's got you know a 42
pave Foundation on that sign a 25 pound
foundation on that side so I mean yeah
let me know in the comments if you see
any difference I've been wasting my
money I've been wasting money
I'm just I'm a bit mad I'm a bit mad
that I didn't use that sooner because
yeah anyway I will see you in a few
hours time and I'll check in and you see
what it's like so I do corny throughout
the day so we'll see which side gets
more shiny and just see how it wears if
it lasts or stuff like that so I will
see you in a few hours oh my god
if you've not had the monkey bar
crashing from KFC you need to try it
hey guys so I am back and it's been
about five and a half hours roughly five
and a half to six hours and honesty the
foundation still looks really really
good I've got the tiniest little bit of
creasing around my mouth on both sides
and but that always happens anyway if
I'm laughing or from whatever and then
I'm a little bit showing it on my chin
but apart from that I just I kind of
believe that this side is for cutie pies
and this side is $24.99 I like I feel
like you just would not even be able to
tell at all like at all but yeah I hope
