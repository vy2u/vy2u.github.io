filming a look using the new anastasia
beverly hills modern renaissance palette
i'm absolutely obsessed with this
palette like i literally can't get
enough of it i've been wearing it like
every single day so first of all to
prime my eye i'm going to use the Mac
soft ochre Paint Pot and I'm just
applying that using the mac 242 brush so
first of all I'm going to take the shade
raw Sienna I'm pretty saying these
shades wrong but I'll give it a go
anyway so I'm just going to apply that
in the crease using my fluffy brush this
is my transition color
they're next I'm just going to take
shade burnt-orange
and I'm gonna take my fluffy brush and
apply this in the crease
all the bands are what you feelin from a
show
so next using the brush from that comes
with the palette I'm just going to take
the shade realgar I probably said that
completely wrong I well and then
I'm just going to take the fluffy end of
that brush and just blend that in
so now I'm just going to take shade red
ocher I'm just going to apply this again
all over the lid and then just blend
that in with the fluffy brush
okay so now taking the really light
shade from the palette I have in the top
left hand corner I can't say it so I'm
like I'm going to try and say it but I'm
just going to provide some of that to my
brow bone
okay so now taking ingridt gel liner in
77 which is matte black I'm just going
to wing my liner and this is the zoeva
winged liner brush
okay so from Escarra i'm going to take
my blush mascara by the balm and then
flashes i'm going to be using the huge
Beauty lana lashes so for primer I'm
going to use a Smashbox primer water and
then after that I'm just going to apply
some of the Becca backlight filter as
well just because this gives like a real
nice dewy finish to the skin and so I'm
just applying that using a foundation
brush so just feel like it goes on nicer
and then for foundation I'm going to be
using the Giorgio Armani luminous silk
foundation and this is in shade 6.5 and
then I'm just going to apply that with
my Beauty Blender
so I'm actually going to be using the
new Too Faced Born This Way concealer I
love this product I've used it now three
or four times and I am obsessive it
doesn't crease it's really good coverage
it's kind of like mediums full coverage
it's actually quite full coverage
actually and I do apply quite a lot cuz
I like it full coverage and but it's
really really nice it doesn't crease or
anything I'm not any problems with it
and I don't really have anything bad to
say about it at all so definitely one of
my new absolute favorites
so now I'm just going to take my laura
mercier translucent setting powder and
just set that just to make sure it
doesn't crease and also I'm just going
to bake much in because I am quite oily
and then I'm going to go in with the
eyeliner just go over that make sure
that I cover up all the glue and it's
just nice and black I'm also going to
run some of that in my top also line as
well it just makes it blend a lot nicer
and then just taking my Sigma highlight
brush I'm just going to dust off the
excess powder and I do have a courage
Holly that you can use for Sigma to get
money off on the website then I'm just
going to take my Mac gives me some
bronzer and this duo fiber brush by
Sigma again I'm just going to warm up my
face because I look like an absolute
ghost and and then I am going to go in
with the Taylor blue Console kit shade
six and just contour my cheekbones my
forehead and along my jaw line
so now I'm going to go in with this
blusher by Sigma I'm not really sure the
name of this but I will link it in the
description box below and like I said
you can use code Holley for money off
and this brush is from the vanity planet
brush kit sorry now it's finished off my
eyes I'm just going to smoke out my
lower lash line so I'm just going in
with shade realgar festival and just
applying the underneath and then on top
I'm just going to apply a shade red
ochre I'm not sure if I've said those
names right or not but oh well I'm then
going to take the Inglot gel liner and
just apply this in my waterline and then
apply some mascara to my bottom lashes
I'm then just going to take shade
Vermeer I think that's how you say it
and I was going to highlight my brow
bone and the inner corner of my eye
so now for highlighter I'm taking the
Kiko eyeshadow in two away I'm upset you
obsessed with this and this fan brush is
from the vanity panic brush kit
so lastly for my lips I'm taking the
Kylie Jenner this is a lip gloss in like
and that is the finished look guys I
