gonna be filming a haul video hence the
title I don't know why I always say what
I'm gonna film because it says what I'm
gonna film but you know
so basically I'm supposed to talk to you
guys about this because I like don't let
me do whole videos but this you just
like something I need to talk to you
guys about it's just insane so basically
if you are from the UK or any other
country how hard is it to get products
from America like I feel like at the
u.s. the USA have literally every single
make a ranch you can ever think of but
they have so much and in the UK it's
like we don't have anything like we
don't have anything good that's like we
do have good stuff but we don't really
have a lot of choice in my opinion we
don't have tar we don't have Kat Von D
we don't have a necessity move your
heels don't have we don't have anything
so it's just really really annoying
trying to get certain products basically
I came across this website called go
send and what it is it's basically a
shipping company in America it's like a
personal shopper and what it is is
basically if you're from the UK or any
other country and you want to order
stuff from America and thanks for the
thing ups are for things like that if
you order things like four separate
websites and stuff it can be really
expensive obviously with shipping and
stuff what they do is they are a
personal shopper brands so we use you go
on the website you create an account you
basically go on every individual website
where you want something from you take
the link you put it on this little thing
on the website on guys then you put the
link in what shade you want or what
color or what size anything like that
you put it in the little description
they raise it you list all the products
that you want send it off and then
someone from goes end
shops it all for you like gets it all
for you and then basically sends it out
to you in one big box so you only pay
for one off shipping you're not paying
for those it's like individual shipping
also like don't make what you do is you
make okay they make you like a fake
address so it basically it gets said to
them and then what happens is they wish
you ship it out to you you then apply
your dress in addition for out to you
which is really really good also on
there they've got like you know like the
shopping bed they've got steals and
stuff so I managed to get
Carli bybel palette and for $14 which in
the UK is probably about 10 pounds just
because it's been on sale they've got
really really good deals and stuff like
they list all the stuff we can get good
deals it's just really good luck I think
it's such an amazing way to be able to
for us usually things to be able to get
American products without spending loads
and loads of money what they do is it
should be chop it for you then send it
out and all we have to do is basically
pay one lot of shipping instead of like
loads of into individual bits of
shipping which is really really cool I
just think it's like a really really
amazing way for us to people in the UK
spear with purchased certain things
because I you know what you know me I
have struggled with this for so long
because we don't have anything in the UK
we don't have Sephora or anything so
it's just a nightmare for us
so I'm sorry really got that finest
website and what I will do is link the
website below I'll also link all the
products I got in the description box
below in case you guys want to purchase
them I'm like yes I finally found
something where I can actually get
American products and not spend those
money or ship in so you guys are like
mini even I love it this is the first
thing that I've got is the Carli bybel
palette coz on their website if you go
on the go shopping bit it came up with
the Carli bybel palette for $14 so I was
like yes I need that look I tries to get
in ages ago when it first came out and
obviously like it's sold out so quick
she's got so many subscribers and fans
and stuff so it's sold out so fast I was
unable to get it so you've got ten on
shadows and then for highlighters
obviously you can use the highlighters
in size of this as well dr. gorgeous
palette I'm up to your since it's really
pigmented like for $14 it's so pigmented
I'm absolutely obsessed so they's the
first thing that I've got the Carli
bybel palette I will be doing like the
first impressions or I was shootin a
tutorial so the next thing that I got
was this Tarte palette now I love top
cause my eggs but again it's so hard to
get in the UK so I'm gonna take full
advantage of this go same website and
I'm just gonna order from the only time
now so this is they this is called
double duty palette this is it is sorry
okay
but you reach my needs some really nice
shimmers and it's on a matte shades we
have many colors like that like I love
that color
have any colors like that this is green
i ii Ferranti gold shade just between us
I love this shade as well just try that
the other one that I got with these
harlot in bloom palette I like this for
so don't quite me tell you guys I want
this size I said this as I thought oh it
sounds like I need to get it so I almost
asked okay a young guy why I'm obsessed
when I open it the packaging is so
pretty as well I is so cute I love it
these are the item a is like put
somewhere eyes today through wonder and
I use that one for my brow bone use this
one for transition this one in the
crease that one in the crease as well
and then that one on the outer corner
and then this one over the lid mix of a
little bit of those two bitches love it
it's just beautiful and it smells so
good
thanks know about with the shade and
light palette by Kat Von D I have some
amazing things about this palette I've
seen a lot of youtubers use this we will
actually swear by this is like the best
contour palette so I had to obviously
check it out my Kat Von D is coming to
Def names in the UK online I'm not sure
in store probably in store as well
Devon ins anyway pretty soon I think I
think it's quite soon as she's coming
because how many products will be in
double image I'm not sure specific dates
but I'm so excited for that is gonna be
amazed this is it the contour palette
you guys are pretty seeing this on
YouTube but I see what this shade here
which is like a banana shade you put
it's kind of like peachy undertone
you're showing here and then it's
obviously just more like the lighter
shade and then you've got a three
obviously point or shades here like
medium and dark I use this today
actually I use this one mixed with a bit
of that one contour it's very good how
is like it so far so good
love that next thing I got was a more
messy I faced illuminator
I'm pretty sure you can get this in the
UK but I just kind of went skinny so I'm
just gonna come off the nose
I keep dropping everything on the bras
but it's really nice I write everything
two scoops one on the drawer so I've got
this shade which is called indiscretion
the reason why I got this shade is more
like a rose you go on tray like this
there's three different shade
should get really gold shade this shade
I think there's a lighter shade as well
but I don't really have any like rose
gold illuminators or my lighters so I
probably just have a lot of really
really like gold gold gold ones so I'm
really really excited to try this anyway
and look how pretty it is
I don't even want to use it like it just
looks gorgeous I think just looks like a
bit of silk just so nice but you guys
are hot getting with that I cannot wait
to use that too excited I haven't used
this one yet I've used everything else I
hope you haven't used a car you Bible
pilot yeah actually
then I've got skincare so that is all
the makeup that I got and I'm waiting to
get some face masks and I don't know if
you can get these in the you kind of
cause the glam boy Hollywood California
face mask to wear but I thought you
could just get in the merica I'm not
sure if you get these in the UK but
anyway so I've got to you I've got this
one and I've got this one so this one is
a gravity mod firm in treatment and I've
used both of these a slight rise in my
size I was too excited to wait so I just
use them but this thought is a firming
treatment I love it contact still money
basically apply it 15 20 minutes and
then you peel it off or you just peel it
off once it's dry but it is really
really firm firm tight like it's just
really really go inside so it says it's
firm lift i its own and sexy contours
definitely that is everybody guys it
really really tightens your skin like
those amazing I am a huge fan of and use
it once
I absolutely love this one I've got this
one as well which is the super most
clear and treatment so this is for
problem skin skin imperfections pore
refining mattifying and clarifying now
if you have sensitive skin I just would
not recommend using this it alone and
see but it's very strong then again it
might just be really strong just because
it's pretty good for like sensitive skin
and stuff so I don't really know too
much about skincare as you guys know I
just
whatever cuz I have three sensitive skin
so just kind of use like try a lot of
things and I'm not like I know I don't
know a lot about skin care anyway I'd
say this is very very strong I had this
on for about five six minutes and it was
stink in my face
it wasn't like a horrible singing pain
nose I kind of like a nice kind of sting
in it could really feel that it was back
in it's very very strong also if you
have really oily skin this is gonna be
amazing because I've got like oily skin
but not really really like slightly oily
and I used this off surprise I was like
five six minutes my skin when I took it
off was so mad there was like no oil on
the skin and I've never had that before
anything like her Sony product and I've
never ever ever ever had my skin matte
my skin has never been mad in its whole
entire life so it just actually got rid
of all the oil and my skin which was
crazy like obsessed so I would highly
highly highly recommend getting this if
you've got rid of all your skin all the
side problem skin skin imperfections
horrifying just anything on that I just
probably recommend this my face mask I
think I'm really really good I'm
actually obsessed so that is the basic
everything that I've got everything like
I said for location where to practice
more I got they'll be a link to the
website in the description box and like
I said all you do is create an account
and put in there what you want to get
and then go into it without fear also
they send over pictures it's really
really cool goes like they also send him
a photo so like when they've got like
one product that was send you a photo
for email to say just to check is this
what you want is this okay and stuff
before they send it to you which is
really good and they probably like just
keep you in thinking with like emails
and stuff in it didn't play that little
to calm until it took like two weeks
which is really really good considering
all these products are from different
websites and the nail just came in two
weeks went from there to there it's just
really really cool so I highly recommend
our website I'm just I'm gonna be over
there all the time and outside I am
really excited but I hope you guys
