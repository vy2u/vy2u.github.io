youtube channel if we're new here then
please subscribe
my name is Holly Boone it's nice to meet
you across the internet it's nice to
meet you through the screen hi um so
anyway today I thought I would do a
video about the new Anasazi of birthing
heroes prison palette I always use the
brush care I use the glow new sugar glow
kit I use use the lip color so yeah
basically just did a tutorial using
these products so if you want to find
out how i got this makeup look then
please keep watching and if you also
want to find out my thoughts on the
palette yeah don't forget to subscribe
give it a thumbs up you know the drill
I'm gonna shut the up let's go in
the tutorial okay so this is the
Anastasia Beverly Hills Prison palette
it's wait out the modern renaissance one
and it's also straight out the
subculture one after all the drama on
this subculture one I was on the move it
didn't like it bye I'm really excited to
try this one because I've always loved
their palettes I just feel like this
subculture wants me just one that just
didn't work out so these are all the
shades that you get and so you get just
many shades as you do in all the other
palettes I'm obsessed with that bright
yellow shed and then you get this brush
to one side you have a fluffy end it's
just the same brush as you get in with
the palettes and I love this brush
especially this end oh you should save
quite a lot I'm just gonna play around
just see what happens so I'm going to
first of all take this shape Eden okay
so yeah I'm first we're going to take
this shape Eden and I'm gonna apply this
lightly in one crease and just above the
crease there is a shade in this palette
called dimension which looks unreal and
there's also a show called lucid which I
kind of really want to use okay so it's
super pigmented it's bended out nicely
it's not sticking to any areas I found
with the subculture palette that it
would like stick here and then it were
just kind of right no you couldn't apply
products anywhere else it would just
want disperse the pollak nicely but this
is bomb there is a tiny bit of fallout
in the palette but that's what you're
going to get when you get people into
shadows as long as it's not excessive
and it's not like chalky then it's fine
I thought like feel like I want to use
this Scheidler this power pearly shade
it's like a more be sharing my review
more of you whatever you want to call it
I think I want to use this shirt okay so
I'm gonna apply this using my Sigma 86
brush cut in the crease I feel like I'm
getting ill and I never get out so funny
because when he used to work at my old
job and I Loki like waiting to get it
like whoever they are I never got ill
and now it's like I love what I do like
my career my job is everything like I
love it
I get here and I'm like what the
okay so I'm just going back with this
brush which has actually an Eden on it
and I'm gonna just make sure that the
shade blended in so I'm just gonna go
lightly over that edge okay so now I
feel like I just wanna like deep enough
and darken up the outer corner of my
eyes so I'm really after this shade
which is parallel and I'm using the
short end of this brush that comes with
the palette I'm gonna bring this up into
the crease to about halfway and then I'm
gonna pack it on the outer corner of the
eye
go back to that purple shade and just go
over that edge
okay so what I'm gonna do now is I'm
going to cut half um increase I do this
a lot I know but I like the way this
looks on my eyes so you're gonna cut off
my case of some concealer and then I'm
gonna use one of the oily shadows I
think I want to use this one it's called
dimension it looks Gorge
I'm gonna read that lighten up don't
worry don't worry I'm not gonna do it
like that I like the way that brown when
I applied this purple shade on top it
goes more like a dark purple I was a
knight brown if some reason if you guys
can see like that little bit there you
just want the practice won't stick it's
that Papa really it was going so well I
can tell why is it doing that can you
say can you guys see okay there's like a
little patch that way just put on just
won't stick to my eyelid I'm getting
really hungry that's really pissed me
off I'm gonna have to add a winged liner
and hopefully I'll cover like most of it
okay sorry I'm gonna use that shade
dimension which is this oil shade right
here which looks unreal
I'm gonna track my finger click the
brush it's not really oh yeah it was the
finger it's way bell it's a bit like
blue with like a purple reflect which is
nice okay I am gonna wing my line up
because I'm just not happy with just
tiny bit here with seem she just looked
like and then when I try and blend it it
just kind of disappears so I'm just
gonna wing my line I'm hoping that I'll
cover that up
I'm gonna use my wire cell couture line
it-it's a black liner and it's so mad
it's a joke I live for it and it's so
black so Corey thought well do this
because I am Bri what I do wanna
folks do you like though
okay that's definitely made it look so
much nicer
I didn't the wing it's kind of covered
up that little bit there so I'm gonna
make a start on my face now if actually
I'm going to do is I'm going to use of
my pixie Rose oil blend where price of
this this skin is a super hydrate and
I'll let you live for it I'm just gonna
try this good
if you guys don't follow me on snapchat
and when I mentioned this just snap
charge and I did recently get old
therapy treatment on my lower part of my
face and then I recently had it on the
top and it just tightens the skin and it
kind of just gives you back the collagen
that you had in your skin when you like
16 17 he's kind of recommending when
you're like late to when he's 30 but you
can have it when you're younger and it
kind of is better kind of prevents a lot
of stuff as well so I had it done and
honestly my skin just feels super tight
really nice um I do like things a lot
tighter this bit first Hightower just
biscuits so yeah recently had that done
I'm just really impressed the result so
far I mean you have to wait three months
to see this like the full result and
that's all it takes
but so far so good
I'm just applying some of the
Porefessional by benefit I just realized
I haven't stuck my lashes on what is
going on I need to stick my lashes on so
I'm just gonna use some of the
Maybelline the Big Shot mascara
we use the House of lashes eyelash glue
I really like that's good okay yeah so
whilst I wait for my lashes to dry just
underskirts now I'm going to just apply
my foundation so I'm gonna use the Mac
Studio Fix fluid mixed with the
Maybelline fit me matte for us so I'm
gonna adopt the Mac Studio Fix fluid
around my face first also the max you
know off okay so I'm just in the
middle of film in and the
electorate decided to just go I'm like
what the all the lights just went
off why was i okay so then I'm gonna fry
some of their maybe fit me matte
poreless in between and the Studio Fix
really oxidizes on me like it goes
really Orange but then once I apply like
if it's an ounce it looks fine so I'm
just pressing it and using my 3d render
from Sigma I prefer this sponge to a
beauty render because it doesn't absorb
as much product I don't prefer the shape
of it
I like the pointing bit so you can get
right under your eye and stuff right
around the eyebrow I feel really the
electric just went off like I was like
please come back don't piss me off Barry
why me out go try to flip me the other
hand
it's really hard I was also saying on
snapchat if you don't have me on
snapchat is I get Botox in my master to
muscle here because I grind my teeth so
bad like literally when I had my old
teeth I grinded my teeth so so bad
that's why there was so short on one
side that's why you're not getting
veneers because there was nowhere it
wasn't even that my teeth were straight
out for my people fine straight wise but
I'd grinded them so bad on one side one
side my mouth was sure teeth were
shorter than the other so whenever my
veneers I was like I could not risk
grinding my teeth because I paid a lot
for these teeth I ain't about to chip
ones you don't I mean and they do give
you like a mouth guard thing that you
wear when you sleep but that just to me
I just doesn't stay in my mouth will not
wake up in Hoonah nights in my bed
somewhere
so anyway
I recently got not recently I had it
done when I got my veneers done I've got
my I got Botox done in these two muscles
and it stopped me from grinding my teeth
but the only thing it has done is it
does soften your jaw line I mean I've
always had quite a sharp jaw line always
and it did soften my jaw line quite a
lot so I ended up getting the your
therapy just to tighten it up just to
make it a bit sharper again but yeah
actually it's a fun little saved me I
swear it's like just helped me out so
much I had to get it topped up every
sort of six to eight weeks I would say
but it literally completely stopped me
going my teeth and I'll it to the point
they said grime received that bad I
would wake up and my jaw would ache so
bad I couldn't even like talk or any
from Freddy's half an hour it would be
like akin so bad honestly saved me I
never grind my teeth anymore so I'm just
sticking these luscious on and these are
the coconut it's in the style of war
when do I ever wet I need to start
wearing more lashes I did tweet the
other day maybe yesterday I think I
tweeted like what's your favorite lashes
because I do need to find some other
ones because I just literally live in
these once the glue still dry and so
we'll just let the gray tie down while
I've do my concealer but I just thought
I'd tell you that guys up because lady
said like all your drool looks soft and
like you look like you lost weight by it
was just because I had that done it
softened my jaw line I'm not mad at it
but um yeah that's just what happens
when you get that I'm just glad I wore
my teeth anymore cuz I obviously pay for
my veneers I don't want to ruin them do
you know what I mean okay so Eddy right
let's go on to makeup and shut the back
up so for my under-eye I'm gonna use it
it cosmetics bye bye under-eye I look
she got this in Manchester the other day
and they had it cosmetic stand which I
didn't even know the UK had it cause my
ex turns what they do so just I'm just I
think it's quite new it wasn't the last
time I was there anyway and yeah it's
good the fiber under-eye I've got the
same medium town I love this I've used
it four times now the first time I
wasn't too sure about it
okay the first thing I am ready before
that is I'm going to use my benefit
brightening corrector I'm gonna put the
tiniest bit under here just to cancel
out the dark circles because otherwise
with concealer I feel like sometimes it
can still show through so next I'm going
to use that fiber under-eye and I'm just
gonna apply it using my Mac
one-nine-five you don't need too much
I'm gonna bring it up down the sides of
the nose my forehead a reason that NARS
radiant creamy concealer in the shake
Jinja cuz I just don't want it to be as
bright as my under-eye I'm gonna put a
little bit on my chin as well he's been
watching X Factor by the way I am
obsessed with that girl what's her name
great it grace
gracious piece of piano right so music
obsessed well I'll understand watch the
next factor honestly she could smash her
life if she went independent I swear I
feel like X factors like P put on there
on there and there so I'll be tight
they're so young they have so many years
to try make it independent do you see
I'm saying I feel like X Factor should
be for like older people when they've
kind of tried to go down that route and
have a min successful then I think xpect
has come with a last resort a good
option for that but it's like I had a
friend that we don't expect two to three
years ago and like she told me how fixed
it was like she told me how bad it is
and that when you get to live she was
she was in the live shows and I think
she got to about week it was quite close
to the final it's quite close today she
was telling about how fixed it is like
how they already know who's gonna win
some people get more training some
people get better song choices it's a
lot like it rose on that you don't even
realize and it's obviously because it's
a TV show it's for its for our
entertainment we don't want to watch it
when everyone's good all the time right
you want to see people it out we
want to see like that that's just
how it is and also when you leave
x-factor you have to sign a contract
with them when you go on the show and
you can't produce any music for like a
year because like a year maybe longer
now even longer than that actually run a
year after
but you can't then you can't because
you're still signed of x-factor you
can't vote for your own music and stuff
even if you didn't win it's like it's
just a up situation and also like
labels get really funny about it and
they won't touch people that put on X
Factor
even the people that win I feel like
they never really I don't really hear
about them now do you guys like I feel
oh you don't really hear about them
anymore
I do you think bands do well for me
expectantly like I do you think I'll see
Little Mix and One Direction I thought
he'd say do you some of these eyes
almost like you're so incredible you're
so amazing you write your own music you
play piano you sing
you're insane cool I just think well you
do it no go up there I'm just using the
RCM a translucent powder by the way and
I'm using a different sponge this powder
is bomb I'm obsessed I'm gonna apply
some of the NYX cream the NYX mineral
stick foundation in the st. Roch
probably they just continued this I was
a bit shook we went into Selfridges NYX
and we were like where's the mineral
sticks and they were like older
discontinued oh it's like they tell me
that because I actually loved that stick
so I'm using my fenty Beauty the
foundation brush and I always use this
for my contour I really like it and I
just kind of use it to blend out the
edges and then I'll go over it with the
sponge
now this is Tony's mobile could get
ready with me rather than a roofie I
just talk too much I talk a lot but I
can get ready with my mates for a night
out generally when I sit I do my makeup
for B I just feel like I'm talking to my
mates
see I've got the shade medium tan in
that can see it up I do you think it's
too light I just thought it would be
fine medium talents will that be quite
okay
surprises conceited on the bridge of my
nose is the NARS radiant creamy lip
didn't jong-min up dry for a little bit
so to set the rest of my face I've been
using this face power dust
Studio Fix from Mac and this is the
powder and I've been using this on top
of the foundation and it just gives me a
flawless finish and I used to do this a
long time ago I used to use the medium
plus powder from Mac I think it's called
and let's try this because it's the same
sort of shade as my foundation a bit
lighter and it just works pretty well so
I like its massive fluffy brush from it
cause my ex this is the number three so
heavenly luxe jumbo powder brush and it
is literally I just ditched you apply
powder like this and it's insane this
brush is insane so I just dip my brush
in here I don't want to pick up too much
of this product because it is very
pigmented so I don't really too much and
then I'll just literally stipple this
all over the face and it makes the world
of difference I feel like my makeup just
won't move all Dino put it this press
the powder when you don't have Rob use
when I let you press it in just set all
these creams CA you can use a
translucent powder but sometimes I felt
like the translucent powder I can end up
looking a bit too ashy so I'm just gonna
bring it up a tiny bit so that went
under isn't so bright
this studio fix powder is really really
nice and especially if you get this you
fix fluid foundation from Mac the to
work amazing together
and also this big brush is just perfect
and it's so soft this is my new favorite
brush I love it so much I do a contour
when you use the pur cosmetics this is
the contour diary Diaries I'm gonna use
the dark shade in here and I'm gonna
bring this in too far
just gonna leave this kind of like just
under that sheet when that the power
keeps going off in my house don't know
what's going on but it's gone off twice
now while stopping trying to film when
I'm assured your life just went off and
I was like don't piss me off right I'm
just gonna bake under there like that I
want a really sharp contour today I'm
just painting it nice we're gonna just
bend that in press that in lightly I'm
gonna quickly finish off my under-eye so
manifest we'll go with the shape Eden on
the fluffy brush which was that coral
shade the flash shades I used underneath
and then I'm gonna go for the purple
shade which is the shade ler
I think for the inner corner I want to
go for this shade right here which could
loose it it's got our reflexive green
and gold in it
it's really nice with my knees at my
inner corner so I'm just surprised this
shade use in my zoeva two to six just
pressing it on the inner corner I don't
know what student the bottom I'm gonna
apply some mascara for the time being
and this is the Mac extender play so I
have these two brush kits from Anasazi
which was sent to me in PR and I'm so so
grateful so we've got this pink run
which is called radiant and this one
which is called gradient so I'm going to
show you the shades inside so this is
the gradient palette and these are the
shades so this shade right here is
called Vegas this one is called dusk
this one is called chocolate and this
one is called blackberry and then you
have this palette which is the radiant
one and you have this shade here which
is called spoiled this one is called
coastline this one is called breeze and
this one is called Terrace so I don't
want to try out this blush kit and I
want to kind of use the tiny bit of this
shade and this shade should apply the
tiniest bit of these two shades I think
that looks nice
see a reason the show BlackBerry and the
shade Vega is mixed in a bun I think
that looks nice I like that and then
next we have this glow kit from
Anastasia Beverly Hills this is the
sugar palette and these are the shades
so this one is trade marshmallow this
one is gumdrop this one is what a scotch
and this one is starburst wet my brush
I'm using the morphe M 5-10 brush and I
think I want to do a mixture of this
shade I think I actually use this red
butterscotch yeah I'm going to use the
shea butter Scotch from this palette so
that's this one right here anyway this
looks like I really like these glorious
one Anastasio
they've never failed me ever nice you
look at that um it's nice it's like a
little bit more glittery than the was
what's the gold one called does one this
gold it's like this palette one of the
glow kits it's a little bit more
glittery than that one but I don't mind
a little bit of glue so got these three
liquid lipstick shades - awesome every
house I'm gonna swatch let me show you
the colors for this first one is in the
shade starfish which looks like this
this one is in the shade rock sand and
then this one is to show trouble and
then they also sent these three mini
liquid lipsticks and to show you dazed
bittersweet and Hudson so this one is to
show bittersweet I'm obsessed with this
shade and then next we have this shade
which is the shade Hudson and then last
thing about this one which is the shade
days I think this one's my favorite out
of everything so I don't know what how I
actually when he is I'm just looking my
arm for reference I'm like um what shade
should I use I've done a lot on my eyes
so I don't really want like a bright lip
so me I might just go for like this one
so I'm gonna use my lip liner this is
boldly bare by Mac it's gonna line my
lips and then I'm gonna use the liquid
lipstick in the shade starfish which was
the first one i swatched
so lastly I'm going to spray my face
with the Airman's okay all nighter
setting spray so that is the finished
look I hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial please give it a thumbs up
please subscribe I love you forever and
so overall thoughts on everything the
eyeshadow palette I feel like I'm not
sure yet I haven't use enough of the
shades to determine whether I love it or
not I love all the shades that I use the
path enough found it really difficult to
set for our shade for some reason it was
going darker in certain places and then
like when I would apply it here if you
guys saw it wouldn't
I just wouldn't applying if someone
would try and blend it it would just
disappear I don't know if it's just that
shade but all the rest of the shades
that I used I absolutely love so I'm
gonna use this palette a lot more you'll
see me to see more tutorials because I
want to use more of the shades so I feel
like I need to use it a couple more
times to give my overall opinion on that
but I do love the glow kit I think it's
really really nice this highlight is a
bit more literary than the other bloke
it the one that I always use I think
it's the gold one it's the gold one that
I always use anyway that was a little
bit more for glittery highlight but I'm
not mad yet I do love it I really like
it exercise on the skin and I love the
blush palettes and I love the liquid
lipstick shades so yeah I just need to
use the pile a bit more and then I'll
let you guys know but yeah I hope you
guys enjoyed this video please give it a
thumbs up please subscribe and I will
see you in my next tutorial or video or
whatever the are you hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
