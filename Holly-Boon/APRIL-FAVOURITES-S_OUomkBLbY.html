filling my April favorites everything
that I've been loving in April and
Mercer is gonna be makeup but there are
a couple of other things I want to talk
about I've been loving as well and so
before I starts with what the makeup of
want to just share with you guys this
watch that I was sent from pulpit v the
comes in a box like this and I've been
loving it I really really really want
his new watch icon when he's like for
summer and this one is just uh I'm
obsessed so leave your on the place then
you get like a little piece of paper I
don't know what this is actually I'm
gonna have a look um okay so it was like
a cute little man yo and it's got like
okay okay so just tells you about the
warranty a bit about the company the
range is that they have different straps
wow that's really cool because this is
it is water-resistant okay they have an
Instagram which is v watches that's cool
I'm willing this below for you guys so
yeah and then it comes into a box like
this so this is the watch like I said
and I'm oh my god I'm so upset he's so
nice I loved how I come to this like
really nice box and I love the color of
the strap because it's just perfect for
summer the watches that I have like oh
we haven't always get like black straps
and but this one is so gorgeous and it's
just amazing and I'm just up but yeah
I'm so good if it's not so you guys can
see and so I'm willing them below for
you guys because I didn't really had any
it scram and stuff so I will put up a
lot and they always have a website and
what it is is they have very exclusive
pieces so they only have a concerted
amount of each piece and the reason why
it's called v is because you can only
order them on the 5th of the month which
is like a really cool idea so if you
want to get one you have to wait till
the fifth of the month to be able to
order one and they do sell out quite
quick I've heard so yeah so this is the
war amazi obsess perfect for summer
gorgeous have so many different ones on
the website like literally loads and I
think the first thing I've been loving
this month and second of all I love this
table okay I'm gonna show you it's got a
lipstick around on it it's just such a
bit of me right so I don't know if you
guys have heard of Ashley Wagner you
probably have she's got in
- Graham youtuber she's got silver hair
she's gorgeous she owns this range and
she also said she sent me this top and
another top but she was to send me this
really cute phone case it's got
lipsticks on it some obsessed so you
need to check her out she's such a
lovely girl I'll link her website below
as well and also her YouTube and her
Instagram if you don't know who she is
but yeah so now I'm gonna talk about
makeup so those are the things I've been
loving also actually quickly she sent me
this mug of lipsticks on him how could
I've been putting I'm gonna put my
makeup brushes and I think it's cute um
see ya now I'm gonna be one to makeup so
the first thing I want to talk about is
the map it gives me some bronzer I've
recently
everyone was hiking about this bronzer
and I was just like you know what I was
going to buy it because everyone who's
gonna buy it
and I've been obsessed with it since
it's really pigmented bronzer you don't
need it a lot because if you I've gone a
bit extreme about a couple of times and
I've looked really Orange and because it
is a very warm bronzer but it's just so
nice I don't think you love it and I
really find it hard to find roses that I
like so I'm a really impressive there's
I don't think I'm actually gonna bother
trying anything out now because I love
this one
so yes I post thing that I've been
loving makeup wise and then second thing
I've got the gold deposit mineralized
skinfinish by Mac as well and I've also
been loving this this is a perfect
highlight so if you have darker skin
tone and also I like to use this as a
highlight sort of on my forehead in
certain areas because sometimes I don't
like to have a super highlight but I
want to look a little bit gory so this
is actually perfect for that so I have
been living for this as well I believe
to apply like a normal highlights I've
been playing like mary-lou manizer or
champagne pot here and then Luke she
just applying this slightly underneath
just to help it blend out a little bit
and also just give a little bit extra
shoosh you know I like a little bit
extra guy and yeah I've been loving that
as well
I'm talking really really fast I'm not
going to slow down a little bit and the
next thing I want to talk about is the
Taylor blue contour kit I've been up in
this I've used Lowe's
it's before and this one is just great I
love it it's often nothing bad I can say
about this console kit
I love the shades I love the highlight
shade this shade I love that for setting
under my eyes it's kind of like a banana
powder it's really really nice the
consistency of the product is really
nice as well I love been using these two
shades to contour and I just don't have
anything bad to say about it I'm really
really impressed a bit I know she sells
them for like 23 pounds which is a lot
cheap and compared to other contour kits
because in my opinion this is basically
on the same level as the Anastasia
Beverly Hills one and I know the
Anastasia Beverly Hills one is about 47
pounds so you can get this one for like
20 pound if you prefer alright Instagram
she's got her Instagram hot medicine for
an Instagram and the mob website and
stuff so I'll also link with that below
as well I like everything but I okay so
you guys want to get anything but I have
been loving that so if you're looking
for a inexpensive contour kit that'll be
really good then 100% I recommend this
one looking into breeze next thing I
want to talk about is the matte liquid
last liner so when I went to the shop
when I went to the shop when I went to
mark I did we know what I want to get I
just want you to try a new few things
and a few new things I really to learn
to speak and I was I've run out of
liquid liner at this point on he said so
I need a liquid eyeliner or a gel she
said the Jo had run out but she said
that
Adele's makeup Irish uses this on her
because if your eyes run or if you've
got oily eyelids apparently this is
amazing because it doesn't wear off but
it's really hard to get off and it's so
true like I've worn it so many times
over the top of my stay I'll do it with
a gel and then I'll apply it on top and
you just literally when I try to take my
makeup off I can I'll let you scrub in
to get it off it just does not come off
so when I go on that night and stuff
this is like perfect because sometimes I
do get up watery eyes or whatever or you
makeup wears off whatever so this is
amazing
the only thing is it's not going to make
give you a map eyeliner it's a bit like
shiny but I still love it so I have been
living for this there's another thing
that I love
next thing is the Lancome perfecting
primer this is oil-free this I used to
use this age it's gone up when I first
started youtube I used to use it as a
primer consistency consistently all the
time and I just kind of like stopped
using it and I don't even know why I
just feel like I went on a thing I've
got trying to find another one to use or
trying to find a better one so I did
used to use the Nivea Furman post shave
balm I still absolutely love that rings
purchase it again I just haven't really
got around to going anywhere to get it
why do you need to get that again but I
have been loving this I ordered this
about two weeks ago I've been using it
every day since and I just really love
it I feel like it minimizes my pores it
gives a really nice smooth finish to the
skin and yeah I just love it so if
you've got really scared don't worry
this is oil free
it feels oily when you put on the skin
but it's not and the consistency of the
product is quite different it just kind
of like smoothes out minimizes pores and
yeah I love it it's quite pricey but
well yeah yeah but the last thing I want
to talk about is this Sigma eyeshadow
palette so this is the Sigma brilliant
and spellbinding palette and I have been
IV just on my eyes today whoops I filmed
this look it would even be up before
this video after this video home decided
um but I have been loved it I loved it
I just absolutely love it I love these
colors I feel like literally this yellow
shade I love this pink trailer this
orange shade on the Browns I think she
loved it
so yeah that's another thing that I've
been loving and that's actually
everything I want to talk about
we've sick mind you actually have a
discount code now because I'm working
with them so I'll put that in the
description box so they can't remember
off the top of my head have so many
crazy I just cannot even remember and
but pretty down below in case you want
to practice any from Sigma you can get I
think it's 10% off the ego which does
make a difference because I know that
the brushes are so far quite pricey but
yeah that is actually everything that
I've been up in this month I hope you
guys enjoyed this video make sure you
give it a thumbs up if you did and make
sure to subscribe if you haven't already

see next and always see you again next
