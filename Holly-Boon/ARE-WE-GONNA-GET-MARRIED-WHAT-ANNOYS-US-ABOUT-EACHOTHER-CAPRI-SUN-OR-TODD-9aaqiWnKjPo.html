understand how a lot I admit I don't
think many people do he didn't realize
that you could have it as I not an
income I understood you had a talent um
but I didn't know
I don't know much about YouTube and to
be fair I've never you know I've never
started to stop doing something it's
your career you do what you do what you
want to do what's the last text message

other ones favorite food bring doughnuts

can't we've got plenty of other things
to be concentrating on yeah okay I have
a nightmare I won't lie I'm not the tide
yes in answer to that there's no be able
time it will happen yeah when it happens
and it's probably a man near future so
how did you guys meet
I'd be fun we we had a good our group my
group mates and Holly's group of mates
flew out to I be from the same day and
flew back at the same time so fate
really I wasn't even gonna go lie and he
wasn't a guy I need a guy I'll just come
back I'll come back couple weeks before
and it was only with a different group
of mates I'm a turnarounds me and said I
were gonna go back out again for three
or four days I've seen you on social
media but we haven't there was no
communication and no but when I met you
I didn't know I didn't know is you sort
of thing so we just we just thought I've
you already told everyone always thinks
up yeah before we this yeah it was all
always be like a place yeah close to us
alone occurs
it was we had a good couple of days
together didn't wait to get to know each
other and stuff so he looked after me
what's your five-year plan if you have
one we already know you feel like tide
has changed what you for you wondered
should you said that I've already
changed your outlook on things yeah
excited to hate people when I was very
cold
well I know very cold but no more loving
oh yeah
it's it's nice folk but it is what it is
isn't it people bring you like to think
people bring the best out of you
don't you say you bring the best out of
me and hopefully I do that for you so
five year plan we haven't really we've
got my ideas of stuff we would like to
do I want to just we want to travel the
world we face we travel in the world
yeah exactly but in the mean during that
period as well we do want to have some
stability with regards to having our own
home together and also putting a ring on
it does taught appreciate how talented
you are at makeup and stuff even though
you probably think she's taking brooms
get ready help you oh that's cute
no is it yeah of course the do you I
appreciate it it's like a form of art
isn't it
got a tattoo in May you cook all that
kind of stuff where you can visualize
something can put it into house whatever
let you use makeup you've only picked
this question you've only picked this
question because you asked me probably
other three weeks or so I'm like nice
how does thought feel about how often
you change your nail color long this
situation is along it is long wait I
have to do with my tutorial what was a
long because I always have to match my
makeup looks
it's an ICD thing that honestly it's
long for everyone the whole conversation
you don't know me I spent so many hours
in the nail shop and spend so much money
on the nail shop a fan question a
discount I got off
what's your favorite memory together
favorite memory we've got a lot we've
got a lot of holiday what I mean odd is
for for last year yes year sorry
let me finish - I wanna talk about loads
of nice memories together alone in time
public way no because we just got loads
loads of noise and then we surprise your
best friend and his girlfriend
that means missus has been after Tommy
and yes
they'd been booked I'd be for a long
time and due to work commitments and
stuff we couldn't really get the time
off for do - have you ever holidays at
we have booked and was able to squeeze a
couple of days probably three weeks
before they were due to fly out and then
so we just booked it straightaway
montastraea way throughout day before I
knew exactly where he was sunbathing and
it was a longest or 24 hours waiting for
him to come out because we can do
anything on social maybe like in the
pool those higher than the pool so we're
not in the pool and then we just see
like what kind of film would we be in if
we can be in a film
we'd been if not now golden would be in
a thriller and our Savior yeah it's our
second er that's it for me what's one
thing you do that annoys Todd a monk
thing Todd does that annoys you aren't
you yes I want sir well I think annoys
you okay I think annoys you when you're
not put a finger in your mouth also
older said that it annoys me about you
can sleep longer in the mornings and I
are your eyes eye huh when it gets the
weekend I know I've done working to do
offense done I'll have two days just
chilling and his house I'm out I'm
sleeping ain't nobody gonna wake me up
all right okay so you've got some water
what thing do you get annoyed at get
annoyed that there's a couple of things
probably a couple of things in not in
any order
probably I'm OCD so I'm constantly on
your case about that not being tough
things are not tigh leading please no
there's not tidy
noeul yeah I like that
someone's gotta be organized okay we
can't have two of us messy can you
imagine so one thing I think annoys you
about money you know related been and
I'll be eating something I've got it
warm that annoys me again with OCD
we'll go and grab a takeaway from
somewhere and you know when you're OCD
shout out to OCD people out there that
are like thinking the same mindset as me
you put in the car and you leave it to
when you get home even then when you get
home just section it all out you take
away your plates how will you cutlery
and and then you portion it out right
all all lovely all settle down that's a
lie and all that and I'm there for I can
close the door of a car to drive us back
the takeaway there's a chip hanging out
the mouth because I'm like sitting there
I can smell it and I'm hungry did you
ever do this price is what it burns my
time
but mom we think is the Burger King on
LBI dry fruit get the future she brought
holy hog day I'll be in the back I'd eat
the chips on the way home so they like
my bra would be sat in the front they
won't know I'm being at the chips and
they'd be like one that's got my heart
any chips and I don't care it's a robber
and get a pressure on fancy pants
question rose who's more sy than either
one and Baptist sums up
Louise me though no there's a difference
as like that I laugh in it when we get
in the car you know when I like a
McDonald's and I've got 20 burgers or
something and I was laying in the
channel here for rustling coming out
like coming from the left side I know
what's happening it's not enough about
it now it's just one of those things
another thing that annoys him is I eat
some sweets before I'm gonna make savory
right here up but another thing order
takeaway
Sunday evening for example got takeaway
come in and you've got you know first of
all got sweets on a Sunday always got
sweets we have like a pig out day on
Sunday but I just order to take away the
man from dominos has 45 you're like okay
night 45 20 minutes after we just
ordered Polly's got got a chocolate bar
and a mouthful why do you easy sweet
stuff before you eat savory oh my
why are you right what's your favorite
thing to do when use I have no children
like they film etc food filming would
you see free apps Hey
okay there you go special guest in the
building how often do you argue any day
never is a little things yeah yeah like
me eating sweets before my favorite
foods come then yeah but we just don't
argue
I do get quite snappy sometimes when
it's that time of the month goes you
know
so I'll just go to hard to get out well
do you just go she don't say things you
know she just say one thing though just
if you had time we're gonna do something
spontaneous together what would you do
choose the most random walkest thing
right my thing because we're very
different in the sense
my thing would be go to the airport and
just go somewhere to fly somewhere
anywhere run them just quickly get see a
picture go to the airport and then I
find out difficult because I'm a planner
and he's an organizer and you have
anything oh yeah so I'm just like for me
moment be something to do with
adrenaline like bungee jump jump out of
the plane do something spontaneous like
that is the first say sorry we're both
very stubborn me more so now I'm deny I
think I'm more stubborn than you yeah
like you're the more grown-up why'd you
come on you're like oh yeah no one's go
quiet and I'll leave the room I'm trying
to watch a mink or I'm on laptop or
watching TV or football
and I'll go I'll compose that oh okay so
that's some of the questions
look at that answer that was loads but
we're hungry so we're gonna go get food
you know don't say starving because you
shouldn't use that word you trying the
meaning of the word you're not I mean
mommy she said to me okay don't sing of
