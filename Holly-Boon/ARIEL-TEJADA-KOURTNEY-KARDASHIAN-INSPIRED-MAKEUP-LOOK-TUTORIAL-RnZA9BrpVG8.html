he does very soft glam beautiful makeup
lips and I just I'm obsessed with his
Instagram so I was going for his
Instagram the other night and I always
do that and I just come across this

Anastasia Beverly Hills brow Wiz I'm
gonna go for more of a natural brow
today not so dramatic so I'm just going
to take the clear brow gel this is by
under stars in Beverly Hills as well
we're going to comb through my eyebrows
quickly
oh yeah movin up to a browser I'm just
going to literally do you like I'm just
going to apply a little bit of product
and just brush it out basically
I'm so jealous of people that have like
really bushy thick brows like minor
quiet might have got better over the
years I've just tried to leave them and
even growing stuff because um when I was
at school it was like crushing recovery
thin eyebrows Evan pop better I believe
in and then fucked it up for later life
so I try to don't mind growing mine been
ok but I just really want those like
really thick bushy dark brows so today
I'm gonna start with my face because I'm
not gonna do too much on my eyes so I
want you to start on my face today and
first of all I'm just going to apply
some moisturizer and I'm going to take
the LMS biotechs skin energizing day
cream so now I'm going to spray my face
with the mac fix+
for my foundation I'm going to take the
backup ultimate coverage cream I'm also
going to mix some of the color
fix/enhance drops my bottle it's
absolutely love you so much I'm going to
mix it in
mix this in with my foundation because
this foundation is really Matt and I do
want it to be a little bit more dewy so
I think this is shade candlelight that's
what it says they're really really dark
actually I don't want to put too many
drops in it apply my foundation I'm
going to take the Sigma flat kabuki
brush which is the f80 brush
so fuckin cielo obviously I'm going to
take the Maybelline fit me concealer
Holy Grail gone back to it
obsessed love it nothing want to say
really
okay so spend that in I'm going to take
my Sigma concealer blend kabuki brush
also just quickly wait to mention so I
am doing a meet-and-greet at the clove
show this year on the 3rd of December
I'm going to be at the dress by Lauren
stand and I don't know if you guys know
you just what I run is but she created
some of the pieces form wine collections
with my bandage dress so I'm really
close to them that really lovely so I'm
going to be doing a meet and greet up
there stand from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.
I won't link all the details below as
you guys want to come back it's not
anything like Syria so it's not anything
crazy big or anything I just look she
want to meet some of you guys and talk
to my car very much so if you down for
that then come see me
I said I'm going to bake that everyone
under I reason that my co translucent
setting powder but I can heed to try new
setting powder because that already this
one I love it but if you guys know of
any other ones let me know
I've heard them on the Patrick's I use
is really good I just don't know where
you get it from where can I get that
Annie okay
hi the Russian reason is the Sigma
tapered highlight brush which is the
f-35 brush okay so I blow smoke out ah
we're arriving flight and/or I'm being
blind it's right in front of me just to
talk bitch I am I don't look properly
anyway I was going to I'm just going to
set the rest of my face using the Mac
this is the Mac medium plus Studio Fix
perfecting powder medium plus is the
shade that I'm using and I love this to
set the rest of my face it's really
really good to have anything bad to say
about it when using it all the time I'm
going to use my expert face brush by
Real Techniques
I'm just gonna leave my undereyes baked
for a bit longer and I'm going to go
over my eyebrows
okay so don't even what I'd write a bake
bake bake bake a-bake flip number and
I'm going to just go and start on my
eyes and I'm going to do too much on my
eyes so okay so first I'm just going to
apply some to fit me can see it as my
eyes something wasn't my Sigma bake
precision brush and then I'm just going
to take the same brush I'm just going to
apply some with Laura Mercier
Laura Mercier translucent powder and
just set my lids just muchos Mary thin
so in regards to Kourtney Kardashian's
pitchy I can't really see what she has
on her lids because she's got her eyes
open in the photo but it just looks like
a really nice brown something Brown
anyway they always use Browns and soft
and so it's like a really soft brown eye
so I'm just going to interpret what I
would do my eyes um like a soft glam
look so that's what I'm going to do so
first of all I'm going to take my Mac
217 brush and the Mac give me Sun
bronzer and would apply some of this
inner crease
I'm just going to take a clean fluffy
brush and this is the Mac two to four
and I'm just going to go over that to
make sure it's blended all nicely just
to feed it a little bit okay so for my
lid color I'm actually going to take the
paint pot by Mac and this is in a
rubenesque it's just this really
gorgeous black gold shade it's really
pretty it reflects a little bit pink as
well it's really nice I'm going to take
some of this on my Mac 242 and just
apply this all over the lid
you
okay so I'm just going to dust this is
powered and leave my eyes
so I'm just going to apply some
highlight to my eyelids I'm just going
to use the mac 242 brush again
spray some fix+ I'm going to take this
shade moonstone from the like it by
under stars above the hills and just
apply light into the center of my lid
I'm actually gonna just mix in some of
this straight here which is summer which
is more gold because I'm just going to
price the mascara I'm using the Loreal
telescopic so for lashes I'm going to
take the ideal natural demi whispies and
for eyelash glue I'm gonna take the
Demeter lashes glue I'll obviously it's
like my favorite eyelash glue of all
time your eyelashes just will never ever
ever move of this on like I love it so
much
okay so while I wait for those eyelash
glue to dry a little bit I'm going to
finish off my face so I'm just going to
take the Mac give me Sun bronzer and
this duo fiber brush by Lottie London I
really like it pretty good
next the full cons are going to take
this shade right here which is by makeup
geek and this is shade half-hearted this
is just like a mini duo fiber brush by
Mac I quarry the number cuz it's rubbed
off but it's just like a reasonable one
so Kourtney Kardashian has got blush on
in this picture so I'm going to mix
these two shades together from makeup
geek and one is called infatuation and
one is called main squeeze
so infatuation and main squeeze I'm
going to mix the two together
so I'm just going to finish with my eyes
so Kourtney's got a little bit of brown
under her eye lash line and then she's
got white in the waterline and a really
highlighted in a corner and her top
lashes are quite to my X I'm going to
apply some mascara to the top as well
so first of all I'm going to apply some
mascara to the top lashes so Courtney
like I said has got white and her
waterline already highlighted in a
corner so I'm actually gonna take the
pure white crow behind by Mac and apply
some this in the waterline this is my
favorite white liner that always stays
in my waterline as long as I set it and
it always stays it doesn't move so rush
you can know just applies with the
winged liner brush by zoeva okay so I'm
going to step that with the this is a
Mac pigment in pure white I'm just going
to set that just to make sure that the
white stays white okay so now I'm going
to take my fierce face ether tea pencil
brush and the Mac could give me some
bronzer I'm gonna run some of this under
my lash line
the bottom lashes a minute L'Oreal
telescopic Courtney's bottom lashes are
really really long and nice and just so
full and after that this mascara is the
best for making your eyelashes look at
that
so especially your bottom lashes so if
you're looking for a really good mascara
telescope it is the one you need okay so
now I'm going to highlight so I'm going
to spray my face with the mac fix+
Cory doesn't know she's got much
highlight on her cheekbones in this
picture I can't read it because it's a
face on photo but I am gonna just
literally highlight sedima forehead here
slightly and my cheekbones just lip it
on my eyes and she's got quite a bit on
her kuipers but in the inner corner of
my eye so that's what I'm gonna do so
I'm going to take my Sigma powder suite
brush I'm going to use the NYX a stroke
of genius palette
I really love this such a really it's
just a gorgeous highlight palette and
I'm just going to take this light shade
right here
before I apply highlight down the bridge
of my nose I'm just going to take some
of the Ben Nye this is a super white
powder and we use this just to highlight
first of all before I apply a natural
highlighter my Mac tuber - okay so for
my nose highlight and the inner corner
of my eye I'm actually going to take
back up get shimmering skin Perfector in
moonstone
okay so I'm just going to line my lips
with mac stripped-down lipliner and then
Cordys got a really glossy lip so I'm
going to take the Anastasi up Beverly
Hills undressed lip gloss so just to
give my lips and extra glossiness I'm
going to take the lip conditioner by Mac
which it's a list I'm just going to
apply some this on top okay so lastly to
finish I'm going to take the mac fix+
and your spring my face but yeah that is
to finish it up I hope you guys enjoyed
