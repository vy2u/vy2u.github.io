my hair my hair it's an absolute hot
mess because I decided to dye it and

scalp so yeah anyway as I'm gonna be
filming this makeup look which is up

box for you and I'll also write the
discount card in case you're running at
them so I'm going to show you how I
would use them in this video
I've had this brush set for quite a
while now and I've really loved them
like the brushes are such high quality I
don't have anything bad to say about
them to be honest I mean like I know how
like some brushes you can buy and like
the Bruce was full out like they're
really annoying like this spikey they
really hurt when you use them on your
face these brushes are so soft and the
bristles don't fall out so in my opinion
it's a good brush so yeah if you wanna
get the brush set I'll link it below
with my discount code and yes if you
wanna find out how i got this makeup
look then please keep watching and
please please just ignore my messy hair
so first of all I'm just gonna carve up
my eyebrow and I'm going to use the
Becca ultimate coverage concealer as
always I don't really like to use
anything else and it's you my favorite
so I'm just going to use this for up and
I feel like and I'm just gonna take this
brush from the set they don't have
specific names or anything but this
one's just kind of like this more
concealer type brush
so then it's going to take the NAS of
radiant creamy concealer and use the
customers to my lid so just taking this
fluffy brush from the set this eye
fluffy brush I'm just gonna I'm really
spotty today because um I went to s bar
and just brought me out in this box I
would steam room to stop it or me up
ends and they're not after couple days
it clears up so at the moment I have
that little spot your face but moral
human it isn't well I'm gonna take show
you the beaches and cream for my makeup
geek eyeshadows which is this shade
right here just for my transition color
if you've not try makeup geek eyeshadows
and I honestly what are you doing good i
right seriously that's so good and
they're not expensive at all so you get
such good quality for money I'm just
turning in my hair day because I just
felt like being more up today and from
the modern renaissance palette or
renaissance I'm not sure Jose Santa
sends you pally I'm gonna take shade
burnt orange this shade right here just
apply that in the crease with the same
brush that I used for this transition
color
so now I'm going to take my Mac 217
brush I'm just because there's not a
brush like this with this out and I'm
going to take shave Morocco from makeup
geek which is this show go ahead take
this chair I'm going to apply it to the
outer corner of my eye and the inner
corner of my eyes
then I'm gonna take this brush from the
brush set which is kind of like a pencil
type brush but it's thicker and I'm
gonna take this shade here which is
called americano from makeup geek and
I'm just gonna apply some of this on the
outer corners you darken it up and the
inner corner as well so now I'm going to
take eyecandy peach fuzz glitter and I'm
going to apply this into the center of
the eye and the arm glitter glue that
I'm using is ash cosmetic and the rush I
reason from the set is one with the
silver end
okay so just did the over off camera and
four lashes and we'll be using the Jimmy
lashes in a door and I've cut them short
I just doing this they were too long and
you can use khojali be for money off
and I said well my lashes dry gonna do
my face so for prime I'm actually gonna
use the backup backlight filter so for
foundation I'm going to set the Giorgio
Armani luminous silk foundation in shade
6.5 and then I'm going to add some of
the cover fixed drops and this is the
end candle light so they're quite dark
from just going to add some of these
drops into spallation just make it a bit
more luminous and then I'm actually
gonna take my foundation brush by Sigma
this is the kabuki brush the f-89 brush
you can use khojali for money off just
because there isn't a foundation brush
in this brush there
so if you can see it up I'm going to
take the NARS radiant creamy concealer
and show you custard
so marching in my beauty blender today
to blend this out and I said I was over
the beep and a vanilla over the beer and
that phase in a brush but for some
reason my brushes gone missing I'm not
sure where it's gone but I was trying to
find it when I was just about to film
this video I can't find it anywhere it's
gone I'm just gonna bake that using my
Laura Mercier translucent powder
so to warm up my face I'm actually going
to take my bare minerals mineral
foundation and shade warm town and I'm
just going to take this fluffy brush
from the brush step
yeah if you use a mineral foundation
over the top of the normal foundation it
just makes the skin look so airbrushed
now let me take my Taylor blue contour
kit and the anchor brush from the brush
they're just his uncle fluffy brush to
contour and I'm going to take shade 6
which is the darkest shade this shade
here
I love this contour brush it's so nice
and soft so just but under my eye now
it's gonna take shave Morocco from
makeup geek the already shade and this
is the short shader brush from the brush
step brush that I'm just gonna run some
of this under my eyes then taking that
darker shade which is the americano I'm
just going to apply some that to the
outer corner just gonna quickly spray my
face with this Smashbox primer all the
time it's a powder I'm going to take the
Laura Mercier highlighter in
indiscretion I'm obsessed with this it's
so good and I'm also going to use this
fan brush from the brush step
then from my lips I'm going to take this
lip injection lip gloss by toothpaste
and this didn't change babe alert
they're really really good these
coasters they're really nice in regards
and being lip injection obviously I'm
guessing they make your lips bigger I
wouldn't really know cuz I've had my
lips done so I can't really tell you if
it publish your lips or not but it feels
like it does so
that is the finished look I hope you
