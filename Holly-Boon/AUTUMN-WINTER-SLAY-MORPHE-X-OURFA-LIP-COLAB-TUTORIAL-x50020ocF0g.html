youtube channel if you're new here then
please subscribe I will love you forever

did this look yesterday and I post it on
Instagram and those of you guys asked me
to film it so I thought film it

I'm Richie looking for it so yeah if you
want to find out how i got this makeup
look then please keep watching all the
products that we linked in the
description box below and please give me
a thumbs up and subscribe love you
forever anyway I'm gonna shut up and
let's go on with the tutorial so first
of all for my transition color I'm going
to take the shade pressed bot and shape
breeches and I'm gonna apply this using
my morphe mm 502 brush then we're gonna
just apply this just above the crease
I'm just going in lightly with a smaller
map product and I'm just gonna build it
up until I'm happy it's the next in my
crease and the outer corner of my eye am
gonna take this shade right here which
is called whiskers and I'm going to
apply this shade using my zoeva to t7
soft to find a brush and I'm just going
to kind of press this in rub and rub
so I'm gonna kind of just press that
right in there
to about halfway I'm not bringing it all
the way in and then I'm gonna pack it on
the outer corner so I'm then gonna take
my morphe M 502 and that shade breeches
and I'm gonna soften the edges you sort
of keep doing it until it's like
completely rendered just keep going back
to that transition color that you use
and then going back to myself to find
out and go back to the shade whiskers
and again I'm just building it up and
then I'm going back to my morphe M 582
and you're going to gently end at the
edge so after that I'm going to take
this cover FX concealer and I'm going to
carve out my lid and I am going to use
my zoeva 2 to 6 brush so I'm just gonna
pile it but if this is back on my hand
this concealer is very full coverage
so that I am going to take some of my
5cm a translucent powder and I'm going
to press that on top there next from
this normally poet I'm going to take
this shade basic and I'm going to apply
that over where I just applied the
concealer see I'm using the same brush
obviously I'm not gonna leave it at
laksa looks messy so unfair so I'm going
to take my morphe M 502 brush and I'm
just going to pull the skin and I'm just
going to color brush over that edge with
this brush just soften it and we want to
blend it blend the line we don't want it
to be a harsh line down the middle of
your eye and I'm going to go into shade
whiskers I'm just going to pack that on
the outer corner again and just like
that so for that line so next I'm going
to take the steel out liquid liner in
the shade Moss which is this very nice
green shade I'm living for it
so now we're going to snatch our way
okay so what I'm gonna do is I'm
actually gonna start in the inner corner
of my eye I'm gonna bring it to about
here and then I'm gonna start from the
end and drag it back I can't talk about
it because I'm gonna it up so I'm
just gonna shut up
I'm just going to take some concealer
and I'm going to clean up the edge
so now we're going to apply lashes
lashes so but before that I'm just going
to apply some mascara and I'm using them
in the Maybelline Big Shot mascara
she does the eyelashes on wearing are
the Koko lashes in the styling war when
do I ever wear anything else somebody is
this Urban Decay eyeliner in the shade
gold brush and I'm gonna apply this in
the crease of my eye I really got this
before I put my lashes on by Ashley
football so I actually forgot about the
step what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
apply this just in that crease there
just to the halfway mark where we've
stopped with the concealer and it's just
a sparkly gold liner it just adds a bit
extra you know so yeah now we can start
on the face so start in the face it's
comes done the eyes so it's a prime I'm
gonna use the fenty beauty primer I'm
just gonna apply this with my fingers
just how it always apply it I'm just
gonna dye it around first and then rub
it in it makes my skin feel so soft I
can explain that honestly at first so
amazing I want to try a new foundation
in this video in the picture I was
wearing the Mac Studio Fix fluid mixed
with the Maybelline fit me matte
poreless and that's been my absolute go
to foundation combo and lately I'm it's
you're obsessed with that but today I'm
going to try a new foundation kind of
pick up this one so I'm gonna try it so
today I'm gonna try out this coverfx
cream foundation I picked this up in the
shade 250 so yeah this is a cream
foundation which looks like this
so I'm gonna take my 104 buffer brush
from zoeva and I'm going to kind of just
swell my brush in here I've had this is
like such full coverage it's really good
so I'm excited
I mean wait my neck is a bit more tan
but once the Foundation's on I couldn't
runs up my face so I'm not too worried
about that
gonna kind of quickly the pipe of death
with the brush and then I'm gonna go
over it with a sponge because I thought
I would despond it kind of takes away
any excess product okay this is full
coverage all right
this is so full coverage hurry no half
read about it but civilian if I can
Utica we try a few more times and I'm
just going to see how it looks with
concealer and bronzer so I'm going to
use two concealers today I'm going to
try out this new one which is the copper
FX concealer in the shade light and then
I'm gonna use my NARS radiant creamy
concealer in the shade ginger because
this one's going to be too light so I'm
going to mix the two together and so
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just
apply some of the NARS radiant creamy
just in the shade ginger and then I'm
just gonna dot some of that cover FX
over the top because I cover FX one
enzyme way too light but it will bite
and Winder a little bit more so rich
right so there's a very full coverage i
when I put on my eyes my eyelids it was
like very full coverage yes so now I'm
gonna just go in with some of the cover
FX I just thought a little bit
underneath like that it's tiny but if
this goes a long way so I mean I produce
up like way too much anyway so I'm
actually I'm gonna use a Beauty Blender
today I know I always use a Sigma sponge
and I've been using to be good enough
for like the last week and I do think I
prefer my Sigma sponge just prefer the
shape of it and also it's a lot softer
because these are really soft most
everyone is like next level
stop because it blends out nicely
so definitely given me some coverage
definitely it's hard to tell because I
have mixed here concealers it's going to
be hard to tell but I am going up to
just pick up the right shade in this and
try it on its own but I think it's
probably gonna be better to mix it
because it's pretty gonna read to full
coverage by its after the point much
we're gonna crease so I mean mixing it
with another concealer is probably the
best way to do it anyway that looks
really nice that looks really good under
my mother if a peridot I'm using the RCM
a translucent powder I've been using so
a few days
since I got it and I love it it's so
good and it's so affordable the only
problem is it's very messy but I'm gonna
get a separate container some of you
guys said to put it in your dorm SDA
container which is such a good idea so
I'm gonna definitely do those it's very
messy but it's really good it's really
good price it's really affordable you
get a lot of powder and it's a really
good parent so I'm gonna just take a
separate sponge this is a different one
I always have one for creams and one for
powders and we're just bake my you don't
get any flashback with this powder it's
also a really really good color and like
I said I did have the no color powder
but it was just too light I don't know I
don't know why it was just like too
white but this translucent color one is
so good for me it just works so well
with my skin tone because I'm not rebake
and I'm just gonna kind of press the
powder in but I'm gonna apply this
powder all over my face so I'm just
gonna apply this thin area and then just
opps my eyes I'm gonna do this I do this
because I do get oily also and do it
because this powder is quite thin like
it's not a thick powder it doesn't feel
like super powder if that makes sense it
doesn't make your skin feel tight and
when you apply it if it was just nice
and and it just makes my powder so like
my powder bronzer and stuff when I apply
it goes on a lot nicer if I powder my
whole face it runs up my face and we
need the Mac mineralized skinfinish in
the shade dark deep and I'm just gonna
take this like big fluffy brush from
iconic London I've been using this a lot
recently very like it so I'm just gonna
start with my forehead when you use like
a big fluffy brush it's a lot nicer
because you kind of disperse the product
evenly if that makes sense if your
product if you use like a little brush
and you come in front side and all kind
of just goes in one place it's hard to
kind of then blend it out like lines so
if you use a big brush and you just kind
of just go at it as just disperses a
product really well I'm actually cutting
my hair tomorrow
well it's not my hair it's Mike
get my extensions cut sure and I'm
really scared but I kind of like I love
really long hair for summer when we get
into like warm winter I love to just
like experiment my hair just kite and I
have it sure on star I did this last
year and I had it short for about five
minutes and my mats at home but this
time I'm gonna go like mid length I'm
not gonna go really short so that I can
still kind of tie it up I can still kind
of do like a barn and stuff because when
it's too short that's when I was like
struggling because I couldn't really
time the hair up I couldn't read you any
style I had to just have it down one
time and it was kind of damaging to my
hair because I had to kind of blow dry
and strain it everyday to be able to
wear it down so I think mid length will
be a good length because then talk I
said I could still tie it up but I just
think it'll frame my face a lot better I
love my long long long long long
extensions I live barrette but it's not
summer anymore so I wanted to switch it
up okay I think the foundation it's
really good now I've applied the bronze
or in the concealer and stuff it looks
really okay that looks so much better
now Ron stop that looks so much bad I'm
just gonna do a bit of contouring quick
and I'm gonna uses pure Diaries cuanto
Diaries I'm gonna set shade mystery
which is a dark shade I'm gonna use my
cream cheap brush from zoeva the 1 to 8
and I'm gonna just console just under my
cheekbone here I think when it comes to
contouring it's always best to bronze
first because it's like when you do your
eye makeup and you do your transition
color you don't go straight in with a
dark shade you always just kind of build
it up so I think we've continent with
the face it's exactly the same right you
want to go in with a bronzer before you
go straight in with a dark contacts it's
going to be hard to blend it out so if
you was going over bronze first it'll be
a lot easier when you're going to blend
out your contour I really like this
concept by I used it the other night and
when I went out in London with Imogen I
used their annum
I really like it it's a really good
contour palette I like the shades in it
they're not too warm and they're not too
cool and I partly shades that to
Cooksley just look to gray on me I only
just had to start fake tan in again and
my turn my natural turn lasted so long
because I went on so many holidays this
year my tax return lasted so long and
then when he just had to start fake
talking again and I'm just like I just
need another holiday I can't do it with
this fake sound is like I don't know
just annoying
so for blush I'm gonna use this benefit
California I always use this I love it
it smells like holiday as well and I'm
gonna use this on my Zoey about 186
powder brush yeah this brush it's kind
of like it's quite so like it's not too
much it's not too intense and I just
love the way it smells like holiday
smells like coconuts I'm just some cream
and just holiday you know I just think
blush like makes such a difference
I used to never wear blush you guys are
follow me for a while I used to never
wear blush ever and now I like I can't
not wear X I just don't I just feel like
I look weird about it now it's crazy
let's finish up the eyes we're just
going to do the same move done on the
top to the bottom so first we're going
to take the shade birches and press pop
on my morphe m5o - I'm going to apply
this underneath every ass but like it's
impossible to do under eye right gonna
open it up a weird face it's like
impossible okay then on my stuff definer
brush from zoeva the two to seven we're
going to take the shade whiskers which
is a darker brown shade that we use on
the outer corner I'm gonna run this
underneath there quite close to my lash
line so I can get up and I'm going to go
back to my morphe M 502 and buff that
right now I'm gonna do it with my Stila
waterproof liquid liner I'm gonna run
this just under my waterline so rather
something with a stone just underneath
my waterline
so yeah just under the waterline we're
playing this so then for in my waterline
I'm gonna take its copper FX pencil and
this is in the shade NX deep which is
just like a dark brown I'm gonna run
this in my waterline so then to finish
up the eyes for the bottom mascara I'm
gonna use my Mac extended play mascara
this is my favorite favorite potent
mascara for bottom lashes I watch what
I'm trapped in his videos ages ago and
she used this
and I bought it ages ago and I haven't
stopped using it for so long I'm like
addicted to it
I used it ages ago like probably a year
ago and then I just forgot how good it
wasn't that your buy it again and then I
bought it again like a few months ago
I don't use anything else but what I'm
not is so I'm gonna do my lips first and
then we're gonna do the highlight so I'm
just itching to uses this lip columns
okay so for my lip color I'm using this
morphe collab with this LA makeup is I'm
really bad at pronouncing names I don't
want to pronounce the name wrong but I'm
gonna link it below for you guys
she's amazing she's a massive LA makeup
and she's just amazing I look so just
insane I love them so yeah so more FS
will take the lip liner
so we're going to take the liquid
lipstick
this color is just to die for I'm
literally obsessed
my highlight will take the iconic London
illuminator drops in the shade original
as you guys know life is fun to me for a
while I love these job so much and
Hannah stopped using them I know it's
the difference for my using them so
going back to them so I'm gonna just
apply some of these on my sponge and
then I'm gonna just apply it straight on
the skin you want to press these in and
up Rob because you read I wanted to stir
any product underneath because we've put
powder underneath as well and your prior
liquid on top you really needs to be
careful and just need to press it in
okay so next I'm going to take the
nikkietutorials and Oprah collab
highlight in the shade glow go so the
brush I'm using is the morphe M 510 just
one of my favourites to use took my
highlight and I'm just gonna buy this
whole island
and I'm just gonna apply some in this
highlight to my brow bone then lastly I
want to take my Urban Decay all nighter
setting spray to set my makeup in place
