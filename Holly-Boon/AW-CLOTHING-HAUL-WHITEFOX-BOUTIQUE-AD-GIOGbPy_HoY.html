because I've got a million cold so I'm
gonna sound minion and if I keep
sneezing I'm really sorry I'm really
sorry
so I teamed up with white folks boutique
to bring you a clothing haul I love
white fox Boutique so much as you guys
already know if you've been following me
for a while I literally love their
clothes so much I love the swimwear I
just love everything it's just so bomb
so anyway I first of all picked up these
leather look trousers they're
high-waisted which I love I love
high-waisted trousers and I love the
details on the side of these and I loved
it has the detail on both sides and it's
got the zip at the back which is nice as
well like I love that they're stretchy
because is this appetizer that I would
wear to grab some food and when I go out
for food I need stretch because I get
bloated so on each stretch and these are
stretch so what up that and so I did get
these the size what's missing at these
small they get these inside small locus
of the do stretch I'm a size 8 UK and
the UK size 8 so I'd say an 8 to 10 your
fitting is easy so obviously we're
coming into that autumn winter so I want
you to stock up on jumpers so I picked
up a few so the first one I got this is
for that one I already have this one in
white and you guys always ask me where
it's from
it's from white fox and I just picked up
in black because I thought it looked so
good with those trousers yeah I paired
the black level ik trousers with this
black chomp and knit jumper which is
like so nice I love you Sean for so much
like I said I already have it in white
and I live in it so I'm glad I've
actually got a black one now cuz I was
wearing it too much I was like and I was
thinking I'm about people going right
why does she keep wearing that John
better so I've got it in black now it's
all good I also picked up these boots
which I love these so much and they're
so comfortable I was shocked I think
they're a con because they've got this
big hill and I love they've got the gaps
on the side they've got the lace-up bit
at the front the zip at the back we've
also got the Steve's hell at the top I
love these so much and he's excited with
those leather trousers and I would wear
these with those other trousers with
black jeans I'm gonna wear these all
time so then I picked up a couple more
of these John pair these are slightly
different to that one that was more kind
of like off the shoulder that black
and then this one is more kind of like a
v-neck that it comes off by his
shoulders which I love so I picked it up
in white white is bad with me because I
mean white doesn't stay white because I
like to fake tan and so I mean this
pretty weights they work very long but
now she's more like a cream I'm gonna
taste like a proper white it's not a
cream color I picked this up in a small
to medium and then I also got it in gray
which I love which is the exact name it
in gray I love jumpers um I loved on
this when it comes to autumn winter I
just live in jumpers like Nick jumpers
and jeans it's just all I ever wear see
I just really wanted to stock up on
jumpers so I mean that's three jumpers
and I've got more jumpers coming then I
decided to get this dress I love this
dress so much I just really like the
detail of it I like the way looks like
it's been cut if that makes sense
like it looks like it's been cut around
the front and the sides and I love that
has these really thin straps I would
wear this on a night out with some lace
up shoes and then it'll probably just
chuck a jacket over the top like a long
jacket like a long water for one I have
like a baby cream one which I think will
it rain out of this buy love this and
the back it's just straight straight
color that and but I love this dress
it's quite thick as well which is quite
nice it's not really thin and also I
didn't want a bra with this and it's not
see-through so I mean
halle-fucking-lujah because I find it
hard to find things that are wide that
aren't see-through and this is a secret
so yeah if you don't know wherever I'm
with this didn't have to and I got this
in a size 8 UK a which is a small okay
next this is quite a summery dress I
will admit but I just say were so cute I
can't help myself
so it's this stripy pink and white dress
and this is kind of more of like a day
dress rather than an evening dress I
probably won't wait on a night out I'd
probably wear this if I was going on
holiday with some sandals or something
like that like a day dress um but it's
so cute I love her ass off the shoulder
it's not really autumn winter ah I love
it I can't help myself it's key and I'll
just keep it friending on weather okay
so I am obsessed with these types of
body suits lately like I am obsessed
obsessed if I could have one of these in
every car
I will I will because I love them so
much and so I haven't these a little
while ago in a baby pink color which was
from a different brand and then I saw
the white fox do them and I was like yes
because I really wanted these in
different colors and I couldn't find
them anywhere so I'm so glad that they
have them so this is the bodysuit so
it's black it's long-sleeve and it has
this bit that does up at the front it's
a v-neck and it kind of just like it's
like Papa's so you can undo it you can
do it up you can do it up a little bit
whatever you want to do I sent away it's
like I did pair this with some white
jeans but I do tend to wear body suits
with joggers so I know it sounds weird
but I would probably wear this with some
high-waisted black joggers like skinny
ones obviously like skinny black joggers
with this bodysuit with four recent
trainers and sunglass back sunglasses
that's probably what I would wear it
with I did pick up some white jeans from
white folks so I wanted to show you what
it would allow with jeans but yeah I
like to pair body suits with joggers
like it's like my thing I like to do it
I do it a lot yes so these are the jeans
I picked up that is white boyfriend
jeans and they have this rip on the back
just below the bomb on one of the sides
on the left side and yeah I just rolled
up the bottoms chucks and some trainers
and chucked on about and the sunglasses
I love boyfriend jeans as well cuz I
love rolling up the bottom of them and
putting trainers on and I also think
they look really good when you roll them
up and then you were at lace-up heels
that looks really good as well but yes I
picked up those white jeans and yes with
that bodysuit I would probably wear that
more so with some black joggers why I
love it okay so we actually did forget
to try this body suit on and I'm just
going to show you it now so it's off the
shoulder like that it's long sleeves and
it's got this popper detail here but you
can't actually do it it's just for show
which is cute so again it's like often
told like that and I would definitely
wear this with something like
high-waisted
gray Duggar's skinny joggers and
trainers like 100% that's why we're if
also I would wear this with some
high-waisted back doing
or black trousers and some heroes if I
were to dress it up a little bit but
more so I would put aversive jobbers
because that's why I do body suits and
Dragons is deciding that I live for next
I've got this jumper and it's a cropped
jumper and it's got quite big sleeves at
the sleeves whoa is that makeup already
know gonna get a heart attack yeah it's
got these big sleeves which I love I
love that D toughing Oh looks really
elegant it's kind of more like a dressy
jumper that makes sense like I feel it
if you paired this was like some
high-waisted white trousers and then
some heroes it would look really nice so
I feel like this is something that you
could dress up and dress down
it's really thick it's just really cozy
I love jumpers I just love them so we've
got the same jumper and I got it in
black I love this one black it's just
like muscle okay my soul is black I like
black I dress in black nice this time
black or white mice a time I mean I did
you stress in black but all that all the
time with black hair and I was like mm
just a bit much just a bit depressing I
need to add some other colors into my
life quite a plain person when it comes
to clothes I don't like loads of these
how I don't like loads of like patterns
I just like playing stuff yeah that just
talks is quite edgy I don't like things
that I've got like loads going on you
know that mean place this next outfit
it's kind of like a loungewear set this
is saying that I'll go around my house
and if you just want to look cute you
know what I mean like someone just like
to look you in my house okay I just do
I said cute for me and if it's coming
over I want to look kid you not I mean
when i come Chilean but I'm still key so
I've got this red and white bodysuit
I love this it's got baby going on it
imogen maybe yeah um I think it's so
cute I had one of these fun pretty
little thing and I don't really like it
because the straps weren't tight enough
and not my boobs have just fall out of
it which was really annoying but I did
like the detail of it so this one's
perfect because it's got adjustable
straps and it comes up high at the back
like a low back and it's probably
supportive it's not see-through so you'd
have to wear bra bra Avex not
see-through and yeah it's really cute I
love that and it's all girls in the size
medium I here are the shorts which
they're so cute and they're really
comfortable and they're stretchy as well
I love them for just like lounging
around the house and so I did get the
matching top as well as go with the
shorts which is halloki and it's just
like a short sleeve crop and yet it goes
with the shorts so that was really cute
matching twins that I already have this
in pinky nude and whatever kind of don't
have it in like a camel color I have
these sets have three of these sets now
I love them they're really comfortable
also with this baby girl bodysuit again
I would wear with probably black joggers
or something like that the last thing I
got was this t-shirt which I love it
says the end on it it's got some holes
in it I just think it's cute and I like
to tie it up like I like to tie it on
the side I always do that on my t-shirts
like biking teachers I always do that
and I just think it shows off the detail
on these trousers so yeah that is
everything that I've got from whitefox
