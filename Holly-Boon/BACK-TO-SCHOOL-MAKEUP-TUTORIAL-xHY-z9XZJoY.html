to school dirt crazy boobs blows have
you been asking me for this so just
something really simple that's not going
to take those the time but looks nice
that's what going to do so how much
should have my eyebrows for once I felt
like I should leave it in sometimes I
feel like you don't get to see me do it
because I did do an eyebrow tutorial but
I don't know I'm going to leave it in
anyway so I'm going to use there
and it stays here beverly hills dipbrow
pomade in ash brown to be honest and I
use my friends dip brow and chocolate
the other day and I prefer the way looks
tomorrow brow so I'm going to order that
but for now I'm using ash brown and the
reason why and with brush by is a weaver
I just basically start by underlining my
eyebrow and over not over lining but
just carving out how I want it to look
and then I just fill it in
a dating to apply too much product in
this front be here cuz it already - Nick
- you are so kind of just right out the
tiniest bit just whatever is left on my
brush I'm just going to cover up my
eyebrow and venes the Becca ultimate
coverage concealer in shade banana and
my mac 242 brush
from start you my bunny I'm your clock
from if a little bit of powder on that
so I'm just taking the door messy a
powder
I'm just gonna hurt that online dead
quickly because I'm going to take the
Becca backlight filter I'm just going to
replace on this and then for foundation
I'm going to take the mac studio fix
fluid in NC 44 and I'm just going to
apply this using my Sigma kabuki brush
and then this is the F if F 89 brush we
can use khojali a for money or any Sigma
brushes
I mean when I was at school and we went
out wear makeup like we went to school
make when they'd party or make a weapon
to take it off and any night before
Nexus and a great set of tourism
RealPlayer and then the same thing would
happen the teacher would be like go
ahead hit your maker bar but apparently
and the people that go to my school now
that younger and stuff but I spoke to a
couple of them they did someone make up
for prom she said that they changed the
rule now so girls can wear makeup
because it kind of makes them feel
better about themselves so that's
obviously like really good that they've
changed that because I feel like it's
just makeup is not affecting your
learning or anything so I don't see the
problem a bit but I'm gonna use the nah
this is a radiant creamy concealer in
shade custard feel like you don't need
to do all of this obviously for school
that you could just pick concealer of
runs around you don't need to put like
full coverage foundation or anything but
I just wanted to I'm just going to blend
that in with my concealer blend kabuki
brush by Sigma this is the F 79 brush
I'm just going to set that using my lure
mentor a translucent powder
it's crazy how like American schools are
so different to English you guys quit
high school of um kindergarten or
something every night but like I don't
know what that means but we just help
like year like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 11 and
like somehow some come some schools have
like middle school and after school I
fit in America like your things I
compete until I am so for bronze I'm
actually going to take the bareMinerals
is Matt this is actually a foundation
but I like to use it to warm up my face
and although this Foundation's I look
hot warm already but oh well um but this
is the immune tan and it is really good
like if you really want that doll like
like skin and using oka powder mineral
foundation over the silver mini
foundation just gives up
dim noises finish ever like it just
makes your skin look like doll like
confetti airbrush so um I mean if you
want to slay the out of school and
look like a doll and this is the way
forward people do like that school
makeup looks like a more dramatic stuff
and everyone's been like that's too much
the school what I've done well not very
like where were the you will not if
you want to go to school with like
whoops if you want to go to school back
rainbow eyebrows and you do that you
know you do that I used to wear so much
makeup school and you see spike you take
it off a bit sorry
okay anywhere I was going to take the
Stardust palette by Vegas no to face
things now it's going to take this shade
here I'll have this product for so long
it's like a mess I'm just going to
initially apply some of this in the
crease
like the attention girl I know you but
you're everything I wanted
- my god
those ones have done that I'm just going
to literally apply is kind of called
showgirl which is like a shimmery golden
it she's going to find that all over the
lid
loofa mascara I'm gonna set L'Oreal
telescopic good a purse with this if
you've already got renounce lashes then
you don't use next step I'm going to
wear false lashes because I well design
my eyelashes are just really gonna see
sure coming in so so I'm gonna wear
these ones and these are called a door
by Demi eyelashes I do have a discount
code which I do believe is like holy B
or just Holly okay remember but I'll put
it right here somewhere yeah I mean
don't let anyone tell you you can't wear
high school that I'm sorry affecting
your education if you've got like girl
when I snatch to the boats all right the
highlight or you think we're what the
hell you want don't let someone tell you
you're wearing too much makeup because
honey there's no such thing
I say dad which it called minimums going
to run some of that under my eye this
really rock playing a bit neat whack
that under there light that and be both
and then I'm just gonna put some nuts
gum just got one all that brass with the
hair um this with this shade this inner
corner to Baja I'm going to spray my
face with some primer water so now you
need your highlight to be beaming to the
gods to the pool map blinds like they
need to blind the bullies okay so
brilliant got to come to you if you've
got a beam in highlight because I don't
wanna get blinded so you need your
highlight to be blind in okay anyway so

quickly actually those of you were
coming in my last video saying that I
don't reply to YouTube comments it's not
that it's like I don't tend to look
through them that much like when I first
I remember a video is it for the
comments if anyone's asked me a question
I will always reply and but they don't
tend to look as much just because
something really nasty and it just winds
me up and have to bite my tongue so I
just need time to read them as much now
but if you have any questions please
tweet me because I see easiest place for
me to reply like if you have a TV show

certified so please if you have any
