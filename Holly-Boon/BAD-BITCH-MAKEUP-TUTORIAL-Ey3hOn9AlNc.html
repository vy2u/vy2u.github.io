because it takes me so long to do my
eyebrows but you want me to do an
obviously to reel on an updated eyebrow
routine and let me know so next to carve
out my brows and to prep my eyelids I'm
going to be using the Maybelline the
array die perfect and cover concealer in
the shade nude and I did take this one
with mine and I just switched to like
that and the product comes out the top
and I just use this brush and I'm using
the Sigma cream color b-58 brush and
then yeah I'm just going to bring this
concealer down onto the lid as well some
white eyeshadow base I'm just going to
set that quickly before it creases and
using my Laura Mercier translucent
powder and my Sigma fake precision brush
I'm just going to press some powder on
top it's better to press the powder all
over then you don't want to rub or
anything to disturb the product
underneath so you don't want to do that
so first we're going to take my Jackson
Hale morphe palette and I'm going to
take this shade right in for my
transition color and I'm going to use my
morphe M 504 brush you don't have to
have these palettes that I'm using to
create this look these look these colors
that I'm using are so comments you can
get them in like so many different
palettes so don't really have to buy
these palettes to do this look as you do
and these are just the ones that will
kind of like on the top of my things I
just reached for these ones
so next I'm going to take the master
palette by Mario which is the Anasazi
Beverly Hills palette and I'm going to
take this shade Isabel which is the show
right here and I'm going to use my
morphe M 502 brush I'm going to apply
this shade in the crease and then go
back to my morphe m5o for just blend out
okay then next from this Mario palette
I'm going to take the shade Violeta
which is brown shade right here and
we'll use my max two to one brush and
I'm going to lightly apply this in the
crease and the outer corner of my eye
and I'm just going to build it up but
I'm just going to apply little bit at a
time I'm going to bring it into the
halfway
okay next I'm going to take some
concealer and I'm going to carve out my
lid and we use my Maybelline the eraser
eye concealer which I use and then I go
so just with the edge of the container
I'm just going to drag it out slightly
I'm going to end it in any way with
shadow but it just helps a little bit
more you just kind of pull it out before
you do that as well and then let me set
that concealer with Monroe Mercier
powder so and then we take the same
brush latisha to concealer on I've just
wiped the brush I'm going to spray it
with someone like Mario Badescu I'm much
of a sense a facial spray of a low-key
combat and green tea I'm going to spray
some this on the brush and then from the
Mario Kelly I'm going to take this shade
which is called fifth up and I'm going
to apply that just on top of the
concealer
and then I'm going to take my Mac
two-to-one and I'm just going to pull
out the edge so that it blends out after
okay so I'm now going to wing my liner
and I'm going to use my Sigma gel liner
in wicked this is my absolute favorite
and then I'm going to use my sigma t o6
winged liner brush which is also my
all-time favorite and then I'm just
going to line the top of my waterline as
well I'm going to apply this liner right
in my top waterline this because then
when I apply my lashes it helps the
business so from when I leave them
beneath the Koko lashes in a more I love
these eyelashes and the glue I'm using
is the demure lashes eyelash glue I'm
going to stick these on with my tweezers
because it's just a deal
so I are done for now I'm going to wait
until my face is done then finish up my
under-eye and so the first thing I'm
going to do now is prep my skin for my
foundation so lately I've been using
this for slowly rose gold 24 karat gold
infused Beauty oil I thought this is a
bit gimmicky new answer answer are just
four it's just like one of those things
it just looks like it's gonna be really
good but is it really good I was sent
this I never paid for this I can never
bought this because I just wouldn't I
just think it's a bit fancy to know I
mean I would go out on my way to buy it
but I'm so grateful it's got sent me
because I loves this product I believe
my foundation I'm just going to take a
few drops of this in the back of my hand
and then I'm just going to apply it just
around my face I am already but when I
apply that with concealers and stuff and
wellick and my career I just make sure
it just said it a little bit more just
because it makes this just makes my
foundation at bonnaroo next I'm going to
apply some with a benefit professional
to minimize my flaws
then I'm going to apply eye cream and
this is from the Mario Badescu I'm
really sure if I'm saying that right
side depolarizing saying that wrong but
this is the eye cream so I'm going to
apply some this to some of my eyes just
because of a bit of hydration and
swinging using my ring finger I'm going
to press it in my name is by the way
let's she look so bad but I'm just like
holding off because my sister's getting
married at the weekend and all my nails
to be fresh for the wedding so I've just
had like a few days break and I'm going
to get them down like maybe tomorrow or
today not sure I'm going to use my born
this way to Facebook is a foundation in
the shade golden shake this and I'm
going to apply it using my 3d bender
from Sigma
it's so much easier with this sponge to
go around your eyebrows because it's got
this flat edge this is just so much
easier than the beauty blender I am
going to color correct and I just prefer
the way this looks it just gives me a
rebar under and I've been loving this
product at the moment so this is the
benefit for brightening concealer and
I'm just going to apply a little bit of
this to my under eye before I apply my
concealer I'm going to take my 3d been
done I'm just going to press this in and
then embrace my Maybelline be a razor I
perfect and cover then whenever eight
other sides of my nose because I
wouldn't want my nose and we're such
Manos firstly chill today unless you've
had nicely like I've had like three
honestly I don't even know how I mean
functioning right now because I do
really get much sleep last not last
night the night before Eva all the night
before that like I'm where you slept
properly in about three days
so don't know how I'm functioning right
now but I just know what's happening -
where - can't sleep really
oh my god I'm not gonna have a story I
was basically last night this is not my
biggest fear as well I can't really
happen to him Chris is like a big fear
of mine and I'm just like what the fuck
anyway so I've been asleep at about 12
o'clock last night
I always thought quite late anyway so
just like to get emails so and I just
prefer working at night I just because
my house is really quiet and it's just
but easier for me to beat to be creative
and concentrate that make sense I like
to work at nighttime so I went to sleep
about 12:00 and so you at associate
normal and I woke up at 2:15 among in
with a moth flapping in my ear like I
don't think you understand I hate things
that fly I hate things that fly I hate
bugs
I'm such a girl the bug comes near me
that's it like I'm squealing on like
I'll write you seybolt I'm like fucking
running away like I can't do but anyway
so wake up to fucking marks like flying
in my ear so I'm like oh and scream not
going to wake everyone up in my house so
I don't scream or anything but I was
just like sweating like I was like oh my
god but the back so then I spend an hour
trying to sum up my room and I was like
what could I do because it's pitch black
in my room the light on the lights like
far away from my bed so I'm like do i
crawl across the floor like I don't want
it's mostly comedy and we like what
we're going to do so I spend about our
time about 20 minutes like under my
duvet worked in that fuck didn't want to
come out in with my toe Alex's didn't
want this mosque on Melia so much
sweating under my duvet and I was like
right I'm just going to have to do that
over the ideas and just walk across my
bedroom and put a light on and hope that
the moss grows to the light and I can
get them off well so did that turn the
light on and I couldn't find them off by
the web because this must go like where
is it gone I was like kind of keen on
whether where is it took me 15 minutes
to finding it got like behind my TV and
so I turned my light up opened my door
and turned the light on my land in so I
was hoping at the moss will fly out of
my room
so the longest at staring is more for
like another like 20 minutes like please
just fly out like please just fly out I
can I'm like literally looking at it
like please just get the fuck out my
room and and then and then I firstly
again I must have fell asleep again I
don't actually I literally don't
remember me but I must of not for long
though it wasn't long because I looked
at the time any wasn't but is pretty
like 10 minutes I first meet for woke up
I couldn't see them off I can find it I
need to wear it gone I was like oh my
god what the fuck and we're going to do
now so like our guys I slept under my
duvet absolutely boiling hot come fall
asleep I was so hot I didn't want to
like come at my device I was just so
scared
and then I woke up at five o'clock and I
just I couldn't go actually I was just
acting paranoid I was too paranoid that
this mouse was going to get me like I
just think as I've seen things on the
internet like people getting mops like
in their ear and like the most like
actually inside there and that's like my
biggest fear like when I was at my old
job we used to watch sick like Reese
de-what sick videos on YouTube like
people popping spots and just sick staff
like I don't even know why we did that
but also music me or work but I would
actually used to do any work because you
to do shit like that and we watched I
watch this video once and it was like
this girl like trying to pull this mop
out of my boyfriend's and I must've got
like in his ear she was like getting
tweezers trying to get it out oh my god
and since that that's like my worst
nightmare so I waking up to a loss like
stuff around my ear was like I wasn't
even imagines that she's like way to cry
I was like oh my god why did this happen
to me she she think that any one of my
window wipers I don't know where this
moth came from because my daughter was
closed in my room so the moth must have
just been in here from what the daytime
I must have had my window open it and
during the day and it also come in there
Graham's gonna take a different sponge
and I'm going to use my Laura Mercier
translucent powder this is set that I
thought I could sleep with like earplugs
in like just something in my ears so
that I can know happen because I'm just
so proud right now well I also saw this
thing once this is how sick like today
anyway again at my old work when we saw
seasick videos I saw I saw this video
and this guy had a good big spot on his
arm and he has a great other views
lobster Ivan nyah he just had it popped
right and loads of little spiders came
out basically a spider had laid eggs in
his arm and whose it was spiders came
out the spot and I was like if that was
me I would have a panic attack or
something like that literally terrifies
me I just can't deal with that type of
shit I just can't
Oh God the guy didn't even look like he
was bothered as I brought the farc I big
cry my eyes I had a panic attack
I'm so dramatic but I just hate bugs and
I hate like I don't kill them they like
a heart kill bugs I just I feel bad I
can't do that and if I kill them I do
feel bad but I just moved
I just creeped me out anyway good they
are iconic London pigment stick in the
shade 4.1 just to warm up my face
because it you know me I love a warm as
fuck sake yeah like just be careful when
you go to sleep don't even try see the
window could you save risk it stays even
risk it
it's just know that I could be
absolutely boiling hot like swept here
like are climbing asleep I wasted my
windows because I'm so scared
something's going to come in not a
spider or you wake up and you got the
caster's walking bugs life in your room
I just can't deal with that I just I
survived reunion damage or anything say
no oh God now we know in the comment
section if you've had anything crazy
haven't you like you've had a bug in
your area or like and you can see it by
like just let me know yeah I just can't
believe that God has spiders in his arm
that literally you've got open and try
and find out on YouTube now like - I
need to mix so fucked if you don't mind
watching things like that like you need
to watch it just type in like God would
describe it's in his arm or something I
don't know
because society it gives me a good
normal spot and then they popped it in
these little no I can't find anything
quiet
I think spiders are the worst because
they run so fast I just like so quick
and I'm so you see one and then it's
just like on the other side of the room
and you're like what the park and
they're just like black and like their
legs and so I took on I'm going to put
some this Urban Decay makeup prep lip
love on my lips just smell it - just
really a bit dry another dry lip life
bit foundation on the lips as well
non-exact I'm going to take my
mineralized skinfinish from Mac in deep
dark I'm going to just press this as
it's off my cream contour where's Nora
cream corn so it's like cream warm up we
face my star sign I'm accounts are we
are very care
in we're very loving very loyal it could
be picking myself oh hey oh I'm just
contouring muscle
I'm just contouring by the way of my
analyzers over here is contour kit and
I'm just going to bake under my contour
cuz I want it to be sharp AF cut the
mitch my contour to cut herbage go it's
really playing it's on me we just think
you like the Reese's and I'm like one of
the people I'm quite sarcastic and I'm
quite like the jaw I'm just joking I
talk about all the time people take me
serious and I'm like I'm going to take
my Mario Paint I'm going to take the
shade in the barrel on my morphe m500 -
and I'm going to run this underneath my
iron this is like my absolute grocery
look I do this look whenever I go out
really just because it just I think it's
so flattering for my eye color and yeah
I think it is the most flattering look
for me I just love where these kind of
shades warm shades I mean who doesn't
we all love a good warm look daily okay
so then I'm going to take the shade of
Violetta on my Mac two to one and then
run this under knee foot closer to my
lash line anyway I'm going to use my
English eyeliner in 77 in my bottom
waterline just because I threw out this
last a lot longer in my waterline then
the Sigma one done I don't like using
this on top I find it really difficult
to use it riche sticky
I'm just not not a huge fan of this
eyeliner and it transfers on me as well
I used to love it because it's so black
but then you just kept transferring me
and have you got oily eyelid so that was
afar so i'm looking back the other day
and i was like why the fuck did i stop
using that because this mascara used to
be like my ride-or-die for bottom lashes
it's like so good and I just stopped
buying it I don't really know why like I
know I didn't buy it again
I used it once to buy it but I use like
one whole thing and I just didn't buy
again I don't know what so I think the
other day and I was I'm going
again because I love that and I usually
yesterday I was like where is it's been
like why I stopped why why I seriously
why so this girl leave it to dry and I'm
going to apply another coat on top so
I'm going to snatch my own in the
meantime as I make this dark day for my
Anasazi of color and I'm using lies it
might medium sweeper brush I'm going to
run this down the front of my nose just
because I want to pivot in there and
bring it right up to the brow right down
this lighting is a little bit of product
you don't want to apply too much because
it's going to be really hard to bend it
out so I just kind of pry little bit and
then try and blend it in with the same
brush going back and forth and then I'm
just going to wipe this brush and I'm
going to take the banana shade down the
front windows and then just on the tip
like that it's good dust off this powder
broke sure I just realized I was
bronzing that brush or whatever so done
this is a clean one this other got
foundation on this is a clean when she's
got the powder on this end but this end
I'm just going to press over it to blend
it a little bit more and then because I
thought the oven put bronzer there I'm
just going to go back in with that
powder forever
just leave that there just leave that
there for a minute
I bet I bet you can guess what I'm gonna
use for highlight I bet you can't guess
I'm going to use the iconic sensitive
even it drops in the shade original I'm
going to put some these on the back of
my hand like I always do like a broken
record
lowering and I'm going to use my 3d
bender I'm going to press these into the
sponge fast and then apply them on the
face so flick is snaps just fuck so I'm
going to take my mix way lip liner in
this shade London long -
and then for my liquid lipstick I'm
going to use those of colors knock on
wood and then lastly I'm going to spray
my very own sq facial spray with aloe
cucumber and green tea this is so much
better than fixed glass
I can't even explain I love this so much
it gives you that really obviously it
just makes just going to come around
just make sure the skin light skin again
got rid of all the excess powder it just
makes your skin look amazing so it just
makes it just makes all the products
come out in someone it just looks
thinner so I just love that spray so
much better than Iran so that is the
finished look I hope you guys enjoyed
