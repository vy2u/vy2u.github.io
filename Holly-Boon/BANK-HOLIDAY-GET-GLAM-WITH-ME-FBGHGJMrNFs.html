well and I hope you're having a good
weekend
a good long holiday weekend and also
Hyatt renew here my name is Polly boon
welcome to my youtube channel I thought
I do like a get glam with me type of
video Nikita Torres does he sucks at me
I love watching them um and I just
thought it'd be quite cool because it's
bank holiday weekend and if you guys are
going out tonight you can sit here and
get ready with me and if you're not
getting ready you can just chill just
chill with me because I'm putting up in
a violent Sunday I'm being honest I feel
like I'm you know it's so much when I
was younger now I'm older I just
obviously I probably probably been
that's being honest I really I'm just
getting something out too much and some
just a wreck so I'm gonna fit on my
brows first and I'm gonna use my NYX
micro brow pencil in the shade black I
love this it's my favorite so I'm just
gonna underline my brow I'm like the mom
when when we go out like when he's got
my friends like I'm always the mom I'm
always the one who makes sure people get
over okay and I'm always the one that's
like drunk but I still I'm still me I
still know what I'm doing I'm like the
most responsible one it's burning and I
just go through my brow and just spit it
in then starting with brow I'm just
gonna fill it in really lightly I think
she don't apply like hardly any pressure
when he gets this up my brow I like to
keep it as natural as possible but just
fit it in a tiny bit okay so after that
I'm gonna put some clear brow gel
through my brows this is the Anastasi
above me here this one it's my
ride-or-die the only thing that keeps my
brows in place all day I'm gonna do a
look that I always get asked to do in a
video and I probably done this before at
some point most likely but I don't think
I've done this look in a while but
something that every time I wear ones
that I can use your videos so that's
what I'm gonna do so I'm gonna first
take my P Louise eyeshadow base I'm
gonna put some in the back of my hand
and I do believe that Paige is coming up
with more shades in this which is
amazing and also like a bigger tube as
well which is good so this is my
my 75 brush I'm just gonna until I my
brow first and then I'm just gonna press
this on or over the lid so just twitched
over to my Mac 195 brush because I
prefer this brush for this about the
nuts it one so I'm going to use my
morphe 35o palette which is the 35o
palette but it just all matte shades
which looks like this and I first of all
use this shade right here and I'm just
using this on my morphe oh this is just
one this is a brush it doesn't have a
number on it I'm just going to start to
apply this just above the crease and
then I'm going to wipe off the excess
and the back of my hand and I'm gonna
just start to blend the edge so I'm just
gonna do circular motions backwards and
forwards as well oh my god on Twitter I
saw this girl the / happy vendor in the
microwave I literally like fried I was
just dead I was Poppa laughs and it was
so funny I think you're supposed to put
the beauty blender in soapy water and
then put it in the microwave and it's
supposed to clean your Beautyblender but
this girl didn't realize that she put
her Vita Brenda in the microwave just on
his own and it lit she fried I was dead
it was so funny I'm gonna take this
shade right here which is the reddish
brown and this is my mac t17 brush and
I'm gonna press this in the outer corner
and up into the crease of it halfway I'm
gonna press you on and then I'm gonna
take this brush that I used for that
transition color and I'm going to dip
into this bright orange in the corner
here it's gonna pick up a little bit of
that I'm gonna blend the edge this brown
so I'm just going to do the same as
always a circular motions and backwards
and forwards
we love a warm I we all love a warm I we
love it
has anyone watching 5-star Hotel hey
some of you have I'll it she loved it is
so funny Joey Essex just makes me die
the stuff that comes out of his mouth
with his like his stitches I hope you
witnessed the jamon employee of the
season I hope he wins it I was in the
last one yet I think it's the last one
where they get employee of the season
haven't seen that one yet
well it's just been so good as watching
the so funny okay so I'm gonna darken up
even more on the outer corner so I'm
gonna go for this color right here I'm
gonna keep this just in the outer corner
that I'm not going to bring it up into
the middle crease sure what's really
weird is I used to wear a winged liner
all the time and now I just prefer not
to and that sounds really worried about
I'm just going for a faith but I just
prefer myself about when tying on cuz I
used to like I couldn't do a make up
about doing away I haven't that person
when I go out I spend so long getting
ready like I let you take a day to get
ready he faked had on he said do me hair
makeup just everything you know I mean
you'd have time to choose your outfit I
thought I us girls we spend so long
getting ready for a night out and then
we still run out of time like it still
gets that last like 10 minutes
and we're doing what we're gonna wear
and we show so now we still have a drink
and we've been getting ready all day and
we still not ready on time
it's mad it's madness I'm gonna take
someone that Peter he's based on the
back of my hand and my Mac one-nine-five
brush and I'm gonna cut half my crease
with this I love cut my critically I
just think it makes the eye makeup look
so neat
sprayed in it's pouring the old man is
snoring okay I talking stand that so
latrese's Mike he said this me he went
to bed and bumped his head and couldn't
get up in the morning I came why though
if you're not me and what's that what to
do the rain or is it's not supposed to
be like I don't understand on his day I
think I'm just proper thinking to me not
a day visit so I'm gonna use a matte
shade and we're gonna use a shimmer and
I just like all my eyes when I do this
kind of low your something off
everything I'm gonna go for this color
which is the lightest color in the
palette and i'm gonna use my blank
canvas a 42 brush and i'm gonna just
press this on top of that face do the
same on this side so i'm just gonna
press just basically set in that face so
we're gonna blend this line now so i'm
going to take this brush first of all
I'm just gonna go backwards and forwards
maybe that line I haven't put any extra
product on this brush
she's just what's left over on the brush
and then I'm gonna take this flat brush
with the darkest color that he is I'm
gonna go over that slightly and then I'm
gonna I'm just gonna wear it and blend
it what I'm gonna do is take my NYX and
vinyl liquid liner and I'm gonna line my
lashline needs to get placed in the row
for this
okay don't worry about this part for now
because it's gonna go over it and sec
but before I do that I'm going to take
my last student drama Joe line up from
Maybelline and when I apply some line
item s top waterline I always do this as
you guys know this is right and not
waterline
no go you just want it all black okay so
with this black liner here I'm just
gonna go in with this brush which has
that dark color on it and I'm just gonna
defuse that a little bit okay so mr.
price and bad old buying the mascara I
had these fluffy ones on earlier I have
no idea what he's from they've just did
my little eyelash thing they've already
been used so when I price them House of
brush eyelash glue to them and let them
dry down for a bit while we do our face
so I'm just gonna apply some of this
which is a firming night cream I wear it
in a diner where happens and Eve my
primer it's just I just love this cream
it's so good it's expensive but I
absolutely love it it's just amazing it
smells so good
so next I'm gonna use my wire sell or
ours primer just prime ways everything
lately I absolutely love it I feel like
I never used to feel like primer worked
for me and so I never really used to
bother with it too much just moisturizes
stuff underneath my foundation but this
primer isn't that example it keeps me a
little free it keeps on makeup on all
day it's so good and also really really
smooth my pores so like wonderful my
foundation on top my pores are like
non-existent so worth the money
obviously okay so for my foundation I'm
going to use my Maybelline 24 hour stay
I love this foundation I'm just obsessed
I wish you love it and I'm going to
apply this with my damp Beauty Blender
I'm going to do some festival makeup
looks this week I'm just really excited
to start doing festival stuff like get
all the chunky glitters out and just
chop it all over your face I'll just
call away so next what can see it I'm
going to use my Laura
see a okra longwear concealer loved this
and I'm gonna use a shade 3w I love
everything about this concealer also
this is waterproof okay so I went
swimming in with Todd and I had dark
circles under my eyes and I was like
just gonna put a tie with it and see it
on why it's because I just look lock up
and punished in the eyes I went in the
swimming pool and like what the changing
room and I was just about to cover
talents in the rear and I was like my
concealer is still there but he's mad
he's mad so I'm gonna take this small
beauty rundown and it's dumb I'm gonna
press this in oh yeah this is
 waterproof as well as so good I
only put three dots on the rise and then
just rented it in with my finger I do
that sometimes but I just don't know
where any makeup I still when I like
look a bit awake I really think I was
supposed to be in this country
honestly I don't like tea or coffee and
also I don't know Westerner
okay so let's stick my lashes on before
I forget it because you guys know I will
forget okay so I'm gonna set my under
eyes I'm going to use my Mac Patrick
style powder I love this taking this
little beauty blender so I'm going to
bronze up my face I'm gonna use a
concealer eyes I'm going to use the
flawless fusion concealer from Laura
Mercier in the shade 6w I'm just gonna
put a little bit of this around the
outer parts of my face
and then I'm going to use my big boot
right up
one thing I hate is driving in the rain
and I've got a drive two hours drive and
I'm not excited about that I'm so close
to 500,000 subscribers what the
what the you saying that out loud
it's just the way this thing that when
you say out loud you're like wait five
hundred thousand like what four ninety
nine five two two I'm just so excited
I'm so glad you got a lot of my videos
it's the scariest thing when you first
start to DVD videos because you're just
like oh my god what if nobody likes me
your joy means so I'm just so grateful
okay you'll be pleased to know I'm not
actually gonna use my mac mineralize
skinfinish today I know what the
it's a more feet set with these new
brunt or they're bronzer and contour
pans so you get a bronzer on one side
and a contour shade on the other which
is quite cool and the bronzers are
shimmer so I'm just gonna use the
contour side which is that side and
share the bronze oh she's shimmer and I
don't realize with shimmer bronzer so
I'm gonna go for this one I think this
is the best shade for me this is in the
shade bloggers videos plus blogger says
their friend of me oh they have really
cute nose what's this one fantabulous
fantastic plus fabulous oh my god
they're really cute names I didn't even
take nice with the names earlier yeah
I'm gonna take the vlog or pan and I'm
gonna take this matte shade on my NYX 21
a big fluffy brush that's a no pigment
and I'm gonna apply this on top of that
cream wow this is very pigmented I don't
think I needed that much okay you let
your only need a tiny bit on your brush
okay yeah litter you only need to just
literally lightly tap your brush in even
that's a little bit too much so I'm
gonna use one of the lighter ones to
contour my nose
celebutant I'm gonna yes I'm gonna use
this shade to contour my nose so I'm
gonna pick up some of this on this brush
from iconic London just on the side of
this brush and I'm gonna bring it right
up and right up into the brow down the
front of my nose on this side I'm just
taking my Laura Mercier concealer shade
2ws it's one shade lighter so I want to
highlight down the front of my nose
then we take this little sponge press
that in then I'm just gonna go over them
with the sponge really light you just
press over that and I did just take this
and draw a little line across here just
give me more of that button top of nose
I'm gonna do my under eye so I'm gonna
go for that orange there and this brush
yeah at the moment this looks quite
daytime girl but I'm gonna turn it to
night time real quick real
quick okay then I'm gonna take this
brush and always hit that red dark color
there but I'm gonna mix in the other
shade which is there so like a bit of
that one and a bit of the dark one as
well I'm gonna keep this color closer to
my lash line I'm gonna go back to this
brush okay so we're going to turn this
into more of an evening glam look so
we're gonna do is smoke up that eyelash
line so I'm going to take my lasting
drama gel liner from Maybelline and I'm
gonna put some of this in my waterline
but I'm gonna break it slightly down as
well so I'm gonna bring it slightly
below the Worland on the lash line then
I'm gonna go to this brush and I'm gonna
blend over it that's how we've gone from
day tonight they tonight day tonight you
can leave it like that fresh in there
you can just put some bottom mascara on
and that could be a daytime look and
then if it works a little bit more sexy
a bit more smoky and even
then you got to smoke out your bottom
lash line that is something that I do
all the time if I'm like in a rush to
get ready and a bruise on my day makeup
I will just quickly smoke out the bottom
line I add a bit of dark brown and not
only my nighttime books so that's just a
tip we will so I'm going to do the same
on this side
next we're gonna do bottom mascara so
I'm gonna take my bad girl bang mascara
again
benefit this is so good for bottom
lashes it makes my bottom lashes look so
long okay we'll see my iconic London
illuminated drops I'm gonna put some on
the back of my hand and I'm gonna apply
these with my finger I'm gonna do the
same on this side with my highlights to
press it in so I'm gonna spray my morphe
m5a1 brush of some six class from Mac
and I'm gonna use my time Reesie
highlight from Anasazi are the drops
okay so we're gonna do lips next okay so
I'm gonna go with my NYX a suede lip
liner in the shade early on which is one
of their new colors
and then I'm going to take my NYX
lingerie liquid lipstick and there's a
dusk-to-dawn I look so so joy lately
like lip balms I exfoliate they're just
pure as hell okay you know what I'm
