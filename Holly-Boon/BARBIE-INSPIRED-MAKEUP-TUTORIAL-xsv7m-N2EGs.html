for once I'm gonna actually do my
eyebrows on camera because I thought I
never do a nose if you ask me to say
that's what I'm going to be doing so for
my eyebrows like always use this and
it's the dip brow pomade by anastasia
beverly hills in ash brown and i'm just
going to use my winged liner brush by
zoeva
that is high snatch my eyebrow so why
don't you the other one of camera
because it would just be so much quicker
so I did my eyebrow come and what
surprised it's not so much cool but what
can we do
eyebrows are sisters not twins so next
I'm just going to carve out my eyebrow
I'm going to use the soft ochre Paint
Pot by Mac and my Anastasia Beverly
Hills concealer brush this is number 18
the can we just can we just ignore this
okay this is not okay I was gonna film
yesterday it's gonna film this book
yesterday and I woke up with this bar
and I was like oh no says I I know I'm
just like wait and film tomorrow and
hopefully I'll be gone by then is it
gone is it no is it fun it's still there
still chillin on the side of my cheek so
I'm gonna be using my makeup geek
eyeshadows I recently purchased some new
ones so I'm gonna be using them so first
off my transition color I'm gonna take
this light pink shade here which is
called sorbet
I'm just gonna use that for my
transition role I can just say just
repeat myself
so many people ask me like why do you do
I make up bars
it's just so much easier because then
you get no fallout well obviously you
get pulled up and then you ruin your
face makeup and all so that you don't
have to be as neat because you're gonna
clean up the edges so you don't actually
have to be really neat which is just so
much easier
I honestly so that is literally why so
I'm gonna go with shades I think this is
called poppy which is like there's right
time but it comes up quite pink on my
eyes especially when I mix these here
together yeah Justin's called poppy so
I'm just gonna take some of that on my
Luck's fatigue crease brush and just
apply that actually in the crease
okay so for all over the lid I'm gonna
go in with move oh I'm so I'm first of
all going to apply the icons II gotta
agree to my lid and the glitter that I'm
using is it's called confetti it's from
eye candy again I really really loved
their glitters and I heard there are
IMAX next week so I'll make sure you
going to buy so much better yeah then
I'm just gonna apply the glitter
so for liner as always I'm going to use
the maybelline lasting gel liner
absolutely this my favorite eyeliner of
all time
or Fred lawyers and disciplines
everything
so now I'm going to apply some mascara
and am using the mad lash black mascara
by the bottom and then for fake lashes
and we're going to be using the Hugh de
Beauty lashes and these are Lana's
they're number 10 and the Ashly that I'm
going to use is the eyelash adhesive
from Tamiya lashes I've been using this
one lately and it's so much better like
ridiculously better than the other one
that I was using so
okay it's a while stay dry I'm gonna
move on to my face
if I always do but get it
everywhere and when he needs to primers
today I'm gonna use the Smashbox and
primer water first of all and then I'm
also going to use the Becca backlight
priming filter I'm just gonna apply some
of this as well okay so for foundation
I'm going to use the Marc Jacobs
remarkable I'm actually not going to mix
it with the backlight so cuz I'm just
applying my skin anyway so I'm just
gonna lie this foundation
sorry for cathedra I'm gonna use the
Maybelline fit me as a one is me
don't mess up my under eye we have the
norm I say transmitted a sin same power
machinist at my whole entire face it is
obviously I'm going to use Mac give me
son because I'm obsessed and it's anyone
that I ever use I'm going to take my mr.
right brush by two-faced
I'm going to use the potato blew by hot
mass care if you've not got this and
you've got the anastasia beverly hills
one this bunny is pretty much exactly
the same in my opinion the quality of
the product is exactly the same and it's
a lot cheaper so if you have the other
things in one and say you're running out
and you want to try something new or you
want to try again that's cheaper then
definitely get this I'm not supposed to
buy them Eva I feel like whenever like
you praise a product everyone thinks
it's because you've been paid to do so
and it's not the case that's all I would
never ever talk about anything I didn't
like because I my reputation means more
to me the money and if I didn't I could
pull out then I went over by it you say
I'm sayin
anyway I'm taking my maxi free 9 brush
and I was taking that shade always gonna
find under my ID
so for my waterline I'm gonna use the
macro mine obviously I love them I had
this now for about a year and obviously
look there's so much product in here and
as well it's the only thing that ever
stays in my waterline all day like it
won't move
he stays why it doesn't rather doesn't
go anywhere if you're looking for a
really really really good white line I
can't recommend this one enough and then
the issue arose you guys take my winged
liner brush and it should just apply it
to my waterline and it stays all day
so the Kiko eyeshadow in 208 looks like
this is 8 pounds and it's one of my
favorite eyeliners I've not had that
long and I am obsessed with these like I
saw it in the shop and I was like is
that eyeshadow it up what the hell I'm
using there's like I'm using it as a
highlight you can obviously use it as an
eyeshadow but I am obsessed
it's so nice
maybe won't you come my so I believe
somebody is the dose of colors bare with
me
I'm just gonna take this and this is
actually lit voltage I'm gonna use this
as a lip gloss obviously I don't need my
lips to be any bigger but this is
actually the only lip gloss I have it's
not sticky so I'm just gonna fight none
of this on top so that is the finished
look this is my Barbie inspired makeup
look and I was gonna apply the blonde
wig but I'm just not feeling it so I'm
just gonna leave it not there so I'm
gonna be brown Barbie but you can be
blonde Barbie you gonna be redhead
Barbie you can be whatever Bobby you
want but yeah I hope you guys enjoyed
