which shade this shade first of all and
would advise in the crease and I'm going
to put it outwards as well so I'm going
to cut the cream just above the crease
I'm really going to pull that product
out here I also got pink nails too much

pink lip then I want to get when to get
my nails and I was like oh yeah pink I'm
just going to get paint on all much in
next I'm going to take this bright pink
shade on my Sigma e25 brush I'm going to
place just in the crease and then put it
out again just literally in that crease
and put it outwards and then taking one
it's fluffy brush I'm awfully m5o for
with the product the shade that I used
before and then globe lot okay so next
I'm going to take my Maybelline the
eraser I perfect and cover concealer and
I'm going to take my Sigma cream color
b---fifty a brush I'm going to carve out
my crease
so I'm just going to set that with my
translucent powder when you're miss DNA
so funny memorize this thing about hey I
don't know why we do that so I'm going
to take my jacket here multi-planet and
we'll take this squirrel chatter it's
like a really light pink I'm going to
apply that basically just over whereby
that concealer just to give a little bit
sheesh it'll be used to look with
shimmer
I've actually nearly run out of Miami
miss Mario Badescu spray and people tell
me that socks I'm happy for you in about
that so I'm just going to spray my brush
sweat a little bit I didn't do this on
the other side but I think it's going to
make it more pigmented I'm just using my
mac 242 brush oh mama I just shown and
running looking dapper looking dapper
anyway
okay I'm going to use this liquid
lipstick by lip land
I don't know what shade this is it
doesn't say on the bottom or anything
make sure Sakura pink obviously he's
 idiot I'm going to use it for my
winged liner so I'm just going to put
some on the back of my hand
and then using my Sigma zero six winged
liner brush cut my liner cut my liner
cut it how you need to kuru
anyway I've got hair dye on my hair by
the way okay don't judge me I just
whenever I dye my hair I just get it
everywhere but it's all here you can see
it sort of my ear it's a hot mess I've
very trust anyone right here touch my
hair my sister sometimes dies and ask me
I do you sell on dialer I don't use like
box size or anything you're going to say
I'm getting like the proper stuff ain't
nobody got time for a box die ain't
nobody got time for knives they're
peroxide
no just now so was I because I took my
bond in extension that I've just got a
clip-on place out at the moment so I'm
getting my hair redone tomorrow I'll get
my laundry done tomorrow and but I
actually love getting bonded extensions
I love having the best of both worlds
and I've been able to have like really
short hair whenever I want and then
being able to just have my own hair so I
I think I want to have my long hair back
honestly but I'm going to have that for
a few months and I'm like a right short
hair again when you get some more
towards winter dunno how I'm talking
last doing this I'm definitely gonna
 it up and your reminder to match is
literally the biggest pain in my arse
hole I can't be asked
I just have two eyes seriously why what
is the need for this please why can't we
just have one ironmen of our face and
then women are will be a piece of piss
because you will have to match them
that's not symmetrical yes why am i can
go suck a do it sure what I liked my
short nail was but I just didn't feel
like me with them you know I just got
basic will have my nails like this I
just feel like I can literally snatch a
bit so I can suction Mitch take it I
just feel like I could take into the
world and I've got my nails done much
not short on Aubrey I'm short nails next
week I'm the most indecisive person in
the whole entire world I change our mind
all the time literally all the time it's
really very nice or a problem the
struggle is real and when you use my Mac
extended playing scar I'm just going to
pile it with this first before I apply
my lashes this mascara is amazing for
bottom lashes you know really like drop
an iron out I tweeted this little while
ago because it's like later you know we
like you drop an eyelash or you just
misplace an eyelash for two seconds and
then it's gone forever it's like an
Peter Pan come in the window store your
eyelash and then you've gone it's gone
forever I've still it's you've gone gone
can't find it and then you'll find it
two years later probably suck in your
hair some where the house has work
on I'm going to ages
I'll wait I can't find it so we have to
take the last one from a different pack
so I'm using what waste good job I have
another pack can you imagine I lose my
head right now so I leave my Koko lashes
in this style and more you know when you
snatched your ponytail so tight God let
you give yourself a headache that you
actually give yourself a headache that's
me right now all right I'm going to
finish off my under-eye was might lash
dry for a little bit I'm going to apply
some of the Maybelline age rewind
concealer just a tiny bit for now we're
just using this to do well under a lens
that end with my Sigma 3 under even the
sponge of the pink in this video this
video is just all pink love it and then
I'm going to take some my Laura Mercier
translucent powder and apply that
underneath my eyes I'm going to take my
morphe M 504 brush I'm going to take
that first shade that I use there I'm
gonna blend this underneath my Peter
Pan's and better fly back
in my room and give me back my eyelash
because ain't nobody got time for that
thank you
I should have quite expensive and I need
the eyelash back and then I'm going to
take that bright pink shade from the
brush pilot this show here on my Sigma
e25 brush apply that close to the lash
line and above it with like morphe m5
overall then I'm going to take some of
this liquid lipstick color that I use
for my wing I'm going to put a tiny bit
on the back of my hand again and then
I'm going to apply this close to the
lash line not in the war line closer
that's right I'm going to kind of just
like brush it blend it in with this
brush as well then I'm going to take my
Inglot gel liner in the number 76 which
is right I'm going to apply this in my
waterline using the same brush wind on
ESXi just wipe the paint off and we want
okay I'm just going to take this last
run before actually dryers so now I'm
just going to apply some mascara to my
bottom lashes okay so now I'm going to
start on where face so the first thing
I'm going to do is I'm going to take my
benefit professional and I'm going to
apply some of this just going to center
of my face to minimize my pores
oh my god so we had that society oil and
I really liked it I beneath I was using
it like constantly I love dollar over so
much and then I must have not put it on
properly and it fell oh but I need to
sleep everywhere and one of my makeup
drawers so I'm really even about that
analogy with everything and so I'm going
to spray some of the Mario Badescu
facial spray of a Loki comma and green
tea oh it's just super hydrated so life
is amazing now I'm going to use my Too
Faced Born Free foundation in the shade
golden and then I'm going to apply this
using my Sigma 3d blender lovely I can't
wait to this praise house it's literally
hurting my head so bad oh my god I think
I've been bitten on my head I don't
think it's a spot about actually it's a
bite because it's here I just in my hand
is so big and it lets you hurt so bad
when I touch it and it's so not like a
normal spot like a highest place for my
concealer I'm going to read in the
maybelline the eraser I perfect and
cover concealer this is literally my
favorite at the moment I love this so
much and it's so to you as I love away
as well like it's strokes or so it's no
expensive and it's just like slow good
so I'm going to apply this using my
Sigma cream color brush
and I'm going to bring this down the
sides of my nose but normal so much like
a reverse contour you highlight the size
of you know it will make your own
personal about having two or five
contour I'm using this shade nude by the
way nice concealer then even use my 3d
blend around it like always my favorite
sponge ever then using different sponge
I'm going to use my Laura Mercier
translucent powder and I'm going to set
that concealer in place so I was going
to bite down the size of my nose I like
to do this because it makes my nose open
up so I'm going to take my iconic London
pigment stick in the shade 4.1 to warm
up my face you know me I always do this
and then I'm first going to take my Mac
loose like a small stipple brush I don't
actually know what number this is
because rubbed off but just going to use
this to blend out the edges first of all
and then go over it with my sponge three
year and up to make sure isn't blended
in I let you can't go over this hair dry
on where it looks a hot mess
okay then taking my Mac mineralize
skinfinish in the shade deep dark I'm
going to just suppress some of this on
top of the cream where applied the cream
what the hell varnish on it change
Brooks can use this brush inside just
going to press this on top of the cream
next for my blush and wet benefit
California and whether it is small or
contour brush from Sigma
so I've got a sense the Anasazi Beverly
Hills new liquid glow in PR which I'm so
happy about it I'm so grateful I cannot
wait to try these liquid goes up my
favorite thing so I think I'm going to
use the shade peach v I do swatch these
on my snapchat again nuns nap chat if
you want me to do a video just all about
these highlighters and let me know but I
really want to try this one in this
video this is in the shade peach glow
I'll give you a twist watching my hand
show the color of it I'm going to apply
this I would normally apply my
illuminated drop so on the back of my
hand and then on my sponge oh this
is so nice
oh I knew they would be that when I put
them on my hand I was like oh oh my
god they're so nice I love a liquid glow
as you guys know I love this iconic
London illuminated drops and this is
gorgeous I thought this is so nice this
is in the shade peach fizz I can't go to
this is so gorgeous
and the start of every nose really came
through with these novena it is so good
a very similar obviously to the iconic
under luminaire drops like very similar
this was just a bit more than like a
thick of consistency the products like a
bit more stickier and not as runny but I
love these so much wrong of I love lava
so the dust is powered off memories okay
so from my lip color I'm going to use my
NYX suede lip liner in the shade soft
spoken
that I'm going to take the NYX lingerie
liquid lipstick in the shade
self-indulgent I'm going to place into
the center of my lips and then I'm
taking this lip liner over it it's just
so dry what the hell is going on and
then I'm going to use the NYX butter
gloss in the shade tiramisu and then
lastly to get rid of any excess powder
I'm going to use my Mario Badescu facial
spray with aloe cucumber and green tea
then we go that is the finished look I
