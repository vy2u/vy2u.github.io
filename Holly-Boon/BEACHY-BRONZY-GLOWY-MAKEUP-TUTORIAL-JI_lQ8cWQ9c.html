well it goes like a more of a messy a
little bit more of a natural brow not so
defined and just purely because we go
with that beachy vibe and I just prefer
my eyebrows to look a little bit more
natural so I'm just taking the anasazi
of every years this is a brow gel I'm
just going to brush this through the
hairs quickly I'm just brushing them
upwards not completely like up straight
walking upside this way then I'm going
to take my precisely my brown pants of
my benefit this is in the shade number
five hell I'd you wanna fire cuz you
 piece of camera so my
car gets going out of focus because it's
just a dick and see I'm just going to
create little brush strokes throughout
the sparse areas and lips you just make
it a little strokes I do a little bit at
a time and then I kind of build it up
too high one ear yeah just start off and
then I always hit this other end this
foodie end and just brush it for this
make sure you don't getting I can build
off a product because then it can look
too harsh actually just create little
brush strokes and then brush it through
the reason why I do the brow gel fast
and afterwards is because when I do it
first it kind of helps to keep them in
place laughs I'm trying to fill it in
it helps me out so that's why I do it
both before and after after just to keep
the obviously in place where I've set
them set the hairs where one okay so
they'll at the front of my brow that's
all just going to underline it really
really lightly and I just create little
stripes of hairs again really lightly in
the sparse areas just to thicken it up
so it looks fuller I don't really look
too much you don't like proper draw it
on you actually just want to make the
little
X so it's like it was so it's how I get
more of a a messy natural looking brow
and then I'm just going to go over it
with some of the brow gel from under
stars of Beverly Hills again just to
make sure this has set in place and
they're not going to move okay so so
little bit too thick under here applied
it a little bit too low so what I do is
can see you like as I just neaten it up
so when it takes on one Dazs radiant
creamy concealer since shade custard and
I'm first of all going to apply this
just underneath the brow I first I get
to the brow valve ruining it basically
first of all and then I like to take my
cigarette live effector brush this is
the e 68 this brush is really good for
carving up the brow because it's really
a it's like angled and I find it really
easy to use so I'm just gonna carve out
I'm going to bring it down onto the lid
I'm just going to act as Y shadow base
I'm just going to slip my lid using my
Laura Mercier translucent powder and I'm
going to take my Sigma bake precision
brush to apply this powder so now I'm
going to start on my face so first of
all to moisturize I'm going to take my
Charlotte Tilbury magic cream
I'm going to try this product from pure
cosmetics and it's the no fill of blurry
photography primer and I've never tried
this before so I'm really excited to try
it it says that you can apply it over
moisturized skin prior to makeup
application or you can be added into a
foundation and also you can layer it
under under powder highlights for a more
intense highlight basically so it's a
shape while before use
comes in this little bottle like this
I'm just going to place them to the back
of my hand first of all we should have
applied this in my t-zone time very oily
my t-zone but oops
then for eye cream we're going to take
the ginseng refreshing eye cream so
before I apply my foundation I actually
going to power up my chin area is I'm
going to put on my chin and my t-zone
because I get very oily I produce a lot
of oil in that area this sign here and
my makeup application just doesn't stay
on all day in those areas so I'm going
to take some powder on my Sigma bake
precision and first I'm going to apply
some to my chin this won't affect your
foundation by the way a lot of people
are like you can't apply creams over
powders but in this case you can and say
yeah that's my chin
and then my forehead very oily there
throughout the day my makeup runs off
also if you feel like your makeup comes
off on your nose then do this on your
nose sometimes my makeup comes off the
end of my nose and then also if you have
quite large pores it's good to do this
as well because it minimizes your pores
so supply some there as well for my
foundation you know what I'm going to
say I'm going to use the infallible
total cover in shade amber and I'm going
to mix it with my true much again I
don't know what shaved my true much is
I'm really sorry I just lost the lid and
it just doesn't have the shade on it
anyways so I think it's like seven
something W but I'm not sure my focus is
mainly in my t-zone area because it is
very mattify in its like a matte finish
so high most of it there but also got a
little bit of virus as well taking my
L'Oreal True Match on my Sigma 3d render
I'm going to use this to apply this
foundation on top you just zoom in a bit
for like really far away
that's bad it has a million miles away
who's written to Drake's new tracks if
you have Wasser favorite write it down
below I don't think I have a favorite I
do like get it together since we called
what's called I saw a lot of American
people up about gigs and Skepta
being on Drake's tracks
I think like I saw a lot of people
saying like they're not um are UK hip
hop artists the craft is off and I'm
like but they're not hip hop is they
grind why yes that's why I don't think
they get it
I don't think Americans understand
they're not hip pop their grime you
don't mean it
for concealer I think I'm going to use
the top shape tape
because I love this stuff and then I'm
going to bend that even why 3d blender
huh I mean this look is if you want to
be extra spark on the beach if you want
to look snatch to the gods because
sometimes I mean artist it should put
fit broadens want to put sunglasses on
janata me I don't always wear full be to
the beach but I mean this is if you want
to be extra as well if you go into IB
phone you're going to these parties or
if you're going my BAE are so fat that
in the summer this is like good to do it
will laughs this makeup will last all
day I'll show you how to make sure it
lasts all day if you only like me make
sure you put powder on her neck like why
I did because that makes the world of
different it will stop with fun Easter
coming up in certain areas for out the
day and you will stop getting oil
patches I mean you might still get a bit
of oil produce a bit of oil a bit shiny
but you can take like your powder out of
you so you can just powder those areas
okay so I'm going to set my under eye
with my Laura Mercier translucent powder
and this 3d render then just stop up and
crease in also I'm just going to bring
it down slightly X it minimizes the
pores just going to apply a little bit
more on the forehead where I get very
Whaley throughout day especially in the
summer very idea before has a match in
okay for cream bronze on visit my soul a
tan - Chanel bronzer and I'm going to
take this on my mini stipple brush from
Mac I'm just going to slow my brush in
this this stuff is really good i use
this when I'm really tired like we're
not going to get rate and and my
foundation is a foundation and doesn't
match I tend to just use it above this
on my skin instead of a foundation
so I'm not actually going to contour but
I'm going to use this to bronze up a
little bit tiny bit more and just kind
of set wherever applied that cream so
I'm just going to take this big fluffy
brush I'm not sure what brush this is
from I think it's been funny planning
I'm not sure can't remember it's really
good and I'm going to take this contour
shade and I'm going to use this just
dust it over where I applied that cream
just want that really bronze goddess
vibes you know

to take summer from the Sun dipped glow
kit from Anasazi Beverly Hills so if
you've got nice long luscious lashes I'm
very jealous because you can just put
Bibble scar on and your eye makeups done

so I'm just going to apply some mascara
for my lashes I'm going to use the

do I love them I'm going to take my Sun
dipped glow kit by Aussie Beverly Hills
I'm going to hit the change someone
which is the one that used on my brow
bone my Sigma high cheekbone highlight
brush is the fo3
to spray it with some fix glass first of

because that's what bitch as though okay
that's why you need those drops in July
because look at that I see you need a
zit on your met drops hot deal so good
