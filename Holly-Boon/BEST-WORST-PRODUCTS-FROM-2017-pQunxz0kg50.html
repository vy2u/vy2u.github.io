youtube channel my name is holly boon if
you're new here hello welcome hi so
today I thought I would fill my
favorites products of 2017 and then I
was going for my makeup and I found some
stuff that I read it like in 2017 as
well so I thought I'd throw that in as
well and there I have a lot of stuff I
know it so I'm gonna do this in the most
random order I feel like maybe I should
start with stuff that I didn't like
first and then end on a good note
you know I mean start at the bad end
with good yes okay so one of the first
things from 2017 that I don't really
like and not even though I didn't really
like it I just find it a bit like me do
you not I mean
I didn't love it I didn't pay it
yeah it's the hue to be a 3d highlight
palette so yeah it's the highlight
palette from Uwe I I don't know I just
feel like it's not the highlights nice
but it's not
BAM wham bam Bam's you know I
mean it's just a bit like me I just felt
there's so many better highlight
palettes out there
I mean anasazi Beverly Hills highlight
salutes you one of my favorites
it's the second thing I mean you
probably sick of hearing about this but
it's the stars of every Hill subculture
palette um yeah I feel like we've all
just been through this we've heard a
thousand million times it's getting a
bit boring but yeah I just didn't work
out the ocean as a talkie the colors I
mean I do like the colors but and it's
hard to get things to burn together in
this palette because of the texture of
the shadow it's very chalky and just you
get hella fallout and it's just
impossible to blend but I think that's
just down sighting happened in their lab
or something but yeah I think they sort
out now but anyway you're pretty sick of
hearing about this but that just didn't
work out for me okay
another thing from anasazi Beverly Hills
this again it's a bit like me it's not
really I don't hate it I don't love it
just probably won't buy it again you
know and that's the liquid globe I I
just find it too sticky that's the
problem I find it really sticky I don't
find it that intense where is like my
iconic London illuminated drops I live
for them they're like not sticky at all
and they're just very very very bright
which is what I like and so yeah these
again we're just a little bit like a but
again I don't hate them I don't love
them I won't buy them again you know
okay next I read are these this is the
Urban Decay vice special effects these
are like a lip topper and they're like
really really really glittery I mean if
you like a glittery lip then you will
like these but also I just don't like
the application of this I just find it
really weird like it's really thin it's
really hard to control um it just
doesn't apply the nicest it there just
hey I don't like them I started I kind
of did like this and I didn't like it
and I did like it doesn't liking it and
it's a Too Faced Born This Way setting
powder I did like it
for a long time and then I don't know
what it is I think it just works good
with some foundations and some
concealers but then it doesn't work as
well with other concealers and
foundations I just I don't know I
haven't figured it out yet I need to
find out why this works sometimes and
doesn't and I will figure it out but
yeah I just feel like when I apply it
sometimes I go to dust it off on a bike
with this it leaves the cut the white
cast and I can't get it off there look
really really ashy so I yeah I just
struggle to work with this sometimes but
it's good if you want to set just a tiny
bit it works really well but just I
wouldn't advise this for bacon at all
but yeah like I said I go I don't know
about this you know I don't know I need
to figure it out and use again okay next
is the Too Faced melted latex high shine
lipstick I do like some of these latex
lipsticks I do like them and some of the
trades are just so gorgeous and then
really lovely but this one I just think
in it I just don't get it it's a unicorn
tears
and I just don't see the point in it to
be honest I just don't think many people
are gonna want to wear like a
holographic purpl glass you know I mean
some people might but I'm I'm guessing
most people don't
yeah so I just I just don't get the
point in it civilians such a stir don't
understand it but the formula is really
nice but it's just yeah try the other
ones the other ones re nice I just think
the unicorn you know can we just
leave that in 2017 and just stop with
that
I feel like everyone tries to the
unicorn stuff and I just don't get it I
don't understand don't get it okay next
is the urban decay troublemaker mascara
this is supposed to be sex proof and let
me tell you it's not an object I didn't
try it but it I mean it's supposed to be
sex proof but I apply it and then you
know and you get like where it runs a
little bit and you get it like a bit of
black under your eye that always happens
with this mascara and I'm just confused
because it's the place to be sex proof
so if you have sex with this one you're
pretty gonna end up if it all down your
face so I don't really get that you know
I mean maybe I got a forty one I just I
don't know okay next thing this is like
a love-hate this is I I love it and I at
the same time this is a funny throw for
a foundation in the shade 300 I
love this foundation the formula just
the way it applies on my Twitter skin
and it stays set all day and it is
excised and if I graphs amazing it's
just such a gorgeous foundation the only
problem is it breaks me out and it does
break me out and I kept using it it's
like literally you guys will know
I use this every time I want to Emma
wake up so pretty much four or five
times a week I would wear this and every
single time looks amazing no matter what
I wear underneath it always looks so so
nice and and then I kept breaking out
and I thought it's because I was taking
biotin and stuff so I stopped the biotin
I still kept breaking out I was like
what is going on
and then my friend was like oh you used
the Fenty foundation like what shade
should I get she shoots so she then
brought the foundation then I saw him
and she was like I've got spoil so I
never get spots here in here like it's
really weird and I was like oh my god
like I think it's what's there as well
and then I don't know why and it's
definitely from this foundation because
I spoke to other people and they've had
the same problem so I don't know what it
is about this foundation the breaks you
out I mean I thoroughly cleanse my skin
every single day so it must just be
something in the foundation that makes
me break out but I love it so much it's
such a good foundation of having that
Fanny please can you just fix that
situation because this foundation was
gonna be my holy grail like it was just
the best
so the next thing again I'm just a
little bit like about is this Too Faced
highlight I love to face like I love the
chocolate palettes I love so much from
Too Faced don't get me wrong like I love
the liquid lipstick for me I think it's
one of the best but I think I what is
this like it's just like I even know I
just don't get it it's a highlight but
it's like purpley pinky silvery I just
think in it okay so we're gonna move on
to things I actually like and there
wasn't much that I didn't really like
this year and again it's not that I
don't really like it it's a summer just
a bit like about it I don't I don't know
you know um but yeah so I'm gonna be on
to things that I love this year cuz
they've got so much to talk about and so
I'm just gonna start random like
completely random so first thing that
I've loved this year is the Too Faced
Born This Way Foundation
I used to trade moon sand I have used
this foundation a lot this year and I
love it especially in summer time cuz I
don't feel like um you know on a hot day
it feels comfortable on the skin and it
just yeah it's it's really well on my
skin anywhere I've got oily to
combination skin and it wishes works
pretty well for me I like to mix my
illuminator drops in from I got it got
in with it as writing as Miri glowy dewy
skin um so yeah the Born This Way
Foundation from Too Faced has been one
of my favorites and then yeah the iconic
guns in Tulum
it drops these this was in the shade
glue which is the darkest shade I do
make these ones in with moisturizer and
apply it on my body in the summer and
then I use the original shade for my
face and I love it it's like this is
definitely got to be my top highlight of
the year because it's just yeah
everything if you've not tried it it's
so good I've tried other brands that do
the same sort of similar formula and I
just don't think this is good I don't
think this is intense this one's not
sticky I don't know I just I love this
so if you haven't tried the illuminator
drops from iconic London then I
definitely recommend them especially for
summer I live in it in summer I just put
it all over my body and it's just yeah
everything so the next thing this is my
concealer of the year some of these
products didn't come out in 2017 but
this is stuff that I have loved so much
2017 so just so we don't get mixed up
because this didn't come and in 2017 but
I've been obsessed a bit this year and
it's mainly in the eraser I perfect a
cover concealer in the shade nude I also
like to use the shade light and I do get
freely stuff very really quick but it is
very really really inexpensive so don't
remind and but I like the nude for under
my eyes because I don't mind a right to
be too bright sometimes and I use the
shade light on my lids as my face I
didn't Eve my eyeshadow and it works
really well but yeah this is my favorite
concealer this year I love it so much
it's so good as they just need more
shades in that like Maybelline you need
more shades in that you need to cater
for everyone because that because he
knows so good so next I want to talk
about the Urban Decay all nighter
setting spray this stuff is everything
it'll keep your makeup on all day all
night all month all year all your whole
life like this is so good it's just
amazing I love you so much and I do want
to get the one that Scott will control
there is one so I want to try that one
because I am a little bit oily I still
have to kind of powder a little bit
sometimes and where I get a little bit
oily but this does keep my makeup on
right it's insane who needs to try it
okay so next is the beauty bakery
translucent powder
I have raved about this product so much
and Jackie I know uses in her videos and
I already had it but then I hadn't tried
it and I was like why am I try though I
already have it
so Jackie and I shouted to her I love
her she was raving about and I was like
I trust open you so much I was saying I
was like I want to try it I love it it's
literally the best the best powder ever
honestly you get a zero flashback it
sets your makeups so nice and it just
really smooths out the under eye like I
can't even explain I've used a lot of
firm translucent powders before or just
like setting powders and they don't tend
to smooth they set but they don't really
smooth that much this one smooth my skin
so much and if you haven't tried this I
really do recommend getting it I think
it's about 20 pounds off cop movie or
beautybay and I will link all these
products below anyway but Beauty bakery
powder is everything okay so next is the
Stila magnificent metals glitter and
glow liquid eye shadow I love these so
much I've you see so much this year
I literally have every color of these
and they're just perfect
they're so perfect they're so sparkly
and they just apply so nice they price
so easy
I mean honestly sometimes I can't be
bothered to work with glitter I find it
really messy I love glitter but it is
messy and these ones this is not messy
and it gives you the same effect so I
love these and I really recommend
getting these these are so good okay so
next always talk about is NYX lip
products
I have loved NYX lip products this year
I haven't worn them nearly every single
time timer makeup they're just so good I
love the formula everything I love the
suede lip liners I love the butter gloss
I love them soft matte lip creams I love
the lingerie liquid lipsticks I love
everything lip from NYX I'm obsessed and
see yeah that's been my top top top top
top top top lip products this year has
just been NYX just purely nixed if you
use matte lip liners I highly recommend
trying the NYX wait behind this because
they're literally exactly the same and
so much cheaper so if you've been using
matte lip rice you play just though you
pay dresser
congratulations you plays yourself you
could have got NYX for way cheaper but
yeah
lingerie liquid lipsticks the butter
gloss the soft matte lip cream this way
lip liners is everything
NYX lips is just an obsessed another lip
product I have loved this year is the
over the top
lipgloss from their designated
collection of dose of colors I love
those disguise lip products as well I
love their liquid lipsticks especially
the one is super natural and knock on
wood those two I don't have them on me
now because I think they're in my clutch
bag which is downstairs because I take
them out of me all the time it's like my
favorite lip color like my favorite nude
and so yeah knock on wood and
supernatural from those the colors the
best nudes if you like a peachy brownie
nude you'll love them and this glass is
just everything like there's Ian Kate
you did so well with this class I love
it so much I like to wear this sometimes
just on its own and it's just so nice
it's just like a gorgeous glass with
like little flecks of gold in it and if
you can get your hands on this I don't
know how I think the collections gone
now but I mean if there's any way to get
your hands on this I would get it
because it's just so nice it's so nice
okay so for glitter this year I have
been obsessed with the NYX loose pigment
glitter and it's really really fine
glitter I find it easy to work with it's
not chunky if it was comfortable in the
eyes it's just all around very really
good and it's inexpensive yeah I just
got two new ones I've got number eight
and number ten which is a golden silver
and so yeah those have been my favorite
just like loose pigment bears because
they're just like I said really fun and
really easy to work with and my favorite
liquid glitters this year have been the
Evans again heavy metal liquid good love
that I'm obsessed I love the shades that
they have in this ever realized pinky
one and it's like a pink but it's got a
little reflects in it and it just is so
nice I need to get that and then also
from collection these glam crystals does
in jawline i think he's like two pounds
each and they have quite a few shades
now I've got like a greeny blue one this
one silver and a couple of others I
think I love them they're so good so
next is the pixie Rose oil brand which
is a nourish nourishing nourishing face
oil I love this I use the waves under my
makeup but I've been like to oily -
where's under my makeup and but in the
Sun what I really love to apply this and
then apply like a moisture like a tinted
moisturizer and a bit of bronzer I
really like to do that in the summer
because I don't know too much makeup
when it's like hot but yeah I love this
I normally probably
before bed and I leave it on overnight
and it really soaks into my skin it just
makes my skin feel unreal and I know
this an oil which has like like gold
bits and then it's Posada the fossil is
so expensive and this one is nowhere
near as expensive and each dish is good
works just the same so if you don't want
to spend the money on the for Sally one
then get this one because it's just as
good and then next we have the studio
fix powder from Mac I love this this
year I love this has set my whole face I
get the shade NC 43 which isn't isn't it
doesn't match the shade of the
foundation so like NC 43 in the
foundation this is not the same color so
you need to actually go in a store and
watch it to yourself that makes sense
because this is not the same traders in
C 43 in the foundation I have to set my
face a lot cuz I am quite willing so
after I apply my foundation I love to
just like use a face powder I do like
the translucent powder from Beauty baked
here on my face as well that gives me
such a nice finish and like really
really like smooth dark skin and but I
also love this as well so Eva I love so
for power to highlight this year it has
to be the ode for highlights this is
just one that I think that which is the
nikkietutorials ever going highlight but
I have so many of the over highlights
and I think they're actually one of the
best powder highlights just on the
market they're so pigmented they're so
bright they just blend into the skin so
nicely and they don't look like glittery
or chunky they're just so so nice so if
you haven't tried the Oprah highlights I
definitely recommend trying them they
are Bom Bom duck palm okay so next is my
iconic London pigment stick in the show
four point one I like to use this as
like a cream bronzer to warm my face it
bends up really really easy and it just
sits really nice under powders and stuff
and it always just burns in really well
so the icon it on a pigment stick for
cream bronzer I have tried this for
foundation it didn't really work that
well for me as foundation because it
would separate but that's because I was
quite oily so I might try it again
foundation to make sure that I set my
prime on top of that and see how it goes
but yeah I love this so contour kit this
year has to be my pure contour Diaries I
love this I've used this majority of the
sometimes I go back to my Anasazi
Beverly Hills one which I love as well
it blends in really nicely doesn't look
muddy it doesn't cling to certain
patches on the skin and it doesn't look
really like a she it's not the perfect
shade for me so yeah I love this contour
palette that's okay so I shadow palettes
this year I've picked out a few that I
have just literally been using
constantly and throughout the year I
mean some of these I didn't get to a
midway through the year but I just think
these have just been hands-down the best
eyeshadow parts of this year so the
first ones are the dubious place
palettes this one is the magic palette
and this one is the siharan these are
the most pigmented eyeshadows you will
ever ever ever use they are so bomb I
just love the colors and the palettes as
well like you just get so much color and
the pan size is really big the foil
shadows are so so nice and BA just
everything about these palettes I love I
love these palettes to vyas products
also they're not very expensive as well
and you get a lot of eyeshadow like I
said the pan size is really big in this
magic palette they're just perfect
eyeshadow is perfect light of the
palettes I also love the packaging I
think the packaging is so gorgeous
so I love those and also I have been
loving my Jaclyn hill palettes with
morphe this is just perfect I think it's
just got every shade in it I would ever
need and so we've got like Browns and
reds and we've got some color and stuff
and I just it's just one that I always
go to I will set off the foiled shadows
these teal blue shades have been my
favorite as well this year like he I
don't know if you saw that video that I
did with this palette when I did the
blue all over the eye and then bend it
out with some Brown and it just looks so
good so yeah the Jacqueline Hill palette
is like one of my staples
if I'm like guys who were on holiday and
I don't really take loads of eyeshadow
palettes this is kind of like the only
one that I'll take this and then a few
like single shadows but yeah Jaclyn hill
just so well that palette
vici from morphe have been my ride or
die as well the 35
om which is just all matte shades just
all warm matte shades this has been one
of my ride or dies this year not really
much to say about that other than it's
just a nice warm palette and it happens
loads of shadows and it's
then soon and then this one which is one
of the newest ones which is the 39 a
palette I'm obsessed I love this play as
well just love all the colors
you've got the Reds the Pink's the
Browns the blues the greens just
everything about this palette I love
also I love these NYX palettes and the
NYX ultimate multi finish shadow palette
I have all of them that they do I have
this one like the one that has like the
pinky shades in it and then I've got the
one that's like then what we call it one
I love that okay so also this year I
just got a new one because mine right
now I've got gone through about five or
six of these this year and this the
Mario Badescu face raspado cucumber and
green tea I don't really like the
rosewater one I prefer this cucumber one
I was inviting a little bit more
refreshing I don't know why I just do
and I love to spray this in my face any
given opportunity so I anytime
throughout the day I'll sprays on my
face if I feel like I need a little bit
of hydration it's perfect in the Sun we
could put it in the fridge and then when
you spray it on your face when it's
really hot it's nice and cold and it's
just so good and and then I got the
shower I spray this on my face I spray
it on my face before I go to bed I just
spray this all the time I love it so
much if you've not tried it try it
you're probably falling off of it it
doesn't set your makeup a lot of people
get confused with this it's not a set in
spray but it brings life to your skin
like you know you apply loads and loads
of powder if you give your face a spray
with this it just lets all the powder
soak into the skin everything starts to
look seamless and you don't look powdery
anymore you just look no more so yeah
the Mario Badescu spray I kind of
replace my mac fix+ with this because I
just prefer this one and this one's way
cheaper
okay I'm going to speak about brushes
real quick because I don't got them on
me but brush sets morphe brushes unreal
the morphe brush sets as well they know
how the UK website and the morphe brush
sets are not very expensive and the I
got the eye brush set and I use it
constantly it's such they're just such
good brushes so morphe brushes zoeva
brushes I love silver brushes I love Mac
brushes and I love Sigma brushes think
we're a Mac eye look with more
I see and then you've got the Weaver and
Morphy which are a little bit more
inexpensive so I would just go for more
feet and
zoeva I just have my Mac brushes from
years ago and also my Sigma brushes from
years ago and I love them they're just
amazing quality they've lasted me for
years but I mean if you don't have the
money then definitely you get more for
your so we've our because they're really
good yeah I think that is everything
from this year I think that's everything
I mean like I said I'm Hanoi by coughing
stray so might not be but if I remember
anything oh my god how could I forget
how could I forget
see how my favorite eyelashes did this
year a homer dog so my favorite
eyelashes this year are these Koko
lashes or more I have loved these love
these lashes through through and through
and through fall in love these lashes
over and over and over again I mean yes
yes yes if you haven't tried them you
need to try them a synthetic they're not
mink they last you so long I reuse them
over and over and over again you can get
them in the UK from false eyelashes
codit UK which I will link below and
they're just bomb so you need to try
these dashes if you haven't already I
think that is everything now like I said
I may be forgetting things because I
can't think straight but yeah if I have
forgotten anything I'll put it in the
description box because I can't think I
don't think I have but I mean I might
have if I have if I have I'll put it in
the description box yeah I hope you guys
