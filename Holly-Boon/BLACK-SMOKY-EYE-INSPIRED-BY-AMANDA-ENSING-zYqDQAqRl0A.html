shade i'm gonna be using makeup geek
eyeshadows i'm gonna use frappe and I'm
gonna be using again papaya juries my
face face efore t-take vending brush I
literally haven't done a black smokey
eye in probably like a year it just
scares me I saw a Monday ends into it
and I was just like I love her and I was
just that I really just want to try it
so yeah she inspired me to do this video
so once I look like that and I'm gonna
come in with my Sigma 3d HD precision
brush and I'm gonna apply my sick of a
gel liner on my eyelid I'm really scared
then I'm just going to take my blending
brush together I'm just gonna try to
blend out
I'm just going to take my sigma e35
blending brush and go back in with a
frappe and just maybe apply this in the
crease
it's now going in with a winged liner
I'm using the where is this Maybelline
liner Express line refined
so now I'm just going to add some
mascara before I apply false lashes and
I'm using the less lash architects 4d
mascara by L'Oreal sofa lashes I'm going
to use the sural UK long lash again I've
got your edges
okay so whilst I wait for that to drive
I'm gonna do my face makeup also these
nails are from a old car I think that's
how you say it and they're basically
Bellamy Owens know her work I think as I
said I don't know but you can get a pair
of these for under $10 and also if you
use my discount code I think you can't
like 15% off I'm not sure but I just
can't carry just hottie Boone and but I
love these like it saves you obviously
going to the nail shop might be thick
she just glue them or yourself I'm so
yeah I'm loving these so as always for
prime I'm using every new view from
empire bomb
recently I've been spraying like rose
water that just Brits and hang my face
and then it's making my skin for a lot
softer and I'm basically got like a bad
my forehead on holiday and it's all
peeling and I might explain it like
every day but it's just going more and
more like patch here stuff so yeah I've
been using this rose water stuff I walk
through and it would glaze wake up and
then I really like that
so for foundation I'm gonna use their
dual air baffling
I'm going to be using the Maybelline fit
me concealer concealer in light
so I'm really annoyed because I ordered
some makeup with Matt every time I order
next day delivery of them it never comes
next day or the day after
like I ordered it two days ago now this
happened to me before as well it's
really annoying it's like if you can't
deliver the next day you don't have an
option for it because I paid extra so
little in
okay so I'm just going to set that with
one more machine setting powder
my chin always gets so oily like so
earlier today okay so I'm just gonna
leave that to just bake for a little bit
I recently brought the hoola by benefit
so I think I'm just gonna try that to
ponder on see how it goes
okay so using my mr. right brush by
two-phase I'm just going to dust off
this powder say for blush I think I'm
gonna go for baby laughs just in the
toothpaste blush palette I go for this
one hero thing
I maybe mix the two I might mix the two
actually so I'm just going to finish
with my eyes I'm just going to apply
some mascara to my lashes okay so wait
for my waterline I'm going to be using
the Elizabeth Arden smokey eye pencil
I think I'm just gonna step that with
some black eyeshadow because it never
stays so I'm just taking the black 504
335 PE put it pretty going with frappe
and I'm gonna apply this to my bottom
lash line I reason the I showed you
brush my face face
so now I'm going to apply some mascara
to my bottom Russian
okay so now for hot I'm going to be
using the very illuminizer I'm just
going to spritz my flat fresh with a bit
of mac fix+
is the luxe highlight brush panel either
just gonna replace them up to my brow
bone okay so now for lips I'm going to
use Dolce Nikkei by Kylie lip kit by
Heidi I think I'm Andy used to candy K
but that's like a little bit too pink it
looks like really pink on me so I'm just
going to go for more of this like brown
I'm just going to spritz my face and mac
fix+ I'm running out of this is why all
did Mac for next day's delivery but it
didn't show up so this is actually like
the top I have the tiniest bitterness I
don't even know if this one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
