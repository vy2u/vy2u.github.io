hello everyone
so I'm really annoyed because I've tried
to film this video so many times and
it's fucked up every single time so
hoping this time it goes fine
my eye is room all around so here it's
not going to be a struggle to a side
product I think I've left it alone about
three hours now and it's still just as
bad I really want to film this video so
I did apply a shadow base I use the top
shape type concealer and just set that
so then I'm gonna take my diffuse crease
brush by Sigma and the morphe 35o
Emperor personally take this shade right
here for my crease see I'm really hoping
that this actually lets me apply but I
think it's what I was so sore because I
was on shoot yesterday and making six
different looks on me and my eyes were
just dead afterwards like I keep taking
off the panel and taking off beyond so I
think that's what's happened
I've had that issue I've tried I dropped
tea bags cucumber wet funnel cold ice
anything to try and short man out and
it's not it's working so I think they
just fed up with makeup at the moment
okay so next I'm going to take this
bright orange shade right here and I'm
going to apply the show in the crease
and bring it right in the crease here is
violet right in there in a corner and
the outer corner I'm not going to buy
too much product access which is really
soft and then I'm going to take my buff
and burn brush by Sigma so normally I
just leave my eyeline and try and not
film but I really really want to get a
video out for you guys so sorry this
might have a bit of a mess or water I
I'm drying up on it
okay so then next I'm going to take my
Modern Renaissance or modern
reminiscence renew since the deck knew I
was on so don't hustle don't touch me a
little music miss JD which is good love
that are so I'm believe my exact blend
brush by Sigma EJ - EJ - brush again in
the crease and then right
in a corner let me film this video and I
will leave you the fuck alone
lets me film this video who once my eye
starts waterings upset game fucking over
like I can't wear any makeup for your
client you can't let anything you have
applied for it where its warrant in to
worry to fly it's a frustrating incident
I thought seriously look at watery eyes
all the time because it's like the worst
thing ever
so he's frustrated everyone's now anyway
I'm going to take my L'Oreal super liner
I love this iron I'd actually never
tried it before in an Oreo sent me and I
like why have I never tried this but
it's actually so good and is really read
black as well and I find it really easy
to use which is always a bonus so yeah
so this problem I hear it when it is why
for that so we're just going to roll
with it
so after that my take my ash cosmetics
glitter glue and whenever I destroyed my
netbook this stuff is really not the
best thing to use if you have sensitive
eyes because it stings like fuck I just
don't have any other good agree so I'm
gonna have to use this so I'm now going
to take my certified glitter bitch for
you who colors so nice I know Ritchie
loves condo car fucking Dale
he gets good if you get greater on the
line I just try not to but if you do if
they hate you can go over it I'll show
you in a sec yeah it's going to go over
that with this liner just going to apply
some my benefit they are real mascara
real quick so I'm going to use the house
of lashes are the ikonics that is the
light ones don't mind where I and why I
know is by the way that of a hot last
because I went to now stop skipping out
and they were like sorry I can't fit you
and I was like oh my god don't tell me
that and then like I haven't had time to
get them done so I just paid them myself
and they just live a lot less so yeah
that my face I'm going to take my hands
triple moisturizer primer first of all
yeah the tree peril guys because I've
actually stopped turning for a few days
come the skin but a bit like your eye so
I kind of thought give them up to skin
and help with a break so if you want
even wonder how it's they've got a lot
that's the reason once for foundation
today I'm going to take my L'Oreal True
Match I decide to try this again after
working with L'Oreal because it is
issues of them I was like don't want to
rely on try out foundation again so here
it is I turn it over day little bit too
dark
I've got dark sakes ahead pan on so I
think I'm just gonna have to apply this
on my neck but I feel like this
foundation I mean I used I did prefer
the other one I really did prefer the
foundation before they change the
packaging because right when they change
the packaging they change the actual
products I've always thought that though
but this one's a little bit more sheer
it's not as full coverage but I feel
like you can still build it up so it's
still good drugs but still my favorite
drugstore foundation and yeah it's just
go straight in because I wish I could
get hold of the ones that are the
forming arcs I love that so much
so Granderson I'm taking my iconic
London this is a car and what this
device is called very good on us
someone needs everything with liquid
foundation to tip and it was this brush
not with creams I thought of creams it
doesn't work as well with Koreans I like
Jesus Beauty Blender but especially of
liquids this works really well three
quick as well so fucking see it I'm
gonna take my tart shape tape in light
medium which is way too light it's not
going to lie but I'm doing it again its
Oakland's distance you can make it where
I think it's too light there are always
I kind of just send it in and then I'll
take a little tiny bit of my foundation
shade a tiny bit I mean a tiny bit
normally what's left over on the boss of
the sponge and dab over the top of my
concealer
okay so those of you always ask me how
because sometimes when you apply
illuminator drops on top of powders it
goes it would take your foundation off
it will go like patchy and so this is
kind of like the tip that I sometimes do
I mean mine tend to do that but I have
had occasions where some that way of
applied too much foundation concealer
and then powder and then it's been like
taking my foundation of or it's like
just final actually so I'll show you
what I would do in that situation so I'm
going to take my artsy RCM a no color
powder and I don't not going to bake
because this tart shape so quickly that
is really really good at not creasing so
I'm really just going to apply little
tiny bit under my eyes and down here by
the winner is avoid this area here avoid
it if you could even have my highlight
less you don't tend actually tend to
need to set it okay so once you apply
the power dar just to this part here
this part is not top there's nothing
then part of that I've not like any
powder to this area here so I'm going to
take my iconic London illuminator drops
and I'm gonna top the money's on my face
so I'm just going to apply some on my
cheekbone just a little tiny bit above
my brow the other side as well
I'm going to take my little PD Bend on
my mini one and just send that in and
you should really get that problem and
then it's not taking my foundation off
and it's not going back to you so um if
you guys get that problem it's only
cheaply because you're applying too much
powder as well in that area like I'm
going to take my Chanel bonsais from
over Pisa cream and my stipple brush
from Sigma 0 slide by 850 brush I'm
going to apply this
so then scones I'm going to take my
understanding of Beverly Hills powder
contour kit and I'm going to take the
darkest shade this is a light to medium
palette okay so I'm going to go over my
highlight with the iconic under powder
shimmer palette and I'm going take the
really light shade here because I want
it to be really bright other ways you
name it I'm gonna take my Anasazi are a
two three brush
I'm going to finish off my undereyes I'm
going to hit my morphe 35o M palette
it's basically the 35o palette but just
all matte shades which I fucking love by
the way so first of all I'm going to
take this bright orange shade right here
and we'll take it on my Sigma exact
blend the e30 brush so I'm going to
apply this shade first of all just from
my lower lash line close to my lash line
as possible that poconos up in the eye
I'm going to take my Modern Renaissance
right on still don't know so I judge me
hey don't touch me and I'm going to take
shade lovely out which is this pink
shade and again a fire underneath just
underneath the orange shade just
slightly underneath and then next taking
my benefit they are room skaara
now a little bit to my top lashes so I'm
going to use a L'Oreal telescopic
mascara for my bottom lashes okay so for
my lip color I'm going to take super
natural liquid lipstick by Joseph colors
first of all
and then I'm talking about a fake that
understands your lip gloss in undress so
that is the finished look I hope you
