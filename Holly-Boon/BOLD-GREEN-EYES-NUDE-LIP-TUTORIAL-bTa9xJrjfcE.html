filming I commend Greene I look just
inspired by this top Rooney and this top
is actually from my collection with my
bandage dress which lorises launches on
Sunday at 9 p.m. so if you wouldn't get
anything from my collection you follow
me on snapchat you would have seen it
the other day then it launches Sunday at
9 so make sure you go on the website for
9 because there's like limited edition
pieces so the pieces won't be available
forever so yeah anyway let's get started
so the first thing I'm gonna do is
program I are using the soft ochre Paint
Pot by Mac and I'm going to be using
this Anastasia concealer bar
so I recently just purchased some more
makeup the after days to add to my
palettes because I felt like I needed
some color in here so these are the
trades I'm gonna be using today if they
take Peach Smoothie for my transition
color I could never say transition it
really annoys me transition transition
transition color okay so next shade I'm
gonna go in with is this like really
kind of like bluey green shade that this
mint color here and this is called it's
called sure thing so I'm gonna come in
with this shade in my crease and I'm
gonna take the exact same brush the Mac
217 brush
okay so now I'm going to go over this
shade right here just like more grainy
shade and this is called Fuji Fuji maybe
the size they are okay but yeah I'm
really back upside and again my Mac 217
brush
I go don't worry about this mess here
because because why we did I make up
first I think don't have to be really
really neat you can just clean it up
after so now I'm gonna take my Mac 239
short shader brush I'm gonna take this
white shade here which is called ice
queen I'm just gonna highlight my inner
corner okay so now I'm gonna wing my
liner and I would have using the
Maybelline gel liner and this is just a
lasting drama Carolina in black
obviously and then I'm going to take my
winged liner brush by zoeva
okay so after I'm gonna apply lashes and
first of all skin apply some mascara I'm
using the Mac extended playing mascara
as always yes if it actually said I'm
going to use the huda beauty lashes and
these are in Lana which is number 10 and
for eyelash glue I'm going to use the
salmon system natural lash strip lash
adhesive
okay so whilst my lashes are drying I'm
just gonna move on to my face
so for primer I'm going to use this
Smashbox photo finish primer water okay
so for foundation today I'm going to use
the Giorgio Armani luminous silk
foundation the reason why I purchased
this is because loads of you have asked
me if I think it's good as offer that
I've not used it in such a long time I
think the last time he uses it was
probably like two years ago I can't
actually remember whether I liked it or
not
so I repurchase said I'm going to use it
today for the first time in forever and
let you got her - I think so yeah
okay so I like the foundation at the
moment and when I have to use it a few
more times and let you guys know what I
think just because of that when you use
a foundation it's the first time you
can't really judge it you need to use a
few times first okay so if we're
concealer today I'm after you've not
using the Maybelline fit me I want to
try something new just because I've had
that they discontinued in it so I need
to find another Holy Grail or concealer
I'm going to be using the Becca ultimate
coverage concealer and this is in shade
banana just going to apply this under my
eye using my concealer brush by
anastasia beverly hills
just going to go ahead and set that use
my laura mercier translucent setting
powder
we go over the map give me some bronzer
and this is the Too Faced mr.right brush
I'm just going to warm up my face
why is my under eye looks white in this
camera but off-camera it just it's
normal so it's clean so I'm actually
going to take the chocolate Soleil at
bronze up by Too Faced and just this duo
fiber brush by first face Brillion okay
so I'm going to take my Mac the two
three nine short shader brush and I'm
gonna take this shade right here I'm
just gonna apply that to my under-eye
okay I'm gonna go in with this great
idea which is called a few G I think and
same brush
okay so now for highlight I'm going to
actually use the Becca shimmering skin
perfecter and this is in moonstone and
I'm going to take my Sigma tapered
highlight brush
so for my lip color I'm going to go for
Mac stripped-down lip liner and the Too
Faced chocolate honey lipstick
so this is a finished look I hope you
