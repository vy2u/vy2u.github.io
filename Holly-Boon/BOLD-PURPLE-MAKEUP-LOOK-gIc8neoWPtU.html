more pepper tea
smokey eye not like really purple just
like resold light purple and then I'm
gonna do a really bold lip you'll also
be able to see like a nude lip with this
sometimes always with a nude lip or a
bold lip depends what you fancy but yeah
so first of all to prime as always I'm
gonna be using the Nivea for men post
shave balm those of you asked me if I
can just show the products in the videos
so I'm really sorry I haven't been doing
that I'm gonna start doing it now so
yeah this is what I'm gonna be using to
prime I've already primed my eye I just
used the Mac Pro Longwear concealer to
prime my eyes I like you to the neck so
doesn't crease if you're looking if
you're like struggling to find a
concealer because you can see increases
bad then I really highly recommend get
in the pro longwear so if a foundation
I'm gonna using the dual airbrush
foundation and this is in honey beige is
a little bit too dark now because my
hands faded a little bit but once I
blended it all down to my neck it looks
fine so
now I'm just gonna add some Mac Studio
Fix fluid on top so you for casino I
think I'm going to use a Maybelline fit
me concealer because I've been obsessing
over this concealer lately it just I
just really like it I think this is in
shade light maybe I think is it doesn't
have a name on it but I'm sure it's in
light just feel like medium skin tones
oh not like the fair one like I think it
is just good light or medium right so I
don't know oh my god you guys I am so
excited for IMATS this year in London
because I literally the tickets are on
sale and I'm just like I think I'm just
going to go to like both days i Saturday
on Sunday because two days shopping of
makeup definitely and I was going to
take my Laura Mercier translucent
setting powder I'm just gonna set there
it's just like the only powder that I
can use the Baker because it doesn't
make it like cakey and that Mac one I
used to use quite a lot you can't really
break with that just make it like say
okay okay she feels horrible
okay so whilst it's baking I'm going to
contour I'm somebody use the hoola by
benefit bronzer I wish you love this
bronzer it's a perfect shade I'm going
to use my fierce phase f40 angled
contour brush
I can't believe by the way it somewhere
now has me has reached like ten million
subscribers like that is crazy but that
is actually crazy I love her video is
like she is literally the cutest person
ever just so relatable to a lot of paper
as what I feel so I'm just gonna go over
my eyebrows book because when I counted
I like the powder drops into my brown
and it goes a bit correct a few guys
know like if you guys get let me know
and your favorite products that would be
amazing because I wouldn't like trying
more things but I just been going online
and looking for makeup and I just don't
really know what to try and if you guys
that we don't your favorite products
that would be like stay helpful and then
I could try them or anything that you'd
want me to try and review them please
let me know and I'll do that for you so
it does this powder on I'm gonna put the
powder on my chin actually because my
chin like I say in every video is so
oily I get shy only I can't cope with it
now even by me putting like a loads of
powder on it by the end of the day it
will be cloudy is how it would be oily
as hell so moving on to the islands so
transition shade is Peach Smoothie which
is this one I'm gonna go in with that
and this brush is by Kiko edgy but it
number 200 let me know your favorite
makeup products or any products you want
me to try review and comment below and I
will purchase some of them obviously not
all of them cuz I'm not a millionaire
but ya know what
I can't believe by the way I'm like
nearly a hundred thousand subscribers
like that is crazy - you started this
thing can I have like ten thousand if
like that was like my goal from like
June this year to like January I was
like by January I'm gonna have ten
thousand subscribers and I've got like
nearly 90 that's crazy to me love
hearing your comments and feedback and
stuff
thank you have Adamo nuts so now I'm
gonna get in a move that shade was it's
called cupcake and I'm gonna use for
more news my Sigma e35 Tim bending but I
live for this brush I wanna buy it one
time
okay so now I'm using my mac 242 brush
I'm just gonna spray some mac fix+ and
she's a actually this is not the fixed
buses the charged water this is the
hydrated miss okay so now I'm gonna be
taking this Shay where is this good Wims
lim whimsical lesson it's good whimsical
and it's like this really nice shimmer
it's a foil shadow and it's a really
nice light like purple so yeah I'm gonna
be applying this all over my lid oh yeah
I'm really sorry about the holiday look
that's not yeah it will be up don't
worry it's just the footage because I
feel I'm going to go from having to like
download onto my laptop and about two
hours of the footage that I've been
going through is when I left my lips a
camera on my accident in my bag so it's
just film like the flip flop in my bag
it's just so annoying so I'm going to go
through down ride them all to see what
video it is and then delete the ones
that I want so it will be ups and
everything at Nicole's my nose is
running but I'm gonna take my Sigma
tapered ease 35 blending brush I'm just
gonna blend that is there's no harsh
line there okay so first for mascara I'm
gonna be using the l'oreal lash
architect 4d mascara this is my favorite
okay so i'm gonna apply the ceramic a
long lashes sorry to be boring and he
uses hey russia's again i'm gonna reuse
the ones from yesterday a for know when
you've worn them once and then the
second time you wear them they was like
bath oh and the art of the lash glue
that i'm using is the jammu eyelash
adhesive and i'm not gonna show you this
in camera because it just acknowledged
it-it's got all like dried-up glue on
the top of it so i'm not owning up cuz
ya think because it takes a bit pinky I
kind of wanna make it a bit more purple
so I'm gonna grab at it for an eyeshadow
palette and add a purple okay so I'm
gonna be using the morphe 35o palette I
think maybe this shade but just like a
really tiny bit let's try that I'm just
going back in with that shimmery purple
I'm just gonna pile a bit more on top
just to make it a little bit more
peppery
so then I'm just going to apply the
light my ocean when I go in with that
purple that I just applied to the cruise
which is this shade this one here is
quite dark I'm just going to apply a
little bit of that to my own under-eye
okay so now I'm going to apply some
mascara to my lashes say that looks a
lot better it's not so pink now more
purple which is why one in whatever I
some highlighter and I'm gonna be using
the lux highlight brush by zoeva I'm
just gonna spray some mac fix+ on the
brush because this highlight the mary
lou manizer by the balm is quite town
very highlight and so if you add a
little bit of mac fix+ to your brush
just dampen the brush a little bit it
just applies it a lot nicer
making the Sigma medium sweeper a 54
brush just going to again spray Cermak
fixed sauce on the brush and then when I
apply the highlighter to my inner corner
of my eye and my brow bone you can do
two different lip things just you could
add like a really nice nude glossy lip
but I'm gonna be applying at the lip
land liquid lipstick and this is in
double down and it's a really bright
purple this is what I'm gonna be wearing
I would recommend some in life desert
suede which is really really nice okay
so this is the finished look I hope you
guys enjoyed this tutorial and this hat
is from Sarah okay I don't even think
it's expensive everything cuz I 11
pounds something but yeah I hope you
