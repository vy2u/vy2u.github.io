summer lookbook I will link all of the
items in the description box below
along with my discount code which is
Holly Boone 15 so in case you want to
purchase any that I'll be in the
description box so for this first outfit
I paired these like round camel colored
shorts with this really cute crochet
crop top I absolutely love this outfit
you can wear it up like you could dress
it up and wear it in the evening and you
could also wear it for out there's over
some sandals and if I was going to wear
this out in the evening I'd probably
just put some wedges with this and it's
probably for like holiday for going for
like drinks or food but yeah really love
it and also when it's like the beach for
out the daytime with some sandals or
just like some flip-flops
okay so I am absolutely obsessed with
these ripped jeans shorts just anything
this ripped Jean I am legit obsessed
with and so I feel like I'm definitely
going to be living in these shorts in
the summer and but I decided to pair
these shorts with this really cute
t-shirt that says girl going on it I
love this I think it's so cute but it
was I love the color of it it's like a
really nice peachy nudie shade and but I
would probably wear this outfit to like
a festival I'd pretty just put some
trainers with this or I'd pretty wear
like some flip-flops with this to go to
let the beach or something but I just
love this outfit I think it's so cute
okay so I've got a little bit carried
away with the music but it's all good
and so basically I love this jacket if I
was going to wear this outfit to a
festival I would definitely add the
jacket and just because I think it's
very like festival vibe you know I'm
saying I'm fit yeah I love this jacket
it's so cute but also if I'm just going
to wear it casually or we just work like
all black but yeah I love it
okay so next I've got this really nice
black crochet tassel II cropped up and
it's halter neck it goes low at the back
it's really nice I love how it goes low
at the back I'm going to be taking this
and hollowed me definitely I feel like
this is very holiday kind of like in the
evening I'm pretty put some like wedges
with it or some heels and also with
these shorts you can definitely wear
this like a festival with some trainers
but I really really like this
okay so next I've got this white
three-piece set and the trousers are
like flared three four lamps I will show
you a little bit further on in this
video because it didn't focus it was
brilliant and but yeah so it comes with
the trousers the crop top and the jacket
the sleeveless jacket and this is
definitely an evening outfit for me like
I would put some sandal heels of this if
I was going up like a really nice meal
and also like I got in London like quite
a lot so I would definitely wear this
out there for food and political clubs
are going to really really love this I
didn't get so classy and so nice so yeah
so then I got this baby pink waterfall
jacket it's really really long and I
love waterfall jackets i literally have
every single color you can ever imagine
and they're just perfect to just put any
outfit up like the guy with literally
anything like dresses it shoot most
things so I actually live in these and
this color is so pretty for summer I
like it's perfect summer color it's
really really thin it's not one of those
really heavy ones at all but I would
definitely wear this to go out for
cocktails and my friends or out for like
a meal and just pair it with some like
pointy pointy Hills probably
so this outfit is perfect for me for
like meetings and things like I do have
quite a few meetings sometimes and this
is just really really nice like I would
pair this with some like black pointy
heels
I love these trousers they fit literally
perfect
I love high-waisted trousers they're
just so much more comfy and then I've
just paid it with the white crop top and
then this black blazer
so then I've just switched the jacket to
this white one it's like a long line
blazer and so sometimes I don't want to
look too black so this is perfect to add
with this outfit just to give it more
white and not too much black and but
these jackets again you can let you pair
them with absolutely anything like I I
have so many of these just because I'm
obsessed so you can put them with
dresses trousers it shoot anything and
they'll always look so so nice so yeah I
love love love love love these jackets
so this outfit is definitely my favorite
out of everything and these again
high-waisted trousers I live for
high-waisted trousers are just so much
more comfy I love this color as well
it's so nice for some are like I
literally love these and so I would
probably wear these again to just go out
for food go out for drinks and my
friends or just like pretty much every
day like you can put sandals and these
and make it a little bit more casual not
so dressed up
but I literally love these and then I
added this really silky longline blazer
