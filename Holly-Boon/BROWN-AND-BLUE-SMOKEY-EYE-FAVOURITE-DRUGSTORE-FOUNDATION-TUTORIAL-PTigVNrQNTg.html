tutorial for you guys and I wish you
something bronzy with a pop of blue
because I've got contact lenses in so it
just makes my eyes pop when you put a
little bit of blue but yeah my hair is
inspired by Cameron here on YouTube and
Instagram
and her name is I love Sarah surah he I
think I say I'm not sure and but she did
he shoot on how to get hell out there so
I'll link it below so no loser who asked
me she's just amazing I love her YouTube
channel and but yeah I hope you guys
enjoying this if you want to find out
how about this makeup look then please
keep watching
just quickly my contact lenses are from
Desio and these are the lighter grey one
I just found switching up my eye look
today so first of all when take my tart
shape tape and carve up my brow let me
know if you guys are eating updated
browser shah rukh so have another one is
that some time and the ones you were
brows in a tutorial which it takes up so
much time it's really long it takes
about half an hour to do my eyebrows so
I know the video to be ridiculously long
for you guys let me know if you want to
do that
this brush is the sigma line perfect IE
68 brush i do have a code which is holly
and if you want to get anyone else
really could fill up cognate your eyes
because it's like a slightly brushes up
it's really easy to use i feel like i
feel like i should do more like story
time videos in one channel i actually
have so many funny stories i have to
share you guys ready to be between the
other day i could about the stories aces
are the one where i had my operation of
a stuck in the bath
I'm just using Laura Mercier translucent
powder by the way basically when I had
my brave job I had seen 43 days and my
mom come to see me my sister came to see
me and we're whoever and then I was
on my own for a little while and you
have this like it's a buzzer thing so is
anything wrong it can just press it in
the nurse comes in sing with a button in
the very long basically to the stretch
very far so I always basically delay
instead like I was bored and with brain
i watch so much TV is a joke
so i decided it would be a good idea to
play around with the buttons and pair on
my chair like that we're back up my
knees up like just cuz I've seen people
do some adverts and unlike in
films and stuff like you simply will do
it in six funny so I was like right I
want to try it so I put my knees that
was high as they could go slow right
into my chest and I put the back without
reading highs messing around
and because the monitor thing does it
stretch very far I want to put it down
and if you just rest it there and it
fell off the bed and I'm stuck in this
bed where I can't get round to press to
get the buzzer so apart buzzer the nerve
to come and help me and I can't put the
bed back because the buttons were on the
monitor and it's on the floor I can't
reach it so I'm just sat there like I've
got a little table over there with my
mobile phone and I'm just like Oh
melilla I need to try and reach my phone
because this is really hurt and now like
I've had an operation and I'm stuck and
I'm really hurt like I can't move and so
I'm starting and AJ pulling about an
hour and then I'm crying I'm like Holly
what's what like I'm cry and everything
I was like in so much pain
and I had to like I believe know how
much to do it by machine over at my
mobile fighter in my sister's to come
help me but she came in and started
laughing at me I was like not funny not
funny um this fight took right Anala it
is funny it's a funny story by the time
it wasn't funny I just used a Peach
Smoothie is my transition color and now
I'm going is think I'm going to use my
morphe 35o Empire I need as much I
really like it there's like this shade
right here from this palette on my Sigma
Sears crease brush yeah feel like I
actually really like what you did was
three times in really laughs I know some
of them laugh bacon people just say that
for luck video we're still in staying in
some last of the line and all
I'm just getting my transition color I
which is Peachtree really different
brush and I was you Sigma brushes but I
won't see my favorite I should probably
try more Russia should nine but I really
love these
so last few years so I always do feel
like I've had a couple of these about
two years now and they're still going
strong so they're good investment
because I lost a long time just choked
are also is from pre orphan just too
much and I in a new list wrong Chanel
actually just real quick consider price
someone black lip conditioner well it's
a very dry I love this stuff and use it
for months
okay now I'm gonna go to a slightly
darker shade so I know I was fish so you
dry really use the same brush which is
the diffused crew
I'm just going to do this all over my
lid look just really slight lightly and
then I went around the brush which I've
got my transition color on and then go
over it to be very soft so I'm flying it
with this fluffy brush so it's not I'm
not packing on lawyers of color these
are the new Marc Jacobs gel I groans I
really love them I've been using right
all the other colors and we try this
brown rich shade a little bit more rich
I'm gonna go with that one
guys I really wanted this shade right
here it's good earthquake and it's going
to run it along my top lash line
you're just so creamy and really easy to
blend out where is it most much brush by
Sigma so job really well got the zoomed
in as far today guys eraser it is
because my camera just keeps going out
of focus when i zoom in for straight
inside and when you get a new lens bear
with it literally bring it into a little
wind
please going to be like a really smashed
to feel used to it
this smudge brush by Sigma is really
good okay so I'm just going to apply
some mascara to my lashes I'm using the
benefit they are real and then for Ashes
we're going to use the houses ash iconic
and the lash glue I'm using this to me
rushes some going to eyes my fingers
with my tweezers so nice just so much
easier with tweezers
I'm just taking a little bit of the
Sigma gel liner and I'm going to run
this in my top waterline gives that
fellow look and also it helps to blend
in the eyelashes
okay so whilst my eyes dry I'm gonna
start of my face so first of all I'm
going to take my elements biotech skin
and Jasmine day cream which she's been
my favorite like kind of like a free
moisturizer it remove it and I do like
that I have super moisturized but
sometimes a little bit thick so this is
a good bit more lightweight to set up
the more hydrated you are the better
your base looks okay then to minimize my
pores I'm going to use the infallible
mattifying base by L'Oreal and then
after that mineral eye cream and we need
the ginseng refreshing eye cream to
brighten in deep laughs this stuff's
really really good so a little bit pinky
so it kinda it does help to discover
dark circles
so for my foundation today I'm going to
talk to you guys about my favorite
drugstore combination foundation and I
discovered this about other day like two
weeks a week a week ago he was doing to
go I'm not sure I remember anyway
Lauria up with their new infallible
range so I was like okay this is
protocol cover and I already had this
one form eight years ago because I used
to use this foundation all the time and
but I felt like it wasn't at the cover
the coverage that I wanted so I kinda
stopped using it but anyway and I think
you guys remember that the old formula
and the alpha or the True Match was like
my favorite I loved it so much it was in
a Cano bottle the screw screwed up you
can't now get it in the UK and I feel
when they change the packaging they
change the formula that formula was a
lot more full coverage and I loved it is
on my favorite foundation anyway I
decided to mix this proto cover with
this foundation and just to see if it
would make a difference because I want
it's a bit more full coverage but I love
this foundation so I makes you see
together and it's now my favorite
all-time dailies got your something with
daily foundation routine because my
hourglass stick foundation will always
always be my favorite foundation by it's
so expensive to be wearing every single
day you can't wear everyday because it
runs are so quickly and it's 42 pounds
you don't mean it so it's really
expensive so I've been loving that I
found this because this has been like my
every single day Foundation and Olmstead
so lovely life you know I'm going to
show you what I do I got this
the total cover a shade amber and I
caught this you have the not the shade
of it on the lid
I lost the lid so I've actually never
existed
I can't remember what I look at all no
intimacy one line I saw a link is below
anyway but yeah makes me feel to go well
if you guys will see one in so first
already at the total cover the total
cover by yourself for me is right amount
it is very very very like very very very
full coverage just a little bit too dry
from the I prefer more of them rather
than super matte finish you know what my
thunder suffer more of that satin finish
and but full coverage so this gives me
the assume final mix together just gives
you a satin finish um but a full
coverage so I just got this foundation
around must say it's very dark this
color the way it's mixed is rather one
sort of perfect shade because I feel I
would glory out there light shades are
very much M got pinky undertone which I
don't like so this shade mixed with this
one is the perfect shade for me so yeah
I'm just going to use my Sigma 3d
blender fellows to the Beauty Brenda now
as you guys know and then I'll just dab
this into my tree March and with a apply
this on top we're like me and you love a
full coverage but you don't want to see
from that finish this is ideal for use
but yeah when I use them by themselves
and the true match is not Lots full
coverage as that as I would like and
then the total cover is waiting up so
these to go out or a dream and they're
not expensive
yay so this is the finish score just
isn't it - satin full coverage finish so
I really want like a really bright under
eyes today and we need a blue underneath
basically I don't really reflect my dark
circles because when you use Blues and
your dark side when your eyes are what
that blue tone to them it can make your
dark circles it's worse so I really want
to bright under eyes today to make sure
that doesn't happen so and we're too
much backup under-eye brightening
corrector and I'm going to take some of
this on line took my cream color brush
another good color correct palette if
you want to get kind of correct
I bought this ages ago black this I
tried to lower our undecidable on the
other day it's really good so it's
really creamy and really easy to blend
out so yeah I really love that
no Donna wake up
yeah I'd remaining close he's gonna burn
that you're a mess if my 3d Brenda now
we're going to go in with concealer and
I'm going to use my heart-shaped tape
and shade lights medium I'm not going to
apply this directly under my eyes when I
blend it in I'll blend it up you can
slightly put up the edges first of all
and then I'm will press it so I'm going
to take my through my translucent powder
and I'm going to bake a little bit under
my eyes who don't want to decrease in
and then I'm going to apply powder over
else as well
next my Bruns I'm gonna take might give
me sunny originated rail and then we're
going to take my Sigma fan brush I've
seen a few people using fan brushes to
use bronzers on nikkietutorials and
Cameron Hughes I love Sandra heat fans
did it a people would unison and so it's
actually works so much better
okay so before I move on to contour a
lot of the stuff I'm going to finish off
my eye
vacuuming my morphe palette I'm going to
take my Sigma exact friend this is the
e30 to brush and I'm going to take that
lighter shade first of all so this one
here and then I'm going to use that one
so I'm going to try and keep this is
close to my lash line just try your eyes
doing my head in it hits me better she's
moving around I don't get it up tight
enough three innings and then I visit
our darkest days now then for my
waterline which is blue shade just from
the Marc Jacobs and Joe I crown range
this is shade overnight so I'm going to
run this in my what I ended up with it
smudge it down slightly only it like the
senior science rep to the waterline and
then take my smudge brush by 6 miles I'm
going to smudge it out okay and then for
my lower lashes I'm going to use the
L'Oreal telescopic how lazin does this
do it would blue eyes I mean if you've
got blue eyes uses look I'm sorry what
you need to you have to so I check my
other styles drconsul care I'm gonna
take this shade right here on my fan

nostalgia palette and I'm going to take
