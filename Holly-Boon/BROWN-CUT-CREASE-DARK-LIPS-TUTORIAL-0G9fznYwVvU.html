eyebrow using the Becca oh my coverage
concealer and this is in shade banana
I look like Rosie I'm so I'm just going
to set that using the laura mercier
translucent setting powder go for my
transition color I'm going to take Peach
Smoothie by makeup geek and this Kiko is
304 ah
I guess after that I'm going to take my
take frappe by makeup geek and my winged
liner brush by Sigma which is the area
six brush you can use code Holly for
money off I'm just going to carve out
basically where I want my cut crease to
be so you want to just apply it like
just above the crease you don't want to
do it in the crease because you wait so
yeah
I'm going to take my medium sweep brush
by Sigma and just blend the out that
lines is not harsh
and then going to take some of that
shade frappe on this brush which comes
with the modern research pilot finger
plays a grenade so I don't know anyway
then I'm going to take show you Coco
bear and the wind going to brush and I'm
going to cover again
Oh sugar
next I'm going to take my soft ochre
Paint Pot by Matt I'm going to apply
this all over the lid
you
using my same brush which is an activity
where take shade ice cream by makeup
geek which is like a shimmery white
shade and I'm just going to apply that
on top
so I'm now going to wing my line and I'm
going to use the Inglot gel liner in 77
which is matte black and I am obsessed
with this you know and my winged liner
brush by is a Weaver which is the
three-one-seven brush
okay so four lashes I'm going to use the
huge Beauty lower lashes
okay so cool primer I'm going to use
mushriks fiber water as always because
you know I'm upset so I'll just find it
really hydrating it's really nice
insolence okay so then for foundation
I'm going to use the NARS sheer glow
this is in a medium sized dark one I
don't really know how to pronounce
ourselves put it in the description box
I think this is my new favorite
foundation you know if I always stay on
see I never find foundation that I love
but I really really love this one and I
never really love foundations so pull up
a finally fun one that I'm just like
yeah cuz I used to love like the studio
fix fluid but the only thing I hate of I
was east oxidize so bad right after an
hour or my face would just look marine
orange so I just like got repot off
using it but the consistency of the
product I used to love like it worked a
bunch of pretty much every skin type as
well it's really so really versatile
foundation it really go but it's just
optimizes really really bad which is so
annoying
I'd say if I was going to use it I'd
probably get like a couple of shades
lighter than what need
so then after kind of an hour of it
oxidizing it probably can be the right
color
literally
so if you can see I'm going to use the
NARS radiant creamy concealer in custard
okay so I'm just going to set that using
my translucent powder laura mercier as
per usual
bronzer obviously I was using Mac give
me Sun and mighty face mr. right brush
this is a powder brush
yeah I'm not gonna go click on tour
today guys scared proms wrong wrong
wrong
and then going to take my winged liner
brush by Sigma which is the ESX barcia
small one take some of my gel liner and
I'm just going to run this literally my
top wall on
then I'm going to run through this in
the bottom waterline as well just tool
it to about halfway to opens up your
eyes
you
the reason don't real telescope it this
is really good what I'm nauseous
okay so for highlight first I'm going to
take my iconic London a strobe in stick
and I'm going to apply some of this
first of all because it's them I want to
apply a cream before I apply powder dust
it's bloom like a lot more intense
okay so then on top of that I'm going to
take my Laura Mercier peach mosaic
shimmer block I'm just going to mix
these two shades out here together
so lastly Phillips I'm going to take the
rink on cosmetics liquid lipstick this
is a color range and this is in shade
fell em I think it's gonna be LEM even
sharper so say it but mofo anyway
okay so that is the finished look I hope
