talk three video today because those of
you said you prefer it so just like me
doing a voiceover so rigid on my
eyebrows to save time because it takes
me ages to get my eyebrows half of them
so now I'm just priming using the Nivea
for men post shape um I'm so annoyed I
wake up this one is a bigger spot on my
forehead and then do that one here as
well right there I'm not sure what I'm
gonna call this makeup look yet I'm
gonna need you guys help
I'm gonna ask on snapchat because I have
quite a lot of redness around my nose
area sometimes I have quite a lot of
redness here but it's not too bad today
but I'm gonna be using the Florida's
color corrector primer by Barry M this
is also good at minimizing pores so I'm
just going to apply this to the center
of my face so just here really everyone
knows it really is pore minimizing its
don't get it in your eye or stings like
my foundation I'm gonna be using the
Estee Lauder Double Wear and this is in
shade cashew and this is because I wear
this on nights out and I'm always really
can so this color is like really dark
but it always matches my tan so don't
panic
so now I'm going to be taking my Becca
under eye brightening corrector and this
fierce face f20 can see the brush I'm
just going to apply this to my under eye
because I have black circles not black
but dark circle I got black so
everything I don't even know why I try a
new accent them say about accents of any
of you guys noticed I was trying to your
accents in this so cringe
so now for concealer I'm gonna be using
the Maybelline and II age I eraser this
is in trade like haven't you just an
agent Ari bought the other day come on
we must you monster
well that's why see what publish wet see
okay so now I'm just gonna bake that I
was done baking the concealer I'm just
gonna go in my Chanel bronzer I got this
for Christmas and I was gonna practice
two ages ago but I just didn't really
get around to buying it so I got it for
Christmas
and then most of you asked me how I use
it so I like to use a duo fiber brush
and basically just spray the brush in
the bronzer and then apply it I just
think it applies it really nicely
because we're just gonna dust off that
powder and this is the mr. right brush
by two-face how cute is that it's got a
little bow on it so cute
so once that's done I'm just gonna go in
my Laura Mercier setting powder again
just going to clean up this line here
so now I'm going to go in with eyes and
they're going to be using the morphe 35
P palette I'm just going to use two
shades of brown what these loads of
different shades so I'm just gonna be
using this shade here and this one here
hey guys they're taking that like a
brown shade I'm gonna be this is basic
you're just going to be my crease color
my transition shade so I'm just gonna
work that into the crease and just above
the crease as well
so you hide that shade you're then going
to go in with the dark brown and you're
just going to apply this all over the
lid once you've done that you're just
going to blend that out
I mean that's pretty much it it's so
quick so easy so if you'd like a
beginner eyeshadow this is like such a
good I like to go useful you can just
keep building up this dark brown shade
here just till we get it dark as you
want add I like mine to be quite dark so
I'm gonna pack on as much scar I'd like
hand
excuse my name's I'm gonna get them done
I'm just trying to give them a break
from Joe because I started to go really
weak say from mascara I'm gonna be using
the better than sex mascara by tear face
I'm just gonna place them as go on
before I apply false lashes so now for
lashes I'm going to be using the
sorrowing UK long mash these are always
been a favorite one as you guys know
I'm just going to replace them
miscarriages - been days in my natural
lashes with the fake ones and this is
the room where London volume flash
mascara so now for the lower lash line
I'm going to go in with the darker brown
shade I'm just going to apply this the
sort of I can't wait I don't want to
bring me right across
so this is the best part about the home
a couple of the guy so yeah I'm gonna be
using champagne pop by Jacqueline Hill
because I just got this that yesterday I
haven't actually used this yet so I'm
excited
so what a reason is I have angled
contour brush I do prefer this to apply
my highlighter on my cheekbones so
okay you know what
I see what the hypes about is color is
to die for
is this so golden and love it
I said for this book I'm going to show
you two different lip colors these two
are my favorite I've just got some
scruffy black t-shirt on by the way
because I end up getting makeup up all
over me so I'm going to show you
chocolate honey by Too Faced and then
chocolate cherries by Too Faced these
two colors look so good with this eye
look I'll be living for this one every
day but then I wore this one in my
snapchat Q&amp;amp;A and you guys were like
today's so bomb so I was like you both
so I'm gonna start off with chocolate
honey and I'm using the stripped down
Mac a lip liner because this works
really well with this lip color it just
basically spot-on really don't for you
can see that but yeah pretty much
spot-on
okay so this one is chocolate honey this
is the one that I've been wearing like a
daily basis it's not my new favorite
nude this is a very brown nude
the texture of the products is nice it's
creamy it's not dry it's not my business
I like very shiny either so yeah this
has been the one that I have literally
been living for so now I wish I knew the
other colors there's chocolate cherries
and this lip liner is in plum now this
is not a perfect match this is more
purpley this is very like dark red berry
kind of color but this is like the
closes look pens with iPads so and I
have to use a lip pencil wise it goes
everywhere so just bear with me because
when you ready to go about it looks fine
so
yeah those two of my favorite lip colors
and I'm loving this one as well at the
moment but for sort of every single day
like a nice nude I do like Chinese
chocolate honey if you guys want you can
wondering where you can get them from
you can actually get them from debenhams
online and they don't always have all
the colors in there which is kind of
annoying I think they sent out quite
quick but they do have them on there so
lastly I'm just going to spray my face
with mac fix+ just bedont it's a powdery
so there we go that's the finished look
I hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial
I'm gonna do a video for you on how to
get the slicked-back ponytail because
this is just the clip-on ponytail by
beauty works I don't use that clip in
hair extensions because they like pull
my hair so this is just it to your
clip-on ponytail Barbie it works but I
will show you how to get this hair look
may I make sure you give it a thumbs up
if you enjoyed it and I'll see you guys
next time bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
