because I didn't really plan on filming
but that is just look and I was like I
bet everyone's going to ask me to film
it so I'm going to move it I am just
going to start my morphe 35o m palette
this part is lit I'm not blind
I love them well matte shades and just
three on one colors so I love this when
using it one time yeah when you use this
color for my transition shade when I
take my pick my diffused crease bro so
me I'm Paige and miss you one other is P
Louise are going to do a masterclass
we're gonna do is a livestream just
because we feel like it was better
because people then around the world can
continue and I lock through system in
arm in two bites not further or in
America like I want to I want to watch
them stuff so we are actually going to
do it a live stream but as well I don't
have to travel anywhere if I do not I
mean so we let you know the drill flat
once you've figured out how we're going
to do it I'm excited I know it on a
masters as well I try to show as many
tips and tricks as I have any hats any
things
simplify things I hope them over this
reddish brown shade here on my backstage
large I blend the brush after I filmed
this and done we need to do I'm going to
go into town because no joke right
I don't even why did this on roof my
sheep is so I went shopping with Todd at
the weekend and we went into All Saints
and iOS's I was just blasting Singh from
there like I think I know why wasn't so
expensive but is not many shops in
Cambridge I end up just blind so from
there but anyway commend all didn't
avoid as a staffer he only check the
price of things
picked it up and boy and then I go home
and I was like I bought this like black
crop today and I looked at the price of
it when I got home and it was a hundred
and eighteen pounds a you Pharrell 118
pounds for a cropped hoodie so I'm
taking that back today that is a joke
I'm sorry that is such a joke
Ohio Street prices name is designer
brand they're high street like
so ridiculous so ridiculous
hi I mean I stay like mocking robbery
that that should not be okay I need to
start looking at the prices of things
because I don't do that
I just pick up and buy it I don't
actually ask how much it is or don't
actually look at the prices it's really
bad and then I buy it and I'm like he
gets the tool you can't be like oh no
don't worry John means a bit awkward so
yeah boy let's try it till we magic
cream and it was like 70 quid and I was
like oh my god me war I'm just a sucker
for good packaging I like I saw it just
there looking all pretty on the shot
silvery counter and I was like it looks
so nice like it would say nice on my
bedroom side you know so I'm just going
with the start signal this darker shade
there and I'm just applying that in the
outer part of the crease and the outer
part of the eye
selects you to about half way have you
guys heard about the highlighted the
kinda highlighters you were getting them
in the post of no actual product in them
are no highlight just a package in I was
how old and like there was a go on to it
are issues I go when I come ready for
like to film snapchat and she opened it
as they highlight in there is you our
fans off would you be how off
would you be I'm just using my
heart-shaped tape for my lint and carve
out my lid I'm using the line Perfector
brush by Sigma
I'm going to take my bake precision
brush my thick brush play Sigma and some
of my translucent powder by Laura
Mercier and we set that so before I
leave it out I like to do my wing blast
because so like going over like chunky
get out the gel liner is so hard to get
neat so we use my Sigma gel liner is a
recently and this sigma e06 brush is not
my favorite roshni my liner with the tip
of a dot of concealer and I'm just going
to carve it out with my line for sex
desire so the glitter glue and we'll
take the ash because my ex politically
this one is good but when else and
survives it releasing so it's okay but
if you know very really good glitter
glue that we know I want to try some I
was going to fly this all over the lid
and then I'm using the certified that
are I don't know what shade this is
basically like a gold and a silver mixed
together these graves are so nice like
fast enough
now we need to go over our wedding
because of the sea I'll you up so
I'm using the same Carolina and the same
brush placement up at the door I mean on
the new video signer
I can't God or whatever I'm doing well
enough and so of course I need me to say
what after the musing because you
already know reason house of lash iconic
I can't help it guys and so okay first
of all prime I'm going to use my L'Oreal
infallible and mattifying base re you
already know the drill
I love this for like my pause because it
really helps minimize them Nathan we
take my shot at Tilbury a magic cream I
have to used under foundation actually
works really well just kinda like to
make sure that my face is reading we
strive my neck and stuff so I apply any
makeup
okay so for foundation math I feel like
I just repeat myself as I but this is
like from my favorite ever since I
discovered it
so the m5 will total carb art mix it did
or Outremer so I just going to apply
some of the total color first of all
we've got some of this around the face
and then on my Sigma 3 D Brenda I'm
going to take the true match and then
the Dorian so we need my Becca under-eye
brightening corrector and we take this
heart shape tape and shade light to
medium
okay so I'm just going to set my under
eyes as increased quickly just use my
Laura Mercier translucent powder so I
throw down a cream contour today so I'm
going to take the eye ponycon down one
of these called pigment stick so I think
I'm going to go for shade three point
two and the shade is quite warm but I
kind of want it to look a little bit
more warm and then I'm just going to
apply some of this darker shade which is
four point three
these than before and I really like the
last time okay so that brush definitely
bends that out and I see you guys can
see that kind of assets renders it out
it's really not warmed up my face
so these call our offices are going to
work to contour such because it's a warm
shade so instead of that like really
contour look I'm kind of just going for
more of a bronzey look I know I like
that I know I like this brush I couldn't
remember why but it's because it blends
up creams nicely really nicely I am
going to set my chin some Howard are not
personally hit it was poorly realizes
your pauses on ice and power on so I'm
going to take that that reddish brown
shade there first of all the lighter
version those two shades are just a
light one and I'm going to take my Mac
217 and I'm going to take some of that a
Sigma gel liner and yto six brush I'm
going to apply that in the waterline
against my lower lashes I'm going to
take the L'Oreal telescopic so if I
highlight I'm going to take my iconic
London illuminator drop then on top of
that I'm going to take my break it from
undersides a Beverly Hills is the Sun
dipped one I'm going to take this shade
summer on why a nostalgic a23 so look
