through video about my hair again
because I changed from clippings to pre
bonded and a lot of you asked me a lot
of questions on Instagram about it so I
figured I would make a video and so yeah
basically the reason why I brought to
pre bondage was because I wasn't happy
with the clippings just because I'm very
lazy when it comes to my hair I'll spend
hours and hours doing my makeup but when
it comes to my hair I'm super super lazy
and clipping them in and taking them out
and with that stuff was just a nightmare
for me also with clipping them in and I
started to sort of feel like I was
losing hair and getting like bald
patches and things and from wearing them
too much so I figured I would go back to
pre bondage because I know had a problem
with them in the first place
the reason why I did get four of them
was because the hair I had put in was of
low quality and every time I rushed it
the hair would fall out everywhere and I
just really really got put off them but
I changed and I went to beauty x hair
extensions and got a really amazing
quality hair and I'm literally obsessed
now so this is the hair o always so if
you're wondering what the hell I'm
wearing I'm basically wearing my
dressing-gown because I looked in my
wardrobe for 20 Amazigh no not feeling
anything
and I've seriously need special pair I'm
just not fit in any of my pies at the
moment so yeah
chinma dressing out on and but yeah so
this is the hair super super thick like
crazy thick look at the ends like think
I'm amazing like I just this is
literally I've woken up with my hair
this this morning and I've just
basically brushed it and if you what pre
bonded hair extensions are and they're
basically glued into your hair and I
know that sounds crazy right but a lot
of people say they're damaging and
they're bad for your hair and things
like that but if you look after your
hair and you do everything that you're
supposed to do you wash it with the
right things and
you obviously don't sleep you can't see
it with the bonds wet so you're drying
your head before you go to sleep and if
you do everything you supposed to do
then they're not going to damage your
hair if you get lazy with it and you
don't look after them then obviously
they are going to ruin your hair and so
yeah yeah so this is basically the
button I don't even know if you can see
it they are literally like like pretty
much invisible you can hardly see them
and which is great obviously you don't
want to be able to see all these random
like this glue in your hair but um this
is them when I'm watching my hair I use
the beauty wax
paranoia Jing argan oil shampoo and
conditioner because these are specially
designed for the hair extensions and
they make the hair go really nice and
shiny and soft so and yeah that's why I
use to wash the hair with I also have
the DC where expounder rushing argan oil
mask and I will use this on just the
extensions when I feel like they need a
bit more than conditioner and we think a
bit dry or if I've gone out a night out
I've curled them and I've used a lot
heat on them then I will use this and
also have the heat protection spray as
well by Beauty works and and I spray
this on my hair before I blow-dry or why
straighten it or anything like that and
just to keep the healthy nice and stop
it from getting damaged and I also have
the argan oil serum which is an oil and
basically what I would do is when the
hairs wet I'll just put some of this
through the ends and then when I blow
dry it goes really really nice and shiny
it looks really healthy so and I'm a
massive fan of this I said I use this
pretty much every single time I wash my
hair and the summer I went to to get
these done is called vivid and hair
salon in Northampton and the ladies it
on my hair was a lady wood Hannah which
she's lovely
everyone in there is very nice and
friendly and they are crazy talented at
what they do I was watching them
transform people's dry dull hair to like
amazing like bouncy curly blonde hair
and I just like it really what they
really made me want to go blonde but
more by the black light black muscle
drinkin and I got 20 inch extensions
because I like them to be super long and
then when I Cal them I like them to be
sort of stay long so yeah I get 20 inch
and I'd say if you're going to get them
done to invest in a hair extension brush
which basically looks like this that the
nasty hair it basically does are this
and it's just because then you can
actually brush right at the top of your
hair so you can brush through the bombs
like this and it doesn't hurt so see I'd
recommend getting a hair extension brush
because if you just use a normal hair
brush and you try and brush the top here
you're going to get all the bonds caught
and this is gonna hurt so I'm definitely
invest in a hair essential brush think
these already like ten to fifteen pounds
are not that much so I'd invest in one
definitely and so yeah I think that's
everything I think I've covered
everything I hope I have anyway because
I'm so bad at these videos um yeah if
I've missed anything then please comment
below and I will turn on some of your
questions and sorry what I get and three
replies to all of your questions and
some of you have settings on your
YouTube where I can't actually reply
which is really annoying and so it's
like I'm ignoring you but I promise
you're not
and sometimes I just miss comments or
idea for dress for that bar I do try and
go through Arthur's millions like hat
and so yeah if I've missed any things
anything that you run annoyed and please
comment below and I will answer your
question but I'm thank you for watching
and I will see you again next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
