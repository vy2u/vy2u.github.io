all about my hair because a lot of you
have asking for this video so yeah and
so I'm going to start by saying this is
not my real hair and I wish it was it
would save you so much money but it's
not
I did get pre bonded hair extensions
which are like individual strands and
you get them like glued in and I do love
these they've never ruined my hair I've
got lot of people say oh like why'd you
get Gruen certainly ruin your hair and
but if you look after your hair and they
do not ruin your hair so yeah and my
natural hair if I can find it
same where natural hair is literally
this long the reason why it's so short
is because I was stupid I was like 16
and I had black hair and I really want
is to go like bleach blonde I was like
obsessed with Christina Aguilera and I
was like oh my god like I want to be her
so I decided to Beach my hair and and it
all fell out and I think she reached it
in like like my whole head three times
in three days and my hair was actually
like this long and now it's like air but
it was even worse like it was literally
like this short I had like bald patches
like stumps of hair but yeah I would
attach a picture but it's like glitchy
horrendous like I do not even want to
see that it makes me feel sick but yeah
so I've tried loads and different hair
extensions before I've tried tape ins of
tried and my curly I've tried leave and
the reason why I haven't really liked
all of them is because tape ins they
ruined my hair so I've never get them
ever again weave and I feel like my head
can free book an itch from a scalp like
I just know how do you for a Danish
check it out and then my credits I do
like micro loops I think they're better
for your head and the ones I've gotten
at the moment but when I have a shower
wash my hair they literally fall out and
so yeah not loving them and I'm clipping
hair extensions so I have tried slightly
different brands like because my hair
was actually this short I was like any
hair extensions I wish you what hair
extensions since I was about 14 and just
like thickness and then obviously with
my hair snapped off so yeah em so I've
tried so many different brands I'm not
going to name in shame any of them but a
lot of them are so overpriced and they
tell you that they're going to be double
drawn and then they get here and they're
like thick at the top and then at the
bottom they're like right and I've also
had hair extensions before where they're
like you're going to clip them in and
then the clips like shot everything the
clips I fall off and and yeah so I've
tried so many different ones and I've
never actually found a set of clippings
I've been 100% happy with and so then I
came across Bellamy hair extensions and
I saw them on Instagram and I was like
oh my god these are amazing and I saw
Kylie Jenner brought her range with them
and and I was like okay these must be
really really good they've got like a
million followers on Instagram and say
yeah I purchased them in UK pounds I got
the Lilly ghalichi 260 gram hair
extensions and they cost me 200 pounds
and that was live delivery so I thought
that was really really good for the hair
that you get and you get so much hair
and it's so thick and it's shiny and
it's just amazing so yeah when I get
these taken out and what you want to
grow now I will probably won't get the
patent I'll just wear my Lilly ghalichi
hair extensions and so this is them they
are literally amazing they're super
thick they're shiny and they are human
hair they're amazing so yeah so they
also come with this
really really cute hanger and you can
hang them up in your wardrobe or hang
them up where everyone and they're not
going to get on my edge and horrible and
yeah
and so yeah I absolutely love these I'm
so obsessed and with these the reason
why I got some was because my hair at
the moment isn't very thick it's quite
thin and also when I want to curl it and
it goes too short and I just thought out
the length so I got these these a 20
inch um I do actually think these might
be a little bit longer than 20 and I
said it to a two inch buddy I don't know
why but they seem a bit longer and I'm
not complaining because long hair yeah
we all really long hair
and so yeah I literally love these so
much and they also come with this really
cool like travel case and so if you go
it away anywhere and you can take these
in your travel case which is really
really cool also sort of obviously they
don't get like mad or anything like that
and so yeah I've actually seas for 200
pounds it took about a week to come to
the UK just over a week I was really
surprised I thought they were going to
take ages and and yeah so basically
Bellamy emailed me and gave me a coupon
code and said any of my followers or
anyone that's like watch my videos of
things and watched Apache sees you can
use my code at checkout and you will get
discount which is amazing for you guys
so I will link that below for you and
say yeah I've tried so many so many so
many hair extensions and these are
amazing and I would literally recommend
anyone getting these and I am literally
in love of them and who wouldn't want
her an illegal each let's be honest and
so yeah if you guys are looking at
getting clippings I cannot recommend
these enough I am obsessed with them and
I've tried so many in the past and these
are literally my favorite and so yeah I
hope you guys enjoyed this video and
I'll see you again next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
