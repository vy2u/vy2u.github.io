about my boob job because I did it one
of my lip fillers and a lot of you asked
to hear about my boob job experience and
how much it costs and things like that
so basically I'm almost aground I asked
you to ask me loads of questions that
you wanted me to answer so I'm just
basically going to go through the
questions and answer them and so the
first one is how long did it take to
heal and it took around 6 weeks in total
ever to be completely healed and but I
was up and around Vince up four or five
days afterwards and I felt sort of back
to normal within that time but I'm fully
heal was around six weeks what made you
want to get one okay the reason why I
wanted to get one was because I was
quite insecure about what they look like
before and they're really really really
small when it she had like no boobs and
and I just thought that like a little
girl I didn't feel like a woman so I
just did it because I wanted to feel
more grown-up and more and womanly yeah
and did people instantly notice yes
obviously people doing instantly noticed
but I didn't go massive so I don't think
mine's a really noticeable because yeah
I only went to around a sort of D cup
now you can't pick cup sizes though you
have to pick an economy like CeCe and I
got 350 CC on top of the muscle and I've
had if you go under the muscle it's a
lot lot more painful and the recovery
process is a lot worse but I went on top
of the muscle and I had 350 CC and I'm
now sort of a d GG and they fit
perfectly within my frame and they suit
my body fine
and probably wouldn't go any bigger and
but yeah I definitely don't regret X and
I know a lot of you have asked me if I'm
great
no way in years oh ho ho it's the best
thing I've ever done and I feel so much
more confident so yeah um next question
when does the pain go away and I want to
say any pain at all I had
sir if that I'm comfortable but I even
have any pain and the reason was because
I stayed in the hospital for three days
and I had drains so they drained all the
fluid out there was much swelling when I
went home and I didn't really the only
thing that was annoying was sleeping
because you have to sleep on your back
and and I am a front sleeper I lost it
for my friends so that was a bit
annoying but I didn't have any pain I
wouldn't say it was painful just
uncomfortable and I was laid up on pain
case and things like that as well so I
didn't really have any pain at all to be
do they look fake or still look fairly
real and it's abilities I thought they
were look more fake than what they do
they did it really well they move and
like normal boobs that honestly like
normal boobs when I laid out like they
move they don't stay like one place like
this is gonna look really weird but I'm
just going to show you like they
actually move this scenarios but just
how I could show you they actually moved
like normal boobs like when I rather
like this and they're not stuck on I
wasn't going to that look I want you to
care for a natural exercise question was
and would you get anything else done no
I'm really happy with the way I am now I
wouldn't change anything else about
myself I say neither I definitely
wouldn't and how expensive was it I paid
five thousand and eighty one I went to a
proper Hospital in Cambridge called
spire and I think that was an amazing
price I had the best surgeon ever he was
amazing he is all about the natural look
so I was really really confident going
with him I had a private room I had
nurses who come after me 24/7
I stayed in for three days and they
looked after me really really well I
would say I would recommend the place to
anyone and actually one of my best
friends he's actually getting hosed on
there as well so um definitely would
recognize they do you have to get
silicones every 10 years or is it just a
rumor that is just a rumor obviously and
they are going to perform at natural
boobs so he said when I have children
they are still gonna and sort of sag
after you've had a baby so if you wanted
to get them redone then you could
obviously but so they're still basically
react like normal boobs you can still
breastfeed and all things like that and
but no that is a rumor and he said
me if they look fine after 10 years and
you don't to get the removed if they've
sort of sagged or if you feel like you
want to get them redone then yeah you
can but he said sort of 10 to 12 years
is sort of minimum you can get 20 years
out of them obviously depends on how
many children that you have so obviously
if you have loads of children and your
boobs get saggy then you're going to
want to get them redone so question what
did your parents say about it because
you are kind of young and so I am 21
years old had it done when I was 20 and
my mom was really really supportive they
weren't like over the moon about it
because it's their daughter so they just
used to say to me there's nothing wrong
with you that you don't need to get it
done like or whatever and but my mom
used to see me get really upset about it
so she was really really supportive my
dad just was really supportive we just
didn't want to know anything about it
so he came in something Hospital and
things I love but he's um just like a
normal dad that just doesn't really
wanna know about that sort of thing so
yeah and did it hurt I wouldn't say her
I wasn't in any sort of pain just
discomfort it was just uncomfortable
trying to sleep and yeah just
uncomfortable
I wouldn't say painful at all because I
was had so many painkillers and codeine
and all that sort of stuff so I wasn't
in any pain and what size were you
before and before and after pics maybe
and so I was like an a flush bake up and
I'm now a day and flash double D and I
don't have any before-and-after pictures
on for Saturday um sorry man bye tone
and heal basic normal without a bra on
can you feel this can you feel the thing
they put inside it and yes my boobs go
normal sometimes I actually genuinely
forget that I've had a boob job because
they feel so normal I member em up one
night and I was like how's they gone
they feel they're noticing you can't
feel them and you can't feel the thing
inside it a man I know
and do you recommend other girls doing
it
I think everyone's different obviously
it is good to sort of try and learn to
love yourself the way you are but if
there are things that you feel
uncomfortable and you want to change
then I think go for it I don't see any
reason why you shouldn't feel amazing in
your own skin and you sleep on your
stomach or how do you handle what with
it while sleeping so for the first two
weeks you're supposed to sleep on your
back but I after four or five days I
really really struggled I had no sleep
so I started sleeping on my side and my
surgeon it was absolutely fine as long
as I wasn't in any pain and I was
wearing like a really good sports bra
now I had it on in April and it's now
obviously October I can see from my
stomach I can sleep um completely normal
exactly how I was sleeping before I had
it done so um which is great because I
am a front sleeper so yeah and how old
was you like I said I was 20 and how did
you decide when was best to go and so my
mum I genuinely wanted to go to the
space and ethics because it was cheaper
but my mom so convinced me that if
you're going to get something done and
then it's best to go to the best
possible place so I did a lot of
research my mom helped me as well and we
found that the surgeon that went she was
one of the top three surgeons in the UK
and his name is dr. Erwin he's success
rates of like ninety eight point nine
percent or something ridiculous we
decided that that would be the best
place to go and I went to the
consultation and I felt completely
comfortable and I had a lot of trust in
him so that is why I went there
does your friends and family have boob
jobs - no no one in my family has a boob
job and only me and friends I've got a
couple of friends that had it done and
and one of my best friends is getting it
done in the next month or two
what was the pain I'm feeling like for
the first 24 hours so when I woke up
from the operation I was so drowsy I was
sick I was really ill from the
anaesthetic um I just remember being
like out of it I don't really
remember feeling anything and it was
just like I said I'm comfortable I can't
say there was any pain I'd go for it
again 100% because I had the best
experience and it doesn't scare me so I
always teardrop implants I'm booked for
one in January and don't win them to
Duke to fake he was a fat and I wasn't
actually allowed to get the teardrop
ones because my boobs are really perky
so and they say if you've got droop in
your boobs and you can have the teardrop
buns otherwise they're going to look a
bit strange so I had to go for the round
ultra high profile implant but I was
scared they were going to look really
round and said killer but he did a
really good job and they don't look
round or sexy at all so I am really
happy with them you experience any pain
on your back neck or shoulders after
having them from the weight difference
no not so they're not heavy I had quite
small implants I didn't go massive so
and no pain on my back neck or shoulders
at all and do they feel different when
you sleep on your stomach they don't
feel different at all
I forget that I have implants and I feel
completely normal and yes I can sleep on
my stomach which is great and after the
treatment was there any unexpected
changes physical animation d PS such a
stunning lady are that's likey and
unexpected changes I'd say my nipples
stretched a little bit and but now
they're in proportion my boob so I don't
remind and fat from that no no to handle
not wearing a bra with big boobs M I
don't know I wouldn't say mind a really
big and they look really big and
pictures and on camera but then when you
see me in real life they you wouldn't be
able to have had a boob job unless I
told you because they really aren't that
big at all so I don't think you would be
a when were you able to start driving
again and we left it two weeks to be
completely safe they do you say two to
three weeks and but I took two weeks off
work and then had to go back to work so
and I took two weeks but after a week I
felt absolutely fine I felt a hook and
of dry I can done anything really and
but it is better
see to do what they say and I did quite
at least two weeks what are the bad
sizes getting them done do people judge
you a lot and do you feel bad about it I
don't think there's any bad side about
getting it done and I don't really care
if people judge me I'm not bothered
whatsoever and do you feel bad about it
no way nobody is it's the best thing
I've ever done and I feel so much more
confident and yeah they provide about
the asset when I'm going for it all
again
what above me is the scarring permanent
and I already know you because you can't
really see mine anymore
and mine is nearly got completely gone
you can hardly see it and it's really
weird because it's cars only literally
like this long and I was thinking like
how did they fit an implant and a hole
like this big but mine is literally
nearly completely gone I'm wearing my
boobs have like dropped you can't see
anyway so yeah and when you first get
them done they are really high and you
have to wear like give her a strap to
push them down or they'll naturally just
drop but they aren't really like under
your chin when you first get them done
if you feel like after having them done
because you have to say invade is a new
and I would say I felt low but I was
really annoyed because I look so ugly
I've never looked I was reading pale my
eyebrows need to pluck in and it was so
funny because of all the medication that
I was taken with the pain goes I had
really bad skin and I've never had
really bad skin and one life so I was
like crying and um I had an electric bed
it's so funny Electric burn and I could
like put my feet up and things like that
and I stupidly was like messing with the
beds I was bored and I put my legs like
really high up and then my back like
really far back and I dropped the remote
and I was actually stuck in my bed like
with my knees up like this and I was
like cry like oh like I've got myself
stuck and then I couldn't ring the bell
to get the nurse come in so I tried to
sit there for like an hour
Eliza's that cry and like help me
um but yeah it was quite funny when I
think about it uh but it's how I just
like get me out of here yeah and those
are your questions there was lots of
questions but it was sort of all the
same question so I've sort of summarized
and just answered everything that I can
and by hope you guys enjoyed this video
