channel hello hi welcome if you're new
here my name is Holly Boone so today I'm
going to be doing a video using the
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory I
shadow palette from a storybook cuz my
ex um this has been out a long time but
oh you just came to beauty Bay so I
ordered it yesterday I was just like I
love China and Chocolate Factory so I
just really wanted to get the palette
and it looks good
the colors open so we're gonna try it
out see if it's worth the price okay so
the palette was 45 pounds I'm gonna show
you what it looks like so when you order
the palette it comes in this like velvet
suede little bag thing which i think is
so cute and it has story but cosmetics
on the front so you then get this little
bookmark just basically says thanks for
buying the palette so it comes in a
cardboard sleeves I'm just gonna pull
this off and this is what the palette
looks like so it looks like a book so
when you open it up you get this like
golden ticket which is really cute I
can't do I actually can't do this is
like so key but yeah so these are the
shades I was automatically drawn to the
shades cause they are so nice and this
is definitely my kind of palette and
then you've got a mirror on this side
and the eyeshadows are names like after
things and try and swapper factor easy
but like snozberries augustus Gloop I'm
pulling well so yeah this is the palette
I'm going to try out sell it let you
know what I think of it but so far I
think it's so cute
I've never actually tried anything from
this brand before I know they do a lot
of things that is they've got like a
Harry Potter one they've also got the
Mean Girls burn book which is cool but I
was really like drawn to these shades
and it's only just come to beauty base
so I can't wait to do this let me know
what look I wanted to create I just want
to kind of use as many colors as
possible so I'm gonna go for and Palombo
first which is the yellow color here on
this fluffy brush from NYX which is the
32 brush so just from dipping in their
shadow there's like a little bit of
fallout and I don't mind that I mean
it's probably gonna be quite pigmented
shadow I'm just going to tap off the
excess I'm just praying this just above
my crease yellow color so far it's
blending in really nice it's not going
on patch
quite pigmented so I'm just doing a
little bit at a time
yeah I noticed plants been out for a
while wait so you just come to meet you
Ben I was unlike beautybay knows I can't
like what's new on there I always do
that and then this was on then I was
like oh my god Alex Sookie the shadows
smell like chocolate don't you want to
eat it it smell so good so now I'm gonna
use this pink shade here which is called
Everlasting Gobstopper and I'm gonna use
my morphe brush this doesn't have a
number which is really annoying but it's
from an eye brush set I bought a while
ago I'm gonna focus this color in the
crease I feel like it's only rights like
a candy look in I love to not mean it'd
be good if there was actually one kinda
like factory that you could go there
probably is somewhere about something
like that that'd be so cool so I'm gonna
go back to my NYX fluffy brush and the
shape and pump up and I'm gonna blend up
the edge they really pigmented like I
said you only want to pick up a tiny bit
at a time and they blend in together
really nicely okay so I'm gonna go this
orange shade up here which is called
snozzberries and I'm gonna put this in
the outer corner of the eye it's a very
pigmented orange shade it's like a very
like neon color like I'm gonna put some
in the inner corner as well little bit
like a halo I think oh and this brush is
from NYX and this is a 13 brush so I'm
going to go back to that pink shade
which is Everlasting Gobstopper okay
back in the crease I don't wanna lose up
pink when you make sure you can still
see all the colors then I'm gonna go
back to and pull them poachers up the
yellow I don't think it's worth a
45-pound because the packaging the map
effort is going to the packaging is just
like unreal and the shadows are really
I wish I like the color selection as
well as palette because as you guys know
I love wearing color my eyes
that teeny green kind of looks so nice
I'm going to take my makeup revolution
concealer in the shade c5 and I'm going
to just carve out the middle of my
crease I'm going to use my Sigma a 58
brush
I don't know what color I want to put on
my lid I think I'm gonna go for fizzy
lifting drink which is like this
shimmery yellow which looks so nice so
I'm gonna use my Sigma e 58 brush
I'm gonna take the show it's not buried
and I'm gonna blend out that line we
don't want any harsh line done this a
lot of the eye
this show does green eyes it's like a
really nice lemony yellow color and it
has like a lip little bits of like
silver in it and I'm gonna go just above
that a little bit because I feel like
I'm just losing that little bit of pink
which I don't want to lose so student
lightly watch this with this so I'm
gonna do the under eye now I'm gonna go
with the yellow face which is good I'm
pulling apart on my fluffy brush and I'm
gonna go through the pink Everlasting
Gobstopper on this fluffy brush from
morphe then I'm gonna take this brush
and the orange color which is called
snozberries I'm just applying some
translucent powder on the corner because
when I clean it up
well I might apply when he is the
maybelline last in drama gel liner I'm
using my is a weaver winged liner brush
and I'm just going to apply some mascara
this is just the extreme like volume
flash with scar from Rimmel London
so I'm gonna stick my lashes on I'm
using the coco dashes in style more and
I'm using my house of lashes eyelash
glue again what's new is is so much
easier to stay calm and you've already
worn them do you not I mean like when
you've worn them in a little bit when
you put a new pair on it's like no
struggle is real so and my bottom
waterline I'm just going to take a white
eyeliner
okay so I'm gonna line my lips with my
morphe lipliner in the shade backseat
love
fires all over my lips as well just
roughly and then I'm going to take my
lipgloss from primark this is the this
was a pound and this is the perfect
shine lip gloss in stayin peachy it's
like my favorite class now mmm
how nice that looks okay lastly I'm
gonna spray my face with some of the
Mario Badescu spray to soak powder in it
so my overall thoughts on this palette
is that I absolutely love it I think so
much effort went into the package in
which I love it I love that they have
the golden ticket and then it comes in
this rhiness like an bag it's a suede
bag which is really nice yeah I just
absolutely love everything about this I
think 445 pounds it's definitely worth
the price and I love to show you this is
my kind of shades I love color and i
just think they're very nice the food
the food you get a little bit more fall
out but that's kind of the same any
palette I always find that for your
shadows have a little bit more fall out
but I don't mind about that and the
matte shades of really pigmented I love
this Keeley blue shade I can't wait to
try that they've been together really
really nicely I think the look came out
really well that's my over force or not
I really love it so I hope you guys
