youtube channel if you're new here then
please subscribe I love you forever
anyway I decided to film this a four
beat though how I'm a makeup look this
is something that I would wear to the
club I bet it's good for drinks oh let's
go up the food I would wear a test go
and do my weekly shop anyway odd way
this anytime so yeah do you bet are some
when going up just a full get ready with
me so spring of your long video so I'm
going to shut up and get go in but yes
what if i know how i got this makeup
look then please keep watching so when
I'm going out whether it be dinner club
drinks anything of that I like to go
from more like a shop round like my
daytime brow is more natural but like
when I go out when I have more like a
sharp bitch route you know I mean so I'm
gonna be using the NYX tame and frame
this is a brow pomade and this in the
show black and I'm going to use my three
one seven winged liner brush from zoeva
this brush for brows is the best thing
ever it's honestly so fun yeah I'm just
starting by underlining the brow just to
get the shape right and this this brush
is so precise and it just makes it so
sharp and clean and I know this is for
winged liner but for four hours I just I
love it so I can't even explain how many
cameras I've gone through like since
doing YouTube I've tried so much covers
I've tried sorry different lenses and
now I've gone out and got a different
camera I've got I've got the Canon a TD
I did half the 750d so I've got the
Canon a TD which is one better than 70
di thing and I've just got my standard
lens from my 750d on here because I do
like my Sigma 60 millimeter lens but I
have to have it set so far back I need
to get like home a HDMI cable and like a
screen so I can see if I'm a focus or
not because it's hard I won't have to
position the camera so far away it's
hard to know like when I'm in focus and
stuff and I also need to get an external
mic Granny's
blends because you can hear the lens
focus in and stuff you see at the start
of the project she just used a leftover
product on the brush and brush through
there and just so it's not as harsh as
the end of the brow okay so I'm going to
carve out my brow and I'm gonna use the
morphe concealer in the shade nude
because I made a mistake of using the
NARS radiant creamy concealer to carve
out my brows and my lids and then I
applied my liquid liner and it kept
transferring I was likewise acute
transferrin and it was that it was a
concealer as the base so I have to use
quite a dry base because my eyelids can
get quite oily so if you feel like your
eyeliner transfers or whatever try a
different like base because it can be
that and then like for ages I was like
voices keep transferring my my own and
another transfer and it was the exact
same eyeliner that I always use so I
knew it wasn't the eyeliner I was like
what is going on and then I realized I'd
used a different base and I was like
okay that's why so I mean if you're like
me and you do tend to get a little bit
oily on your lids or if you get really
oily then the Mac soft ochre Paint Pot
is a good one because it's quite dry so
if you do have super units I would try
that one that's really good it's really
sad I what's been going on in the world
recently not all the natural disasters
and stuff it's just like I can't even
imagine it's just so tragic and honestly
if anyone watching this is affected by
it then I'm so sorry I've been praying
through the countries I have been
donating in Stata and that can see it
I'm using the RCM a translucent powder I
love this planet so much it's just very
messy I do need to put it in a separate
container okay so I'm gonna use my Jack
and he'll play it today those of you
guys have asked me to create more looks
of it so that's what I'm gonna do she's
bringing it back so those of you went
together but you just didn't know what
looks to do so I'm gonna use it today
because there's so many shades in here
so I'm best we're gonna use this shade
right here I lost the sheet of paper
that has the names so I throw in the
names of these but I'm gonna take this
one for my transition color this brush
is just extend like fire like it's just
been for
so it is looks buttered and this is the
Sigma e35 those of you guys asked me
about like my hair routine and stuff but
honestly I don't do anything special
actually I'm like the worst person when
it comes to looking after my hair I just
use like so I do use sulfate free
shampoo conditioner I have to do because
I have extensions and I have wondered
extensions they don't you have to do
that and like honestly I don't read you
anything special right I do masks
because I really can't when you're
extension just to be careful because if
you get the conditioner on the bones or
something they just come out so I have
to just be like really mindful of that
so I don't really do any treatment I
don't really do anything special to be
honest um I should take more care of my
hair but I mean I try not to put you in
as much as possible my natural hair used
to be curly like least have really curly
hair longer and as I kind of got older I
damaged it
and I bleached it so he's had blond hair
oh it was actually no confrontive silver
like it was white so far and I ruin my
hair and then just from dyeing it I'm
just straightening it and just whatever
it just isn't actually straight now
because I've heard it that much okay so
I'm not gonna take just show you right
here again I don't know the names
because I got a sheet of paper frankly
should have pretty wrote the names like
underneath something it would have been
too much easier MBI wears it this shade
right here on my morphe m5 oh Christ
this planet is really high-quality ear
so you separate you worth the money if
you're wondering like if you want to
spend the money on it you can do a lot
of looks with this palette as all
because she's got color she's mixed
color in here she hasn't just done like
warm shades a neutral shade she's done
like some bright colors and stuff which
is nice this is what I mean about my
lighting just going in and out it's
really annoying
has anyone been watching confession
tapes on Netflix me and put her into it
I've been watching it but why do I
understand if you've been watching it is
why would you ever confess design that
you didn't do like no matter how under
pressure you are and how much I try to
force you to confess to something like
if I have a gun Saitama done something
do you know I mean sorry I'm just
cleaning my brush anyway I'm gonna take
this shade right here and I'm using my
morphe empire is sick
cuz I'm and they're like they I just
don't understand really confess
something they didn't do I've got
honestly just don't get it why would you
ever do that I would never do that
watch the police browser documentary and
honestly like America America is
up
justice system the whole police force
everything over they just man like
 up and we can play it over here
sometimes our police force just ain't
the best that they don't they're not
really like they're good but they're not
I don't know it like they're not the
better things pianist but like the
American police wasn't justice system is
initially like how can something what I
understand yeah if you haven't watched
it then you need to watch it it's just
an eye opener and especially if you're
not from America and you don't really
have much understanding of what goes on
like in like you know the priest wasn't
adjuster and stuff like you need to
watch it anyway it's like I don't
understand how somebody can go away get
away in prison for three years in
solitary confinement beaten starved
everything with absolutely no evidence
and like just because someone said they
did it like literally someone was like
he did it and then he got arrested in
which artifact there was no evidence
there was nothing and I think Chris I'm
not from America and I don't live in
that environment I don't I don't have I
didn't have much understanding of how
bad it was and then I watched that and I
was like hell man and I honestly
and then obviously he came out he's not
met in a mint like a good mental state
because of what's happened to him and
nobody would be like that's just like
normal no one would be okay after all of
that and he kind of writing that with
celebrates and stuff and they said that
his story touched and all that yeah
and then he came out and I was he was
getting interviewed and stuff and we
wanted to make a change and stuff and he
was getting interviews a friend sent on
he was on TV so people for me
area thought we had money like they
thought we had my clothes and my and
stuff so every time he would leave his
house like where he lived he'd get like
someone shot him somebody shot him for
he had money usually haven't got any
money and he got shot someone like
stashies face that people would like out
there'd be what after him he ends up in
a fight hit someone gets arrested again
then he has to get he gets told yes go
to court obviously he doesn't want to go
to court he doesn't want to go through
everything that you hadn't seen before
with the whole three is it sort of taken
violence no you didn't do and just you
know he's pretty thinking in his head
like I'm not going through that again
that I've just got through it I'm not
going through it again and then he took
his own life and honestly I just thought
like if you are celebrity and you say oh
you know you've got this money like
you've got money you've got loads of
money like move him out of that area
like move him this family away you know
it fresh start you know just help in
that sense like what I could get I had
millions of pounds and I really felt
touched one of those stories touched me
like that like I felt like wow her we
want to have this person I would do
anything I would literally offer them
everything I'd be like look I'm gonna
move you out of this situation I'm gonna
you know set you up somewhere else if
you want I can use your house whatever
and she just thinks that everybody just
want to say that they like that they
were involved but they don't actually do
much to help wanna say that's why I
think it wasn't a good environment for
him to live in after he got out of
prison I meant to stay you know so if he
genuinely cared about a person you would
have helped him he kept saying that he
wanted to go on you know when it's going
like climbing up mountains and stuff
just to like release this pain that he
was feeling and stuff like this just
built up stuff inside I mean it's like
nothing was like like I did I'm gonna
start talking right now because I'm
going on and on and on but honestly it
pissed me off watching that so what I
would do if I wanted Matt I I would just
going from that Shane on top now but
mostly I like to have a little bit
pop you not me know if you're going out
tonight if you're going out like you
when your eyes too hot so I would like
to add glitter or shimmer or full shadow
or something like that so I think today
so I'm just feeling it and I haven't
done it in a long time I'm going to use
it actual glitter so I'm going to use
this article's make its glitter glue
which I have a love-hate relationship
with because sometimes it seems my eyes
but it's like such a good glue like it
does really stand up litter and the
better I'm using is from certify and
they're really cute they come in these
little pots and the owners like size
weight fuller on - I think she's
throwing up there and then it's just
there's loads of sick stuff so I'm gonna
take something lit up on this brush I'm
just gonna press it on top I'm gonna
being already so has like different
shades of gold in it and a little bit of
Silver's in there as well
it's nice I'm just kind of pressing the
enemies in my two to six brush wounds of
evil so anyway I'm going to use this
wire so liquid liner and I love this is
waterproof minutes so Matt and I just
think it just works really well like
over sort of glitters and stuff because
when I use gels is hard to get like a
really precise line we can go a bit like
one key because of the arcs is this is a
thick layer because it this is a chunky
glitter so I'm gonna use this this liner
is really good Oh sharp tiny I was like
drives done really quickly as well so
that it doesn't transfer very quick easy
like as soon as I put it on moving up a
few seconds it's kind of already dry so
it's not as like any waiting for like
sometimes I have to knit to keep my like
that until it's completely dried down
but this one dries really quickly okay
what I always like to do on top of my
liner to make it more black is take a
black eyeshadow so I'm just going to
take the one from this Jaclyn hill
palette pressed a black shadow on top of
the liner and it really helps just one
set it in place
and this one that drives down so matte
so you don't even need to do this but it
also makes it more black like it makes
it darker lash for some reason
Roker lashes in the style of more like
when do I ever use anything else like I
know it's a name but these ones are just
bomb I always say I've started using the
House of lashes eyelash glue because I
was using to dim your lashes eyelash
glue but they just never have it in
stock he's always out of stuff on their
website so I know things discontinued it
or they don't do it anymore because
every time I'm gonna trying to order it
it's never like that
okay so lashes start on bingo so we're
gonna do face primer I'm gonna use my
fancy and beauty Primark I'm obsessed
with this I let you use it over time I
just love the way it makes my skin it
was so smooth the Beaufort's makes my
skin just feel so soft so I'm going to
apply some of the benefit Porefessional
I love this just move it up cause it's
like the best thing for sweep it up
cause in my opinion the best ever so I
like surprise in the center of my face I
just put it out and then I'll do it here
in my forehead as well okay so for my
foundation I am gonna use the Mac Studio
Fix fluid and I'm gonna mix in a bit of
my Maybelline fit me matte poreless I
love this combo mix thing I thought it's
been my favorite this would always be a
favorite of mine I've loved this
foundation for years it's like one of
the first ever foundations I fell in
love with so I've got the Mac Studio Fix
for NC 42 which is way too dark and it's
just one that's been sat in my drawer
for ages
I like to mix with the matte fit me pour
this into 20 which is a lot lighter so
this chase makes the governor's just so
much better
he's my beauty blender to blend this in
I personally prefer my Sigma sponge but
I can't find it couldn't find it so I'm
using this one but I just this sponge
absorbs so much of the product like you
have to use you just use so much more
product when you use a be blender if
you've ever tried the Sigma spotlight
you'll just know it doesn't absorb half
as much product and it's just that no
she's better I can't find one little
where it's gone I used two concealers
this is my favorite concealer situation
at the moment so it's the NARS radiant
creamy concealer and the shade ginger
mixed with the cover FX
cream concealer in the shade light so
I do use a tiny bit of this on top of
this because this gives me so much
coverage but if I use this on its own it
creases too much for me so I like the
mixture of the two so hungry I'm
literally where's the time it's two
o'clock in the afternoon of May and yet
this is a problem I have and then
obviously I'm so hungry I'll just go and
grab like some shitty food which I need
to stop doing I would raise the stuff
from women's best because I love their
whey protein I love the way whey protein
it's the best taste in what I've ever
had so I ordered some more supplements
from them coz I started getting back
into the gym and stuff once again so I
really enjoy it but I just it's hard
finding the time honestly so yeah I've
just applied the bit a bit of the cover
effects on top but I want to see that
sorry sorry about that
and B I just apply some of the comment
effects from Scott think of it some more
coverage it really does give it way more
coverage I just yeah much prefer this it
makes with this one and then for my nose
we use this morphe concealer in the
shade nude and I'm gonna bring that down
the front and on the tip like that I'm
just gonna leave that for a sec before
my cream contour I'm gonna take the NYX
this is a cream foundation and this is
in the shade rich and I'm gonna just
apply some to the forehead just under my
cheekbone and we're doing eye I'm gonna
blend it with this fancy Beauty this is
a the foundation brush but I really like
it's a bend in my cream contour I hope
you guys are settling into school by the
way it some of you have just started
school or college or whatever you're
doing and yeah I hope it's all going
well for you a few of you messaged me
about like having problems with setting
and stuff and I think it's just can be
so nasty you know if you're a
bully or if you're watching this video
and you're not very nice to people that
you need to sort out it's not cool it's
not nice like karma will get you I
promise like
people that used to be nasty to people
in school I see them now and I'm just
like calm I hit you hard you know I mean
so you just need to just like snap out
of that if you have any bit of anger or
insecurities and you take them out on
other people
you need to that's an issue that you
need to solve and just often you need to
stop being nasty to people if you see
someone that's like on their own looks a
bit lost like eating on their own like
whatever they're doing it just always
just say like Jonah come sit with me or
whatever I like just being that not
being nice you'll film your foot better
for being a nice person honestly and I
just I just find it so sad when I hear
about all these stories about people
getting bullied at school and stuff
because like I used to witness it a lot
I've got bleed I probably did not year
seven halfway free hold of you seven
halfway three or eight
I had a really goofy teeth and someone
spread rumors about me and I got bullied
fast and it was only when I started like
I flipped and I started being angry
towards people they stopped but that was
not the answer because that then was
like my issue I was an angry person if
that was an issue that I had but I just
think like it doesn't take much to be
nice to people that don't be that person
that's like being a bitch or just being
nasty like just be a kind person it just
makes you feel so much better and like I
said any issues that you have with
within yourself because I see the only
reason you're playing into someone is
because you either feel insecure about
yourself you feel threatened by that
person where you get like a power trip
out of it that's your issue you need to
solve that like you need to go find you
know you need to go talk to someone
about that because if you're a believed
honesty calm organized so just be nice
be a nice person
even if someone's horrible to you which
I should have learned just just from my
own mistakes if someone was nasty to me
I would be nasty back don't be that
person ooh but if someone's nasty to you
just I know it's really hard to not say
anything back but you're going to just
look like something it's so much of the
better person if you just ignore it and
you've just got to try and just brush it
off
honestly like kiss can be so vile and so
mean now you just kiss this your happens
in workplaces as well
our jobs there was a kid that he was
like the cutest kid ever he was like
into like Star Wars and stuff and he's a
little bit like Kiki and it was
intelligent and stuff and people just
booed him for it at work and I used to
go in on people I honestly like what the
 is wrong with you why are you
picking on it because it's funny because
it's like adults
who I like you know late 20s 30 picking
on like a 16 year old it's like come on
it's really it's actually embarrassing
it's just no need for it but people who
try and pass it off as bad of it's not
it's not bad not as the difference okay
so I just used a bit of the RCM a
translucent powder and I'm just gonna
bend in my nose
concealer I'm just using my other sponge
this video is gonna be sorry off I'm
sorry I talk a lot it takes me a long
time to do mommy I can't want to go out
so I am gonna snatch my nose less if I
could open this palette anyway so I'm
gonna take my ICMA this is a concealer
palette I'm gonna take this darkest
shade on my two to six brush and I'm
gonna snatch my nose just bring it down
the sides the only problem I find with
this cream cream din though is that they
you kind of just go to blend it and then
I just go it's like it's kind of like
just sponge kind of just themselves or
the photo and it's just kind of an egg
but you have to apply more product so
I'm gonna take my Mac mineralize
skinfinish in the shade dark deep and
I'm gonna take this big fluffy brush
from I couldn't London it I just like
looking super promised SMI pure cosmic X
cultural Diaries I really like this one
so it's really good and I'm gonna take
my Sigma F 10 brush I'm using the
darkest shade so this one my hand was
gonna chisel my cheeks a little bit more
such a perfect shade for me because it's
not too cool it's not too warm
and it blends in very nicely it looks
really good finish up the eyes so I take
that first transition car that I used on
this blocky brush gonna bring that
underneath I'm going to take this shade
which I used in the crease okay I'm now
going to take that dark shade on make
four more feet and five a six
I apply this then taking the Maybelline
gel liner and I'm gonna apply this in
this one this brush is the Sigma you
know five eyeliner brush then I'm going
to use the Mac extent of a mascara so
now I'm gonna do my highlight so just
sprayed my brush with some fix+
least get some area Badescu cucumber
spray okay I mind a bit you ran out now
and then I need to order some more every
time I've gone to order it's been out of
stock and it's only the rosewater and I
don't like the rosewater one like the
cucumber one so I'm hoping it's back in
stop and when I check after this video
anyway I'm going to use my own flat and
Nicki glow cause highlight and I'm using
the morphe m5 ten and brush did I tend
to get a bit of black on this side of
the brush where I put my brush down so
I'm just making a job using the other
side without whatever my face this
highlight is a dream though my sniff
highlight didn't exist like what the
 what I do I mean when highlight
first came like started being a thing
and people would go to Mac and get like
vanilla pigment and use it as a
highlight and it's actually really good
as a highlight that was like before
there was there glows of extreme
highlights on the market people used to
do that
it's just so good my friend Lisa turn
I'm gonna use my NYX lip liner and shape
around the NYX way tip lines if you've
not tried them are just exactly the same
as the Mac ones and there's so much
cheaper and then just this over it see
I'm just using this before my liquid
lipstick I'm going to use the dose of
colors supernatural once I've done that
I'm going to go back to the liner and
I'm going to kind of just run over it so
it doesn't mix a word okay so if you
want matte lips you can just leave it
like that sometimes I like matte
sometimes I want gloss and I'm mostly
where I'm at
just because I'm a fright then you got
to keep touching up cuz it stay but I
really want to use this glass because
I'm also severe and it's got like gosh
it's unreal this is from la splash cause
my ex and got the name on this glass but
I'll link it below anyway but it's just
unreal it's so nice yeah it's like a
gold so lastly because we want the
makeup to last all night and we're gonna
use the Urban Decay all nighter setting
spray so that is to finish makeup look I
hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial I
