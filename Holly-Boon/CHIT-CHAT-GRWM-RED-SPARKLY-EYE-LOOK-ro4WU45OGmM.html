youtube channel if you're new here and
hello my name is FUBU nice to meet you
across the internet I'm so hyper today
because I forgot having filming videos
so long and I'm just so excited like I'm
just like I can't contain my excitement
right now I'm filming anyway so today I
thought I would film a road sparkling
makeup look because it's basically
Christmas I know it's November but it's
pretty much Christmas so get around just
put it over your face
yeah and also my nails much my honor
because that's just what I do if you
don't know that you know now this is
what I do always much money on my eye
looks it's it's a thing okay i legit
have a CD about it like I cannot fit on
a purple makeup look with Redknapp no no
okay
no also my hair is short because I took
my extensions out and I'm trying to grow
out your hair so just ignore how thin
this is it's just yeah do you want to
find out how I did this makeup look then
please keep watching
make sure it's give this video a thumbs
up if you enjoy it and don't forget to
subscribe
I think the SUBSCRIBE Islands here
somewhere anyway yeah do you want to
find out how did this makeup look then
please keep watching so I just did my
eyebrows off camera I used the iconic
London sculpt and boost eyebrow cushion
if you want to find out about that
product I did do a video on it and it's
ready to go but for some reason it keeps
taking me so long to do my eyebrows on
you like to get the minivan I mean
nobody's eyebrows are symmetrical but I
look she try my best to try and get them
as symmetrical as possible it never
works out so I'm over it
anyway so I'm gonna use my NARS radiant
creamy concealer in the shade custard to
carve out my brows I feel like I
literally haven't filmed in so long I
know I already posted like five days ago
but I just buzzed it forever some reason
I think is because I went to well
holiday stuff and yeah and so I'm just
gonna use my Mac one-nine-five brush of
course I got my nails to match the
makeup look you know
I can't believe how much better I wrote
with a smaller table and I can't believe
it took me this long and wait to do it
for so long but I just was so excited
when you know I'm too much buying and I
just heard that her and stuff I spoke to
a couple people and they said it hurt so
I was like I mean I know lip filler
hurts but they said it was like a
stinging like burning pain I just kind
of put it off I'm so glad I did it cuz I
don't even it hurt that much I
think it's because now if you put so
much numbing cream on that I just didn't
really feel anything really it was like
burning a little bit but it wasn't like
as bad as what I thought it would be do
you know what I mean
also if you watch that video in the tear
trough Villa I just think it makes me
exercise more awake looks like I said
lie to you guys I don't really get much
sleep so I always look so tired and now
I feel like even if I don't have sleep I
still look more awake which is good so
I'm just pressing the concealer I just
get rid of any excess concealer I'm
gonna set that and I'm using my Beauty
bakery powder and this is the
translucent powder I've been loving this
powder at the minute it really smooth
just makes everything it's so smooth and
there's they're like no flashback at all
it's just like such a good powder he
doesn't stick which I find it's gonna
soak some powders stick and then you go
to dust it off and it's just like stays
there so I was actually gonna film like
a sparkly red wing and I cut crazy stuff
but because I've already done that I
want to clean something different I'm
still gonna use red glitter though
because that's the whole point I've got
the nails done so much that you know I
mean I finally want to incorporate some
like plums
I'm Reds and just risk missing weapons
anyway we're just gonna see what happens
so I really want to use this new morphe
39a palette which looks like this
howay looks so bomb i literally cannot
wait for this row oh just for my elbow
in the eye shadow foxy
fill up my nose at Dorothy shoes from
Wizard of Oz I'm living oh good job I
kept the plastic sheet you know me I
won't lose these plastic sheets have the
names on and I'm never known the name of
the shadows so for once I haven't lost
the sheet so I think the first color I'm
going to use is
canvas wall which is this one right here
it's called canvas I'm going to use this
in my transition color and I'm using
this NYX fluffy brush it's just got
number 32 written on it so I'm just
gonna apply this for my transition color
I wish you went to Tenerife last week if
you follow me on Instagram and snapchat
and it was so hot it was like 24 degrees
every day sometimes had go up to like 26
27 and I wish to say live it and I was
like yeah it's Han no but I am happy
that it's cold now it's coming to
Christmas because I think Christmas will
be Christmas if it wasn't cold you know
what I mean oh god yes basically I took
my extensions out my bonded extensions
because I wanna now is kind of when our
I just want to grow my hair ready for
someone and I want to get it thick and
stuff because it's gone really thin okay
it's then I want to go for this orange
shade which is this one right here okay
that color is called vivid so I'm gonna
use that color in the crease
I'm gonna go from orange to red to like
a plum and then put the red glare on I
put in my hair design how it's gonna
look what we're gonna see anyway so I'm
gonna just apply this in the crease also
see this game eyelashes permed I think I
look so much better
I didn't even know you could do that I
didn't even know that was a thing and
then I was speaking to some lady about
my eyelashes she was like she's just
getting a parent you're probably not
sure if you think and I was like oh my
god such good idea especially when I put
false lashes on I think they blend a lot
better now cuz my eye she's easy to just
stick out like that these shadows are
really nice I love this palette so far
the shades seem really nice the other
one I used on holiday what was it the
35d it's a new one I used it on holiday
and I'm looking I'm not a fan I just
found the shades just every time I blend
them they just disappear and they just
weren't as pigmented I don't know why
that is because I do fire sometimes in
morphe plates they're not always
consistent you know I mean like some
pets I've had that I have but really
good shades in there
and a really pigmented and good and
stuff and then
in like another pallet they'll be like
song logo and some just not good I don't
know I don't know why there is yeah this
one seems really good like that's that
looks really nice it's blended together
really nicely okay so I'm gonna take my
satify the tropical Wonders palette you
know how if everybody's on their slide
with all these shades please so bright I
can't I can't though so I'm gonna take
the shade of red to see which is this
really bright red shade here and I'm
gonna apply that to the outer corner in
the crease and to the inner corner as
well and then we're gonna blend that see
how brother is oh my god
with these shadows in this palette I
prefer to Pat Pat them rather than Rob
you just get women'll pigment this brush
is the Sigma e30 2 then I'm gonna take
this brush which just might have my
transition color on it I'm gonna blend
the edge really really really like
do you feel like I've lost that orange
shade of it so I'm gonna just apply some
more of that I know I hug you
Wow see I wanna kind of makes a little
bit more plum and the outer corner and
the inner corner just want to add
another color otherwise it's kind of
just all right at the my run I think we
go for this dark one here
how annoying is it were like one eye
looks different as they are so I'm now
going to take my NARS radiant creamy
concealer in is the shade custard
I don't crazy right now and I'm gonna
just carve out the middle of the eye the
center of the iris we're just gonna find
the glitter in the middle
now for the fun part the glitter so I'm
going to take my Asha cosmetics a
glitter glue sticks like this and I'm
gonna just apply that on that bit where
I've tried the concealer that's where
we're gonna put it up do the same on
this side so I'm gonna use this red
glitter from ash because my ex so I'm
gonna just put some in the lid and then
I'm gonna use my there's a weaver two to
three brush to apply this yes
so I've got blue in my eyes and I can
see it's glitter oh I like it
okay I'm just gonna wipe all of this
excess click on I'll hold my face just
using a makeup wipe okay so we're gonna
do luscious but first I'm gonna line my
lashline
so I'm going to use the wire so liquid
eyeliner so just line my lashline before
I put lashes on it applies the mascara
I'm just using my Mac extended play luck
always show what I think I want to do is
I'm gonna use some of this silver
glitter and I'm gonna just do a line
where at the top of that glitter see
what it's like
why have I done that in my head it
looked good in my head but now I'm just
like why okay I need to get rid of that
cuz I've redone a why did that I've
redone I what I might do instead is add
some of this silver in with the in with
the red yeah I mean I just got some
silver in there okay that looks better
note to self when something looks good
don't try and do something let's just
leave it alone okay I do think it looks
better I've added the little silver bits
in it because I was it did look a bit
flower and now it's kind of just lining
up a little bit more so we do actually
like that understanding why I put it all
like no I didn't want it done so I'm
gonna use my Koko lashes and start or
more which is what air which is I feel
like when you find your perfect eyelash
you just use the same ones don't you
like the time you just don't can't be
asked to try new ones that just me so
I'm going to use my house of lashes
eyelash glue and I'm just gonna apply
some to the lashes and leave them to dry
for a little bit before sticking them on
so my primer I'm gonna use the fenty
Beauty profile primer I love this and
will use the foundation I think it works
really well with the foundation the
foundation is my favorite at the moment
like literally I can't even explain how
much I love it I've been so early and
it's just been the best foundation for
me you McGrath let me dry skin I don't
know if you're gonna like it as much
just because it does dry down fairly
matte just say I don't know if you are
gonna like it as much I'm just applying
it with this kabuki brush from Sigma
yeah but this primer just makes my skin
feel so like baby smooth and just worked
so good with the with the foundation see
I'm using the foundation
shaking it I used the shade 300 I'm
gonna put some in the back of my hand
and I'm using this little small kabuki
brush from Mac which is the 130 brush
and I'm gonna first we'll just
stipple it on the face
I always do like one part of my face
it's fine with this foundation because
it just dried out quite fast so I just
had to do it bit by bit
see how it's different like that it
looks messy obviously you can see where
the brushstrokes and then I take my
sponge and just go over it but with the
brush I feel like it just disperses the
product really evenly that's why I like
to use the brush as well I put my
picture on for uh there was no edit and
I feel or nothing and I just showed you
what you look like on flash
it looks so bomb so if you want to see
what this looks like on flash also with
that beauty bakery powder I get no
flashback and go check out my Twitter I
tweeted it the other day or beyond my
media for my media on Twitter I'll be in
there but yeah here's a picture of the
this foundation with that powder as well
with flash and it looked so good my face
ik so flat imagine if you just did
foundation you do consider and stuff
like you did like a moon the moon emoji
and so I'm using the NARS radiant creamy
concealer in the shade ginger
this one's darkness egg custard because
I like a bright under eye but not too
bright
I'm just gonna apply some here under me
further ed I'm gonna who's excited for
almost every I cannot wait it's like my
favorite program of the whole year I
love that I lips you can't wait I'm
gonna leave this to dry dynamics I want
a bit of extra coverage so what I do
that I am gonna just use this iconic
London pigments is taking the shade 4.1
only a tiny bit of this just to warm up
a little tiny bit and then I'm using the
same brush I used to apply the
foundation just buff this in and then I
to go over it with the sponge again
who's been watching X Factor and who's
your favorite if you've been watching it
click below who your favorite from X
Factor is my favorite is Ray oh I cannot
believe she is 16 years old I love her
just so cool wait I love her I always
say like racks ooh I think they're
really cool and they're quite current
and do you like them okay then I'm gonna
blend in the concealer with the beauty
blender yeah comment below your favorite
person for me inspector
I really I'll be honest I don't
understand why Louie Walsh judges X
Factor I don't get it
he I thought like he doesn't even know
what he's talking about do you know what
I mean like we listen to him talk you're
like really all he says it is you look
like a pop star you're saying like a pop
star
they're gonna be a pop star okay I can't
do an Irish accent
he gives people I gives his acts like
the wire songs he's like he wants to
stitch them up or something okay so I'm
gonna use my Beauty bakery translucent
powder which I've been running and
raving about all of that I think is
better than the icy weather because is
it it just moves that my under a lot
more as you can see that kind of smooth
that side notice compared to that
outside do you know what I mean it
really smooths out the under on whereas
not the translucent powder from rcml it
sets my makeup waiters re smooth wonder
as much show me you've got since me and
I was like oh every night relics I think
I'd send someone else he's it's brown
football a car member who I remember
thinking that it's really good and I'm
okay with sense me so I'm really
grateful thank you I love it oh my god
my ashes
I wish forget about this quick
signal on glue dry this glue is still a
bit wet so I'm gonna leave that alone as
you can see a little bit it's a gray
still showing but it will dry then it'll
go clear so we're gonna finish up the
under eye before I do the rest of the
face and what a fast we'll use that
transition color which was this one
right here investable using canvas under
the eye
this isn't gonna be much of a halo eye
now because I mean I should have done my
face and then brought all the way around
and around it
I know it's kind of more sharp but I'm
okay with that
it's fine okay so then I'm gonna go to
this orange shade this shade right here
that orange shade is called vivid this
has got a bit of red on this brush as
well did bring it down too far so I'm
just cleaning that up so then I'm going
to take this red shade from the
certified palette
and I'm gonna take that plum shade from
the multi palette which is called
forever
and I'm just gonna put it on the outer
corner this time not bringing up move it
across no I'm gonna put some glitter
just under here I want to take my ash
cosmetics glitter glue and I'm just
gonna it's just in the center of the eye
yeah you really want to try not to get
this in the lashes
and he's gonna do like a little
upside-down triangle and then I'm going
to take the red glitter with this brush
this is the 2t3 zueva just press some of
that on my glam crystals does in gel
liner in the silver shade I'm gonna
apply some silver in there as well I'm
just gonna do it basically ooh I love
that I'm just gonna apply some mascara
mascara cycle and then to my bottom
lashes as well I like how she's done and
I'm absolutely obsessed I'm gonna take
my Mac Studio Fix powder NC 43 and I'm
gonna set the rest of my face I mean you
don't really need to do this with this
foundation but I still get oily through
this foundation for out the day because
I'm just an oily bitch so I do set it as
well but I mean most people you won't
even need to set the foundation now I'm
gonna set my mac mineralize skinfinish
in the shade dark date and I'm gonna
just go over where I applied that cream
stick to warm up a little bit
and then I am gonna contour a little bit
and winter my pur cosmetics contour
Diaries and was hit this dark shade and
this brush is from morphe I don't know
these of launch jet these are they're
like sparkly brushes I think they're for
like Christmas but I don't know for sure
but they've got sent to me with that
palette so I found they would have to
watch by now and just make it just have
a look on the morphe website i feel like
they would have george went out also
more Fiat I launched in the UK finally I
think they've gotten mine UK website now
if they do only the stuff below I'm on
the UK website I'm just gonna neaten up
that once it my beauty bakery
translucent powered on just baked under
there for a sec so I'm just gonna spray
my brush with some of the Mario Badescu
cucumber spray and the highlight I'm
using is the Nikki churros ever glow
highlight so it's got these three shows
I'm going to just do a mixture of these
two
and we're going to price the inner
corner and the brow bone I don't get a
corner highlight just makes so much
difference and then we're going to do
the brow I mean I could be really
over-the-top into a red lip I think
that's gonna be too much so I'm
definitely gonna go for just a nude
okay I'm gonna use this nude from dose
of colors it's in the shade let's cuddle
I love this this is so nice it's a very
peachy nude I love it okay I cannot find
the right liner so I'm just gonna I'm
just gonna go with this without a liner
to erase if it's it a matte liquid
lipstick you don't really line it
because it won't bleed
okay and now I'm talking about I'm gonna
apply little bit of glass I'm gonna use
the Madeline gloss right across from NYX
and I'm just apply this in the center
and then I'm just gonna spray on my
Mario Badescu cucumber and green pea
spray I love this so that is the
finished look I hope you guys enjoyed
