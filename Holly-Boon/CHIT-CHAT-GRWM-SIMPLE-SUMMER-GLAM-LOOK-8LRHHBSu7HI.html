ready with me today
I've actually what I want to do I have
no idea what if and when I create itself
just initially got all of my makeup
everywhere musically do a little get
ready so they'll get ready with me yeah
let's just crack on and shut up I feel
like I have a film for ages even though
half but I systems ever I even though
hasn't already tan that's real nice and
brown just in a way it's been so nice it
should you look online we had the best
time I while I was like I don't come
over I didn't miss filming obviously I
love filming so much so I literally
can't wait to some video and so I'm
using the anasazi up beverly hills
dipbrow pomade come back to using this
and i you show chocolate or you should
trace dark brown and i might see much
difference in racism savonius chakra
system see a little bit more warm
I need likes its slightest amount so I
mean I don't receive too much different
this was in chocolate and you still
doesn't let that warm to this so you
know this brush is the whim liner brush
way zoeva I find this really really easy
to use for your eyebrows CEO in your
brush whatever use when I do my brows up
this is so good I'm taking out that you
guys loved our get ready with me with me
and Imogen I love Imogen so much is that
you only the nicest people are the
nicest kindest guys I've ever met in my
life
I mean how just get on so well like you
know you just like vibe with someone
from the get-go like when I first met
has like she's my type of girl like she
is someone I'll with so we've been
like hanging out ever since and we just
become really close and we just have
subtly last year but all the time at
whenever I'm with that I love so much
if you love so much they spin said it
was a nice different video everyone has
their growing her channel because she
deserves she deserves a lot of success
she's such a sweetheart when I do the
front of my brow identified tomorrow but
she did tiny bit and then I just did she
brush through a little bit as I went to
be too harsh and yeah if anyone got any
holidays time this way where are you off
to
since I come back from that little trip
with Todd I want to go somewhere else
because we're in here for a few days
because he can get the days of work you
can get up a wig of work so we get to go
for too long but I had the best time
when I got there so glad I've already
hurt you a little bit my nose a little
bit my name is are is burns in the sun i
think it's when wearing mirrored
sunglasses you know i love marathon
glasses like mirrors aviator huge
fuck-off sunglasses like big ones cover
half your face I live for them except
you don't have to wear makeup until I
talk to a makeup in the day and I can
look like underneath rid of the
man because I've got some bows on and
then I which consider to you I don't
deserve three enemies I'm really tired I
don't have a concealer darker for my
concealers are quite light to light
sometimes putting a little bit town so I
mean I'm always pounds but I can get
away a bit a bit more when my actual
places in that round right now I can so
I think moving variable which ones like
this and stuff
I'm going to use my tart shape tape to
carve out me brown some of this
concealer I feel lucky doesn't work with
all foundations though if I use it with
a stick of a cream foundation kind of
separates on the skin it isn't really
work that well but I don't know why I no
idea why they just yeah it just doesn't
work very well with them stick cream
foundations works really good with
liquid foundations because of some
reason I use it with a cream because
thick or cremation just doesn't work
from it this brush is Sigma concealer
brush F 75
so whatever use is Sigma brushes I can't
house the guys on the issue of stresses
Emily there's such an investment they
were last two years I look crazy right
now I look crazy my precision flat angle
brush and I always put some families and
rather on this brush and just press it
and when I just save them I can see
though just set that makes it easy to
blend your eyeshadows above that who
said I heard so many people crammed I'm
a video that you need to stop swearing
no I don't like like why do I need to
stop swearing and that's me
I it's lower along just around so I'm
not much shade or potentially some miles
on camera and there's no rule that says
you have to watch me like there's plenty
of other youtubers you can go watch if
you don't want to watch me finally
that's why you know just keep it moving
it's cool I'm not really asleep
thank you all right but yeah I only too
much my eyes so let's take my chocolate
palette by toothpaste
I'm going to take my paper blending
brush by Sigma is the e boy I'm going to
take shade hazelnut just show you right
here I actually like many more looks at
those nice I didn't realize that being
tickled like you know when you get your
article that I'm more like talking to my
arms and my now you see the adrenals
little liked if your honor I love that
so much so this is what was on my own
time not having such a rare day I wish
you have like blazes it orbits and hair
poking up because I stupidly you don't
when I wanna dig so I'm not much of an
idiot so I didn't have a home to get my
part in so come in a park a straight
winter file so I decided to use no joke
scissors like the end of a scissors like
I could use my tweezers like this but I
like to use scissors to do that and it
caught my hair obviously and now I have
little bits of hair
ok so that's one we do I think that's
all I'm going to do really and I'm just
going to bring a little bit of that
color called semies okay wait the color
I just used was not good hazel I was
called salted-caramel
sorry I lied and then I'm going to go
with a little bit or
while we're doing this and then I'm
going to go with milk chocolate on the
same brush I'm just going to put a
little bit in the crease is anyone going
to any festivals this year if so where
are you going and it won't go to any
like UK festivals to be honest but I'm
not really that much of a fun okay so
that's what I'm going to do for this
crease because magazine on due to March
and then I'm going to just I've been
using this for well over my lid later
where's it gone facility no concealer
I've been using this from Mac this
little pot here is called the difficult
paints Mac paints this little pot here
and this is in shade sublime nature
anyway i'm i've been using this all over
my lid and everything i can see it out i
prefer the color of it and i just think
it works better so i'm just going to
apply some of this on the head using
this brush this is the yeah liquid
concealer smooth thick you like your
shadow base and and i don't like the
soft ochre Paint Pot like I read and I
could put it dries up my eyes so I
stopped using that ages ago I just like
flaky and dry and see how using this and
I really like this one up really good so
good a groove in NASH cosmetics
just going to whack some this in the lid
and I'm going to try to stick my loose
shimmer and I'm using the Sigma F 70
brush to apply this which she plays all
over my lid cute then go back in this
for the crease so I'm going to put some
mascara real quick and this is the
ar-rooh mascara by benefit okay so these
lashes I've actually never tried these
eyelashes before and from our brushes
and they're called the norfair or you
like so yeah the first I'll actually
easy source as well it really Wilma
see ya anyway okay so do you ever get
that bit where your eyelashes you've put
a little bit of gap there where you can
see where you slept with Usher I'm going
to show you how to get rid of that
because that is usually there was
annoying thing ever so I'm gonna
take my small eyeliner brush from Sigma
shop e 10 and I'm going to take my
signature line huh just going to put it
of this on the brush and then what I do
is you just want to run your brush with
this gel liner in your top waterline
also in between your top waterline and
your lash line it's like a little gap
there you really get in the cabinet
space up in the ILA
you won't have that little gap which is
always really red I also say can't do a
lot and image is like how you put me
saying on time well what sorry because
we never have spent too much on skin we
started to looking like each other
Iowa Satan things that she mamrie says
so funny I'm like work on television and
I show up to a brick magic cream love
this sit closer
so no actually have a foundation touch
my face and I wrote because my skin it's
time for a day so the nearest thing I
have is the studio fix fluid put my mac
n NC 42 grand William oyster eyes all in
the hair love that I'm going to spray my
face and fix+
as well yeah this is definitely not much
actual still she light as understand
it's not so much if we're actually high
like this area but my foreheads up very
well another thing for us doesn't have a
key staff of concealer
so easily is so light make this work
I'll make it work oh oh yeah everyone's
always asking where I got my top shape
time in the UK yeah she's on QVC online
and that's where I get my advice
it's really because it's sort of a
mentor but it will definitely last you a
while you get a lot of product but it's
like this very big so definitely nice
day long time with a set that taking the
different sponge same is funny for a
different one I will choose one for
cream ones powder and we're taking my RC
Manor color powder
okay then I'm going to go with while so
just leave that bacon winnowed a little
bit I'm going to take my mineralized
skinfinish and dark deep from muck on my
mac 135 someone like the professor just
Pat the floor are travelling Rob because
sometimes you can disturb the foundation
is up underneath and they can go a
little bit patchy
so sometimes it's better just to come
Pat the product on instead I'm just
going over slightly lightly where I did
apply concealer because I see is what
you like so I'm just not putting any
extra product on the brush but just
going over that bit journey I decided to
get dark deep because they're giving me
some was a little bit too like other way
around so I've got dark deep which is a
little bit more ready for Alan and put
see a bit dark as well so yeah I'm just
going to press it I'm going to go under
my eye but just gently
silly little bit because I don't move my
under eyes be so bright some when it's
natural my nose I'm going to take my
Sigma firm shader this c57 and I'm going
to take this shade from makeup geek
which is called half hide is a contour

go down there again and again on it I'm
going to do a little bit of contouring
I'm going to use the shading light
palette again I'm going to take that

and then again next going my bronze are
just going to tap in like the top
toughen that over the top of where
either side contour just to make sure
that it's not hot
okay okay okay okay so I'm going to go
to a brush now and I'm going to take
this from benefit for up blaster how
beautiful it's so pretty
it's like a little bit of shimmer it's
not really America it doesn't look
shimmery on the skin it just kind of
looks nice and glowy and it smells

actually going to take someone write

my 3d blender by Sigma and I some of
these the glow is rare and then we'll
find some eyebrow okay so I'm so excited
to use this this is the IFRIC with my ex

excited it's charity to share and I send
everyone using it you sit somewhere else
so I've put my iPhone abundant
illuminated drops on as you can see and
then I want to go for it with this
highlight so I'm just going to take my
cheek bone highlight brush by Sigma and
I'm going to spray some six love this
brush very quick you're a bit my face as
well and then I'm going to take this
lighter shade in this gold sure and when
I mix these two shades together
I'm so excited like I need to go away
but it's going to be very intense
oh my god I wasn't expecting anything
less from Nikki though and to be hella
bright value is that I guess I'm liquid
everywhere I went here and a brushing up
on there there we go okay
I also said that that is just insane and
applause - Nikita Torrio's when does she
ever not say my life anyway and I
because my ex obviously okay so I'm
going to finish up my eye makeup I'm
going to take this e30 pencil brush by
Sigma and best of all going with that
shade salted caramel and we're on the
underwear and then I'm going to go in
with shade milk chocolate and do you
think that the same but cute is closer
to the lash line in my waterline I'm
going to go for white eyeliner I'll just
make my eyes pop in the summer either
going to summer I tend to go for more
light on the eyes rather than dark smoky
black liner I tend to get a white liner
so I'm taking the white liner by Mac
this is called fascinating it's just a
pure white I call and I'm going to run
that my limit applies to describe to my
bottom lashes I'm going to take my sigma
e rho v and really take some of that
light shade and this and i'm going to
highlight my inner corner of my eye
I just found this color and I'm obsessed
of it this is one of the Marc Jacobs
this is a lick liquid lip cream so it's
not matte it's not matte liquid lip it's
a cream and it is in shade fall over me
and I'll show you it's literally easy
for I am obsessed with this color rush
you just go in the middle with shade
yours to try okay so that is the
finished look it's just nice fresh
looking makeup look for somewhere really
easy to do and yeah probably my makeups
really simple we have to be amazing that
make up to us to this eyelet and then
yeah just super glowy bronzy and this
lip color offset you could pair this
with a bold lip if you wanted to you
could go for a bright coral or read
anything bright clean or if you want you
to do it because the eye makeup is
really subtle so you can get away with
it get away with it but I actually
prefer it with this lip I hope you guys
