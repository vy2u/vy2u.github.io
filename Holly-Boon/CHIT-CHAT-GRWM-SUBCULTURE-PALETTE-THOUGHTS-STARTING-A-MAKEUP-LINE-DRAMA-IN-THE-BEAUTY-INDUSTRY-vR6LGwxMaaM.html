get ready with me chitchat getting ready
with me I pretty much talk for hour
every single sheet or anyway but today
I'm just really gonna talk to you guys
about the ladies of random shit and also
I did put on Twitter to ask me questions
that you weren't a nice so I'm gonna
answer them while I do my makeup so yeah
and also I'm actually gonna do my I rise
in this video today I'd never been or me
to do them in the video because it takes
me so long to do them but I want to do
them today so you guys can see how I do
them I'm gonna use the brow from benefit
from my eyebrows today in the show 5 so
yeah like what have you guys been up to
anyone got any exciting plans any
holidays weddings anything like that I
literally feel like where the hell is
some poeple it is if you're from the UK
what is going on it's been like bringing
in a miserable for like the last pretty
much the whole of July fright the first
week of July we had good weather and
then apart from nicest appreciate so
it's pissing me off like bad I'm like I
need to have a holiday I can't deal with
this I have do two different types of
eyebrows that I do and when I'm doing
like a full beat I like more of a bitch
broom what a shot as fuck bitch bro but
that's one new today but sometimes I do
like more of a natural brow so I'll use
the benefit precisely my brow pencil or
I'll use the NYX brow pen sorry like
that also I do use the elf cuz my ex and
eyebrow a cream I really like that as
well as well as this so I just kind of
switch between them or really how
annoying is it by the way when you
decide to curl your hair and then like
you don't like it and then you want to
straighten over it but just like wait
straightener but at least you happen to
me today I combed my hair then I was
like oh my god no I hate it and then I
had to try to straighten straighten over
it and now it's all kind of like
flicking out and stuff so yeah I've got
some questions I'm gonna go for it onto
our images yeah
why are you such an amazing boss ass
baby girl I love her how often do you
have know me
five days chibi on it yes it depends
like some day some weeks I've like a
couple of days no makeup then some weeks
I have like three or four days no makeup
it spreads on my skin being honest
eyebrow snatch yes okay do you see you
Todd get marry and have a family
I do definitely I mean we've not even
been together a year yeah I'll be a year
September but I just feel like when you
know like you know you're not in it he's
just so caring so for fall he looks
after me he so loyal I just it's hard to
find genuine nice people at that as well
and he comes from just like the most
amazing family as well and I just don't
I don't know I as long as it keeps going
how it's going I feel like copy them
forever but you know emitted when when
we find out more about your snapchats
the other day guys I always tell you
guys I'm working on things and I am
alright I'm gonna have my own makeup
line that is a fact I've been saying
that for so long
that is gonna be something I'm gonna
have it's always been a dream of mine
and I just it's gonna happen regardless
I'm gonna make it happen but it's really
annoying for me because I always want to
get you involved because I want your
opinion on things like you guys aren't
my friends I I want to ask you like do
you like this do you like that like I
want you guys to have an input on the
whole entire thing but and then I also
want it to be a surprise so it's really
difficult for me and to get the balance
right but I'm working on things and I
can't say when things are gonna launch
or whatever anything that because I
literally I'm so feisty so it's going
backwards and forth with labs and shit
and it's like it's a long process and
obviously but I'm doing everything
myself like everything I'm doing myself
so it's a lot of work but it will happen
and I can't say when but it will happen
and yeah like I said it's annoying
because I just want you guys have so
much input I really want to ask you like
because obviously as much as I want it
to be process that I love I also want
you to love them as well so I just want
like
so much input from unit but then I also
want it to be a surprise day it's really
hard it's really hard to get the balance
right it's hard to know what to do
really in that sense I'm just like what
do I do
do I ask them what do I keep it a secret
or what do I do
somebody I can see like for maybe in the
shade and neutralize cover up my brows
favorite subject in school that's hard
because I left school like years ago
pingali of school in 2010 seven years
ago I was a very ordinary nine school I
hate it so I mean favorite subject my
favorite subject is probably textiles
and I just like designing things like
designing clothes and like you know I
know you've got to make clothes and I
made like children's clothes somebody's
little dress for his little girl like
age 4 to 5 and I just loved that I loved
like designing clothes and stuff like
that was fun as much his school is
really really important and you needs to
listen you need to learn you need to all
that stuff but you really do need to you
need to learn stuff well um yeah it's
super important but on the other side
it's like don't let it define you
because you are capable of doing
anything you put your mind to
all right just don't ever let your you
know how intelligent you want to find
you are because anything is possible and
I promise you that you can still do what
you want to do teachers that will find
something you're passionate about learn
about everything to do with that that
host object educate yourself in
something that you are passionate about
someone would have said to me well it
like years ago that I would be doing
something that I absolutely love is like
a career in a job and you know I have
all these opportunities I would laughter
but no I wish is really like casino for
my eyes because my shadow base because
then it makes the colors stand out more
and make the clothes more vibrant so if
you're wondering why I've got like
ridiculously white concealer on my
eyelid
that is the reason what's it like being
on company's PR lists it's really
actually it's really nice to feel like
they appreciate your work and that they
want you to kind of you know they want
to keep you involved with what they're
doing I just think it's very rewarding
being it's really nice to know that your
work gets no yes if that makes sense
and but in the same aspect it's like I
had this conversation over then it's
like people always say like I won't
always be honest about for us and if
that means me getting taken off a pilot
and that's what it means I care more
about you guys only about the artists
and if yeah if being completely honest
about a product and having your own
opinion on a product gets you removed
from with the artists and that's just
how it is
that's how it's gonna be I'll just get
removed I don't care you know I mean I
always want to keep it 100 and I always
keep it 100 and I said that is and a lot
of people were like about the subculture
pipe as Ian gotta move it I don't if
there's dodgy patches I don't know about
that and some people are saying like
there's a lot of dodgy batches have gone
out or whatever and I am one Anastacio
stylist and I got one in Fiat and mine
my palate was really not gray and it
wasn't even just to fall out there was a
lot of fall out but it wasn't even just
that because obviously to get that much
pigment it's gonna you're gonna have
fallout but it was the fact that it was
so hard to blend today's and I don't
know if it's the choice of colors and
that made it difficult to blend them
together
I don't Reno but I really struggled to
blend the shadows they were separating
on my eyelids I don't know I just I just
feel like maybe I've got a dodgy
you know I wondered Yi palette or
whatever but that was my opinion people
took it how they wanted some people said
thanks for the honesty of people were
like saying I was like I don't know just
being like extra and I but that was my
opinion so that's just how it is I think
no matter what in this industry you get
you get literally criticized for
absolutely everything that you doing
that you say and sometimes it's like I
don't know I don't let it bother me
because at the end
if I'm being 100% true to myself 100
entries you lot people don't like it
they can fuck off I really don't care
I'm not here to please everyone I'm not
people pleaser so if you don't know I'm
getting popped you know I mean it but
yeah like I said I always be honest so
if I don't like something I'll always
say either way I'm using the morphe 35 P
palette
what did you Purple's in my eyes today
cuz I'm wearing purple and I've got a
purple backdrop so I thought I'd be keen
how do you motivate yourself to get
where you want to be and I am quite a
driven person I set my mind on something
and then I have to do it I have to get
it I have to get there I'm very like
driven and I will do anything do you
ever wanna get and I always have dreams
and stuff and I just think I just think
life's too short you've got to throw
yourself into things you've got to take
risks you've just got to be that person
because life is social you don't
everyone I don't everyone I look back in
my life and be like what if I did that
or what if I did that differently I
always just do it if it goes wrong then
I've least I've tried do you not I mean
that's just the kind of mindset that huh
I just yeah we just go for things and
I'm just very driven so motivation is
kind of easy for me in that sense
because I just know what I want and I
won't stop until I got it is it hard to
be in a British blogger who hasn't got a
stereotypical posh accent no it's most
popular YouTube are posh because it
sells better and I've never really
noticed that I don't really know to be
honest I don't really do it to kind of
like I don't really do you to be like a
tactical way if that makes sense I could
only think to myself why need to have a
flush like sinks I don't get more views
it's not about that for me it's just
like me putting myself out there who I
am and if people like it they like it if
they don't they don't um I've never kind
of seen it as then like I need to be the
certain person I mean I've got 350,000
of you and I never even dreamed I'd have
that many subscribers so I mean that's
crazy to me where's your main goal in
life
my main goal in life is just to be a
hundred percent happy and to never have
money worries as much your goals in life
and I want to give back to my parents
and I want to make sure that everybody
in my life that I care about is
completely 100% comfortable with money
and never has to worry that's something
that I always say to myself that I'll
work so hard that I work as hard as I
have to do to make sure that everyone
that I care about in my life you never
have to worry about money money is a big
worry in a lot of people's lives and a
lot of people I care about lives and I
just want to make sure for them that
they never have to have that worry
anyone they can ditch you just go and
live their life and that's something I
always wanted to do but yeah it's not
what about money but I just want to take
that worry away from the people that I
care about if you're trying to bring out
your own makeup line what product would
you be the first to start working on
it's hard because budgets certain things
cost more certain things take longer
it really just I don't know it's one of
them it's kind of like I want to bring
out everything that I possibly can
but you have to start small how old are
you when you first started wearing
getting this makeup so when I first
started reading makeup I was probably
about 14 1914 when I first started
wearing it those were the days when
everyone used to pray dream up mace on
their lips and put lip gloss on top and
let you wear so much mascara that your
eyelashes looked like spider that's why
I was like Mac there's no such thing as
highlighter there was no such thing as
contour I was never a thing it was like
yeah makeup wasn't anything like it is
now is that anything you want people to
know about you I throw you guys know
everything about me I'm such an open
book I don't hide anything all right if
you ask me anything I'll tell you pretty
much everything there are some things
obviously I keep private for obvious
reasons but I am so open make sure you
tell you anything I thought you guys my
friends where do you see yourself in 10
years love you boo and ezel as you know
how funny it is me and Imogen get like
videos of you guys all the time
and diesel and it just makes me die it's
so funny I live for it why do I see
myself in ten years it's hard to say she
really got to say ten years um I think I
want to have a family by then Oh Carly
I'm 23 now so yeah I've definitely have
a family by then hopefully my makeup
brands me to take over the world this
video is gonna be on our lawns I'm gonna
go to edit and be like oh my god it's so
low you're a real time right now this is
how long it takes me how not to give a
fuck that's something that I feel is
within yourself and I kind of just woke
up one day and was like fuck this and I
care like I know sounds really weird but
I kind of live in my own little bubble
like I just share myself with people
that I love and feel like I care about
my my business stay in my lane and then
I'm happy like the happiest person I
could be so I don't let negativity
affect me I don't even read into it I
don't even think think about it I don't
care do you I mean I feel like at this
point at how many how long I've been
doing YouTube I plant every single
insult you could ever imagine and I just
feel like I don't care anymore when I
first started it was hard because I used
to get so angry and I'd get so annoyed
that people would think you know people
would say things about me and I but they
don't know me like I'm not like that
I need to get really I was really
sensitive about it but no I'm just
having a fucking movie like no no you
have to just teach yourself not to care
and it's it can be so hard I like the
not easy thing but you have to teach
yourself not to care because you have to
look at the bigger picture you have to
realize that you have so many people in
your life that care about your not being
there the only people you should be
focusing on solidfire's just starting to
be eternal I'm a lover of makeup but the
competition is crazy you can't look at
the competition because it's not a
competition there's so much room for
everyone I think that's
a lot of what a lot of people see it as
they thought they're in competition with
people and it's not like that like
there's only one of you in the world one
of you so your original in yourself so
diamond let the fall of being like the
talent is you know high and there's
competition and a lot of stuff because
really I mean you could be the best make
whites in the world but if you've got no
personality then I went watch a YouTube
channel simple as I love to watch people
with Phillip personality and funny and
just loving and just a happy and I love
watching positive people I just with big
personalities that's just type of that I
like to watch I don't care how good you
out make up you could be like like I
said you could be the best make requests
in a well but if you first not use dryer
then guess what I'm not gonna watch you
I don't know I just think don't you see
it as a competition because you are what
you know in yourself there's anyone of
you welcome your makeup if makeups what
you want to do practice and practice and
practice and then just put yourself out
there and it's scary
it really is scary but it's the most
rewarding thing ever that people
appreciate you and people will love what
you do obviously you get you get the
dick edge and you get the people that I
reach to you but overall it's the most
rewarding thing knowing that people
connect with you and people really do
love what you do it's honestly the best
feeling ever
yeah it's the most rewarding thing so if
you want to do it go for it it's not
over saturated there's not too many
people doing it that's like saying I
started saying there's too many
hairdressers in the world does too many
you know or saying there's too many
coffee shops in the world do you not I
mean there's never too many of anything
the only thing I would say is so sad
about this industry is that people
always want to try and make it be bitchy
and make it be all this shit there is
and say odd this is what's good and it's
not everyone's just doing their thing
and trying you know you do get some
people that are bitchy and whatever and
what what have you but the majority of
it is so nice that everyone's so just
creative and just does everything and
loves their life you know it's
I think a lot of people just speculate
and just make up rumors and make up
their armor and make up all these shit
and he doesn't even go on I don't know
about America beauty youtubers but I
found out every year new UK everyone's
kind of just chill knows everything
don't get caught up in that even I get
quite a bit of YouTube drama people
saying this or people saying that people
are gonna like you in people aren't
gonna like you know this is how it is
sooner you realize not everyone's gonna
like you you seen you'll be like I don't
care anymore
how often do you wash your brushes make
such a routine so I wash my sponges I
use on my face every day
every day I use antibacterial wash wash
them and whatever because I just feel
like I'm using them with my face every
day I need to clean them every day do
you not remember ahsha's eye brushes I
tend to clean once or twice a week I
just cleaned them just worn in and I
don't tend to use many face brushes but
I will clean them again everyone once or
twice a week but one of you sponges I
clean them every single day so I just
did my winged liner and stuck some
lashes on off camera because I earlier
you cannot talk with your mom in viola
at the same time I will fuck it up so
you guys have to be demoing on its own
means answer sir what's your favorite
makeup looking you've ever done or do
you or would you have any tattoos and
your favorite makeup look I've ever done
I already know I don't know ever have a
favorite I just like the rainbow cut
crease I love the way it came out and it
took me so long so I do love that one I
really like the way that one come out
the other day were using the juvies
plays palette I loved that as well and I
didn't have a favorite know and do how
many tattoos night down and would I I
would like to but I'm so indecisive I
changed my mind
all the time so I would get one and then
a week later I wouldn't like any more so
I just kind of
unless it's something that means a lot
to me then I just don't I don't think
over I recently got the Charlotte
Tilbury instant soft focus bue flash
wonder blow and I love this product so
much but I think I did you want really
hard to get it out what do you do to
maintain your figure honestly I'm very
blessed and very lucky because I don't
do fuck that's just being greedy honest
I have a fast metabolism and I'm just
lucky I'm I do like how every so often I
did go through a phase of working out
all the time and then I just kind of
stopped I just got really bored of it
and gymnast isn't for me I find it
really boring I only go to Todd minute
she's like to come to the gym again I'm
like okay I have a drugstore liquid
lipsticks such a gloss is being honest I
haven't actually tried many a drugstore
liquid lipsticks I saw much more just
color by the way shit it's a wind-up so
good we can lighten it what was your
plan you left school my plan was to
train as a professional dancer and to go
into the West End that was my goal back
then but I couldn't afford the training
I had to drop out it was too expensive I
was absolutely devastated I did a year
and a half and then I had no money so I
can do it yes I had to drop out of that
but that was my goal when I left school
that's that was the career that I wanted
anything happens for a reason I wasn't
meant to do that
what are your feelings about the drama
shows and are there any you like drama
shows nobody watch drama shows that I
think mainly I don't watch much TV i
watch mostly YouTube and Netflix I'm
watching Power on that face and i'm
mitzi addicted to it so yeah don't tell
me what happens because I haven't
watched that much I mean II won season 2
so don't ruin it to me but I love it
favorite self-growth books and I read as
much as I can I think it's important
constantly learn and it's also I love
motivational books and I just love
learning about mindsets and just I don't
know I just really love to learn about
things that say I do read as much as I
can and favorite books I am reading one
at the minute which is actually called
mindset and it's like what about you
know your subconscious mind I always say
read about called Think and Grow Rich
and obviously inspiring but because
there's a lot of huge names in that book
and now they got to where they did and
the is really inspiring to read so
that's a good book to read this is that
maybelline rose I could see it in the
shade nude by the way well eyelash glue
do you use I use the demure lashes
eyelash glue I love it it's so good the
only thing that keeps my lashes on all
day what's the funniest thing that's
happened with when you're with Todd I
don't know because we laugh about
everything all right the other day when
he left my house because he had to go
because he lives like an hour 40 minutes
away from me except work yet to leave
and we would literally sit at my
daughter like me laugh and I was like I
don't remember what it was
laugh of us suck all the time and we're
both quite like immature in a way and we
laugh about things that you love my
humor a child
do you and Todd plan on moving in
together we do definitely we both have
so much going on what with work and
stuff at the minute so we don't it's
hard to you know I it's expensive it's
fucking expensive to move out also
because we live he lives Midlands I live
south but I live more towards London he
lives more towards Birmingham that area
he's it's hard to know where to live
because obviously if I moved to his area
it's like I don't know but my family's
here do you know I mean and like if he
leaves Miami like his family's there so
it's like we kind of need to meet in the
middle one finds somewhere to live which
is hard when you don't know you know I
mean it's hard to decide because when
you're new to a place you don't like you
leech you don't know you don't know
what's the best highlight on the market
at the moment
this so many like this so man it depends
what you want
I personally loved and I thought this
overnight I had to throw it out because
I'd lost the lid and it was spinnin it
was just throwing everywhere um this
sleek it's a sleek palette and it's got
a highlight and it's so bomb and I'm
pissed off at myself because I used to
usual done I've stopped using it well I
remember it used to be so bomb so I
really want to get that again it's not
expensive at all that's the sleek one
and if you've been following my channel
since day one you'll remember I used to
use the mary lou manizer by the balm and
i always are obsessed with that so I
need to try that again
because I want to know why I love that
so much I feel like confidence just
comes from accepting who you are I'm
just learning to love yourself and I'm
knowing that there's always gonna there
are always going to be people that are
better looking than you there's always
gonna be people that are um better at
something but you have to accept that
and you know that is what it is that's
us life do not I mean and you have to
just realize if there's any one of you
there's only one of you use any softness
of it's so hard and it takes so long
you'll have days where insecure you
don't feel confident and we for whatever
all stay real quick always talk about
the Mario Badescu this cucumber spray
and a lot of people got confused and
thought I said it was a setting spray
it's not a setting spray white set your
makeup it's not gonna make good makeup
lasts all day
that's not what it's for it's basically
gets rid of all the excess powder on
your skin like you know when you put
your makeup when you put your powder on
and sometimes you can look a bit powdery
and you're just like you want it order
melt into one that's what it does it
melts you make up into one makes it
extremely nice gets rid of all that
excess powder panic dissolves it and
makes your skin that like skin again
that's the whole point in spreading some
of your makeup so it's not actually
gonna set your money pop so to speak but
um I started using the Urban Decay all
nighter setting spray and I'm shook I'm
fucking shaking this product is lit like
why have I not used this before honestly
I'm just like basically I put this on I
did my makeup full beet and I went
shopping and
I had my Mike home for about five hours
and I sprayed that on my face and I had
a nap but I just snapped in my a couple
don't normally do that but I just had
enough like an hour so I was like so
tired and I woke up my main fat look
these exact leave this day we didn't
even transfer onto my pillow it didn't
literally my makeup look snatch and I
was like fuck I've underestimated the
spray because I bought I don't smell of
it don't get me wrong I think the smell
of it's really bad so before I went on
how I was taught I bought the urban
decay and the other one with the yellow
it's in a yellow bottle I think it's
like a hydration spray because I I've
never found a sentence but actually
works popping that one now but before
that so I just used hydration spray
stick like I said get rid of any excess
