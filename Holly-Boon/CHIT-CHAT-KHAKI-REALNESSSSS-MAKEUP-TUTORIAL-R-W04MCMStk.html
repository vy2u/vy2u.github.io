green look on my eyes I've been loving
green in my eyes lately I've done a
couple of bright green eye looks and I
want you to do more of a cocky green
today of course I have a green top and
my name's like gray on camera but they
are cocky I like quality green in person
so yeah so really don't this I off
camera and I use them my eyebrows the
benefit crap for my shadow base I use
the Maybelline the erase I can see you
know like always
yeah I recently got some new makeup geek
eyeshadows so I'm really excited because
I love new I thought it was like new
makeup I'm like I get so excited and I
have had a few of these chains before
but I just ordered actually it's so many
of them because I feel like I lost mine
I don't know where they went but okay
okay so the fire shade I'm taking is
peaches movie and I'm going to use this
shade on my Mac two to four brush as my
transition color this color works really
really well and as a transition color
feel like everything behind it okay so
after that I'm going to take my sigma
e35 brush and I'm gonna take this show
which is called high tea and I'm just
gonna take the tiniest bit of this and
I'm gonna apply this in the crease well
my god does anybody else get this right
when the postman comes and I don't want
to answer the door like that happens
sometimes on them I just I don't know
why I just don't answer the door I will
literally find like a space in my house
to hide behind the door something like
that it's like what you like and just
hope that the postman doesn't
see me I'm like hiding in like the
smallest gap when there's like no window
and he can't see me cuz I just don't
know why I sometimes I just um when I
was little - they're like delivery
bursts it's then I'm gonna use the same
brush and I'm gonna take a bit of this
shade which is called dragonfly and I'm
gonna apply that directly on top of that
other shade I have got the worst
headache ever ladies have you asked me
about like my what motivational books
and stuff that I like to read I've read
one called mindset one called great well
I'm reading one now called great and The
Alchemist is good I've read Think and
Grow Rich to see
and they do really help to inspire me
sometimes things can grow which is a
good one because it's that it talks
about a lot of them inspiring people and
how they've become successful and how
they got what they did know had the same
sort of outlook on life like really
interested in I'm wringing out inspiring
so definitely recommend that book and be
home right there whatever you're now
called great is about a psychologist who
works out successful people's ways of
thinking if that makes sense
I've only actually read it like two
chapters so I'm not like I'm ready like
loads of it yet but I'm like addicted I
think reading before bed is really good
as well I loved reading before I go to
sleep helps to ease my mind as well
because sometimes like I went better
sleep at night because I'm thinking
about 100,000 million things so it
really helps to ease my mind so from my
lead color I'm going to use this shade
right here which is called dirty martini
again from makeup geek one of these
shades if I'm a cupcake and I'm going to
use my Sigma e25 brush and when I pack
this all over the lid these shadows are
like so good I've always been a huge fan
of makeup geek shadows they stay
pigmented and like I love that you can
choose at your own shades if they make
sense and create like your own palette
and they're not expensive which is good
and then I'm just going to read this
morphe m58 six brush and I'm going to
take that shape dragonfly and high tea
and I'm gonna just go back in the
creator of these two shades and I'm
gonna go back to the shade dirty martini
I'm not a martini kind of girl are you
anybody I was like what does anybody
like martinis I'm just not really a
martini
kind of yeah you know comment but I wish
your favorite cocktail hmm I do like a
strawberry daiquiri I feel like everyone
likes a strawberry daiquiri oh that's
just the thing if you don't I could show
you Jackie then I don't know and I had a
Walkman attack me once and it was like
the best thing about of my whole life
I think daiquiri or a section of beach
but everywhere you go it's made
differently so it's never the same
everywhere you go which is really angry
sometimes you get a really good one then
sometimes you get really bad okay
I'm going to take my Maybelline gel
liner and my Sigma e six brush I'm gonna
snatch my liner so hard to film winged
liner okay
I wasn't it goes like this come with us
it's liners they're coming up my new
favorite I really love this but you do
have to set it with black eyeshadow
because um I've waited my transfer but
it's really creaming it's really easy to
use which is what I love but as well and
it's really black how good will it be if
you could wake up every day and just
decide but I colony one is like iron
someone of your bridge today then I'm
just going to take a black eyeshadow
just any black shadow it's fine
and I'm gonna set my no no it's some of
the Mac extended play mascara just gonna
apply little bit of this okay so the
lashes I'm using are the Coco - tears
and start I'm more so for primaries I'm
going to use my Marc Jacobs remarkable
primer I haven't used this in so long
and I found it wider when I was like I
never not liked it like I always liked
it so I don't know why stop using it or
anything it's pretty hydrate okay so I'm
gonna take my Sigma 3d HD kabuki brush
to apply my primer I also love the smell
of this primer I don t like coconut I'm
not a fan of it but I do love the smell
of coconut is that weird cuz I like to
eat anything coconut flavor on coconut
anything it's not a fan but I do love
this one of it and then after that I'm
gonna apply some of the shots everyone
Dubrow incident soft-focus a beauty
flash I love this I bought it
the other day when I wasn't done the
rest and I really really love it I do
think I did get lucky one because it's
so so hard to get out and I don't know
if it's supposed to be this hard to get
out but I mean it's so hot
and again I'm going to apply some of
this with my kabuki brush so for my
foundation I'm gonna use the
the Too Faced Born This Way in the shade
golden when I am gonna well I want my
makeup to last like all day all day I
will apply powder here here and here
before I put my foundation on because it
stops really getting ready for out the
day and yeah it just really helps to
help me to get my makeup to last so I do
that and then I set again once I've
applied my foundation and cream and
everything I then also have to set the
area again so I'm gonna just call it
correct
I'm brighten up my under eyes I've got
some dark circles so I am gonna use the
benefit for it in concealer and I'm good
at price on these using my Sigma
concealer brush
don't I'm going to use my 3d render to
blend that in I'm just gonna press it in
I love this product so much it's so good
to brighten up your under-eye
so next I'm gonna take my Maybelline
erase eye concealer in the shade nerd
sometimes I switch between nude and
neutralize if I want a really really
bright under either then I go for
neutralize but most of the time I go for
this shade okay so what any mic is here
to dry for a bit so get more coverage
shout out to Jackie ina for teaching me
that I love her YouTube channel you
should go check out and you pretty
already know she's got like 1.5 million
say you already know yet she's sick I
love that I'm gonna use my NYX mineral
stick in the shade MSF 13 to contour
don't buy too much of this today because
I mean so I was like that crazy with
this part and it is a little bit warm
but I like it because it does both if it
warms up and it kind of contours as well
so I like it I like it I'm then going to
use my 3d blender it bends in so easily
it's really good I'm not trying it for
foundation before but I am tempted to
try foundation because I do really like
it to contour it's really creamy it's
really easy to blend in so I do think
I'm going to get a shade so I can use it
as a foundation and trying it out might
be good to work at everyday foundation
I'm definitely going to do that and try
it okay so I'm going to use this pointy
end and I'm gonna press in my concealer
booster real quick I got this concealer
sent to me I'm through the post and I've
never heard of this brand I don't know
how they caught me I dressed I have no
idea but I've got sent this noise like
okay I'm and it's basically it's a
concealer but it's called amazing
cosmetics amazing concealer
and it's supposed to be the world's best
concealer and I probably owe try it in
this video but I forgot but I want to
try it next in a video let's see if it
kind of lives up to what it says
is i swatched some on the back of my
hand it is it looks good like it looks
good so I'm gonna definitely give that a
go next video I'm sorry

my 3d render and de Laura Mercier
translucent powder I used the born to
swim powder under my eyes and I really
really like it gives you a really smooth
smoothed out under eye the only problem
I had was I did get a little bit of
flash back of it it's a tiny little bit
of flash back and I was like I know if
it's because I may be baked of it maybe
you're not supposed to make maybe your
knits you just missed a set with it so I
am rich right again but I'm just gonna
set I'm not actually gonna bake next
time I think the Baker is what gave me
the bit of flash but my chin needs so
much powder because literally I get so
oily it's a joke and everyone's like why
should I highlight on your chin looks
really shiny I'm like I'm just lightly
okay
and in for Hollow it in I am such a
weirdo such wear so I'm gonna take my
Mac mineralize skinfinish in the shade

to favorites and I need to stop doing
that I need to actually experiment well

products a lot and
it's hard to find favorites but yeah I
am going experiment one I'm gonna try it
