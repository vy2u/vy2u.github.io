just initially blowed your idea and then
I'm gonna curl my hair so that's why it
looks a hot mess right now
whoa I thought I would feel like a tit
tat get ready with make something on
this in such a long time and I just kind
of just want to sit down and just chat
and get ready cuz I'm going to the
theater tonight with Laura we're going
London to watch a show so I need to get
my glam on so I'm just going to cover up
my Brown I'm gonna use the Becca
ultimate coverage concealer um I feel
like sometimes gonna do makeup tutorials
all the time like you don't actually get
to know me so much it's kind of hard to
like um fuse actually gets to know me
when I'm just doing makeup tutorials so
do anything that this is actually
probably gonna be a lot but I know that
obviously if you follow me on snapchat
and Twitter and stuff then I'm always
just like talking on that and I
understand so if you want to get to know
me more that isn't you can just follow
me on there to be fair wars on like
Paris skies things like that so yes
there were you know what I want to wear
tonight well you don't know one of these
means I want to stick a super extra
grams you don't admit a not I want to be
like brown to the gods like if you don't
follow me on Twitter them definitely
from intuitive always on periscope which
is like a live stream well I get to like
answer your questions and stuff like I
feel like it's a lot easy for me to
answer your questions on there so follow
me on Twitter and periscope and also
follow me on Instagram snapchat all that
jazz I'll link it or below anyway yeah
most you're going to just apply it all
over my lid because I feel like um I do
like the soft ochre paint with my Mac
but my eyes have been quite dry lately
which is weird for me never quite really
eyelids but
and might have been quite dry so I
thought that if you've got dry eyes do
not use the Mac soft ochre Paint Pot
it's really dry on the eyes and I don't
know what I look I want to do is be
honest I always go for golds and like
bronzy look
I'm just obsessed really if you just
does some powder on top of that just to
set that it snowing because I can't
decide ask you guys I'm six and filming
now so haunted like what I do you see
how this works out
but yeah loads of you I cried she
believed I was saying the other day I'm
periscope car as you believe that I've
nearly reached at 200,000 subscribers
like kind of honest I can't honestly
tell you how like briefing I am because
I never actually thought I'd be able to
have this is a job like it sounds crazy
because when I first started I thought
it would just be like a hobby you know I
mean I something I can do in my spare
time no it's that my job it's stipe
insane I'm using the Vegas nay Stardust
Stardust palette by the way most of you
always asked me about like how I became
like really confident and basically said
I really should people think like those
viewers say to me like how did you get
to that stage and it's just kind of not
one of the things I I feel like it takes
a long time but one day we'll just click
and you'll be like why do I care like
why do I give a with these people
think about me like I feel like just one
day I just woke up gonna fall why I'm a
bird I don't care about these people so
why do I care try me why do I feel a
thing but I can care about the person
the more you learn like not to give a
 the happier you will be enough for
my shoe is insane like the more you
don't care why people think happier you
will be
I always take my time when it comes to
eyeshadow like I literally take so long
I just I just like to make sure it's
like all completely blended I don't even
know what I'm doing I'm just gonna go
with whatever look already brown
literally do rounded eye looks I just
love having a winged liner success to
that feel like it's a phase I'm going
through when like I can't not well wing
but for the more I'm doing it better I'm
getting a nd quicker I can do it so I
just kind of don't want to stop doing it
do not remain class you have a day off
from doing your Winkle
is basically for up really nips how are
you going do it I saw oh okay uh-huh
firstly chill today generally they do
just like so like you just want everyone
to talk how ghostly my face is like I
look black most but I don't know that
ghost in real life like it's this camera
and the Lighting's making me look so
ghost I'm annoyed I've got like a spot
here and spot here it's really annoying
me so it's going to stay but but like
you look saying about drugs to and stuff
can I use my drugstore products and are
we sorry but I just find it really hard
to find drugstore products that I like
in order to say like our drugstore
compared to us is completely different
like if you're from the UK shopping for
drugstore makeup is like so limited it's
knowing that we don't have like
everything that you don't have over
there like it's just I don't even know
why I feel like by now we should have
but we don't um he's just I don't know
the frightened thing I find the hardest
with drugstores like finding like my
eyes are quite sensitive and if I use
like really cheap eyeshadows I feel like
it it really stings my eyes i apart even
tell you i have to be so careful what I
put on my eyes because my eyes are
really sensitive so I get a bit worried
because I've bought a few ice on a page
from drugstore before like makeup
revolution where it's cooled and like my
eyes which is like sting in so I just
like kind of just give its wary of using
stuff from drugstore like I love the
l'oreal true match foundation like I
love that foundation I think it's so
good and I always struggle to find my
shade in there but I just I am gonna
like go drugstore and I am when you're
trying to live a whole drugstore makeup
tutorial for you but um quite honestly
I'm going to I was like I love the
L'Oreal lip creams like this is the lips
I thought I love from drugstore like I
think not hey I don't like I hate
everything but I've drugstore mascaras I
love
this is some things I just I just like
to stay away from this eye shadow it's
just all from this palette this is shade
showgirl that I'm supplying now it's
like a really nice foil it's like a gold
but it's like a dark more brownie gold
you probably don't even have like a
Sephora here we don't accessive of meals
or nothing over there like lift order
everything online don't have Kat Von D
we don't have nothing when I speak to
people from America and about like the
UK choice to make up their life so
shorts are like we don't have this I'm
like no like don't even have that I'm
like no like on my leisure we have to
learn everything online we've had just
go ahead and shop and like swatch it on
a how much of the gas I think it's so
annoying how many is it inglot duraline
err
I'm obsessed but literally so if you're
like why's it so good I'm like just get
it like you just do just know if you
like gel liners like me and then this
one is literally the best is so black
and it's so light is not to put up some
of more a bit watery black to water and
I it's fine I find it hard to apply it
because this is a pretty creamy but
anyway he's been watching our island
literally obsessed of it like I don't
know what I'm going to do when it ends
like what am I going to do with my life
we're not on an end
seriously I'm not obsessive it I've
missed it last night really no I don't
have to watch it and catch up but I
really want like Nathan and Carver to
win but I did you love them in this okay
I heard Scott asked Haidee to be his
girlfriend
okay that is really hard to find like
genuine guys like nice guys you know
annoying because there's so many people
in the world you know but look it's
really hard it's really hard to find
genuine people as well I can really
struggle to trust people because I've
been around so many times even
friends like it's just hard to like
trust anyone which is the no and I
always treat people like I don't treat
people based on half entry edge
minions I got a stereotype everyone has
been like untrustworthy but it's just
really hard these days I find a lot of
people are just out for themselves it's
cool we got makeup we've got everything
else we don't need guys it today
obviously has to be attracted to the
person but I don't really go for it
people that are like stunning looking
like because I have to look better than
I was no I'm saying that you can't
bother me know what this new eyelash
curler hey here it's cold
despite in the the lashes flush fix
clear finished strip lash adhesive and
it's so read on I could but haven't
got any hablo something to do a bit just
like doesn't really stick them yeah love
Island here you went in to win I want
car run Nathan to win 100% right I do
think Adam is hilarious the stories he
comes out with like when he first was in
the air forms are always so boring and
just like because the array game a
hasn't got any game whatsoever when it
comes like talking to girls but he's
just so funny that stuff right I think
it's because he's but he's being serious
that's what's even funnier Pat them
stories it comes out we're just don't
buy this article okay die by it this one
just don't buy it is shit-faced my
favorite part I love to her face eyes I
don't mind but I absolutely loved in my
face so obviously I'm going to use the
primer water obviously you should know
this but now like if you say to me like
oh you always use the same products but
it's just because I have Holy Grail
products I just can't find anything
better and obviously I want to use the
best drink that I can so if I use the
same product over and over it's just
because I absolutely love it like that's
why um today take it as like me like
just I using those products of can't be
arsed use anything else it's just P
because like I certain products I'm
obsessed with I still haven't found a
foundation that I'm obsessed with yet
but I'm trying to do one today this kind
of your first impressions as well
because this is going to be the first
time that
is that um yeah one of you I'm going to
be using a new foundation today uh
Makeup Forever HD stick I got shade and
why for15 I don't know this is going to
be too dark I mean I really know I
thought this would run out quite quick I
see anything
okay so so far I think I really like it
it's good coverage I'm reading annoyed
about this big spot here I come silent
away why is it doing this to me I'm just
gonna I'm just gonna pretend it's um my
own when I draw as a mom I've seen so
many people do that when they have a
spot I'm going to turn it into my mom
because I can't deal with that I fill up
with funny things like I have to use
them a few times before I can decide if
I like it so annoying I just have to
deal with the spot guys got to do a bit
happy about it I'm gonna have to do a
bit because there's nothing I can do
about it now
so I back so I am gonna bake just purely
because I want this to last all night
I'm really I like quite really so Y in
an S I bake it's always happens when I
need to go somewhere I when I'm doing
something when face besides I know I'm
gonna get later spot so then honey
sticks absolute when she goes out
