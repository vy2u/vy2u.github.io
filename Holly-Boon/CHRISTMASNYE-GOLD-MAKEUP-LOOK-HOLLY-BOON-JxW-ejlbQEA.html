youtube channel if you're new here then
hello my name is Holly Boone so today I
decided to be what bronze eagle makeup
lip glaze if you wanted to see something
that you could wear for Christmas Day or
if you're going out around Christmas
time new gear that kind of thing I think
this is perfect it goes every single
color that you want to wear if you want
to a blue dress you can wear gold if you
want to wear any color you can go gold
and it will go and also gold and browns
are very flattering for every eye color
so yeah if you want to find out how I
did this makeup look then please keep
watching don't forget to give this video
a thumbs up if you enjoyed it that helps
me out so much and please subscribe
anyway this is going on the video okay
so I'm just starting with my brows I'm
using the Anasazi beverly hills dipbrow
pomade in the shade dark brown and
wisely about three one seven wind liner
brush I want a really sharp eyebrow
today with this look so I'm gonna start
by just underlining my brow I haven't
used this dip brow pomade in so long and
I found it
I've had this one for like every year
now and I'm just gonna follow the
natural shape of my brow so I'm gonna
draw a line just the top of my eyebrows
well I'm just going to go through the
brow and fit it in and then just
underlined to start my brow here as well
and I'm gonna just brush through with
the excess product off the brush because
I don't want the front of it to be too
so nothing use my Maybelline D eraser I
can see like the shade nude and I'm just
gonna use this to carve out my brows
this brush is the mac 242 brush
and then I'm gonna bring it down onto
the lid as well we're gonna use this
from my eyeshadow base okay so I'm going
to use my Beauty bakery translucent
powder just to set that so I'm going to
use my morphe 39a palette which looks
like this and what surprise a posture
she hasn't than hands on it why we're
not surprised so I'm going to use this
big pan right here don't know what the
shade name is it's the second one in
from the left and I'm going to use my
NYX fluffy brush this is the 32 brush
and I'm going to use this color for my
transition color so I'm just lightly
going to go backwards and forth just
above my crease
on a different fluffy brush I'm going to
take this shade right here again I don't
know the names oh it's just so annoying
I wish they would put the names like
just under the shadows instead of like a
separate sheet because whoever keeps the
sheet day I mean here so I'm going to
focus this shade in my crease and I'm
gonna bring it up a little bit but not
as high as my transition color now I'm
going to just apply some to the outer
corner of the eye as well
then when I go back to my next brush
with the transition color
I'm trying not to talk too much because
I talk for England if you've been far
away for a while gone I like makeup
tutorials always so long so I took 13
and I'm filming this video today and it
needs to go up today so I don't wanna
have to edit so much of me talkin out so
I'm gonna try and not talk I mean it's
pretty gonna be difficult but I'm gonna
try again I'm just gonna go lightly with
this shade focusing it in the crease and
just above the crease I'm just doing a
tiny bit at a time I'm also bringing it
right in see in a corner as well
hi okay so I'm just now gonna use this
shade which is I just used that one I'm
gonna use this which is darker and this
is my morphe M 507 a brush and I'm gonna
do the same thing I just did but not
take it up as high so outer corner and
in the crease this brush is really good
for going round the crease because it's
so thin it's like so small we get wound
away in to the inner corner then I'm
gonna go back to this brush which is the
Sigma e30 a which I use that light brown
and I'm gonna go back to that shade
defend out the edge
see when use my Maybelline the Rose eye
concealer in the shade nude I'm gonna
carve out my lid
because going back to that dark shade on
my morphe m 507 I don't want to lose
that
okay so then for my glitter I'm gonna
use the peaches and cream I listen the
shade famous it's like a really bronzy
gold I really love it and I'm gonna use
my NYX glitter primer so I'm gonna
probably get a primer fast just over
where I played the concealer and I'm
gonna use a different brush for this I'm
gonna use my Mac 242 because I find if
you use the same brush that you used to
apply the primer then go in the glitter
all kind of clumps up so use the
separate brush it's very fine it's good
so it's not too chunky just nice at the
end here I was gonna try and drag it out
a little bit because I don't want it to
just stop do you know I mean this color
is gorgeous again here you just want to
kind of put it out a little bit not too
much but just so that you don't have a
really harsh lines on your eyes then I'm
gonna take this collection dozen enjoy
liner in this gold color which is a
different type of gold and I'm gonna
just go over the top there
now gonna wing my liner so I'm going to
be using the wire cell culture liquid
eyeliner this is my favorite it just
it's so black and it just drives down
really much straight away so it doesn't
transfer which I like and yeah I like it
has a really thin brush as well okay so
I just did my wing off camera because I
had to get so close to the mirror
they're not completely even but this
struggle has been real and I also got
rid of that gold line that I put there
because it didn't at gold looks so fun
it was me anyway me yes if you didn't
want to see a winged liner tutorial have
got one on my channel already what I'm
gonna do now is I'm gonna take this
black eyeshadow and I'm just gonna apply
this on top of my winged liner just to
make it as black as possible this brush
is the - two-six much of brush from
zoeva
so I'm going to use my in black gel
liner in the show 77 and I'm going to
just run this and the top of my
waterline and kind of in this gap here
just to make sure that when I put my
falsies on there's no gap this brush is
the e10 small eyeliner brush from Sigma
so just apply this my top waterline and
also just here
I'm going to apply some mascara and I'm
going to use my L'Oreal telescopic
so when why eyelashes to be read to my
neck because obviously I've got a lot of
eyeliner on it's quite thick so I really
want my lashes to show so I'm playing
Koko lashes and more okay so I'm gonna
leave my lashes to dry for a bit if you
guys have watched budget erosion or with
me forever and I always forget about
them
I love shoes I'm going to first of all
I'm gonna moisten
and I've got this glam glow vogue cosmic
matte glow moisturizer and it's so nice
it's really strange moisturizer it's
like that I used it last night and it
smells like Terry's chocolate orange and
it just makes me want to eat it but a
summer lc1 would apply some of this just
moisturize my skin it's nuts Terry's
it's but I could win it a Terry's
chocolate orange right no not gonna lie
masking it well you know I'm off to go
get a terry shocker orange now then I'm
gonna post on my friend you profile
primer because I will use the foundation
and I like how these two work together
so first then I'm going to take my beat
your bakery translucent powder and I'm
going to set my primer I'm gonna say
here cuz it minimises my cause and then
just my teas mind because even though I
use that friendly Foundation which is it
does dry down map I still get really in
my t-zone it's so annoying okay so I'm
gonna stick mashes on before I apply my
foundation
I always prefer lashes when you've worn
them once I felt like there just smiled
so much better this stick so much easier
when you first apply your lashes it's
like a brand new pair of eyelashes it's
an issue they're worse
I'm gonna use my Fenty Pro feel a soft
matte foundation in the shade 300 it's
gonna put some in the back of my hand
and I'm gonna use this sponge Beauty
Blender I keep breaking out lately and I
think it might be because I've been
taken by it in it's the only thing I can
think of that I've done different I have
been taking the liquid bottom which
everyone said is better because it
doesn't break you out as much as the
tablet form but I probably have a drunk
enough water that might be why this
foundation I cannot recommend it enough
photography wise if you're going on you
know you're gonna take those the
pictures this foundation is amazing for
taking pictures you don't get any
flashback it just looks so good it's
it's one that I always wear when I know
I'm gonna take pictures I've literally
falling in love of it and I don't don't
touch anything else I'm gonna use my
Maybelline the erase I concealer in the
shade nude on the right
okay can I leave the concealer to dry
down a little bit just to get a little
bit of extra coverage and I'm going to
apply a tiny bit of my iconic London
pigment second shade four point one
ready the tiniest bit because this is
very warm it kind of works like a cream
bronzer
because then I'm going to take my Mac
130 brush I really like this headband
because it's like I can let you go in
and I don't get it in my hair it just
goes on the headband I don't know why it
took me this long to get a headband do
my makeup
okay I'm gonna blend in my concealer
under my eyes
it's crazy excited for Christmas not
gonna lie I am actually quite excited to
just chill and eat something most
excited about
she's did out have a few days off
and just eat and I'm excited because
Todd's got loads of time off work so
I'll get to see him walks I only really
get seen with weekends which is annoying
because really far away
they've got two hours from each other so
I'm excited to spend some time more time
with him so I'm going to take my other
sponge and I was gonna set up I'm reason
to be bakery translucent powder I love
this powder it's so much I can't even
explain like no you just set your creams
it gives you that really smooth finish
like I said if you can tell so this side
I haven't set and this side of house
look how smooth that looks it's
ridiculous I want is the same on this
that you can see but normally your
powders I find they set my makeup and
they're fine but they never smooth more
skin out this much you know hey this
powder just gives me the most smooth
under eye ever
I think this powder is 20 pounds on
beautybay I can't remember exactly but I
think it is 20 pounds people are asking
you a lot of for Christmas and you don't
know ask for that powder I promise you
your love it's
so good I'm gonna use my NARS radiant
creamy concealer I'm gonna bring this
down the bridge of my nose I'm just
gonna let that dry down before I blend
in and in the meantime I'm gonna fish up
my under eyes so so I say sorry it's too
much it's really I'm gonna take my
transition color this color first on
this NYX fluffy brush
then I'm going to take this brush and
that light brown shade that one right
there and apply this closer to their
lash line
then go for the dark brows this one my
hair on my morphe m 507 I'm going to use
my English eyeliner and then show you 77
I'm going to apply this to my bottom
waterline
I'm just poking it out a little bit so
I'm just using my two to six months
brush with that black I'm just gonna
kind of pry little bit just underneath
the waterline as well
and I'm going to use my L'Oreal
telescopic apply this to my bottom
lashes
when I just blend up my nose concealer
so I'm just gonna press it in I want it
to stay exactly where I put it
so just you kind of need to let it dry
down and it will stay with the
translucent powder just gonna bring this
up the size of the nose and leave that
to bake yes now I'm gonna be went to
bronze and beneath my mac mineralize
skinfinish in the shade dark deep and
this NYX brush this is the O three brush
I'm just gonna apply some powder
underneath my cheekbones you just let
that make for a minute
I'm gonna use my NYX swea lip liner in
the shade London
I'm going to use the Anasazi of every
house liquid lipstick and the shade
starfish
new highlight so when you use my Oprah
and Nicki ever glow highlight and I'm
gonna mix these two shades together
and then I'm going to take the lighter
shade and I'm going to apply this on my
brow bone and wait in a corner
so I'm going to spray my face with the
Mario Badescu
cucumber and green tea spray just a tiny
bit of that one and then I'm going to go
over it with my Urban Decay all nighter
setting spray so that is to finish loca
