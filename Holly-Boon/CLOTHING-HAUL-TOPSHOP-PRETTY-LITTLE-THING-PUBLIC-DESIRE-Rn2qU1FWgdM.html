because I've never done my needs before
and I want to switch out on my channel
do something different
those of you was asked when my clothes
are from so yeah I'm about that much
stuff to show you but I did recently by
a few things a lot went up yeah so first
of all winter watches I put two pairs of
shoes to show you that I'm obsessed so
the bow from public design on I love
this brand it's so good parties are on
point and also the shoes are dope like I
feel like these shoes I'm talking to you
can't get high straight like you need to
start popping Topshop or a drawing and
deliver like these shoes and ever
they're these shoes don't but show you I
don't think you're ready
these are so that I can't do
I can't you know a condo so these are
shoes how cute how cute these I'm
obsessing on most wellies I'm Reese
coast this way so I'm Reese go because
they're like picnicking at day how cute
are they I love them so much I'm a size
five I can't do I'll fill up we have a
moment of silence for these shoes please
because we need to appreciate our bond
now this that if I could get married to
these shoes I probably would these are
really wears like ripped jeans or like
t-shirt dress or something cool you know
but I love these so much on with this
second pair of shoes that I got from
public desire I've actually worn these
already and the pointy boots in news I
love these because I love how this which
lights the last decay is so light it's
really tight your ankle like I hear when
you get those boots and it's a work by
gear and I hate that so I love these
because they will tie at the top and
they fit really well and I'll point II
already have these ones with pizza and I
love them I feel like I've won and too
many times so I'll switch it out and
what's the point you want but I love
them I love them I think these
in black as well I love these these I
always wear these of like again jeans or
like t-shirt dresses what oversized
t-shirt dresses is like a denim jacket
means we look sick yeah pretty little
feeling when we want to know I love
pretty little things and I up
then I feel like I did love misguided
but I hate ordering from them because it
takes so long to call Mike your paper
next day debris they get three weeks
they read full-out so I've stopped
ordering up some sky din and I felt
pretty like a receptor game art like the
stuff they brought out reason is like my
Tom thing
yeah I've been obsessed with that so the
first thing I got is this pink quote not
I wore this in my last tutorial I
 love it guys if so they're like
it's pink it's shiny put the fur
obviously it's five Birds no real I love
it this is a size eight I think and this
shirt answer yes I say suicide a I love
it is so extra I know but I love
like this like I love colorful staff at
the moment I don't think I see faded
right I've like grays and blacks and new
different they're always my going to but
I'm really like pinks and purples and
girly kinds at the moment and refilling
it so this is so me I love this
I'll be remember right you're crazy well
I love it I love it
of it so it's so much of it so next
thing I got from for your thing is this
jumpsuit how do the labels of the stuff
yet and I'm going to try some to show
you guys I think you can treat it when
they remove black cinema book so this is
what's the Johnson looks like it's high
neck it's got like this lace detail the
top cares which I'm obsessed with and
then it's just like straight cut
trousers at the bottom like this is what
the trousers good life this is so me I
feel like I might when I'm going out
with benefit next week so I might learn
its terms I love it I don't you just
going to be c4 yet though you know
sometimes like white things a c4 it is
refresh rate in so I have to keep you
updated on continuing you see me
continue consuming but if it will be
see-through I hope it's not I select it
will be okay don't even have to wear
metal
because it's definitely going to be
see-through but I love it so
I'll keep the guys updated on that and
your brief see me where if I wear it
I'll be posting on Instagram sir yeah
next thing I got these are also nothing
more like going out type scene sorry it
is a two-piece and this is the tartan
so it's like this is lace detail I hope
you can like tighten this because I mean
even I've got fake boobs
this still gonna say in that I hope you
can tighten this so great my sister
going to meow but I mean I'll keep you
updated on that as well and let you guys
know how this works out I mean the model
made it really good
so how's it look out and she had small
boobs so here's what I mean right
the thing about there it except classier
if you have small boobs so sometimes I
really want to lubes and then other
times I like my boobs you know
but I should have just kept my old tips
for like what I want to wash it like
there's like a bunny we could just like
pop your implant then what you want
bigger tips
Sharleen anyway um this is just the cut
I love this guy
even when I was at home so much I like I
love this detail on the front like
crisscross lays and then you tie it up
and it's just like Midler I'd say these
cute isn't it I love it
Oh's another's color it's like that rose
pinky rose you pinky Dusty Rhodes Dusty
Rhodes lots of color
so skewer is kind of living for it also
I got these in a size 8 as well yeah I'm
going to keep you updated on the top
because I feel like my views are not
gonna stay in there okay so I am a psych
Clark forest well okay a John parks
whatever you call it when it is stuffing
in it like Tommy year i obsessed
find out there I'm Celeste so this first
one advice is read over sized I love it
cause it's just sweat all over run it I
know I know and its really love like
I'll show you it it's like really
oversized so it's one thing that is what
I've got on nourishing so you can wear
it just like a John the dress I think
that's what it supposed to be a jumper
dress I would actually wear it is with
some side highs or actually I would run
with these like these boots from Dutch
on par so yeah I know how about I love
sweater dresses
whereas oversized t-shirts I was like
where's me okay spare me nothing's
really key righteous oh yeah next thing
I've got this troika it's denim and it's
got a bit of embroidery on it how my
Gucci every come through is embroidery
name and not every Brian is doing it
embroidery is that we're all in like
Gucci for that back then and now is
everywhere but look how he is it's got a
reason it I love chokers like I love
them so at least add to any outfit put
so many you guys so many so many shaded
this one is that cute like everyday you
know trying to add to an Art Fair
register as I was showing up when I'm
this is whale excellent it's pretty
isn't it slow pristine I've got another
John Piper sighs John part because I
love this color look at this color I
love that you could wear this stroke are
you can manage to a club with this
jumper dress and some styling my boots
that would look dope on say I love that
idea
so this is what it's like to know what
other size the one Reloaded be a lace
massive so to decide a again it's just
blue but to me it's more powerful I
don't know what you guys is it's more
perfectly rude to me but yeah John for
dress again shock so I live in I live in
at the moment
just so comfy it just so coffee look so
good so tissue whatever whereas women
sorry it's pretty much all jumpers but I
can't do I can't deal it's cold
okay
new Joneses anyway this toilet is like
oversized decay oversized t-shirt
chompers anything oversized the Ripken
denim is me they ripped in him oversized

pink cute pink chested
this is like a really cute pink shade I
love it I love it I like it then I love
it by the video again is labor sighs

are really long on these I've actually
wear these it's like John 4 dresses to
retool then maybe not it might be too
short but on me it's really quite long
so so the same height as me or smaller
ceasing to be very long on you anyway
so my lovely site everything from pretty
little thing and then I just got a
couple of things from Topshop rather
than the other that I really need to get
in from Topshop but you know you just
type in tying up the province Topshop
you know I certainly think it's very
overpriced for High Street I think now
that's what we these other brands like
critical things boom whom guided sodium
same thing as them cheaper I mean they
really should down their prices they
don't need to those various we still
shop that I saw shop that I said walking
beam learners expensive I got this rule
