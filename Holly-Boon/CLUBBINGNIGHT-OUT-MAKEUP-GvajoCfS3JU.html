was wearing so yeah that's one way to
you today so read on my eyebrows my
contact lenses are the gray ones and
they're from visit vision direct and
they're called in front of it they were
like fresh color or something I'll link
it below anyway for you guys and but I
got them like last week there were about
30 pounds for two pairs the last three
months so that's pretty good to be fair
but yeah so first of all we will start
by priming my eye I'm gonna be using the
Maybelline fit me concealer and this is
this you my favorite cuz here at the
moment and if she gives it all the time
and absolute primer I know you're
actually gonna use the pro longwear
concealer because it doesn't crease as
much and yeah I'm gonna go with that
I always get scared
I haven't contact lenses in my eyes but
when I do that it's that I'm gonna die
it's gonna roll back into my head is
anybody else then we got that

just put some lashes on and but I think
I'm just gonna add some glitter because
I'm feeling my fancies and blow up so
you don't have to do this which I want
to but I'm gonna apply some map reflects
gold you put it up I'm just going to
apply this basically over where I've
applied that gold shade

false lashes and before I do that I'm
just gonna apply some mascara and I'm
going to use the lash architects 4d
mascara by Rimmel no L'Oreal sorry and

Boone and you can get 15% off and then
