channel and hello hi if you are new here
my name is Holly Boone so in today's
video I'm gonna be showing you how I did
this festival makeup look
I'm obsessed okay I'm leaving right now
and it's literally nearly 11 o'clock at
night and I'm annoying because I've got
to take it off and I'm really want to I
hurt but yeah if you want to see how I
did this makeup look then it please keep
watching
and also make sure it's give the video a
thumbs up if you enjoyed it and please
subscribe
yeah wanna see how I did it and keep
watching so I have already done this eye
of camera and I've also done my base my
foundation and my concealer that's it
and the reason why is because obviously
I've done with a glass so I wanted to do
my concealer and foundation first before
I'd remove that so the first thing I'm
going to do is apply my P Louise base to
the back of my hand I'm just going to
put a little bit back in my hand like
that and I'm gonna apply this using my
Mac 195 brush and I'm gonna just carve
out my brow and I'm gonna just carve out
where our first that go and then I'm
also gonna just press this on C I'm just
gonna pack this on the lid really gonna
press it in all over so I'm going to be
using the gb/s place the Zulu palette
which looks like this I absolutely love
Juvia space i shadow x' and it's you
right my fav so I'm gonna dip into this
pink shade here on my 2 to 7 soft to
finer brush from zoeva and I'm gonna
press this on just above the crease and
in the crease as well I'm gonna go in
quite soft best of all so I'm gonna
build it up rather than going straight
over to product because sometimes it's
hard to then apply shadows on top if you
pack too much color on and I'm putting
it all the way out we're not rounding it
off we're putting it out
the other pilot I'm going to use for
this look is the morphe 35o palette and
that's going to take his light pink
color right here and I'm just using my
Sigma e30 8 diffused crease brush and
I'm gonna use this to diffuse that pink
I feel I've got festivals you have to
just go hard with the glitter or go home
do you know I mean one of them like I
just live for it I love it and wait to
go to Coachella this year but it
literally just crept up so quick um I
just yeah it just kind of cropped up and
I was like oh do me as it was so
soon I'm definitely gonna go one year
because I just hate UK festival with
just because I hate how crap the weather
is and you can't rely on it and I'm not
rain in and stuff I've been to be
festive and stuff before but I just
didn't like it because it just rained
and it just you can't enjoy yourself
when it's raining you're not I'm going
back to that pink shade I'm just gonna
blend that yeah if you're going to any
festive always let me know let me know
where you're going I remember once I was
staying in Manchester and there was a
festival on I don't know which one it's
called I think about it Park Drive was
to me one that's like near Manchester
what in Manchester and I was like just
checking out my hotel and there was
people just like in hot pants and
wellies and I was like he was so brave
because it is freezing and it's nice she
chopped it on a train but they were just
so glam and just I was like I live for
that yes yes girls okay so next I'm
gonna pick up this color from the 35b
palette on my blank canvas 8:42 brush
and I'm going to just apply a little bit
of this in the crease
just to darken that up slightly then it
also helps when I apply darker purple it
helps to burn that anything's yeah okay
next thing I'm going to do is I'm going
to go back to this dubious place palette
and I'm going to take this dark purple
and I'm using this on my iconic London
brush I'm sorry to like it's going in
and out I just you know me and this
light situation I'm just so like on
technical and just yeah anyway so I'm
just gonna find this to the outer corner
of the eye just gonna press it on I
really need to get one out I don't have
a hot mess so I done we had blue black
was on I put like her blue hair dialed
the other day it was akin just black so
I put a blue one in it and I she did
work to be fair but now maybe some I
wash my hair it turned my white nails I
could grow a blue so yeah and he's gonna
get them redone then I'm gonna go back
to this brush with had the pink on it
I'm just gonna press over that edge
first and then go backwards and forwards
then not yeah I'm going I'm Manchester
this weekend because it's touch back
down Friday yeah so I'm like trying out
get my nails on until at the end of the
week so that they're fresh we want to go
out do you know what I mean you know
right phone videos I just feel like I'm
sitting here talking to my - yeah it's
gonna go back in and applying warmed up
purple bring it to halfway and then
we're gonna go back to this blank canvas
brush which I usurped by the other
purple
comment below like who's the best person
you've ever seen in our concert or a
festival and you know he's like the best
performer you've ever seen I mean one of
them to be festival and Eminem was there
and then Rihanna came out and I knew if
I did that was just like so good quite
obvious years ago now I think I was like
not like 2011 next thing we do is I'm
going to go back to my P Louise bass
gonna cut my crease and I'm gonna bring
it quite high in the inner corner yes
about the really helps to open up the
eye where are you gonna cut it to
halfway okay I can't
I definitely cannot talk when I do this
step because this is just that yeah I
need til I hold my breath
I'm sorry no it's for Coachella I go
invite us if do you like you know they
joined the little party things and I
just like hard and even though
it is like this then I thought I'd raise
the time god she's gone FAFSA ready okay
so we're gonna go back to that pink
color on this brush and I'm gonna go
over the edge so I have a clothing video
come in this way another clayvin trial
because you guys seem to like the other
one so I'm gonna do the same sort of
thing where I'm jumping on my bed and
Joanie clothes because I just think it's
more like just casual and I see any
space I have in my room show you
so yeah that's gonna be up this week
we're gonna try and get another video
I'm gonna try get three up this week but
I'm just waiting on delivery so it just
depends if delivery comes in time okay
so I used a shade from another Juvia
space pilot I just realized but you
really don't need to do that because
that won't 3:35 be pilot has some nice
food shades but um yeah that's really
like one reason freedom but it's why
we're doing that
it's really me yeah so from this dubious
place magic color and winds like this
world shade here which is called Oh Sun
and again one Mac 105 I'm just gonna
apply this on top of that concealer you
know you really need to use three
different - no I what we're doing
you can't let you just use that type Ib
palette the reason why I didn't use the
35e you pay for the paint is because the
ping
in that palette at the bright pink stain
my eyelids really bad and like the other
day I did a pink look with that and my
eyes was so stained it took so long to
get it off didn't call for like two days
and I was like dude doing the absolute
most trying to get off okay so I'm going
back in with the pink and I'm gonna bend
that again the next thing I went through
isn't really lying my lashline so I'm
gonna set my Maybelline eye studio last
in drama gel liner that's a very long
name and I'm going to use my vo Six
Sigma brush and I'm going to line my
lashline with this it doesn't need to be
neat because on the other eye I smudged
out a little bit swags out you know it's
yeah and then I am gonna put this in my
top waterline as well
who lit already knew I was gonna say
that and we're taking this iconic London
angled brush and I'm gonna light you off
that liner
smoke it a little bit you always say it
softens that little bit it's making it
harsh that's a gala bang with Scott you
would you awesome and say that up from
benefit I'm gonna put that on now I'm
gonna stick my last Sean quick I'm sorry
I've been wearing these lashes recently
and they're just old ones or in this
thing I have and ivory don't know what
these are but I've ordered some real
lashes because some reason old ones but
yes I don't know what these ones are I
think this might be opulence by Lilly
ghalichi you know they look like it
and nearly ashes are hella expensive so
ain't nobody got time for that honestly
truly honestly truly who has got time to
be spending that money on a pair of
eyelashes okay so while we let my lash
dry for a thick we're going to do the
under eye so I decided submit a blue on
to
because I didn't want to do it all think
about always you know more color so the
first color I'm gonna use is from this
morphe 35o palette this color right here
and this is a fluffy brush from ICONic
glue on them I'm gonna top off the
excess so I'm gonna start to apply this
underneath my eye and I'm gonna bring
this down really far don't be scared of
this bit because it looks so good but it
is a bit like you feel like you
bring it down too far but you're not we
want it like all the way down huh I mean
it all the way out here as well towards
the end of the brow see I'm just doing
circular motions and backwards and
forwards they look the festival makeup
you can just go in with color it's just
absolutely fine like you can just an
itch near stick your head in a paint
ball no one's wearing a brass McCants at
first okay and if you are what are you
doing okay no you can't go to a place of
a brass make yo that's illegal okay if
you haven't got grease on your faith and
color and why you there you know I mean
ya know what I mean so I'm going back to
my devious place palette and I'm gonna
go with this color right here
and I'm going to apply this closer to
the lash line all the way up here as
well I just think pink and turquoise are
so good together if you wondered how
they stick that glitter on up on your
shoulders and stuff but you know when
you go to Ibiza or if you go to like I
pulled quite yourself and then we have
it and they just put it over and they
use hair gel to stick that to young
there are some girl when I was in I
think those of me old car boot her and
they were putting on us and I was like
oh my god what you used to stick now she
was like hey I was like what what next
I'm going back to the morphe 35o and i'm
going to go through this blue color here
I'm gonna use the same brush and I'm
gonna apply this closer to the lash line
and we stick my last run before I think
lashes are so much easier to stick on
those you're born than once or twice so
we're going to leave the eyes to dry I'm
gonna start with the glist hot under the
eyes it's my favorite bit okay I've got
three pots up oh my god I'm really just
tip they're everywhere
the whole pot why am I like this please
I'm so clumsy I've got these pick and
glitz and glitter pots from Barry em
I've got ping pong which I just tipped
off about and I've got a white wine and
I've got this blue one it's like chunky
glitter it's so bomb I've also got this
face Jules thing from Birmingham as well
which looks like this I'm just gonna
stick that on because I thought not
so I'm gonna use my ash cosmetics
glitter glue and what I'm gonna do is
just apply some all the way under my eye
and then I'm gonna apply some just tie
it around basically but I can it upside
down triangle so basically like the same
as this side I'm gonna go with the white
one first and he's the end of my
eyeliner brush so this end and I'm just
going to dip my brush and it's it picks
up the glittery well so you don't you've
got any special brush for this you can
just use the end of your and you brush
like and then you just press it on I'm
not gonna do any bottom lash mascara
because it just doesn't really work when
you've got this pressure to put like but
on false lashes on binding thing okay
next I'm gonna go for I'm gonna put the
moss and more glue on and I'm gonna
place them with a blue one you don't
have to do as much better as me if you
don't want to say about just go hard or
go home you know I mean all right I'm
gonna go some with some of this blue
let's bet on love it love it love it
love it then next I'm gonna do some of
the pink which is alright but this thing
one I dropped every right so I'm just a
fine little bit walk low and then yeah
I'm gonna go put some of this one as
well yeah these are really cute from
barrio I didn't know they had these do
you know what I think you can you just
get glitter off you may like this really
cheap I think you can let you just get
like the black weird so have a look on
eBay okay then the last thing we do for
my bottom eye is I'm going to apply some
of this out of the blue Mike Jacobs
liner because I'm which is add a bit
more pop of color
okay so just on my bronzer off-camera
and now I'm going to stick this on I
really want to add this just this one
here so yeah these are from Barry M it
says lift the face Jewish drug use away
from the clear backing training
carefully on the glue line paste the
Jordan and desired position and press
down gently okay so I'm gonna pull this
off gently next is pop first
so in the right place no go ahead this
is really fiddly it's annoying because
it's not in line with my eyebrow okay
this better I feel like if it won't
stick for you you can just put you could
just use a glitter glue underneath like
that's not gonna stick so I'm gonna pick
that grow down yes to the glitter glue
see boom and it dries clear okay we're
gonna do the middle bit thanks
about ivory I'm doing the absolute - I
know this is gonna be too much no it's
not too much I love it
oh I'm gonna miss that bit on right
there I'm gonna go do the other side
laughs oh actually really like it you
know I like this is so bond I'm again
the Thao and Dwight stick for some
reason so I'm gonna just put some
glitter grater if you I think if you
wear this to last like wash dry first of
all you should stick it down with
greater glue
well eyelash glue or something something
that dries clear okay I actually like
that I know so if you look behind I'm
going to use my NYX suede lip line and
the shade London my favorite color
I've got a spot on my lip that is the
worst place to get one isn't it on your
lip line it is painful and for a liquid
lipstick I'm gonna use my NYX lingerie
liquid lipstick in the shade dominatrix
when the phase so I'm gonna use my armor
easy and other sides of every hose
highlight and I'm gonna use my morphe
m5a1 brush and I'm just gonna keep
applying this until I'm really actually
Bayman I'll actually obsessed with this
look you know
she really annoyed this helicopter liner
what do you all love this highlight okay
so this is the finished look
