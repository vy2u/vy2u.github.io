youtube channel if you're new here
please subscribe please subscribe I love
you forever please please please just
hit the subscribe button please okay
anyway that's annoying so today I
decided to do a colorful makeup look I
just love doing color okay I just love
love love love love wearing colors in my
eyes I just get bored of walnuts I'm
just like warm looks on the eye I just I
do love warm look so much I love them so
much but I just get bored of it and I
just want to spice it up I think in a
park I will wear color on my eyes even
if it snowing outside and it's winter
I'm gonna come for a sand color okay so
I did do a little poll on Twitter and I
was like babe to feel Georgia filled
with tropical islet or join me to fill
the morphe 35o a two-pilot more people
said the 5502 palette but i'm sorry i
just wanted to wear this look today so i
decided to film it but a wool film that
video it would be up Sunday or next
Wednesday I'm not sure call it gloating
on a Sunday and I'll get off Sunday
anyway I'm gonna shut up get all the
dishes for real yeah if you want to find
out how I did this makeup look then
please keep watching and yet please
subscribe all I'm gonna use this yellow
shade right here and I'm just using this
on my NYX fluffy brush and this is gonna
be the first color that we laid out so
I'm just going to apply this just above
the crease and these shadows are so
pigmented so you kind of just want to
take a tiny bit on your brush at a time
I just get so bored of doing the same
sort of warm looks you know always and
color on my eyes I don't care what time
of year it is
after that I'm going to go for this
bright pink shade right here and I'm
using my Mac 217 and I'm gonna focus
this shade right in that crease and I'm
just gonna kind of press it in
okay so then I'm going back to this
brush when she's got that yellow one in
it and we're just gonna blend out the
edge like that and I'm gonna pick up
some of this orange right here and I'm
gonna use that to kind of blend the two
shades together so then we're gonna go
back to that pink on this brush and we
do that anything again just to build
that up because as I blended that out
the pink kind has disappeared a little
bit the pink is kind of going over the
lid but I like that because when I lay
down the blue it kind of tends they're a
bit purpley so kind of looks like you've
added a purple when you haven't so
that's what we're going to do so again
I'm just gonna lightly go over the edge
so I'm going to use this brush that I
got from Anasazi Beverly Hills it comes
with the palette I'm going to use this
side of the brush and I'm going to dip
into this shade right here which is
called the mood I've got I've got upside
down so when I dip into this chain here
and I'm gonna start applying this all
over the lid
then I'm going to take my Mac to one
server with the pink and I'm going to go
back to the pink in that cruise I'm just
going to kind of press it
I do find reduce changes pre-shape if
you go to brenda out and rub it it kind
of just disappears it doesn't stick to
one it some reason so I just kind of
want to just press that rather than Rob
how it's changing to a little bit
perfectly so let's have it play down
another color on the oven then I'm going
to take my Urban Decay razor-sharp gold
rush liner and I'm going to apply this
just to cut half of the crease
so now I'm going to take any black
shadow I'm just going to take one from
this Anastasio palette and on my Mac 266
I'm going to just press this on my lash
line so that when I apply my false
lashes blending a lot better so I'm just
like she pressing this black shadow
along my lash line
then I'm just going to apply some the
sky right I'm going to use my Mac
extended play
so I'm just putting some lash glue on my
last year's and wheezing the house of
blush eyelash glue I can't remember what
ashes these are actually wear lashes and
then I put them in I finish box and then
I forget which ones they are
I will link them below I'll find them
and I'll link them below for you guys so
yeah I'm just waiting for the eyelash
glue to dry a little bit before we stick
the lashes on I'm going to apply some of
the pixie rose oil brand I love this oil
I already played a little bit before I
started my makeup but I'm gonna plan a
bit and then I'm gonna try some of my
friends here Beauty primer this is a
soft matte pro so I love this and then
I'm just gonna apply some eye benefit
Porefessional in the center of my face
so just like around my nose area it
really smooths out my pores like so much
so you guys already know I'm about to
use for foundation but I'm gonna just
yeah so reason them the Mac Studio Fix
fluid and the Maybelline fit me matte
poreless mixed together I use this all
the time and then I'm gonna apprise with
my Beauty Blender I was saying on
Twitter I don't know about Halloween
next this year I really want to do a
Halloween unit but I feel like
everything's already been done if that
makes sense like so many people have
done like amazing Halloween tutorials
I'm just like I don't know I just
something stuck for ideas to be honest I
don't know what to do yeah like I do I
do want to do what I just yeah I just
don't know what to do okay I'm just
going to quickly stick these lashes on
before they dry completely and then I
can stick them on yeah you do want to
wait a while for them to dry because
make your life so much easier
so yeah if you just wait until the glue
is like glittering nearly dry it would
stick so easy apply some of the benefit
brightening corrector with my Mac 195
this really helps to correct my dark
circles if I do this first before
concealer I just like so much barrel
so then for cocido I'm gonna use the
NARS radiant creamy concealer in the
shade ginger
and then I am going to use some of the
it cosmetics bye bye on dry I'm going to
put a tiny little bit because it's a bit
too light
just going to quickly set that the
reason that our seam a translucent power
does powder is super inexpensive and
it's really good so if you're looking
for a cheaper one that's really good I
highly recommend this one see I'm just
gonna set that before it crease this and
I'm gonna fly it up if Cocina down the
bridge of my nose so reason the nose
notice used and then really that's just
to dry down for a little bit okay so
last time I told you this was probably
being discontinued we're in Selfridges
that's the girl told me but I found it
online so we still have it online I mean
they might have it in Boots myself just
didn't have a list of dit yeah listen
it's been does it have been discontinued
but anyway I found it so still go I need
to stock up on it okay so do you just
continue it I like my skin to be hella
bronzed I like to look like I've got a
nice turn
I'm obsessed with this color on my eyes
I'm gonna let you obsessed good I got a
question
can I get in uh oh yes in one of my
videos I spoke about bullying and almost
like just basically saying if anyone
that follows me as a buddy then you only
prefer Arakanese girl right yes I was
basically just talking about bullies and
one of my videos and you guys message me
and says it like it stopped you from
getting bullied and honestly I'll kind
of explain how good that made me feel i
I hoped you'd you know I mean because I
think part of the problem is that we
teach people how to deal with bullies
but we don't actually teach bullies not
to believe that make sense I have family
members that get bullied they're still
at school and it makes me feel sad
because I literally on this high person
I want to go down the school and light
start going off with people but
obviously I can't do that it makes it
worse and it's like the brilliance of
the wanted the problem not people are
getting buried but the ones that are
getting buried always feel like they're
the problem but you're not the problem
so I'm just setting my small eyes so
always crack there and we're gonna set
the nose so to set the rest of my face
I'm gonna use my mac studio fix powder
and I'm gonna use his big brush from it
cosmetics it's my favorite brush I love
it so much so I'm just gonna press this
in yeah if you're a pretty I'm just here
to tell you die it's not cool and it's
actually like you need to start that
it's embarrassing
has anyone been watching like I was put
on itv2 are things and I'm watching it
so I started watching it I saw people
tweeting right and I was like what's
that and then I started watching it I
was up to like two three in the mornings
because I want it to catch up and want
to watch one of them so I've caught up
now and I'm just like it's so it's so
addictive to watch it's a really deep
drama you know I'm gonna take my powder
that while we finish up the under eye
I'm gonna go for the yellow show first
of all and this fluffy NYX brush and I
already ruined it quite low
that is liquid look amazing on blue eyes
or green on it because of like the color
goes up to greeny beyond the narrow fit
I think green otherwise it's going on
around
okay so then I'm gonna go through the
ping on this brush iMac to one seven and
then obviously I want it to meet in the
corner like that so just make sure it
connects yeah yeah yeah yeah I got a
question for you can I get an answer
yeah yeah so I take my two two smudger
brush from zoeva and I'm taking that
green shade that we use on the lid and
I'm gonna keep this close to the lash
line
I'm just gonna apply a bit of blush and
I'm going to use my California buy
benefit
I couldn't find my white walk eyeliner
so I found this baby blue one from Marc
Jacobs and this in the shade de jour
blue and I'm gonna apply this in the
water nice so I'm just gonna apply some
mascara to my bottom lashes
I'm just gonna add some powder bronze on
amis my state are in the shade dark
so from my oath for a highlight palette
I'm gonna take the shade right here at
the bottom and I'm going to apply this
with my morphe M 510 brush
the lip color I'm going to hit the
boldly bare lip pencil I heart
and then for my liquid lipstick I'm
using the dose of colors campfire
last thing we'll just throw my face with
the Urban Decay all nighter setting
spray okay so that is the finished look
I hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial
