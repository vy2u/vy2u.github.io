setup we've got loads of new backdrops
these different colors and also some new
light in which I'm really excited about
and so I hope you guys like it I just
want to say real quick thank you for all
the lovely comments on my last video my
Let's Talk video and I really appreciate
it I was really nervous to put a video
out so the really nice feedback that I
got was we it was just really nice to
hear because I just was really nervous
to put out so I really appreciate it
thank you and but yeah I've just did a
gold sparkly eye with a bit of purple so
if you want to find out how I got this
look then please keep watching
okay so I've watered all my eyebrows I'm
going from water like a defined eyebrow
for this type of look and they are so
for just a primer I'm going to take the
main beam fit me concealer just going to
apply some of this to my lid and I
carved out my eyebrow using the Becca
Ultima coverage concealer and then I'm
going to set my Sigma bake precision
brush and just blend that in
I'm just going to set that user my Laura
Mercier translucent powder why is the
light in yellow someone help me why the
other so I don't actually know what I
want to do my eyes
so I'm just going to experiment see what
happens and if it ends up in then I
won't post it but yeah so I'm actually
going to take at the Chloe
Morello palette I love this I'm obsessed
it's so me light all the shades are so
nice I'll show you I've used it quite a
few times now I'll let you love it so
I'm going to take show you skinny dip
first of all on my Mac two to four brush
and just apply this in the clue
so next from why make up keep palette as
I'm going to take showing mock up and
makeup geek which is this joke right
here and this brush is actually from the
anastasi Beverly Hills palette the mario
palette which going to the fluffy end
and you support a prize in the crease I
haven't had a good time and um you know
ie
okay then take my brush larger shoes for
that shade out of the comb or more la
palette so go back in with that show
just to make sure this blends nicely
okay so for my lid I'm actually gonna
take the Mac reflects gold glitter on
and apply this over the lid I'm taking
the ash cuz makes glitter glue this is
my favorite actually did you know what
before I do that what a wing my liner
because I don't if you guys have ever
noticed if you put glitter on especially
loose pigment glitter oh man and then
you try and win your lighter with a gel
liner it's so impossible hope it's
literally the struggle Israel so I'm
going to wing my liner first of all so
for eyeliner I'm going to take the Sigma
gel liner and shade wicked
okay so now I'm going to apply the
glitter and whenever I get any full
light it's easy for me to just go over
the eyeliner but rather than actually
trying to win one line over the top of
lose pigment glitter that makes sense
I find it really difficult so I'm going
to take the ash because makes glitter
blue like don't worry about getting it
on the back line you can just go over it
want like a line above this when I'm
gonna take the lip line liquid lipstick
this is in shade Double Down it's just
like a bright purple I'm going to take
my Real Techniques brush I'm going to
use this as like an eyeliner
if eyelashes I'm going to take the house
of blush iconic these are my fav and the
garnish degree that I'm using is by
demure lashes this is my favorite
eyelash glue it's so good it just sticks
them so well and that I never fall off
when I use a screw
okay so I'm just going to leave my
eyelashes to draw a real quick and I
want to move on to my face so for a
prime what about unit eight moisturizer
and I've been using the garnier
ultralift complete beauty day cream I
really like it so I'm just going to
apply some a desk first of all
okay so then after that I'm just going
to spray my face with the prep and prime
mac fix+
you guys know how much I love the back
of my coverage cream but this is way too
dark for me at the moment
so how would actually fate sound at all
so it's too dark movement so I'm just
going to use the Estee Lauder Double
Wear and I didn't use this in such a
long time when I found it the other day
and walked on my foundations and I was
like I haven't tried that in so long and
when i factor it again
so I actually do quite like it and also
I use shade and cashier for anyone
wondering
you
okay so before computer we take the
Maybelline fit me this is in shade 10
they defend this in a way take this
brush and from Lahti London so random
so I'm going to break that I'm going to
use my Sigma concealer blend kabuki
brushes the F 79 brush
okay so just to set up the rest of my
face and went at the Mac Studio Fix
perfecting powder medium plus is the
strength I use and yeah I use this to
set the rest of my face
so I'm going to warm up my face a tiny
bit because in person I'm payers
but in this camera I look the yellow and
orange of so I what's going on but
I'm going to take the Mac give me son
so to contour I'm going to be taking
this shade right here it's called
half-hearted by makeup geek it's so good
like I've been using it all the time
make ear and I've just been using it on
a small stipple brush and it justifies
just fuzz very well
you
okay so I'm just going to take some
other purple from the lip brand liquid
lipstick um on this brush again and
apply some of this to the bottom of
lashes okay so I'm quickly going to
spray my face with some fix+ just to get
rid of those excess powder on my face so
this is the new Anasazi Beverly Hills
grow kit of obsessed lose it all the
time as you guys probably already know
I'm just going to take this shade here
which is white sand
and then I'm just going to highlight the
inner corner what inner corner of my
eyes and my brow bones I'm going to take
shade snow from this palette
so for my lips I'm going to take the
Urban Decay lip pencil in 1993 first of
all
and then for lipstick I'm going to take
the Giroud cosmetics liquor lipstick in
buttercup is such a nice nude shade so
