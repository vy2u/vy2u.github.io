hi everyone so as usual I have done my
eyebrows and I've primed my eye and I
use the mac studio finish concealer in
NC 20 to prime my eye and now I'm just
going in with the fierce face tapered
blending brush and I'm using the Mac
burgandy x 9 palette I'm just taking
this light pink shade and I'm just
working this into the crease
so next I'm taking this purplish shade
I'm just gonna use the same brush that I
used to apply my crease color I'm just
gonna focus this color on the outer
corner of my eye and see I'm just gonna
focus on the outer corner of my eye and
just blend that into the crease
so now with the same brush again I'm
just going in with the darker purple
shade and again I'm just going to apply
this to the outer corner of my eye the
reason why I'm using this brush is
because it doesn't pack on too much
color and it doesn't go on too dark so
now I'm just taking my sigma e35
blending brush and I'm just blending all
those shades together so there's no
harsh lines
so now we're taking my mac 242 brush I'm
gonna be taking this copper shade I'm
just gonna apply this all over my eyelid
and then I'm just gonna blend that out
again with my sigma e35 blending brush
so now for winged eyeliner I'm using the
Maybelline gel eyeliner and this Sigma
yo for I think it is a winged eyeliner
brush
Oh to me
so from mascara I'm using the Rimmel
London volume flash mascara please
excuse my disgusting nails I have got an
early appointment on Thursday they look
at absolute mess but yeah I'm just
applying these eyelashes these are the
Chloe lashes and these are by jammu
lashes they're literally exactly the
same as a Sorel UK long lash but yeah
they're the Chloe lashes from Jimmy
lashes so while my eyelashes are drying
I'm gonna do my face makeup so if you're
not wondering what the is that on
your lip basically it's just a massive
bruise because they've got my fillers
redone and there was quite a little
bruising bleeding so I got quite a bit
of bruising which looks monkey but it's
okay we can cover up but anyway for
primer I'm using the Nivea Furman post
shave balm as always and for foundation
I'm using the Estee Lauder Double Wear
foundation and this is in shade cashew
and I'm just applying this with my
Beauty Blender I've been a massive fan
of this foundation at the moment for
going out on night style or if I'm
getting really glammed up because I
don't even need to set it and it just
doesn't move it doesn't go patchy stays
nice all day and so I highly recommend
this foundation if you've got a night
style especially if you have oily skin
um but I wouldn't wear this every single
day because you'll probably get
breakouts
yes my foundation it's crazy orange at
the moment but we're going to sort that
out it's just because it matches my fake
time really really well so now I'm going
in with Rebecca under-eye brightening
corrector just to correct my dark
circles and then I'm going to blend that
out with a Beauty Blender now if we can
see like I'm using the Maybelline age
rewind concealer just using this under
my eyes on the bridge of my nose a
little bit of my forehead and my Cupid's
bow
so now I'm just taking my laura mercier
translucent setting powder and i'm just
applying this with my Beauty Blender
now firstly I'm just going in with my
Chanel bronzer and this is the dura
fiber brush and I'm just applying this
to my cheekbones my forehead and my
jawline and then I'm just going to go
over that with my Anastasia Beverly
Hills contour care shades cinnamon so
I'm just gonna go over that with that
and that is done
this is the luxe highlight brush my
zoeva and I'm taking champagne pop by
Jacqueline Hill Becca cosmetics and find
this to my cheekbones and the end of my
nose Cupid's bow brow bone and the inner
corner of my eye
I've just realized my fake times it can
patchy as hell my neck is a compact Qi I
need to sort that out calmly having that
so now I'm just applying some mascara to
my lashes just to blend those in with
the fake ones now they're nice and dry
and then I'm just going to go in my
bottom lash line and I'm gonna be
applying that copper shade that we used
earlier I'm gonna be using this to about
3/4 of the way I'm not going to apply
this all the way across and the numbers
gonna apply some mascara to my bottom
lashes
so now Phillips I'm taking the max spice
lip liner and then I'm gonna be applying
the new Mac liquid lipstick and this is
in lady be good and then I'm gonna go
over the top of that with some concealer
just to line it up because it was a lot
more pink than I thought it was gonna be
and then just across it up I use the
L'Oreal Paris lip cream in 103
and lastly just to hydrate I'm just
gonna spray some mac fix+
okay so I'm going to show you how to get
a slicked-back ponytail my hair is a
frizzy ass mess right now but it's all
good so I don't actually clip hair
extensions into my hair and tie it up
because really pulls on my hair and up
get I end up getting like old patches
and things like that so I don't
personally do that there is a way of you
being able to clip them in here and then
tie it off and you can't see the clips
but personally I would just get a
clip-on ponytail so if I'm ready to tell
that I have is when Beauty works and I
think it was like 22 pound 20 pounds I
think this is like 20 inch 22 inch maybe
I don't know but I would definitely
recommend you try it anywhere so to
slick my hair back I don't use hairspray
the reason why don't use hairspray is
because it goes all dry and frizzy and
it just looks really in my hand no
matter what hairspray uses well I
struggle to be able to scrape my hair
back with it I don't okay lumps and
bumps and it's just not okay so I use
the beauty wax hi shiny spray so it's
basically got argan oil and macadamia
oil in it so it's got oil was in it so
it really slicks the hair back so I'll
basically show you so what I do is spray
the front hair and flip whatever
basic you just spray holiday to this in
your hair okay don't spray tube up so
you end up dying oh god that was too
much
it smells very nice eh I'm see with a
powder brush you just basically want to
get all your hair back as tight as you
can
I hate these are tough D bits here like
they never quite back that's my head in
okay so why don't you put in how you
want it so tight Nicki give yourself a
bucket and finger forehead yeah you
Spacek you want to tie it I don't try it
apart you tower tie it like a half penny
tower like well cuz I've got short hair
it is it's like a fun I've got like a
little bit of a bump here but once I put
this painting you Incept so yeah well
this pays how it comes it comes with
like a step for a bit of hair like care
that you can use but I like to use a
piece of hair from each side so from
this side I'm going to take a bit of
hair and then from the other side I'm
also going to take a little bit of hair
it comes with one big clip it's just
like one of these thin ones that you
like slide in and then two of these like
clip clip so I don't use them I just use
the big sliding one i this group thing
oh you slide it into your hair band
where you've tied your hair up and then
you want to ruin this bits of hair
around the back like this I'll cross
them over at the back and I'm pulling it
to make it really tight and you just
want to keep wrapping it around like
this
right and then once it's all nice and
tight you just want to get some grapes
I'm just clip those bits of hair at the
back
basically just pinning them so that it
doesn't come undone that's basically how
I get my slicked-back ponytail
um so quick so simple I kind of tension
this on like a daily basis I've been
going shopping or if I'm doing something
I'll do my hair look neat but just want
to do something quick this is what I
like to do definitely get a clipping
ponytail is a lot but if you had and
then clipping in clip in hair extensions
and trying to tie it up because they
just end up ripping your hair out yeah I
hope you guys enjoyed this video make
sure you give it thumbs up this is gonna
be my last video here before my holiday
