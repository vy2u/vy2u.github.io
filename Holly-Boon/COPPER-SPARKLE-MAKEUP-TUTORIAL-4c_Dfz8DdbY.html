primed by using the Maybelline age
rewind can see you know I've just set
that with my Laura Mercier translucent
setting powder so today I'm going to be
using the warm spectrum highlight by as
the Weaver and I'm also just going to
use a couple of the shades from the
makeup geek eyeshadows as well so yeah
so for my transition shade I'm going to
be taking Peach Smoothie by makeup geek
which was this shade right here and the
brush I'm using is the zoeva soft
definer brush
okay so now using the of the weave of
warm spectrum palette it's gonna be
taking this shade orange for a head and

same brush I'm going to be using the
copper sparkle glitter by Mac and I'm
gonna be applying that just over where
I've just applied that and for your
shadow
if you use a glitter glue it's gonna
reply a lot more sparkly like glitter
but I just prefer to look more metallic
so using a mac fix+ and then pressing it
into your eyelid just gives me more of
that metallic you look okay so now I'm
taking the Mac extended playing the scar

lashes before I apply some fake ones

the Nivea Furman post shave balm as
always thanks to nikkietutorials I'm so
glad like she mentioned this because I
literally love it I use it all the time
for foundation I'm gonna have to mix two
again because I went to get the dual and
fast foundation and she matched me up to
the complete wrong color and it's way
too light and then my I've got my dog
wear foundation which is a little bit
too dark so I'm just gonna mix these two
together it was like normally where you
do chatter like it wasn't really scared
when you sprayed on your face I'm always
scared it's not gonna go in my eye or
something
okay so now I'm gonna buff this in using
the silk finish brush by the way this is
