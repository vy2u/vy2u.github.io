hey guys so today I'm gonna film a
burger deep smoky eye and these contact
lenses of just put them into there like
a little bit uncomfortable the way right
they take a while to settle on my eyes I
don't know why and but these are in icy
blue by Desio or lick number like a shoe
want to get them and so yeah the first
thing I'm going to do is it would have
poured my eye
and as always I'm going to use the back
of a coverage concealer and I'm just
going to use my mac 242 brush
so I'm not going to set that in a reason
laura mercier translucent powder and
we'll take my Sigma this is the p89
brush it's called the Baek precision and
I'm going to use this to set that both
so we've stick my fuse coach money you
get money off and I love their brushes
so to start with my crease for my
transition color I'm going to take the
features and cream by makeup geek and
when I take the Mac two to four brush
so I'm going to take this shade wild
west and I'm going to take my Mac 217
brush I'm just going to apply this in
the crease
and then I'm going to take my Mac two to
four brush and gonna blend that so I
just kind of a keep going back to my
transition color on my blending brush
and it just helps Bend out a lot easier
so this is shape it in and I'm going to
take again the Mac 217 brush it's going
to try to apply this to more the outer
corner of the eye
I wish a cherry cola now and again just
opposed on the outer corner of the eye
just add more depth so I'm just going to
build up the darkness in the outer
corner
and so now just a darken up a little bit
mom's going to take shade americano and
again to surprise in the outer corner of
my eye and I'm going to take my Mac 217
brush and I've got to this is one
okay so now just gonna take my back to
four tubes going to spray some primer
water on this brush and I'm going to
take this foil shade by makeup geek
again and this one's called grandstand
and I'm just going to apply this pretty
much all over the lid to about halfway
and then spend outside I'm just going to
wing my liner and I'm going to use the
Inga gel liner in 77 and my winged liner
brush believer which is the 317 brush
this is one tip to get your eyeliner
really feed here is like st. you mess it
up around here just itchy get a makeup
wipe wrap it around your finger like
this and just run it along the edge and
it lets you sharpens it up
I don't ever worry about being too neat
this side of my eyes I can just shove it
out like that
so yeah just a little tip for you if you
 up you are now it's all good okay
so he's going to do what I've arrived
camera and then I shall be back okay so
I'm now gonna apply some lashes so first
I'm just going to apply some mascara and
I'm using the Loreal telescopic this
one's actually my favorite another heart
anyone can look really nice when they do
them I'm always at put Mama's going on
put it I such a weirdo and so lashes I'm
going to use the hue w/e Alana dashes
and these are number 10 I'm obsessed
with them as you guys know ivory uses
like 99.9% of the time and say dramatic
like me I cannot believe that all gifted
nearly over but it's nearly september
this year has gone so quick I actually
remember January I went to went to the
Caribbean in January and that seems like
really not that long as I if you love
the blue eyes sometimes I think blue
eyes and dark hair look so nice
putting up my brown eyes but I lied
switch it up if you guys ever recreate
any of my lips be stagnant or as dark
side for me to eat and I can see your
lips I really love like to see in them
and also if you Instagram it
make sure you hashtag Halle Berry Halle
boon because sometimes if you just at me
like I get quite a few notifications and
want to see it so the HD hashtag believe
in so I can see them and then I can
repost them up here I want to start
reposting people
my page so yeah make sure you start
doing that okay so I'm just gonna need
them to dry
don't worry about the books I'm going to
worry about a bit and so I'm going to
prime my face using Smashbox primer
water so no more okay and then recently
for foundation I haven't actually been
using the beauty brand know you guys are
gonna be like wow like because I used to
live the Beauty Blender but come on I
just kind of took a bit I don't feel
like it gives me a good finish anymore
like not you can't use a beauty friend
of every foundation it just doesn't work
it just some foundations it just doesn't
work so I'm going to be using the mac
studio fix fluid this is really dark
this is in NC 44 and I'm actually going
to reason this matte 130 brush I am
obsessed I only got this I predict for
two weeks no about we throw a little
riku rule no but I think I teach about
this about week by maybe two easier it
is so good I'll meet you up test
I'll show you give such a nice finish
you
to consider I'm going to use the NARS
radiant creamy concealer this is in
shade custard I've just been using this
brush recently just to carve out one and
when it works really well this brush is
the map one on one brush
okay so then to blend this in I'm going
to take my concealer kabuki brush f7 9
brush by Sigma
where
so then just to set that I'm going to
take my tape of toilet brush by Sigma
which is the f-35 brush my Laura Mercier
translucent powder
pay stand out for Bruns I'm going to
take my Mac give me son
Mac get results and my Sigma duo fiber
brushes the f50 brush I think my
favorite brushes at the moment are the
map brushes and the Sigma brush is
superb I just have such a wide variety
you know you can get Kabuki brush in any
size that you could imagine and I just
they're really very high quality a side
I really really love the super rushes
and the Mac ones are really really good
as well as quite expensive personally I
think if you're investing good brushes
um everything else just expire your
application we just call an online
Sophie investing good set of brushes
okay so for cons so I'm going to take
the Kat Von D shade and light palette
and I'm going to take this middle shade
right here and again I'm just taking the
Sigma f50 brush so I'm just going to set
its banana shade right here and taking
the Sigma f-35 brush I'm just going to
clean up the contours it looks sharper
ok so now we're going to go for the fake
freckle thing I'm obsessed with this
I've been doing this all the time so I'm
going to actually be using my dip brow
by understand xenon I started anastasiya
and this is an ash brown and this brush
is the Sigma EA six winged liner brush
I'm literally just going to take a
little bit on this brush and just
literally do it randomly so I'm going to
start like here
why freckles do not have I prefer so
reruns and Doc's in my face
I feel like these don't even look like
freckles they just look like I've got
black dots on my face
like obviously not real okay so it's my
idea of freckles which I didn't wear
this happen camera but very real in
person but anyway I'm just gonna roll
with it anyway okay so I'm gonna finish
up my makeup so it's on to my eye just
going to take why do I keep dropping
everything oh I'm going to take shade
bitten by makeup geek and my Mac to 3:9
brush I'm just going to run this under
my eyes
and then in my waterline I'm inside this
makeup geek iPad saw and this is in
shade blue plum area
plumeria I think it's like that I'm just
going to pass on this into my waterline
then I'm going to take shade grandstand
I'm just going to apply this from the
inner corner to about halfway
I hate if I highlight they take the
laura mercier highlight in indiscretion
and this Sigma
PowerSuite brushes fo six brush this
money favorite brush to use and hide my
face it's itchy so good
so for my lips I'm going to take the
melted liquid lipstick by a to face this
is in shade cool girl going to apply
this first of all then I'm going to
apply a gloss on top
and then I'm just going to apply some of
this highlights in the center of my lip
and then on top of that I'm going to use
these this NARS lip gloss it was
actually clear when I got it
I've been using on top of this and it's
changed it to this car so it was
