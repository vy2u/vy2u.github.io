filming a cream contour and highlight
and foundation routine I'm going to be
even the iconic London pigment sticks
because those of you have asked me to
review these so that's what I'm going to
do in this video and let you know I
think about them I always use the cream
sticks to contour because I really
really like it brings up very easily
their rear end with some excites trying
for foundation as well see how this
bloody seat by the way is from pretty
little thing it's going to get O'Brien
out underneath it's just a mesh bodysuit
so if you ask viewers from I will link
it below in the description box if you
want to get it I'm going to shut the
 up and just get on with the video
so for primer will first along with a
moisturize I'm going to use a child at
Tilbury magic cream first of all this
stuff is so expensive but so good I love
it
Cindy be a spacious go space go really
regularly put moisture when they rub
moisturizer on a face time for a doctor
school and then to minimize my pause I'm
going to take my infallible mattifying
base by Lauri oh it's going to apply
this and send her on that tune because
I'm not fine and watching it so early so
early it's joke also a part that we in
these these are like everything make it
easier and they come up with these I'm
like I practically is a they're so good
so I'm gonna have to go with this shade
because the darkest one that I actually
have my skin is a little bit darker than
this shade but I think obviously when I
contour and stuff it will darken up
anyway so I'm going to go this shade
this is shade two point one okay so
these thing we sticks like I said they
are recreate this is going to work well
for foundation really creamy so they're
gonna be used to be though ever really
like step their game up like when it's
London I'm using my 3d blender
yes I'm just zoomed in you can actually
see up close way to I but I really like
it of our nation it's actually quite a
shade much actually it was going to be a
bit to Liza it's all good
I might do a comparison video and you
like one half of my face
with our gastic relation and one side
with s and D difference because I
actually think this is just as good
I'm sure because I tried these
foundation sticks ages ago when they
first came out I didn't like them
they've obviously like change the
formula or up their game because they're
really good now we're going to use the
icon under stick for concealer / /
highlight and then again I'm going to
take my 3d blender and then that order
is your Neos is so good you ever had
these ones the Milky Bar ones you're
missing out really impressed with this
and then what the kreeson will be like
with it under my eyes I have like quite
wrinkly under-eye anyway so it was looks
currently but it's nice because I have a
room key under-eye
hey we're now going to go into cream
concert I really like how this is
working out must going to flip so I'm
going to go with shade 4.3 which is the
same that I always use I kind of use
this more to warm up my face rather than
quantum because it's not really the
right shade contour is very worn I mean
it's cool it's cool it works well it
works good for me anyway to Venice and I
always use this tool from iconic London
as well I just like this brush type
thing where anywhere I always use it
okay so now we just need to start with
this and we take my translucent powder
by Laura Mercier and I'm going to start
sitting under my eye area and then I'm
just going to apply a little bit of this
everywhere basically because it screams
you really want to make sure you set it
so it doesn't slide all over your face
or come off really easily for other day
okay so next I'm going to take my iconic
guns in illuminator drops and these this
is the original shade there are now
three shades as a darker shade and a
lighter shade and this one is the
original shade so this is the one that I
am using so I'm just going to apply some
of these I'm actually not going to
highlight above my brow blend today
because I've been getting quite really
in that area it's a really kind of shiny
so I don't want to apply highlight as
well you want to make sure you press
rather than rub if you try but if you
rub it is going to take your foundation
off so you literally just want to press
it in just tap there you go but I think
God ever stop using these drops I think
I love them so much you guys watch my
tutorials you know like I used to use I
all the dryer what says I can't do of
them also if you're on holiday and you
want that like glowy skin you can
actually put a few of these drops into
moisturizer and then put it on your body
and I know God you will look glowy yeah
I've got the darker shade as well so I'm
going to put the dark ones in like my
moisturizer that drops among moisturizer
and then I'm going to be go in because
then on top of that I'm going to take my
iconic London into the shimmer palette
and then let me show you which is
highlight and illuminate and this shade
is so bright like you see when I
put this over the top of this you're
seeing it's literally so bright and it's
when everybody have this on everyone's
like no matter what I have you got like
that is so nice
I don't know so bright okay then for my
lip I'm going to take the l'oreal lip
paint and this is in shade 101 I'm just
going to take from my translucent powder
on my finger and the highlight on top so
I dream up okay so all done and I really
really like those iconic eyes and six
pigment sticks a really creamy easy to
bend and build multiple coverage and
said a medium coverage we can build them
up so yeah I'm really impressed with
them I read of the I do have a card
which is holly b10 and you get money off
so I'll link everything below if you
guys want to get anything yeah I hope
you enjoyed it and I'll see you in my
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
