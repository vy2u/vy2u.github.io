youtube channel so today I thought I
would do a current favorites video I was
new this is like a September favorites
but some of the stuff I've only
literally started using two weeks going
to like end of September start of
October some of only started using last
week by breezing it non-stop every
single day so I talked about this stuff
and just stuff that I've been loving
basically it's a shout out to the
subscribers I just met in the nail shop
by the way like I just went to get my
nails done matte black I am living for
this I saw so many people getting matte
black I was like I need that
so yeah shout out to the subscribers I
just met just so random you I went to
Greg's to get like a cheesy because I
was like oh my god I'm so hungry
so I said hairspray fumes
everywhere and so yeah basically winter
Greg's to get cheese toastie I love me a
cheese toastie yeah and it was raw I was
like you know you're just like sighs yes
I want a cheese toastie were like you
want something right yeah I'm so excited
and you eat and you're like mrs.
this is I'm hungry and this is
I ate it I swear to God his cheese days
he was so dry I am the lettuce cheese
toastie maker ever yeah I was wrong I
asked any one of my cheese toastie for I
I was the best cheese toastie maker
everyone talked about a bit of butter on
the outside you know I mean make here
but you know it's host here make it a
bit brown on the outside all about that
anyway I'm gonna shop and getting with
his video also current favorite dr.
pepper I'm sorry but Lucas hey me
over like Lucas they just don't taste
same anymore
they decided with sugar they took the
sugar up it's hanging out soon replace
it shit's
sorry cuz a you're not what I want
anymore dr. peppers dr. peppers up there
with the Capri Sun on par with the Capri
Sun so I'm just gonna talk about this
price in a completely random order so
the first one I want to talk about is
the pixie Rose oil blends I love this
stuff so much under foundation
he just it just gives me an extra bit of
hydration it smells amazing
it makes my skin just feel super super
hydrators just so not I don't use this
it's like a primer so to speak but I
used to like hydrate my skin and then I
apply primer on top and I just really
love it I also apply this and sometimes
like before
I go to bed and leave it on overnight it
just really really helps to hydrate my
skin because I feel like as we get into
autumn winter my skin tends to dry out
the same places because whoever changes
my skin changes and um yeah my skin
tends to dry out as so basis so this
worry helps to prevent that and I just
love it up I've been using it so much
the next I want to talk about the Fenty
of beauty primer this is the pro filter
soft matte primer I love this so much it
I don't feel like it keeps my makeup on
today so like a sticky primer it's not
like a one that kind of fills in your
pores like a silicone primer it's just
kind of like a nice moisturizer that
really smooth out the skin so when I
apply this I let you feel like I have
baby soft skin it just makes my skin
feel unreal and it just works so well
with the foundation that I use it the
minute which is the Studio Fix food by
Mac with the Mirian it just works so
well with died most of the time I tend
to do the pixie rose oil and then I
apply this on top and then I'll put my
foundation on and I just love it I just
love that promise so much also and also
Liz I do this all the time with all of
my I always lose it is it's really
annoying so yeah after if thought he was
in a well as well so then for my
foundation I have been wearing this
literally every single day for
ages I can't remember how long in the
Mac Studio Fix fluid mixed with the
Maybelline fit me matte poreless I love
this combination of foundation the both
very similar foundations even though
this was a map you know a matte poreless
foundation I already feel like is that
matte being honest not as mad as this
anyway yeah then I just find when I
mixed with their matte poreless it gives
it gives their little bit more of not so
much finish because I know this this is
mad about I think it's mad at all really
I don't know if this image the u.s. one
but the packaging is st√©phanie to the
u.s. one but this isn't very matte for
me so I just feel like it gives this I'm
not so much finish some extend so I like
the tumours together and also when I mix
this in with this one it doesn't tend to
oxidize the colors a lot better so yeah
that's why I mix the two but I wish I
could find this in my shade because I
really want to try this kind of like on
your soil
I just really shock was a farmer trading
that and the Mac Studio Fix has been in
my life for a long time
this was with the this was the first
high-end foundation I ever wore and I've
had it in and out of my life now for
about two years and I always go back to
it it's just if photographs really
really well and whenever I have like
photo shoots like back in the day when I
used to shoot for like my bunnies dress
and stuff I always used to wear this
foundation because it would always
photograph so so nicely has got a SPF 15
in it which is trained for the never
used to get a flash bag even though it's
going to be up in it and it just
photographs pretty well so yeah I love
this foundation and I never need to get
a lot of training this because it's a
bit too dark but the to miss thing about
I do like the formula a little bit
better but I mean I would wear every one
of these by themselves so the next part
I want to talk about is the studio fix
powder by Mac and basically I already
had this now just over a week and I've
used it every single day and I love it
everything would I literally I don't
wear my makeup about this now and it
just gives me the most amazing finish to
my face I can't even explain so this
studio fix powder just works really well
on top of this foundation I use a big
big big fluffy brush I got this one from
it cosmetics I love this brush he's
massive and what I do is I just swirl my
brush on it and I just press it all over
this skin it sets my whole face and it
just literally gives me the most
flawless finish I love love love love
this product it just works like if you
get the Studio Fix fluid foundation then
definitely get the studio fix powder to
go on top because it just yeah Agis
looks bomb I did used to just set my
whole face with translucent powder but
sometimes I thought that can make me
look a bit ashy
and then I'm trying to run zone stuff
and it looks okay but I just think
having this color powder for the outer
room of my face and not my Cathedral
obviously about this for the out for my
face just literally makes a world of
difference and I just really love it I
really just spoke about this but this
brush is everything I love this pressure
so much is so a big and is so soft and
it just works amazing with that powder
it's you're just pressing on my skin and
just yeah it gives me the most flawless
finish so I don't know we talked about
brushes in videos but this one I have
been obsessed with but I fade this brush
is everything so yeah it cosmetics brush
they use the Selfridges next thing I
wanted to talk about is the RC mhm
Lucent Paola I love this part of so much
it's super inexpensive as well and you
got a lot of problem for your money
which is amazing
so I did use the RCM oh no color powder
before I love the formula of the powder
because if they're super lightweight it
doesn't make my skin feel tight I can
bake with it it doesn't stick to the
skin so when I go to dust it off it dust
off it doesn't stick and it's just a
really really really good powder but the
only problem I have with the no color
one was that I just found even though
there's no color it was too light it
would look really ashy under my eyes so
when they come out the translucent one I
was like I need to try that because I
remember I like the formula the other
one this powder has been just the only
one that I've been using as you can see
now I love it's quite pretty much gone
but this has been the only one that I've
been using recently and it's on par for
me with the Laura Mercier and it's way
cheaper so I mean I'm just gonna get
this one from now on I'm not going to
pay a favor when I have to fill up eight
pounds I think this is but you get this
from beautybay I will link this below
but yes I use this is set my under eye
and we can see it area and then for this
studio fix powder I used to set my
foundation and the rest of my face loved
those powders to to bomb powders so the
next thing I want to talk about is the
wire sell could sha eyeliner this is jet
black I had never used the wire so line
I'm not gonna lie for it's a bit bougie
I didn't I just felt like it's just like
you just pay for the name whatever ever
but this eyeliner is absolutely
everything I'm obsessed with this
eyeliner I can't even explain it's so
black and in the soma issues perfect it
dries down really fast as well as my
feel like when I do my wing if they pay
for me to open my eye because it's not
going to transfer because it dries down
so far as with most eyeliners and stuff
with liquid eyeliners especially that's
why I don't tend to use them I find that
I would do my liquid liner over my eye
and then I'll get like black hair where
it's transferred and it just yeah that's
just one thing that I really struggle
with when it comes to liquid liner
that's why I tend to stick to gel liners
but this one it has been everything for
me I am obsessed the applicator is
really nice because it's a super thin
brush seeing a really good precision and
but yeah like I said is really really
dark but really black and really mad I
guess the next product I beloved I kind
of
this products falling off it's really
weird like sometimes I love it sometimes
I don't know and there's something a
little bit again it just depends what I
prime mu time in but today I have got
precisely my brow pencil by veneficus
sometimes when I don't do too much eye
makeup I like my brow to just be a
little bit lighter and not so harsh but
when I want a snatched boss
bitch eyebrow like fully snatched I bro
I like to use his NYX timing frame and
and it's basically a pomade I use it in
the shade of black I have used so much
with a surgery one side is completely
gone if you guys has the I think is
quite a lot yeah like I said I've got a
lot of a relationship but I think it
just depends on my brow mood because it
does give me that really super sharp
brow is basically like the Anasazi of
pomade in my opinion the same sort of
thing is way cheaper so if you're
looking for a pomade if you like a
proper snaps Tyrell then definitely try
the next one it's really good okay it's
next I'm going to talk about high light
and these are both from the same run and
this is Oprah Oprah highlights are just
everything this one is with Nikita
Taurus the collab is cool this one's
called below goals this is so bomb this
highlight I kind of its tail of this so
much
so this one is more of like a rosy gold
hyper highlight and then the other one
was always more like a champagne gold
rather than like a rose gold yeah this
is like a rose gold highlight I have
used this a lot whenever this first came
out I've been using it since then and
yeah this is the nikkietutorials global
goals highlight and again I think they
had this on V base our link it below and
then from / or the on the color
highlight color and this trade right
here I've been living for you don't have
to buy this palette to get this shade
you can get it individually I don't know
what it's called but I'll look it up on
the website link below if you guys want
to get it but you don't need to get the
whole color and I literally only really
use that one that one to me is quite
similar to this group I was highly
confused because this glow goes
highlight is literally exactly the same
as this one in the palette I'm just
going to use any way you can find this
one in a single parent anyways so if you
want to find the book but it's literally
the same as this top chain anyway yeah I
use this shade as well from afar from
this book
yeah that one is more like a champagne e
more like a Goldie gold and this was
more like a rat who's got to flip my
cents but yes I kind of switch it up
depends if I blush if I'm wearing like
blaze a blush then I go for the rose
gold earrings I think it ties in really
well with the blush yeah we don't like
super bronze I just go for this one I
love it so if you haven't tried out for
highlights you read you try them they
are like so good also real quick can we
just talk about these matte black oops
you can't really see them they've been
doing with my hair which is really
annoying but having no key I got there
from new look
just quickly well when the subjects of
highlighter so the subscribers that I
saw earlier in the now shop and one of
the girls had a beaming highlight on and
I was like oh my gosh oh honey look
snatch I was like go highlight is so
good she's like yeah it's the one that
you were talking about I bought it
because of you it I was like oh that's
thick aren't you supposed to say like
what is that it's so funny because when
you see products on someone else you're
like what is that but okay it's the
same one I'll go on and say let's do
funny I've got three more things to talk
about
I've got two lip products I want to talk
about so the first one is this NYX soft
matte lip cream in the shade London
which I have on now this is everything I
love this shade so much yeah I do use
the NYX way lip liner in the shade lines
and I love that shade and I didn't know
they actually had like a lip cream in
that shade so thing too and I was like
oh I'm gonna pick that up because I love
that and I'm wearing it like actually
constantly like nearly every day I've
been wearing this I love this kind of so
much so I really love the next soft
matte lip creams they just was so nice
and was on the lips because they are
creamy they're not super matte and
they're just feel really nice so yeah if
you haven't tried the soft matte lip
creams I definitely recommend trying
them I also really love the butter
glosses were like you haven't tried NYX
lip stuff you need to because this is
balm
this is bomb and also at the NYX suede
lip liners I use them all the time they
let you like the Mac ones but so much
cheaper so you need to try them if you
have them then the other one I'm going
to talk about the dose of colors
collection with desi in hey this is the
over top lip gloss I love as it was so
much it's got a little reflects of gold
and it only just six so stun in just
over any lip color or I say sometimes
well I mostly wear this like just on its
own like
nothing on my lips and I just love it it
just especially when you're outside you
catch the light you can see the little
gold bits in it and it just looks so so
nice I love it
see how that's one of the glasses that I
have been loving and I'll show you the
NYX butter gloss I live for them okay so
lastly I'm gonna talk about the Urban
Decay all nighter setting spray so I use
the Mario Badescu cucumber spray as like
a hydration spray so it doesn't actually
set your makeup but at the end of my
makeup application when I put those the
powder on my face I spray the Mario
Badescu because it basically it's sort
of all that excess powder I just make
sure the skin look like skin again like
you don't look powdery just kind of all
sinks into the skin you just make sure
it's gonna beautiful just brings your
skin back to life using that Mario
Badescu spray I love that it's just it's
just on and then second of all for the
actual setting spray so I used two
sprays I use the ones I hydrate and then
want to set so Mary bless you hydrate
get rid of powder make my skin it like
skin again and it just briefs with skin
that's alive and then the Urban Decay
all nighter setting spray
sets my face and my face we're not
 move so I select on this
products for a hot minute like these
products it's whenever have a few years
isolate the phone called in it I just
bought even know if I was like probably
has to try again and then I'm so Frank
when I'm so super grateful Urban Decay
actually sent with the spray and I was
like well I hope I'm not trying this
before like literally I've got the
tiniest bit left like that much left in
here yeah this is nothing left in here I
let you use it every time I do a makeup
because it keeps my makeup on all day
all night just it's everything right she
sprays my face and then I had enough of
my makeup like I don't nap in my makeup
normally but I needed to keep my makeup
on so I was going out like later on in
the day I don't have enough so I was
like I was keep makeup on so I spray
this my face I not do it on a my made
car I woke up my makeup look exactly the
same before we just leave I was i my
makeup didn't move even Todd was like
your makeup this exactly the same I was
like it's this spray I'm telling
you so yeah if you haven't tried the
omen decay all nighter setting spray if
you slept on it and you're sleeping on
it you need to wake the up and buy
it because it's everything see okay so
that is all of the products that I have
been living for at the minute so yeah I
want to
my favorite some have been like just a
couple of weeks or like I just a whole
week and but these are part as I might
shook about like I really really love
these products also I just want to
mention real quick I have a misguided
discount code which you get a 30% off
the website for the whole of October and
so they planned off is a lot like is a
good amount and my discomfort I'll put
my discomfort right here but is Holly mg
30 to get they've set off the whole
website and that doesn't include the
Carli bybel collection so you can you
buy my collection I do believe launches
on October the 17th so if you were
thinking about getting any of those
pieces make sure you use the vibe set
off code because then you'll just get so
much money off and be yeah it's i
but only miss Kylie came that close so
yeah it's this she just wrote Amarone so
make sure you take your mind of that
whenever I order stuff on there now I'm
just going to use my card
because I was thinking and I was like I
really want to order the Bible
collection and so I'm going to use my
 codes but your vibes and all
okay so that is all the press that I've
been loving I will link them all in the
description box below in case you want
to get any of them don't forget the
folks that off code when you getting
from misguided um and yeah I hope you
