channel if you're new here my name is
Holly food it's nice to meet you and so
I feel reworks have put my eyebrows my
eyebrows aren't on so just I thought I
felt it weird anyway so today I'm going
to be doing an in-depth review of the
new iconic London eyebrow cushion I was
gonna do it like a first impressions of
this product like testing this product
but I felt like I don't know about those
types of videos I thought you can't
really tell it's really that good or
that bad just from using it once to be
honest so I have used this about five
times now for five times this didn't
launch on Wednesday but they sent it to
me a week earlier so have you used it
enough to be able to give a good review
on the product so this is the first
eyebrow question I've ever heard of and
I was super intrigued to try it
I've never had an eyebrow cushion before
I've I've heard of cushion foundations
and stuff but I've never heard of a
cushion I wrote so yeah anyway so I am
in the shade deep this does come in a
few different shades but I'm in the
shade deep so first of all you have this
bit here which is the cushion for our
policy open up just got the cushion
wrapper up there then you have this
brush that comes with it here I really
like the brush that comes with it
because this is the type of what I use
anyway for my eyebrows so this is what
the brush looks Sloan and then you kind
of just unfold it like that so then on
one end it's got a spoolie to brush the
eyebrow hairs and on this side it's got
a really thin angled brush which I love
because I this is the type of brush like
I said they'll use for my brows when
using up a pomade or a gel anything like
that so I really like the brush really
happy with that they put a really good
brush in especially this end the angle
don't being super thin because I find
when you buy eyebrow products and you
buy brackets and stuff they always put
like the worst fiber brushes in there
and I just can't use them there is a too
thick or they're just not literally
worth me so I was really really
impressed that they put in a really good
thin angled brush bit of me
when you first open this this prot art
when you first open there's like that
and it does come with okay but that you
peel off so like a protective
you pin it off and then you have the to
show it's so in the deep this is the
deep palate and on one side you have
more of a cool tone shade and then on
the other side you have a warm shade so
obviously I'm gonna use the cool shade
because my hair is ashy and black it's
very cool tone so I'm gonna B's in this
shade going to show you how it works so
I'm really impressively honestly so what
I find in demand I first dip my brush in
it is it's quite wet and I didn't know
how I was gonna feel about that because
I don't know if you know I just didn't
know if it was going to be too hard to
control the product so I've just drawn
online on my house you can see what it
kind of look comes out like so this is
the shade that I use so yeah it comes
out quite watery quite wet but then it
dries down and when it dries down that
is not moving honest I've just zoomed
you right in so you can see exactly what
I'm doing so like I said I'm gonna take
this cool tone shade this side on the
angled brush and I'm gonna start by
underlining the brow I'm not bringing
the pot I'm not I start with the part
from the start of the brow if I don't
tend to do that when I use pomade and
stuff and I just kind of start sort of
there to start with because then this
part I kind of want it to be
supernatural supernatural say yeah I'm
gonna underline the brow like so like
that what I love about this product that
I'll say first of all is because the
solution when you first apply it is
quite watery it really gives you that
sharp sharp sharp sharp brow I find with
Palmes and creams and stuff that they
kind of I don't know if you guys notice
when you put a line it kind of it just
doesn't go on super thin and super sharp
I don't know how to explain it but you
guys know what I mean and so that's the
first thing I was like wow like that
looks so good because it goes thin and
sharp so yeah as you can see it dries
too fast as well which I really like so
literally as soon as I apply the product
it's pretty much dry that's what I like
as well because I thought if this stays
wet I'm probably not gonna have to pull
out because slip around on my eyebrow
and what I'm gonna do next is I'm going
to just apply
it's just gonna kind of follow the
natural shaking my brow so I'm going to
just join up the two lines I'm just
going to do is above the brow as well
and I like because it comes with this
thin thin angle brush as well it's so so
easy to get a really precise sharp
brow that once I've joined the two lines
up I'm not going to play any more
approach to the brush I'm mixed you just
going to go through the hairs like then
just disperse the product so that's the
first bit done so as I said it dries
down really fast it's really precise
pretty easy to use I like that it's kind
of a wet formula I feel like it's not
going to dry out like pomades and gels
and stuff and and also if you just make
sure that you close the art obviously
close the lid you close the case I feel
like it's just not going to dry out and
it's going to be a long lasting brow
product and then I'm just gonna
underline all the way to the start of
the brow so all the way to hear that and
then I'm gonna lightly brush upwards not
applying any more product to the brush
just literally pushing the excess
product of the brush to be the start of
the brow so that is how the brow looks I
like I said I've used a few times now
and I'm very very impressed at this
product never have an eyebrow cushion
before yeah I'm just gonna use my finger
and just Pat the brow so I can show you
that and no products coming from my
finger so it dries down really fast but
it's a very very liquidy formula I also
fine with this brow product is it's not
as messy it's nowhere near as messy as a
pomade or a gel and also I think is a
really good on the go I rub eyebrow kit
because you've got the little brush in
there which is actually a really good
brush it's not crap one so just a little
bracket like that but I'm really
impressed with the product I when they
sent it to me I like she was like sorry
trade because like I said I've never had
cushion Bravo I was really intrigued by
it I don't think I would love for them
to do is to do the same thing but do a
whole one of each color that makes sense
so I could have a whole one of this
color but yeah I thought I'd give you
guys a review instead of just a first
impressions are like a testing video
because I want it to make sure I'd used
it a few times and I you know I was
really sure about liking the quality is
there these microwaves I'm tonie's that
now but sometimes I use pencil I used
the precise of my brow pen so sometimes
but when I want that shot Brown like
there's definitely gonna be using this
