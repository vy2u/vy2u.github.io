went really well so the fingers crossed
this goes very well and I have actually
got a tub polishes - cropped up just a
denim crop top so yeah I know I look
like I'm a little bit naked by so good
I'm just going to get straight into
videos though for my transition color

promised my eye I use the NARS radiant
creamy concealer and then I say it with
a powder
okay so now I'm going to take my winged
liner brush by Sigma which the area six
brush and I'm going to take shape
peanut butter from the semi-sweet
chocolate palette and I'm going to apply
this just a Cotton's on the cut off my
shoes in the shade
and then going to take my short shader
brush my face face and just blend out
that line slightly
I'm going in with my Mac two to four
brush I'm going to take that show you
peanut butter I'm just going to apply
that just above this line you really
lightly it doesn't matter too much if
you go grind the laughs a hot follow the
line because I'm going to clean up
anyway so you don't have to be like
really really neat as long as you make
sure you blend this line you want to
make sure it's really blended
I'm just going to go back to beaches and
creams you just fluffy brush by fierce
face I'm just going to quick keep making
sure that I give up to my transition
color just to make sure it's really been
there then next taking my winged liner
brush by Sigma again three small one
it's the eo6 brush and when you take
shape truffle from this palette just
shave right here and I'm going to carve
out that line again
and then taking my short shader brush my
fierce face again I'm going to fill up
that line on this properly going to take
that shade which is truffle and then
when it to give lineup and dose darken
it
and taking my Mac to - I'm going to go
back to that say peanut butter which is
a light brown shade and just pull out
all these lot
now taking my soft ochre Paint Pot by
Mac and my Mac - 2 - 4 - brush sorry I'm
going to carve that out
you
okay so now take care of the EO 6 5 by
Sigma I'm going to take shade peanut
butter and I'm literally going to carve
out my lid now
so now I'm gonna take my car Yujin art

is in shade copper I'm going to take
this it's such a gorgeous gold shade
it's really real acting really really
nice and take it on my mac 242 brush and
the notify this open the lid I don't
want this all over I detriment this
about half way
now on the same brush I'm going to take
Shh ruffles
now I'm going to take my anastasiya gel
liner in black and again I'm taking the
winged liner brush by Sigma and I'm
gonna go over this in black and you want
to take this too literally about there

put in funny funny funny funny
so for profile we're going to use this
much books prime water as always and
then foundation I'm going to use the
NARS sheer glow in this in shade
Syracuse I think I say say it
maybe not I'll link it below anyway see
you guys and amusingly Sigma and kabuki
brush to be f-89 brush I love this for
foundation it will just apply the
foundation so good
so if I can see it I'm actually going to
use the naked skin concealer by urban
decay this is like the wrong shade for
me to be honest it's way too light
just going to run that in my beauty
render this is dumb as well

going to take Shh awkward first of all
I'm going liner brush

Oh
so for highlighter I'm gonna take the
rimmel see a highlight in indiscretion
obsessed this is the only one I've been
using at the moment which is weird for
me because I know we switch them off all
the time but this has been like my
absolute favorite ever
so just realize I've got literally black
eyeliner all over me and I'm going to
use my Sigma powder sweep brushes to s
basics I really like this brush for
highlighting it's really good
so then for lips I'm going to take the
melted matte lipstick in child stars by
