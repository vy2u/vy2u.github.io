use this brush brush

watch my videos all the time and
recently I decided to try and send a
romantic anyone because everyone was

I actually prefer it because it doesn't
fit as cakey it just feels like nice hi
Serena but it's just a lot better anyway

trying to like a boots the backdrop and
I was like trying to pick up and I just
I just called I just can't do it

something for eyeshadow I'm gonna be
using the Stardust palette by Too Faced
and Baker's name my favorite at the
moment and shoot from white spruce for

brush I'm going to use shade millennial
but then you I think it's like a real
light pink and I yeah I'm gonna do it go
in my crease with this shade and if you
guys can hear it it's so windy here like
oh is he throwing out the house is gonna
blow up because I knew of like in the
hood of no but I like I don't have my
neighbors or anything he says like a
open land so like when it's windy it's
like crazy please every night what kind
of videos you want to see more because I
want to keep you guys entertained I
don't want to like just keep doing
makeup tutorial if you like to get bored
of it um I was gonna kind of do a video
and like how to get like Instagram
followers and how I managed to get 50k
because it really think we got long with
his last year was on like 900 and it is
crazy it took me a year but I'd love to
show you guys like how I did that is

fit so much better I'm like okay no in
this vein so I'm just gonna apply that
to the outer corner it's quite messy or
the remark she's gonna bend it and then
I'm gonna take the brush that I used the
brush that I used for my transition I'm
just gonna use that to blend those two
together I thought this video could you
start along because normally like when I
edit I kind of like to speed it up
because I'm talking like I can't do that
so I'm sorry it's gonna be so long after
than that I'm gonna go in with some
glitter and I'm gonna be using the Mac
Hickman is called a flex get for flex a
nice gold chamber it's like white I'm
gonna be using this so I'm then going to
take this Stila brush this is number 13
it's like a mini brush if it's like a
flap sort of eyeliner brush but I like
to use it to apply the glitter yeah I'm
just gonna spray some mac fix+ onto this
brush as fast as it sticks nicely i buy
that from sort of the inner corner to
about halfway I'm just gonna like pack
it on and on you know and I cannot bear
any more bit remaining I'm grating that
I'm gonna add a nude lip with this but
you guys could really add like a dark
lip with this it'll look really nice or
even like a red little Christmas
this is that she falling out what over
my face this is why we have to do the
eyes fast because the way you're gonna
end up with it I like all over your
concealer and foundation and just gonna
pick you off so do you know why I
absolutely love Patrick Starr like I've
been watching his video is like lady and
I never really thought she's videos
before I don't know why he was popped up
I never liked clicked on it I'm recently
I love emotion I absolutely love him
like he is so funny and I haven't sucked
at everything he is like I'm loving him
and then I'm just gonna take my secret -
hey Patti 35 brush I'm just gonna go
back into my crease like that I'm just
gonna kind of blend it out so it's not
like harsh I'm just gonna have been out
and then just black I would cut into the
crease then I'm gonna go in with my
mascara
and I'm gonna use these extra black
extra black of volume in flash mascara
by remote I just got a new one
yesterday's okay I'm just gonna apply
some mascara my little tiny nose yeah I
love you do not go then for lashes so
I've had all these yesterday so they're
already stuck together but what I did is
I ride the Ardo demi whispies and then
applied the Sorel UK lashes as well
because I like the Wis penis of the demi
whispies and I like the length of the
other ones so I just applied both you
guys asked me how do apply lashes
because you struggle with it I used to
struggle a bit like ice the one who got
the hardest thing and then I just kept
doing it doing it and now it's okay so
I'd say apply the grave wait for it to
dry for a little while don't you try
sticking straight away because then
you're just done it with glue everywhere
tonight now so yeah definitely waitress
try a little bit first is they I do
manage to get over the blow off my
growth all the guitar off my famous
because it's so hard to get off this
girl and so I'm just gonna pray that
basically one of my face maker one it
comes it up it so for foundation I'm
going to use the Mac Studio Fix fluid in
NC 35 and the Sigma 3d HD kabuki brush
and yes it's there to you because they
usually yesterday honestly like I wrote
like how do you do it like these more
hateful comments that you get and I kind
of just think like I enjoy what I'm
doing it and I'm so like confident in
myself that I don't really care
everything like I don't
knowing that you exist like if you walk
past me in the street I wouldn't even
know who you are so why would I care
about your opinion do you know what I
mean I'm just here to do what I want to
do and I'm just here to people that
enjoy it and I don't care if you don't
don't watch do you not I mean so yeah
basically if you're gonna write a
hateful comment then I had to desert
okay yeah you know what I get quite a
lot as well no yes is people Taylor like
by whoa that's the one thing I'm just
like really I don't know
you know what though there are so many
guys that slay the makeup game and they
do their makeup better than most girls
and I think I was coming and I just so
bitter about it like why'd you to be so
angry all the time
I can't feel for people I got honestly
filled with people that are that
insecure they feel they have to put
other people down oh my god honestly
just feel sorry people like that like I
used to be a incredibly insecure person
and even then I would not even dream or
comment in anything horrible on anyone's
page I just think it kind of shows what
kind of person you are really now I'm
going to go in for with my concealer
it's going to try somewhere outside
semester
you don't like you wear this makeup on a
day to day and I was like yeah why not
why the not well I know if you want
to add like a big ol eyelashes and you
want to wear lipstick all over
your eyebrows and why the not
why not like people need to stop saying
mate like making out the maker was such
a bad thing like oh my god she looks so
different without makeup like duh
weren't born with glittery eyelids I
think like it's just an expression of
your personality like do you know what I
mean it's just it's supposed to be fun
he's not supposed to be something that
supposed to be like made out to be like
such a bad thing and one guys are like
I'm gonna take a swimmer on the first
day it's like shut the up seriously
I feel with guys they always think the
Vatican they are have United it's like a
scout we always sing for uglier than we
are I quit was like oh my god I want to
change this I hate this like let's go
and I like the word for it but then boys
are just like I'm one girl again you
know maybe by the way I'm using that
concealer that I used if I'm on the Mac
one if you wondered so I'm just gonna
brighten up my under eye because it's IR
you suffer from quite dark circles under
my eyes I don't know why I tend to get
like quite a lot of sleep like I need
sleep on one of those before I have to
sleep if I don't sleep I mean I will be
like so moody
like no we want to come near me I'm such
a bitch
so now I'm going to use my beauty but
I'm dr. Breeland Rowland
but a lot of you guys as well I've like
said to me like Oh
like how how like what would you
recommend to starting a YouTube channel
and stuff like I don't really know you
because I feel like it's just luck
because I feel like the best thing you
can do is be yourself because there's so
many people doing the exact same thing
that you'll do is like I'm doing a
makeup and there's so many other makeup
people that do makeup so it's kind of
like what do you guys to get to know me
as a person and like me for me so that
you do watch my videos and you do like
many rather than just watch me because
of my makeup tutorials of zombies then
you're like I when I watch youtube
videos I can spot when someone's don't
be in themselves and someone's like
trying to pretend to be something
they're not like it's so so obvious so
just I would say like just don't try and
fake it and be someone you're not
because you're ready for yourself as
well I'm just gonna head with the laura
mercier setting powder some stats of
that it's porn implants just gonna use
my booty bender again you want to set
that because it will just stay nice and
it won't move
we need to clean my brushes and my
beauty vendor because they're any use
them on myself like my brushes and stuff
I do you tend to clean like that often
more I kind of clean them right once
every three weeks and my finger the
other day I finally feel like I want to
clean them again so I was gonna set the
rest of my face as well just so my
powder goes on quite another
I get like kind of weird chin I've
always got quite an oily chin so I'm
just gonna take my Anastasia Beverly
Hills confort while yet and this is
shade cinnamon and then this fluffy
angled brush that I got from eBay with
that set with that other concealer brush
like a years ago when I start doing
makeup and and again I'm still a huge
fan of this brush I think it must have
been like a little like a pounds on in
and I actually really liked it you don't
need to use like really high-end brushes
to get like a really good makeup a lot
of people think you need to spend a lot
of money but you wanna see do not like I
kind of want to try and find more
drugstore products TAS and I love the
l'oreal true match foundation but i have
to kind of switch my foundations up
every now and then but my skin gets too
used to one it then starts to look
pretty bad so like I can't just where I
want Fondation all the time but the Mac
Studio Fix fluid is good for when you're
going out because it's such bull
coverage and it stays on a nice like all
night and the Double Wear foundation of
a state order is good as well for going
out would have recommend you around that
everyday though because it's so thick my
contour looks really crazy on camera but
in real life it's really not I don't
know why that is I could they're like I
can see in the camera that it was crazy
but it really doesn't Ramon I okay I'm
using the sleek makeup highlight palette
and I'm going to use this gold is shade
here now I'm seriously obsessed with
this at the man
and I honestly have been using this
cycle with a higher rated E and like
hadoken boots and it's only 10 pounds I
got gifted this with something I bought
online
and then honestly is so good so this is
just a luxe highlight brush by a zoeva
and I think this brush was only like six
pounds or something and their brushes
are like so good so yeah I'm just gonna
buy this to my cheekbones the end of my
nose keep his bow I don't say my brow
bone now I'm still using my medium
sweeper e54 brush by Sigma I'm gonna pry
the highlight to my brow bone because
why not
so I'm going to apply this to my inner
corner as well highlight my inner corner
I'm going in with it girls night from
the planet
I'm just gonna apply this to my under
eye
okay then I was going to go read my
mascara I'm just gonna apply these to my
bottom eyelashes
I always put the weirdest face when I do
my mascara I think everything does to
either oh this is the blush brush by
Real Techniques and I'm using the Sigma
called DeRosa or a powder um I find it
really hard like you go with me notice I
don't really tend to use much brushes
and the reason why is because I honestly
never find any that I really like the
color on recently I kind of got this one
and it's like really impressed very you
love this color it's kind of like grease
at all not too much finally for lips I'm
going to take the eraser liquid lipstick
in raisi
and it's also this look also looks
really good with Iman to Nick Montenegro
I think that's how you say it and I have
that one as well and this looks just as
good with that lipstick but I'm gonna go
for new today
okay so lastly I'm going to take my mac
fix+ I'm just going to spray this over
my face just to get rid of any excess
powder and also just to hydrate my face
a little bit is I'm just going to
quickly straighten my hair my hair is
actually growing so much lately it's
crazy it used to be so sure but it's
actually growing quite a lot it's such a
frizzy mess I've just bagged honey there
but Herricks enters when I would like
long hair I use the beauty wax clip-ins
because I have two beauty works and pre
bonded and then beauty work has gifted
me with the clippings as well a lot
honestly were so happy with them like
they're thick soft dish i Nene and I
used to use the Bellamy's the Bellamy's
are good but price-wise if you want some
that are just as good then go for the BB
works because they're just as good as
the Bellamy's if not I'd say like a tiny
bit better and the price is just like
ridiculously better so like who's been
watching on the celebrity because I'm
loving Vicki I think Vicki should win I
actually love her and I love fern as
well so yeah let me know what you think
about that if you're watching it and
ladies say oh my god what a nightmare
she is such a bitch wasn't she
okay so last thing I'm gonna just take
the beauty where it's high shine spray
it's gonna spray this in my head to make
it shiny it's really nice this Duffing
it was so good
I'm a huge fan of beauty wax honestly
I'm I'm not just saying that because
they send me free stuff honestly you
need to try them
I enjoyed this video let me know what
you want to see next
as well Irene will know I might do the
video about house and your Instagram
followers and just talk you guys through
how I managed to get my followers up
