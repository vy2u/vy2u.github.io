fit me concealer and I'm just neaten up
my eyebrows
now I'm just adding some tape I'm just
to keep it nice and neat and I'm just
applying some primer to my eye which is
the Mac Paint Pot in painterly now I'm
going to create a cut crease so I'm just
using a pencil brush and this is a dark
concealer and I'm just making a line
from the inner corner of my eye to the
outer corner of my eye into my crease it
doesn't have to be really really neat at
this point because I'm going to blend it
upwards
right now I'm just going to blend this
upward so it's not so much of a harsh
line
now I'm going back in with this pencil
brush and I'm just going to try and make
it as neat as I can and again I'm just
blending that upwards now taking my
Sigma e35 brush I'm using shade peanut
butter from the semi-sweet chocolate
palette and I'm just using this as my
transition color now I'm taking a
blending brush and shade truffled from
the same palette and I'm just adding
this to the outer corner of my eye to
add more depth and then blending that in
with my e35 brush now I'm using an
eyeliner brush and I'm using the mary
lou manizer which is a highlighter and
I'm just trying to make this as neat as
I possibly can over my eyelid and this
brush works really well for me because
it would just makes it look really neat
and now I'm just going in with my angled
brush and my Maybelline gel eyeliner to
create a winged eyeliner and I just
realized I said eyeliner about 50 times
so yeah
eyeliner now I'm going in with my Max
Factor mascara and I'm just applying
some mascara before I apply my false
eyelashes and then once I've applied my
false eyelashes I'm just going to add
some more mascara to blend them together
now I'm using Smashbox photo finish
foundation primer in lights I've got
super super oily skin at the moment and
this is great if you've got oily skin so
for foundation today i'm using the
l'oreal true match foundation this is
really really good it's such a good
price and it's a lot like the Mac Studio
Fix but I actually do prefer this one
and I'm just buffing that into my skin
with my buffing brush by zoeva
drop
now I'm just using the Maybelline fit me
concealer so you can seal under my eyes
and also to highlight down the bridge of
my nose a little bit of my forehead and
my Cupid's bow I do really love this
concealer at the moment because again it
is such a great price and it's a lot
like than ours
I think it's called radiant concealer
and it's a lot like that and it's really
really good coverage so definitely a
huge fan of this concealer and I'm just
blending this in now using a damp Beauty
Blender
so I'm now going to bake my face so I've
just dipped my beauty blender in my
setting powder by Mac and I'm just
applying this to the concealed areas to
set my face
and I'm not just taking this brush and
brushing away any excess powder
now using a fluffy angled brush I'm just
going to add some contour because if you
know me I love to contour and this is
just the ABH contour kit and this is
shade cinnamon now I'm taking it all
over shader brush which is an eye brush
but I'm going to use it to highlights
and this is the mary lou manizer which
is my favorite highlighter at the moment
now for my lips I'm using the Mac spice
lip liner my favorite lip liner of all
time and as you can see it's running out
so I definitely need to go and get it
again so yeah I'm just lining my lips
with this and also filling them in I
will link below all the products that
I've used and also where you can get
them from so yeah I will also link my
Instagram and my twisted below so if you
want to follow me on there please do and
