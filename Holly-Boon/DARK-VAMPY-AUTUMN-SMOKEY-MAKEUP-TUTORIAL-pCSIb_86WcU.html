youtube channel or if you're new here
it's nice to meet me across the internet
so today I thought I would film a really
vampy or to me makeup look and just like
burgundies and purples and smoking on I
live for these kind of looks and I hold
on a dark lip and I don't even know how
long
so yeah before we get started please
subscribe to my youtube channel I love
you forever and ever
yeah if we're to find out how i got this
makeup look then please keep watching so
first of all I'm going to take this
shade right here which is Peach Smoothie
from makeup geek and I'm going to use
this iconic London fluffy brush I'm just
running this back for some for just
above the crease next from makeup geek
I'm going to take this shade which is a
bit so when you use this like a flat
brush from iconic London I'm kind of
gonna press this shade in and I'm gonna
bring it all the way in my crease and
then all the way to the outer corner as
well so the moment we just want to Pat
the color on doesn't need to be super
neat
cuz we're gonna bend the edges anyway
you just want to pack on this color I've
got my new lens but I haven't got my new
actual camera and for some reason it
just doesn't want to turn on which is
great so this is the new lens it's
actually really really good and it's
really let seem like so much more light
and it's like just so much more detail
like you can literally see everything so
I'm just going back to the shade Peach
Smoothie on this fluffy brush I'm going
to blend the edges going back to that
shade bitten I'm gonna do the same thing
again so pack on the color and then
we're gonna blend out the edges just
press in that in like that and then
again taking this fluffy brush just
gonna lightly blend the edges I'm so
happy with this lens interesting so much
better you can actually see everything I
felt it with the other one it's like it
kind of makes it a bit blurry you can't
really see like it's not sharp this is
like sick
so next I'm going to take this shade
right here which is good seduction and I
think this one is from morphe and then
I'm going to use this iconic London it
kind of like a dense and good brush and
again I'm going to just pack the product
on with this shade I'm only going to
apply it to the outer corner of the eye
to about half way again to press this
shade and I like to press the product
rather than rum sometimes because you
just get way more color payoff with that
brush that I used for the shape bitten
I'm gonna just go over the edges
basically run this brush over that edge
just to really kind of soften that
don't worry about making a mess here
because we're going to clean up anyway
so just bring the product all the way
ups to make sure it's it's seamless next
I'm gonna take the show corrupt from
makeup geek this is black shadow just to
smoke out the outer corner of my eye and
I'm gonna take this really dense iconic
London bright I did actually just film
this part and then I put way too much
black on and from like a smoky eye to
being punched in the eye so I
had to take it off sighs but yeah I'm
just gonna put the tiniest bit of this
in the outer part of the eye and keep it
quite low when you're using black the
best thing to do is to apply a tiny bit
at a time because you can always just a
little bit more if you need I'm going to
use my morphe concealer in the shade
nude I'm going to use this to carve out
my crease its concealer is gonna be so
good if you have oily lids because a
little bit dry and if you find that like
your eyeliner transfers and you don't
know what to do try a different base
because the other day I applied a
concealer the NARS radiant creamy
concealer as a shallow base and wear
eyeliner kept transferred I didn't know
why I was like what is going on because
like the eyeliner was the same one that
I use all the time and then I changed
the concealer and I was like oh okay it
was the base that was making it that
happened so if you have that same
problem trying to base I recommend this
morphe concealer as a base because it's
like I said it's quite dry so if you
have all your lids it's really really
good for that also Mac soft ochre Paint
Pot is it goes well I find that quite
dry and sometimes if you have dry days
don't use those ones because they're
going to be they're going to look flaky
and we
concealer I thought let's fly it I don't
know you have to set it I haven't used
this concealer under my eyes and I
probably won't
I love the coverage of it but I just
feel like it's like I said it's quite
dry so I don't but I could be good for
under-eye pre-creased on am using my
Sigma F 70 concealer brush and when I
get to this middle part I'm just gonna
kind of pull out the edge so that so I'm
going to take this pressed pigment from
morphe in the shade five star luxury and
I'm going to apply this bit on top of
where just applied the concealer and am
using that same brush so means that
Sigma concealer assembly brush X I'm
going to take this la splash liquid
liner and this is a waterproof liquid
liner it's really good like this eyes
blended so much nice tile don't you know
what's going on over here but it's been
annoying me
when I apply some false lashes and first
I'm just gonna apply some mascara to my
lashes I'm using the Maybelline the big
shots curl the lashes I'm using other
Koko lashes in the style and more so
first we're gonna take this wire sow or
ours primer I was just sent this in the
mail and I really want to see if it's
worth the price okay so in regards to
how it feels on the skin and it feels
like any other prime not being
completely honest it's a fun way
foundation today I'm going to use the
Maybelline fit me matte poreless and I'm
gonna mix these two shades together I'm
gonna mix the shade 220 and the shade
330 I just feel like I only put a tiny
bit of 330 exits of dark and I do mostly
220 but um yeah I just think mixed
together it's a better shade yeah if
you're oily like me you'll love this
foundation it's that but it's not super
matte that makes sense it's not like to
the point where it feels really dry it's
so hard for with natural daylight in the
UK because they'll be one minute where
the Sun will be out and it would be like
really nice light in and then the Sun
will go behind the clouds and it'll be
cloudy and then it will just go dark
same while I Tim because I do use mainly
natural daylight in the ladies room
light and see how my lighting kinda goes
in and out sometimes it's like like
restaurants do I feel so yeah that's
very about that
let me take my benefit boying
brightening concealer to correct my dark
circles under my eyes I really like
those iconic London Eye brushes I prefer
this face brushes being honest I feel
like the eye brushes they need more
fluffy brushes and not of them are quite
dense and but yeah the quality of the
brushes are really good and I'm I'm like
really impressed with them fer this
brightening corrector makes so much
difference when I applies under I can
see you know it just really helps to
brighten it up and not look ashy because
sometimes my dark side was up worse than
other days and some days I'm like if I
don't
correct then and I just apply concealer
it will look really ashy and I just yeah
not about that life
next I'm going to take my NARS radiant
creamy concealer in the shade ginger I
love that I can now hold products up to
this cleanse and it focuses like really
quickly and then I'm just going to apply
some here and my chin and then round the
sides of my nose I get quite a bit of
redness there so I'm gonna leave my
concealer to dry for a minute just to
get more coverage and in the meantime
I'm going to snatch my nose I'm gonna
first I'm gonna take my morphe you can
see that in the shade nude and I'm gonna
just run this down and then I'm gonna
press this end with my 3d render I'm
just gonna press in those sides I'm
going to use my iconic London cream a
contour palette I'm gonna take this
shade right here to snatch my nice and
I'm gonna use this on my Sigma F 70
concealer brush I'm going to bring it
down the sides and all the way down to
the end of my nose
and then I'm gonna round off the end and
when I apply some depend when I was
there I think my nose okay sure now I'm
just going to press in the concealer
now we're going to bend in the nose and
I'm gonna just pinch the sponge and
press it in because you really want to
keep the pride way put out so you're
just gonna gently press it in so I'm
taking a separate sponge better just
apply some powder and the reason the
copper effects powder in the shade light
don't you put my wife on with this
powder you do not bring it in because it
is like I've braved it in so many times
and milla oh my god
so next I'm gonna use this Stila bronzer
in the shade dark okay so I'm going to
finish off my eyes our face we're taking
the show Peach Smoothie on this fluffy
brush I'm gonna run that underneath next
I'm going to take that shade bitten next
I'm taking that shade seduction then I'm
going to take my Maybelline jaw line up
and in black and I'm gonna apply it in
the water I'm gonna kind of bring it
down just below the waterline as well
but they go to apply some mascara to my
bottom lashes and we're gonna use the
Mac extend your payment's camera next
I'm gonna highlight I'm gonna take the
door get a gilded honey highlight and
I'm gonna use this fan brush from the
iconic London brushes so for my lip I'm
going to take this NYX swag lip liner
and shape into it with a liquid lipstick
I'm going to use the dose of colors
