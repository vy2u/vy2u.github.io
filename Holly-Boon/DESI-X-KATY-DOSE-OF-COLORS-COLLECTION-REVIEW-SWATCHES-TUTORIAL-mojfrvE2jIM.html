youtube channel if you're new here my
name is Holly Boone it's nice to meet
you nice to eat meet you I send all the
time three in line so I'm going
to do I did this tutorial using the desi
and Katie caption my dose of colors so
before we crack on with that I'm going
to show you the products and usually
swatches and some like that so you guys
can see what they look like and show you
the packaging and all of that kind of
 so yeah I'm going to start with the
eye shadow palette so the eye shadow
palette comes in this beautiful
packaging like I am also so dispatched
into the point where I need this just
start on my dressing table because it
just looks like it just needs to be on
shy of 24/7 you know I mean I just think
it just looks so expensive it's so
glamorous
it's just packaging is everything and
this is amazing so I'm sure probably
show so when you get the eyeshadow
palette you get this little piece of
card that tells you which ones you need
to use where and which ones you start
and how to use the for how to use the
formula which i think is really good so
it says to use two of these shades wet
and choose always the choice of your
finger and that's what I did and it
gives amazing payoff and yeah love it
and also I did use dish because I used
to shade Sue's on my lips and I did use
some of that shade on the brush and it's
just a super indeed when you use a brush
if you use it wet and you just get more
fallout which I don't mind if I do my
makeup first so yeah here are the shades
so this is the shade Sue's then you've
got Noli harpoon and it turbulence so
I'm going to swatch these on my race and
show you what they look like a two
shades that you need to use wet are
Sue's and harpoon which is this show and
this shade so I'm just going to let my
thing and swatches on from my row so you
guys can see here is the shade soothe
and here is the shade harpoon
so Sue's is a really nice light gold
it's just gorgeous about the shade would
go of literally any look that you want
to put on your eye it's just so gorgeous
and then this shade harpoon is just a
beautiful I've never seen a show that is
on my life it's like a greeny gold it's
like a bullet it's more like a gray
green and it's got like a reflective
goals as you can see
as I move on reset that you can see that
it reflects gold and it's just stunnin
like that that shade is niches to die
for so I can't wait to use that color
our to show you can use drives and we're
swatches ones now to the shade no Lee
and Tabassum
so this bronzer gold shade right here is
called no Lee this shade is literally
the perfect bronze eagle if not too
yellowy it's just not too dark I think
it's a really really good good shade
lycoming it's a perfect shade and then
you've got this shade right here which
is turbo-san
which is like this really gorgeous
purpley shade so they're so pigmented
they're so creamy
they're just everything that you'd want
in a foiled eyeshadows the green gold is
such a unique shade of that you've never
seen that shade in my life next I'm
going to swatch the lip colors so you've
got two nude lipsticks the packaging is
to die for
it is gorgeous news with the rose gold
and you've got the rose gold dose of
colors and then on the actual package in
the box it comes in is this is really
nice rose gold and you put desi and lost
and lacks Katie's signatures on the side
which i think is a really really nice
touch so here are the two nude shades so
this one is called more cream appears
and this one is in the shade no shade
and this one is more of a pinky nude and
this one's more of a true nude if that
makes sense a katroo brown a little bit
of peachy undertone I use the two
combined so I put this one on and
indifferent instead of will it and I
love the two combined so I think they
went really well together so these are
the two new J's and then next you've got
these two matte liquid lipsticks so
we've got to show you hot fire and the
shade savage again is this gorgeous nude
packages of rose gold so this one isn't
she hot fire which is like a really nice
bright coral bread it's literally unreal
like I love the shade I think this shade
of really bronze your skin lozano to
highlight a minimal eye makeup would
looks literally foot on the nose which
is on holiday like this color is so
bunyan
and then this shade sahaj which is deep
like Moroney purple shade which is like
again on Rue at leisure to statement
colors I think I'm really really good to
have in a kit okay so next we have these
the to highlight
which are again in is absolutely amazing
package in which our estimate I keep
doing this kind of disgrace and I'm like
so the energy shades so way go is more
like a champagne e gold and then I feel
like mirror me is more like a rose gold
but they're both so buttery and so
creamy and so nice to use like I've got
Fuego on right now as you can see it
just looks so stunning and I have no
kind of me but I liquid glow underneath
if I have no liquid glow underneath just
this highlight and it just looks so
pretty and not powdery on the skin and
not glittery it's just Disick's gorgeous
I'm going to switch the point you can
see okay so here we go so this one is in
Fuego and this one is in Mira mere so
this one's more of a rose gold and this
one's more like a champagne e gold but
they're both so gorgeous and so creamy
so last but not least we have this glass
which is so gorgeous the packaging for
one I just love love love the packaging
it's like a clear glass it's got some
flecks of gold in it it's so stunning
I've got on at the moment just switched
it on my hands and you can kind of see
it's like a clear glass with that like
reflects of gold in it and it's lit
she's stunning like it's just the
perfect glass and in the sunlight it
just kind of like glistens it just looks
so so amazing like I am just like
obsessed
I knew this collection was going to be
born because it's them - its desi and
Katie and all motifs of them I just
think they're so Sun in some ways that
make up so I didn't expect anything less
to be honest then bomb as products
so I'm really happy with this one as I
think they're so worth it so worth the
money if you didn't manage to get them
this time I think they're relaunching
them so make sure you get your hands on
them because they are statement pieces
and they're so so so so so so nice so I
definitely definitely recommend you get
in them and yeah that is all the
swatches if you want to find out how I
did this makeup look then keep watching
and make sure to subscribe and give this
video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it so
far and I want to find out how did this
it expand it please keep watching so I'm
going to be using my naked heat color so
first of all mime activity for I'm going
to take the show source and I'm going to
apply this shade in the crease and just
above the grease this palette is super
pigmented and really bendable like
really easy to blend the shades together
I also love the shade that's right you
can never have too many warm pallets and
yeah I'm shocked because I never liked
the other naked palettes and really
wasn't a fan ever looking really up
their game with this one so next on my
morphe M 504 brush and we take this edge
right here which is called double G
double yes whew devil and I'm going to
apply this shade to the outer corner of
my eyes just place the product here and
then I'm going to bring it up into the
crease but only needs about halfway if
you guys like me on snapchat you'll know
I already filmed a tutorial once and I
went to edit it and I realized my face
makeup was a hot mess
I don't know what I did or what I did
differently but my it was like my
under-eye was so bright I look stupid
and it wasn't even blended in properly
just things so bad and I'm such a
perfectionist when it comes to multi
tours ever want to make sure that you
guys you know I want to go for that
really good quality content so I yeah
some refill in this video now but yeah
some people don't mind mistakes in
videos and when it comes to that but I
didn't even pick up on it in the video
so I didn't even speak on how I've made
the mistake and so I just thought it was
really like it look like I wanted it to
knit that way I like them I've placed my
room light up and over the camera and I
think the light looks so much better
sometimes I think my light is really
dull and it can make me look for it
makes me it really saturated I don't
know why and they mean it really orange
so I've placed the room light up high
and I think it definitely looks better
from what I can see in there anywhere on
CS I'm just going back to the shade and
sauce to blend in that shade those two
shades together then using the same
brush and we take this shade right here
which is in fluid or it's illegal and
I'm going to deepen up the outer corner
so I'm just going to apply this shade on
top of where I applied the other one to
deepen it up
I want to get better light in like if
anybody knows how you get a spotlight
assisted before but no I still don't
know how to do it and how to get out a
spotlight on your backdrop and what
lighting equipment I need to that if
anybody knows then can you let me know
because I said this before graph and I
still didn't find out so I still right
now I said I have to do that what I
really like the way that looks in
people's videos so in the palette I'm
going to use this shade right here which
is called soos and this is the shade you
have to use wet so I'm going to wet my
finger and apply this with my finger to
my lid apply this on the lid this is so
pigmented these shadows it's so nice
and then because I've got nails and I
can't get in the inner corner I'm going
to use my brush but I'm going to wet the
brush so I'm just using my Sigma
concealer brush and I'm gonna slide the
brush it works I think it works just as
well with a brush you just get less
fallout if you use your finger I think
your waist just as well the brush okay
so I'm bringing this forward shadow to
of that halfway and I'm going to lightly
try and just pull and put out a little
bit and I'm going to blend in and I take
my morphe M 506 I'm going to take the
shade in for angle and then I keep
saying like that and I'm just going to
blend out the edges so yeah if you fire
your thing that you get less fallout if
you apply with the brush like I'm going
to dip my brush into some water and then
apply the brush is just as pigmented it
just you get way more fallout that's
anything but I don't have up all that
cuz I always in wet eye makeup first
anyway so I don't really care
next I'm going to take my Maybelline gel
liner and I'm going to take my ear six
winged liner brush from Sigma and I'm
just going to line my lash line before I
put my lashes on because it will just
really helps to blend my false lashes in
okay so just ducks and lashes off camera
I can't remember the name of these ones
because I've won a few times and then
just in my little eyelash box so I can't
remember the name but if I do remember I
will link them below so I'm going to
start on my face so my makeup is pretty
much finished adjusting to finish it
under eye but we're going to do two
things first
so I'm going to start off by priming my
skin I'm going to use the marker Jacobs
remark or primer releasing this a lot
lately it really makes my skin feel
super hydrated and really smooth and for
makeup application so I do really like
it and then I'm going to use some of
that angel veil by NYX I'm gonna use it
in the center of my face really have
some smooth out pores I find and it's a
little bit matte I feel like and that I
find me a little bit so it's good for my
tears actually or you I'm going to mix
two foundations because I like the shark
to Bri and magic foundation I'll just
bracket a little bit to yellow and even
though when I do do my concealer and
bronzer it does doing it quite nice but
I just want to mix it a tiny bit of this
one which is the Too Faced Born This Way
in the shade golden just so then when I
first apply it it's the right color okay
so I'm going to apply the foundation
using my sponge this is from Sigma 3d
been done oh my god so the other day I
was in the program and it's called close
cause and it's about like people that
have had like accidents and that nearly
died near misses if that makes sense and
there's some fucked-up stuff and there's
like so many things I will not go on
it's like varicosities that went wrong
there's this girl and this boy and
they're on holiday dates and they go on
one of these boats with the like
parachute thing at the back I don't know
if that's what it's called but you know
the one do you know what I mean like
when you guys I see and it's like is it
Paris aliens I don't know anyway they're
like up in the air like so high and it's
like the weather changes and the weather
starts getting really bad and then the
thing snaps and then like going off in
the air and they land somewhere time
feeling like they love you they don't
die but
it was a Kinnear miss they were like
that close to like news electric cables
it was so goose I thought so I
never gonna want to Evan let me tell you
I wouldn't anyway come together PI it
but that's definitely put me off I just
think these things are so like garlic
fairground wires like you never catch me
going on fairground wise because they
put them together II like one
day like how know how I trust it I do
not trust it I know thanks I also saw
one time on YouTube and it was like I
mean you've been trying her or something
it was like oh you look like a
fairground wise and then this guy's
seatbelt thing didn't work properly and
ride with up and he cheap fell out and
flew out and saying and I was like a
lazy died or anything but you'll never
catch me number I don't know even at
theme parks I don't like rides not after
all that out and Towers no
thank you
no thanks he'll snow then I hope
you can enjoy them like I mean I let me
give you an adrenaline rush and all that
but your life is more important than
that anyway so I'm going to take my
benefit boink concealer to brighten my
under-eye excite a little bit of dark
circles going on today so I'm using the
Sigma concealer f70 brush I'm just going
to put a tiny bit of this into my eyes
before I apply my concealer I really
like this product for brightening up
under-eye I feel like it really works
really work to get rid of those dark
circles and it prevents your concealer
lookin Greg so concealer can look ashy
if you apply it on top of dark circles
so it's best to correct the dark circles
before you apply the concealer because
it will just look so much nice and it
won't look at ashy
nobody was ashy concealer let's be
honest let's just be honest let's just
be real
okay so I'm going to take my do Mabley
the arrays eye concealer in the shade
nude
I do like that and the amazing cover
concealer or as cool amazing concealer I
do really like that product a little bit
goes a long way with that because it's
so full coverage and it will create if
you applied too much of it but I feel
like I got the wrong shade like it's too
a little bit too pinky for me okay so
I'm going to leave my numbers alone so I
can see here because I'm going to use it
in products at my nose so I'm just going
to blend it in it with my 3d blender
yeah so in the last time I put fill in
this video I put through like Hello
concealer under my eyes and it was
really bright I just looked so mad so I
was like um let's delete that video is
that again okay taking a separate sponge
I'm going to bake my under-eye and when
you use a two-faced Born This Way powder
and we gon bake that cake I don't know
what was your stupid like voices I wish
you see the voices it's really and we'll
bake much him because we all know if I
don't people can be like why did you
highlight your chin and ugly bitch I
didn't highlight my chin okay I'm
audience but okay so I'm going to snatch
my nose so I'm going to first of all
give some more features in the shade
nude so I'm going to file it down the
front of my nose and then the tiny bit
on the end like that I take my 3d Brenda
and I'm going to press the product in
but I don't want to move too much you
wanna press because you don't want it to
move you want the product to be exactly
where you put it I really struggle with
nose console and I found something that
works for me now so I'm going to share
it with you all I find using powders
might 90% of the time it looks like I
have a muddy nose so I've decided to
start using cream contour when I and it
looks so much better I'm going to use my
cream contour kit from iconic London
this one is so creamy and so easy to
blend in so that's why I think it works
really really well for the nose
and it's been working for me really well
so I'm going to use this shade right
here I'm going to take this morphe brush
which is the m3 and this is from the
Brittany bear collection with morphe
which I'm obsessed with I love this
brush I think it's so perfect for a nice
contour it's really thin and easy to use
so I'm going to take that shade from the
iconic palette and I'm just going to run
this down the size of Windows I'm going
to bring it all the way down to the end
of my nose and then I'll show you what I
do to the end of my nose after them I
will say bring it all the way up to my
eyebrows laughs that really works to
blend it when you blend it out it looks
more seamless okay then the end of my
nose I just like to round it off so just
arrive at the end like that and then I
also have to apply some under my nose
just here because it makes my nose
appear sure and then if you really want
to but them know that button nose look
you can draw a line there and it will
make the ends look more lifted but today
I'm going to do that and leave it like
that it time with 3d blender and just
press the product in you want to make
sure you press the rub because like I
said you don't want the product to move
you really want to stay where you put it
so I'm just literally going to press
this in if you're looking for a good
cream contour and highlight I read your
recommenders iconic London one it's
really creamy I'm really really easy to
blend in like I find this song creams is
like once you lay them down they become
that quite stiff and it's a really hard
silicon right blend in where this one's
like super creamy so it's been working
so well from my nose contour then take
my sponge which I use for the powder and
I'm just going to bake down the sides of
my nose paint on surgical nature
what you say yes I'm just going to toss
up this title of my chin I am going to
leave that fate there for a minute
whilst I bronze up my face and I'm going
to be using my Stila stay all day
contour and bronzer in the shade dark
and I'm going to apply this using my Mac
140s brush I
love this brush for applying a bronze
light it works really well I like this I
like a big fluffy fan brushing away it
is that wreath dense I'll come to all
that oh hey that's five finger foreheads
can you just set the piston fit that I
mean it's cool having a big forehead a
nice light shut up okay see I'm just
gonna apply some this to my cheekbones
just underneath my cheek man let me see
here
nobody back in ever I really loved this
second part it really seems that my
under eyes you'll see in a minute but
and I used it when I went to Manchester
because I'd used it once and I was like
not sure about it just because I felt
like it gave me such back but then I
realized because I baked him did the
same thing again when it's Manchester
and I took a picture of Flash and it
didn't look it didn't give me suspect so
I think what it was in time before is I
pre left a tiny bit of powder residue my
face about really under hand dusted it
off properly and that's really why I
look like I had flashbacks it was only
in like the tiny little area I was like
just under my eye had a little bit of
flashback but the second time it didn't
happen so I think it was my fault and I
am just going to bake under here sweeten
it up I'm going to do a little baked
under there I take sauce first of all
from this palette so the color that you
use festival my transition color on my
Mac two to four I'm going to stuff this
under my iron and taking my morphe m56
I'm going to need to say hue devil and
then I'm going to use a little bit of
the shade and throw a go for my
waterline I'm going to use a white liner
and this one from NYX is so creamy and
so why I like so pigmented
I really love this so this is just yeah
the Knicks a Knicks twisty line art in
white bit of pink on inland lands and
with you
then I'm going to apply some the scribe
to my bottom lashes and reading the mark
extended playing scorer
Oh highlight and here are the two
highlighters so you've got this one
which is where you go and this one which
is mirror me so Emira me is more of like
a rose gold whereas this was more like a
champagne ii gold so i think for today
i'm going to go for a go and this on my
hair because if I get one I start with
my skin I'm just going to spray my face
with some of the Mario Badescu spray
first of all and I'm going to spray my
brush as well and this brush is the more
p.m. 510 so I'm going to bring it on my
cheekbones and then round it bring it
round my eyebrows as well I want it to
be like so Beaman we're just going to
keep filing but it's so pigmented it's
so beautiful on the skin it's kind of
like it really melts into the skin isn't
a powdery so I'm going to apply some of
this highlight to the inner corner of my
eyes and then I'm going to bring it down
the bridge of my nose and then just on
the tips as well and then I'm going to
applies the Cupid's bow and the brow
bone
so for the lip colors I'm going to try
them all on you can see what they all it
like on the lips so with some of these
two nude shades we've got this one right
here which is called no shade this one's
more of a like kinky nude and then this
one which is a more crema blue which is
a darker peachy a nude so yeah I'm going
to line my lips real quick okay so we're
going to try on the shade no shade no
shade the shade no shade Perceval okay
so this color is gorgeous I feel like
this is the lightest I could go in a
nude shade and but I really really
really love this nude I think it's so
pretty so that one is in the shade no
shade so the next nude is this one more
cream of Lee which is more of my kind of
effortless with work best of my skin
tone signal transfer on okay I think
that one it looks so much better than
the one before I do love them both but I
feel like the other one is best for the
center of my lip and this one looks
gorgeous all over the lip so next time
when I try all the two liquid lipstick
shades so the first one I'm going to try
on is hot fire which is a really bright
orange red which is stunning
Hey this one is nice this one is exactly
what's in the label hot fine yeah this
is so nice
besides that really nice orangey red
perfect for summer just beautiful I love
this especially when you put really good
Talon holiday like Rico is going like
this with it amazing I'm going to try
the shade savage which is this really
deep really purple so this is the shade
Salvage I'm living for this one as well
and I haven't wanted our clip in a hot
minute like this if you guys want to
film a tutorial for that clip let me
know just be like I actually call them
the last time I wore duct tape when I
used to wear dark it all the time as you
scroll back on my youtube channel I used
to wear dark lips all the time so like
dark purples and dark Browns and dark
reds all the time so then what happened
but yeah then we're going to use this
amazing glass so we're going to apply it
in the center of my lips so lastly to
finish off I'm going to spray my face
with the Urban Decay all nighter setting
