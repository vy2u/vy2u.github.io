youtube channel my name is hole Irina
for new hair so today I am showing you
how I got my lip filler dissolved I did
have some vlog footage before I got to
the clinic but for some reason my memory
card decided to delete it or not save it
or I don't know so I just thought I'd do
a little introduction and take a little
bit about why I want you to get them
dissolved and stuff so I have been
getting my top lip well both my lips
filled nor point-five probably two or
three times over the last two years I
haven't heard done that many times
people always think that I used to fill
my lips out all the time why I didn't at
all and but the second or third time I
got the top one done I can't remember
how many times but two or three anyway I
got the north point five in the top lip
and it was a bit too big and I was kind
of just waiting for it to go down and go
down and it never really went down so I
just was like I wanna get it dissolved
but I've heard it's like painful I'm
scared I don't know the procedure so I
just decided I need to get it dissolved
because I just think it looks so much
better smaller and always thought I did
get no-fee the lady that does my lips
and to just give you a little talk about
the procedure and just the importance of
going to a qualified nurse so also in
this video you're gonna see I get my
tear trough filled as well
I'm so happy with the result it's just
really smooth that my under eye I just
think it makes me look so much more
awake because I actually never sleep and
I always look so tired so I just think
it makes me look so much more awake I
got makeup on yes if you want to see the
procedure and just learn a little bit
more about how it works then please keep
watching and also I did the day after
two days after and then this is three
days after first time we've done this so
apologies if I'm not as as natural as as
Holly and I think Holly is a really good
example of somebody who understands the
need for a medical professional to be
delivering treatments not not only the
the cosmetic treatments but also when we
consider reversing the dermal
and that's something that we hope to do
in a few minutes time hyaluronidase is a
Putin enzyme and it's a prescription and
the item you know as a prescriber I've
had to write a prescription for Holly in
order for her to use this not acceptable
that people just just use it from from a
stock hood maybe in their fridge I will
be I've got strict guidelines that have
been written by complication experts
that I will be following today so I'll
be making sure a patch test Holly I'll
be making sure that you know I've got my
emergency bag near I know how to
administer adrenaline
I've got BLS I less-experienced so I
know how to respond in the event of an
emergency
it's rare but as a nurse I've got a
responsibility to look after
Holly's welfare and her safety as well
that's really important to me and and
then of course you know what we'll do
the procedure
Holly will be well aware of what can go
right what can go wrong nothing comes
risk-free and then I'll be sending her
home with a copy of her notes so that
should anything change when she leaves
me and she can go through a nearest
ayleid apartment and they have all my
documentation of who I am what I've done
what products I've used what doses I've
used and this is really the only safe
way to be considering dissolving and any
hyaluronic product please don't just
accept a low offer off somebody to do it
for you
your health is really important please
look at yourself
you can't sting a little bit how did you
find that like a yes
yeah tolerable
strange but hopefully okay yes technolon
I hear now the reason why we've used
this under the muscle did you find that
yeah it's great yes it is it's the
safest way of doing it yeah okay so we
will try and use a needle but can you
just see the difference between the
flatness that you'll get over there and
then it's just kind of keeping that
there I would never want to go right up
to your on it because you're meant to
have yet that curve there
otherwise you'd look like you're robots
of that character yeah nice so what I'm
going to do now is whilst I'm on this
Sun when I go over here a little bit of
volume locks yeah yeah along with some
it because I'll do that watch them on
this side and then we'll move over next
wise you can see a little bit of
swearing not too much them so I'm gonna
give you higher doses and see how we go
so sit up for me cause I want your
opinion on this as well okay let's have
a look so how I look in the mirror let
me show you what we've done you too much
tweeted all along this plane here look
I'm happy about yeah right in the corner
of your eyes can you see there's a
little very natural for your yeah for
your face you always have that jalapeno
since you 6 years old
so I'm gonna do keep you very still and
just go in there now yeah fingers
crossed from them nowhere near any of
you calories so you're not going to
bruise your caddy okay so we just got
back and just going to show you what my
lips it like so I've got a loads of
bruising at the moment as you can see
that over here and this side as well but
it's weeks I feel like this size gone
down already even though they're swollen
yeah I'll update you everything today on
what they look like so yeah this is what
they like at the moment okay stay number
twos I've what give you a little update
on my lipstick like so the top one
like she completely got on like I feel
like it's literally there's nothing left
in there and I loved the way it looked
something getting so much better
but then my bottom one is really smoking
at the moment and if it hurts a little
bit it's like really swollen and then
when under-eye is really smooth but
again it's a little bit smaller but I
don't think I like to read like I've
been punched in the mouth but it's all
good okay so this is day three I really
wanted to zoom right in so you guys
could see properly the results so as you
can see my top one has gone down
completely now it's literally I can't
put any more filler in there it's
literally completely gone if I lift this
up here you can see how far a big bruise
under there which is quite painful and
I've still got some bruising there and
the bottom one is still swollen at this
point I mean it kind of takes around two
weeks for my swelling to go down so I
did get a little bit of filled in just
there because I kind of had a lot of
filler there but nothing there and I
like having a big I like having a full
bottom lip I've always liked that so I
kept my bottom lip but just added a tiny
bit in the middle so yeah it's still
quite swollen and it's still quite
painful I like to touch it's quite
tender so yeah that will go down over
the next two weeks but I'm so happy with
the result of the top lip apart from the
bruise you know see and I think it makes
so much belt and then my under eye as
you can see I think it looked so much
better and it's so much more smooth and
I haven't got any bruising which is
crazy because I really thought I was
gonna get bruising but I haven't any
it's so smooth and he just first who's
nice and it looks so much better so I'm
really happy with that
yeah that is a result of me getting my
top filler dissolved and the tear trough
filler and I don't know if no-fee takes
on any more clients she has quite a
small client base I don't really think
she's taking on any new clients anytime
soon which is kind of annoying because
she's like the best person ever I would
highly recommend it to anyone
it's also worth message in her anyway
cuz she might take on new clients or she
might I don't know what she's doing so
I'll put her information in the
description box if you want to contact
her also if you have any worries or you
have anything that you want to ask or
just anything like that no fee is the
best person to she is so amazing and she
just she's just amazing what she does so
I highly recommend if you even want to
just talk to her about something or if
you've had a bad procedure any you don't
know what to do then know if he's the
best person to talk
I hope you guys enjoyed this video I
thought I'd share this little journey
with you just because I want you to make
sure that you guys are aware of the
importance of going to a qualified nurse
I just wanted to I'm just there's just
so much stuff that goes on in that whole
kind of filler world like you can go and
get your little and field for like no
money and just go to like someone random
it's just so dangerous so I just really
wanted to make this video and just let
you guys know if you do want to get any
procedures please please please go to
someone it's very very qualified and no
fee is inertia West of the NHS as well
as she does cuz make a procedure so
she's very aware of just everything and
she just has so many certificates she's
just so trains I just really want you
guys to make sure you go somewhere
really safe but anyway I hope you guys
