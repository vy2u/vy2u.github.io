channel I am Holly beam if they're new
here so today I thought I'd film a Q&amp;amp;A -
the first one is from Chloe Morello and
it says what was your MSN name so I
don't know what I actually can't
remember specifically what it was but I
think it was something like Holly dolly
or some some sort of cringy like
that like it was something so crude I
feel like everyone's MSN name was cringe
wasn't it did you have a cringy MSN name
then I don't even know okay and then
Corey said again what was your first
single that you bought actually cannot
remember my first single that I bought
but I remember the first album I bought
and it was a con it was a cons album I
can't remember I like what the album was
cool but it was the one that dragged up
they won't let me out and lonely you
know the world I don't even know haven't
him like what happened to me just
disability earth like combat your music
was poppin and Kylie cosmetics or fancy
beauty I'm going to say a bit of both I
do like certain things from both of them
how about you got the saintly foundation
on today see how good I won saying I
really really like it actually forgotten
much I liked it and then Kylie cause my
ex I do like some of the liquid
lipsticks some of the formulas are
different to the others which is really
strange for me but some of them I really
like so I just like a bit of both really
if you were to bring out your own makeup
range what products would you like to
make first okay as you guys know I am
actually working on my own brand and I
have been for so long because it's
always been a dream of mine and every
single penny I have to invest I have
been and I'm just gonna tell you okay
some things are so expensive to make it
just depends on your budget like what
you have and depend on what you can
release first to be honest it's just
yeah it just depends how much money you
have on what you can make first which
three fellow youtubers do you look up to
the most and there's so many like I love
so many youtubers i youtubers just
everything I love it I love seeing
people's talents I love seeing people's
personalities I just I just love it
and my three favorite youtubers at the
moment this changes all the time because
I let you watch I go three stages well I
like binge watch people and they're like
I don't have very little bit and then
I've been watch them again so I've seen
my three favorite youtubes at the minute
is Alfie and Zoe i watch their vlogs all
the time i'm says I also love
love-love-love blog Patrick Starr I
think he's amazing
I am obsessed with his looks and him and
Nicky Torres are in the club with the
Halloween Disney thing I was sure it's
just amazing I love Patrick Starr and
who else I haven't been watching at the
moment I love Shaunie agreement and
Michael Finch they just make me die
they're just so funny I love watching
them as well but yeah like I said I
binge watch people and the no don't
watch them from it and then I've been
watching it again no I do it all the
time what's your favorite time of year
are you a summer yell or winter yeah I'm
definitely a summer girl like I hate
being cold and I just hate the winter
honestly the only thing I like about
Wednesdays the fashion I love big coats
and I love the fashion in winter more
money in summer but first summer all day
every day what place do you want to
visit that you never have would you plan
a trip to the US for a meet and greet I
want to go to Greece I really want to go
to Mykonos I want to go to Santorini I
really want to travel the US as well
I've been to New York before but I
really want to see like LA I want to go
to like Las Vegas I just want to see
like Miami and what kind of stuff and
then I also really really really want to
go Maldives but I think I want to save
that for like if I get married and for
honeymoons you know I mean so it's hot
it really is go to Maldives
no but seriously like I really want to
go to Maldives for like a honeymoon
ideally if I get married see alcohol or
cocktail of choice okay I'm a wine
person I love one one
just everything wine I'm just obsessed
no Rosie is my favorite but I do like a
red somehow the third ever go from me
and then like I do like a bit of white
biographer of lemonade you know I mean
um and cocktail of choice has to be a
frozen strawberry daiquiri or warm and
it's a curry you ain't know about that
you need to try it
what's the best and worst purchase that
you've ever made I think best purchases
would be my teeth and when I got a boob
job because it gave me so much more
confidence I just love my teeth now I
love my boob and then the worst purchase
I've ever made was probably getting the
Bouton's
the pointy ones because I mean they just
sit under my bed of a woman once they
scoff on the like 600-pound pair of
shoes they scuff on the bottom after
you've worn one something they're made
for carpet and I actually made for you
to go outside but um I just I'm just
over them then she's heard a song called
it's award they're just not even worth
it honestly the only ones I have that I
do as she likes uncomfortable are I
think they're called lady peep they have
like a peep toe and they've got like a
platform and those are actually not that
bad they're actually quite comfy but the
pointy boobs if you thinking about
getting them don't even waste your money
honestly favorite horror film I'm not
gonna lie I'm a bit of a weirdo but I
really like a up film no I really
like watching people get murdered and
stuff like that sounds really bad but I
like watching crime things I like
watching horror films I'm a bit of a
sick guy I understand I'm a bit of a
sicko if you went on YouTube what do you
think you'd be doing right this moment I
honestly have no idea when I tell you I
was a lost person I was lost I was so
miserable I was so I don't know like I
was in a bad place I just had no idea of
what I wanted to do of my life I thought
YouTube saved me in a way you know in
pets or dogs dogs I'm sorry I'm sorry
dogs are so much more loving than cats I
had a cat and she just hated me like
this cat was evil like she literally
hated me and so I mean just put me off
cats for life honestly
literally put me off cats for life so
yeah
I'm so over cats what's the best makeup
brush sets to ask for Christmas and what
advice do you give to people for
motivation okay so for Christmas I would
recommend the Weaver brushes I feel
let's do weave or a Mac or Sigma the
best but Mac and Sigma are quite
expensive so definitely go for the
Weaver the brushes are just really
really good really well so definitely I
would recommend that and and what advice
do you give to people for motivation we
all have days I want to say this so I'm
gonna is gonna get real deep for a hot
minute okay so we all have days when we
feel like and we don't want to move
like we don't want to leave the house we
feel down we just struggle like we have
days where we struggle I I have days
where I literally climbing out myself
out of bed because I just feel so I put
a lot of pressure on myself look why I'm
very like you should be initially that
should be an issue and I do so March
sometimes I literally as soon as I stop
for a second I'm like so overwhelmed and
I'm so like I don't know I put a lot of
pressure on myself sometimes and I find
it very difficult to snap out of that
and say like I just feel like I haven't
got an idea for a YouTube video I will
stress myself out so bad because of like
I need to upload a video like I need to
you know think of something and as a
creative person sometimes I literally
have a creative block and I cannot think
of what to film I don't know what to do
I don't feel inspired it's just I don't
know it sometimes as a creative person
it can be a struggle
so for motivation I just tend to read
I've read a lot of books like if you
guys follow me on snapchat you know I
love a good motivational book I love a
good motivational speaker I will link
the books that I read below there are
quite a few over at about five or six
now and out of them about free I would
highly recommend reading they're just so
inspiring I just love hearing other
people's story like success stories and
how other people struggle to things cuz
then you feel like you're not the only
person because sometimes like I said
it's so much pressure on myself and I'm
like oh you should be doing this
you should be doing this you should be
in that and I'm like this I need to just
realize things take time nothing is
instant nothing you don't click your
fingers and stuff happens overnight like
this this stuff does take years
yeah are willing some books down below
some people that I've watched who do
motivational speeches on YouTube I just
think that honestly helps me so much
like as human beings is okay not to be
okay sometimes I know you pretty see
people preach my positive in you all the
time but it's impossible to be a
positive person a hundred percent of the
time sometimes you are gonna have days
where you feel down and you just feel
exhausted you feel drained mentally you
just don't you know there will be days
like that but you have to just not put
so much pressure on yourself things like
I said things take time
nothing's instant as long as you're
going forward and not backwards that's
all that you should care about you no
matter how long it takes as long as
you're going forward and not backwards
then that's all that matters
have you ever been taken for brands P
Allah forgive me and I get reviewing it
what do you think I have been taken off
your list I'm talking negative about
something but I don't care I don't they
haven't actually told me that whatever
the pianist but I've seen a lot of
people get into PR and it's not going to
me like I think it's because I said
something Shaylee about whatever I care
more about you guys and being on PR it's
okay you guys are what I care about my
main focus is you lot and I want to
connect of you on a level I want you to
feel like I'm relatable I want you to I
don't know I just want I didn't work out
about you guys I don't care about PR
list I don't care about free make I just
think if a commies gonna take you for PR
list for talking negative about a
product and they really just think care
about your opinion in the first place
because if they were really genuinely
cared about what you thought about their
products and they really wanted to know
not your opinion and you're like you
know they would take on board what you
say and you know try and better the
product so I just think if companies
take over PR list because you speak you
know not negatively but you just say you
know what could improve on what you
don't like about the product they
generally didn't care about you open it
in the first place you know what is your
dream car and do you get upset the
bitchiness in the industry causes you
not to want to go to fun brand events
and my dream car is probably an Audi r8
matte black I want to have about five
years so I'm definitely have more than
one day but anyway and do you get upset
I don't care honestly this bitchiness in
this industry is a joke
and honestly I'd rather spend my time
working on my career working on things
projects that I am trying to do and just
mainly focus on me unless you know
myself growing myself as a person trying
to put good quality content out I don't
use brands events it's nice network with
the Browse it's nice to meet the people
behind the brands it's really nice I
just don't get too wrapped up in that
sort of like it's literally like
playground behavior some of the stuff
that goes on in this industry and it's
just like come on we're not in school
we're school obviously you have to go to
school you have to learn I have a
decision I have a choice I do not have
to go to news events but I want to so I
don't if I genuinely want to meet the
people behind the brands I will arrange
to go for lunch with them and she's meet
them one-on-one and you know because I
do like to do that I do like to meet
that the people that work in the PR and
the people that work behind the scenes
and stuff at these brands so I do like
to meet them and I think it's really
good to network in that sense but I
won't go to these events because I don't
need to stand there and know that
somebody's talking talking about me over
the other sides of the rooms you know I
mean I'm really just know what's your
opinion on drama channels and shady
stuff that goes on in the beauty
industry
these drama channels I just don't
understand them like I just don't
understand why you would want to sit
there and be so negative about people
all the time like that's such a negative
energy you're just giving up this
negative energy and I just don't
understand why I would ever want to do
that if I see someone's doing well I'm
just like yeah bit shy you know I mean I
just think this time you jealous people
in this world and there's so many people
that just want to put everyone down at
the time and don't want to see people
succeed it's actually really sad I feel
like if there was more people that
actually like you know
boosted people are and you know we all
stuck together I think it would just be
so much better but no it's not like that
so you just have to ride your wave on
your own stay in your own lane do
thing and just let everyone get on what
would be a favorite take way to order
and what would be a favorite restaurant
to go out and eat and favorite take away
I don't even know I read about that on
what would be your favorite restaurants
going I love Italian food okay
pastor Pete cycle Zoey any for that yeah
I love Italian food so it has to be
somewhere Italian I do love precise I
think press is probably one of my
favorite places to go I need because
they do this really nice Paolo carbonara
it's unreal it's like a baked carbonara
our mother is over and then also they do
unreal
Caesar salad in there mmm okay what is
your cringy as makeup like you used to
do back hash tag back in the day I had
those like sperm eyebrows doing the ones
I mean there wasn't it I got those
sperms and your face like no bitch no
and I used the way slow wash mascara
that my ID she had three eyelashes so
like that they all just like stops to
give I like three eyelashes and then
used to wear dream up mousse and I were
to put it my fingers in it and I would
like to put all over my face like
there's and I'd put it over my lips and
then I'd get some lip gloss I think it
was from like collection mm um I could
clear glass and I used to just put that
all over my lips and I used to wear this
bourgeois blush and it was like really
pink and I would have like proper pink
cheeks and I feel like everybody used to
wear white eyeshadow and then it as well
like if you want actually white on your
eyes I don't even know why white
eyeliner it was something like that
that was the worst makeup ever I don't
even know why I thought that was okay
but then everybody did it so it was just
a thing you know yeah it was bad day I
feel like you know what this intense
highlight trend and do you feel like I
can like maybe ten years we're gonna
look back and be like oh my god you and
whatever you just put that extreme
higher on the face like you know I mean
I feel like it's gonna be one of them
okay will you ever daily vlog I really
want to say you vlog
I'm gonna wait till I move out and
because at the moment one I have so much
going on and it's like not even excited
and there's a lot of stuff like I can't
show you anyways so in sight if I daily
vlog I feel like I wouldn't be able to
do March and it would put him a bit
boring so I am gonna wait until I
actually move out at the moment I just
live in this tiny little room
it stresses me out when I wait till I
move out and I have a house and stuff
and then I probably will not daily vlog
but I want to do vlog so I probably want
to do vlogs but I just want to wait
until I'm set all in my own house and
stuff and then I feel like it would be
easier for me to vlog because I live in
an ounce of quite a few people and it's
like it's a lot you know
okay so favorite sweets I love my panic
obsess they like my fave I always say we
like round trees randoms is that what
they're called I actually loved them I
really liked the squishy ones I able to
go inside and I get really annoyed when
like I buy someone and they know how
many and now I'm like you have to go buy
another bike it would you ever move to
the USA I wouldn't move to the USA I'm a
UK girl for life like I am a UK girl for
life I know I'm worried about the UK
others home I do mind about here but I
do love lip vanilla I do love the UK I
just don't like the weather I feel like
I would write down like a little holiday
home when I can little apartment in
Spain somewhere I love Spain and I'm
Spanish food I love Spanish people I
love the weather I just love everything
about it like I love Spain so much okay
