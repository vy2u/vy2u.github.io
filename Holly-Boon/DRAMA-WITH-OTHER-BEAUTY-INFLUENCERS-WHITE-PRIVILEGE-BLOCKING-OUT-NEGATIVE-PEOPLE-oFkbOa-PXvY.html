channel and hello if you're new here
welcome hi my name is Holly Boone so in
today's video I thought we'd do a Q&amp;amp;A I
haven't done one of these in a while and
I just feel like I want to sit down and
talk to you all I feel like getting
these videos you get to know me a little
bit better as well which is obviously
good first question is how come we don't
go to beauty event slash trips you're
amazing so I bet you get invited to lots
but never see you on them
is it because of the beauty community
not being nice what is the reason I'm so
intrigued and it's not because the
beauty community isn't nice like it's
not that at all I've met so many feet
you influences are so lovely and really
really sweet Hanna Renee's definite one
of my favorites she's just such a
sweetheart
I had a slightly bad experience once
where I just felt really uncomfortable I
just felt like it was almost like at
school when there was like the popular
group in like the outcast it was a bit
like that little bit creepy and I just
felt a bit uncomfortable and I was
getting looks of certain people and it
just made me not like not wanna go oh
like it made me as a no but part of me
wants to go out like I do want to go
because I just want to meet more people
that do the same thing as me and I want
to connect with people like that and I
do want to go but I just have this thing
know where I'm like scared like I would
say like - like brands would be like oh
let you come in to event and I'm right
yeah I'm kind and the day before black I
just can't go out I just can't do it I
don't know what it is it's really weird
and I think once you've had it a bit of
an awkward or bad situation it's hard to
then overcome that do you know I mean
and I think that might be the problem
but also because the events are always
sort of like in London I'm not in London
like I'm 40 minutes run away like I'm
not far but I feel like when you go to
events it almost takes up like your
whole day so I have a lot going on here
and I'm not going on like that I'm doing
off of YouTube and obviously my youtube
so that's kind of my main focus at the
moment it's just putting up content for
you guys and also working on what I'm
doing so events is kind of like I don't
know Iraq they pop up at the wrong times
sometimes hi Holly
literally love you my great
yes how did you get over the boolean
people gave you after what you've done
onto air ages ago
um I fucking deserves every single thing
that everyone said to me like I fully
know that like I know that I wrote some
fucked up shit like I wrote some pretty
bad things
I was very uneducated she had ignorant
white person like that just didn't
realize my privilege as a white person I
deserved all of it like there's no like
everything that people were saying to me
I was like I agree with you like I know
like I hundreds in every of you and if
it was somebody else and I've seen it as
as somebody else
and I would feel the same way as
everybody else was feeling towards me so
I don't talk to anyone for that um and I
do think that my apology video maybe
came across slightly insincere because
when I was filming at the time my head
was a little bit all over the place and
then like what I was trying to say that
wasn't coming across how it was in my
head I am probably the worst person when
it comes to explaining things and like
was so I'm probably the worst person and
so the way I when I did that video just
kind of came across brilliant sincere
and I know that I want you to just own
up I just won't help so I put my hands
up and say that I was sorry about making
it all about me and like you know what I
was isn't that like there was no excuse
you know what I mean so I yeah the way I
wanted to do the video and the way it
came across was not good didn't come
across very well in my opinion anyway I
mean people say like oh she's not
changed or whatever like I do not blame
me for thinking that at all
I now he's proved to you more than ever
that I am NOT a fucking ignorant white
person that I was years ago um I'm very
educated on the situation and I'm very
educated on discrimination and all those
things I'm very educated on it now and
this whole situation has made me educate
myself even more I just hope that any of
my young audience I just hope that they
learn from my mistakes and that they
know like that's never okay
and I know that people are going to
doubt me now and people are going to be
like you know is she like that does she
describe
against other people does she think
she's better than anyone and it's easy
for me to sit here and say no I die but
it's easier just to say that it's easy
to say that you know I mean and as
somebody who is online and I hate to say
it influence I like I just hate that
word but I suppose to some extent we do
influence people's behavior I just hope
that people who learn from my mistakes
and know that this is not okay and
really do educate yourself and why prove
it
yeah I just hope that I can just show
you and continue should just be the
person I am today and hopefully you can
see that I'm not a dickhead ignorant
white person that write those things
there's an organisation a charity that I
would love to mention and it's called
get racism spread card and you can
donate money to that organization that
charity I'll link it below I think it's
amazing and what they do is they send
volunteers around schools to educate
young children and young people on the
importance of racism and how important
it is and I think that's amazing and if
you can donate anything please do it's
definitely an organization to try that I
want to get more involved with ya I
obviously just hope that in time you
guys will see that I'm not that person
and I would never ever ever think I'm
better than anyone let alone because of
my fucking skin colour like never ever
ever ever ever do I think of it than
anyone yeah I just really hope that any
of my audience and any of my uncle
audiences why please go and please go
and educate yourself and white privilege
please please please it's the only way
we're going to change this ignorant
mindset is if you go away and you really
educate yourself you've got to take the
time to educate yourself and if you are
somebody that knows somebody that is an
ignorant white person please try to
educate them as well as white people we
need to make a change like we need to
speak up because shits never gonna
change
if we don't speak up and I'm always
going to use my platform to speak up
whether it be foundations not being
inclusive brands like being inclusive
and does anything anything that I feel I
want to speak about or speak about and
yeah I just hope that I just hope on me
saying this that some of you do go when
we educate yourselves on white privilege
and stuff what do you love the most
about doing YouTube you're amazing at
what you do by the way love you think I
love the most about Junior
chip is being able to connect with so
many people online and to share like
something that I love with so many other
people that love the same thing I just
loved that like and we were just like
bounce off each other like you guys give
me suggestions I also you should try
this alright you should try this product
and I just love it it's like a big I
don't know it's like a community I'm you
love the same thing and I just I don't
know really excites me like I love it
when you guys are like try this product
it's so good and i try i'm like yes like
my subscribers everything like i just i
don't know i love like it's a connect
with so many people online and it's
definitely the best thing about doing
youtube 100% so the next question is
from Leon and he said how would you do
with negative influences and people
around you this is a hard one because I
feel like if you have negative family
members this is a hard thing because you
can't exactly just cut them off they're
your family you know what I mean and if
if it's neck if in regards to friend
don't be scared
so just not have anyone I I am not
scared of losing friends I don't care I
don't care if it was bullshit I come so
quick to cut people out it's a joke
anyone and everything I'm I'm not scared
to be on my own I'm not scared at all
so I don't part with bullshit
like I did in the past in past
friendship I'd let things slide let
things slide I just bite my tongue let
things slide and then it all built up
and I was just like no I want me do it
like why what is the point in this I
don't understand
negative people you've really really
really have to you are who you hang
around with and I'm so about that you
are here to hang around with if you're
hanging around with negative people that
are always putting that negative energy
you are going to be a negative person
you have to not be scared to be on your
own when I started YouTube I cut off I'd
say about six or seven friends I just
cut them off at that bow and see you
later
because for myself it was too negative
and but they were always so negative and
I just didn't want it around me like I
wanted to be successful on YouTube and I
want to do YouTube just being myself and
once I started to be a positive person
and positive thing starts happening to
me my you trying to start to grow and I
met hard like I had so many like things
happen to me as soon as I cut in
give shit off and unfortunately
sometimes you've got to be fucking
selfish like if someone's being negative
constantly constantly all the time and
it's affecting you you have to just cut
them off and it might be like a slow
thing like you don't mean notice it's
affecting you and then one day you'll be
like wow like I'm so nigga yeah here's
the thing I had a group chat once and I
used to be for Anika quite a big
friendship group and they would I was
always that person that was like muted
the group chats I'd be at work and still
wound up for it I mean it would always
be the same people slugging people off
psycho people off all the time and then
go to Instagram and comment in nice
things on the photos that is so fucking
weird to me that is so like I don't
understand that if you don't like
someone do you don't like someone but
why are you then going and common in
love hearts and I'm about to look
amazing on pictures that I find that
shit so annoying and so fake and I hate
that shit these people anyway these
these people were just like it was
constant it was constant negativity like
oh you know this and that and you know
this this like how do you explain just
like Nick pure negative shit all the
time and I just had to be like you know
what by like I'm not about this I don't
care for it I don't want to hear it like
you have to just anyone that's negative
you have to just cut them out you have
to in regards to family members mean
thing if you have to kind of block it
out and I mean I've had a family member
saying like no you can't do that like
over I like been negative about
something that I've been excited about
and then I've proven the wrong you've
just got and you've just got to block
people out and when it comes to friends
cut them out cut them out don't be
scared to be on your own I swear to God
I have like five friends and that's it I
don't need no one else I don't let
people in anymore I'm so over it
I'm so over it honestly at this point I
don't care for the fake shit I don't
care for the negative shit like I don't
care for it I'm so over it
someone's / best way to get rich like
I'm not rich by the way like I don't
understand that like rich in money rich
in happiness rich in what would you mean
I'm guessing you mean rich or money
money is not everything ok and when I
was younger I used to be like oh my god
like I want those money because I'm
gonna be happier and I'm gonna be like
it's gonna be amazing this stuff there
comes a point where you realize money
isn't isn't shit when you put your
health like you should be so grateful if
you're healthy like your health is
everything you know I mean there's
people that would trade everything to
have your health like health is the most
important thing in my opinion if I'm
healthy mentally physically I'm healthy
then I am I'm happy like I mind
represent happy I think obviously is
what a lot of people say it's like
people that have money like they just
say like oh you know money doesn't make
me happy and shit there is a certain
extent when money doesn't make you happy
because I have had people that I know
people that I love
struggle in debt in a real bad place
company bills just rule wrong bad
situations and I know how that can make
people depressed and that can make
people have anxiety that can make people
just feel so fed up and that can just
mentally do so much so much like having
no money it can fuck you mentally but
the same way having too much money it's
gonna fuck you mentally as well the only
way I feel that money makes you happy is
if you're somebody that's really
struggling and literally has nothing
then of course money is gonna make you
happier and I hate how people say you
know means me happy in that because
there's people that I've been able to
help out of certain situations that are
so much happier now because they're not
stuck in that dark place in that
situation where you know they couldn't
pay for anything and they had bills
coming out and they had people on their
case I mean people money and just so
much crazy shit like I helped them get
out of that and now it's like there's so
much happier so in that in that sense
money can make you happy but then I
think being rich is not something that
you need if you've got enough money to
pay your bills and have a little bit
spare each month then I promise you
that's all you need I don't know I'm
just saying if you've got your health
and your happiness your mental health
your physical health and
you're happy then you are so fucking
rich like you have no idea there's
people burning things every single day
health-wise there's people dying right
now like you have to really think is
money really everything no it's not like
I said it is it does it will make you
happy if you're if you're somebody
that's in that situation if you're
someone that's really really really
struggling of course having more money
it's gonna make you happy but I think
being rich is not as not needed I don't
think it's necessary okay the next
question if you could have dinner with
one famous person dead or alive who
would it be and why Pierce I love you
and your videos greens from Austria I
would have dinner with Michael Jackson
facts I'm a huge Michael Jackson fan
I fucking love Jackson five a lot of
Michael Jackson like I'm just I love it
so much um I love him so so much I just
find him so intriguing like just
everything about he dresses or I just I
just think he's such a gentle person
like I just don't care about what anyone
wants to say there's negative about
Michael Jackson I don't believe any of
that shit like I love him and that if
you that you know probably just found
him so sweet like when he had all those
terminally ill children come to his
house and you know he's fair ground and
stuff and he threw it like every week
and he'd have it with the kids over and
they'd have like special beds and
special things for children that could
come that are terminally ill and he said
do you things like that I just think I
just think he's such a gentle kind
person and I just love my good a person
and anyone was say anything I get
everybody I'm I'm not interested I love
him yes I love him so much
rest in peace Martha Jackson High Holy
you have actually inspired me so much
you have taught me to stay true to
myself and not care about anyone thinks
of you you have also made me realize my
true passion for makeup and beauty my
question is do you ever think you will
come to South Africa and your makeup
seminar and will you ever create your
own makeup brand lots of blood from your
biggest fan of touch-up PS can you in
time to please post more couple vlogs no
chance yes I would love one anything to
come South Africa and XEOMIN are like I
would love to go anywhere
in the world and dealers that would be
so amazing I would love that I would
literally love that and we ever create
your own makeup brand and yes I'm
extremely passionate about having my own
makeup brand because it's like a new
level of creativity
I mean creating makeup looks is
obviously something that I am so
passionate about and I love but then
creating your own makeup products is
like a whole nother level of creativity
so I have been working on something for
so long now which was supposed to the
last year end of last year and it got
moved back like a whole year because I
just it wasn't perfect and there were
certain things I want to change and so
that's something that's gonna definitely
be coming up and it's over me
everything's for me um I haven't had any
investors at any fact that it's just
spin me up to put my heart and soul into
there and I'll just kind of wait for you
guys to see it I can't wait I feel like
people are just like our beauty all the
influences come out of their own brand
and stuff and blah blah blah and it's
like so what like if we love makeup and
we're passionate about makeup why can't
we bring our own products it's like a
whole and it said a whole new level of
creativity it's like it's so amazing
when you see something in your head you
you screw it down and you see it come to
life and you're just like what the fuck
like it's so amazing so I definitely
afford anyone that wants to start their
own makeup around or anyone that won't
do anything like that I just think go
for it it's just amazing it's so much
fun it's so much fun so the next
question is what's on your bucket list
example skydiving swimming with sharks
etc I really want to conquer fears
before I die
now I know it sounds where I am so
extremely scared of heights I can't even
go up like a lie down like a little
stepladder like I'm just so scared of
heights is that something that I
definitely want to try and conquer like
my fear of that and I want to go
traveling at some point in my life I
once see so many places meet so many
people like I just that's something that
I would love to do as well definitely I
guess the next question and who is your

think it's just so fucking funny but
yeah enough hers up okay here are your
top three Instagram in spose do you know
what right I look at my Instagram and I
think oh wait it's gonna be so trashed
like my Instagram it's just a mess so I
just upload what I want 101 there's no
specific thing like it's just a mess top
three Instagram in space in regards to
theme wise and just being a fucking cool
Ian I'm really like she is a queen her
Instagram is next-level like if you go
for it it's like white thing pink thing
purple and she's just soaking up soaked
honest I lived for that like she's just
insane I'm Reesie um I love salary here
I think that's how you say a name like
she's a queen I love her almost there
something about hurts everything a lot
yeah that's the second person and the
third person Instagram pins but I always
say tummy hem bro in the fact that I
love what look at her Instagram her
Instagram is so nice to look at but like
inspiration wise like she makes me want
to fucking get and show you back and I
know I would never be like that like I
know I will never look like that but I
just she's a queen I live okay next
question any youtubers you have drama
with or have had drama with love your
videos by the way thank you I have never
had drama with no one I don't care for
it like I'm just in my own lane doing my
everything mind of my fucking god damn
business i I just don't care for it like
if someone wants to start beef with me
then I would just ignore you I would I
don't care for it I really don't care
for it okay someone but how do you go
about becoming a youtuber that's my
dream to be like you I love you girl
thank you so much and I think you have
to really think deep down do you really
want to be a youtuber or do you want to
do YouTube for the benefits because if
you wanted to you to for the benefits
don't do it I'm saying it now no matter
what you're doing like if you have to be
passionate about it and you have to
really want to do it and the reason why
I'm saying that is because just because
you wanted you to for all the benefits
yeah they're not going to want to film
video it's gonna get to a certain point
you're like I don't want to film videos
anymore and there's people that have
come and gone on YouTube and I think
they've started for the wrong reasons
realize that it's not all bright
sunshine and rainbows and so amazing
like there is shit that goes down and
there is stuff that you need to do and
it's not all glam and then they're like
oh shit I don't were youtuber anymore
but yeah I think you have to think if
you've deep down you really really
really want to be a youtuber for the
fact that you want to make content and
you're where inspire people and you want
to make content so you can connect to
people online I think that's perfect
that's the reason why you should start
don't start YouTube because you want PR
you want money you won and popularity I
suppose I hate that word
don't start a foot on the wrong reason
and started for the right reasons and if
you are gonna start for the right
reasons
I think it will happen for you I think
if you persistent you power cons good
content you really do it because you
want to connect with people who like you
spend the time connecting people
requires people do not resort they and I
think that's when your see growth in you
you'll do well
when you just people can see if you're
faking it like people watching videos
and they know you are like I don't
understand people that go online and put
on a fake persona it's so Bates I mean
I've got watching videos I know you're
not being genuine people like we have
human we're humans we have instincts we
know you know it means so I just think
do it for the right reasons
and I think you'll go far okay last
question because I feel like I'd let you
be family forever and advice for someone
going through a really hard time and a
breakup if you go through a really hard
time please surround yourself with
people that love you the family your
friends people that make you laugh I
just spend your time with people that
love and care about you because there's
nothing worse than locking yourself away
from everyone and just overthinking
everything in your head I am very bad
doing this I
I literally just as myself in people and
I've shot myself away by myself and I
overthink everything at the moment to
the point where it's not healthy it's
not okay so if you're going through a
situation where you feel like down and
you don't through stuff try and take
your mind off it so like go out of your
friends go to cinema or like got your
mom or your dad or you know just find
things to distract yourself I like now
going for walks and leave my friend in
the house go for walk and I find that
really helps to clear my mind
I really really highly recommend it I
didn't she just leave my phone in the
house and I was going for a walk for
like an hour and I just try not to think
about things and it just really helps
clear my mind but final works for you
but definitely thing just surround
yourself with people that love you and
remind yourself that it's this shit
situation now but it's not gonna be shit
forever okay so I just said last
question but this is gonna be the last
question because it was the last one
that I screenshot and so when are you
moving and how is the house process
going are you finding it stressful so
I'm getting the keys in over a week just
over a week now once we've got the keys
we're gonna rip the kitchen out and fit
a whole new kitchen we're gonna change
the floors we're gonna change quite a
lot about it so I probably won't be
moved in until August I think it's gonna
take a good month to kind of do it up
which I'm really excited about it's a
project it's going to excite it's gonna
be fun
and but yeah it's definitely stressful
and I think a lot of people think
because I'm a youtuber I'm gonna have
some big old fancy house like oh it's
just a normal house like I'm not it's
just no house I thought like people
think when you were you too but you're
gonna have like a big or fancy house but
that's not okay it's stressful in the
fact that I'm not good at interior
designer they think I think these things
in my head and then I don't want to put
them together the point I'm gonna go so
I'm very indecisive I can't decide on
things that I want but as long as things
are clean and things look tidy and
things work like I'm not overly bothered
if I'm being honest a home is a home and
I'm very grateful that I've been able to
afford home so that's just the main
thing really but I'm also the main thing
is I get to see Todd's every day which
