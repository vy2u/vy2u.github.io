youtube channel so today I am gonna be
filming a drugstore makeup look which is
this look right here which I am obsessed
with yes I need to get my nails in
because I know as much to look you know
I mean anyways so I know if you asked me
to try makeup revolution in a video so I
have combined some makeup revolution
some NYX I've got some L'Oreal puts
Maybelline and just a bit of everything
so yeah if you want to find out how I
did this makeup look then please keep
watch and also if you do enjoy the video
please make sure to give a thumbs up
because that really helps me let's just
get on with the video hey guys so the
only thing I didn't manage to get was an
eyebrow product I was gonna get the NYX
brow pomade or the brow bone so I like
both but they didn't have my color in
stock which is so annoying so I just
quickly do my brows of karma is the
iconic London cushion brow which I've
been using just Lowe's recently - some
of these products in this video I have
already used but I know there's new
people to my channel so you probably
won't know that I like this product so I
thought I would include them in here and
some products are new and I haven't
tried before so I'm really excited to
try them ok so they can see it I picked
up is the Maybelline the erase that eye
concealer in the shade nude I love this
concealer so much I've used it a lot on
my channel you guys will know that I
love this if you follow me for a while
it's definitely in my opinion the best
drugstore concealer out there it's a
very full coverage and it just applies
for you nice day and I just really like
it and the only problem with it is I
don't how many shades which is really
annoying I do normally take the sponge
off after a while because it just gets
messy and it just goes everywhere and it
just it's just annoying for me but um
it's fine at the moment so obviously
it's new so also I feel like you get
more coverage when you use the sponge on
the end I'm gonna use this I'm just
gonna apply some this to my lids just
kind of was like my eyeshadow base
anyway I'm just taking my Mac 105 brush
to cover up the brow and I find it hard
to find drugstore brushes does anybody
else feel like that I've got a couple
from NYX but I mean they don't do many a
drugstore do they like actual good
makeup brushes I
if I this concealer to the NARS radiant
creamy iron you just kept using mine
seenu's it up because I'd already bought
it
but this concealer is just everything I
love it so I did pick up these mini pro
color correct sponges from revolution so
you get you get a 5 in here and I've
just wet once obviously it's got a lot
bigger but it's really soft it feels
really good so excited I thought this
would be good for like the eye because I
always go over my can see it on my lid
and I just think this one's a lot better
it's not as big this is a good sponge I
don't see any difference between this
and a beauty blender is just a soft and
it works just as well so sometimes I
find with drugstore sponge is that they
tend to be in my opinion really stiff
and I just don't i stiff sponges but
this one's really soft so said I did get
a drugstore powder but this one is not
expensive asshole and get some beauty
BAE I think this is about eight and
don't quote me on that I'm not 100
percent but this is the RC my
translucent powder
if you're looking for a cheap option and
this one is bomb yeah I'm going to use
that little sponge to press this powder
on I definitely think this little sponge
is better for my eyelids I just got way
more control sometimes I feel like when
I use a big one I end up getting powder
in my eyebrows I make up to don't have
an idea I want to do like a white
eyeliner and then just put glitter all
over the top of it so it's like a Silver
Wing and then I want to smoke out the
bottom of like blues it's much more now
as you know so I picked up this NYX
white liquid liner I've had this before
but I can't find my don't know where it
went and and I had they do these in so
many colors I love that they have them
in like blue and purple and Brad so what
I'm going to do with this is I'm going
to wing my liner and then I picked up
this NYX glitter which is like a silver
but it's quite a little reflects of kind
of like blue and pepper and green and
other stuff in it and I'm going to stick
it with this Nick
literally so we're gonna see how that
works okay this line up the liner brush
is really really good it's very fine
which I like sometimes I throw it with
these sort of liners you get a thick
brush and just goes everywhere so I do
like that it's got a fine brush and it's
very like opaque like it's very white
it's not like clear already said
sometimes white lines and I've been
actually white Jamie I do want it to be
quite a thick line on you know whose
eyeliner I was initially living for
rails an X Factor she had to fill it out
she had everything and I was like oh my
god oh I want to find one of the looks
up have from X Factor and try and
recreate it okay I do find this product
is quite easy to control okay I do feel
like as it's dry and done its kind of
cracking a little bit but we're gonna
put glitter over this so I'm not too
worried hopefully that you won't see
that I'm gonna kind of see how the
glitter sticks on this side before I do
that side because I'm just too eager so
yeah I've got the NYX glitter it's
critically a primer so I'm hoping this
ab0 stick it says it's specifically
formulated skip glitter in place so this
is what the girl looks like it's just I
don't know if you can see the reflects
in it but you're just six so nice okay
so I'm gonna apply this get a primer I'm
just gonna put some in the back of my
hand
and I'm gonna apply it with my sowe've a
two to six brush I really hope this out
she sticks a girl and then I'm gonna use
the same brush to apply the glitter yes
so I can I'm good I'm so excited about
this okay after you really careful with
this part because you just want it to
stay exactly in that liner oh my god
this is sick do you get so scared about
using that glitter glue and stuff in
case they don't actually works I've had
some before I just didn't even stick and
then you just end up a good everyone
okay that's sick I'm looking for that
now what you say on the other side
which we like the only thing about this
line I would say if you're going to use
it on its own is it does seem to crack
which is weird with this one because
I've done this with the other one before
you seen that look did a yellow win I
know using this product and it didn't do
that so anyways white one does that word
mean you stop singing while I'm trying
to do my wing what do I owe this glitter
is number six by the way I just realized
it has a number on the bottom and then
when I did him that blue sparkly liner
about must be up to nearly two years ago
no must be maybe a year and a half ago
and that was like one of my favorite
looks I loved that so much and when I
applied some mascara to my last year's
I'm gonna use that
L'Oreal telescopic I used to use the
L'Oreal telescopic all the time it's one
of my favorite drugstore mascaras
especially for bottom lashes it really
separates your bottom lashes and makes
them look really long and then from
where eyelashes I didn't get any
drugstore lashes and but I do use these
ones and they Koko lashes and the style
are more and you can get them for 11:15
or false eyelashes top coat at you case
it's a UK website and I always get one
off there so yeah if you want to get
this all in the below but there are only
like a little puppet you which I don't
think is bad considering the quality of
these lashes and not me agree thin
they're complete synthetic and compared
to some people's prices in the market I
think these are really good so I'm not
in my last video I left my eyelash glue
my lashes so long and too dry and
everyone was like I'm gonna go don't
forget your eyelashes I do that all the
time I leave them to dry for a bit I
know completely forget about them which
I'm going to do now and I'm going to
make sure I don't forget so I'm just
gonna leave them there for a bit so we
can start on the face I didn't manage to
get a primer because they were all very
still acquiring me and I just
mmm I just know my drugstore isn't that
good around here so I'm just using my
fancy prefilled primer
if you know of any good drugstore
promise can you let me know because I'm
asked to order online because of course
oh my drugstore never really has
anything in there like they have the
smallish little stands okay foundation
I'm gonna be using the Maybelline fit me
matte poreless and the trade 220 and I'm
gonna mix it with my laurio total
infallible long wear foundation in the
shade amber so I've used both of these
foundations before and I've mixed them
with other foundations but I don't think
I've ever mix these two together because
even though this says it's matte and
poreless I don't find it matte in the
slightest and this one is a very full
coverage so it is adds the extra
coverage and then this one isn't too
much which is nice so with the shade
amber I'm gonna just dot some around my
face yeah and then the reason you fit me
matte poreless in the shade 220 so I'm
gonna put some of that on the back of my
hand I'm gonna apply this with a Beauty
Blender I want you to get a big version
of that phase makeup revolution sponges
but they didn't have any I need you
should retry the Real Techniques sponge
because everyone said I think I used it
I used it years ago and I never like
that because it was really stiffen it
was really hard but parentid every day
since then and it's not stiff or hard at
all so I definitely need to give that a
go again should I pick one up today this
isn't the best color match to be honest
so for my concealer I'm gonna use the
same concealer which is the eraser I
from Maybelline
I think what I've done is I've put too
much of that total cover on which I feel
like if you do if you do put too much of
that on it kinda starts a little bit
cakey so be careful with that first wipe
down a little bit too much of that one
on so I'm just gonna leave that
concealer alone for a little bit and I
want to try this this is the makeup
revolution London pro HD cream contour
it's in the shade light/medium so I do
think this looks quite good the colors
look quite good they're not too warm and
they're not too gray
so so far so good I just want to see
what the formulas like so I'm gonna take
my Mac 195 and I'm gonna use yeah I'm
gonna use this shade right here I fir
this looks a lot like the Anasazi
Beverly Hills cream console cat doesn't
like the pan stuff in the shades this
might a little bit gray but we'll see so
far it's very creamy to apply it's not
like stiff or anything then I did pick
up this brush from NYX which is the
offal brush with me it's a straight to
be a foundation brush just like a dent
stipple brush I'm gonna use this to
blend in the cream contour and see how
this works
mmm I do feel like this could this maybe
looks a bit gray I don't like this brush
he's kind of taken off my foundation as
I'm like blending it somewhat he's a
sponge and said I don't know how I feel
about that I don't know well it's like
on camera but in person it's not the
best this is why I don't really cream
contour that much because I find it so
hard to find a shade that isn't a muddy
or look too grained like looks I've got
dirt on my face do you know anything so
he would just kind of use like a cream
bronze are so sweet like a warm shade I
don't know I'm gonna put a bronze over
anyway but I don't think it's the worst
but anyway I'm gonna blend in the
concealer concealer looks good guys I'm
gonna stick my lashes I'm quickly before
they completely dry I like them pretty
much dry anyway not obviously dry but
like almost dry and then it's just so
much easier okay so I'm going to use my
I seem a translucent powder dark I said
this isn't classed as drugstore in the
UK or whatever but it's not expensive at
all so I'm going to set my under road
this
so I got this a brush from NYX which is
the oh three brush which is quite soft
and it feels nice also got this
revolution of bronzer which is called
bronzer kiss this might be too ready
might be too British but I'm gonna give
it a go anyway yeah let's just see how
this goes
it's a little bit too red I would say
it's not the worst I'm just gonna apply
tiny bit of this
oh so this brush is really nice very
soft and I miss applying the product
nicely which is good it's not going on
patchy or anything it's just the shade
of this I'm not overly obsessed with
okay so we're now gonna finish off my
under eye and I'm gonna be using this
NYX ultimate shadow palette and this is
the brights palette which has all these
shades in which I'm so excited I really
want to do a blue on the lower lash line
so I'm gonna take this NYX fluffy brush
which is the 32 brush and I'm gonna use
this shade first so this kind of like
teal blue here and I'm gonna apply this
shade first I definitely think it comes
out dark heart when you actually lay it
down on the eye I'm just gonna bathe
under here because I don't want to bring
this down too far about you use these
palettes before but not this actual one
and my had a look more like a burgundy
shades I'm sure and I used it before
it's really good I used it on the my
actual eyelid okay so next I'm gonna go
for this bright blue shade right here
and I'm applying this with my tutees
tips bunch of brush from zoeva
and applying this shade like closer to
the lash line and then I'm going back to
this NYX take two brush I'm going to
bend the two shades
okay so just dust it off that powder and
I picked up this blue it's actually got
a lip liner from NYX I'm in the shade
little denim dress but I'm gonna use
this as eyeliner I've put up with most
lip liners you can you can use them in
your iron it's fine
so I'm going to apply this in the lower
lash line
do you want a little bit of silver at
the bottom but I'm not going to use that
loose pigment that I've just because I
don't want to risk it and fall out on my
under I already have some and I don't
real anymore like it's literally like a
bunny there's so much glitter on my face
so anyway I'm going to use this dazzling
Jo liner from glam crystals and straight
shade silver which is from collection
and I'm just gonna apply a little bit in
the center of the eye kind of like an
upside down triangle and I'm gonna use
my L'Oreal telescopic too for my bottom
eyelashes when doing bottom eyelashes I
would do a little bit at a time because
you don't want to risk it in mascara
underneath there I always end up doing
it so now I just do like a tiny bit at a
time and then I wait for it to dry and
then apply another layer okay so from a
revolution makeup I picked up this
liquid highlight and I wish to see if
this is like the iconic London drops I
just wanted to see it so we're gonna
test it out this is the way I would
apply my iconic ones is I'd put a tiny
bit on the back of my hand it's got the
same sort of thing it's like that and
this is in the shade liquid champagne
see I'm just gonna drop some on the back
of my hand and then I'm gonna use this
sponge which doesn't have any powder on
it I've got this one as well as one's
got powder on it this one hasn't and I'm
gonna just apply a little bit to my
sponge and then applying it to the skin
okay it definitely looks jewy base
nowhere near as intense as the iconic
ones these are more kind of subtle so if
you did want a more of a subtle glow
than these ones are definitely perfect
for you as you can see there's still
glory that I've it's just not as intense
as iconic wonder ones I wish that we the
same it prize really nice they didn't be
a patch it looks nice it's just not as
intense so but like I said if you don't
want as as much of an intense highlight
then this one is good okay so I also
have this NYX born to go palette so I'm
going to this palette was actually said
to me I found it in my makeup box I was
like oh okay give that a go
I'm just gonna spray my brush with some
Winky X Mario Badescu spray so I don't
really know what shades are using this
palette that one looks a bit greeny grey
but then that went up to gold but I'm
please gonna do a little bit of both
please I'm gonna see how this goes and
it's a little bit yellowy because even
though this one here it's kind of like a
silver it's got reflects of kind of like
golden it makes it look a bit green okay
I think it looks the worst so I don't
picked up this revolution retro luxe
matte lip kit lip contour kit I'm
guessing this is kind of like a dupe for
the Kylie lip kit maybe I don't know but
this is in the shade no believe me I
don't think this is going to go with the
look actually okay I don't think that's
really gonna go with the look I did pick
up some Nick stuff which I've already
used before I'm going to try it on
anyway just to see how it feels on the
lips but I probably won't wear it with
this lip because it's maybe too dark but
I try it on my lips now and just tell
you what I think but it okay then I know
it's very creamy which is nice but it's
also a little bit difficult to use to
control cuz it's very creamy
it doesn't smell great either okay
that's a good lip liner it's like I said
it's very creamy and it's not very
difficult to use but at least not like
when we have to keep trying to put it on
so that's good and then this is the
liquid lipstick so a brushless a little
bit Bend I don't know what's going on
the smell of these is not good this
smells just not great that's something
you guys care about it doesn't smell
nice at all okay he's gone on quite nice
he's not dried down yet
but it definitely applies nice you need
a thin layer which is good
you'd have to keep applying it on top so
far I like it I just don't like the
smell smells just not great it smells
quite chemically good yeah I think it
looks good I'm gonna wear it a different
time not with this specific looks I
think it goes but I'm gonna wear it at
some point and I like it guys know how
it is for out the day like what I've
been eating and drinking and stuff see
how it lasts but it was good
it's I picked up some of the NYX
lingerie liquid lipsticks I love these
so much I love NYX lip products they're
literally one of my favorites I love the
lip liners
I love the liquid lipsticks I love the
butter gloss I love the lip matte lip
creams I just love everything lip from
NYX if you use matte lip liners you're
playing yourself you're playing yourself
because NYX have just as good lip liners
for way less money so you ready to check
them out this shades very peachy which
is nice
it's called dusk to dawn I don't think
that's right okay so this is the NYX
lingerie liquid lipstick in the shade
satin ribbon I'm just going to see what
just colors like okay I think this color
will do and then I'll put a gloss on top
so I do see first of all on my lip so
this is this way lip liner from NYX in
the shade stock colum
there's no likely nine
yeah and then this liquid lipstick is in
the show satin ribbon her necks I think
I'm gonna leave it Matt I think I want
to just have a matte lip with this looks
but I'm actually really shocked because
I know honey really like these lingerie
matte liquid lipsticks with these
honkers already dry I don't know what's
going on
anyway I'm gonna spray my face with some
of the Mario Badescu facial and aloe
facial spoke out of cucumber green tea I
don't to surpass this drugstore but it's
again it's not very expensive because
it's eight pounds just knit one and get
a big one for 12 pounds I will link it
below some glue spray this this isn't a
setting spray by the way guys this is a
more just to kind of bring your skin
back to life after you've applied
shit-ton of Howard off so for some
reason I forgot to end the video I don't
know why but hope you guys enjoyed this
