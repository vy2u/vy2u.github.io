I'm using the anastasia beverly hills
dipbrow pomade this is in ash brown I'm
just using this to enhance my eyebrows I
like them to look darker as I've got
black hair and I just like them to look
more enhanced so yeah also I'm using
this brush an angled brush that I got
from Superdrug which is Revlon and it
was about four pounds
so next I'm using the Revlon perfecting
primer this is my favorite drugstore
primer it's really inexpensive and it
does keep my makeup on all day so for
foundation I'm using the NARS sheer glow
mixed with my Mac Studio Fix fluid I
really like this combination of product
it looks really good on my skin so yeah
and I'm just applying this with my
Beauty Blender also I am all about that
ponytail life at the moment so I'm like
ponytail all day every day and I do not
really moody in this video but I can
promise you I am happy and bit yeah
I have a smiled once resting bitchface
so next to highlight I'm using the
Maybelline perfect and cover concealer
in light this is my favorite drugstore
concealer the consistency is really
really nice and the coverage is good and
also it's really really good to bend as
well
you
so I'm just highlighting my brow by now
using the Anastasia Beverly Hills cream
contour kit this is shade banana I'm
just blending that in with my finger
so now just a contour I'm using shade
cinnamon from the Anastasia Beverly
Hills cream contour kit if you guys
watch my videos you'll know that this is
all I ever used to contour with just
because it is so easy to blend
also if you're wondering why my voice
sounds really different and I have
actually just got cold say yeah
so I'm just going over my face using the
zoeva buffer brush so now just to set my
concealer I'm using shade banana again
but from the powder contour kit
yes this is my favorite part of the
whole makeup look and this is the mary
lou manizer highlighter by the balm
absolutely obsessed with this product as
you can see is so pigmented and it's
just amazing now I'm just priming my eye
using the Mac Paint Pot in painterly
so now using the sleek ultra matte
eyeshadow palette I'm just taking the
brown shade and I'm just working this
into my crease and slightly up towards
my eyebrow just to open up my eye more
now I'm just blending this all in with
my fluffy brush this is just a random
fluffy brush that I've had for ages it's
not a certain egg tool
I think it's off eBay or something but
yeah next using is the weaver smoky
palette I'm just taking the dark brown
shade called ashes awake I'm just
working this into the outer corner of my
eye and my outer crease and again I'm
just blending this all in now with my
fluffy brush now just taking the white
from the sleek eyeshadow palette I'm
just applying this all over my eyelid
now I'm just using the brown color from
the sleek eyeshadow palette and I'm just
using this underneath my eye now using
the mary lou manizer I'm just
highlighting the inner corner of my eye
and my brow bone now for my eyeliner I'm
using the Maybelline gel eyeliner and
the same brush from superdrug not the
exact same brush but the same brush if
that makes sense and I'm just making a
line from the as one of my eye up
towards the end of my eyebrow and then
I'm just working the product back
towards my eye and it just makes the
line a lot neater and I just find it a
lot easier to do it this way
now for mascara I'm using the Max Factor
masterpiece mascara I'm just applying
some to my eyelashes before I apply my
fake eyelashes so again using my
favorite eyelashes that you use in every
single video because I'm literally
obsessed and I did think they were
called the long lash but they're
actually are called the 747 eyelashes MZ
yeah I really really love these and
they're super super long
so now for my lips I'm using my favorite
lip liner which is the max price lip
liner and I'm just outlining my lips and
then I'm going to fill them in with a
lipstick from Elizabeth Arden which is
the nude matte shade and it's number 43
I really love this lipstick and I've
never really used a lipsticks before
until now so and they are really really
nice and they don't dry your lips out so
now my eyelashes are dry I'm just going
to apply some of my mu a black eyeliner
to my waterline ready taking this
halfway across and because I don't want
to make my eye look small and lastly to
set my face I'm using the mac fix+ I
hope you guys enjoyed this video if you
