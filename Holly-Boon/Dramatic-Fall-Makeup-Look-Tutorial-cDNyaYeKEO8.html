shade peanut butter and I'm just using
my fluffy brush and working this into
the crease now I'm just using a piece of
cardboard to make sure that it's nice
and neat and to prevent any fallout next
using the same brush I'm taking shade
truffled which is a darker Brown and I'm
just working this into the outer corner
of my eye and into my crease next with a
flat brush I'm taking shade licorice
which is black and I'm just working this
into the outer corner of my eye and then
I'm just using my bending brush to blend
this all together
now I'm using my all-over shader brush
and shade mousse and I'm just working
this into the inner corner of my eye and
now I'm just blending that all together
just to make sure there's no harsh lines
see ya
now for the underneath of my eye I'm
just using shade truffled
now for my winged eyeliner I'm just
using an angled brush from Revlon and
the Maybelline gel eyeliner I always put
really funny faces when I do my makeup
so yeah I do apologize to that and I do
it was it really moody but I'm really
not I promise
so now just applying some Max Factor
masterpiece mascara before I apply my
false lashes I am using the Sorella is
like I use in every single video and
every single day of my life I think the
number 43 but I'm not sure and they work
with the long lash but I do know that
she's changed them to numbers now but I
will find that for you and we'll tag
that below
so now I'm just using my Elizabeth Arden
smokey eye pencil I'm just putting some
of this into my waterline and just
underneath my eyelashes and just to give
more of a smoky look
so finally I'm using the map a lip liner
this is portside and which is a really
really nice burgundy color for winter
and autumn obviously but yeah I hope you
guys enjoyed this video and I will see
you again next time thank you for your
lovely comments and messages it really
means a lot and I'm so glad that you
enjoy my videos
