hi everyone welcome back to my youtube

thank you before I get cited for 300,000

thought I would ever have as many people
subscribe to my youtube channel I'm just
so glad that you guys enjoy my videos
because all I do is touch it but make
one so I'm glad that you actually like
what I do but yeah I just want to say a
quick thank you
also this choker is from revile --nt and
all of the products and everything that
I've use will be linked in the
description box below if you do recreate
some promptly Fifi tag me in your
pictures when I love seeing them to
peace I agree on Twitter Instagram and
if the relax everyone is here and but
yeah I'm going to shut the up and
get on with this link up Shira so if you
want to see how I did this makeup look
then because I'll have to stand this I
become relic I always do just because I
was experimenting education awards film
so basically did this I look to go of my
choker that's how we do that I use the
Maybelline age rewind concealer for base
and it's going to crack on so I am going
to take my star - Vegas new palette and
I have a dislike for so long and it's
just as it came out which was over here
at idea blue I'm just going to use these
two top shades these shades aren't
impossible to find so you don't need to
have this part to get those shades so
I'm going to use a minimal first of all
on my signal i tapered blending brush
just going to go in the crease and just
above the crease really lightly anyway I
wanted to create something that was
going to be easy enough for like you to
do it yourself I'm gonna make wires to
do your makeup a prom then this look is
it she's so easy I literally just use
three eyeshadows so yeah I just thought
I'd create something it's like glam but
easy to recreate so you guys can do it
at home so you can look snatch for prom
I hate you one like sometimes your eye
makeup goes really well and then you go
to do a winged liner and it just messes
the whole thing out and you're like oh
my god
there's so I thought why not create
something about a wing it's nice and
glam to big lashes you know how I do
so I'm then going to go over this shade
girls night mine's a bit as a I
used it wet
using the rush wet and it's up
anyway so I'm going with shade girls
night on my max 2 to 4 and I'm going to
close in the crease for some reason my
background looks very greeny it's
actually twisted round I'm just going to
go back in with my tapered blending
brush with that shade mineral LOL over
nothing
so we're going to go back in with girls
knife back in the crew okay so once I've
done that I was so excited when these
came through the post morphe centrosome
ones they're spoiled
are these do the pressed pigment that
full shadows I am just obsessed I can't
even go with this look at this color
it's just like they're so pigmented as
well it literally one swatch on my hand
look look at this I died
and they came in the place I've got so
many cars I was like arms when you use
these constantly so I'm going to take my
map tube or two and I'm going to spray
some like big splash on my brush and
then I'm going to apply this all over my
lid this color
it's called Rodeo Drive the shade
you might want to make sure you do eye
makeup for your face because this these
are beautiful these jellies but they
have a lot of Fallout so you want to
make sure you do eyes that see don't
ruin your makeup
your face makeup gorgeous things are
really beautiful on any eye patterns
well you can't go wrong really if you
don't know its new of your eye makeup
over Bowl come warm tones you can't
really go wrong I guarantee you it will
it nice okay so I'm just going to align
my lash line before I apply lashes so
I'm going to take my Sigma gel liner and
my eo6 winged liner brush and yeah I'm
just going to run this along the lash
line
since going a bit of mascara using the
l'oreal miss coffee the lashes are using
are the newly lashes in Miami these ones
aren't so big I love them put these
dashes are like expands there but it's
prom so you treat yourself I'm going to
start on my face now I'm just going to
put your headband on just potential hair
from the face I put these the other day
because whenever I do my makeup I end up
getting my house it's its own wind so
then still hair bun and it cute like a
five year old great so I'm going to use
two different primers the first one of
many years is the MTA where you have
makeup prep I love this so much it's so
hard again it feels I hope you explain
how it feels like in it she feels like
water on your skin it just feels so
around just who's so hydrated if you're
early and you really want a hydrating
coronal and really Russell in the Sun
then I'm going to use the professional
 benefit see what large pores this
stuff it's just so good so for my
foundation and back to using lao-tzu
favorite which is the total cover
Valerio and too much mix together
I can't fold this foundation combination
it's just a dream in the True Match I
use shade golden amber and then in the
total value shade
number which is static number 32 so I'm
going to apply some of the total cover
first of all I always think first of all
but I think first of all kinds
the same so I'm just going to dot this
around 3d rendered by Sigma I'm going to
take my too much and then when I start
blending this all in this foundation as
I always say it is a very full coverage
with satin finish which is the type of
foundation I go for just seems in a
mixer but I was really far away okay so
for concealer I'm going to take my
Maybelline age rewind and Sheen the
shade light I don't like to try to have
to get a sponge on it so I know you can
respond officer I've done in the past
and graduations kind of puts them on the
back of my hand and then I'll just take
my Sigma concealer brush which is the
s75 and I'll just apply using this and
says I do love this age rewind concealer
I just wish they did it in washes they
only have to shade nude and light I have
had that they are bringing you some more
shades out which is really good tonight
because I realized concealer but I just
can't use it when I'm working more times
because it's way too light and the new
one for me is a little bit too pinky
okay so again I'm going to take my 3d
blender from Sigma ok after that I'm
going to take my Laura Mercier
translucent powder and it's going to set
under my eyes and then I'm just going to
sit here because I get any one get some
smile lines throughout the day just go
ahead and apply some powder I'm just
going to process in my tea though
because I get very live there so I'm
going to warm up my warm up my face I'm
gonna take some of the iconic London
pigment stick in four point one and I'm
going to place the out for a more of my
face and then the brush I like to use is
this one from like light under this
round one
then I'm going to take my mac mineralize
skinfinish and dark deep and visit this
big brush from morphe which is the our
bow brush i really why i get my nails on
white because i never stay white they're
literally covered in makeup now right
anyways the red text is makeup geek
infatuation blush it's a very nice
peachy shade I'm going to use my Too
Faced mr.right brush so I'm going to do
um whilst the finish of my eye makeup so
I'm going to go into that shade minimal
from the palette on my morphe 504 brush
and I'm going to really something for my
life I'm then going to take that shade
girls night and I'm going to run this
along the lower lash I'm gonna try and
keep this as close to the lash line as
possible then taking that foiled shadow
this plum which is in shade Rodeo Drive
on my Mac 242 I'm going to apply this
underneath my eye as well so I'm not
going to bring it all the way out I'm
just going to bring it halfway and then
just going to take my L'Oreal telescopic
and apply as - to move on Russia's
so I'm going to take my iconic Angelou
Mehta drops is in the shade original you
can use kind holy b10 and you get money
off yes to that and then I'm going to
take these drops on my Sigma 3d blender
then after that I'm going to take my oil
Cosmo eggs and nikkietutorials collabs
this is a highlight I'm obsessed with it
is so bright on a funnyman of them I'm
going to take my morphe r-36 brush I'm
going to spray some fixed glass on this
brush so for my lip color I'm going to
take the boat frog because my ex I think
this is from the nikkietutorials collab
as well this is a nude potion it's a
very nice pinky nude I'm then going to
take my peaches and cream lip gloss in
shade honey and I'm going to apply this
on top

corner of my eye what kind of presence
online so I'm going to take that light
shade from nikkietutorials
