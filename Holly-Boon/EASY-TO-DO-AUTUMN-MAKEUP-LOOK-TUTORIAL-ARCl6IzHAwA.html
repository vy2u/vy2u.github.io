channel if you are new here then my name
is Holly Boone please subscribe join my
little community here on YouTube and so
today I thought I would film a look
using the morphe 35o 2 palette I did
want to switch your artwork contacts
because I haven't switched my look up in
so long and I used to wear contacts all
the time so I did get these contact
lenses from Vizio I'll link them below
and also this top is from misguided it's
just off the shoulder to the long sleeve
it's cropped it's really cute I do be
just can't go misguided which is Holly
mg 30 you get 30% off the whole of the
website weltover only I just thought I'd
let you guys know in case you want to
get anything from misguided it's
literally only for October so make sure
you make good use of that and off is a
lot so I will put that in the
description box as well yeah if you want
to see how I did this makeup lip but
then peace ok so I'm gonna start with my
brows I'm gonna use the benefit
precisely my brow pencil I have put a
little bit of brow gel in my brows
already I use the Anasazi Beverly Hills
brow gel so I just kind of want to use
this brand so I kind of just start from
the start of my brown and I just kind of
like carve it out really lightly what I
have started doing with the start of my
brow is I used to kind of try and make
it quite straight here because my brows
actually good like that but I would try
and make them more like that but now I'm
just gonna follow my natural shape and
walks I just prefer it so close
underlying like that and then brush the
excess products upwards
it makes me crazy and then I just kind
of like follow the natural shape
like that and then just lightly apply
product and then let's start with route
I just kind of brush upwards so it
creates little hair strokes
I'm gonna take my NARS radiant creamy
concealer in the shade custard and I'm
gonna carve out my eyebrow and use this
from my eyeshadow base so to cover up my
browser when use my Mac of one-nine-five
right it's really frustrating and I'm
trying to grow my eyebrows so I'm trying
to like leave them because I just
wouldn't I love it more fall and then
the struggle is real cuz when you put a
concealer you can see all the little
hairs I'm pretty is going to give in and
end up liking them anyway but I'm trying
to wear them just this little bit under
hair it went a little bit more but uh I
do get really like I do go over 82
tweeter sometimes like over flack them
and I'm like everyone always asked me
like where to get your eyebrows done and
I finished over us I plucked them myself
when I flopped on myself since I was
like 14 and I just trimmed their
scissors and stuff I just I don't want
to get them Fred and I just don't trust
people with my eyebrows honestly I was
gonna get my eyebrows Michael Brenda but
I just don't trust people near my
eyebrows I'm just so like I don't know
okay so I'm just using my visa Brenda to
get rid of any excess product like that
and then I'm gonna apply some powder to
my I live three different sponge this is
the oxy my translucent powder
I love playing around like I cut it like
I love switched on my eye color haven't
done it in ages
I think is good as well if you guys have
lighter eyes or what's maestro's it's
good for me to switch my eye color up
you know it means you can see where it's
like if you had like realize we're gonna
be using the morphe 35o 2 palette I
literally happened even swatch any of
these I wish you just look there I was
waiting to this video I'm obsessed I'm
obsessed with this bright red okay so I
did want to use that red but I feel like
I read on a red look on my channel
I did like a fiery red look so I don't
ever want to do red I can only do
something a bit soft I feel like I'm
gonna go for this shade first of all I'm
using this brush from the anastasia
beverly hills i shadow palette is too
fluffy end i really like this brush so
I'm just gonna first of all apply this
shade just above my crease that's nice
makes really nice I feel like I'm gonna
do something it's like super matte on
the eyes and like soft okay that make
sense
it's a nice color as well he sure knows
I saw amazing for the price I can't you
mean your eyebrow like they're just so
pigmented and just so such such such
good shadows I felt if you love warm
shades and this palette is literally
perfect for you
I'll definitely prefer the shades in
this one to the original 85 oh they've
really stepped it up I Rea like this so
next I'm going to dip into this shade
here and I'm using my Sigma e30 a brush
just cover here in the third row you do
have named that SHINee okay so actually
gonna tell you the names of these so the
first color used in the crease was the
Shaytan and now I'm gonna use this shade
spice in the crease I really should have
not run over see and I'm gonna with the
shade spice and I'm gonna apply this in
the crease
try to lift the lid yeah yeah okay so
that should spice I've just applied all
over the lid really like that and then
I'm just gonna use this fluffy brush
again the edges okay so that is this you
what I'm going to do for my list because
I just love that I think that looks so
nice and warm II and by I'm gonna swatch
some of these shimmers for you in here
because I wanted to show you what it it
like so when I watch the shakes sauce
which is okay shimmery orange wow that's
so bright yes I love that so that one is
the shape olive it's in the shape here
that one is initially I made then I love
that I continued home with my makeup so
the only battery in this palette called
ways I'm gonna take this shade on my Mac
266 brush and I'm gonna just press this
on the national and then we just have a
liquid or a gel but sometimes it can
look too harsh so I prefer doing this
way I shall definitely think my
eyelashes have grown I'm using vitamin E
oil guys follow me on snapchat
when using vitamin E oil and where that
is I definitely love growing so I have
these lashes I think these are the
ICONic light ones once I you use lushes
once I don't put them back in the thing
I just have a box of eyelashes I have a
completely random ones in there so I
think these are iconic lights from house
of Russia's I'm pretty sure okay so
whilst I wait for my lash glue to dry a
little bit I'm going to start on my face
so I'm gonna use the pixie
Rose oil blend I use this all the time I
love it so much so I've just zoomed out
a bit so you guys can see my full face I
just love it I am oily my keys I bow
just I can't explain just it's so
hydrating it just feels so good I love
it okay and then I'm gonna use my fenty
and beauty primer on top listen actually
makes my skin feel so soft
I always want to put the pixie or we
always put the pixie oil on first and
then apply this on top and I just love
what makes my skin feel mmm-hmm
I'm just gonna do a bit of lip prep I'm
gonna apply some of the car mix lip balm
I used to use one from Pangos urban
decay I used to love it and I can't put
no Mac lip conditioner I used to use a
Mac lip conditioner I don't know where
mine went so I picked this up over day
but definitely to get a lip conditioner
again I still love that though for my
foundation I'm gonna use the Mac Studio
Fix fluid NC 42 and I'm gonna mix it
with the Maybelline fit me matte
poreless in the shade 220 and I did by
the max unifix food inside NZ 35 which
is like my correct shade see I do prefer
these to mix together because it just
gives me a more of like a not so matte
finish even though that one says it's
matte and poreless and I just don't
think you're something that it kind of
just gives me more of a luminous finish
if I mix it in with the Mac okay what I
think I actually prefer the finish of
this foundation when I use a brush so
I'm gonna stop that I'm gonna use a
brush so I'm gonna use this like kabuki
brush from iconic London
I'm gonna use a brush first of all and
then I'm gonna go over it with a sponge
but I do like the way the brush applies
I really don't know why I picked up a
bright luminous yellow maybe sponge
because honestly it looks so messy like
I try and wash it and it just does not
go back to normal so it just looks so
die I've got a thing about that like I
hate when we sponges look dirty I call
with my foundation so much when I find
it like I just been so long but in
my skin because I hate it when that
foundation sits on top of your skin and
then it can look a bit cakey so I do i
suspend quite a while just pushing it in
my arm literally eggs trying to get
little breakouts like here she was like
Tommy mom John I mean I always get
breakouts they're so inane I actually
hate meeting out sometimes boys have
it's so easy don't they what isn't it
you have it so easy and I have to give
birth they don't sub periods we have to
take contraceptives and makes us go
crazy we're gonna have to take concepts
and weeks go crazy but sometimes we do
if you have crazy crazy periods and you
do don't you know okay so you can see
like I'm used in is the NARS radiant
creamy and the shade ginger just apply
this under my eyes a little bit on my
forehead edge hit so I'm just gonna
stick my lashes on last this concealer
tries a little bit because I'm just
gonna those luxuries dry and weather on
my irons for a minute and then I'm gonna
apply some black and white top water and
I'm just to make sure that you can you
can't see like where the eyelashes start
that's the night that I first of all I'm
just gonna drive or a sec while I
bending the concealer
I really want another holiday I can I've
been on so many holidays this year but I
just really wanna go somewhere war I
hate cold weather if I got to talk about
the weather in every video is
there ever video I don't know about that
but I really want to go to Santorini
I've seen so many people go there I'm
the canal so nice what Mykonos and in
Santorini I really want to go there just
it's so unreal I think Greece is
something I'm definitely gonna go to
expert Santorini is mad expensive I was
thinking you want to come to America
like I've been to New York but I really
want to come tonight
na I want to come I just want to see
everything I want to go to Vegas
move it to Miami just just like travel
America at some point you need money
that kind of you know cuz I'm not
so person I can't do traveling out of a
rock sack like I'm too light
I just con I need to make sure that I've
got bad as well I can't sleep in a tent
or I'm just not about that life
I need a shower while I need you not I
mean okay so I'm gonna take my iconic
London pigment stick in the shade
Hawkwind one first for this I did use my
NYX one which I do prefer the color of
what I can't find it used to like this
one but it's a lot more warm and he's my
iconic London like kabuki type brush and
benders name
friends in so quick look at that oh I
really like to use creams as bronzers
and stuff because I feel like sometimes
when you try and bronzer powder it just
kind of I don't know it just doesn't
bronze you off as much so I do like to
use a cream underneath I just think it
looks nicer as well
oh so do you like my contour shade to be
a little bit warm I just prefer it
because if I use something that's quite
cool just I don't know I just like the
way it looks with me look a bit muddy
couldn't like I've got dirt on my face
this coffee's really driving me man I
like a constant Kaufmann we're gonna
edit out I literally can't stop coughing
it's so frustrating but you mean try and
sleep so wasn't a night when you're
trying to sleep but it's just like
bitchy weight sleep in okay so then we
use my Studio Fix power and shade NC 43
and I have quite a few of these prices
now but NC through it with 43 I've got
NC 30-something I bought a couple of
shades for when I'm like sometimes on
more tan than other days sometimes I
fake times I'm not I don't but this is
for when I'm tired I says he fought you
through which is still actually lights
had done the foundation if you were to
get the foundation in c43 yeah I'm just
taking this big fluffy brush from it
