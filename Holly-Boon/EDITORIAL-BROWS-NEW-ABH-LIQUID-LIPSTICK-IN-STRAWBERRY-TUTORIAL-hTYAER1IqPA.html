this video because I'm going to do more
of an editorial eyebrow those of you but
those of you asked me how I managed to
get that look so I'm going to show you
what I did it's kind of annoying because
my eyebrow hairs were longer when I did
it so I don't know if is going to have
the same effect but we're going to try
anyway so no needs of people like the
slope brow has been very viral and you
can use so if you want if you don't know
well that is desi Perkins did a video on
the site brow but I am actually going to
use brow gel instead so first of all
before done anything to my eyebrows I'm
just going to comb them upwards with the
brow gel once you've applied the brow
Jose will let you up I brush twice for a
second
so now I'm just going to take my brow
Wiz by Anastasia Beverly Hills is in
shade dark brown I'm just going to let
you fill in where I feel like home when
it's look a bit more fill up
you read it or don't apply too much
pressure because you don't want it to be
at them or redefined eyebrow so that is
how you get like a messy editorial
eyebrow obviously the bushy are and
thick your eyebrows aren't very is going
to look um saw me isn't exactly how I
want it but it still gives the same
effect so yeah so I'm just gonna move on
to I should have assumed in from the
start I just realized that would have
really been helpful but oops anyway so I
was going to start on my eyes so for
this look I'm going to go for just kind
of looks really really soft not even
anything on my eyes really just a winged
liner and a bold lip that's what we're
going for
so first of all I'm gonna just carve
that out I'm gonna take the back of
ultimate coverage concealer what
surprised I'm obsessing this if you guys
don't already know thing is with me is I
find products like absolutely love and
then I just don't ever want to try
anything else like that is they see what
I'm like so it pretty gets a bit boring
for you guys sometime
okay so I'm just going to take my Laura
Mercier translucent powder and my Sigma
p89 brush this is the bait precision
brush i'm just brush I'm just going to
apply some of this to my wife avorite
looks at his fear life I love the
colors and start I've ordered the kylie
jenner liquid lipstick and pumpkin I'm
moon I'm so excited him to come I'm
obsessed with this that those shades so
they're like so me Oh shades saw them I
was like okay I need to get them so I
haven't really been a be fussed by her
liquid lipsticks like I do I do love
them but because it takes so long to
calm and then you have to pay him
protecting the stuff I kind of after
buying like Dolce K and candy care
wasn't really too fast about ordering
any more but when it's all those colors
I was like okay okay so actually don't
you want to put a thin on my eyes I just
want to wing one iron that's basically
it I want to keep it really plain so I'm
just going to take the beaches and cream
by makeup geek and let you just apply
some of this in the crease I'm just I
look at a teeny tiny bit of color
so when I start doing like more
challenge videos I tried to challenge my
brush trying to I had to do makeup with
your hands because I watched um pieces
of nikkietutorials and she made it so
easy I was like okay like I'm gonna get
this guy and uh it was an absolute fail
and I'm sorry because we want to avoid
it cuz it was really funny but ladies if
it was out of focus so I'm gonna just
even like do that again I will do like
and I'm a challenge video because I do
you think they're quite funny okay so
for my wing I'm going to take the
waterproof cream color this is the gel
liner by Anastasia Beverly Hills as you
notice I'm eating a lot of their
products because I've got a PR package
from them they sent me everything I'm
just obsessed with them you guys like
every single product at them use from
that brand I'm obsessive I've never had
anything bad to say about any of their
products so I am obsessed see I'm going
to use this to wing my line up I'm gonna
take my zoeva through 17 winged liner
brush I don't really like using this
brush winged eyeliner anymore like I did
like my Sigma II oh six brush but
instead I'm gonna have to reorder that
that was like my fame
okay so I'm just going to do my other
one off camera just to say from home
because it always takes the ages to do a
second one yeah
okay so then I'm just gonna quickly curl
my lashes for my fake ones
I'm just going to apply a little bit of
mascara first of all this is the L'Oreal
telescope it and then just before I pull
my lashes I'm going to take some of that
gel liner and I'm just going to run get
on my top waterline so the book it makes
my lashes blend a lot better take the
house of Russia micronics these are my
favorite lashes and this eyelash glue is
by junior lashes it's so good it's
tissue my favorite the key to eyelashes
is you want to apply the glue and just
let it dry for a little bit before you
slip them on so we try to stick them on
straight away wet with wet glue we will
get a bit impatient sometimes and I'm
like I have to stick them on but it
makes so much difference if you just
wait a little while I'll let you just
wait for them to dry a little bit fast
I'm going to take these tweezers to
apply them so just find it so much
easier I just tend to kind of like stick
the middle first of all and then you're
just the edges as to where I want them
okay so I will stare dry in I'm going to
start on my fingers so first of all I'm
going to apply some of the Becca
backlight priming filter I'm going to
apply some of this first of all I have
actually running out of this which is
really annoying
I'm just gonna spray my face with some
fix+
then for foundation you guys are not
ready for this
this foundation if you want ultimate
full coverage but doesn't feel cakey
this is just amazing like I never ever
ever ever have found a foundation on
this fear because I'm either like the
fingers of me I'm even like full
coverage or obviously like a bit
concealer bronzer I never really go for
light coverage because like published to
me it's just a bit concealer and bronze
on it for the knees so when I go like
full coverage I need full coverage you
know I'm saying and so this foundation
is bomb like you only need the tiniest
bit it covers everything it's so good I
can't even explain I know I have not
been sent there or anything like that
these itches like oh so good you're just
about to see anyway so I'm just going to
apply it with a kabuki brush like it
applies the best
well the only thing is that you need to
be really hydrating on your pilot if not
I feel like it will cling to dry patches
and stuff so you need to make sure that
your skin's nice and moisturized and
hydrated and I find it only other thing
that I don't like white is I don't like
the smell
Hogan smells like pencil sharpening
that's so random but I want to see that
after it smells like
the shade I'm using by the way is bamboo
it is a little bit too dark for me
because I brought this when I was really
tanned I quite literally just on my fate
town and then I brought this so here's a
little bit too dark but I feel I want a
bit concealer and stuff on it lightens
it up a bit anyway so it's okay it evens
it out so then for concealer I'm going
to take the Naked skin concealer this is
shade light more
so I've then just going to bend that and
use my Sigmar concealer in kabuki brush
this is the F 79 brush you can use crow
Holly for money off at Sigma
so I just zoomed in a little bit crazy
just so you can see this foundation it's
iike she dull skin in my opinion like
it's the best full coverage ever are so
obsessed now ok so then it's going to
bake my other iron guys hit the laura
mercier translucent powder as always and
this is actually the Sigma tapered
highlight brush but just going to use it
to bake my own Drive
hi there just to bake my nose every I'm
gonna take my Sigma bake precision
precision brush really cancel sorry
about the lighting it keeps changing
so whilst that's bacon I'm going to take
my this is the mac medium class Studio
Fix perfecting powder I'm just going to
use this and apply this to the rest of
my face where I have applied this powder
I think this is quite newest product I'm
not sure but I've never heard of it
before until like always going on like I
need up
that I was going to take my tapered
highlight brush and just brush off this
excess powder
um so next I'm just going to contour I'm
going to be taking the necessity for
videos contour kit this is it this is
the light medium and I'm going to take
the darker shade here on my stick art
duo fiber brush
I'm always looking in the side bit sorry
if it's annoying I just like to check
that I'm in focus all the time because
there's been so many times but I'm like
filming and then I'm like completely out
of focus sorry I'm just going to finish
off my eyes so I'm just going to quickly
just apply a little bit of mascara to my
top lashes to make sure they've been
nicely so again I'm going to take some
of the shade beaches and cream and just
run some of this under my eyes like it's
changing because the Sun keeps going in
and out it's video
so I'm going to spray my face with some
mac fix+ real quick
and then I'm going to apply some with
some to my eye besides DW here with a
2/3 brush look how much I've use this
kit already I am obsessed I haven't even
had this this long I've had this like 2
weeks and I've just I've just been
obsessed I've been using it constantly
like everyday I'm obsessed
so I actually take this shade first of
all which is called white sand
so you can even just leave your eyes at
this or I think I'm going to apply some
of the gel liner into my waterline okay
I'm then going to take this shade here
which is called snow and when I apply
some of that into the inner corner of my
eye
and then a little bit on my brow bone I
think I'm going to take the new liquid
lipstick by anastasia beverly hills this
is a shade strawberry i got you sent to
me as the light and i'm just been so
excited to use it so i feel like it's
the perfect red shade I'm so excited I
don't actually have a lip liner that
matches this so I'm just going to try
and do this as neat as possible
