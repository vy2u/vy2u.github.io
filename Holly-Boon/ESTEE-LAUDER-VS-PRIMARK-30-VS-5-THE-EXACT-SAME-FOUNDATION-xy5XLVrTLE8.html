channel and hello hi if you're new here
my name is Holly ban so in today's video
I'm gonna be testing out a karmic
foundation that is supposed to be the
exact same as the s in order double
where the proc one is five pounds and
the SD Lord one is around thirty pounds
so yeah this has been going around the
internet so I just wish to try it off
myself and see what I think so I did
pick up this the other day and as you
guys know I used a double work quite
often and so with the estee lauder
double wear you get 30 mil you get 30ml
product and with the Primark one you get
32 mil so you get 32 million the primer
1 which is 5 pounds and in the 30 pound
one you only get 30 mil so you get more
in the palm up bottom which is nuts and
the packaging feels quite similar
they're both kind of like the same sort
of feel obviously this one's a glass
bottle also the when you take the lid
off it's the same no pump so it's the
same with the public one as it is the
Estee Lauder one the lid the same I've
got the shade toffee in the prime up
while they don't have many shades in
this I see anything
and the Estee Lauder one I use the shade
3w 2 which is cashew so the product once
has long wet ultimate matte foundation
double coverage matte finish oil-free
and has an SPF of 15 and the acid order
is says Double Wear stay in place makeup
SPF 10 this is a full coverage as well
and a matte finish so I'm gonna do one
side with the SD noticeable wet and one
side with the Primark and I'm gonna see
my thing but I'm really excited because
this is nuts I love this foundation so
if this one's just as good then I've
read your said must have like 25 pounds
but yeah so I'm gonna first of all prep
my skin
I'm really sorry my eye makeup is hella
crazy today because I just felt really
inspired to use a ton of colors so if
you do want to see how I did this i lurk
then head over to my instagram there'll
be a little mini tutorial on there we
have just I know my eyes a little bit
distracted in this video I'm sorry but
anyway so I'm gonna prep my skin
I'm gonna use my glam glow water burst
moisturizer I love this moisturizer
you're so hydrating it's water-based so
she is oil free and it just feels so
good yeah I'm just like I'm ready to
just use a ton of like personal makeup
looks I was just really inspired today
to do a bunch of color because I found a
movie planet that had that if I be and I
didn't even know that I completely
forgot I even had it and it's just a
colorful part so I was like I really
want to use it okay so like I said I'm
with you Estee Lauder on this side and
Primark on this side but I'm going to
use my sponge for this I normally use my
brush for this foundation I feel like it
works a little bit better but my brushes
are day and I use clean them and it's
just I feel like it's not gonna give it
a fair try so I want a clean sponge shot
I mean okay so for the Estee Lauder side
I'm gonna use my Sigma 3d blender and
for the Primark I'm gonna use a Beauty
Blender so I don't get confused so now
this shape is for the Estee Lauder and
this one's for the front mark so when I
do the Estee Lauder side first the one
thing I hate about this bottle is you
have to kind of pour out in the back of
your hand that end up wasting products
it's really annoying
well I went to pick up the Spanish and I
asked if they had a pump and they said
they didn't so all right Oh God see I'm
gonna do this side first which you see
yesterday in order one and yeah the
foundation is such full coverage and it
dries down matte it just looks really
really nice and because it does have SPF
you do have to pick like bronzes and
powders on top so that you don't get any
flash back and when you take photos and
the Primark one does have a higher SPF
so you probably getting a more flashback
with that one but we can avoid that with
powders anyway so it's fine okay so just
pressed a skin I do you think the shade
much is quite good actually like this
was the only one left
like I ran in then I was like I want to
get the foundation I'm gonna try it
I love the Estee Lauder Double Wear I
really want to see what the difference
is and I ran in and this was the only
color that they had left and I was like
thank you because I needed that okay so
that's the Estee Lauder side as you can
see it's a full coverage and just dry
down matte so yeah that's that side so
now I'm gonna use the Primark on the
other side let me just wipe this off the
back of my hand
okay already I can tell from putting on
the back of my
it's a little bit thicker the formula
than the estimate on the s-1 was a
little bit more runny when you put the
rock yeah this one's a little bit more
thick so I'm gonna use my beat you run
it for this side I should probably put
my mirror this side holy you twat okay
damn this foundation does smell quite
similar to the estimate order one as
well yeah they both smell quite similar
not exactly but they do smell quite
similar okay at the moment I'm not gonna
lie they are very similar I can't really
tell apart from when I put it on the
back of my hand this one seems the
formula seems a little bit thicker but
apart from that okay honestly I cannot
see any difference at all from fine on
the skin
yeah the only difference I felt
straightaway when I put it in the back
of my hand was this one the consistency
of it is a little bit thicker but once
I'm tighten the skin it ties the exact
same and it looks the exact same
I am oh my god I'm not really really
coming free later oh my god I'm going to
my flash photography because the park
one does have a high SPF and when I try
that but I'm going to fish my face when
you can see it I bronze everything else
then we're gonna take a picture and see
what it looks like you won't be able to
tell that was 30 pound and that was 5
pound would you like human girls tell
them when two different foundations at
all well I am very very shocked right
now I didn't expect it to be this
similar the packaging is obviously very
similar I managed to get the shade bang
on they're both the same so if you want
to use me for shade reference Estee
Lauder cashew Primark toffee and it's
perfect perfect shade match by the exact
same color both look exactly the same
I cannot even believe this and if you
drink it I'm actually very like what at
the fart right now for the price of this
one you could get six of these and this
has more product
it says 32 mil and it says 30ml like you
could get six of these for one of the
things like what what green so I can see
I'm gonna use my makeup revolution
Castilian define in the shade c5 you're
so hard when you've already done your
under eye makeup to not that up
that's crazy
you can get six you can get six six of
those foundation from Primark for the
price of one from Estee Lauder and it's
the exact same Wow I read even pay
myself I swear I really pay myself and
what I just press in the concealer and
then I'm just gonna go over with my
eyeshadow brush just to make sure they
don't lose that I have got my color of
my I feel it quite low down so just I
just felt like it yeah so for my Korean
bronze I'm gonna use my concealer from
Barry M this is the all night long full
coverage concealer in the shade hazelnut
I really like this to kind of wet warm
up my face um it's arena I want to try
this with my under eye but I just
haven't found the right shade me it's
been didn't really nicely with that
foundation as well the concealer and
this is rendered in really really well
I feel like when it comes to bronze we
literally just pay for the name of
things like I don't know how like how is
prime our money should do a foundation
the exact same as Estee Lauder for 5
quid like how do you know I mean unless
in order be charging people fake of hand
but I'm gonna to be fair the park in
Cambridge is so nice and neat and tidy
like I hate going in Primark in London
because it's just like chaos and I feel
like everyone just like swatches things
and puts them back and it's just like
people have dipped their fingers and
 whereas that the Cambridge one is
actually really clean and tidy so it's
always
easy to find what you want in there okay
so I'm going to set my face I'm gonna
use my Patrick's tarmac powder I do need
to get some more of my Beauty bakery
powder I ran out and then I went to go
and order online and it was out of stock
and translucent but over hoping it's
back now and I can order it but I'm
gonna set my under eye they set the
middle of my forehead so when I bronze
my face I'm going to use my mineralized
skinfinish and shade dark deep from Mac
and this big fluffy brush from iconic
London this brush is so soft they're
just gonna apply this on top where I
applied that cream like always they drag
down exactly the same like everything
about it is exactly the same apart from
when you pour it on the back of your
hand you can tell it like the prop one
is a little bit thicker but literally
apart from that it's the exact same
foundation no joke no joke right
now okay if you own testing order double
where you need to go get this you can
get six bottles of this for the price a
nice little order six bottles of prymaat
foundation for the price of nesting
order that is just what the
honestly little bits at this point so
I'm going to use my other sizing over
here's a blush palette this is the
radiant palette and when you use this
color here I love this love is perfect
how could it so pigmented they only eat
a tiny bear I always put way too much on
I'm going to use my iconic guns an
illuminator drops in the shade original
it's amazing the back of my hand and
I've been applying this with a brush
like you got I told you in my last video
and everybody to recently started doing
this but it applies it's so much nicer
so I pick up some of the products on
this brush and then I just kind of tap
off the excess on the back of my hand
and then I go and apply it straight to
their base because you can kind of do a
little circular motions as well but kind
of just press it in I cannot believe
this you know I cannot believe it
I'm just gonna line my lips this is my
by Katie lip pencil oh yeah it is cut up
it's in the shade all-natural I'm gonna
apply some butter gloss from NYX this is
in the shade Madeline when I saves I
like glasses I have like a tinted color
but they aren't like really I pegged you
know in there okay so lastly I'm gonna
set my face with my morphe setting spray
this is exactly the same this is exactly
the same as the essence of where don't
care anyone says this is the same
 formula just a tiny bit tiny
tiny bit thicker
it's the Zac so it's try it on the exact
same it looks the exact same
it feels the exact same it it's the
exact same I don't care what I says I
say lot of payin people I thought really
came through and just rang this so I was
like this pramukh one is you get 32
million here this se Lord when you get
30 mil this was 30 pounds this one's
five this was five pounds as you guys
know this is kind of my ride-or-die at
the minute and but that this is my
new thing this is my new Tang I'm gonna
go pick up like so many of these I just
kind of hop if you have a prime up then
you need to get in primer you need to
get this foundation it's 5 pounds you
need to get it honestly I just if you
like a full coverage and if you like the
s noticeable way you're gonna absolutely
love it its exact same but yeah I'm
gonna just take her picture on flash I'm
going to do this side and then this side
because the only difference is the SPF
level when you have SPF in a products it
does obviously protect you from the Sun
when you're outside and but it does
cause flashbacks so yeah the product one
has 15 SPF 15 and the Sonoma has SPF 10
by I'm going to try it anyway but
because I apply power down and I apply
cream bronzer and everything it should
be absolutely fine if you are just going
to wear the foundation it's iron and
then yeah if you take a picture of it
you're putting into your flashback so
you need to part of runs are on
or just don't take a bit job and you
should be fine I'll be I'm gonna just do
this side first I hate this side of my
face
no flashback no flashback all good to
this side again this side all good both
sides both sighs no flashback oh my god
I am so excited let's you I'm so excited
I can't believe this foundation is
exacting this alone oh it's five pounds
thank you Jesus
probably three to come online do you
know what I mean like so did you go to
your prom right and you just can't like
the song sold out or you can't leave the
show that you need and yeah probably
sort that out then you don't online
stores the only thing I will say is a
double wear has a lot more shades and
this one this one doesn't have that many
shade prime I do do things that were
dropped where you can even make a
Spanish and light are where you can make
a foundation darker so if you can't find
a shade in this get some of those little
drops I thinking like too pal see I get
some of those that were drops and try
that but yeah 100% recommended million
percent
no flashback on either side and yeah so
hope you guys enjoyed this video make
sure to give it a thumbs up if you did
and please subscribe and I will see you
in my next video bye everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
