youtube channel if you're new here then
please subscribe I will love you forever
so today I thought I would film a
daytime hello Marissa makeup look super
juhi glowy skin not much on the eyes and
I added a gloss let's just put the
plastic below just it's just everything
with the products will be linked in the
description box below make sure you
follow me on Twitter Instagram and
snapchat that will all be in the
description box as well and but yeah if
you want to find out how i got this
makeup look then please keep watching
and i hope the light is better in this
video i've got two soft boxes i've got
these like really sheet things so that i
get a nice bit of light and under here
under my chin and i tried it backed up i
bought like i bought a new backdrop and
i was like so excited to try it but it
was too metallicky so he just lived a
really weird little delight in my brows
today I'm gonna use the precisely my
brow pencil by benefit and I'm going to
use the Anastasi up over the years brow
gel and I'm first of all I'll just brush
through the brows just to make sure the
hairs are laid down before I apply
products
I've also smudged this mirror today
which I'm annoyed cuz I can't even see
myself properly so smash this mirror I
smashed a lie I don't know what's going
on today I honestly don't know I'm using
this in the shade 6 and I just kind of
first of all underlined but really
really lightly I do have a brighter to
runway channel if you haven't already
seen it so I like to do is first of all
just to only really faint line under my
brows like a guidance lightly just apply
the product like this and then claim it
out and I'm just going to lightly apply
product in the start of my brow if
you're having trouble with eyebrows
growing and stuff then definitely try
vitamin E oil definitely try coconut and
so after that I'm just going to go back
with the brow gel and just set the hairs
again so we are going to start with the
face now so the eyes couldn't gonna do
too much with the eyes so
first of all going to apply an oil and
I'm gonna use my pixie Rose oil blends I
love this stuff so I'm gonna apply a
little bit of this my skin that would be
if I could actually open oh my god I've
done help so tight the aptril okay so
just gonna drop some on the back of my
hand and I'm gonna actually applies to
my face with my Beauty Blender
it smells just amazing it smells so good
since I used that gold glitter on my
eyes I feel like everything she's
covered in good I even have like washed
everything because I spilt some and I
don't know why but it just seems to be
everywhere I'm gonna apply some of the
Fendi a beauty primer on top just kind
of just like smooth out over there is
where just it just adds a bit more
hydration
so foundation I'm going to use the Mac
Studio Fix fluid mix with my Maybelline
fit me matte poreless I just love the
finish of this I just yeah I just love
it so I'm gonna just mix these on my
hand
Rainie just get something like a mix
creams on guys I'm just gonna top this
in my face so then I'm gonna just push
this in with my Beauty Blender when I
apply my foundation I go over it with a
Beauty Blender so many times because I
feel like if you just quickly do it for
meat vendor it doesn't kind of you need
to like really work into the skin
otherwise it just kind of sits on top of
the skin and that's when it can just
look a bit once you have powers I think
I look a bit cakey so I like to make
sure that I really press this foundation
into the skin but it makes so much
difference I mean after I blended in one
foundation with a sponge my arm it
shakes because I do it for so long
so I'm gonna take my face shape brush
rooms away by the 110 and I'm using the
benefit brightening concealer I'm
dipping my brush in this I'm just gonna
apply tiny bit of this under my tire dad
I'm gonna just blend it in with a Beauty
Blender
okay so then I'm going to take my
concealer the NARS radiant creamy
concealer in the shade custard
and then I do like to add a little bit
of the cover FX cream concealer in the
shade light tiniest bit as well because
this gives me a little bit of extra
coverage I need you to sue my under-eye
though not here where I'm gonna bring it
up and I'm gonna bring it on my eyes as
well
okay so then after that I'm going to do
a little bit of cream contour and I'm
gonna use my NYX it's the foundation
stick it's in the shade rich and then I
like to use de frente a foundation brush
to blend in my contour I kind of use it
to kind of blend out the edges and then
I go in with a Beauty Blender just press
over over the BU Brenda
okay so now I'm looking really is shiny
as I'm just full of cream I'm gonna
start setting everything so I'm gonna
use my awesome a translucent powder I'm
just making sure I get rid of the
creases and where is nice
I'm gonna powder my whole face and I
know it sounds crazy but this just how
do is quite lightweight and it's quite
nice so it doesn't feel um it doesn't
feel too much if that makes sense
but every try to do this my face just
last all day I don't have to touch it so
then I'm gonna read on to it the
forehead see I mean it's you're gonna
powder everywhere
so I'm just gonna toss dust everywhere I
prayed that NYX foundation stick with
some bronze on I'm using the Mac
mineralized skinfinish in the shade dark
deep and this brush is from ICONic but
when I look everyone so I always want to
look kind of runs
so now I'm going to do some blush and
I'm gonna use my benefit California is
just like this the brush and weenies and
I'm going to use my it's a weaver 186
powder brush
so I'm just gonna put a tiny bit of
concealer down the front of my nose is
pretty much product I'm just gonna try
and take away some of the product and
I'm just gonna like press that in so now
this skin is looking snatched I'm gonna
start on the eyes and all I am gonna do
is I'm gonna take some bronzer on a
fluffy blending brush and I'm just gonna
apply it in the crease of my eye I'm
just using the mac mineralize skinfinish
and it's a duct tape one that I used on
my skin and I'm just gonna first of all
apply this in the crease I'm using my
Sigma tapered blending brush if you do
use the bronzer on your eye which I
always tend to do and make sure you use
the brunt the same runs as it used on
the face and it just ties everything
together so what I'm gonna do next is
I'm gonna apply a highlight to my lids
I'm going to use this Milani strobe
light de blow so this is a Milani strobe
light they go it's number two so I'm
going to apply this to my lid and I'm
going to use this two to six as a wave a
smudger brush it's really easy to
control the product cuz it's really
small and I'm just gonna try this
highlight to my palate
I'm gonna go back to my blending brush
say I'm gonna use my stealer smudge pot
it's in the shape brown and I'm gonna
just line my lashline with this and I'm
gonna use my 31-7 winged liner brush
from zoeva so if you're going to use a
liner like I do and when you put your
lashes on it just blends in a lot better
I'd go for a brown if you're gonna do it
look like this because if you're going
with black sometimes I can just be a bit
too much like a bit it can look a bit
too hard if you aren't gonna wear
eyelashes because something will just
have really nice eyelashes obviously
jealous if you have really nice and
natural eyelashes and you're just gonna
put some mascara on then you can still
do this step because it will just make
your lashline look a lot fuller
so I am gonna put lashes on because I
like she don't have any no I have like
no eyelashes so I am gonna apply some
mascara face and when you use amazing
big shot skaara
well my eyelashes I'm going to use the
house a brush iconic the light one and
I'm using the House of lashes House of
lashes eyelash glue lashes are still
drying so I'm gonna take some roses are
on this fluffy brush I'm gonna run this
underneath the eyes and lower lash line
my lower waterline I'm gonna add some of
the cover FX this is just a food the
perfect pencil in the shade deep
okay so for my highlight I'm using the
same shade that I used on my lids so I'm
using the Milani strobe light and I'm
gonna just kind of press it on she knows
I'm gonna be highlighted but I don't
want too much today so I'm letting the
NYX suede lip line right in the show
Brown
I'm gonna kinda just shade the whole it
and pretty much data for my liquid
lipstick a recent dose of color
supernatural and then on top of that I'm
going to use some of the dose of colors
desi and Katie collection over-the-top
gloss I love his cross so much and wears
a lot on its iron it's just so bomb then
I want to set my face with the all
nighter setting spray okay okay so that
