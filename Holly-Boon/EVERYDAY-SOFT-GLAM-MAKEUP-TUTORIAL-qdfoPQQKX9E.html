filming this soft glam makeup look just
something that you could wear every
single day and nothing too crazy just
nice and subtle and glamorous I'm
actually do the first impressions of
these makeup brushes that I've got sent
from vanity planet and they've reached
out to me again after this bar video
that I created with the vanity planet
spark it and asked me if I want you to
try their makeup brush in 100% vegan and
cruelty free ot free cruelty free and
we're going to call it say that you know
I mean and so I'm really excited to try
them I've actually used them to make
this makeup look so I'm going to show
you guys what I would use each brush for
etc etc and there's also a link in the
description box below where you can buy
these brushes they're normally $100 but
they're going down down to $30 with the
link in the description box and so they
picked you up again which is so cool and
so you get 70% off so click the link in
description box if you were to get these
brushes but I'm super impressed with
them I feel like brushes are such an
essential part of your care if you've
got a really good set of brushes then it
just makes your life so much easier it's
like really important to have good
brushes I love the fact that they're
cruelty free and they're vegan so I'm
going to show you guys how I use these
to create this makeup look so yeah if
you want to get them click the link in
description box and you can get some
goop set off no I do not get commission
from it or anything like that because I
know those people were saying with the
vanity pup with the vanity planet
sparkle I was getting those commissioned
from it as well I was tell you to buy it
not the case at all so yeah if you only
have them the links and the link is in
the description box and if you liked
this video please give it a thumbs up
and yeah I hope you enjoy the makeup
look so the first question I'm going to
use is this kind of like short really
thin and kind of like a concealer type
brush and I'm going to take my back
ultimate coverage concealer I'm going to
carve out my eyebrows
it's going to take my soft ochre Paint
Pot by Mac and use the same brush and
I'm going to apply this as my eye primer
just all over my lid
going to be using the Too Faced
semi-sweet chocolate palette one of my
absolute favorites and I'm going to take
this fluffy brush from the brush
collection and just this really nice
fluffy brush is so soft so I'm going to
take a shader truffled which is just
this really light brown orange brown sup
shave warm Brown just apply that in my
crease really light you don't want too
much of this
I'm actually going to be taking my gold
deposit by Mac which is a mineralized
skinfinish I'm just going to apply this
all over the lid
and taking this like short shader brush
and from the collection I'm going to
take shade coconut cream from this
palette I'm just going to apply that to
my brow bone
I'm just going to take my mascara is
going to apply some some rashes where I
apply some fake ones this is a scar from
the bomb it's called mad lash and then
flashes I'm going to use the Chelsea
lashes by backstage lashes and these are
just kind of like more kind of everyday
not so dramatic
like boys wear
so Chrome out as always I'm going to use
the Smashbox primer water it it she just
ran out about one so I just got another
one obsessed with this works for both
skin types it's just really refreshing
so I recommend getting this if you
haven't already tried it
and then I'm just going to apply some of
the backup back like Thor as well really
like this this is really really good if
you've got dry skin as well I don't have
dry skin but I feel it when I apply this
and then I use the George my little
foundation it's really really nice
combination so for foundation I'm going
to use the Giorgio Armani luminous silk
foundation and this is in shade 6.5 so
if I can see that I'm going to use the
Maybelline fit me concealer kill me now
if you want I know you're sick of
hearing about it but I do not care I
have a found one better than this
just going to set that with my trying to
do some pro it up and rmsea I'm just
going to bake my chin cuz my chin is so
really so now I'm just going to warm up
my face as always I'm going to use the
Mac give me some so they take this
fluffy brush from the brush collection
I'm loving these brushes so far
so I'm going to use the hot mess contour
palette
I'm obsessed users do I I'm going to
take this shade here which is number six
and we take this angled contour brush
which comes with the kit
I think my Sigma highlight brush I'm
going to take shade too which is the
banana powder type shade in the middle
I'm just going to run this underneath
here I take this really short shader
brush I would call it I'm going to take
the shade peanut butter from this
palette and just run that under my eyes
and then I'm really just going to apply
some mascara to my bottom lashes
okay so I'm now gonna highlight which is
my favorite part of the whole entire
makeup look so much she's going to take
the Smashbox primer water I'm just going
to spray this in my face going to
highlight with a fan brush and I have a
highlight in your fan brush in such a
long time and I used to absolutely love
doing this so excited this is the fan
brush from over to the brush collection
and I'm going to take this Kiko
eyeshadow which is in 208 which I'm
absolutely obsessed with lately
oh my god I forgot how good a fan
brushes to apply highlight oh my god
why have I stopped being a fan brush
okay I'm sorry I'm never ever going back
now fan brush my super lips I'm going to
take the Too Faced melted chocolate
lipstick in chuckle honey
and taking my lip voltage I'm just going
to apply some of this on top finish look
that's my everyday makeup look if you
want to sleep a soft brown makeup look
for every single day
