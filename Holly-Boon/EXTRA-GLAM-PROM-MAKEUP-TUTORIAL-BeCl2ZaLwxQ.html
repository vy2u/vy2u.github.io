channel and hello if you're new here
welcome hi my name is Holly Boone so in
today's video I'm gonna do a prom makeup
look I know the prom in the UK is sort
of I dunno if you have asked me to do a
prom look so that's we're gonna do this
is gonna be so glam so so glam something
that's gonna go with every eye color and
also every dress color because I wanted
to keep it kind of like neutral and
brown and then like really cloud with
glitter and stuff because then I feel
like everybody can everybody can wear it
you know I mean so I'm going to start
with my brows because I always start
with them and I'm gonna use my NYX brow
pencil in the shade black because this
is a micro prep and so as my favorite
I'm just gonna start but I'm shining my
brow and then I'm going to just follow
the natural shape of the brow and then I
just start to fill it in there's always
so many aeroplanes flying over this
house like it's constant it's so
annoying I cannot wait to move out and
get a proper like to mess it up because
I can't fit probably like more lights
and stuff in here I can't fit any more
lights but as soon as I get out of this
house out of this room I'm literally
gonna have to so much light in its gonna
do so much well wait
I'm gonna use my Maybelline instant age
rewind concealer in the shade nude to
cover up my brows you wouldn't believe
what this set up this is not right now
basically I smashed my lens my my
drop down it broke and I went to go and
get it fixed and she said like there's
no point even pains get it fixed because
it'll cost you more than it's worth and
also she said that it would take like 4
weeks and obviously I couldn't wait for
weeks for lens so I was like okay like
I'll just buy another one and then she
was I because we don't sell that one set
for it you have to buy it with the
camera what I would the actual camera
and I didn't want to do that because I
already have the actual camera you know
I mean so I was like I don't wanna do
that
and then she sold me this other lens
she's like this one worked us is fine
you're just up to zoom in a little bit
more it's like a wide wider lens so
there's me like yeah that's fine I'll
skip that one you know and then I've
using it now and it doesn't zoom in
close enough so yeah you wait to see
this now because I'll edit it and I'll
crop it but like you can see in my
bedroom door you can see everything it's
just it's too wide and I can't get
zoomed in close enough so yeah you know
but you might see that because I'm gonna
crop it and hopefully it works and I can
never have much luck when I go in that
camera shop last my went there some
woman who sold me this camera she's like
yeah this is said the best cover to film
with it's so so good and I was like okay
like so I know anything about cover so I
was like cool like I would just get that
there and then I remember I tried to
court record on it and it was like the
worst cameras recorded like video is on
and then I went back and I was like to
the guy in the shop I was like oh this
woman's always to get this company other
day she said it's like the best one for
filming videos he was like no he was
like it's really good for like if you're
a blogger and you want to take pictures
and stuff
he was like it's amazing for that but we
wouldn't recommend that video and I was
like okay can because the cameras are
not cheap and I wanted to return it and
you wouldn't let me because he said I'd
used it and I was like okay what can I
exchange it for something not a
different camera and he was like yeah
but yeah anyway don't have much luck
with cameras I'm gonna put some brow gel
in my brows my undersize you've ever
yours on the only one I use it's the
only one that keeps my brow hairs in
place all day I'm going to set my lids
with translucent powder because it's
concealer it's not actual a shadow base
so we just won't it doesn't work for me
funny I said it so just miss it this way
as well you're missing a translucent
powder this brush is the Sigma F 79
brush
these airplanes are really doing my head
in can you not just garden route please
you go a different way so alone we
really are about to go from zero to
hundred like I literally look at my hair
I just rolled out of it okay so I'm
going to use my Jaclyn hill morphe
palette and the first shade I'm gonna
use is this one right here my transition
color I'm gonna use this one and I
believe my sleep my diffuse crease a 38
brush I'm just gonna place just above my
crease so yeah I want to keep this quite
neutral but warm and do like a really
glam like glitter and winged and that
kind of stuff and big lashes because
then I feel like this can go with
anyone's prom dress and everyone's eye
color I wanted to do like a colorful
prominent but then I thought that's like
limiting people some people like they're
wearing a certain dress color won't be
able to do that so and I know some of
you up on me doing your own makeup in
France where people that I like 15 16 I
was so good at makeup these days like
when I was that age I was terrible like
I didn't wear makeup a prom and it was
horrific it was so bad my foundation
looked great look at this didn't match
me at all it was just a mess it was a
hot mess I'm losing the wind today with
these aeroplanes I can't do next
and I'm gonna use is this one right here
just the one below the one I just used
and I'm gonna use my two three four some
blocks Miki shape brush from zoeva I'm
just gonna pop this in my crease I'm
just gonna press it on and then blend it
out on his own then I'm gonna take the
Sigma e30 8 brush
do you ever feel like sometimes that
people just don't get your humor and
they think that you're just soaked and
they take you serious and you have to
get up Jake in like did you ever feel
like that
like I say things sometimes and people
look at me I
I'm not taking I'm taking I'm taking I
like to exaggerate I want to people
exaggerate it's just for like a joke you
know I mean and if you want to get me I
want my side right now and I'm taking
next I'm gonna take this color right
here just above the black mm I'm gonna
use this little brush which is my blank
canvas Etan brush the best a little tiny
blending brush ever I'm gonna put this
in the crease and the outer corner you
can always see what I make on too much
your color dress to say you look like
you're wearing up your TV blue type of
dress you could do like really nice
Terry is I've got glitter and then just
a like a nude lip and that would just
sit so a bomb that looks so so good
quite if I could go back in the prom
again I would my makeup would be so
 down maybe so good I didn't even
wear false lashes to my prom like I just
worry about mascara I looked a hot mess
any of you watching there so any of you
that are subscribed to me can you tag me
in your prom pictures on Instagram
because I really see weak eyes where I
really what I said I love it I love this
Jaclyn hill planet more few planets one
of my faves you use it probably 90% of
the time she's got so many colors in it
I would well but whenever I go away like
we're gonna head out
I'm going away I always hate this part
of me so no Jack did you get so much
like stick online is so much hate but I
really love her like I think she's so
nice and don't know I don't know why she
gets so much next thing I'm gonna
carve out the crease I'm gonna use my P
Louise base for this and I'm gonna use
my Mac 195 brush
next I'm going to apply this pigment
this is the Peter wheeze pick mine in
the shade gold digger it's a like a gold
reflector buckle rose gold as well as
have a mixture of two so nice so I'm
gonna apply some glitter glue quickly
I'm going to use my ash cosmetics
glitter glue
I'm gonna pop that on top and then I'm
gonna apply the glitter I use in my Mac
it's really fine but it's really nice
hey I'm going to just pull some a bit
further out as well next thing I'm going
to do is we're going to add a wing wind
liner so we'll use my NYX final liquid
liner and then I'm going to go over it
with a black eyeshadow to make it matte
and make it more black
okay I'm just going to do my other wing
up camera and I'll be back in a sec okay
so just finished my other wing of camera
and I'm going to use my Sigma gel liner
in the shape wicked which is black and
I'm just going to apply some on top
water and this is the es6 wound liner
brush as well i love this brush hours
papers everything on a winged liner just
start getting bigger and bigger and
bigger and bigger
and yeah this side is so much better the
wings and it for lashes i'm using the
lily lashes in the style sydney these
have been my favorite lately love these
are so dramatic
they're so fluffy I love them and I'm
just using my house of blushes eyelash
glue the black one I'm just gonna let
them dry down okay so I'm gonna put my
skin I'm gonna use my glam glow water
burst hydrating moisturizer just gonna
apply some of this first my skin has
been like so strange the last few months
it's like one minute is only in next
minute it's like a bit dry like I can't
keep up a bit on his neck had a spot in
my hairline there I wish you hate
getting on there that hurts so bad and
getting on your lip liner that
hurts I'm just gonna add some I serum
under my eyes cuz his house just stopped
my concealer creases and I missed
pro-collagen eye treatment yeah like if
you find that your concealer crease is
at an eye cream or an eye serum on
underneath
okay primer I'm gonna use my tongue now
and why I felt primer I love this
promise so much memory just don't even
use any other one I'm so obsessed I'm
just gonna replace with this little mac
stipple brush I kind of recommend this
primer enough if you are oily or if your
makeup doesn't last very long just keep
some makeup on all today
just stop you can get oily as well so
this primer is also really really good
for minimizing your pores as well let's
stick my lashes on quick
yeah these luscious Sydney really good
each year by everything yeah yeah brand
no question but does anybody put their
eyelash glue on there to I and then
stick blush on or does nobody do that is
that things okay so I'm gonna stop my
foundation I'm gonna use my Maybelline
24 hours stay in the shade caramel beige
and I'm gonna apply it with this little
stipple brush my which is the same one
that I used for primer I used to mix
this one with the shade form and I've
still got a town from my holiday which
was about a month ago I know yeah this
is just so it as much as but when I add
in that for sometimes it makes it a
little bit cray it's weird how people
would say like oh your foundation is a
much of phase but like I don't want too
much my face I've no one a much my body
my face is always lighter than my body
upright that's the same with everyone if
one's face is always lighter than their
body so you always want to match your
foundation to your neck not your actual
face otherwise you're gonna have a
lighter face and then your body will be
like more turn I like to buff it in with
this brush and then I'll go over it with
my Beauty Blender just to make sure
there's no like brush mop I love this
color on my eyes well it's so nice so
for my concealer I'm gonna use my
Maybelline eraser eye concealer I wish
use my Laura Mercier 1ba I'm gonna
switch out because I know he's that was
I mean it's probably getting a bit Alina
this was one of my favorite drugstore
concealers and I took the sponge off
that's why am i using brush supplier
then I'm gonna blend this in with my
sponge do you know that Maybelline has
come up with more shades of this
concealer which is good I said I think
there's enough shade so you can find
your shade in it definitely try it
because it's like one of the best
drugstore casinos in my opinion it's
just such a good coverage and it blends
in really well yeah it definitely need
to bring up more shades a bit next I'm
gonna use my Laura Mercier translucent
powder I'll set my under eye then set my
chin and my smile and eyes
okay I'm gonna use my berry and hazelnut
concealer to contour my nose like this
on the front of my nose all the way to
the end because I hate my nose why I
find it weird will people say to me oh
you've had a nose job and I'm like I
definitely have it like if I have I
definitely need a refund because I if
your nose is not an eye sight I don't
want my name I don't know people say
that I'm like really
he actually taking the beer so okay so
we don't even sealer to dry down for a
bit and then it'll be easier to blend in
because this is prom makeup and this
makeup Misa last a long time and I'm
gonna set the rest of my face I'm going
to use my mac studio fix powder Danish
8nc 43 and I'm just gonna press the song
yeah if I want my makeup to last like a
long long time then I will set all of my
face the powder and c43 isn't like the
foundation shade and c43 and 0.3 it's
obviously quite dark and as you can see
this is quite light so I wouldn't order
online I'd go in store if you want to
get this powder because yeah it's not
like a reference to your foundation
color phone essence that's what I'm
gonna use my favorite which is the Mac
mineralized skinfinish in the shade dark
date this is a little bit red but I like
it it's my favorite
I used to use give me son I might go
back to give me some because it's a
little
later sometimes this one does look a
little bit too right on me because it is
maybe chewed on I'm gonna take some
translucent powder down I'm gonna apply
this just underneath there
I didn't contour but I don't want my
bronzer to be too far down so I'm just
going to clean it up okay I'm going to
blend in my knowledge before it
literally dries and then I can't believe
it
and I've just got the t-strap salmon I
love Blake take my little beauty been
done I'm just gonna press it in for like
I say if that makes sense
always on okay so I'm just gonna apply
some concealer I'm going to use my Laura
Mercier good back in with concealer down
the bridge little the tip just up the
sides okay so I'm gonna apply some
translucent powder put the size and set
that and we stay down the bridge then
I'm going to use this brush from iconic
London and the reason the morphe front
or celebutant ones from contour in one
and I'm gonna just go over that cream
with powder cream didn't really work
very well so let's see what powder looks
like okay so I'm just gonna dust off
this powder underneath there okay so I'm
gonna finish off my under eye and I'm
gonna set my Sigma e30 eight brush I'm
gonna take this color right here then
I'm gonna go to that dark dark his color
that I used which is just a bottle of
black color as well I love this go there
on my eyes so noise okay so I'm gonna
place some Jo liner in my bottom
waterline I'm going to use the Sigma one

mascara because if I put the glitter
underneath won't be able to wear bottom
mascara I think when I wear no I mean
