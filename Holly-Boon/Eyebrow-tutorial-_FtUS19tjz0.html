this video and so this side I've already
done my eyebrows and this side happen so
yeah and the reason why I do fill my
eyebrows is because do you feel like it
just gives them more definition and it
just looks a lot better and excuse my
hair because I'm having a really really
bad hair day so yeah you want to find
out how to do my eyebrows keep watching
so to start with I'm just following the
natural line of my eyebrow so I'm just
following my natural shape i'm using the
anastasia beverly hills dipbrow pomade
in medium brown and this is just a
random and good brush from superdrug it
was like three pounds
so I am just following the natural shape
still just underlining my eyebrow I am
just going to fill that in I'm not going
to go too far across just because I
don't like the start of my eyebrow to be
really hard
so now I am just going slightly above my
natural eyebrow shape and just to mean
what I bar a little bit thicker and I'm
not going to go crazy and go like too
much above my eyebrow because that will
just sit ridiculous I'm also doing this
just to give myself more of an arch as
well and because I do prefer more of an
arched eyebrow rather than too straight
you
so now I'm just wiping any excess
product off the brush I'm just going to
lightly lightly brush through my eyebrow
hairs at the start of my eyebrow I don't
like it to be too harsh so I'm just
doing this really gently
I just think it gives more of a natural
eyebrow look rather than really really
harsh and say yeah
so now I'm just taking my conceder from
my Anastasia Beverly Hills cream contour
kit I'm just using this under my eyebrow
just to neaten it up it makes it look a
lot more sharp and so if you want flakey
eyebrows and definitely do this
also I will make sure that I link all of
the products that I've used below if you
do have any questions at all just make
sure you comment below and I will try
and answer your questions thanks guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
