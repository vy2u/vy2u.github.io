youtube channel
I thought obviously on a video today on
my favorite foundation I don't have like
well what's going on here is TV no I
don't have many favorite foundations
from very far see I'm very fussy so
these are the foundations that I love
and I use on a regular basis so yeah so
the first one we talked about is the
hourglass expand ation this is pricey I
know the price of this and for the
amount of product that you get is
actually really bad very excessive but I
can't help it okay the foundation is so
nice it's so nice it's basically
buildable to as full coverage as you
 want violet and cakey because
it's just pure pigment you can layer it
alone era it was it cakey
that's what I've got this foundation
also I'm not a huge fan of stick
foundations but with this one is through
so creamy I started using a kabuki brush
to blend our I love the finishings
foundation it's like a full coverage a
satin finish is like a satin finish its
own as I thought my favorite finish on a
foundation and like I said you can build
up build up as much as you want and it
doesn't look cakey but the only problem
with this is it is expensive and you
don't get much product for your money
which is annoying so if you are going to
get a foundation just use the price
special occasions and that when you're
going to go on a night out or when
you're just like this over the weekends
or something I wouldn't use this is an
everyday foundation because it is
expensive and ain't nobody explained 45
pounds of this all the time anyway I use
the shade golden tan if any of you guys
are wondering also one thing with that
foundation it does go in my smile line
so that if anybody else has that so what
I have to do is whenever applied it is
to basically do this and apply powder
here why did it so that it doesn't then
going much like crease and my smile
lines is that make sense but I love that
foundation so much I find it long
wearing and I love the finish of it and
buildable coverage and really creamy
easy to send out I love it
so yeah if you've got the spare money
then get it into shoes it's special
occasion so the next one is my favorite
drugstore combo I spoke about this one
hundred million times I'm sorry if just
like me you'll figure myself because I
feel new here you'll be like okay cool
but if you've been here providing the
right bitch we look anyway I love this
combo so much if the L'Oreal True Match
mixed with the Laurie OH total cover the
reason why I mix the two is because this
was not as full coverage as I would like
but I love the finish of this foundation
and this one is really really thick and
it's too much for me so I like to mix or
two and then I get a full coverage satin
finish which I love and so I use this
one in the shade golden amber yeah so
and I don't know what number is because
it's rubbed off but I'll link it below
anyway and this one is in the shade
amber so if you are super oily and you
want a full coverage foundation and I
would 100% recommend trying this one
from drugstore the L'Oreal total copper
because it is very matte and very full
coverage so if you are oily then
definitely definitely definitely try
this if you're like me and you're just
really in a to zone and dancing place is
quite normal
then I do like to mix it too but I do
have to set my t-zone with loads of
power and I last abatements areas
because if not throughout the day I will
start getting oily and looking a bit wet
like looking sweaty so I do have to
apply a powder on top and make sure that
I bake but this is like more of a good
daytime if you want like a full coverage
every day so the good convoys have every
day because there's only expensive and
you get a lot of products if you're
missing the tin because fingers are like
seven pound this one's about the same
and you mix them together and this is
these two will last you for ages so this
is a good drugstore products to have for
every single day I think if you are more
on the dry side
then I would recommend trying this it is
suitable to kind of not reoffend
coverage more like a medium coverage and
but it's such a nice foundation
especially drugstore and it looks the
finish on it is so nice on its own like
sometimes on my skin's you can really
I don't feel like I need full coverage I
will just use this one on its own and I
do like it
the only problem I find with the Loreal
foundations is trying to find shades
like they don't have a huge variety of
shades which is really annoying because
well I like super tanned like we went a
hoedown and got really turned I could
have wear this because it is at ground
makes it look way too light a sick
stupid so that's annoying in that sense
the shade range but yeah if you want a
good drugstore combo a drugstore
foundation and try these two okay so the
next one I wanna talk about I don't
actually have any because I've
completely run out of it and haven't
used it in such a long time but it will
always be a favor of mine and that's the
Mac Studio Fix fluid I love that
foundation so much it only problem I
have of it is that it does oxidize on me
but I think it's because I am quite oily
so when it makes it that whereas in my
skin it tends to go very dark so I apply
the foundation and then after like an
hour way it will just get darker and
darker so that's a problem that I have
with that foundation but I love the
finish it's a good medium to full
coverage the shade range is really
really good I love the finish of it I
just that is always going to be a huge
favor of mine if you do have really skin
and you go to get that foundation then I
would recommend for doing a shade
lighter because in my oxidizer new as
well but I don't know it just depends on
the person it was oxidizing everyone if
you are oily one thing unit you should
do if your if you want your makeup to
last all day I've been getting more and
more really recently which is so weird
because I never used to get this
audience I've always been a tiny bit but
not as badly out in a minute like my
skin is and so or any lately and what I
tend to do is I set my primer so i prime
my skin which is why did today and I set
like literally all here all on my
forehead all on my chin just put tons
and tons of powder I like quite a lot
because I'm very oily at the minute so I
put loads of powder on before my
foundation and it wasn't from a
foundation concealer I will bake my
under-eye bake it and bake it as well
because I just have to be otherwise
literally my makeup would start to slide
off after a few hours so if your soup
oily that's a trick you can do is make
sure you set your primer I use a
translucent power drugs you don't any
flashback but just yeah get a transition
powder and that's something that I
recommend you to do and if you are dry
these that foundation will still work
for you the Mac Studio Fix fluid it's
still nice it's not completely matte I
don't think it dries a little bit like
kind of like semi-matte I'd say so what
you want to do is just apply a ton of
moisturizer underneath or just get a
really hydrating primer i underneath and
that foundation will still work for you
but yeah I love that foundation so much
and you know what I actually kind of
want to go back to it I kind of want to
try it again because I the problem I
find and a lot of you might find is that
if you use the same foundation over and
over and over again that you stick to
one foundation use over and over over
your skin gets your skin gets used to it
and it just doesn't look as nice anymore
light starts to not look as good and I
just feel like my skin just gets used to
one foundation and then I've used it say
that for a month everything within it
and then I'm like okay my skin doesn't
look the same as what it like when I
first started wearing the foundation and
I think yet you just can't get your skin
just get used to foundations and you
need to switch it up I just have a
couple of favorites and just switch
between them because you're justyou're
notice a difference so I'm going back to
it because I've worn it in a while and
yeah I don't have any minute to show you
but that is a Rico foundation for both
skin types but like I said if you are
dry to apply really hydrating primer or
like a good moisturizer underneath and
if your oil II just make sure you kind
of set your primer and seacret is owned
or wherever you okay so this is the last
foundation that I love and the reason
why I'm talking about these certain
foundations because these are
foundations that I always go back to I
don't have many that I love love love
love love I'm still trying to find more
foundations that I love but these ones
will always be ones that I will go back
to like I will always repurchase and
I'll always be like yep I'm going to
them well at Wednesday 35 here but I
these are yeah okay so the last
foundation I want to talk about is the
Too Faced Born This Way Foundation and
this is medium to full coverage and it's
oil
I love this foundation two-faced send me
the whole collection and I've never
tried it and I was like oh I might as
well just try it I didn't know it as a
medium to full coverage I always thought
it was like a light coverage before I
tried it and now I'm like this is like
going to be one of my favorites ever I
feel like this one is pretty much this
combination in this bottle and the shade
range of this is really really good they
have so many shades aren't 25 different
shades I think they have in this so yeah
these two mixed together are pretty much
this one so if you want a drugstore
version a less expensive version of this
and get these two it's going to cost you
less and you just gonna have to mix or
two but this one the shade range is
wider so if you can't get these in your
shade then just go to this one because
it's exactly the same at this combo but
this one's higher-end and this one's got
more shades just what I mean
yeah medium to full coverage you can
build up to full coverage so you can
these two and like if you want more full
coverage add more of this one and
increases the total cover this one super
full coverage if you want not as much
coverage and don't add as much as this
one in just add more this one in just
one time
Co with this one if you are then you are
ready to set and if you're really oily
then apply powder underneath the
foundation I put your foundation on
today and I like I said this morning I
put powder on underneath this on top of
my primer as been my foundation and this
goes on really nice on top of the powder
and it looks nice isn't it Katie and our
powdered again on top as well because
the only problem I find with this is
because when I go to start and finishes
and I'm super oily now at the minute
what I get oily again after sort of like
a few hours which is really annoying so
you are going to have to set your primer
but this is a beautiful foundation yes
well I'd apply this on with a Beauty
Blender or response like this applies a
lot better with these two I like to
apply again with the sponge and with the
studio fix fluid I prefer a sponge as
well because there are liquid
foundations but with cream foundations I
prefer to use a buffing brush kabuki
brush cement and I just think it gives a
better finish when you pop it in but
with liquid foundations I produce
and I think you get the more coverage
that way so yeah those are my top
foundations so there's a couple of
drugstore in there this one's very
expensive but I can't help but love this
and this one and the Studio Fix fluid so
yeah that's my favorite foundations I
