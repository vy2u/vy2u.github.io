a quick video about my top 10 favorite
lip colors because loads of you always
asked them a snapshot like what lipitor
is that I'm going off that color bomb
over I'm also going to let you know if
you can get them in the UK where I got
them from but I just thought I would
quickly make this video so I hope you
all enjoy it and so they're pretty much
all nudes Brown's dark nudes pinks
that's pretty much all I ever wear so
I'm gonna start with I was gonna start
with Dyson cutters I've got three dose
of colors ones I apps that you love so
the first one I absolutely love is the
dose of colors chocolate wasted liquid
lipstick I use this in my Kourtney
Kardashian tutorial and which is a
really gorgeous dark brown shade it just
goes so well like you've got dark brown
eyes and you just did a couple on smokey
eye it looks really lush is that pretty
one of my absolute favorites and also
I'm gonna swatch these on my hand so you
guys can see what the colors look like
as well and so I saw just one now
actually so this one is chocolate wasted
so just a dark chocolate brown and the
next one I want to talk about is those
of colors desert suede probably describe
it it's a nude but it's like took a gray
type news it's just a really nice
gorgeous almost color from a morphe type
of color move more whether you call it
so that's this color here which is
desert suede and then the next one I
want to talk about some basic lines this
one is actually a lip gloss this one is
called Bellini I recently got this
probably only like a month ago and I was
really impressed a bit because it's
obvious you summery nice pinky glossy
color and the reason why I rest of it is
because normally of course is it hearts
of mine glosses that actually have a
good color pigmentation and they're not
just a little bit pigmented and this one
is super light you wouldn't even need to
wear lipstick underneath this cuz it's
really pigmented and that one called
Bellini
and I do actually order these from
straight from America
I've ordered it's been two orders that
I've done from there and I haven't been
luckily or I hope not at the moment
anyway I have enough sheep in charge any
import tax on them and delivery wasn't
even bad I think it was only like seven
pounds for the delivery and as well I
was so shocked at how quick they came
they came up in like a week and a half
which was really really good considering
they came from America so yeah I
absolutely loved I suppose liquid
lipsticks and lipglosses so next I'm
going to talk about are the Too Faced
melted chocolate lipsticks so this one
is called chocolate honey and this one
is chocolate cherries so this one's
obviously more like a dark brownies red
shade and this one's like a really nice
just this pears amazing with the mac
strip-down lip liner it's basically that
color but in a liquid lipstick type form
this isn't like a matte liquid lipstick
this is like it's not really a gloss
diva it's kind of like a cream like a
creamy lipstick so I always watched it
so you can see this one is chocolate
honey
no chocolate honey isn't it she's so
hard to get hold of and I got sent this
from America this was sent to me this
color also this color I know you can't
get this color on Debenhams
online if you're in the if you from the
eco know you can get that I don't know
if they do it in the store or anywhere
in any governments or anything like that
I'm not sure but this one these two both
sent to me from America so I don't know
where you can get this in the UK which
is kind of annoying but yeah and this
one chocolate cherries I'll swatch this
one as well so you guys can see really
nice ready
Brown gorgeous obsessed that's this
shape right here
so next I'm going to talk about the
Kylie Jenner liquid lipsticks so I got
hold of these when they first came out
and I got I don't know how I managed to
do it because I know they start up so
quick I wasn't expecting to even get
hold of any but I did so I was bought
then and I love these two shows I live
for these two shades I've got candy K on
right now and most people think these
colors are quite similar but they're
really not are you all watching on my
hand so this one's Dolce K so I swatch
this one for you so that one there is
Dolce K which is more of a brownie news
rather than a pinky nude
whereas Kandy K is a lot more pink I'll
show you they are a lot different and
they smell like literally candy so that
one's candy K as you can see don't choke
a candy cane
they're actually a lot different but I
love them I mean these are the only two
that I've actually purchase from how I
want you to get the true brown K but I'm
staying around laser cleanser so almost
identical it's a true brown K so I
didn't really see the point of me
ordering it from America and paying more
money when I can get it the same color
somewhere else um but yeah I absolutely
love these and I haven't found any
colors that are similar to these I've
tried out so many I can't even tell you
I purchased this one from Stila cause my
ex called back he because I thought it'd
be quite similar to Kandy K but when it
came it's actually a lot more morphe
purpley time zone so it's actually
nothing like it and I have actually H
struggled to find any that are the same
colors of colors as these so yeah
so yeah anyway next I want to talk about
stealer I've got this from dat BAE or
cult video comment which one that's
hanging up in the UK it's a gorgeous
person E
Rossiter color and I am obsessed it's
really really nice the liquid form it
doesn't really dry your lips are
anything like that and so that's that's
trade right there this is a bit more
personally than candy okay that's candy
K and that's Kentucky I think BAC I I
might be saying it wrong I don't know
but as you can say as you can see
they're like almost similar but not
really that was a lot more perfect I was
more pink
I thought they would be the same but
they're not so the last two that I
wanted to talk about from Oprah
cosmetics now I was sent these for free
from America so I don't actually know
where you can get these in the UK if
anybody knows we can get is from the UK
please write in the description box
below because I know loads of people
have asked me where you can get hold of
these and I honestly don't know I've had
a look and I can't really find anywhere
we can get hold of these in the UK which
is annoying I know being from the UK
it's enlightenment I trying to get hold
of good makeup I mean the UK range of
makeup is just not fast enough we don't
have enough choice so we always have to
order from America and it's just but
anyway these are the two guys that I
love and one's called to buy and ones
called Makar so this one to buy it's
really really really like actually I was
quite surprised on the website didn't
look as light but when I tried it on I
was absolutely obsessed today it's
really really really really light gray
type tone nudie shade but it does look
gorgeous especially if you put gloss on
top of this that's what I've been doing
and I love it
so I think like that and then this one
maca is very
he goes well with Mac spice lip liner as
well bless that traitor
so that is all of my favorite lipstick
it's my favorite liquid lipsticks of all
time I always go back to these shades
these are just my go-to shades I don't
really have any bright shades that I
love I find it hard to climb rates that
I really like but I want to get hold of
the kylie jenner is it marriage okay the
red one
it looks insane okay it's at the paper
right so I really want to try and hold
it back because I've struggled to find
my tree nice red shade so yeah I hope
you guys enjoyed this video it was a
little bit random but I thought would be
helpful for you guys because loads of
you always ask me about my lip colors so
yeah I hope you all really enjoyed it
