I haven't been this excited for a launch
in a hot minute I haven't been this
excited and so long I can't remember the
last time I got so excited about launch
so yeah anyway I'm out of rack because I
was so excited to film it um yeah if you
want to find out how i got this makeup
look and you want to find out what about
the products and what i think about them
then keep on watching so the first
product is the pro filter instant
retouch primer I'm obsessed with this
packaging by the way I think it looks so
luxurious and this is a soft matte
primer it says it's a shine stop in
pause diffusing primer that smooths the
way it's a better foundation application
and longer way with an instant retouch
effect and you get 32 milliliters okay
so next I picked up the foundation and I
got the shade 300 it says it's the
ultimate photo field site and it comes
in forty shades forty
shades can we will just give stop what
you're doing and give RiRi a round of
applause and it's a soft matte long wear
foundation with buildable medium to full
coverage and and you get 32 millilitres
okay so this is the lip gloss my lip
gloss is poppin my lip gloss is cool
sorry how to do that anyway so it says
it's fancy glow it's an explosive shine
that feels as good as it looks
the ultimate got to have it lip gloss
some explosive shine that feels as good
as it looks in one universe the road's
nude shade I don't know why I said about
that and you get ten Miller layers so
next in my
Barsky I put these matchsticks and I've
picked up the shade French vanilla mocha
and truffle and they are a magnetized
makeup stick in a long wet light as
matte formula to conceal correct contour
and touch-up and they come in 20
different shades next okay picked up
this blotting powder and this is a
universal blotting powder that absorbs
shine and diffuses the look of pores for
an instant filtered look on the flier
okay then I picked up this killer what
freestyle highlight duo so I got the
shave me money and hustler baby so me
money is a soft champagne Sheen and
hustler baby is a supercharged peachy
champagne shimmer and he says it's
weightless long-wear cream powder hybrid
highlighters that ranged from subtle day
glow to insanely it's supercharged
I swear I give myself headache trying to
do this voiceovers but anyway I picked
up the kilowatt freestyle highlight are
in the shade trophy wife and this is a
3d hyper metallic gold it's a very
pigmented pigmented yellow gold and it's
got glitter in it but I'm not I'm not
mad about that I love it I think it's
bomb and I can't wait for her to come
out with more shades hopefully okay so
I'm so excited to try out these products
this is like a complete first
impressions I literally ordered them all
online and I was waiting all to come I
ordered like a few and then I way back
on the website ordered more than ordered
more I just I couldn't stop myself so
I've ordered like pretty much everything
the only things that I don't have are
the cream blush and also the cream
shimmer Stix
I don't have those either but everything
else I have so I'm so so excited to try
these products so I'm gonna start with
my face and I've already done my
eyebrows I've put on a shadow base and I
put a bit of brown in the crease because
I want to use one of the highlighters on
my lids so we're gonna do the face first
so I'm gonna first of all use the primer
to prime my skin so I look she haven't
even just watched any of these
I haven't done anything so I'm like
soaked sigh okay
okay is that it feels kind of like a
cream if as I could mooster Iser it
doesn't really feel like a sticky primer
or anything like that you might've just
feels like a moisturizer but if it was
really really hydrating it feels really
nice okay so this primer is called the
soft macro filter so it does dry matte
but it does feel still first hydrate in
he doesn't feel that completely matte
but if there's a nice furry ass it feels
really soft so for foundation I picked
up two shades because I redid know what
shade I was because obviously I picked
this online so I did first of all order
this shade which is in the shade 216 and
then I realized that 260 was going to be
way too light but on the website when
you go to match yourself all the shades
it weighs after than what they are so I
did pick up the shade 300 which I think
will be about my shade and then if it's
too dark I'll just mix it with a bit
this one but honestly I feel like if
you're going to match this up on the
website be careful because the shades do
look darker than what they are like like
I said this one 300 on the website looks
so dark but in person it's not a dark so
I'm just gonna show you case it says to
shake well and I'm going to try out the
sponge and I'm gonna try out the brush
so I'm gonna do one side of my face with
the brush and one side with the sponge
and see what I prefer I dunno we like
this one cuz if let you get more
coverage but we'll see anyway so this is
a soft matte long wet foundation so on
this side of my face I'm going to apply
with the brush
okay so what I might do is actually just
dock this with my finger first of all
and then I'm gonna blend it in with the
brush okay so it definitely definitely
oxidizes on me
as you can see where I kind of already
blended it in here it's a different
color it's a lot darker than this where
I've just applied here so it definitely
does oxidize on me but I mean a lot of
foundations oxidize with me because I
don't know I think it something dude
that was on my skin when they mix with
certain foundations they it tends to
oxidize on me so I mean I'm not bad I
like okay as long as I blend it on my
deck it'll be fine
okay so safe I don't feel very
lightweight it doesn't feel heavy it
doesn't feel cakey the foundation brush
is definitely blending it in really
nicely
it looks really seamless it looks really
nice dry and super matte like it's just
dried already and it's matte it's
definitely mat it doesn't feel like
really heavy on the skin it feels nice
and lightweight it doesn't feel like
cakey or anything but yeah it's
definitely definitely it definitely
oxidizes obviously not gonna talk
doesn't everyone it depends on how it
makes me thick in but on me it's
oxidized so just be aware of that maybe
try it on maybe going this door and kind
of like patch test it on your skin first
and then wait for it to dry and see what
color you are cuz um yeah definitely
oxidize it looks really nice it looks
really nice so far I do like the way
that the brush apply is there so I'm
this on my face I'm gonna try it with
the sponge I do prefer sponges like I
said normally just because I feel like I
get more coverage but we'll see cuz a
brush there's a product really nice it's
definitely a full coverage so I'm gonna
use this round side of the sponge and
I'm just gonna press it in this Spanish
was really soft it's really nice and
it's really small which I like
I don't like massive sponges I feel like
it's easier to control when this one
just small
okay I think I prefer the way it's
applied with the sponge I definitely
think you get more coverage than you do
with the brush foundation looks so nice
if you're dry I'll be honest I don't
know if this is gonna work that well for
you because it is Superman I mean II
definitely feel as light as air it
doesn't feel heavy at all so I did pick
up the matchsticks and I just get the
one in French vanilla I I personally
don't really like using these under my
eyes I feel like the crease and
everybody's sticks I just don't feel
like they give us much coverage so I'm
going to try it out anyway mmm I feel
like it's probably gonna look a bit
cakey under my eye so I'm just gonna try
and bend it in this side and see what I
feel and if I'm not really feeling it
I'm poor he's gonna use concealer okay I
feel like it's not blending out the
easiest and also it does look a bit
cakey under my eye but I think that's
the same with me of any of these cream
sticks that I use under my eyes it's the
same if any of them they all do the same
thing to me they always look cakey and
they always just like go right in my
creases so yeah that's like the same
with any see how don't really like the
way it looks under my eye so I'm just
gonna use a normal concealer okay so I
did just wipe off that cream stick
underneath my eye just because it does
look did look cakey on me it just wasn't
really working for me under the eye but
that's the same if any of these cream
sticks they never worked for me under
the eye
they just don't ever look good on me I'm
gonna use this sponge tube in the end I
really like this sponge
I love how small it is and it's just so
easy when they're smaller they're just
so much easier to use and get right in
there under the eye I like how it's got
the flat bit this side and it's got that
flat bit there so you can get right
under your eye like right in there
I really like that okay so I have just
gone and set my under eye and set the
concealer I'm gonna take these other two
matchsticks I picked up so I picked up
the shade makar and the shade tropical
and for contouring so I'm gonna fair
we used to shake Makar there was a cool
town shave walk onto him but it was
going to be way too gray on me so I
picked up this shade maka and I'm just
gonna apply this to contour just
underneath my cheekbone on my jawline
and on my forehead I'm going to take
this foundation brush which still has a
bit of foundation on it and I'm just
gonna press it in and see what happens
see how it blends I picked up the shade
truffle in case I want you to kind of
deepen up this part of the concert which
I like to do sometimes okay so I'm just
pressing it in with this brush and just
blend it in really easily actually like
really easy it's blended in really well
and it kind of dries a bit sort of semi
matte it doesn't dry it's not like super
creamy and like you thought you have to
set it it almost kind of like sets
itself kind of like the foundation I
feel like with this kind of consistency
of the product it's best to kind of just
push it in I feel like if you rub it
you're going to just disturb the product
underneath so yeah it's best for you
just to press it in this brush works
really well to kind of blend in the
contour right if you just press over the
top
the tiny bit of foundation and the brush
to blend out really easy but you have to
move quickly with these products because
they dry down no dry matte and you have
to work quickly of them always you won't
be able to blend in the product it'll be
hard to blend it in so you kind of have
to work quite quickly with these but I
find but I am really impressed so far my
skin looks really nice the foundation
looks really nice and these are blending
really well so I'm really happy so far
so what I'm gonna do next is I'm going
to use the invisi matte blotting powder
and I'm just gonna apply this where I
feel like I need to say
little bit so kind of like in my t-zone
I'm just gonna press it in and I'm using
my Sigma powder blush brush which is the
F and my t-zone like I said I don't feel
like I need to kind of set the
foundation because the foundation sets
itself but I'm going to kind of just
apply some here is where my pores I just
try and minimize them a little bit more
I'm just gonna under as well okay so
there is a brush that you can get with
this M blotting powder but I just
decided to just use my my own brush
don't feel like I need it to buy it but
it's blotting powder feels so nice
I feel like it's a really good one it's
a handy ones are having your handbag
when you're on the go and you can you
get a bit well you can just quickly dust
a brush in there and just brought the
powder where you a bit oily enough like
it's really really good for that purpose
so what I feel like I want to do is I
want to take the kilowatt freestyle
highlight and they show trophy wife and
I want to apply this to my lids so I'm
excited because I've seen everyone I've
seen this going on Twitter and I've
watched a couple people review couple of
people's reviews and this is so
pigmented by the looks of things so I'm
excited so I'm gonna weigh this in my
lids and I'm also gonna wear this it's
actually highlight as well so we're
gonna see what I think so what i'm gonna
do is i'm going to take my sigma f 70
brush and i'm just dipping my brush in
here i'm gonna apply this to the lids oh
my god oh they weren't lying
oh my god
 wow that looks so nice on the eye
lid
I can't that looks so nice but I didn't
even put my brush in it like hardly at
all oh my god this is quite a bit
area highlight but I'm not mad at it
honestly on the run it I'm gonna see
where looks like on the actual skin but
on the eyelid
it looks so bomb oh my god
I'm sure okay so just suck some lashes
on off-camera and now we are gonna
highlight which I'm so excited about and
I think she I can't even I can't even
wait for this I'm so excited so I've got
that one which is in the shade trophy
wife and then I also picked up this one
which is the kilowatt freestyle
highlight duo this is in the shade mean
money and hustler baby so I'm gonna use
the shade hustler baby which is like
looks like this I'm just watched on my
hand for you and I'm gonna mix it with
the shade trophy wife because trophy
wife is quite glittery where I applied
it my lids it's kind of transferred onto
my face it's kind of like I've got a bit
of fallout so I want to be really
careful when I use this on my face cuz I
don't want my whole face to end up in
glitter so I'm gonna just use the shade
how's the baby first and then I'm gonna
apply some of that one on top so I have
got the highlight brush and I just love
how I love the shape of the brush I
think is so cool
I don't like hugs the cheek almost I
really love the design of the brush I
think it's so unique so I'm gonna spray
the brush weight a little bit
we don't even need to do this I think
it's gonna be so intense so I'm first of
all gonna go for the shade hustler baby
have to let baek-mae and I'm gonna I'm
gonna kind of press it in rather than
Rob I'll get scared oh that's nice I
like that I'm gonna kind of bring it
around the eyebrow whoa this is nice if
you feel like the shade trophy wife is
gonna be too yellow for you if you just
want more of that kind of like rosy gold
kind of shade then definitely go for
this one okay I'm just scared for this
I'm scared I'm really scared of saying
how intense this is once again so I'm
definitely gonna press this one in
because this is glittery and I don't
need to end up all over my face
okay hey so far so good just press it in
this one is so bright oh my god I love
it so I'm gonna take this red house with
a baby and I'm going to apply this to
the inner corner of my eye and also my
brow bone
also if you don't like literary
highlights the shade hostile maybe the
ones I'm using a minute is not glittery
at all
so go for this one okay so I'm gonna
spray my face again and now we're gonna
move on to lips so I did pick up the lip
gloss so this is the lip gloss is called
fenty glow and a little description is
it says addictive shine nourishing we're
universal finishing touch so I'm so
excited to try this I'm just gonna line
my lips real quick okay so just line my
lips really quickly and I kind of want
to pile a little bit of this trophy wife
on the minim wheeler just to be extras
 so I'm just pressing a little bit
of that highlight shade in the middle
mine there before but the gloss on
although the gloss smells mmm cosmos so
good it feels nice isn't full sticky
which is nice I hate sticky got is okay
at that highlight show just went so I'm
gonna reapply that to my lips laughs it

obsessed with this highlight I cannot
get enough like I'm obsessed and I love
the way looks on the lids as well also
in the center of the lid I love the
foundation I love the contour sticks I
love everything okay the only thing I'm
not a fan of was the match stick to
conceal like wanted to brighten up my
under-eye and stuff I just don't it's
not even just that product just like any
