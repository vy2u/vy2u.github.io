channel if you're new here that hello
welcome to my channel my name is Holly
Boone so today I'm gonna be doing a
video on my new favorite drugstore
foundation and I'm going to show you how
I apply it I've been using it over the
past week and I've been testing out a
lot of drugstore foundations and this
one by far is my absolute favorite I'm
going to share it with you all get my
health for my face cuz we don't be
getting furnished in my hair no thanks
so I'm going to put on my skin and I'm
gonna use the stay with a primer from
prime what I actually really like this
extends the wear makeup and I really
feel like it does smooth out my skin and
stuff so I've got moisturizer but it's a
little bit tacky so it really keeps the
foundation on the only problem I find of
it is I don't really like the smell of
it I see anything but apart from that
you can't smell it when you put the
foundation on top anyway so does really
matter but yeah just the smell isn't
great okay so the foundation that I have
been obsessing over is this Maybelline
24 hour super stay full coverage
foundation I've been mixing the shades
601 with 600 because I can't find my
shade in store
I think they've made me have more shades
online I'm not sure but yeah this is a
foundation that I've been obsessed and I
like I said I've been trying out a lot
of drugstore foundations over this week
and trying to find one that I think is
really really good and this is the one
I'm going to show you I'm really excited
I like to mix more of the shade 601 and
then a little bit of the shade 600 and
then I'm just going to mix it on the
back of my hand I'm just gonna top this
around my face but yeah this foundation
definitely stays in place all day I did
get a little bit oily throughout the day
but that's just I find that was just
like every single foundation I ever try
as I always get is highly a bit oily in
regards to this staying on 24 hours I
mean who even keeps their foundation on
that long so I mean I didn't test it
with 24 hours but I had it on frigates
6-7 hours so I'm gonna take my Beauty
Blender rendus in it's definitely a full
coverage I feel like a little bit goes a
long way I always end up fitting way too
much on right this is probably way too
much but I always overdo it always I've
got this foundation with my Superdrug
and it was $9.99 you get how many miles
approached again her you get that email
foundation
which is pretty much normal but as you
can see it's a nice full coverage it
burns up very nicely it doesn't really
have a cent and we really say it's got a
cent to it which is good so read it like
cents in products I'm just I don't know
why I'm just not really a and necess I
can lip product then I'm all for it you
guys know I had Sid been my friend
foundation because it's breaking me out
and I love doing it like a lot to finish
of it I love to open about that
foundation but the only thing was it
kept breaking me out so I had to been it
I was like I'm gonna pin it because I
wasn't gonna keep using it in the hunt
to find a good affordable foundation and
I saw this one and I was like super stay
cool cuff rate that's a bit of me I
would say it's not like a fourth fully
mattes it's kind I could semi matte
finish and as you can see you still do
get like a bit nice bit of glow with it
as well which is nice I definitely think
it applies better with the sponge I
tried it with a brush the other day it's
definitely a price that are with a
sponge I'm then going to conceal I'm
going to use my concealer to find full
coverage concealer from makeup
revolution shade c5 I haven't touched
any other concealer since I discovered
this no joke like I'm obsessed even like
some days when I don't want to wear
those makeup I just put like two little
dots of it and then blend it in with my
finger and it just covers so well I'm
gonna use the famous bun to blend it in
this concealer blends in really nicely
with this foundation as well I haven't
found a foundation this doesn't blend in
as I told you guys I've been trying a
few foundations and this concealer works
with pretty much every single foundation
which is good because sometimes I find
certain concealers work well with
certain foundations but this one works
with everything that I've tried yeah as
you can see the concealers been didn't
renounce the foundation the foundation
is bomb honestly I'm obsessed it's
definitely my new favorite you're
putting anything in every single video
now home with the concealer because I
get stuck in my ways and I just always
want to just stick to products just
gonna finish off my face with the
foundation so you can see how it works
when I put powder on top how it looks
when I put bronzers on and stuff it
looks really good gonna show you is I'm
gonna take my make it revolution
concealer in the shade c14 to contour
I'm just gonna put a few dots
I was like I'm just gonna put a few dots
and then start drawing lines what and
then I'm gonna take my sponge which has
the foundation on the bottom to blend
this in
I'm still trying out a few more
foundations because I want to give more
options in case you don't want a full
coverage or in case you want more better
a sheer foundation that the cream
contour is all blended in as you can see
looks really awesome so for the
foundation hasn't disturb the foundation
underneath which is good and so now I'm
going to set the face I'm gonna use my
Beauty bakery translucent powder this is
actually my favorite powder ever so I'm
gonna take a separate sponge I always
have one for cream one for powder you
don't want to mix the two up because
then it can make your face look a bit
cakey if you use your powder and then
you go with cream it's just mess so as
you guys know I use this mac studio fix
powder for the rest of my face and and I
use it in the shade NC 43 and I love
this this is like everything I use it
all the time anyway I found this one in
Primark which is the perfect color
powder in the shade toffee it was 2
pounds and mattifying powder and the
shade is so similar I'd say this one is
a little tiny tiny tiny tiny bit warmer
than this one but what the I know
what the utter fog I'm going to use my
primer powder with my big fluffy brush
with it cause my eggs and I'm going to
just set the rest of my face but yeah
the undertone is slightly different like
this hi smell and once it's applied to
the skin you can't really tell anyway so
I did just finish my eye makeup and did
my lips off-camera this foundation is
definitely my favorite at the moment
from the drugstore I love a full
coverage foundation this is definitely
full coverage it's not completely a
matte finish
it's got like so a matte finish where
it's like a little bit juhi which is
really nice if you are oily like me
you kind of set your prime underneath
this I mean I have actually tried that
yeah I should probably try that and but
if not just carry a powder with round
review if you're going out somewhere and
just take like a powder and your bag and
a brush and just
touch up when you get shiny throughout
the day definitely just last it's just I
get like shiny on my forehead and my
chin and stuff if you have dry skin and
you're looking for a really nice full
coverage foundation definitely
definitely definitely recommend this
someone told me that they do have more
shades online by the way what a surprise
I've lost a lid I lose the news but
everything if you don't already know for
new hair you don't know this I'll lose
lists everything so I mean probably I
saw my film next video that lid will be
gone as well um be apparently there are
more shades online in store there was it
she like six shades and I was like so I
had to get two to mix but I'm definitely
looking online and see if they have more
shades because it would be easy if there
was just one I hate having to keep
mixing shades sometimes really also this
powder from prime eye which is two pound
which is so much like my mac studio fix
powder and the textures the same
everything about the powder is exactly
the same apart from this one is a
slightest bit more yellow like the
tiniest tiniest tiniest amount it's not
even that noticeable when you put on the
skin and and this one is like thirty
quid a thing and this one's two pounds
so if you're looking for a good all-over
face powder this one from Primark I've
been using recently is so good see how
just wait Shay's foundation I've fallen
in love with from the drugstore and like
say it's nine pounds you get the amount
of product and there should be more
shades online that's why I've been told
I'm not sure I'm gonna double-check that
everything will be linked in the
description box below I hope you guys
