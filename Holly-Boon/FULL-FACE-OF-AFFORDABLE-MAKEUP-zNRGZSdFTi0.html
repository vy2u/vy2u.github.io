channel and hello hi if you are new here
my name is Holly Boone so in today's
video I'm going to do a full face of
affordable makeup it's the stuff that
you can find in a super drug and boots
and all that kind of stuff
some of this stuff I have used before
and then some of it is new new stuff so
it's going to be a mixture of like first
impressions and stuff I've already tried
just quick I tried to go for a messy
ponytail today and it looks like I've
just got out of bed like it won't go how
I want to though it's so annoying
so the first thing I'm going to do is I
browse for my eyebrows the support that
I always use it's my ride-or-die it's
something I absolutely love it's the NYX
micro brow pencil in the shade black I
talk about this in every single video
it's honestly the only brow product that
I use it's really really affordable and
yeah I just love it when I get a new one
this is a new one I run off it's so
quick I literally get through this
promise alright so fast I'm so I've just
started a new one when I got a new one I
kind of just draw on the back of my hand
a little bit first because it's a little
bit stiff at first like the end is quite
sharp so I like to just see that for us
so I'm gonna start by lightly
underlining my brow just follow me in
the natural shape and then what I like
to do is do the same on the top brown
I'm gonna give myself a little bit more
of an arch because I just prefer it so I
need over line in this my artist is here
and then once I've done that I'm just
gonna go through the brow and lightly
starts to fill it in I don't want to
apply too much pressure but I don't want
my brows stick to drawing on
so I'm when you're applying a little bit
of pressure and I'm just doing a little
strokes throughout the brow okay then
the start of the brow I'm just gonna
lightly go through
again doing little strokes but really
really really lightly okay so I just did
my other eyebrow so next I'm gonna do
more eyeshadow base I'm going to use my
P louise base it's my absolute favorite
this isn't actually in the drugstore but
it is an affordable product and I think
it's back in stock on her website I'm
not sure it's just amazing and session
my favorites so I'm gonna carve out my
brows of this
then I'm just going to apply this all
over the eye I'm just going to press it
on this is what Paige does you follow
Peter his makeup Academy this is how she
applies the base I like it because you
get so much coverage and you better
pressed in rather than rubbing because
you don't want brush brush stroke marks
and so I'm going to use my makeup
revolution Pro HD amplifier 35 palette
this is the end of innovation palette
I've used this before and I really liked
it so I want you to use this get whoa
so what it is again I'm not actually
tries it with this eyeshadow base so I
think it making so much your friend okay
so I'm going to go in with this color
right here on my so we've got two three
four looks mocha luck smokey shader
brush and I'm going to just press this
on just above my crease and in the
crease
don't really know what kind of look I
want to do so I'm just gonna wing it to
be honest just gonna say weapons
okay now I've laid down that color I
don't even know if I like anyway I'm
gonna go with this color right here and
a fluffy brush actually not that brush
I'm gonna take this brush instead I'm
just gonna buff the edge this brush is
so soft like I should have just makes me
wanna fall asleep
there's like an iron massage see I'm
just gonna keep going backwards and
forwards until it's blended together and
diffused which takes a while my arm was
gonna egg spot wasn't even very big and
then I picked it what why why why did I
do that
the reason why I lay the crease card on
first and then grow transition is
because I'm not setting my base so I
find it easier to pack the corner and
then diffuse it if I go in straight away
with the transition color I feel like it
moves the base the eyeshadow base you
used to be on the line on my take all
the time yeah yeah oh my gosh yeah this
is a really really good palette by the
way you get a lot of shades in here it's
so affordable and the shades are really
really good makes I'm gonna go with this
color right here which is like a orange
like a peachy orange color
and I'm using this brush from Anasazi
Beverly Hills that you get with the
palette I'm just gonna press this on I'm
going to the lid kind of what like a
peachy kind of vibe see I'm just
pressing this all over the lid using
this brush from Anasazi Beverly Hills
and then I'm gonna go back to this brush
and I'm gonna Bend the crease okay so
now I'm going to do line up I'm gonna
use my NYX vinyl liquid liner in the
shade black just gonna line my lashline
this it's a really thin liner this is
something that I've used before us why
this line I really like it line in the
dash line it's really good for a winged
liner as well as very black I said you
won't been watching glam masters I'm
using my I asked in drama Joe liner from
Maybelline by the way I'm going to use
this for my upper waterline m/v I've
been watching gum loss is almost says I
love it so much
one like episode the one just before the
fight so he final a few people are
message immediate have you even watched
NYX it's not available in the UK but I
found a website I don't tell you what
I'm probably gonna get eyes a
below I shouldn't be watching it on this
website but they think this website is a
website ly you should be watching things
on but yeah some of our announced where
everyone so now we've pretty much
finished the eye makeup when is it just
seemed you out a little bit for the face
I'm gonna just apply some glue to my
last year's these are the croco lashes
are more and I'm gonna put some glue and
just let them dry down for a minute you
can't get these in like super dropper
boots which is in a meeting but they are
affordable you get a lot of wears out of
them and they're about I think I write
11 powers which seems like a lot for a
pair blushes but they do like you can
reuse them like so many times okay so
for my prime I'll I picked up this
Maybelline new baby skin instant pore
eraser I've seen so many people use this
like for so long and I've never tried it
so I was really interested it says that
you can apply it alone or under makeup
and it's a lightweight primer smooth
poreless looking skin so so I'm just
gonna apply this in the center of my
face I'm not gonna try this all over
there's a L'Oreal one that's like this I
think what it's called it's parasol
definitely smooths the silicon-silicon
II primers will definitely freeing your
pores and every smooth out your skin but
they always to me just feel a bit greasy
I'm not a huge fan of them but they do
the job so it's really annoying
you want to use it or you don't okay so
if your foundation my favorite drugstore
foundation at the moment maybe in 24
hours day and wearing this constantly I
mix the shade 40 which is fawn with a
little bit of 51 which is caramel beige
I just can't seem to find my exact shade
in this so I'm gonna mix these two
together so I'm going to do more of the
shade fawn and then a little bit of the
shade caramel beige so 48 and 51 so I'm
just mixing it on the back of my hand
and I'm just gonna dot this around my
face yeah absolutely love this
foundation so good such a full coverage
it just lasts really well on my skin I
like the finish because it is a very
matte finish and I get really so I like
that this keeps me oh you're free and
I'm going to spend this in with this
bunch this foundation works really well
with a sponge or a brush I use a brush
the other day and it looked really
really good with that as well so it was
one of those foundations that you can
apply with a brush or a sponge and I
normally wear with this foundation there
was over hours primer and that primer I
let you swear by yeah I don't normally
feel like primer does a lot for me in
regards to keeping my makeup on but that
primer definitely does accuse me oil
free for so long I wear this foundation
with any other primer or on it's like
with moisturizer underneath it will all
start to get really after about five
hours six hours if I use that all hours
primer from YSL I don't even get oily
after eight hours and I'm like what the
 it's so good I'm just a person I
don't mind spending money on a product
if I know that it's a hundred percent
gonna work and it's gonna you know be
like absolutely worth there I don't mind
at all it's when you spend money on
these products and you can get the same
thing from the drugstore
that's when it's like aw for fuck's sake
do you know I mean so I have two
concealers from the drugstore they
absolutely love one is the
revolution concerning defined in the
shade c5 because when I absolutely loved
that
and it also loved the main being the
eraser I perfect some cover concealer I
use the shade nude so I think I'm gonna
do like a mixture of both I'm gonna do a
little bit of this shade nude and then a
little bit of the maker of region one on
top cause the makeup revolution ones a
bit lighter I love that the sponge on
the end because you do get more coverage
when you use a sponge but after a while
it gets a bit like come on and come out
come on I'm just going to try and going
to nuke my eye this is the topical color
concealer that I like when I don't want
to really brought under eye I just it
you want to conceal my dark circles I'm
also bringing it up down the sides of my
nose as well and in the middle of my
forehead little bit on my chin don't
worry I'm fully aware about my lashes
I'm just leaving them for a little bit
longer so I'm going to use some of my
makeup revolution concealer define in
this 85 I'm gonna add a little bit of
this on top just to brighten it a little
bit then I'm gonna use my sponge you've
heard it was screaming at me think about
your eyelashes yes
don't worry hum for God I haven't
forgotten I like to leave them for a
while because I always think the blue is
dry and it's like not always like
panicking oh my god but I like it when
it's literally almost dry and they just
stick on so much easier especially when
there are new lash as well when there
are new lash there's so much harness to
stick on then when you've actually worn
them a couple of times
wow those thick concealers together are
really nice so I always find it when I
use just the concealer define from them
and make a revolution I love it but when
I have got a bit more like dark circles
it doesn't do the best job of covering
it completely I feel like I have to use
a color corrector underneath but I think
these two together I've worked really
well okay I'm going to set my under eye
in the Gnostic mashes on so I picked up
the makeup revolution luxury powder
in the shade banana I went up and out of
powder anyway because sometimes I feel
like translucent can look at the ashy
under my eyes especially when I'm eating
like a warm warm concealer so I
definitely wanted to try a new banana
powder I did we like the one from
Primark I do still really like that so
wonder if this is like quite similar
apply some of this powder I'm gonna use
the same sponge okay it has made my
under eye a little bit darker because
obviously it's a banana palace it's like
you know color but I like it if you are
quite sound and you use like a warmish
concealer a very yellow concealer I
would definitely try put on a powder
even like a translation because
sometimes I mean translation is good
because it can kind of give you a little
bit more brightness but then it can
sometimes make you look a little bit
gray little bit under the eyes so
definitely recommend trying to put on a
powder it does make a lot of difference
yeah I think that looks really good I'm
really happy with this so far so I
picked up this mascara this is the
Maybelline total temptation the brush
look like the kind of brush I like on a
mascara that's why things out but I've
never actually tried this before one
thing I hate is this type of packet in
but it's got this like plastic seal
around and it's just so impossible to
get it off I understand their needs to
do this but I'd like it it's annoying
should I one thing I really hate and
this tends to happen is super drug raids
quite often and Primark he who sticks
their fingers in styling open products
like they just like you going to pick up
a mascara somebody's opened it it's so
unwitting it just ones me out I'm
thinking how are you stood in the shop
money seems to get this compact enough
about somebody notice it I'm so confused
okay so I'm gonna apply a little bit of
this mascara when Tosh's it's so hard
for me to judge mascara is because I
always wear false lashes and my top
lashes are just like crap but I'm gonna
see what this is like on my bottom
lashes
now I'm gonna stick these eyelashes on
before they completely dry do you see
how much easier that is to stick your
eyelash on when you leave it to
literally dry all the way down you can
just lightly literally place it on and
it was dark
something bright oh my god why do you
brush this for so long I'm like because
it's just so much easier when you go to
apply them see how easy that was
yes I'm gonna finish off my eye shadow
under my eyes and I'm gonna go back to
this Pro HD palette I'm gonna go for
this color it's gonna go I'm gonna zip
it up orange which I used all over the
lid and I'm gonna apply that underneath
the eye as well and I'm gonna go back to
this brush thanks I'm gonna use my NYX
pure white slide on I own is a slide on
glide on stay on and definitely a
turn-on
waterproof waterproof extreme shine
eyeliner okay it's in my bottom
waterline I just felt like the look need
to be brightened up a little bit if you
really want to open up your eye and you
don't want to put a white because white
is just too much I would recommend
getting the Mac Studio chroma graphic
pencils I have to show at NC 15
and this is perfect I put this on my
waterline when I want my eyes to look
like a bit brighter I've been what open
but I don't want to white I don't want a
white because white sometimes a little
bit too much and see I get I get this
pencil in NC 15 and it's so good okay so
we try this mascara off the bottom
lashes and see what I think don't if
it's gonna be a little bit too big of a
brush there is still a really long
bottom lashes I don't know what happened
what the hell happened there not as long
as
today they used to be so long when I put
mascara on they would let you touch my
skin it was so hard to put my scar about
getting it on why I'm dry now they're
sure and I'm just like what okay so for
bronze I picked up this collection
bronze glow matte bronzer so looking for
this a go I'm gonna apply this using a
fluffy brush you see what it looks like
okay so it's applying very nice and
evenly
I'm not tried this bronzer before I
don't think I'm pretty sure I haven't
tried nice and even it's quite a nice
color it's not too like orange it's not
too bad I like this bonds that ones is
really nice also I do be like they're
loose highlight they do it's really nice
it's a little bit messy but I do really
like it okay the bronzer was a pass for
me I like it
next thing I got this L'Oreal life's a
peach blush I love a peachy blush and in
this words gold packaging it was just
like staring at me on the on the car
this is staring at me on the Daurio
counter and I was like do I need it
do I do I really need it yesterday oh my
god
this smells so good oh my god this
smells so so good
it's obviously peach because it's a
peach blush but if you love the smell of
peaches you love this it smells
unbelievable
and then you fit this bit up here and
you've got this brush I personally don't
like these proteins I feel like he
doesn't apply the product very evenly so
I'm not going to use the brush but
you've also got a mirror as well come to
the mirror that's really cute so I'm
going to apply this with my NYX fluffy
brush I can't go over how good that
smells and we're applying it to the
apples of my cheeks and then I'm gonna
bring it back here as well so a lot of
fun that looks as well I love a peachy
blush and I think it goes really good
I look so when I was in soup drag I
picked up the South Times makeup
revolution highlight palette much right
this year and everyone says how amazing
it is and I think such was so cute I
love her I met her when we did a l'oreal
she took about eight years ago and she's
so sweet
I love the YouTube channel so I really
wanted to support Sophie and get her
palette okay so this is what the palette
looks like so I'm gonna go with that
shade I've just put some in the back of
my hand it looks so pigmented and I'm
gonna apply it using my morphe M 501
brush so let's see Wow wow that's so
nice
oh my god I love that Wow I only had to
put a little bit on and look how good
that is
yes so I love this
so I'm going to use this lighter color
and wait in a corner nice very very very
nice highlight for it and it's so
affordable as well as well okay so for
lips I've got this Rimmel lip liner in
the shade blushing nude which is this
color which I thought it was really
really nice and then I picked up these
velvet lip lacquers from MUA so these
are guys I couldn't really see what the
color was supposed to be this is in the
shade tranquility see what's this on the
back of my hand
that's that color tranquility that's
really nice and low so all this color as
well which is harmony which i think is
actually a lighter color that one there
is called harmony I've also got a new
one of my favourite glass which is the
NYX butter gloss in the shade Madeline
if you follow me for a while you know I
literally love this glass it's like one
of my absolute favorites
ever
like a violation my favorite and so I'm
gonna line my lips with this room or lip
liner first then I'm going to apply some
of this velvet lip black are from MUA in
the shade harmony smell like actually
normally I find when I buy like glowy
and liquid lipsticks they kind of have
like a funny smell this one actually
smells really nice it really like that
color it's really really pretty and then
would it be a me video if we didn't do a
glass no it wouldn't so we're gonna do a
lip gloss my favorite lip gloss ever
which is the NYX butter gloss in the
shape Madeline is on top my favorite lip
gloss ever
I love the bottle gloss because the
daylight gloss is that a really really
pigmented I just like my glasses to have
like a little bit of her eye color to
them I don't want them to be like really
pigmented like the Mark Davis glosses
are not far off because they're just
like pure pigment and I just I just
don't like it I like this like a tin so
next I picked up the revolution Pro fix
or your control fixing spray never tried
this so this is the first I always get
scared with sprays because they can like
they might ruin your makeup
you never know it's so annoying okay it
smells like hospitals I don't know how
to expect it smells like the hospital
like you know your sauce button has that
smell he smells like that is so weird
that's so strange why does it smell
smells like abused yeah I don't know I
don't this one of that but it does feel
a little bit sticky when it goes on the
skin so I feel like it is definitely set
in it felt like it looked like it was a
bit sticky so that is the finished look
I hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial
there isn't really anything that I
didn't like I like this says some of
this stuff I've used many many many
times and I know that I already loved
them but the new stuff that I tried I
loved everything the only thing I don't
really like is the smell of the fixing
spray from makeup revolution this well
just makes me smile Hospital I don't
know I don't know why me the sellers and
so I'm not a huge fan of the smell but I
definitely feel like when I sprayed it
it kind of felt like it it was a little
bit sticky like it's stuck wear makeup
so yeah I'm happy with that I'm having
the defeat of it I feel like it
definitely did something but I just like
the smell everything else I absolutely
love I'm really really impressed with
this highlight point from sort of soaps
collab I absolutely love it I can't move
it's taken me this long to try it um but
yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this video
