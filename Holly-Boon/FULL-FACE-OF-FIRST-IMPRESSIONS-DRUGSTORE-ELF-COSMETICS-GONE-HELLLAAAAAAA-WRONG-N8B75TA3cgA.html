a full face of elf because my ex it
recently came back to Superdrug I don't
know I think they used to be a super
driver at home back and I've never
actually easy to process well I'm
excited because they look good so and
the drug star so excited so a whole box
here which I would for a super and then
serious I think I've ordered all the
wrong shades like is so hard to pick
your shade online
I honestly and even I want to zoom in it
like so bear with me we will try and
feel great
it will happen yeah I just always like
to play online and stuff but the
packaging looks really good i from
reading part of the packages and looks
very good so I'm excited first we're
going to take this which is the lot on
liner and brow cream in the shade medium
brown it's a loose like this I've
definitely got the wrong shade like I
said I've got the wrong turn pretty much
I said so yeah you can see there's ways
you're picking for me and also if the
foundation is very dark so we'll see why
was anyway so when you use this route
for me oh it's pretty creamy when you
use my wind on a brush by zoeva okay
okay I don't think I did get the wrong
shade because medium brown base actually
does look lighter in the pot but it's a
lot darker when you put it on and it's a
really nice cool tone color it's not
really warm so yesterday I never find
drugstore I rock roads that aren't
already warm and this was not so loving
this I'm really impressed this profile
I'm really impressed of it it's a really
good shade is that the perfect shade
it's really creamy it extremely I'm
really impressed
I'm really really impressed with this
product I want to see okay strokes
or just never comes through for me so I
love this it's called the lock on liner
and broke room I think I actually like
this better than the benefit of our we
do benefit benefit to brow it's not as
creamy how to use this is very creamy
to just glide through the brow you know
sorry benefit but oh cause my ex will
come to through so then I picked up
this perfect boom concealer this is in
the shade light beige which i think is
probably a little bit too pinky for me
but you can make it work you can make it
work so I'm going to just apply some of
this to my lids
this is way too pink you for me please
I'm going to take my the single flat
definer brush just to comb out the brow
yeah with this cuz you is very worried
it's not it's pretty much no coverage I
bought is cream cons apart so I'm going
to just try to pronounce a to the light
shade in here you can see though this
has got no coverage if the resonators
cream cones okay terrific light shade
here and I'm going to use this to carve
out my brows and then I'm just gonna
apply it all over the lid for my base so
I'm gonna take this HD under eye setting
powder I don't need just to set my lid
so many is my Sigma round precision
brush to put this powder online in I can
see that it has no coverage I think any
loads of azita's that I think I just
picked up the wrong one so they've got
this eyeshadow palette this is the nude
rose gold I sort of had out so straight
out it's nice
this is way too excited these are the
shades looks really nice up today I'm
going to take my diffused crease brush
by Sigma F this is it zero here I mean
the iPhone is are okay now trying to the
lid okay I just have a lot of thoughtful
that when you try to pick up the product
in a brush I really struggle drugstore
Ashley's because Y is very sensitive and
they're wasting my eyes for some reason
three words I don't know why I think
they're made with something different
and we grew this darker shade right here
I'm the same brush I'm gonna use this in
the crease I mean they're blended out
okay another word by shadows the
pigments really good this is quite
four wheel out we rise in my later
family go for this shade right here
which is like like a shimmer yeah it's
like a shimmer shadow when you use that
I'm just going to put this on the lid
okay okay
of course max I think you got bad you do
this you might give the nature palette a
little bit of shimmer on the lid there's
loads of fall out there with that the
shimmers with this one anyway loads
fold up the way you've got to do your
eye makeup first
hope you haven't ruled out everywhere
all over your face like a foundation how
no so I want to do a winged liner design
of a winged liner so I've got the elf
cream eyeliner in the shade black I'm
going to give this a go we're trying to
win well I know I started to find line
as it don't transfer using my ts6 winged
liner brush from sigma penny brought
over use for line are just we're so good
now we'll create a blacklist eyeliner
and it's drying quite gray and then it
comes out quite better than its drying
quite like grey I forgot some layer in
it it's getting darker which is good
okay so I just did the other wing of
camera and the more yar is darker it
gets I can have a chip on really black
now and also I don't have any trans via
its ride really quickly and I feel like
on this eye I took some other port and
put it on the back of my head and then
use the off the back of my hand and it
just works a lot better it is a lot more
creamier and so next thing I've got with
you samskara primer and it is
transparent I'm never trying to mascara
for ever before so remembering my love I
use the mascara primer I'm doing in
which diversity
who says prep blushes to accentuate
length and volume helps lashes appear
thicker longer and stronger
you may notice pull ways facing a new
mascara I'm not okay so it said you've
got to let that dry completely before
you apply mascara on the top so I did
get the volume plumping mascara in black
as well so middle aces to dry and then
when I apply this on top it's hard for
me to tell with my eyes a bit longer
because I've worked it on my wound liner
so it's hard for me to see if it's
actually done in his head also my
eyelash is a very short so okay so just
dr. Rush's on off camera because these
arms aren't from the brand these are
just part of our clinics and I need
recent lashes because my lashes are
non-existent so right so we're going to
start on the face I've got this
hydrating face primer really fast right
it looks very good
so actually looks nice anything I'm not
a huge fan of is the concealer I think
it's because I picked up the wrong one
it's very Schleich sheer it's not very
it's not as lutely no coverage of it so
that's the only thing I don't like is it
written as ei which is hydrating face
primer
okay definitely put hydrating
that's hydrated my oven today what about
this one his nice because a little bit
poorly to me politically for me so I
picked up this foundation which is the
oil-free sunscreen for florist finish
foundation in the shade bath I actually
went off the shade from China grimmons
to try and remember this video and she
used the shade so I kind of went off
that because I feel like she's quite and
I was quite half a pound
see I'm going to use my 3d bender from
Sigma supply this is nice
I know it's my Beauty burger so
everybody was bit very full coverage so
happy about it I'm not sure we'll wait
for that I'm finna see how it goes we
should have a slightly warmer shade
obviously I only have this concealer
which is obviously not going to do
anything for me saying I don't want to
use that and I'm just going to use this
cream contour palette and I'm just going
to take that light light shade use that
just to highlight my under eye and go
this way but this is so yellow holy
and we're going to bring some done the
bridge of my nose and over on the end
live them with forehead and my chin
although this is not gonna work oh no
looks so great it's a grey a
they're going so well this is my fault
for getting the wrong concealer in the
wrong shade so my under eyes bright spot
oh I was going to say wow it has not
been that very nice at all
it literally looks so bad like
separating it looks cakey
I can it looks gray puckett
I he'll parking Katie I should have got
purple concealer and I feel like it'd be
okay I didn't get the right concealer so
these this and it just looks a
mess
whereas I know I brighten in sitting
 oh my god it just looks a mess I
wore some HD powder a bit the flashback
is going to be a joke on this a live a
little a little poop okay how did you
get into this walk about why we need is
a little goofy thing group just set my
face with this this could
be really bad city but I mean my face
huh got any worse so face makeup looks a
disaster okay honestly I can't even do
anymore
I can't look so bad oh my god dust
yourself
I didn't get up runs up what an idiot
oh my going to six hours mixed so bad so
I'm going to highlight and lips and call
it a day because I've fully packed it so
I bought this highlight this is the elf
egg highlight in the shade moonlight pal
I saw Jacqueline here I showed my
yesterday that scraping the top layer
off and then using the bit underneath
