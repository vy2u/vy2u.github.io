because I've actually never done a full
phase of first impressions before this
is like the first time I've ever done
this so I'm really excited to try like
shit-ton of like new products so yeah
I'm excited so I'm just gonna start
right away I picked up this NYX taemin
frame tinted brow pomade because I do
like a brow pomade and I tried there um
just brought the brow Wiz I tried that
with one I really liked it so I thought
I would try the pomade
so I'm gonna try this today and when you
take my zoeva winged liner brush this is
a three one seven brush I love this for
my eyebrows because it's like really
thin it's really good I did get the
shade black by the way it's a really
nice cool cool shade not water which is
what I love in a brand product they
don't like warm shades because obviously
my hair is really actually so I don't
want like warm eyebrows do you know so I
always start by lying under my eyebrows
and then I will line the top of my brow
to the shape that I want
so far I'm loving this product it's
really creamy easy to use anything bad
to say right now I mean like every other
color of it like I said it's that ashy
color which is nice it's not warm I use
the benefit and Cabrera but it dries out
really quickly and it's like then if I
find it really difficult to use whereas
this I don't know this might dry out
I'll let you guys know but I love this
it's really creamy with the front of my
brow I always just I don't apply any one
product to the brush I'm using leftover
for hours and I'm just underlying that
really lightly and then I just push the
press upwards through my brow just do it
upward stroke so this cuz I don't like
the front of my eyebrows be too harsh I
love this eyebrow product I'm actually
really impressed with this I'm gonna let
you guys know if it dries out
quickly whatever because that's why the
firemen Palmes is they tend to dry out
and they're really hard to use so you
can't get the jewelry line from Inglot
I've heard that's really good to soften
your product well I'm gonna just let you
guys know if this dries out quickly but
I love this I I'm I loved it
so next I've got sent this product and
this is called amazed from amazing
cosmetics amazing concealer and it's
like a little pot like this and it's it
claims to be the world's best concealer
so I mean I don't know about that so I'm
gonna try it
they did send me this little brush as
well which is key so I'm going to use a
little brush to apply it I'm gonna use
this to carve up my eyebrows and so I'm
using the shade medium golden because I
don't want a really bright under-eye or
a really bright lid today because I'm
going from what that soft I want a full
coverage stuff like more of a soft with
daytime look and so yeah I don't want I
really like it no no first quest icky
it's a bit like the becko brightening
corrector it's a bit sticky it's a bit
like that it's nice it's really full
coverage it's full coverage yes I'm just
gonna apply some to my lid don't open my
lid and I'm gonna blend it in with my 3d
blender press it in I'd like to do this
with a 3d render sometimes because it
kind of gets rid of any excess from it
that you don't need if that makes sense
so sometimes I'll put too much concealer
on my lids but then when I kind of press
it in with the blender or kind of remove
any excess product which is good you can
see it is nice I really like it it's a
full coverage I'm going to see what's
like under my eyes because I think
that's the best way to tell can see it
as if they're good as if they crease on
your eyes so the next thing I picked up
was the cover FX matte setting powder
I've never tried this tent powder before
so obviously I want to try it and I have
to covered a new favorite and at first I
was unsure about it but I love it now
it's the Too Faced Born This Way powder
like I can't explain how smooth that
makes your under eyes look and I thought
I had a little bit of flashback bits I
was
whereby and then I realized this next
time around I used it I baked exactly
the same took a picture had no flashback
I think what happened before was I
didn't dust off all the powder properly
so there was obviously a little bit of
powder left so that's where I had that
flashback but um I used it again I
actually loved it but I want to try
another powder for this video so I'm
just gonna take my sponge and I'm gonna
I just sent my the instances powder I
heard good things about her that's why I
saw her and I thought I'm gonna pick it
up and I'm gonna try that again I feel
like with this power I need to see what
it's like on my under eye but it seems
good I'm wet eyes doesn't feel - like -
POW - powdery if that makes sense
feels quite lightweight okay so now I'm
gonna start on my face because I'm not
going to do too much with my eyes today
I'm just gonna do a bit of a soft brown
in the crease some lashes and I pulled
in white in the waterline just cuz I
want to do like a soft daytime look for
the eyes but with her fall be face if
you get me so I picked up two primers
here I didn't know I picked up two but
we're gonna try them so this one's more
expensive
this one's from NYX angel I also heard a
lot of people love this primer I've seen
this bar on YouTube and I'm just I saw a
man that ends and used it and I was like
okay if she uses it then it must be good
it's one in perfecting primer a treat
your skin - this ultra velvety oil-free
prime wife feels lighter than a cloud
and leaves skin looking and feeling
divine so okay that sounds good and then
this one is the Stila one-step primer
and this was a more of an illuminating
serum this says
swear your way to a luminous going
complexion in one step so I think I'm
just gonna use a mixture of the two
maybe this one in my teaser I think the
baculum dis is really cool it looks
really cool okay so oh this is like
Khalid oh my god is that she got up it's
a bit like pinky pink um Brown
okay okay
the light go on highlights the skin the
pale pink warms the complexion and the
kitten brightens and illuminates okay
fair enough
see I'm just gonna approach the outer
part my face but if it's got a little
bit of like shimmer you know there's
your half in about that okay I'm not
sure happy like that being honest it's a
bit weird okay so I'm gonna try ever mix
angel veil and I'm gonna try this in my
t-zone
this really creamy okay this was really
nice this for me okay like that I guess
you dr. soft finished in the skin I like
that that was nice
I'm not sure about the other one not
sure well I steal one it's a bit way the
40-point use that again just looks a bit
weird alright the fact that is coloured
and it also has like little flecks of
like Lucas's shimmery that is really
weird not sure about that one for
foundation this was so hard to find a
foundation I've never tried so I was in
Selfridges and I was like I've tried
NARS I've tried Bobby Brown I've tried
Dior I've tried Mac I've tried
absolutely everything so I was like what
the I stole that Charlotte Tilbury
this magic foundation and it says it's a
full coverage Demi map long lasting
foundation so I mean as soon as I saw
full coverage I was like okay I'm gonna
try this um it says flawless
long-lasting coverage and it's got an
SPF of 15 in it the shade range in this
is poor it's really for I'm not gonna
lie this was a struggle see me try my
shine on my dark so if you have a darker
skin tone then you ain't gonna find a
shade that's the steamer I got the shade
eight which is a medium but it's a
little bit yellow sweet yellow but it
was like the closest I could find to
what I needed so we're gonna give this a
go it says to apply it with a brush but
I thought I could get more coverage if I
use a sponge so I'm gonna try a sponge
and then a fix I feel like it looks
weird and I'll try
it with a brush because I'm just gonna
it's a bit like yellow it's really like
orangey yellow Earth Alliance foundation
it's a weird situation so far it's like
a nice yeah it's definitely a
full-coverage um it feels nice if
there's not so far so color I'm not too
sure about that like a lack of Simpson
right now I don't if it's picking up as
yellow on the camera but it's very
yellow
I look like hurry-mart I do not the
finish of it though it's nice it's
really nice yes to the folk coverage up
in here um okay so I'm gonna take that
amazing concealer in the shade medium
golden okay so I'm gonna applies
concealer under my eyes but I don't need
too much of this cuz it's very full
coverage trying to apply too much but I
do get carried away if so be careful
with for full coverage concealers
because they will crease really easily
if you apply too much product and I mean
I am one of those people that just
always applies way too much what up I
guess I call right away as I'm going to
take my 3d render depressed as you can
see the end okay I do really like the
finish of this concealer I really like
this concealer it's so nice it's such a
full coverage and I love a full coverage
I need to see how this concealer wears
throughout the day and see if it creases
and stuff but at the moment I really
like it okay so just that Friday's I'm
gonna try this amalfi concealer and so
I'm gonna apply somebody's down the
bridge of my nose and then a little bit
on the end of my nose and then I'm gonna
bring a little bit down the sides okay
so I'm gonna take my 3d Brenda I'm gonna
just press this concealer in this is
full coverage this cuz you know I
don't know how this would wear under my
eyes and I am gonna contour my eyes but
I'm going to use a powder too
cons are not cream so I'm just pressing
this in I really like this cuz II like
it's a very full coverage I like it for
the nose it looks good like I said I
don't know about under I've I had a lot
of it was that creases so I'm not sure
but I really like that for the noise I'm
gonna set with this cover FX matte set
and powder in the shade light I'm gonna
take a different sponge I think I want
to bake today I'm gonna bake I'm gonna
just bring this down the sides of my
nose as well
okay this power - feels nice so far I
like it
it feels lightweight like that so far I
like this powder we will see where is he
okay is that I next I picked up this
Stila stay all day bronzer for face and
body in the shade dark cuz you know me I
mean my mac mineralize skinfinish dark
deep is that it's just my life I love
this I picked up dark cuz I like to lick
hands I share this is dark if I darkness
is oh my god okay I feel like a little
bit of this is gonna go along wakes it's
very dark so I'm gonna try and calm my
life with this
I hope it's okay if you just apply a
tiny bit at a time cuz I mean I've got
to shred that up because I feel the fact
I think I am
I like submit sound biatch but this is a
little bit crazy a lot the core of this
though
it's a nice shade it's not it's not it's
it's warm but it's not too warm so that
make sense it's not orange which is good
because I mean normally a range bronzer
but it's a nice color
this runs are okay Ashley I think this
is a cash prize I think it's not this
shade just you don't need much just a
tiny bit I'll actually love for these
products like what the I actually
love in this my eyebrows it's notched my
foundation looks sick
okay see Alex sick and this bronzer I
thought it's gonna be way too dark but
I'm living for
I'm sorry but I think this might have
taken over the Mac Daddy
this is a better shade it's so nice to
shade it's not too warm and I think the
way that powders to me that part is
really smooth that my under eye I
actually really like that this is a good
day cuz I get scared to try new products
like I'm really fussy and I'm obsessed
with these products so far what the
other part I'm just gonna go over my
brows cuz it's empowered are the only
thing I haven't liked so far is this
Stila one-step primer I put in my ears
again you could who's got lays that
glitter in it and I just don't I don't
like that wow I'm impressed with
everything so far I'm impressed okay
okay so I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna
take some of this Stila bronzer on my
Mac to t4 and gonna apply this in the
crease of my eye you just want like a
really subtle I look today so just want
to talk about my crease okay I'm sure
I'm sure these products I further
Foundation fix really nice the
foundations just don't know the
foundation looks so good I was unsure
about the shave but now I've done the
bronzer in the concealer I think the
shades fine okay I'm then gonna apply
some of the bronzer underneath my eye as
well the powered is given a really nice
finish as well it's its main my
under-eye lit really smooth really nice
I love that I'm just gonna apply some
more powder to my I'm gonna bake my
chin because my chin gets so oily so I'm
just gonna bake that for a minute
like some powder as I try and it feels
like really heavy like your skin kind of
goes a little bit its height when you
apply certain power does I don't know if
anybody else ever experiences that but I
feel like it literally makes my face
feel powder it wears this powder they
just use this cover effect it doesn't
feel like that if it was lightweight
which is nice so I got this house of
lashes eyelash curlers in the post from
them so thank you cuz
then we need to get some perso Don
because I read you just that card and
when our shares it would just help blend
my false ones so much better but I just
forget I always forgot to get some go
now try some lashes today I'm gonna
apply some natural ones so these are
these are the iconic light I used to use
the iconic ones all the time
I still love those lashes but I don't
think I've tried iconic light ones
before no I can remember so I'm gonna
give these a go so I picked up this
Maybelline gel liner in the shape in a
brown shade I use this in black and I
love this so much so I picked up in
brown so I already know that I love this
product so sorry this isn't green first
impressions on this but it's a fancy
brushes on the Browns eye we see we
sweep the brown ones like but I kind of
want to just apply some brown since my
last round and kind of smudge it out so
I'm using a little brush that came with
it I'm gonna use this little brush too
hard when you don't have loads of makeup
on a black committee much but then I
feel like I always went along my lash
line because it'll just make my life
sonic voila so I thought every better
just to get a brown when I don't want to
wear like knows that eye makeup okay so
you see how it kind of gives my lash
line a fuller look without being too
dramatic because the blacks not going to
be too much especially like I said
because I've only really up get brown in
my crease so this just looks so much
better either 6 gives you that full lash
line without being too too much too
dramatic
um this is a good day this is a good day
I was scared cuz I paid a lot for most
like some of these products I gotta send
if I spent a lot of money on these
products so I was like I really hope
that they're good coz I was I've wasted
my money and I'm brilliant pressed
because I am loving these so yes it's
night I did forget to get a mascara I
just I don't know I just forgot so I
wear lashes anyways I forgot mascara is
whatever but I'm just gonna apply some
mascara quickly before I apply my fake
lashes
yes I'm just gonna leave the glue to dry
on these lashes for a bit before I apply
them so it'd be a lot easier so the next
thing I picked up was his bourgeois
blush I used to use this brush back in
the day
miles at skies the users aren't
absolutely loved it and I feel like it
will last you so long I used to use my
light every single day and it never used
to get any less like the product will
just say so I feel like this lasts so
long so I really I tried this this is in
the shade 92 it's called sound word and
cuz I'm going to take my fluffy brush
and I'm gonna - is it smells really nice
as well okay I love that that's nice
I love that it's very pigmented as well
it's kind of got a bit of Sheen to it
but it's not glittery that makes sense I
really like that yeah I said I'm a old
school favorite who use this brush since
I was like at school how funny actually
really like I agree I really like that
yay
okay so the lashes are on yeah so what I
want to do I think I want to cut some of
this brown liner in my bottom waterline
and kind of smudge it out a little bit I
don't even want to use black I'm just
gonna kind of bring it just below my
lash line as well
I love these eyelashes I love them so
I'm just gonna apply some mascara to my
bottom lashes I love this um this brown
liner as well next I picked up this
Laura gala illuminator in the shade
gilded honey and up you're going right
why the did you not travel you're
not trying this because everyone care
about this for so many years but I did
try the shade ballerina but I kept
trying to get golden honey bit was never
in stock and then I saw it and I was
like I really want to try that because
I've actually not tried the shade gilded
honey before so I'm really excited to
try this I feel like it'll look really
nice and when skin so it's like a baked
illuminate arm it looks like this see I
use the shade ballerina like ages ago as
well I like literally I can't even
remember my father liked it or not I
can't actually remember so and so this
isn't a first impressions because I
couldn't find this brace oh and what did
you use my Mario Badescu cucumber spray
so I'm going to spray my face and my
brush before I apply the illuminate I'll
just click like and make it look more
luminous just a little bit okay so let's
try this my light okay this is so bright
it's just so nice
Wow no wonder whatever was - about this
same lady I was so late
it was sold out for so long though and
the ballerina Shane was just too pink
and I just sometimes I mixed him a brush
but most of the time it's too pink to
actually use as a couple highlighter so
well I really like this okay I'm going
to stop
down the size of my nose so I'm going to
use my morphe 9c palette again I'm not
tried this before click on the rim so
I'm gonna take this shade right here on
my Sigma angled shading brush let's try
this okay I think it's a good
concentrate I'm just not the best that
contour nose is I'll be honest really
not the rest of it now I'm just going to
take some of this Laura color highlights
and I'm gonna apply that my nose and
then on the tip of my nose
then I'm gonna find some of this in the
corner inner corner of my eye and so for
my lip color I'm going to try the new
melted latex high shine lipstick from
toothpaste this is in the shade hopeless
romantic I'm gonna try this okay this is
like I really pigmented gloss the only
problem I thought I could submit sticky
join me
lovelyz color by the way okay I love the
lip color I love the collar up the gloss
I feel like it's a bit sticky like it's
a sticky gloss and I'm not a huge fan of
sticky grasses but also familiar in
Nicholas it was too sticky so I just
took it off and I'm gonna apply like a
matte matte color instead I'm gonna take
my lip liner from mix in the shade
London this is not first impressions
because I use this lip pencil with a
sign sorry I'm sorry but I just don't
like that
gosh it's - yes he's thick use me and
then lightly on top I'm gonna take the
shade off which is a matte lipstick from
Anasazi Beverly Hills I prayed
I didn't get that in spray like I said I
just couldn't find any that I hadn't
already used so yeah I just bought a big
bottle of the Urban Decay all nighter
setting spray because this is actually
makes my makeup last all day and like I
said I loved this one so much bhai
duration and I just yeah
now this one for hydration and I love
this one for setting my makeup so I'm
gonna use my M decay all nighter this is
a new bottle cuz I did have a little
mini travel sized one but I've got the
big one because I love it so yeah okay
so that is the finished look I have a
shocked at how many of these products I
actually love because it's hard for me
to find products I love so I am sure
like I didn't expect me to love this
foundation like what's a little the
shade nose I don't know I don't know but
I love the finish I love how it looks
with the bronzer with the concealer the
highlight I just loved the way looks on
my skin so as you can see this
foundation looks beautiful that I
actually shot like I am shocked because
when I first put this on and I saw the
shade of it I was like I don't know you
know I was like I don't know about this
foundation but I'm so impressed so
impressive to finish it looks so good I
can see it on the bronzer it finishes
like so bird so I'm so so happy with
that and the only problem is the shade
range it's not great at all like it's a
struggle it's a real struggle but I love
that foundation like what the and
yes I love the bronzer for this is my
new favorite like what the hell goodbye
Mac coming to my skin finish I'm over it
this one is so much nicer because it's
not as warm and it's just like a really
nice bronze ice not too long as your
orange it's so good so I love that as
well and also Laura got a highlighter I
mean where have I been
seriously like I said I did use the
shade ballerina but because it was like
pinky it didn't really pop as much as
this gilded honey but I can't you guys
like I love this like
what the I love that see how I love
everything absolutely everything apart
from the only thing I didn't like is
this I don't like this steel at one step
below minute primer I don't like it it's
got like flecks of glitter in it it
looks shimmery it's I don't really know
I think we got the wait throws in the
skin and I do really like the NYX angel
veil
this feels really nice it really smooth
out the skin it feels really soft first
very nice so I do love that um I love
this old-school blush that I used to use
back in school I love the way it's
almost yeah it looks really nice so I'm
sure I'm really really sure um the cover
FX setting powder I love that as well
I've got the shade light it's really
nice and lightweight it's really smooth
just get out set your makeup and it
doesn't feel it's height and it doesn't
feel heavy so I love the powder I don't
know about the flash back so I will let
you guys know about that I will write a
comment below and I'll let you know what
the flash back is like what's a take
