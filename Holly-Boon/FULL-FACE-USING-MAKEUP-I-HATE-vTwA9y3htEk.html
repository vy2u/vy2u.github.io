I stained my eye that powder I've got me
looking like a ghost of Christmas past
in March me hell no get it off
hey guys welcome back to my youtube
channel and hello hi if you're new here
my name is Holly Boone so in today's
video I'm gonna be using a bunch of
products that I just do not like they do
not work for me I'm not saying that
they're bad products they just don't
work for me and that's just not the type
of thing that I like so yeah that's what
I'm gonna do I have already done what
eyebrows just because I don't actually
have an eyebrow product that I don't
like so yeah let's just get into the
video I'm gonna actually explain to you
guys why I like there and why don't work
for me because I think it's useful
obviously I'm not just gonna be like I
hate it and not say anything but yeah so
I'm gonna start with my skin and for
primer I'm gonna take my all night long
prime art from Barry M the reason why I
hate this is because it's so greasy and
it just feels so uncomfortable like it
does what it says I will say it does
blow the skin and it does give you that
soft focus it definitely just spray your
pores and stuff but it just feels so
uncomfortable on my skin and I just want
to take my makeup off every single time
I have it on I have tried this two or
three times different foundations
different techniques and I just do not
like it just yeah I hate it anybody so
I'm gonna apply it all over I've even
just applied this in my t-zone before
and I just yeah I just really don't like
the way I feel just makes my foundation
feel really uncomfortable
okay the next thing I actually
ate this like that somebody stuff I
dislike and then other things I actually
 hate and this is the Smashbox
Studios again 15 hour we're hydrating
foundation I'm just gonna put this out
there this is not hydrating at all this
actually makes me so dry and makes my
skin feel so dry and horrible
and if you get up close you can see how
dry it looks when it guys goes on the
skin looks very nice then it drives down
it's horrible I literally hate
it so I'm going to apply gonna put some
on the back of my hand and I
with my sponge it's definitely too dark
to meet in a minute because I remember I
bought this foundation when I just come
back a holiday I was returned um but
yeah like when it first goes on it
actually isn't the worst and then it
dries out and it just looks so
bad and my skin and it says it's
hydrating but it's definitely not like
it feels so dry and horrible and my skin
is oily and this makes me feel dry as
hell if you're dry you would absolutely
hate it
the reason why I bought it I remember is
because I follow this guy on Instagram
it's absolutely beautiful oh she's
unwell and she posted on her Instagram
story that she uses this foundation
she was exposing our pictures up and I
found it was explored I was like oh okay
let me try that that looks good
her skin looks amazing so uh yeah I
bought any just does not work for me I
saw I I've tried it so many different
times I've tried it with so many
different primers I would probably have
a brush with a part of a sponge I've
just tried so many different ways I've
even mixed it with other foundations
because it's expensive and I just wanted
to make sure I actually used it I don't
want to waste it but I can't I can't use
it
I really can't is horrible yeah as you
can see when I first applied it actually
doesn't look bad but waiting so it dries
down quite expect I cannot explain what
it looks like it looks like I have
really flaky dry skin that's where it
looks like when it dries her next thing
I don't like and this doesn't work for
me is their boying a benefit hydrating
concealer it's like a stick form kind of
thing and it's a really really sheer
concealer the reason why I like it is P
because it doesn't do anything for me it
doesn't cover my dark circles it creases
I've heard the only person that would be
able to use this product is if you
literally do not have anything to cover
like if you have no dark circles and you
have nothing wrong with your under eye
that's the only person I feel like could
use this and it would work for them and
then even then I just think you don't
need to use concealer if it's a shine if
you know any dark circles or nothing
wrong with your under-eye you don't even
need concealer so yeah I just don't see
the point in it as a concealer we wanted
to cover our dark circles you want to
kind of color correct all that kind of
stuff
and so for this being a concealer I'm
being so sheer
we're not doing anything it's just a bit
weird to me that's just yeah so I'm
gonna press in my it's Bunge but yeah
I'll it shoes and do anything for me
that's all so next thing I wanna do is
set my under oh I hate this product one
it makes them under I feel dry spark and
to you think you've got enough the
powder you take a picture on flash and
you look like you have you look like
you're baking stuff you know you haven't
even dusted it off it's a mess
this is the NYX HD studio photogenic
finishing powder it's hideous like this
is horrible honestly I have salutely
hate it it's not my worst nightmare
powder obviously is so white as well we
get a put aside from the fact that it
gives you flashback like it's so
dry as well under the eyes so I'm just
gonna set my under eye with this who
said the smell is really bad I really
just hate it it's horrible
I love NYX NYX is putting my favorite
drugstore brand affordable brand because
I love so much of their products like I
love their lip liners their liquid
lipsticks I love their foundation sticks
I love that contour kiss I love
everything that they do it pretty much
pothinus yes I hate those the glitters
are really nicest I real they are
already good brown but I just don't know
what they were thinking when they did
this yeah it just aside from the fact
that you get really clear splash back
like you think that you've dusted it all
off you think it looks fine and then you
take a picture on flash and it looks
like you're baking apart from that it
feels dry as on your I'm gonna move
on to my eyes and the next thing that I
read I like is the morphe eyelid primer
I just just first greasy and just feel
so sticky and isn't really doing much
doesn't really cover much Eva will say
um yeah I'm not a fan of this at all
just it just feels so greasy and you can
still see discoloration on my eyelids
underneath and when I want an eye to any
base I want it to cover and kind of just
create like a blank canvas for my
eyeshadow I don't want to be able to
still seeing my veins and the redness
underneath like that's not why one is
big
I don't like these products as well
doesn't mean they're bad products I mean
everyone's skin is different everyone's
preference is different so don't take it
as like me saying I hate these products
you should take these products because
that's not the case at all
obviously everyone is different so if
these work for you that's amazing but I
mean I could set that foundation I have
on now which I absolutely hate some girl
wears it and she absolutely flawless so
yeah it's just again it's different skin
types different preference and a lot of
kind of thing okay so don't actually
have an eyeshadow plant that I hate but
I do have a product that I hate and this
is the L'Oreal I paint I tried a few of
these colored ones like pretty 6 months
ago and they just go on so on Ethan they
crease throughout the day they don't
wear very nice they're just quite messy
like I just don't like them at all
redoing and I'm gonna put some pink in
my crease just normal shadow and then
I'm going to put that on I'll show you
what I mean also they sting my eyes they
just irritate my eyes I don't with puffy
eyes after I wear them so as you can see
this ice on it goes on very difficult
over this eyeshadow base it just doesn't
like go on right I told ok so I've just
put some normal pink shadow in my crease
because this is a pink eye pain so I'm
going to show you but yeah I just don't
like it at all and it's definitely in my
eye so I'm not looking for this - I'm
just gonna put it all over the lid got
it sting of my eyes already see yeah
it's hard to apply I find it messy as
 just gonna press it in my finger
I'm gonna try and press it in with this
brush in the inner corner because oh god
yeah it's just a nightmare
when you try to press it in with the
brush it takes up the product yeah as
you can see I just I think it's messy
stinging my eyes and it just creased so
far other day but I said like I use
years ago things first came out I tried
to silver one and it worked perfectly
fine so it's a bit confused I don't
think they're worth a still I think just
use a matte shadow on your on your lid
it's just a mess I read it I can't
really hate yeah
she posted mascara I don't particularly
like the Too Faced better than sex
mascara I find this transfers a lot and
I get like black smudges under my eyes
okay next is eyelashes and I wish you
have any eyelashes that I hate so I'm
just gonna move straight on yeah my eyes
up okay next thing is bronzer this is
that mua makeup academy pixel perfect
multi brothers I'll show you what it
looks like this is what it looks like
the color payoff and this is really
really bad I have to swell my brush up
up it's 10 million times to get any
color payoff it was who has gray bits in
it which makes you look very a she and
just muddy makes you look muddy not
bronze so I just yeah over here I like
it at all
see I'm gonna just smell my brush in
here 100 times try and get some color to
come off the rain just doesn't do
anything at all and yeah because it's
got these little gray bits in it it
makes you look muddy like it makes you
dirty rather than bronzed make sure that
you hate wash it about ten years leave
weeks later okay we're getting a little
bit of color ouch it's the same thing
they do a multi pixel brush as well
she's like this like I am literally
swelling my brush so hard in this and
it's just not doing anything oh yeah I
don't even feel it
okay well blush on and I said she stole
my washing that about 10 million times
so I'm over that
the next thing is from makeup Academy
again it's the undress your skin shimmer
highlight I don't like this because it's
it's a weird highlight it's like chalky
almost like it feels weird it feels dry
it feels it's not like a it's not good
airy highlight and it's not like a
really shiny highlight it's like a weird
situation I can't explain it but I just
don't like here look it looks weird and
it feels weird and it's not shiny and
it's not glittery it's like
really chocolate Joey looks like it
looks like you've got dry skin that's
what it looks like it doesn't look like
shiny
it doesn't look glowing is it look
glittery it looks like you've got dry
skin and from makeup Academy I love that
loose highlight they have a loose
highlight and it's so bomb but I
just hate their psyche no that is just
no okay next thing is lips and it's
actually from makeup revolution which
you guys know I love makeup revolution
by just don't neither lip products they
smell so strong or chemical I just hate
it I just yeah I just do not like that
at all
that's hate pin on my lips honestly and
so I'm gonna line my lips with this god
I look a hot mess I will say the lip
pencil is good but again it does smell
of chemical light does smell bad I don't
know why it smells like that this is the
lip gloss that comes with it again
stinks
save out of caracal I just hate I just
don't feel like I should be putting
someone else it's one of them Johnny
also their liquid lipsticks the same
they smell they smell even stronger than
the lipgloss on today this is a horrible
color on me as well that looks so
 bad but I mean whole face excite
rash oh it next thing I don't like
don't like this boven sup with the
makeup the Jared cause makes mystified
hydrating facial mist and this says
spray before or after your makeup
application to keep your skin hydrated
and smooth
I like this after the application
because this thing month of this
 here yeah sprays it so much
on your skin like no matter how far that
you try and spray it this
just likes to give you a whole bottle of
fries on her face and it's just very job
makeup
it smells unbelievable I like it before
makeup because it's not gonna remember
makeup but what after makeup is just not
okay I hope you're ready for this
because I'm not it's just horrible it's
too much
it comes out too much like if they just
changed that so that it comes out like
the fixed glass you know the fixed plus
comes out nice and just a little bit of
a spritz this comes out right in
your face at
if they change that I would really like
it because it is really nice it's a nice
spray I didn't have a spray that I
disliked apart from this one I don't
like this that's it that is the finished
video I hope you guys enjoyed this video
as I said this all comes down to
personal preference and my skin type and
these are products that do not work for
me perhaps I do not like but that's just
again like I said my personal preference
I'm not trying to say you should hate
this product too because like I said
everyone's did friend but yeah I hope
you guys enjoyed this video make sure to
give it thumbs up if you did please
subscribe and I will see you in my next
video I need to get lipstick off because
it smells like chemicals and I don't
like it he's getting whole thing off my
eyes resting in my facebook right I'm
gonna go cleanse my face bag</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
