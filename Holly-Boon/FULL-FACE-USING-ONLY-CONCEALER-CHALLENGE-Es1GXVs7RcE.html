channel and hello hi if you're new here
my name is gonna burn so in today's
video I'm gonna be doing the challenge
which is just like a full face of music
concealer I saw money MUAC this so I was
like okay I'm gonna try it because he's
actually looked quite good I was quite
shocked so yeah I'm gonna try it out so
I've just got in front of me
a whole bag of because he knows noise
didn't brands I've got models own
Maybelline Norman a two-faced makeup
revolution it was my just a few so right
let's do foundation first I'm just going
about the eyebrows no come on don't
think I have a concealer that would even
match my brows that were waiting worn
but anyway
so yeah I'm gonna start with my
foundation using concealer I'm going to
use my Laura Mercier one for this one
thing because I had the most shades and
okay this is it
this is a closest color that I have it's
like a foundation shade and this is the
Laura Mercier ox1 why because he
lighting the same for ends I'm just
gonna apply this one for me finish god
this was really we're doing this I
thought the face part is gonna be a
right it's just two eyes like that eye
shadow and brows I'm just terrified
this is gonna be so dark let me mix in
some Amish aid what opportunity over
three see let's try three see put a bit
that in there
alright lovely so I'm gonna use my
sponge to blend it in I'm Pete you
bender irene each pop my eyebrows
underneath got they grow so quickly I
popped them like two days ago and I've
already got like hairs underneath
okay so fiving likes a riot not the best
color match but let's get after dick
he's actually coming back half decent I
walk out like because I need to go out
yeah need to go get some stuff so I mean
if this
alright I'll just go out of here
no given some of its juices the
one you know summer it's summer fruits
it's the one so now it's we're gonna do
concealer on to the eyes I'm not gonna
use the Laura Mercier and we try to
always use as I love it because I'm
interested that used it foundation and
we're try something ours
what's this what is don't try this so
these are the models own full coverage
concealer I'm gonna go for medium number
two there's medium free medium to
actually meeting frequently have any
good foundation but never mind of mind
I've not actually tried this yet so this
is a first
wow those thick holy and that's
very pink okay hang on then we just see
what medium the thyroid it's like on the
back of my hand Wow my face is very
orange right now okay I'm gonna go a
medium number three because medium two
is too pink I don't want to arm it as
well you know so I'm gonna put some on
the back of my hand
this is so thick that's crazy I'm going
to use my Sigma F 75 brush I thought
this might crease on me but no I don't
know it's a bit of a tacky feel like
defeat a bit but the consistency fills
up my Beck are running corrector that's
not the same sort of consistency I so it
feels I said I know might be alright
which I'll see you be fancy and bring it
up over the eyes as well as some it's
gonna put a little bit on the eyes and
then I'm gonna put some here wow my
foundation car looks so bad I think it's
getting darker by the minute
 hopefully this right now okay I'm
gonna bend it with my sponge okay this
can see if there's alright it's
definitely a full coverage I think it
looks right whoops they need to see if
it creases or anything but that is a
full coverage and the consistency of it
is literally like it's like a bit sticky
it's like the backdrop brightening crowd
I said
which I like that for my undereye that's
like your live bet with my actual
foundation collected me it looks really
light but it's medium but it's because
this this foundation well this conceal
as foundation looks like dark actually
contour so come time let's use my makeup
relation can see into fire in the shade
see 14 but this is quite cool concealer
it's not very warm so it was good for
contouring okay little bit just a little
bit a little bit I say I mean scrap
story yesterday I've got um tape and
extensions and I'm my face out is so
slick right now and so flat and you
can't see any extensions with my bonds
it was just so impossible to get slick
ponytail because you just have a little
bumps there just be so annoying but like
these breathing plane myself you know
I'm excited but yeah since you like I
said on Instagram and snapchat I'm gonna
give it a month and let you know I think
because I want to see what they're like
when they grow out a little bit and
stuff who said they were so much more
comfortable and we're like I don't even
feel like I have extensions in it's just
so it's so much better when I had um I
was just getting fed up with bottoms
because so just when they grow up they
get at my head and then they're just so
much more I think end up being more
expensive because that with these you
can just get them out and put back in
the same hair so you can bring you to
the hair over and over and it's just you
have to just pay for maintenance whereas
when you get born once I've grown out
you can't reuse the hair so you have to
pay for new hair every single time it's
just it's so expensive
okay so far I don't think I look too bad
okay my are to use powder it's another
thing my let's use powder cuz money did
use power dose a ton believes a bit of
powder upset because I actually it's
simple right you know I shall try and
make it look good okay I'm gonna set
this because I went to look good when
setting with my Patrick Starr Mac powder
miss at the whole faith
scared for eyebrows I just know the
eyebrows are just not gonna work la
my hair is like blue-black and my eyes
are going to be warm it's just gonna pop
man well we're dry okay so yeah that's
dude for hours next I'm trying to think
that the worse the dog is concealing I
have inhale
okay you know what the darkest can see
though I have is that makeup revolution
c14 consider divine which I just used to
contour so yeah she's gonna look bad I
just realized that I was so far zoomed
out so it just zoomed in I was like oh
geez I'm gonna come on my brows I'm
gonna use my Sigma angled a 75 brush and
I'm gonna use the concern in defying and
c14 which is just the wrong color I'm
scared oh oh my god stop that this is so
bad I'd do anything just showing up very
well anyway because my eyebrows are dark
it doesn't it the worse is blending in
pretty well with my other bribry hair
once it's dry in its drying it a bit
darker so that's not too bad and I feel
like it's blending in okay okay I don't
get the eyebrows she looks up bad I
thought there's clinic horrendous I love
I've got highlights in my brows not I
mean okay I'm gonna use my Born This Way
can see laughs from Too Faced in the
shade tan and I'm gonna put a little bit
this on my eye at that then I'm gonna
use this Mac 207 brush I'm gonna press a
on my leg
oh my god
so that Brendan's nothing actually I can
so I'm using the born so I can see it on
put some dots above my crease brush
okay where do the same on this side so
far we did i okay so I will do a bit
like a brown maybe surprise make yo
that's the only thing here we try and a
so I'm gonna use my Barry M full
coverage concealer in the shade six and
I'm gonna put this all over the lid just
like a warm brown and then I'm gonna use
the same brush and I'm gonna press the
air caucus is a makeup tutorial I would
depart okay you know why I stabbing it
except bar but it's definitely gonna
crease I thought because it's concealer
I'm gonna say it with some powder she's
a little bit of translucent on the
sponge just a tiny tiny bit the only
thing I think I would just definitely
change in my browser than honestly okay
let me do my under eye so let's go back
to that town from all this way I'm gonna
put this on my eye this is so weird
does not feel right at all okay then I'm
going to use my barium conceal I'm gonna
put it back me and do the same thing
jeonhwa if you were ever just like
stranded somewhere or ghetto if you just
only happen to have concealer you can't
make it work you know so I'm gonna set
that again with a little bit of powder
okay I'm gonna put some lashes I love
Cameron and I'll be back so I'll see you
in a sec so just stuck some lashes on
and put some bot mascara does he really
like up got any eye makeup on I don't
know what happened but it just it looks
