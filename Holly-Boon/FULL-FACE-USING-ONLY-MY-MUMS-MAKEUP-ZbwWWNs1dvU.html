channel hello if a new here welcome
welcome welcome you are so welcome and
so today I decided to do a video a full
face using my mom's makeup because I saw
Michael finishes the video ages ago and
I was dying it was so funny and then I
saw nikkietutorials do this videos where
I was like I would want to do that I
think it'd be hilarious
so I've got my mom's makeup like here
she's actually got a nice Victoria
Secret bag which I actually gave her but
yeah I'm gonna use her makeup I'm scared
how much at all like at all okay she has
this cream from norio which is a
rehydrating day cream and it's an age
for cream so I'm gonna okay it's empty
she has my left thanks mom thanks for
that she I was like what the back I know
what is this okay we will use this
inside this isn't your like primer from
L'Oreal so let's give this a go
my mom niches away like how do you only
make up she mess up amazing skin her
skin is so good and see how she doesn't
really wear like any makeup at all
really
so this is actually pretty gonna be the
shortest video a baa-baa okay that
doesn't feel too bad she purrs nice my
lips are so dry on my god okay my mom
does not have a lip balm but I need to
put a lip balm because my lips are so
dry my mom does not have eyebrow for
like she does not do her eyebrows she
just leaves that I was alone so that's
annoying but let's see what she has in
here okay she has this mineral magic
powder which looks like this she's been
watching QVC let me tell you this is on
the shopping channel mom even watching
QVC and yeah I think she is that does
she even use that
oh my god okay she also has this BB
cream from Gagne and it's in the shade
medium it's a five in one daily
moisturizer but house obviously it's
just like a tinted moisturizer so I'm
gonna use this and then use that magic
powder oh this looks really messy okay
okay I know for a fact she uses her
hands but couldn't you have any brushes
I just give her makeup she doesn't even
use it so I said to her I really need to
get you into concealer cuz she doesn't
wear concealer
she doesn't want concealer what okay wow
this is too light for me
he's very pinky as well mom it's very
pink okay so I'm gonna take this minimal
magic powder which like I said she's
everything I love QVC she's definitely
be watching the chakra channel so she's
got this brush this big powdery brush
I'm gonna use this wow this looks white
hey we have no I shadow we have no
concealer we have this little blush okay
mom no what is that it's like broken
there's like the tiniest bit there my
god oh oh okay she has a new one here
she has a new one of the same one so is
she sister Josie uses this could looks
very used this is a room London blush in
the shade 20 and then I'm just gonna
take this powder brush again cuz she
don't really have any brushes my mom
really loves mascara like my mum weighs
like nothing like just literally cream
and mascara and she gets away because
her skin is so good
she got me into skincare at such a young
age I'm really grateful for that mom
thanks that when I was like 14 she used
to get me a nice skin care stuff so
bright I'm grateful for her for that
thanks mom she has black eyeliners this
one I go for the other day at she's a
Marc Jacobs one but she has this one and
it's rhabdo I think it's ruined under
just one and then mascara she has this
volume million lashes walk for a buscar
oh she loves what proof mascara on mom
she loves it
fish on our common scars run so let's
try this
umm this is very unhygienic of me to use
my mascara every day is fine it's fine
I'll buy a new one so I just don't have
like any lashes this is the problem it's
so funny that I look nothing like my mom
I look exactly like my dad but if you
saw my mom you'd be like is that even
your mom I don't feel like we look
anything alike
maybe the eyes actually we both have red
eyes what is this mom loves L'Oreal by
the looks of things so this is the
L'Oreal lipstick in the shade three Oh -
she does have this black eyeliner I
don't think she wears black ara√±a I
think she just has it in her bag but I'm
going to use anyway I don't think she
uses this I'm pretty certain she doesn't
use it but aren't my god how
okay so I'm gonna use this Marc Jacobs
cloth which I actually gave for this
because this is like so her colors she
loves like that like these sort of
colors she loves it so yeah I'm gonna
but I think she guys deceiver it mu she
does sometimes I can't do mom what is
this we do have some bronzer here from
Oprah this is the Oprah Egyptian clay
bronzer so it's like a shimmery bronzer
which I'm a huge fan of but yes
try this oh my god yeah so I'm using the
same brush because this is the only
watch that she has her mom has this
iconic London shimmer palette which is -
hi-hi palette shout out to iconic London
and she's got this Marc Jacobs like flat
brush I'm just going to use this I'm
gonna use this shade I think this one
should shine a little bit I definitely
think she needs some considering I live
because she's always like we've got
these dark circles under my eyes I'm
like mom you just need a tiny bit of
concealer under your eyes and you'll be
loved in your life it makes someone from
awake so I'm gonna go get her a nice
concealer today
okay sorry that is all of the makeup
that she uses is everything that she has

concealer but yeah I hope you guys
