channel and hello if you're new here
welcome hi my name is Huy boon so I
thought I'd do a get ready with me today
I'm gonna just get ready cuz I'm going
up for food so yeah also I've got some
of the jello in got collection which I'm
so excited to try it looks so amazing
and I'm most excited to try this living
the highlight like blues highlight it
just looks phenomenal I'm so I'm just
excited for that those are my brows of
camera because they just takes so long
to do I'm just gonna apply some oil cuz
I feel really do hard but my skin just
feels very dehydrated and this is the
enemy's pro-collagen marine oil
I would actually run out of it and it's
my favorite it's so nice
so I'm not gonna do a really like base
I'm gonna use concealer to cover up my
brows just like a dog I love a kid oh my
just like a soft round I want it too
intense eye shadow today because I want
to do a really sharp wing I'm going to
use my Laura Mercier flawless fusion
ultra Longwear concealer in the shade 3w
what is now what is no have you seen
that Mac are coming out with the Studio
Fix concealer in I think September and
watching it I cannot wait
I love the Studio Fix foundation so I'm
really excited for that the one thing I
love about this brush on this concealer
as you can actually use it to carve out
your brows I'm just gonna go over if my
Beauty Blender is going to press it in
just going to take off any excess
product because I don't want too much
and then I am going to set that with
some translucent powder because this
concealer it's not an eyeshadow basis it
kind of slips and slides around if you
don't set it I really feel like I should
probably change this backdrop but I love
it I just love the page so summery but I
feel like I've had the peach backdrop
now for like four videos I feel like I
should change it but I love it so I'm
going to try out this Jennifer Lopez
Inglot collection like I said and this I
don't know if this is an eyeshadow
palette or if this is like a bronzer and
three highlights I mean I don't really
know but I'm going to use this prong to
color anyway
in my crease this palette is magnetic I
really like I think it's really cool
I've never seen that long and be I'm
gonna take this bronzy color here I'm
gonna use it in my crease it was this
fluffy brush I'm just gonna buff this in
the crease and just above the crease as
well see I kind of just want to give the
crease and definition thumbs it up a
little bit and then I'm just gonna do
like a sharp wing so I'm not gonna do
too much eye makeup it's in like
eyeshadow i normally use bronzers in the
crease anyway so i'm not sure if it's in
the bronze or if this is a place to be
an eyeshadow i'm not sure and but i
always normally use bronzers in the
crease when i do this sort of thing
because then it matches the bronze are
not using my skin so it kind of all ties
together cos gonna ask you guys so i'm
moving out over the next sort of two
months and i just wanted to know if you
guys want to see more like vlogs i'm
just about my day and stuff like I can
make a vlog channel or I can put them on
here I don't mind I wanna sleep make our
videos of course um I love makeup but I
just kind of wonder if you learn more
like personal vlog style videos cuz yeah
I think that'd be quite fun today just
like more vlog style videos and but just
let me know if you want me to do that or
not
let me know if you think I should even
make a separate channel for that or just
post them on here so I love that color
increase I think that looks really nice
I'm just gonna deepen up a little bit
more when you use a darker Brown I'm
gonna use my morphe M 502 palette and
I'm glues this coming right here I'm
gonna apply that in the crease this
little brush by the way blank canvas e
10 brush they this is so good for
getting really precise blending is
honestly one of my favorite brush I have
about a three of these and I just love
this brush and it's only six pounds I've
got mine of beautybay they're just so
good at such a good brush is also is
gonna ask you guys if anybody is I pay
is good at interior design is good at
just knowing what goes with what
can you just yeah can you just message
me let me know because I am really part
of it I just don't know what goes with
what or what things look good before
I've read just don't know I'm society
yeah so like a bit confused in a bit
overwhelming so just ask you guys to ask
me some questions I'm going to answer
what I do
my makeup I have Eddie Jane said
favorite someone's get ready to know I
have actually like Tigers new track I
feel like he kind of fell off for a
little while like I didn't really like
his music but tonight he came out with
what is it called
I keep listening to it I highly what
it's called one of his new ones but I do
I do actually read I kept listening to
that a lot recently
Nicola said what was your favorite on my
clothing website to order from I think
I'll have to be pretty little thing but
the only thing I find pretty little
thing sometimes is the delivery it's
more a delivery service like is it her
homers or whatever they my guys I
ordered some stuff from ready for my
holiday and it didn't come and I think
my okay next is different like wise not
having second fuse it was like three
days later and I was like ways going on
contacted the delivery service and I was
like what's going on why's my past and
hand stuff and they were like oh sorry
it's damaged in transit so you can't
deliver it and I was thinking why don't
you tell me this you know I mean like
and then um yeah that was long I had to
get a refund and reorder thought it was
so long and then as well with that
delivery service
it's we've kinda like all of those types
of runs I'm describing and so I feel
like they always use that delivery it's
just so there was another time as well
my pastor didn't turn up and I was like
what's going on like weather parcel and
then I emailed pretty little thing they
were like well we sent it out and then
so icons a delivery service and they
were like oh like we've delivered it and
I was like but you haven't liked having
to do it it's not in my house so I'm
like searching around my house I'm
setting the been since I've closed have
been known stood up before and searching
right everywhere from my parcel can't
find it nowhere so I kind of just like
was like okay let me just wait like a
week and then I forgot about it I
actually forgot about it and then it
turned up and it had been duct-taped
like somebody had opened it took some
things out and then closed it and put
duct tape around it and then delivered
it to me and there was loads of stuff
missing I was like what the hell is
going on so yeah we'll say that delivery
services do put me off ordering off the
website if I know that there's a crappy
delivery service it's going to be
delivering my parcel I probably wait
order from the website
because of that really because I just
I've had so many bad experiences of
delivery is Emily glad I'm not a part
tool for this bit because I want myself
I'm going to use my NYX applying a
liquid liner which is the black one this
one doesn't actually crack and this one
is quite dark but the only problem is it
doesn't dry down matte so I wish is put
a black eyeshadow on top of it and it
goes it looks really good so anyway I'm
looking sharp
baby okay so I'm gonna pick up some
black eye shadow from that morphe
palette I'm just gonna press that on top
of that liner and this brush is my two
three four locks make you show you two
brush so if you are somebody that has
oily eyelids and you feel like every
time we do your line now you get
transfer so you end up getting smudges
up here then definitely set your
eyeliner with black eyeshadow just gonna
put some gel liner in my top waterline
I'm gonna use my Sigma gel liner in the
shade wicked which is black and this
little brush is my Sigma heuristics
brush which is one of my faves
so JLo in block collection has a jet
black mascara so I'm gonna put some
where top lashes well this is gonna make
any difference to my lashes case my
lashes are crap so for my lashes I'm
going to use the Lily lashes and the
style Miami and everybody seems to love
this style of Lily lash so I really
wanted to just try it for myself so I
think so I'm just going to trim a little
bit off the outer corner just a tiny bit
so it's a little bit smaller but always
cut from the outer corner not the inner
corner kid that's better
and I'm gonna use my house of lashes
eyelash glue so I'm relieved that lash
glue to dry down for a little bit okay
wish me I'll probably forget so just
using my twice outwalk ours primer and
next question is what's the hardest
lesson that life has given you and how
did you overcome it and I feel there's
been quite few things that I felt like I
was never going to be able to overcome
and yeah I just I don't know I feel like
everything that happens to you and
everything that you go through makes you
a better person it makes you who you are
and I feel like if I didn't go through
certain things I probably won't
be as much of a strong person as I am I
feel like I'm still I'm not the
strongest person don't get me wrong like
I am a cancer and you that's my stance
on and we are quite sensitive we can be
quite sensitive so I'm not always not
really strong my definitely think I
would be way weaker as a person if I
went on to marry certain situations and
certain things those situation where I
went through where people were trying to
ruin my life for about five four to five
years and they would they would started
on one of my friends and then I jumped
in and stuck up her because she was
quite shy and like Timmy didn't stick up
for herself and I stuck up ahead and it
was switched on me and they would always
always always do things and say things
to me being like so violent to me
because I would always retaliate I would
always retaliate and I always like fight
back and I would always say something
back and because of that they thought it
was funny and they would do it just
continuously for so long and they still
try and do it now and they see me around
I don't I just ignore it now obviously
I'm like I'm a better person from that
I've learned you cannot fight you that's
what they want they want a reaction out
of me and I'd the time for so long
people would say just ignore it just
ignore it and I just couldn't I really
couldn't just ignore it and then I would
always just yeah always just try and
fight my corner I always try and say
something bad back which never made me
any better than them and innocence but I
always it was just like this the whole
defence thing like I had like I want you
to tick off myself like I was so angry
the things I have burned
what's got got so out of hand to the
point where I didn't even want to leave
my house I was too scared and there was
a situation where I went out with my
friends and one of them came up to me it
was really drunk and spat in my face and
I had a drink thrown in my art in my
face when I was at a club with one of my
friends and someone's happened the
toilet area for a drink in my face and
and that was just in a way that was kind
of my own fault because they would
always start and I would always bite
back and so they would always do it and
I always felt like I was on my own with
that situation because
my friends are bright look honey you
can't keep retiring you can't keep this
is what they want and never gonna stop
if you keep doing this and at the time I
couldn't see what they were trying to
tell me and I just kept trying to fight
my corner and I got such a bad place in
my life where I just felt like on my own
I really felt on my own with everything
I don't know I kind of felt like it was
gonna ruin me in the end I really felt
like and something bad was gonna happen
to me I just had that in my head I was
like they're gonna do something really
bad to me and I'm really scared oh my
god see I really felt like something was
gonna happen because the verbal stuff
that they started with which I would
also tell you it when started to be
physical and they started to do physical
things to me and there were so many
situations and I stopped throwing out I
stopped going up my friends I stopped
going anywhere I was just scared I was
so terrified I'm not a violent person I
would never fight back in that sense
what I did used to like mouth off back
to them has never met type of person but
I always felt on my own and I was so
defensive and I was like I'm not gonna
let them do this to me like and I was so
angry at the world I was like so angry
at them they loved I would always react
to it and I was always on my own it was
with me again it's like the a of
them yeah so got to the point where I
didn't want to leave my house because
yeah I start to get physical I didn't
really tell anyone about the situation
because I I don't know I just would lock
myself in my room I wouldn't leave and I
just trying to act like you know I can
do this I can do with it and stuff and
then after all of that just fell in love
with makeup and I was like you know what
this is what I want to do I love makeup
and in that time where I was really
really down something so good came from
it where I was always watching YouTube
and I'm with always I felt like inspired
and it made me get out of a bad place
makeup helped me get out of a bad place
never something that Evan wanted to talk
about or ever felt like I want it's open
up about because it's just a time where
I just don't want to remember I don't
want to remember that time in my life at
all so yeah look makeup became and
get from me and then you two became more
of an escape for me I was like well
makeup and YouTube is just somewhere
where I can go and I can get away from
all this that's happening and all
just hurt that I was being in I could
get away from me and I could just sit
down I'm filming video is when I was in
that girl grew it wasn't that girl band
the management she was one of my close
friends in the end like she is six hours
this week um she used to be like worried
because these people would just do so
much to try and ruin my life it really
was that they really wanted to ruin my
life this is why I always say I love
said this before on here is you know
people tell you just ignore it ignore it
you actually do have to just try it nor
it and it it's so hard because you
always want to fight your corner you
always want to say something back to
hurt their feelings but that never ever
ever what it's never a good solution
it's never the right thing to do and
that's why it never stopped and that's
why it went on for so many years because
they would always get a reaction out of
me and it was only when I found so much
peace and happiness from YouTube and
just being able to come in here and be
myself and you guys like what I do and
stuff and I just put so much of my time
and so much of my effort so much of my
energy into YouTube and just this whole
thing then I just started to forget
about all of that bad stuff and I
started to kind of reflect on myself and
just have a word to myself and say you
know what if you keep fighting anger
with more anger this is never ever ever
going to end
and people would tell me it for years
and I had to learn it for myself and it
clicked in my head one day and I was
like you know what they're so right I
cannot keep fighting hey bruh pay
because they love that that's what they
want they want a reaction there will be
to keep them in it they want me to keep
reacting because they think it's funny
and they love that they can wine me up
and they love this and get reaction and
for so many years I did not listen to
anyone I did not I listened to no one
and that's the thing if sometimes you do
have to learn things on your own and you
have to learn things the hard way and I
start to find happiness again doing
YouTube and doom
a cup that I took a step back and I
looked and I was like wow like I need to
just ignore it
I've never felt so at peace and so happy
until I started YouTube and that's a
fact it took me a long time took me long
to I hated myself for so many years I
hated myself more until I was 20 and I
hate myself I hate in my life I I
resented so much in my life and there
was so much that happened on top of
all of that as well but at the same time
I feel like everything everything does
happen for a reason sometimes you have
to learn things the hard way and yeah
that was just the situation and that's
probably one of the hardest things I had
to overcome because it was so long and
it was so many years and it went on for
such a long time and I really didn't
think it would ever stop I read it in go
in his seven and eight I would get
bullied because I had frizzy hair and I
had goofy teeth if I hadn't had braces
on my teeth were really bad and you
could did she fit a pound coin between
my front teeth and people were said to
meet all the time I had really frizzy
hair and I didn't want to make and
people would say things and I think they
kind of thought it was bad ah but I was
really shy and timid at that stage in my
life I was really quiet I wasn't really
like I didn't have many friends and the
friends that I did have got put in
different classes to me so I was always
that kind of on my own and I remember I
would come home I'd cry and my mom would
ruin the school and she'd be like look
is there any way that you can change her
and put her in classes that she has
friends and they went do it they were
like no because I wasn't very
intelligent I was slightly dyslexic so I
had to be in this class and I remember
in summer year a I was like mom I'm not
going back to school unless I have
braces and I started to wear a little
bit makeup at that stage and when I went
back to school I was straightening my
hair oh I could became obsessed with
straightening my hair because people
would say oh my god no she's got frizzy
hair and would always have the piss out
my frizzy hair so I would I would
literally straighten my hair like three
times a day
for when Tibet after betting that when I
got back from school almost rating my
hair and my hair I had in I ended up
having to cut my hair off because it was
so damaged but yeah went back to school
and I started my makeup straightening my
hair and started to look at braces and
people left me alone I think that's why
the second time it started to happen
when I stuck up for my friend they
switched on me I was so I wanted to
stick up for myself and I would say bad
things back and it was because I had it
happened to me before
and I didn't want to just be that quiet
person that went stick up for ourselves
again because that's who I was when it
first happened I was really quiet I
didn't ever stick up for myself so then
when it started to happen again the same
situation when I was older I was like no
I'm not letting this happen to me again
and I would always fight back and that
is not the answer but yeah I thought was
so long I felt peace of weddings
 life yeah that's one thing
I would say to you if someone's being
horrible to you don't be horrible that
one it doesn't make you any better than
them and two it will never end they'll
just keep doing it and keep doing it
because they want to get a reaction I
had to learn to the hard way took
me a long time to learn it everything
that happens to us happens to us for a
reason everything that we're going
through we go through for a reason
please just try to find a positive any
negative situation the situations
happenings even make you a stronger
person make you a better person and yeah
