Oh
hey everyone so today I'm going to be
filming a just a face tutorial today
just how to get that very nice summer
glow to your skin I've been using new
products a to social interests and the
review all so yeah I mean get started
straightaway and the first thing I've
been using is the Mac strobe cream this
is in the shade pink light I do think
I'm gonna have to get the gold while I'm
going to do a goldish one but this still
works really worked really well we just
give you that very nice the luminous
effect under your foundation
yeah I'm just going to put some of this
on the back of my hands and then I'm
going to take my Sigma round kabuki
brush and I'm going to apply this with
my kabuki brush I'm just going to apply
this kind of like the cheekbones and
just above the brow forehead I don't
want to play everywhere loudly in my
t-zone so I'm going to try and just have
one more to zone area but yeah so just
cheekbones and then come around this
area here as you can see each species
can exert a nice and glowy so full
foundation or has recently sent the Too
Faced Born This Way Foundation like why
the am I tried this before it's so
good I've went a couple of times and
yesterday and the day before I wore it
all day and I just I really really like
it it's a really really nice foundation
mister oil-free it's medium to full
coverage so there are six new shades of
this launch and soon m22 face calm on
the 15 15 and then the 16 shades are
coming to Debenhams
and subsidies on August the 1st so there
are a total of 24 shades in this
foundation I am going to be using the
shade golden and I did use the shade
golden tan I got in beige yesterday but
I feel like it was maybe a little bit
too dark for this
so yeah this this College definitely
vessel and I'm just applying this with
my Sigma free D blender so this
foundation is medium and buildable to
full coverage it's really an awesome
skin it's I'm not on that finish it
gives you that climate radiant skin so
yeah that is a finish for the Fandango
Mac strobe cream underneath it's just
given that really nice glow under this
foundation I'm just really really really
nice really nice glowy skin which is
what we want and so next we take my NARS
radiant creamy concealer in the shade
ginger I'm also going to bring this
conceded down the size of runner is as
well it's going to apply a little bit on
my forehead here and then down the
bridge of my nose and on the end of my
nose I put two dot spots here and
they're really really painful
keep picking and ready to start then
taking my 3d blender by Sigma I'm going
to blend this and whoever did come for
every Sigma which is just Halle and you
get money off
so when I set a tiny bit under my eyes
using my Laura Mercier translucent
powder are you literally the tiniest bit
just so it doesn't crease and then
everywhere else I'm just going to apply
a little bit of powder because I don't
want to or see big maps so I'm just
going to apply a bit of powder from so
I'm going to apply powder here and
minimizes my pores you kind of want to
avoid this area for powder just so that
when we come to use the illuminator
drops it just applies a better so I'm
then going to cream contour and I'm
going to use my pigment stick from
iconic London in the shade 4.1 just
going to apply a little bit to my
forehead a cheekbone and my jaw line and
then again I'm reading my 3d blender
I've got two by the way I'm using one
for powder 1/4 creams you don't want to
use the one that you just use for powder
to use for cream we had some of the two
days in England and I was going back to
 weather standard to this country
have you ever tried to blend with the
other hand like with your sponge in the
other hand so difficult
oh my god it's really difficult and this
gives me our make here the means go
to the gym when you can from the end
goal it's you what I'll make sober my
contour goes crazy on camera but in
person isn't I'll come as always tire me
always okay so next thing I'm going to
do is I'm actually just going to put a
tiny bit of powder underneath my contour
here so came down a bit cheaper so the
next thing is I'm going to take my
iconic London
illuminated drop sitting in the shade
original I'm going to just put
somebody's in the back of my hand and
I'm going to use my 3d render again so
when I ever use and then yeah I'm going
to apply these once you can see that see
that see that already well yes if you
are when you're applying powder on your
just try and avoid your cheekbone area
and because if you try and pay these
illuminator up sometimes on top of where
you put those a powder it will just go
that like in just separate no go patchy
so just I would just a word powder in
this area wherever you're going to apply
the illuminator drops just avoid powder
in go here as well just above my well
maybe not not much it keeps going to
bring this all the way around as well so
RAL in my eyebrow yeah the globe is so
real right now
client there and then because there's
going to do the same on the other side
I guess they carried away I start
winning tonight replies everywhere I'm
going up lessons like boarding in a
minute I'll show you suggest it's so
good but when I'm super super do we like
so glowy after doing my body as well was
if anything it's weird do you know what
I mean just going to dust off this
powder on top of that glow I'm going to
apply some more glow because I mean can
you ever have too much I'd lightning say
so I'm going to use the dose of colors
gold is the new black this has been one
of my favorites for the last of we cover
news news every day and a reread of it
and then I'm going to use my morphe M
510 brush I'm going to spray some six
flowers on the brush
well I fix Leslie Kenny you're right
just want to make sure the brush is a
bit dry so did spray on there one thing
though we're ready
alright alright I need to get in the gym
what do I know suck it bingo wings a key
okay so I'm gonna then apply this on top
of my eyes like that so because we want
to risk roll on the back face I want to
apply some to the body so again I'm
going to take my illuminate interrupts
okay see I'm just using this to a fiber
powder brush by Sigma and just using
these illuminated drops all over my
chest area
what the summer guys say right now
sorry Jay no but you need to need the
 out the way because I mean if you
don't really have these drops in your
eyes I'm not being funny you need them
okay I'm just going to apply some blush
I'm going to take my California from
benefit on my large powder brush from
Sigma silicone eat above the last
airflow so from my lip color on breast
we're going to take the NYX sways matte
lip liner in the shade 33 and I'm going
to use the NYX lingerie liquid lipstick
in the shade cashmere silk and then on
top of that when you use my NYX butter
gloss in the shade Madeline and then
lastly I'm going to spray my faces some
6 plus hi that noise is really hooded
and it was so much very my body as well
I can even find a breeze so that is how
I got this absolute go first and loving
life and I always use when I'm on
holiday I also use whenever a maxi
dresses always put low to go here and
had a glow on my face because I just
love glow in the summer especially all
the time but especially in the Sun and
