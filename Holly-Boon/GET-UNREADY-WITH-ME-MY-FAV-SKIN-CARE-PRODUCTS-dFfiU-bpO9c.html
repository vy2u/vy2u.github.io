youtube channel if you're new here it's
nice to meet you if you like people that
rap shit' a lot of and just
whatever then make sure you subscribe I
thought today I would film would get I'm
ready with me what I used to make path
what kind of skin care routine that I
tend to do and I have quite a lot of
products and Albany's all these products
because these are kind ones I like
alternate like sometimes I use like
certain one sometimes they use different
ones like I kind of switch it up but
these are like overall like my favorites
so I'm gonna just show you I use and
take my makeup off so the first thing I
like to do when I take my makeup off is
I like to use the Urban Decay makeup
remover this is a meltdown makeup
remover i dissolve it and spray you
spray on your face it makes you much
makeup off I love this stuff I've been
using it now for about a month does it
she dis much left in there I need to get
a new one but I love this so much it is
like I used to use wipes and then
cleanse but I thought this gets more of
my makeup off so I preferred this and it
can be a bit messy so I've got a bottle
of water here I'm talking when it sprays
on my face that's my makeup off and then
I'm gonna use a towel and just wet the
towel on then wipe it off and take my
lashes off I'm gonna it's like the best
feeling ever
next to taking a bra off the end of the
day this is the next best thing like
taking your eyelashes are just wears on
now yeah then it starts to break down
the makeup sandwich this time tuna
wet the town or next to me and then with
the towel I'll just gently wipe away
that I cut I'm not gonna cleanse my skin
I'll do this twice I used to drink
lenses so the first way I'd like to use
is the enemy's pro-collagen cleansing
balm this has got a new one of these I
use my I've won the whole thing like I
was i obsess oh use everyday and then I
kind of had a break from it use
different stuff that I've warm up to it
now I love it
so yeah this is a pro-collagen cleansing
mom so what I will do is when you buy
the cleansing mummy get like a little
cloth that comes of it which is really
handy so I just take about this on my
hands I'll rub it on my skin and then I
will remove it with like a done I've
just made this a bit damp and this time
a cloth this smells like spa like it
smells so good but you can see how much
extra makeup this is getting off like
you think you get it all off of a makeup
remover and then you cleanse your skin
you're like oh okay the Anna Cabrini
gutka my skin guy was just using makeup
wipes which is so bad so yeah I just
started my skincare routine again and my
skin's cleared up so good how much extra
makeup has come off of me doing this I'm
by no means a skin person I don't have a
 clue what it's like good and
what's not
this is just what works for me if you
have like quite bad skin you don't
really know like how to treat your skin
like what you're better off just going
and seeing a skin specialist to be
honest because there are the best people
and then we know exactly what you need
to do so I'm quite blessed in a sense
that I've never had acne and in my genes
like we will have quite good skin and my
family like everyone has really good
skin my mum has very clear skin my
sister has a really fierce killer
everyone in my family has really clear
skin so I think it's a gene I think is
my genes like I am just read blessed in
that sense but like I said if you do
have acne prone skin or if you have like
I know excess oil and stuff like that
you're better off seeing skin specialist
because I mean I'm not I already know
too much masking guard is not works for
me so the other one I use it should not
turn it for that one this one is the
Charlotte silvery multi miracle-gro and
you can use this as a cleanser and you
can also put a little bit of this on and
you can leave overnight and it gives you
that really baby soft skin so I mean
sometimes I will just use a little bit
of this not as it comes up but kind of
after I've done everything and then
sleep in it wash off in the morning my
skin is first baby so okay so the other
two cleansers that I like to use are
from Mario Badescu I love Mario Badescu
I've never used anything from the range
that I've not liked so if you're on a
budget they're super affordable and
really really good products so these are
other two cleanses I like to use
then when you use one of these now so
this was a lotion and this one's like a
foamy cleanser
they both have glycolic acid in them so
they are a little bit stronger than the
normal cleanser so I'm gonna up today I
think I think I'm gonna go for the
lotion which I use a like round cotton
wall pass apply this so I'm just gonna
take a couple of these and I'm just
gonna squirt some of this on a cotton
wool pad like this and then I'm just
gonna do circular motions my skin you'll
be surprised as well how much product
will still come out my skin even after
cleansing and doing that makeup not what
I'd always still be product on my skin
it's crazy so the fact that I went for a
stage of only using a makeup wipe it did
search shows that's why I was breaking
out you can still see you look you can
still see that there's still product
coming off my skin even after cleansing
and using a makeup milk-vetch a really
important it's really really important
especially if you wear makeup a lot like
me like I said like I am lucky that in
my family it's kind of like jeans I feel
like I have good skin but if I do that
if I feel like if I didn't have really
good skin Oh naturally
and I just would use a makeup wipes and
not get all the product of my skin I
would probably be breaking out like all
over my face so crazy so I really do
advise that you really do invest in a
skincare routine
if anyone's like trained in skincare
know loads about skincare please comment
below in the comment section and just
let us know like what you advise I
advise me to do it what you advise
someone with like acne skin because I
want to be able to afford to go see a
skin specialist so if you know a lot
about skin and you're watching this
video please have my subscribers are and
just comment below what you think they
should do or like what certain certain
skin types supposed to do like if I'm
doing the right
think I should change something like
just let me know because honestly I
don't know much about skincare at all
okay another cleanse up I have got the
other day from M&amp;amp;S because I was at
Todd's house and I didn't bring any
skincare of meeting is I just completely
forgot so I went to M&amp;amp;S I just picked up
some skin can't honestly M&amp;amp;S have some
really good products in there like some
really good products so I picked up this
hyaluronic acid brighten in hot cloth
cleanser
I don't brand this is just I think just
M&amp;amp;S beauty but I picked up this cleanser
and this is another really really good
one I've been using this a few times and
I really liked it
it comes with a really nice cloth and
what you do you kind of just put on your
dry skin rub it all in and then it's
used to cloth to remove the cleanser so
yeah that's another cleanser that I like
she's the difference between this one
this one this one's a lotion and this
one's a foaming cleanser and these are
both really good so if you're on a
budget then go to Mario Badescu because
they have so many good products okay so
this is something I'm not going to do at
the moment this is something that I do
once a week i exfoliate my face and I'll
actually is the new glycolic scrub fix
I've used this for about a month now and
I love this product so much I like I
said I won't use everyday you don't want
to exfoliate your skin every day that's
just like too much but I just do it like
once a week maybe twice a week sometimes
just depends and just to remove any dead
skin and yeah I just think it's really
important to use a face scrub so this is
one that I love this one's not expensive
at all and it's pretty really good so if
you're looking for a good face scrub use
this one I use this in the shower I keep
this into my bathroom and I just have a
shower and I use it in the shower and
wash it off in the shower that's what
works best for me but yeah this one is
really really good
okay so next time I talk about a mask so
this mask is something that I've been
using if you've been following me for a
while I've uses and snapchat so me times
like up or use this mask sit for about
six months so this is the alpha Beauty
power pill and she's an overnight power
pillow which supercharge of the skin
while you sleep to ensure you wake up to
a younger looking fresher and firmer
complexion this one I will be completely
honest it stings like
when you put this on your face if you've
got super sensitive skin I don't really
know if your sir you should use this
because honestly like I don't have I
don't have super sensitive skin like my
skin can be sensitive sometimes but most
time it's fine there's really things my
face so if you have sensitive skin I
probably would stay away from this to be
honest or get advice if you should use
it I don't know if you should use it or
not like I'm just saying these things I
 so yeah this one is so good I just
apply it all over my skin and I woke up
in the morning and wash it off and my
skin just has an extra glow it just
feels so much better like literally just
recharge like it feels so good okay so
next I'm gonna tie in my skin because I
have two different toners here this well
I only bought this when I got this from
Eminem's the other week I picked up this
as well because I'd seen I think I love
sarahi on YouTube she goes on about this
product she loves it so I want you to
try it this is the pixie glow tonic
it's an exfoliating toner I'm not gonna
use just once a day because it is an
exfoliating toner so it's gonna get rid
of any dead skin cells and stuff like
that and I are you explaining it last
night so I'm not gonna use it now but um
he says gently exfoliates to remove dead
skin cells green and healthy glowing
skin for all skin types like I said I
really do just like a couple of times
that's another one that I will keep you
updated with that I'm going to use it
more and just see what my skin reacts to
it like but a visa comes I really like
it so I will keep you updated on that
one okay so forth toner I am gonna use
this enemies Steven apricot toner I love
this promise so much this one that I go
to all the time I already went through a
whole bottle of this and I've got a new
one don't ever really find tone as I
like but this one I just love the smell
of and it feels really like nice on the
skin and I will say something rooms like
these it's like a cooling spray as well
I can spritz it over my face sometimes
we don't put my makeup on just to give
me any bit of hydration I like that as
well
and so what I have to do is take a
cotton wool pad into this spray is on
there I'm just gonna wipe Y it over my
face they're not I'm just feels really
good as well on the skin and then also
after was that I should just give it a
little spritz on the faces up
it's just so good I give myself sort of
like two days - three days a week we
don't wear any makeup just because I
just think it's really important to let
my skin breathe okay so after that I
have these are something that I attend
to do I even moisturize going use an oil
so today I am gonna use an oil I'm just
going to leave on my skin to soak in
once again throughout the rest of the
day so I was two different oils here
this was elements this is the
pro-collagen marine oil and this is an
anti-wrinkle face of I know it sounds
crazy and wrinkled because I'm only 23 I
don't have wrinkles the anti aging which
means you have to use them when you're
younger like I think that's what a lot
of people get confused with antiaging
means this preventing you from aging so
if you use them when you've already aged
you can't go backwards so use anti-aging
products from young keep them in your
skincare routine and then obviously is
going to prevent you from agent so yeah
and it's the aging you use when you're
younger that makes sense that's what I
got told anyway and it doesn't make
sense so yes I got done um so yeah I
like to use this one this one's really
good so this is the anti-aging oh it
says massage three to four drops over
the face and neck so yeah that is a
really good oil if you want an
anti-aging oil and then this one is a
really nourishing face when someone
gives me a really really intense glow
like glow to my skin I leave on my skin
so can sometimes if I'm not wear eye
makeup Olli this on all day and I'm
really like give me that extra glow to
my skin or I will use this overnight and
I just love this all so much this is a
pixie Rose oil Bend and I have not had
this long I picked this up when I picked
this up which was from MLS like couple
weeks ago I've been using it every
single day
I've even been using that underneath
their makeup application and it's made
my foundation sit nice it's just such a
nice oil I love this so much so he says
it's got a rickshaws of botanical
extracts and bitumen tinea that helps
protect and strengthen skin for all skin
types
massage two or three drops on to cleanse
tone skin extra hydration
in below and one or two drops two
moisturizers before apply in so never
actually provide this into more
moisturizer but think that's what I'm
gonna do today up today so I have a body
moisturizer and a face moisturizer the
face moisturizer that I cannot live
about is the Charlotte's he'll bring
magic career this is a little mini pot I
had a big one and then where it's gone
home just picked on my little one have a
little travel size one as well and yeah
I love this so much this moisturizer is
just so worth the price I kind of live
about this moisturizer it's just one
that I go to all the time and I feel
like on my own I could just need a good
moisturizer this one is just yeah so
bomb I love it and then for my body
moisturizer I like to use this which is
the hemp stripping moisturizer this is a
body cream it's really a it says
enriched divine represent pure natural
hemp seed oil
the smell is unreal like they have those
different colors so I think they would
like different smells but this one's my
favorite one and I use this like so much
this moisturizer is just so balm I used
to use it on my face but I just think
the Charlotte Tilbury war might be
better for my face because it's a bit
thicker and a bit like it's just a bit
better for my face and this one is
really good for my body so yeah so I'm
gonna put some that oil in this
moisturizer today so I've never done
that before so I'm just going to put
some of this moisturizer on the back of
my hand just shot it shot it till we're
magic cream then I'm gonna put a few
drops of this oil in which is the pixie
rose or your balance a few drops of that
in
I also think it's really really good as
well if you do have the extra money I
mean we don't always have extra money
but whenever you have some spare money
and some spare time to go like a really
good facial as well try and go facials
as much as I can they can't get
expensive but I found this place near me
actually that does really good facial
about 30 pounds which i think is
actually really good especially because
I've been sparse in London and paid like
ridiculously for facial once how to face
you I was come out and I just feel so
much better like my skin just feels so
good so yeah definitely recommend
investing in sort of just going to get a
photo if it's just once every couple you
know a few months once every few months
just treated South Magnetic Asia so for
eye cream I like to use the ginseng
refresh it I cream to brighten and epub
I don't really have another eye cream I
like this ones like my opposite II to go
to I love this one so I think she just
it's really hard when you have net like
for snares on but I just kind of like
press it under my eye I'm just gonna
apply some this over the lid as well
same one the others unless she's so
hungry
thinking about walking in just press
that in under my eyes gently and rub a
little bit on the top of my lid I think
I can just so important a lot of people
miss out I creams but - the eye creams
will help as well when you don't want
your under eyes decreased when you apply
concealer using eye cream every day it
really helped to hydrate your under-eye
so that is all the products I use and
like I said I'm not like a skin
specialist I don't know like much about
skin it's just what works with me these
are products that I use regularly like I
switch around all the time and products
I think really really worth the money
and just yeah products I think that you
definitely will not be disappointed with
so yeah that is all the products I use I
hope you guys enjoyed this video please
