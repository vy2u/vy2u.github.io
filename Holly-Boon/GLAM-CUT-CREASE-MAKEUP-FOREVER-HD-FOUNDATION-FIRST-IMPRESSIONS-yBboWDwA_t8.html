highly requested video I posted a cut
crease like every glamorous I look on
Instagram and those of you have
requested to see it so here we are and I
am gonna do like a talked through video
because you guys had you read like the
chit chat get ready with me so yeah I've
already primed my eye on my eyebrows I'm
just about to set my eyes with the Laura
Mercier setting powder because I use
concealer I don't it to Chris so just
gonna set that now I've ever I used the
Mac satin powder and I recently just got
the primer see a satin card because
everyone kept running around about and I
was like okay I'm ready I'm just gonna
get it actually you love it so much more
because it just doesn't feel cakey it
just feels nice so it's quite pricey but
I would definitely recommend you trying
it so yeah I'm gonna be taking my Sigma
EA 6 this is my winged eyeliner brush
but I'm gonna use this to apply the
crease color and I'm gonna be using it's
a weaver smoky palette and i'm gonna be
using shade ashes awake which is this
like brown color here okay so what you
want to do is you want to basically
create a line you don't want it to go in
your crease you when you could just
above the crease so you just want to
create look like this I can't walk when
I'm doing this because I'll it up
it doesn't need to be super super neat
because you're gonna render out anyway
at this point so in abusing this fear
space e 25 this is a type of blending
brush and I'm just gonna blend this line
upward so you just want to blend it out
just not so harsh
so yeah you just want to blend it out so
it's just more of a faded line and now
I'm going to go in using the Too Faced
semi-sweet chocolate palette I pretty
much use this palette all the time your
eyes are probably sick of hearing about
it but I'd okay so I'm gonna use the
shade peanut bar everything that you do
now you want to keep it above this line
so I'm just kind of going to go in like
so with this color
okay so then next you want to go in with
a dark brown shade so again I sound like
a broken record but I'm gonna be using
shade truffled from that palette as well
which is like a darker Brown and I'm
gonna be going in with that next
yeah why don't you replied that I'm
gonna take the fear space again this is
the e-40 this is a blending brush again
so I'm just going to blend that out
don't worry about bringing all this
product up here we're gonna clean it all
up anyway I just want to bring it like
flick it out remove the product outwards
rather than you don't want to take it
too far pay you don't obviously want the
color to be like right on up to your
eyebrow so yeah you just want to kind of
put it the color out a little bit just
blend that hidden now I'm gonna be just
applying a base to my eyelid so I'm
gonna be using the Mac Paint Pot in bare
study so I'm just gonna apply this to my
lid up to that line this part you're
gonna be careful to make sure it's knee
I'm going to be using the Too Faced
clutter this came with my Vegas and they
Stardust palette so I'm not sleeping
about a separate but this is a two-faced
nude beam gamma dust somewhat amusing
that it's like an eyesore like champagne
ecole de type color it's very nice it's
first of all I am going to spray on my
brush with mac fix+ I'm going to be
using the mac 242 brush which is
basically the brush which is used to
apply the base I'm just gonna be using
that a lot of you ask me why are you do
my eye makeup first so depends what I
look I'm going for
if I'm going to be using glitter then I
like to do my eye makeup first cuz I
don't glitter to fall out all on my face
makeup so that's basically why sorry I'm
gonna be doing the first impressions on
the Make Up For Ever HD foundation in a
minute because I I ordered it I three
weeks ago I completely forgot and
obviously like Christmas delivery and
stuff forever to come okay that's a lot
I didn't order it like three days ago
just like clasp but no like two weeks
ago
um yeah I'm excited to try it I just
support on ice I've guessed my shade so
I have no idea of my shade is right or
not but we'll see now we're gonna go and
winged eyeliner this is just like the
worst part of me because I'm like this
fuck's up there and it's up my
whole eye makeup I just come on it gives
me anxiety so I'm gonna go back in with
my winged liner brush by Sigma this is
the eo6 brush and my Sigma gel liner I
said what I'm gonna do is I want to kind
of wing my liner out towards this line
here where our affirmed on my cut crease
so I'm just gonna I can talk I do this
so now using my Rimmel London Xtreme
black Volume Mascara
I'm just going to apply this to my
eyelashes before I five cents a false
one I feel like I'm a cup never looks
complete until you've done your face
makeup but as I may remember satin and
then you do your face makeup when you're
like yeah so lashes I'm gonna be using
are gonna sound like a record breaking a
record again so value k long lash and
these am i right or dietitian use either
the time
so
just use when I wait for that to dry so
you can't see all this glue then I'm
just going to go over it with black
liner just to get rid of these white
bits and apply some mascara so I'm just
going to quickly go and do my other eye
off camera and then I'm gonna comment in
my face makeup seeing it a bit so I'm
just quickly probably my face using the
Nivea for men post shave balm I'm just
gonna rub this in until it goes a bit
like sticky
through now it's time to try the Make Up
For Ever HD foundation so I ordered this
online I just completely guessed my
shades so let's hope this actually looks
okay so I got the I think it's called
sand it's the why three one five and
said it see I don't know if you need to
love this or not but I'm just gonna
present this in yeah I felt like you
need a bit like why bear this
chief I think this shade is pretty much
perfect
I think I'm gonna try foundation brushes
I'm not sure how I feel about this bu
Brenda
okay so this is it now on my skin I'm
not sure how I fear by at the moment I
feel like I'm gonna have to use it a few
more times and probably let you guys
know yeah I'm just using the mac studio
finish concealer and NC 20
so I went online to get a beep and uh
because I have like four or five but I
feel like I need to get new ones like
but after the few times have you washing
that my favorite they go funny that I've
cleaned my like so many times down and
then just like get anywhere like Robbie
and stuff so I went to order a Pete
vendor and then I saw the prize 16 power
I don't remember my mom being 16 pounds
maybe it was not you realize but 16
pound for a sponge and you
kidding me so I went into B's and I got
this real technique fun and it's
basically just as good and this one was
like $5.99 I could have believed they so
they want to charge 16 him home for a
Spartan yeah okay with that
so now I'm just going to set that using
my Laura Mercier setting powder and the
same beauty Brenda I just used
okay and again me being a broken record
I'm gonna be used in Anastasia Beverly
Hills contour palette and shade shade
cinnamon arenas together again it's
running now and this brush is a gamble
by face faces to the f40 angled contour
brush so I'm gonna use this took on the
saw okay so I was gonna replace them and
brush but basically my favorite brush
and the only one that I have break so I
went on a night out and I dropped it I
know that made me drop a and your decide
I don't even want to open it it was I
just know it's gonna be broken and it
was broken
so I've reordered and I've ordered one
from Mac as well because someone
recommended come over her name you
coming in on my last video you said to
try the Mac mineralize something so I
ordered it so I'll let you know how I
get on with that and a highlighter I'm
gonna be using is this sleek makeup hire
it comes highlighters right comes in
this gold case I'm gonna be some this
goldish shade here and this is my
favorite drugstore highlighter ever I'm
like literally I use it all the time
actually
I don't even use high-end ones anymore
this fan brush was just a really random
one that I've had it for years
ever since I kind of started doing
makeup still have it
we're gonna go in with the fierce face
again e 20 this is a short shader brush
and I'm just gonna use this to apply my
bottom eye shadow yeah so I'm gonna use
it show you two truffled which is the
dark brown from that set that we used
earlier I'm just going to apply this
under my eye
now I'm going to replace them at bottom

that I'm then going to go in with this
is by Rimmel London and this is the Kate
range and this is number 43 okay and
