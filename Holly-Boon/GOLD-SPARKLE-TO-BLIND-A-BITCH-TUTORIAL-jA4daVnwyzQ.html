some type of glam sparkly makeup look
like always I have no idea what so you
guys know that I have worked in vanity
planet before I'm using this pocket and
also their brush kit and they also just
came out with this um mirror ring light
it's so cool I've seen these before

used to use my friends and it was never

then this really bright is that in as
well and I just think it's so good if
like say because a lot of you always
message me right getting a room light
and ring lights could be really
expensive so I just thought this was
like a really good alternative to a ring
light if you didn't want to spend
hundreds of pounds on a ring light which
I've got running out obviously now I'm
filming but if you just wanna take make
good quality makeup pictures you don't
need to buy a massive ring light you can
literally get it it should let you just
as good but just smaller so they've
given me a discount which is Holly gleam
if you use that a check out you get 50%
off it goes down from 120 dollars to $60
it's for a limited time only I'm not
entirely sure how long so if you want to
get it get it

measure because I'm gonna be using it in
this video so I see I will include this

the mirror you guys gonna get a bath
bomb bomb Dhaka it's gonna start off
with my eyebrows I've gone for a snatch
spray you today because I saw Dez he had
a snatch pony in her blog and I was like
I haven't other snatched ponytail in so
long so I'm all about that life at the
moment I filled in my hairline as well
black eye shadow because I had a
receiving hairline you
anyway okay I'm gonna shock to my
eyebrows and I'm gonna use the UH
nostalgia buy videos brow is not in this
dense shade evany when I do my eyebrows
always have to have like a close up
mirror I can't do my eyebrows from that
distance so always have several close up
mirror and this analyzing over here's
one is so sick hello okay I'm just going
to take the Anasazi of Beverly Hills
brow gel and just brush my heads up up
up I'm sorry just kind of use the
maybelline fitme concealer I'm just
going to apply some mister my lids
because I'm just going to set my eyes
using the laura mercier translucent
powder pal nut and this is the Sigma
fake precision brush have a discount
code Hollywood there if you want to get
anything I find it so funny how I'm
Americans say coupon code I had a coupon
a key part okay I kind of do it American
accent unlimited right what do I want to
do with my eyes guys and what do I want
to do what I want to do I really want to
use his peaches and cream palette if any
of you guys have heard of these are from
Liverpool they have an Instagram page
and their stuff is bomb they saw that
I'd use their lip gloss so they message
me on Instagram so would love to send
you some products and I've got something
today I'm so excited to use and they
look so good I love the packaging as
well how cute is that these colors are
really nice take the news and then I'm
going to use they're good at our because
they do the best glitter okay so for my
transition color I'm going to take
makeup geek Peach Smoothie then take
this brush from backstage brushes
they're really good these much as I love
them this is just the large eye blender
brush
so I'm going to take pictures in Korean
palette now and I think I'm going to
take this brownish shade right here the
brush I'm using is the Sigma tapered
blending brush I'm just going to apply
this shade in the crease
how are you choose the worst brush
there's actually yeah holy why the fuck
did I pick knowledge
okay so I'm going to use this locks
petite crease brush by the Weaver
okay I think I'm going to take cocoa
bear by makeup geek and apply some of
this as well
I'm just going to take this pencil brush
by fierce face I'm going to take the
black from the peaches and cream palette
and I'm just going to apply this to the
outer corner of my eye just to darken it
up and you're just going to bring that
in to about halfway in the Cree
okay so before I do the glitter I'm
going to wing my liner and just because
I preferred it to do it this way because
when I try and use gel liner on to blur
it goes really clumpy so I'm going to
hit the Sigma gel liner in wicked and
the er6 when going to brush my seeking
light as well
okay so chain for mine the glitter we
use is called wish it's more of a gold
because I definitely want to go for a
gold so I'm just going to apply the
articles metics glitter glue first of
all to my lender look at this
to be honest there was no need for all
of that black eyeshadow now because I've
covered it with glitter I wasn't going
to put the glitter all the way across
but I just felt like it you know
okay so whilst I wait for my lashes to
dry I'm going to start on my face and
for primer I'm going to take the Nivea
for men post shave balm and I've gone
back to using this I really really like
it haven't used it in such a long time
and I just was in Boots over there and I
was like why did I ever stop using that
so for foundation I'm going to take the
Mac Studio Fix fluid in NC 35 this
foundation is just one that I always go
back to I've stopped using the back of
my coverage cream because broke me out
like really bad and I loved it apart
from that it's gonna apply this with my
Beauty Blender
you
so for consider I'm going to hit the
Maybelline age rewind age rewind okay so
I ripped that it was sponge off and I'm
just going to apply this concealer with
this foundation brush she looks you so
much better way of applying it because
that's it was spongy thing that they put
on it is really actually disgusting
you
okay so I'm just going to set that using
the laura mercier translucent setting
powder
I'm going to take my Mac medium plush
Studio Fix perfecting powder just to set
the rest of my face I'm just going to
take the back give me Sun and this big
round brush from view well sure that's a
say okay I'm going to take my makeup
geek half-hearted pan which is here to
contour and this Mac um small little
stiffer brush
I'm just taking some that contour shade
on this big brush my forehead because
when I use this little stiffer brush
with my forehead it kind of is harder to
blend then taking my zoeva a powder
brush I'm just going to apply some blush
and rinse it this peachy shade here by
makeup geek which is called infatuation
infatuation so I'm just going to finish
with my eyes real quick
so what I'm going to do is take my and
luxe petite crease brush by Zoe Weaver
and take the shade cocoa butter and I'm
just going to literally run this and
move my eyes then I'm going to apply
some of that glitter in the middle and
let's you the middle of my eye here when
I apply some nice glitter glue under my
eye here
do not get this on your in your eye by
the way it stings so bad and taking that
glitter on it she's gonna fight in the
center my
okay next I'm just going to take my
Sigma gel liner on my wing kind of brush
and just apply some of this in the
waterline
okay so now for highlight my favorite
part of the whole entire makeover or is
it getting so excited to more highlight
so today I'm going to use this sleek
highlight palette I'm going to take this
gold shade right here I'm just going to
spray the brush with some fix+ and also
my face quick this highlight is so good
if you're looking for a good like
inexpensive highlighter then this is the
one for you
just in our place that highlight is the
inner corner of my eye and also my brow
bone
so for my lips I'm going to take the
Mack spice lip liner first of all then
