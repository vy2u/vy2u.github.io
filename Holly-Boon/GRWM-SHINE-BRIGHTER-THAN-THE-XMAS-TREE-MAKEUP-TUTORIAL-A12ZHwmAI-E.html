name is Holly pinafore new hair hello so
today I'm gonna be filming to get ready
with me I am actually off out for some
Christmas dinner with a few friends so I
thought I'd feel myself getting ready
yeah I don't know what I want to do
something with blue obviously a sparkle
it's Christmas time why not I'm gonna
just comb some of the anasazi Beverly
Hills brow gel through my brows I really
did put a little bit on buzz little bit
more when he's my Mac prep and private
fix class just to hydrate my skin a
little bit and I did just apply some of
the Urban Decay lip love sheer butter
coconut oil moisturizing lip prep that's
what I'm named right for my brows I'm
going to use my la go shade slim brow
pencil in the shade blackest Brown
recently started using this I really
like it so recently my eyebrows like one
eyebrow raised more than the other so
I've had to like pluck the other one
thinner too much the one that doesn't
grow they were still not as much what I
mean who has here has perfect brows
actually some people do I'm jealous but
not me I'm sorry my lighting is off I've
had a bit of an issue so as you guys
probably know I've said this a couple of
times I smashed my a few of my light
light bulbs my lighting setup just fell
over and smashed because I have I work
in quite a small space so it's really
hard to get around things sometimes and
I caught like wires and smashed them and
yeah and then it ordered some more but I
thought that they'd come because I've
got this big Amazon box and I was like
oh that must be it
and it hasn't come yet and I'm just like
where is it what did it sound like a
home so I'm going to cover up my brows
and will use my instant the arrays our
eye concealer from Maybelline in the
shade nude I'm running out of this I
need to get another one
and when he's my mac 242 brush
so I'm going to bring this all over the
lid and then I'm gonna go over it with
my sponge I'm going to set my lids I'm
using my Beauty bakery translucent
powder so i'm going to use my morphe 39a
palette I'm just going to use this shade
first of all but yeah basically this
weekend I booked a hotel for me and Todd
just so that we could get away really
it's like pulling a spire and stuff
which would be nice so I still need to
pack for that fast get ready if this is
where I'm wrong today I already filmed a
video and I went to edit it and it was
great again I don't understand white
keeps doing that
so footage was great I was like oh god
like I need to quickly do something else
and I was like I'm gonna have to just
film a get ready with me because I need
to get ready yeah excited to get away
for the week over tired I just I just
what I can eat to get away for a few
days you don't mean so I'm gonna go for
this shade right here's orange color and
a different fluffy brush apply that in
the crease
I just zoomed you in a bit so you can
see exactly what to him but you break it
out and I thought it was because of the
biotin if you guys follow me on snapchat
I've been taking buyers him because I
want my hair to grow quicker and I start
breaking out and I was like oh my god
must because of the biotin so I stopped
taking the biotin and I was still
breaking out like here and everything
and I don't ever get spots here I may
see just get them here when I'm like do
on or like hair but never not on my
cheeks and stuff so I was like what the
hell is going on then some a couple of
people told me that the Fendi Beauty
foundati it was breaking them out and I
was like oh my god what if it's that cuz
I've been using it so much because I
love that foundation I was using it so
much I was like I'm gonna stop using and
see if it's that and I'm localizes I've
stopped using it my skin starts clear up
I had a few here they've gone these ones
have gone down that ones went down these
ones have pretty much gone now
and then I've just got a couple here but
I always get them here and we got since
use not using that foundation so it
really must be that foundation that's
been breaking me out and I'm like so
annoyed because I love that foundation
but I always like really really like
cleanse my skin every night and wash my
skin so much to make sure I get
everything off my face so it must be the
foundation because of me right
like sleeping on a couple anything like
that like I always take out my skin so
the foundation played me
I'm selling my dunks it is so good
especially felt really scared that
foundation is this but no it's not
because it breaks you out I really go
back to my hourglass foundation if
you've been fond of me for a while
you're not eat a lot of that foundation
but it's just so expensive I can ran out
and I was like do I repurchase it I have
so many foundations I was like I want to
buy donut at same time and where take
this color next oh this color is nice so
I'm gonna bring this all the way in the
inner corner you go from a halo II kind
of eye
and I'd like glitter in the middle I'm
trying to get back into like eating
healthy and working out and I mean I've
been doing it for like two days spider
at home that's gonna last I actually
been doing quite a few home workouts and
Tammy amber and her YouTube channel
she's got a at home booty workout and a
few other home workouts I'd really
recommend her I think they're so good i
watch them whenever i want to do a home
workout I wish this follow has I'm not
going to use this dark purple shade so
I'm just going to apply this in the
outer corner and the inner corner darken
up a little bit
it's so annoying when one eye one eye
goes better than the other I like that
just winds me up definitely think that
eye looks but in the eye but it's
alright so I'm gonna take some concealer
brush I'm just - four - brush and I'm
gonna just carve out
so I'm not gonna worry about blending
the edges of the concealer because I'm
gonna apply to that art and then I'll
blend so I'm gonna use my steel our
magnificent metals glitter and below
liquid eyeshadow in the shade get in
karma which is a rose gold look so well
I'm gonna put it on top
okay so it's gonna leave that to dry for
a second or whatever on the edges so we
stared homage to just be like a straight
line none really
I'm gonna take that dark purple shade at
the edge
don't you know I actually really like
that I'm going to do luscious bottom
when I first of all just line my
lashline with some black shadow so I'm
going to use my 8006 we're going to
brush from Sigma and I was gonna take
the black eyeshadow palette I'm just
going to apply some to my lashline

I'm just leaving my lashes to dry for a
minute I'm using my Koko lashes and
start armoire which I always use what's
new so I'm gonna do my under eye so I'm
gonna just prize honey bit of concealer
and then using my Beauty render foot
creams have one for powder one for
creams you just press that in I'm gonna
go transition color then the orange then
the burgundy car than the dark burgundy

so I'm going to use that orange color do
the same thing going for the reddish

fluid and this in the shade NC 42 which
is a bit too dark because I had this
shade when I was tanned from holiday and
