so in today's video i thought i would do
it get ready with me cuz i am actually
going to a concert tonight so I thought
why not just get rid of you all so when
I do my hair as well in this video I did
just put my eyebrows they look really
red underneath yes I asked you guys to
ask me some questions and I would say
for new here hello hi welcome and piece
of sky yeah I've got some questions I'm
gonna answer as well while I get ready I
don't know how this is gonna work so I'm
really kind of nervous but yeah we're
just home some browser through my brows
I do feel like my Primark brow jaw but I
can't find it okay so the first question
is who are your inspirations oh I have
so many people that I look up to like
especially in on YouTube like I love
youtubers yeah it's hard if I have so
many people that I look up to I'm just
going to use my skinny brow pencil from
Primark in the shade dark brown this is
yep Doc Brown I love watching Shaunie
Ramon is one of my absolute favorites I
love her I also love Mike Finch and I
love I just go through phases but
they're the two people that I always
watch about them but always watch my
videos matte lips or glossy lips and
definitely gloss lately I do still love
a matte lip though like I'll always have
a matte lip but gloss for me is saying
right now wait did I tell you that I
faked and if you think I like dark phase
cuz I've faked and I haven't picked Anne
in the longest time I'm going to see
August tonight in Birmingham because I
love his music would you ever get any
tattoos you know what I have nearly so
many times I really think they look so
cute and nice sometimes but I just don't
know what to get this is the problem I'm
the most indecisive person in the whole
entire world you probably noticed I
change my mind like literally over the
time I think she picked up so many of
these concealers from maker preparation
straight c-5 I've got like three just in
front of me now
I don't know that's hand I like to use
for my shadow base as well it's a good
full coverage you know it's really good
with shadows so yeah I'm just so in
decided see if I just don't know what to
get always change my mind
and I always think I'm looking to
everyone and cuz you look really cool
and the same time right foot I don't
want to at the same time but then I see
people with tattoos nothing get excited
like Todd's gotta sign retailers and
obsessed I love it talking in your
makeup at the same time is actually
difficult this brush by the way is my
Sigma e55 I'm gonna just set my lids its
heinie they're not too much just a
little too any bit so it makes it easier
for shadows to blend why does it keep
 doing that so reason might be
bakery translucent powder just upon the
tiniest little bit so if I so many of
you asking me to use my Jack and Hill
palette more videos so I'm going to use
it today
we're gonna do like a soft brown pull
matte look um okay so I'm gonna take
this shade right here for my transition
color and I'm using my NYX 17 bra I'm
just gonna apply this just above my
crease what's your favorite song at the
minute I have to say Tinashe it's nice
no shadow no her name is he's good drama
do you ever find it hard to be 100%
honest about products because you have a
biased opinion on the brand never liked
another so I'm just gonna use this shade
I'll do YouTube forever seeing myself
and for you guys so I mean I didn't do
it for brands so yeah I read okay I will
just so you say ours I will let you know
what then I'm just going to put this in
the crease and bring it all the way in
using my Sigma e30 8 brush you think
we're Sigma brushes as they are
expensive but they last you so long I've
had the same brushes since I started you
know Jo and I was like two and half
years ago and they're still fine and
I've washed them
millions of times so yeah they are like
a investment I would say but they just
last you forever what made you want to
start a YouTube channel and was it easy
or hard to get situation well now I
started YouTube because people come an
emergency but I'm like oh can you can
you start you to you because they used
to pose makeup looks and stuff and then
I just started and that was it really I
used to like I said just work full-time
and then like the weekends just dedicate
when I do it and he really just became
so passionate about it and I loved it so
much I mean when I hit my first like ten
thousand subscribers and I was like
crying and like oh my god well let's
just say it was crazy and then I just
like I would practice all the time I
remember I would literally get him from
work and I've worked like a full day and
then I'd come home and I play around
with makeup until like early hours of
the morning just practicing and
practicing practicing I'm just gonna use
this dark shade here for the outer
corner but yeah I just think whatever
you do you need to be passionate about
it and not think you know a lot of
people who said I wanted you to because
I want the trips and the free makeup and
all that kind of and it's not the
right way to go about it it's not that's
not going to bring any happiness at all
trust me it's not what about that I
couldn't care if I didn't ever got PR
package again library can can us PR to
me is like it's obviously help is
helpful for me because I don't have to
go out and buy the product but at the
same time it's not gonna be all and end
all for me it's not what I can it's not
why I did this do you not I mean so just
make sure whatever you go into your
going into it for the right reasons and
not for the wrong reasons when you think
oh my god it's not gonna work out I
didn't want to do my life it took me
years to figure out what way to do it
what I was gonna do honestly I was back
and forth and so many things I went to
dance college I was auditioning for
shows I then quit that to be in a band
and the band didn't work out and I was
like what we're gonna do now and there's
damage in this so it's like it's all
trial and error with things I think
because sometimes you think you want to
do things and then you know you do it
for a little bit you know I actually I
don't think this is for me and that's
fine you've got all the time in the
world to decide what you want to do
honestly there's no rush there's no age
limit people tend to put Asia mitts on
things like all you needs have a house
at this age and you need to
this you know success what they say and
it's like no you don't you don't there's
no age limit you just find your purpose
when you find your purpose you know I
mean it's gonna use my revelation
concealer I'm gonna cut it cut half my
crease oh so there's little step lock on
by the way is secondly all play see bits
I could forge on the set and it's so
cute I'm not obsessed I've got it from
pretty little thing so computer sat on
my foot
I'm gonna get pins you do what we're
doing okay I can't talk what I do that
so well so how'd you get them even so I
wouldn't you stuck up pure white shade
I'm gonna put over top of this concealer
just a matte white shade and the jack
and he'll but I doesn't have a map why
it's got like a shimmer white which I
don't want so I'm gonna take my
revolution palette and i'm gonna use
this shade right here this is their
reloaded neutrals to palette and i'm
gonna miss brushes from primark i'm just
going to take this big end and put this
well on top would you recommend skincare
for oily skin I seen your snap about the
blackhead trim and I had the exact same
one worm cap where I maybe that's a sign
of something oh my god right I had the
weirdest dream just real quick I had the
weirdest dream last night and you only
wake up in and you forget and then you
just comes back to you I just remembered
I was like oh my god basically I am in
my dream I had like a black head no in
the mirror it's a going like that puppy
I get rid of it and I went to squeeze in
a black worm came out and I was crying
oh my god
I've got worm in my face I it was
 wait and I seen the weirdest
dream I've ever had and I completely
forgot about when I first woke up and
then it came back to me and I was like
I'm on a walk probably bad weird weird
weird word I know it's not supposed to
be a sign for saying can anyone let me
know I'm okay so I'm gonna mix these two
shares I really don't know too much
about skincare like I know it works to
me in regards like if I have a breakout
I like to use the glam glow that mud
mask that
just clears up my skin so well I also
use this Mario Badescu like scrub scrub
which is good for my really good for my
skin I don't know too much about it so
I'm pretty not the best person to ask
okay so I'm gonna do a wing so I'm
definitely not gonna talk while I do
this after that she hold my
breath to do this cuz I was messing up
I'm gonna use my Maybelline lasting
drama jaw liner in the shape black and
my so we bought winged liner brush and
only use this for my brows when you use
like Palmes and stuff but i started
using it for my liner again and it's so
really good i felt if you're pomades a
lot your gels dry up just to scoop some
up put in the back of your hand and like
the warmth from your skin will kind of
like warm up the product and marry a
little bit it's as easy as use okay so
from my eye I have to do quite a
straight wing you could fold have a fold
of skin right there so if I go if I try
and bring my liner underneath so it goes
like that it just when I open my eyes
and look straight when it can look
straight when I've mine doesn't extrude
so I have to go quite straight with my
liner I'm gonna take some black
eyeshadow from that Jaclyn hill palette
and I'm gonna press it on top of the
liner this makes it extra black like
this makes it go so dark and it
obviously sets is what I was thinking
doesn't transfer cuz I don't if you've
ever notice i specially if you up or any
eyelids and you'll get transferred like
bright glowing up here and it's the rice
and annoying thing in the world so
you're setting it with eyeshadow is one
trick to stop that okay so I'm gonna
quickly do my other eye off camera
because I feel like it just takes the
longest just take so long and I can't
talk what I do it anyway so I'll be back
in literally half an hour for me in like
two seconds for you okay so I'm back and
I'm just gonna apply some mascara to my
lashes and it should fill out when I do
winged liner I just always gets thicker
into my lot more so maybe I should just
like tweak that a little bit and then
you know I just it up and then I'm
stuck in or I just get so thick and I
was over it there's gonna take a wipe
and clean and my lashes I actually just
home when I was like this and just
why I'm in weight makeup why he needs to
make sure the makeup wife is really wet
like these make a website use a really
moisturizing so they'll really wet
because if they're dry you end up
getting the fluff it gets stuck and then
you get all the fluff stuck in your
lashes and it's just a nightmare so
where is the glue
okay so I'm gonna apply some glue to the
lashes I'm using the house of brushes
eyelash glue which is my absolute fave
so when I let my lashes dry and we're
gonna start on the face so I'm gonna
take some my glam glow mat glow
moisturizer apply some of this I love
this stuff so much and it smell was just
amazing good I'm gonna apply some of
this blur primer from primark in the
center of my face cuz this to me doesn't
minimize my pores really like it I'm
just gonna apply that here retakes on my
Beauty bakery translucent powder red it
my big it cause my crushing it tap off
the excess I'm just gonna have enough I
don't apply too much if you do too much
it can make your makeup look a bit cakey
okay so for foundation I'm gonna use the
Too Faced Born This Way Foundation in
the shade golden this is the only thing
that's going to match mean it right now
because I did fake tan and I fake time
to my face so so this is the only thing
I have just going to match me yeah my
maybe 24 hours day one is it would to
like hold up in love you like I love you
so I'm just redoing my eyelashes because
where I tapped off the excess powder off
that brush it went and why I know she so
has to wipe them clean so I've just
really like put glue on them so let them
dry down for a sec I'm just going to I
can see it on so we're going to use
their makeup revolution concealer into
finance trade c5
my absolute fave illiterate I haven't
not touched another concealer since I
bought this honestly so when I take my
sponge
this is dump and I'm gonna bring my
concealer in this concealer is so light
because obviously I've just made eyes
they use a more tanned foundation so
obviously if you've seen it's gonna look
way lighter but oh well
so for cream bronzer I'm gonna take my I
couldn't run in pigments taking the
shade 3.1 I do sometimes use 4.1 but I
think it's a bit too dark so I'm gonna
use this one instead I'm just going to
apply this how I would like with contour
I'm just gonna stick my lashes on real
quick these are the cocoa ones look okay
so the glue isn't completely dry yet so
I'm just gonna let them dry I'm gonna
answer some more questions sorry I'm so
bad it won't meet asking like I said are
you guys do a meet-up this year love you
love you too and I really do want to
make sure that I do one this year I
always say when I do and why just don't

throat you guys my friends it's really

like you just get start talking about
like made car I'm getting this all in my
hair it's got every brother and then I'm
going to set my under eye I'm gonna use
my feet your bakery translucent powder
and a different sponge this sponge is a
little bit damp as well I find it just
applies a power dive but a bit easier
you don't it like wet though cuz I'll
just be a mess okay back to the
questions for a come on favourite

I'm standing in here that long but any
cry for the people he'll know so I'm
gonna just finish with the under eye dis
the same shades I use on top what are
your goals for 2018 personal growth and
career wise love you happy to and goals
do you know what I really don't think I
have anything I accept goals
I just want to continue what I'm doing
and just see where it takes me and I've
had just taken opportunities as they
come or just seeing what happens look I
don't have anything set in my mind I
would like to have a house as I said
earlier I would like to be able to have
a house by the end of the year but that
just depends on obviously work
opportunities or how much I save but
yeah I would like to be in my own house
for Christmas at the end of the year
that's what I would love that will just
be amazing and just to be as happy as
possible really I just I need to stop
doing so much for people that's the
thing I need to start doing I do a lot
for people that I care about anyone that
I care about will tell you I do so much
for them and I love doing stuff to
people like I love helping people I love
just doing anything I can to help people
I care about
yeah I do dude sometimes too much for
people when its own yeah if you were
shining on an island what's the one
makeup product you would take with you
my highlight liquid highlight liquid
highlight
one product Oh one makeup product that's
really hard I feel like my eyebrows are
quite good on their own I mean if I dyed
them before I went I feel like it would
be fine so don't feel like I need a brow
product yeah I think it could good I all
I can waste your uh wet moisture eyes is
on makeup alright but no it's so hard
okay I really call it that question and
chances are we're not gonna be standing
on the I never wore makeup or not so
yeah it's like deeply it's not that the
it's not as serious you haven't really
have to think about it because we put it
not gonna happen but you know best
extensions love you girl detail and the
best extensions sorry I'm just using the
Marc Jacobs pencil in the shade brownie
this is the only like really chocolatey
brown eyeliner that I have and I love it
makes my brown eyes pop so that's why
I'm using that best extensions so I go
to vixen brush and I've never ever ever
had any extensions better than this and
I promise you I've tried every single
hair extensions you can ever imagine
because rush dude you clip ins no but
you have to go in and they match your
hair perfect like I cannot explain I go
in there I get micro bonds and the way
they apply the micro bonds is the
craziest thing I like I've never had it
before I used to get pre bonded and
white coupons is different thing is this
really good Caracara teen glue for your
hair so doesn't damage your hair at all
he's like Russian hair that they use
they kind of cut the hair and then they
like twist it and they put like some
glue on it and then they do it in your
hair but it's like the best glue ever
it's not I don't know what it is but
obviously it's keratin globe is like a
really really good one so it doesn't
damage your hair at all
I feel like the hair is just amazing I
can buy it like hundreds and hundreds of
millions of times it just does not ever
get damaged when I need to get them out
it's because they've grown out rather
than the hairs bad I feel like the hair
I could just like keep going from
 night years and it'd still be
good but yeah if you don't want to get
permanent extensions they do do clip ins
and I really do recommend them or I just
say they're amazing and I supposed to
buy them until I do
my hair but yeah I just loved it
honestly okay why did this is happened
I've put mascara on and that's all under
my eye oh my god
I see people tuning for spooty but I
mean that's really not working oh okay I
thought you have to wait for it to dry
first and then do that my bad so when it
takes on my Mac dark deep mineralized
skinfinish I'm just going to go over
that cream bronzer that I put on so I'm
what they can't you use and also what's
your favorite Mac lift me so my favorite
fake tan is love intern an ultra dark I
love it it's one that's like the deluxe
the mousse and I can't mine enough I
love that and it's the only tight other
years if you've followed me for years
you'll know I've literally used it for
years I've used it since day one
I'm and favorite Mac if you know what I
don't many where I'm at lipsticks I'm
not really that into them I think that
over price and just don't even like
don't know they're okay I've like NYX
ones or yeah NYX NYX lingerie liquid
lipsticks I'm one of my favorites I also
love their Nick's glass I just say NYX
is not my favorite full lips definitely
so lips I'm going to use my morphe lip
line in the show caviar caviar darling
you
you motivate yourself to work hard every
day you know what I feel like I never
feel like I'm working because it's
something I'm so passionate about I love
so much I could get so excited to film
videos and so excited to do makeup looks
for Instagram and well that kind of
stuff it's like the fact that is
actually my career is just a bonus to me
I love it so much
and I I could win the lottery tomorrow
and I would still do YouTube I don't do
it for money like I do YouTube because I
 love it literally if I yeah like
I said if I if I initially wanted a very
tomorrow first of all I mean I'm my
subscribers I'm gonna have a lip
party and second of all I'm still gonna
do it you this is what I this is when
you truly know if you're passionate
about something is if the money wasn't
in the picture so if the money wasn't in
the picture would you still be doing it
us we need to ask yourself and if the
answer is yes that means you love what
you do feel like I should stop talking
while I'm trying to Milo because this is
going everywhere so I'm gonna use my NYX
lingerie matte lip stick in the shade so
not sorry these are their these are
different ones he's a Matt Matt Matt
something lit lingerie wait what the
 is this not a little lipstick bitch
way oh my god this is for your eyes I've
been uses on my lips like what was a
liquid lipstick it's a lid lingerie I'm
so going to use on my it's like it I've
been wearing when it was forever so I
ain't about stop now it's in the shade
24 you know obvious even when someone
lives oh well if you're say for your
eyes is take your lips I think this is
really your eyelids cuz it's got an eye
logo on it and it says lid lingerie so
I'm guessing it's fielitz you smell bad
what your goes for this year and how do
you stay motivated to achieve them
January it's got me struggling nothing
let me to and yeah January is a struggle
because obviously everyone's like after
Christmas just feels like oh and it's
like back to work
like money and it's like oh do not need
I think since I have been working for
myself and this is not my career I I
I don't know like when I used to work
normally but I uh I better work and
generate so and Ikes I hated my job but
um since I've done this I don't know why
I don't I find it easy to stay motivated
because I love it I don't ever not want
to do it so it's not a case of like
trying to make myself you know I mean
and anyway I was using this makeup
academy is loose highlighter that I
tried in that video I actually really
loved it look how thick that is
I'm sorry but like this highlight is I'm
going to use my am prymaat glass which I
want to sucess we're gonna wear it all
the time and this is the perfect shine
gloss in the shade stay in peachy and
what if it is on top yes I'm gonna use
this morphe set in midst everyone goes
on about this all the big youtubers so I
wanted to see what the fuss was
about
so I bought it the other day I do think
it applies a lot nicer than one that
sprays because it goes on a bit more
thin and even well I don't know about
sit and makeup because I used it for
like all day that make sense so yeah for
my hair I think what did you like a wave
wavy look I don't really know the hair
dress is my hair up fix and blush when
she put extensions in she had a wave and
it was so sick quite quick I'm
not gonna be able to do that I feel like
I'm so bad at hammer we're not going to
do it I'm gonna try can we just not talk
about this fluff front of my hair B's
because I thought it would be a good
idea to change my hairline I know why
would you ever think that's a good idea
but you know and I was in a rush to go
out and I was like oh my god like I hate
this bit here so I just shaved it and
then yeah don't wait for it to grow back
and I'm tempted to just shave it again
because it's really annoying I'm the
worst person of hair so just yeah if I'm
doing this all wrong I'm sorry your
hairdresser and you're just like water
you do
I'm just gonna put some serum in my hair
I used this catwalk blow out bomb I've
used it for years and it's the only
thing that makes my hair really shiny
about it getting greasy I've got three
like seven or eight bowls of this
honestly some of its missing my hands
yes the only thing that gives me really
shiny hair without it making it greasy
right I'm just gonna go straight and
seven minutes I'm gonna straighten these
bits hair because I do want it wavy but
I also want it flat to my head as well
so now it's just going up and strain at
first I really should put a heat
protecting my hair but I don't have one
so that's up oh my god Jimmy he protects
my hair yeah no sir I don't have one
this is what the hairdresser did someone
to try it
she basically got a bit of hair and then
she put it in the straighter she counted
this and she got pushed it one way and
then pushed it the other way it's so
hard to sharpen my black hair camera um
so she just kept pushing the hair in my
different directions three straight none
just Hampton straightener she kind of
showed me how she did it and it gives
you a waves without it but giving you
puffy hair shove it so it gives you oh
my god you can't even see I felt like
expire anyway this is gonna take me ages
I just know and I'm gonna hate it it's
working
yes I like to have a bit of bike texture
to the hair but I don't like it to go
outwards do you know what I mean I don't
it to be puffy eye so I'm not gonna curl
my hair it sticks outwards rather than
like just giving me a bit of texture so
I like the fact that you can do this and
just get a bit of a wave I don't want to
do it like in sections either I want it
to look a bit messy so I'm just grabbing
bits of hair you just don't want to do
like thin bits of hair as well you know
when you go half way through night do I
actually want wavy hair or just finish
the others
my health camera and I just sprayed some
hairspray I like to use this one it's
the silhouette hairspray from one way
we're gonna say it not even gonna say it
can pronounce it not going by yourself
also I did just add some black and the
long line instead and smoked out a tiny
bit some weight to make it a little bit
more evening he oh yeah
so that is to finish her and makeup look
I hope you guys and you look at Ronnie
