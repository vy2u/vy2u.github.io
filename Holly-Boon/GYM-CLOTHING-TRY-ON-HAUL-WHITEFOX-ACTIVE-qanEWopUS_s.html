youtube channel so today I am doing a
I've teamed up a white box boutique and
I'm gonna bring you a closing Jim Hall
I've said that committee backwards Jim
clothing home Holly
hmm so I really get back to go into the
gym regularly
I still go on and off I don't go solidly
so yeah I'm hoping that having this gym
where it's not gonna motivate me to go
back to the gym ash you're going tonight
I'm already on it so the first set I
tried on is this red set which I love I
love the fact that these are high
waisted I love high waisted gym leggings
I really don't like the ones that come
like below the belly button
I like to have them really high waisted
I just think it's way more flattering
and they're just it's way more
comfortable as well so it has this thick
found at the top which is quite stretchy
which is really really good and then
down one side of the leg it's got white
fox active so WFA and then some lines
which agree cute I like the red and
black I think it's really nice and yet
on the back it's got white fox active
and it's got a little sip as well like
this and I suppose you could put things
in there if you've got a small iPhone
you could see your iPhone in there but
I've got the iPhone plus so my fate fit
in there because I like to use wireless
headphones when I'm in the gym Bluetooth
like big ones because they lit ones
never stay in my ears that when I'm
running or if I'm doing something like
they just don't say my ears so I prefer
to have wireless so that would be ideal
and put my phone in there but I mean my
finding out of it but if you've got
little life and I'm sure it'll fit stay
still egg ins and then the top is really
really supportive which I love because
even though I find a boob job
my boobs move like normal boobs and not
like stuck on or anything like some
people think they move around just like
normal boobs and it's hurt so I need
something very supportive
he's inside small and it's got
adjustable straps which is good so if
you want to adjust its height it's also
got padding in there as well which i
think is nice in case i mean you don't
wan your nipple poking for you do yeah
so the padding just helps with that
which i think is good and on the back
it's got white fox active which i love
is working city key but yeah like how
it's red and black i'm pretty good away
it's fun tonight immense tombs and I
like I said so I'm gonna listen tonight
so I realize it's my favorite out of all
of them is this
burgundy color which is so nice I love
it and the top has got the same thing
it's got padding in it which is good and
these straps are adjustable but it's got
this bit down the back which looks like
it's just that kind of shape this is it
in a size small and yeah it's got
whitefox active on the front and then
the leggings are the same they're
high-waisted which is good and then they
reach like they're quite stretchy as
well which is nice and then again on the
back it's got this little zip detail as
well so you can put things in there like
cog here whatever you want to put in
there and it's got white fox active
again on the back but yeah the burgundy
is really cute as well next one is one
of my favorites as well I really love
this color so it's this nudey pink shade
which again is high waisted
and then down both sides it's got white
fox white fox why for what if I was
white fox white box
why fall way down the side and then
again on the backs got the same thing
with the zip and the white fox active
underneath and yeah this has got white
fox white box white box white box down
both sides and then the top is really
cute as well then these straps again
they're not adjustable but this is
really really tight bottoms are also in
a size small everything is in a size
small in this video yeah I love this one
as well this is another one of my
favorite so the red one and this one is
definitely my favorite sets Oh
everything so next one we've got these
new dish leggings again which is what
white folks white folks what I'm gonna
start saying those really around the
band the top band like a black band
these don't have that thick high waist a
bit but they still do fit high waisted
and again they are very stretchy again
these are in a size small is very tight
again this is small and has padding in
it as well like all of them okay also
with those leggings they do this long
sleeved whitefox top as well which I
really like too if you want to sweat
more if you want a long sleeve or
whatever you want and this is perfect
and again it's just got the white band
at the bottom which is stretchy so yeah
you've got the long sleeve top and the
sports bra that goes to the leg ends my
next video I know we just wear like a
sports bra with the leggings and then I
just try a hoodie on over the top for
like when I go there cuz outside is
breathe in and then
when I get in the gym when I sweat I
just take it off and I've just got a
sports Brannigan's which I'm comfortable
with but if you're not comfortable with
that you can always just chuck a t-shirt
over the top and then this last set is
really really cute I love this as well
this is like a it's kind of like a black
and white snakeskin print and so the top
is very tight okay this this was like a
struggle to get on a little bit but it's
very supportive this top it comes up
waist more I don't know why Bay comes up
spooling in the others but it's fine I
like it retype said it's like like I
said really supportive so yeah again
this one doesn't have just wool straps
but it's really tight and the back
detail is kind of like Criss crossed
over and then the leggings are the ones
with the big bound at the top which I
prefer personally because I think it
really sucks you in it just feels way
more supportive so I do we like that and
it's got the zip thing on the back like
all of them and the white fox ACK saved
yeah that's all the Jim sets I have this
track see that I haven't as well is from
white folks I've got some really cute
tractors at the moment and who uses
stuff and I've got another hoodie which
is like this but it's got like lace up
the sleeves it's kind of like defend tea
collection but in the washer at the
moment cause of worry yesterday but yeah
so I've got this red set and it comes in
two joggers I've got this down the
science Alliance and the high-waisted
and yeah that is all the gym wear that I
love they sent me a load but these are
just I just picked up the pieces that I
really love
yeah see if you have any questions
please comment below I'm really hoping
this is gonna motivate me to get back
into the gym proper like properly this
time
I was going hard with my eating healthy
and working out for such a long time and
they're just I feel like as soon as you
stop and you take a break it's so hard
to get back to it and I just it just
makes you feel better when you work out
I feel like and you eat healthier just
why do you have way more energy to you
just fo bettering myself like you just
feel so much better so I really do want
to get back to that but yeah I want to
get in shape in winters then when it
gets to summer I'm already in shape
