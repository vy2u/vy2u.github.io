me video I did do a question and answer
video a little while ago and and there
were so many questions unfortunately I
can't answer them all and anyone that
has YouTube knows if your video is like
40 minutes or like 20 minutes so it's
really long takes like three days to
upload and so yeah I don't want to make
the video too long because I want to get
this up as soon as I can so yeah and I'm
just gonna start from the top and I'm
just gonna wear a write down I'm going
to try and be sort of like quick with it
because last time I sort of blabbered on
and then that's why the video is so long
so I'm going to try and answer as many
of these as I can so the first one I'm
not going to say your names just because
I don't want to offend anyone worried
about its own name so I'm just going to
say the question and I'll answer it
because you'll know official question or
not anyway say yeah and so the first one
what college university do you or did
you go to so I went to a performing arts
college and I did dance and when you
danced acting and singing and I went for
about a year and a half and then
unfortunately I had to leave because I
couldn't afford to go anymore and it is
really really expensive and you can't
get utilized it's not like uni so unless
she gets up like a - I would you have to
be like amazing to get that and then
yeah it's really really expensive so
unfortunately I did have to quit so yeah
and favorite channels on YouTube biggest
inspiration when it comes to fashion and
makeup my favorite channels on YouTube
are all the really really well-known
ones I know you guys would obviously
already know them if you watch YouTube
but my favorite is Lauren Curtis I think
she's so cute and I just literally watch
our channel like all the time I'm
obsessed of her um my biggest
inspiration when it comes to fashion and
makeup it has to be on Instagram a more
easy I think that's how using
no I love her finches amazing and yeah
okay so what do you really hate about
people and what in a person makes you
like them and one thing that I really
really hate is light liars I've got a
lie about stupid things that's one thing
that really annoys me and and spiteful
people I don't expect for people either
and what in a person makes you like them
I like honest people and and I just love
those people to go out of the way to do
anything for you don't have some amazing
friends that do a lot for me so yeah I
love them and how do you keep your skin
clear I am very very lucky person my mum
has had good skin I think I inherited it
really but I do to look after my skin
I'm if you look after your skin your
makeup is gonna look amazing so I do
look after my skin face masks cleanse
tone moisturize a lot of you think I
wear makeup every single day the weight
but identity tone and I try not to wear
it too much I couldn't wear it like
every day and like when I'm going to
work and stuff I just will just put like
a little bit of bronze in my face just
to give myself a bit of a tan and then
do my eyebrows because I can't leave the
house without my rolls how did you work
up the courage to start a YouTube
channel and Sevilla is a lot of you guys
because I kept posting makeup post a lot
of you said I'll please you start
YouTube so I could like we can see how
you do things so I kind of just did it
because a lot of you asked me to um I I
remember I actually had a YouTube
account from April this year but it took
me till about June to actually start
recording videos because I was so like
overwhelmed by all like it's it's crazy
um but all the edges here and everything
I don't know my videos to be really crap
so I had to like sort of work out how to
use everything first but even now like I
need to get a good camera because this
camera is amazing for taking pictures
but when it comes to film when it's not
the best
I need to get a new camera and a defini
to invest in some light in so um yeah my
videos will hopefully progress and get
better also a lot of you say that all
your contour looks crazy like you need
to blend in more it's honestly the
camera and in real life my contour is
fine it's really blended in so I don't
know why on camera it looks crazy but
believe me it's been next person this
may be too personal but I'm interested
to know how you are able to afford all
of your makeup skincare etc I do have a
full-time job I work Monday to Friday I
work a sales admin so I just do like
admin job and I'm sort of like a PA for
National Sales Manager so yeah just
working in office 9 to 5:30 Monday to
Friday and yeah that's how I afford my
makeup and so and so are you straight
would you ever day to go I am 100%
straight I would add a girl presently
before that makes a bit of it sick but
nothing wrong with it at all but it's
just not for me
I am 106 straight so yeah and how do you
deal with the haters okay this one okay
it depends what mood I'm in because if I
if I had a day in a bad mood then I
like to take my anger out on them
because I just feel like they need it
like instead of taking out on my
boyfriend or my parents or my friend I
just take it out on them but my sons I'm
I do just block and delete them because
it is quite unprofessional of me to even
replies them but sometimes I just
they're a good way to get rid of the
tension and go that I'm bearded so yeah
and but most of the time I just block
and delete the comment because I like
her would you ever get plastic surgery
yes I would if you watched my other
video you know I've already had a boob
job so yeah I am even spastic surgery
doesn't bother me at all I always think
if you want to enhance something or you
want to change something then why not
like
I just don't see why not so yeah and
here are your makeup icons and
inspirations and there's so many like
literally the same Binet see like just
all of them on YouTube very much like
Walter pretty big ones like just I love
them all but Lauren case like I said
she's my fave and deeper fair wearing
makeup or natural I love her blah blah
for a makeup but sometimes and you love
just have like a fresh face and and I do
love those days when you go home and
take your makeup off and then your face
just feels like fresh and the trends not
moving but yeah I love my makeup so I'm
going to have to say I prefer wearing
makeup and how did you gain Instagram
followers to be honest I don't really
know and I'd say the one thing that got
me had quite a lot of followers was when
Lilly ghalichi posted my makeup picture
on her Instagram and if you know her
she's got like 1.1 million followers so
from that I had quite a lot come three
and and I'm quite a consistent post so
like I face which is quite a lot so I
just guess that's how I got seen Aviva
followed me but I don't really know man
um would you consider doing a lighter
coverage version of your usual makeup I
love it but it's too heavy
yeah of course like I love full coverage
that's just my personal preference I
love even though I won't need full
coverage really but I just love it but
yeah of course like I would definitely
do that for you and Omar I'm not going
to answer your question it's sick for
you to even think to ask me that but I'm
not going to answer it so what so Jack
sign I am a cancer and I was born on the
1st of July yeah and what got you
interested in makeup
I don't really know um I sort of was
quite artistic as like a young person
like when I was little like I was really
into art and things like that and then
as I got older I got into Performing
Arts so I've always kind of been quite
an art your person
and I'm obviously make up as an art form
so I think I've always sort of since the
age of right 13 14 when I was
experimenting with makeup I've been like
obsessed with it
um I was horrendous that makeup at that
age like you know everyone who saw that
dream at mousse and foundational live
your lips that was not nice but yeah
pretty much I've always been interested
in it since I can remember so you have a
boyfriend if so how long have you been
together yes I do have a boyfriend
and I've been with him 42 years now and
I just over two years he I don't post
him on my Instagram or my YouTube
because he doesn't like social media so
that's why you never see him I'm trying
to persuade him to do a video of me
because I've seen all these videos that
looked really funny like my boyfriend
that's my makeup and I just think it'd
be hilarious him to do my makeup but
he's just so against like social media
dangers isn't like it it doesn't want to
be on it
but I will keep trying to persuade him
anyway because that would just be such a
funny video um what's your favorite
makeup brands my favorite make around
I'm gonna have to say Mac Urban Decay
and Anastasia Beverly Hills and your
skin looks flawless even before you've
applied your makeup so more info on your
skincare please yeah I will just in care
routine video for you I did have one
upward about my skincare but the quality
of the video was so bad I was like this
is just makes me feel sick so I just
deleted it but I will do one for you and
yeah I will do your favorite singer love
ya I like you and my favorite thing that
is Eva Christina Aguilera or Jessie J
they've always been my fav
what made you want to start youtube dark
again I could have said and purely just
because a lot of you guys asked me for
videos and what's your all-time favorite
makeup product my dip for my Anastasia
Beverly Hills I could not live without
that and if someone said to me like that
you can only have one make up product
for the rest of your life that is what
it would be and because most days when I
go to work I'll go with no Mary quite
apart from my eyebrows I could always
have to have my eyebrows done and I
don't know why I just love to have my
eyebrows on
even when I'm wearing eye makeup yeah
and where do you get most of your makeup
inspiration again from what with you on
YouTube and celebrities and things like
that so yeah pretty much
YouTube or Cerberus and do you have any
five years now and I have any phobias I
know of um your favorite Chloe's brand
okay my favorite cry fan just does not
just look alike from write them like
it's not just because I promote them
because of would promote live if I
didn't like them but my Landers dress I
love the type so much like I get so many
emails like every day getting emails
like hi Holly we want to work with you
like we send you free trades would you
please from our private and things I'm
so passive if I work with because I'm
not going to promote something that I
don't like or that I think it's really
bad quality and tell you guys to go and
buy it with your hard-earned money like
I'm not going to do that so I am so so
so so so fussy with who I work with and
if you follow me on Instagram which
obviously you do because you've
commented on my Instagram and you'll
know that I do promote from my bandage
dress purely because they are just like
the clothing is such high quality for
the money than it is like this class I
think they're about 30 pounds sometimes
they're 20 pounds in the sale but they
are just like the quality of them is
just amazing they're heavy they're thick
you can just tell it the good material
and I've had a few companies send me
stuff because I've seen on their website
and be like okay so it's I've reached
about eighty pound and so it's really
high quality I like the look of it so
yeah why not I'm accepted the parcel and
it looks like it's been made in China
that's something you'd buy off eBay for
like two pounds so I just haven't
yeah and so yeah I'm really fast for I
work with so my favorite clover band has
got to be my bandage dress P because
high quality amazing products I don't
really like patterns I'm quite playing
person so and all of the scouts are like
playing so yeah they're definitely my
favorite your lips are amazing are they
natural or have you had fillers okay my
mom for you gotta watch this so sorry
mom but yeah I've had fillers and safe
on any when I came home and had a bruise
and while it from when I had some done
she was like why have you got bruising
her lip and I was like uh-oh I just got
drunk and bit my lip by accident
um but ya know I have had been done and
I went to an insert there's an Instagram
pages called Juno aesthetics and she is
a qualified nurse she doesn't make me
look stupid or like you know people go
too crazy and they look like a duck
she's very very um about the natural
kind of just enhancing a little bit just
to give you more sort of like fuller
natural looking lips so I don't think I
would go with anyone else
I've seen a lot of Instagram pages of
people getting it filler and some of
them take people from literally like no
lips to like huge lips like I just think
this crazy so and I think it's best if
you're going to get it done it's to get
a little bit first and if you want more
get more if you don't eat because if you
go big straight away then I mean hate it
it's too late you're gonna have to wait
for it to wear off what you're gonna
have to get it taken out it's going to
cost you more money so I just think if
you're going to get it done don't go
crazy just make sure you get a little
bit at a time and that's my advice for
you guys and where do you see yourself
in ten years in ten years
this is going to sound crazy but I would
love off of a blog have my own makeup
product like the Jacqueline Hill
champagne Bob like I would love to have
my own like highlighter or makeup
product but that is obviously crazy and
but that is something that I will work
hard and
surely I can do that but yeah like that
is where I see myself in ten years time
fingers crossed
so yeah that's one of your questions oh
that was a lot of questions so yeah and
this video is probably going to be crazy
long so I'm going to just shut up now
but yeah I hope you enjoyed this video
and I will see you again next time and
comment bye what you want to see next
or just message me whatever you want to
know next and I might do like a skincare
routine or another makeup tutorial but
just let me know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
