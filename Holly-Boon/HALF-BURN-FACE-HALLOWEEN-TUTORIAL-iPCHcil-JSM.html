side of it she just done my ID I'm
moving my face I'm not very foundational
no anything like that because one way to
do is I'm going to kind of smudge the
face paint over my face so I don't want
to put anything on this side so she just
on my eye and I'm going to start on the
scary side and so the first thing you
need is sculpt gel I don't know if you
guys have heard of this it comes in
three parts a B and C which basically
just like a flesh colored gel anyway the
first thing you want to do is take Part
A and Part B so it looks like this it's
pretty grim and so you're going to take
Part A and Part B so just a bit of each
commit you just want to mix these
together same amount from Part B as well
which looks a little more of a lighter
shade then you want to take part C and
this just allows you to be able to mix
the two together easier just like a
clear gel it's like this everything you
just want to mix all three of these
together
I'm just lips using the knife and mixing
these on a plate before apply it to my
face I'm going to take a lip liner and
you want to take off a nude color i
pinky shade or anything like that and
I'm just going to kind of sketch out
where I want to apply this so when I
first did this I actually knew suicide
when I first did this I actually am only
wanted it like halfway on my face I put
it it's like here and then end up doing
the whole side of my face and so you
just want to kind of sketch
where you want this to be take someone
own fitters Oh taking this sculpt gel
I'm using a blunt knife you want to use
kind of a spatula or something up then I
don't have anything like that so I'm
going to use this knife to apply this to
my face and wouldn't really advise using
the knife but this one's really really
fun so it's not going to hurt me right
up inside but we want to do now is take
this and it should just apply it in
these lines you kind of want to make
sure that you smooth out the edges they
bend them just get more and you just
kind of want to literally do it about
yes I wouldn't really recommend using a
knife especially not around your eye
area but like I said this one's already
blonde
and then just add a bit of detail to
this side of my face I'm going to just
draw like a star mark and I'm just gonna
press them in sculpt down on top of them
just literally smooth out the edges it
will help that when it dries it will
just make it blend a lot better okay
then you just want to leave that straw
take about five minutes you'll know when
it strikes it will fill that you're from
tight over your skin see how much dry so
for this next part you're going to need
a couple of paint brushes I'm using
these really thin ones I just find it a
lot easier to control and it just works
a lot better so I've got two two
paintbrushes one for black one for red
and you also need a sponge and we did
use a Beauty Blender unless you've got
an old Beauty Blender that you don't
mind ruining if not just cut up a sponge
that's what I've done just cut a bit off
a big sponge I put some fake blood this
one's actually from snazaroo special
effects gel blood and it's you've got
this from Tyndall's um just because this
one's already good faith about sensitive
skin and stuff because I get a bit funny
about using certain things in my face
you just need to face bones black and
red my Reds got me a black mix turmeric
from last time it's all good
oh you're also going to need a
translucent powder okay so once your
brackets dry enough I feel like it's
it's dry enough and when it takes on my
translucent powder on this sponge and
I'm just going to run this over it and
it just kind of sets it over and doesn't
make it look shiny
okay so once you're done with the
translucent powder you're going to go in
with the pain so I'm first of all just
going to go in with the red I'm just
going to take any paint brush and wait a
little bit
you know so just across as well you want
to make sure that you smush this
outwards also going to add some to this
side of my face
you want to drag some of this red over
here ago to smudge it basically
I'm that you mixing the two now so I'm
going in with the red and the black at
the same time it's just it makes you
look a lot better I think
okay so with this scope I'm just
literally gonna go over it with the road
you just want to keep adding details
where you feel like you need to I going
to set after that we're going to take
some of your fake blood on a sponge
so I'm going to pour some this on here
and then filled it you're just going to
I'm just going to top this all over this
whip makes all the difference like you
would need to do this step makes it look
so much more realistic
okay so that is the finished look
obviously you can't really walk around
one I shot I did pick up a all-white
contact lens in to make it look more
scary but it hurt my eye so I took out
so I'm not going to put that in today
but entirely up to you can you believe
it are there so put contact lens in or
whatever you want to do and there hope
you guys enjoyed this tutorial make sure
to give it a thumbs up if you did and I
will see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
