understand on the site excited to do and
I know you can relax for God's sake not
another foundation review but I'm sorry
2017 is the year or finding a highly
growl foundation and I feel like I've
done it and I'm so excited because the
lovely Spanish is so much I used it once
so I'm putting a hater next week but at
the moment I love it so I mean
if you put it on the site Oh mother this
is so bomb so I just took it all off I'm
going to show you because I though I
need to film this for everyone because
this is an amazing moment of this kind
of sick foundation so anyway and my eyes
have been so so Nicole's livers just
made them crack and they're from dry and
red but using serums oils eye creams as
you can imagine it and they're still
source so I think it's because I had I
make one for like 15 hours yesterday so
it's not helped but I'm going to lay off
too much eye makeup today I'm itching to
do something really natural my eyes are
just a little bit brown in the crease
and then to do some lashes so today is
main focus is skin so I'm wanting to
start for my skin today so I'm going to
prime and I'm going to use this hemp
pure hobo extract - for moisturize I use
these all over your body it's my
favorite moisturizer of all time I get
this from one local sunny store you can
get them in loads of different sin so
I'm just going to apply a little bit
because I've been quite dry which is so
crazy for me yeah because I never ever
ever have dry skin so the fact that I
have dry skin is so cozy yeah just the
needs of washed away this is proud of
what do you see whether light snow in it
cold it's just nasty low bar so I think
that's why but
since the foundation I don't think to
your understand I put it on five ten
minutes ago and I was like okay I'm
graphing what the staff I'm redoing it
the video because the beeps these people
need to know they need to know about
explanation so it is obviously you know
by the title but it's the hourglass
stick foundation oh my god I know it's
expensive so I understand this is pricey
but this is unbelievable and I purchased
this because Jaclyn hill mentioned this
in her 2016
beauty favorite and anything that
Jackson says goes because Jackson does
not lie if a price is good Jackson does
not lie so I was like I need to try it
and it's so good it's like really full
coverage but the finish is very dewy
glowy not really map which is why I love
a local coverage while I like to look
too much and this about it I got the
shade golden tan I got this from Space
NK online I will link embrace you guys
want to get it and I let you just
guessed my shade and I think this is
okay normally I hate stick carnations I
don't know what it is about them I find
them really hard to get any like payoff
when you're applying it but this and
then I'm just going to bend it in my
Peter goes oh it's so easy to blend into
throw it it's really creamy its own eyes
like Oliver obviously I guess is if
you're not I mean you have full coverage
but you don't want to look too so Matt
and still your skin feel dry and
horrible this is perfect like honestly
but on this day I love this so much I
can't even tell you I've never felt this
way about a foundation before I'm in
love and I've only tried it once this is
the second time so I have been quite dry
on the art form of my face I'm still a
tiny tiny tiny bit oily in my t-zone but
not too much because the weather's been
really cool and my skin's a little dry
so I haven't been as oily as one Andrea
but if you've got combination skin dry
skin just using moisturizer and even
oily skin aside I love this inflexible
skin types to be honest anyway so you
can see that I'm going to use the NARS
radiant creamy concealer in shade
custard
you can see that is bowl forgot how good
it was
do you ever just forget how good some
things are just like oh my god just
concealer the only thing I hate about it
is it runs out so quick and it's really
expensive like 22 pounds it runs out so
fast like you're someone that wears
makeup like nearly every day you're
going to be nuts for God's sake run up
so far okay so now I'm going to set my
well applied concealer with the RCM a no
color powder I mean a peg recapping so I
off what I get it actually did get this
up Amazon and I paid 30 pounds for it
because it sold out and so many UK
websites and I just rewind it I'm so
impatient if I want something I win it
now so I did pick I just played it for a
panel for it but that is so dramatically
I just so expensive
okay I'm going to apply this with my
Beauty Blender
ok so I love this I love this powder
decided just started right now I love it
I love it I love it a little bit blue
and you don't get any flashback
apparently which is good
I've seen a few people test it out and
they didn't get any flashbacks I was
like there have a thicker powder okay so
I'm just going to set the rest of my
face
just a little bit because I'm quite
direct and smooth and equal time um
I'm gonna take my medium plus Studio Fix
perfecting how it are why not
and the brush and we need is the
concealer blend spooky and weird like a
cedar blend brush because I like to read
the rules so I check so much so
unjustly I'm like shut up okay so for
bronzer you already know some renews
them that give me time I'm sorry but I
can't fly one bar so you just got to
deal with it this is my only ground or
never ever ever ever ever stop reading
this but I don't think anyway
so normally because we start my everyday
makeup because sometimes whether I wanna
wear makeup right of them wear a lot of
makeup dishes like my guru - that makes
sense
and because I don't wear dry to my
makeup every single day so normally I
would just run and leave it here but
today I just want to contour compete in
it you know so that's what I'm going to
do so I'm going to take the contour kit
by Anastasia Beverly Hills I might use
this one in such a long time I started
using it again like last week and I was
like okay the real it is showing here
this is the light palette I think to
like to medium and we set the darkest
shade here also I notice everything I've
got my nail color and I think it's just
called dusty rose and a car than make
coming your mobile API looks like maybe
not I'm slave and you start writing that
down because those of you always ask me
like what is my nail file after I need
to start remembering because that's to
 on me for not remembering okay
where is it is small like stippled 15
tumblr or Mac a car under the number
because it's rocks I like to use it to
contour because it's so small and it's
easy to just quite a file a little bit
at a time rather than a light load and
then you like down a few much
okay so I'm going to take this brush
from Too Faced which could miss the
right brush to contour my forehead
because I don't want it to be to deny it
and this rocks kind of display really
helps to blend it out as soon as this
world so it's going to go out on to my
eyes because nothing we doing it up with
the eyes like I said just want a little
bit of room in the crease of thing so
I'm going to take my Mac give me Sun and
just obviously a warm bronze off and I'm
going to apply some of this in the Cree
fluffy brushes from Sigma X the e38
diffuse diffused crease brush it still
relieved it in the crews - leave it to
me to leave it just like I'm I'm so I
pass a moment eating anything today
my Linda Stouffer I should have no
energy you know what right I'm so like I
don't know a song video is on so chill I
don't talk much and all videos are just
chat bear for ages but angel
something so I can you to shut up
because then I have to edit it well it
takes me so long
okay so now I'm going to apply some
mascara I'm going to use the benefit
they are real mascara since I've been
using this I can't stop using it
okay so if you have nice gorgeous
beautiful eyelashes and you can just
leave this right here but I don't my
eyelashes are awful so I'm going
to apply lashes and when he is it any
good Ichi
oh this opulence opions opera's openers
I don't know so these are a lot more
natural market okay so I like to apply
my lashes with tweezers or finds a lot
easier so if you guys struggle try it
with tweezers just grab them in the
middle like that and you want to wait
into the eyelash glue is slightly dry
it's not nearly dry pretty much dry okay
cheese with Irish food rice and then
stick a Jew eye so I
start off by stick in the middle first
and then I'll just play around with the
sides so then I want to move that and
then move the front okay so once my
lashes are dry you can apply some of the
scar right on top it's a tiny bit just
how it's of been my nut flushes in with
the fake one so I'm just going to apply
some of the subscribe to the bottom
lashes as well really ever really use
this one like so you can get this is
just like a pan I'll link it below
anyway but when you use this one it's
called infatuation my makeup Pete and
I'm going to take this toothpaste miss
the right brush that I used earlier okay
it's a highlight just a tiny tiny bit
but I'm going to take my iconic London
illuminated drops because these are my
tried or a diet buffing highlight very
good you need courage Holly b10 you get
10% off I think
I'm not sure crime I'm a bar link it
behind but needs off Saipan somebody say
this helps to make it look more like
skin rather than a powdery highlight and
I'm going to take my Beauty Blender and
then Lisa
so my go-to lip color like at the moment
I wear it all the time is the lip liner
by Mac in short down and then I like to
use the mariah carey lipstick in bit of
bubbly now this is you kind of actually
get this color anymore which is kind of
annoying and but they do so many similar
shows so you can find a similar shade oh
no miss is quite similar just a bit
lighter and but there'll be loads
similar anyway so Matt Smith works
really well
now I'm fearful when it's them slightly
just the out of our line it and they'll
just like to apply lipstick and the
center of my lips so that is the
finished look I hope you guys enjoyed
this tutorial and I know it's quite
simple but this is like my very - if I
don't want to wear too much makeup so
also if you do want to if you can spend
the money or if you don't mind spending
the money try the hourglass foundation
because honestly I've never tried
anything like this it's so amazing and I
am so honest when it comes more reviews
and this if my parents foundation of
reason reason is constantly in all my
tutorials now well honestly I love it so
much so I know it is pricey like it's
ridiculously expensive in my opinion but
if you've got the money or you do wanna
you don't mind spending the money then
please try a peace treaty to try it
because the promise sure is so good so
you know I hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial make sure it's give it a thumbs
