video it's just not that serious she's a
bit of fun I like it just funny
I'm gonna recreate recreate and they
looked at you today at school and I
don't actually have any pictures to show
you which is so annoying I wish I had
some but I literally deleted my facebook
about five years ago which had all of
the pictures on so I don't know how to
get hold of any pictures I don't have
any anymore which is really annoying
because it was so funny my wakeup was
just so bad like it's just funny
so yeah just what I did a bit of a funny
video it's just gonna be a laugh don't
take it too serious
we've all been there we've all been
through there be funny okay and when it
was like 2006 2007 at school this was
the trend okay so I just went to
superdrug and I picked up your staff
that I used to use sometimes they don't
do any more so I've just picked some
stuff that's like similar okay so the
first thing I used to do is use this
dream up moose berry most fun Dacian and
in the shade nude so I don't know if
this is what this is gonna look like I
haven't even matched myself this is just
the shade that I used to use I know that
I used to use the shade nude so we're
just gonna see how this goes I like
always you surprised with my hands so I
never used primer didn't even know
primer was back then yeah would have
been about 1213 at this point yeah okay
so we're gonna take the dream up mousse
foundation by Maybelline this is weird
it's like I'm gonna have to scrape this
out with my on the back of my nail like
this we're just gonna put this little
skin I do remember this foundation
always being really soft like I did used
to put loads on as well so don't mind me
okay this shades too light for me now
but at the time it was my show you okay
this is what I used to do I used to put
it over my lips you have to put it over
the lips that was what we used to do oh
my god it's all in my name and we're
gonna leave a line because that's just
what I used to do this was definitely
the shade that I used to use so I don't
think mine was very orange when
I think I actually knew similar like and
yeah make sure you get it all on the
lips art
oh yeah Piniella at lovely job if you
think I'm joking I feel not funny okay
and you weren't in sort of right yeah
eight nine or ten if you only a
secondary school in the year two
thousand six seven you pre don't know
like that this was a trend but this was
a trend okay and if you did then just do
what we used to do okay so once you've
done that we're gonna take a little bit
more I'm gonna go all over the lips out
because you want the lips to bend in
move your face okay that's what we do
I'll bitterly a nice job and look lovely
I look lovely right so then what I used
to do is use this Rimmel London eyebrow
pencil with the little brush thing on
the end and this is in the shade hazel
and my eyebrows were a lot of thinner
back then because that was a trend as
well so what you do is take this little
brush brush my eyebrows are up lovely
job take the eyebrow pencil and we're
gonna draw round the eyebrow like this
at the start and then the end of its
gonna be really thin nice nicely done
so you want to brown your eyebrow at the
front of that and then we're gonna
really really fill it in yeah we're
gonna keep the a nice and thin just a
long little line bingo so we like it
gonna do the same on the other side
we're gonna round it off of the front
that Mary said they're not even that's
not looking for we're just we're just
slapping on we're not we're not going
for even eyebrows okay eyebrows on fleek
so then what we're gonna do is we're
going to put some eyeshadow on and I've
got this bourgeois blue eye shadow
palettes this is called the smokey
stories I'm gonna take the white shade
and put it all over the lid I'm going to
use this little brush that comes with it
so I'm going to take this white shade
right here
lovely and I'm gonna put it all over the
lid don't forget
as part of the lip so we're gonna walk
that all over the lid up no eyes
that looks lovely nice it was shimmer to
it as well nice it was shimmer shimmer
for the lads at school come on boys
stop a little shimmer shimmer in my eyes
and we're gonna bring it quite far up
just above the crease right up that
lovely okay so don't worry about the
fallout we like a bit of that look if
you think I'm exaggerating but this is
actually how I do my makeup okay this is
not me exaggerating I'm being deadly
serious
lovely looks lovely hello bit more now I
used to use to opportu mascaras so I
feel like I was the plug with this
mascara I plugged this mascara at school
every was I what was called you and I
was like I know everyone for my
eyelashes look good what the okay
so from the top eyelashes I used to use
the Max Factor 2000 calorie dramatic
volume and I used to use the whole
bottle in one go so we're gonna put a
layer on this is layer one then we're
going to leave that for a minute as you
layer two in a minute for bottom
eyelashes I used to use this Maybelline
great lash a very black mascara and we
do like a bit of extra mascara just you
know on the bottom there just you know
underneath the lashes twist mascara
everywhere we like a bit of that so then
we're going to go for the bourgeois
blush in the shade 43 which is the
pinkest one I could find
I'm gonna take this little brush and
we're gonna go just on the cheeks nicely
smells like mine on the pink of the bet
alright the pink of the better I'm just
gonna pile it on that looks beautiful
now we're gonna go from the scar and
number three you're just gonna keep
putting mascara on until the whole
bottles running um hours later now we're
going to do coat number 58 six and a
half hours later and then lastly we're
going to do coat number 105 it's now I'm
going to take some dream matte mousse
again and we're just going to put some
walnuts because I don't feel like we've
got enough and we're just gonna rub it
in that
a little bit more as well just a little
bit more right in there now we're gonna
take this gloss I couldn't find a clear
one I used to use a clear wasn't I can't
follow this will be Mattel you son
it's from Bourjois and this is in the
shade 29 we're gonna put that all on top
there you're gonna keep doing it until
you turn the gloss brown we are just
gonna do a little bit more mascara cuz I
feel like we need a bit more what now
we're gonna do the hair so what you
might do is you want to take a lumber
hair from this side your head you're
gonna pull it round that up there we go
and then we're gonna pin it and then
just to finish off I'm going to spray
myself with some Charlie pink okay so
hope you guys enjoyed this video I
thought would be so funny to recreate
this look I did used to do this and this
is not exaggerated like this is
literally what my face and my hair you
still at like and I feel like it was a
trend in 2006 the more foundation on the
lips and gloss the better
