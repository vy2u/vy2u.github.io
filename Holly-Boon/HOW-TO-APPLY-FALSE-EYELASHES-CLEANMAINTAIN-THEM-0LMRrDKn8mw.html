channel just checking out my lipstick on
my teeth that is just like so annoying
my name is Holly Boone if you're new
here head there but dropping things this
is a fourth time I've tried to record
this little intro thing I'm just
out every time but yeah so today I'm
going to do a video
what about eyelashes so how to clean
them how to stick them on I have to make
them blend in that sort of thing I am
going to use a pen that I've already
used I'm going to show you how I wipe
them how I get rid of this glue and all
that kind of stuff
see I need to clean them because I want
them yesterday they've got loads of
excess glue on them and they're just
messy I like to use makeup wipes to
clean my eyelashes you want to make sure
that you use the makeup like that's
quite wet like not like one of those
makeups it's quite dry because if you
use like one that's quite dry it will
just get looser fluff like stuck to your
eyelashes and then it's just a nightmare
trying to get the fluff out of the
lashes so mate make sure you get some
wipes that are quite wet I like to use
these Johnson's face care onesies just
the blue ones they actually offer dry
skin so they're a bit more moisturizing
so I definitely recommend these ones
what I like to do with these wipes is I
will hold at the end where the glue is
first folks I want to wipe off all the
excess mascara because when I do apply
these lashes I tend to apply a little
bit of mascara just make them blend in
so I do get a buildup of mascara so I
like to hold the end where the glue is
not the lash fan then I'll use my wipe
to wipe gently at the lashes and to
remove all of the mascara so you want to
be really careful when you do this you
don't want to rub too hard and like I
said you do want to really moisturize
and wipe so like a really wet wipe
because if you use well it's quite dry
you end up getting bits of fluff stuck
in the lashes which is a nightmare
so yeah just gently start robbing the
lashes to remove the excess mascara then
what I like to do is remove all the
excess below and I like to do this
because I thought if you get rid off of
blue
it just becomes a nightmare to try and
get it off and it becomes really chunky
so I like to use my tweezers for this
you can use your nails and
because I have long a critic now I
sometimes use my nails and but I think
tweezers is the best so you want to hold
the end where the actual lash is and
then just take your tweezers and gently
start pulling away at the glue just to
start removing it but you do want to do
this rejecting against you don't want to
pull to hugs you will break the lash
band these eyes are quite strong
I use these under two Koko lashes or
more which I love these are my go-to
lashes and the lash bands needs to be
quite strong I get a lot of uses out
these I let you use these lashes so many
times before I get a new pair for some
reason there is a little black dot hair
I don't know why that's there I mean
it's not on the back drop I've wiped the
camera lens five million times I really
don't know why there's just like a dot
there so please just yeah I call that
that's brilliant oil okay so now I'm
gonna move on to stick in the model how
I get them to blend in and stuff I
purposely haven't put much on my eyes of
lips you put a bit of brown in the
crease that's it
I don't we're doing or anything cause I
want to show you how I bring them in
when I don't use like loads of eyeliner
now the first thing I like to do is
apply a little bit of black along the
lash line I used to use a liquid liner
but I find it better to use black
eyeshadow because it's not too harsh
it's not too intense it just kind of
gives you that fullness on the lash line
and also it helped cement in so I'm just
going to take this black shadow from my
to face palette you can use any black
eyeshadow new one and I'm going to use
my sigma winged liner brushes to the er6
brush it's a really tiny fine brush this
is really really good for lining the
lash line because it's really small and
precise
you
yeah just kind of pressing it on really
and it really does make such a
difference especially if your user
lashes that have a lash band the next
thing you want to do is I like to take a
black eyeliner you can use a gel liner
and that little tiny brush that works
just as good for this step as well I'm
gonna take this pencil and I'm gonna
just lift up my eye like this and then
I'm just gonna fill in my top waterline
so just here so I'm gonna just run this
black here let's put yourself in the eye
I've poked myself in the eye so nice I
only hurt so bad so I'm yeah you just
wanna fill in your top waterline and but
you can use gel like I said a really
good job I know for the top waterline is
the in block jaw line in 77 it's a
really dark matte black and it also
stays in the war line all day so next
thing we want to do is apply some
mascara I'm just gonna apply some my
L'Oreal telescopic
c1o just apply a little bit of mascara
to your natural lashes if her lashes are
quite straight you might want to curl
your lashes first before you put mascara
on already could have code them a little
bit but okay next I wanna talk about
eyelash glue eyelash glue I mean I have
tried every single eye or you can ever
imagine I really don't know how people
find that they can use duo glue
I really cannot use it doesn't stick my
eyelashes the corners start flicking off
it just doesn't work for me and the only
two eyelash screws that work for me
this one wished from House of blushes
I've never run out this one is so good
and this one doesn't irritate my eyes
this one is really good and your
eyelashes will not move with this and
also the demure eyelash it's blue I
don't know if they still have it on
their website every time I go on there
to get it it's always kind of sold out
which is annoying but that one is really
really good but I would say the house of
lashes 1 is better because it doesn't
irritate my eyes as much I don't know if
you can get this in the UK this is the
problem because I actually got sent this
to me in PR ages ago and I'm just like I
don't even know if you can get in the UK
but I'm gonna try my best to find it
and if I find it I'll link it below I
just had lipstick on my teeth and I
don't know how long that's been there
but anyway see I will try my best to
find this online in the UK and I will
link it below if I find it but it's such
a good honestly your eyelashes will not
move it's just yeah it's worth it it's
even worth getting it from America to be
honest just buy a few at a time so you
know it's worth it so you want to make
sure that you put enough eyelash glue on
the inner corner and the outer corner
especially because those the areas which
tend to lift off so just make sure you
apply a nice amount of glue don't apply
too much even because it would take
longer to dry and it'll just be more
messy when you try and apply it so just
try and get that happy medium so like
not too much but not you know make sure
it is enough so next thing I like to do
is leave them alone to dry it down I
mean a lot of people tend to wait sort
of a few seconds but I like to give it a
few minutes because lashes are pretty
much nearly dry that's the best time to
stick them on because they've gone so
easy if you try to apply your lashes
when the last row is wet so if I try to
apply them now it just wouldn't happen
like you just would not happen it would
just be messy
the corners will flick up we try to
stick that in that and flicks up so you
really need to be patient and just give
it enough time to dry
I like to give it two or three minutes
because then I feel like they're pretty
much dry and they just literally gone
really easy so yeah next thing make sure
you give it enough to her name okay so
now we're going to stick them on you can
do this two ways I have been sticking
Lush's on for so long now I find it a
lot easier than when I first started
you're kind of like a newbie to this I
would recommend using tweezers because
this is going to be the easiest way to
apply them I mean I have false nails so
I find it easy to do it this way but I'm
going to show you how to do tweezers
because if you're new to this or if you
find it hard to use your nails or if you
have short nails then tweezers are the
best option so you do want to kind of
wiggle your eyelash a little bit like
this because sometimes they do come
quite straight like that and it's harder
to stick them on so I'm taking my lashes
on the tweezers like this I'm going to
come up and over rather than straight
and then the first thing I will do is
stick the middle and I will hold it for
a few
and then what I'd like to do is move the
inner corner so pick that up moves up
and then move the outer corner like that
this lipstick on the tee situation is
bad like oh well did I wear red lipstick
for this just don't mind me anyway
so I'm gonna then close my eye and I
like to place my finger underneath my
eyelash just kind of move my finger
around just to make sure that it sticks
upwards and that is the easiest way I
can explain it I am NOT the best
explaining things I do apologize but
that is how I do it another thing that
you can do if you want is just apply a
little bit of mascara just in there so
what I like to do is just kind of push
the mascara and the eggs and it really
just blends in your natural lashes with
the fake ones so just kind of press it
in and blink a little bit yeah so that
is how I stick my lashes on I hope you
guys found this video useful I hope I
explained it okay guys enjoyed it make
sure it's give it a thumbs up if you did

in my next video bye everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
