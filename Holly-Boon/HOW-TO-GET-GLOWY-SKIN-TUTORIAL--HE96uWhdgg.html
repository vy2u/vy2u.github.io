filming a video one has to get really
nice glowy dewy looking skin depending
on skin type for dry skin and all your
skin
I'm gonna tell you I'm going to do the
way that I would do because I've got a
skin but I'll talk you through what you
know if you've got dry skin as well um
so ya already have my eye makeups to
save some time and I just want to focus
on the skin in this video so the first
thing that I'm going to do is just prime
my face using the Smashbox primer water
and I highly recommend using this for
both skin types it's just really
hydrating really nice she's supposed to
really refreshing and yeah
also please um ignore my hair because I
put so much oil in it he's gone past the
point looking shiny it looks wet um
having absolutely none of that yeah so
next I'm going to take the Becca
backlight filler this is really good if
you've got dry skin as well and so if
you've got dry skin I would fully
recommend and moisturize it before you
actually the farmer wore as well and my
sister's got sort of like such dry skin
like so bad it literally ended up on a
face just soaks it just soaks it up so
quick so I normally put moisturizer
primer water and then I'll use the
backlight fill by Becca again you can
use this we have both skins up although
if you have really really oily skin
mine's not too bad but it's what really
worries get up we won't recommend using
this but next I'm going to take the dual
air flash foundation this foundation is
again really really good for both skin
types oily or dry the only problem with
this foundation is it uncommon very many
shades there's only like five or six
shades and it's expensive and it runs
out quite quick I'm not gonna lie so
that is kind of annoying but there's
loads of foundations that you can choose
up to depend on your skin type I'm just
using this one because it works for both
and I really like it so yeah
so if you want super full coverage you
can obviously go over and add another
layer and the good thing with this
foundation is when you build it up to
full coverage and it doesn't look cakey
or anything I couldn't know that you've
got loads on so it's really really good
foundation so if you concealer I'm going
to take the NARS radiant creamy can see
that I know I can't believe it but I've
actually found another one lie out see
if I can love and this one is just as
good to fit me this one says the
consistency is a little bit more full
full coverage then the fit me concealer
but this one is balm it doesn't crease
so I have a new fave and this is in
shade custard
so after that I'm not going to bake
because I don't want to be really mouth
obviously I want to this look to be
quite unique so I'm actually going to
take my highlight brush by Sigma I'm
going to take the laura mercier
translucent powder and I'm just going to
literally just some of this under my
eyes and where I've applied concealer
okay so I'm going to talk about cream
contouring today which is a bit crazy
for me cuz I never do cream bronzer it
not be taking the iconic contour kit I'm
such a huge fan of their products they
send me like a package with rows of
leather products to try and I've been
slightly loving them at the highlight if
and I'm going to be using the highlight
in this video see you guys can see but
all the products I bomb I'll link them
below and again and there's such a good
price as well not expensive or even
higher so yeah I love it and this is the
first time we're using this I'm actually
going to take this brush by an iconic
London again it's like one of those
oval-shaped brushes and to contour so
I'm going to take it and take this shade
right here
oh my god I think I've gone back to
loving cream contouring now I love the
way that brush supply is there you
definitely want a cream cleanser if
you've got dry skin you don't want to
use too many powders on your face
because you'll just end up clinging to
dry patches and things like that so
definitely go for a cream contour if
you've got really dry skin absolutely
love this brush to contour with I think
it supposed to be an eye brush because
it's quite small but I'm a white
obsessed I feel like I'm gonna cream
contour like quite a lot now I'm glad
some types switch it up so some mascara
ways over mom of powder because um I
want it to just be set so I'm going to
go in with a potato bread contour kit
I'm going to take that trade there I'm
just going to go over that contour
and then just taking this powder brush
I'm just going to go in with this banana
shade here it's going to run that little
bit under my eyes I'm also just going to
run some of that under the contour just
to sharpen up okay so now for highlight
now I want to be like super duper doing
like it's all about do we highlighted
skin it's summer bronzing highlight skin
is everything so first of all before I
apply powder harder and what's going to
take this iconic London cream highlight
stick which looks like this you go and
stand in the natural sunlight with no
makeup on you'll be able to see with the
sunlight naturally hit your face and the
high points of your cheeks kind of just
above your eyebrow here
you know I never bring your highlight
too far down here where your pores are
because it's going to make your paws
down out more so you wanted to kind of
keep it in the high point of your
cheekbone she's going to take the laura
mercier a shimmer block and take that
gold turning that light shade just there
and then she's just going to file it on
top of worlds like that cream stand for
my lips I'm actually going to take this
iconic and London liquid lipstick and
this is in I can't even say that I'll
put it in the description box I won't
even say that such an idiot I can't read
