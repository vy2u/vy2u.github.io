channel and hello hi if you're new here
my name is Holly Boone so in today's
video I thought it'd be cool to do a
step by step in detail video on how to
do this I like this for me is one of the
easiest eye looks to do and I think you
guys are gonna find it easier to
recreate and you actually think and once
it's all broken down and I'll tell you
really in detail how to do it there are
any in detail tutorials you want to see
in regards to eye looks let me know cut
creases winged liner anything like that
and a half years ago I could not do a
shadow
I couldn't blend thy shadow I've never
even really done much eye shadow so it
just goes to show practice makes perfect
and I know you guys can do it
so if you only see houses I looked at
the end and keep on watching so if you
liked it don't forget the thumbs up that
helps me out ladies appreciate it thank
you
okay so I've already done this I of
camera I want you to completely focus on
one side and just go really in depth
with it and teach you guys how it's good
okay so the first thing I'm going to do
is I'm going to carve up my brow and I'm
gonna apply an eyeshadow base so I'm
going to use my P Louise base this is
the best place ever to get the most
people out of your eyeshadows and for me
it just sits really nicely it drives
down well and doesn't budge around and I
like to set it which is great if you
don't have the P Louise base you can use
a concealer if you want I would try and
go for more gataki type of concealer and
a full coverage that's just going to
give you the best for your eyeshadow in
my opinion if you something that's too
watery then you're gonna have to set it
because I want to actually slide around
and it's just not going to ask her to
create and that kind of stuff so yeah if
you don't have this base then definitely
get more of a tacky kind of conceal I
like a sticky concealer that's gonna
help your shadows to stick to at the
base so I'm going to apply the base
using my Mac 195 brush I absolutely love
this brush for this purpose it's really
big and it just applies to put it pretty
well so yeah first everybody just carve
out the brow so I'm gonna go just under
the brow first but Dickens it up it's
gonna be hard for me to talk Frieda step
because I have to concentrate
okay so once I've done that I'm then
gonna take more of this base on this
brush and I'm gonna start to press it
into the eye the reason why I'm pressing
it on is because I want to get the most
coverage and also I don't want any brush
stroke marks on the eye I want it to be
nice and seamless see I'm just gonna
press this on the lid you want to use a
synthetic brush to apply your concealer
because you don't want your brush to
absorb any of look and see you know you
want to just lay it down so you need a
synthetic flat brush for this for my
crease the first thing I'm going to do
is I'm actually going to go with the
darkest shade that I'm gonna be using in
my crease instead of going over for
transition color I know that sounds
crazy but when I do color this works so
much better and so I'm gonna first go
for this purple color here so I'm gonna
take my two three two looks classic
shader brush this brush is perfect for
this okay
this project is so good for doing this
the wall major is press it on in the
crease you'd always think it too high
you want to keep it only slightly just
above the crease and I'm gonna bring it
all the way in as well it doesn't have
to be neat at this point so you just
want to pack on as much color as
possible and using bright colors I
prefer to go this way instead of doing
my transition color first because this
just seems to work better especially
when using bright cut so next thing
we're do is take this light purple color
here and I'm gonna use this shade on my
Sigma defuse to crease Etha eight brush
any sort of crease brush would be
absolutely fine a fluffy brush for this
and one way to do first is I'm gonna
start to press there on the eye around
the edge of where I placed that purple
so I'm just going around the edge of
that and I'm just pressing it end so I'm
not doing any swiping motions no
circular motions at the moment I'm just
pressing this color on around the edge
of that dark purple again don't take it
up too high because we're going to do
some blending in a second so you don't
want to bring the shadow up too high to
the point where it's in your eyebrow
because you won't have room to blend so
you want to keep it quite close to the
edge of that purple okay
so no okay said don't worry about with
it's okay the minute it's gonna be fine
right it's the next step isn't when I
just wipe off the excess off this brush
I just used on the back of my hand I'm
just taking off the excess product right
and I've done that I'm gonna start to go
backwards and forwards and do circular
motions again you want to keep this
quite close to that edge of that purple
color because you don't want to bring
this up too high just yet because we're
not blending up this at the moment we're
blending out this dark purple into the
pink so don't worry about the line
around the pink we're not worried about
that just yet we're just going to run
this purple into the pink so yeah I'm
just going to do circular motions and
we're going to keep this on the edge of
that purple this does take time blending
always takes time you need to be willing
to have the patience to stay here in bed
for quite a while because it is gonna
take Ohio so the next thing you wanna do
is take a clean fluffy brush you don't
wanna have to be any color on this brush
that's all just clean nothing on it and
this is a map 2 to 4 brush this is a
really fluffy brush and we're gonna
start to go over that pink that was
known for words but like I said we don't
want any color on this brush you will
need brush to be clean and we're gonna
go backwards and forwards over that he's
saying pink base like light purple then
I'll get same thing
yeah back and forth over that light
purple color and as you can see it will
start to blend it nicely
okay so we've diffused that slightly now
this pot here isn't blended okay so what
I'm gonna do is go back to that light
purple I'm going to dip back into that
color on this brush and I'm going to do
the same steps I just done so I'm gonna
press out over the edge of the purple
and then I'm gonna wipe with the excess
on the back of my hand and I'm gonna
start to do circular motions again I'm
back was influence once you've done you
lay down the color and your buns are
blend you all know is that you've kind
of diffused the color that you laid down
and I want to keep that really vibrant
and refold so
- do it again and go back and blend
again on the edge so yeah it's just a
process you should keep doing it until
you are completely happy I'm gonna move
on to the next color so we're gonna go
slightly darker I'm gonna apply this the
outer corner is through the center of
the lid and to the inner corner as well
we're gonna bring out too high okay you
want to keep this shadow quite low I'm
gonna take this dark purple color here
so I used that one and now we're going
to use this one this one's really dark
and we're gonna apply this I said in the
outer corner through the center of the
lid and in the inner corner as well it
was gonna darken up and this brush is my
exact blend a thirty-two sigma brush I
love this again for packin all color
well this brush is quite small so it's
good I'm gonna bring it through the
center of the lid and I'm just pressing
this on I'm not rubbing it I'm just
pressing on so I'm gonna get as much
pigment as possible and you have a green
of rise to the under corner as well I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna go back to my two
three two which is the deluxe classic
shader brush and I'm gonna go back to
this shade right here which is the shade
that we applied first of all I'm not
gonna apply too much to this brush but
what I'm gonna do is go over the edge of
the stark color just press it on again
then I'm gonna go back to my diffuse
crease III a brush and I'm gonna go back
to that lighter purple color and really
Zacks anything we've done before so I'm
going to blend the edge so yeah like I
said before blending is going to be the
part that's gonna take the longest and
it's the most tedious but it gives the
best result if you spend a lot of time
blending eyeshadow it would just looks
so amazing so it's definitely worth it
the more time I spend on blending the
better to be honest
so yeah we're blend in that edge again
go back to my eyeshadow base frumpy
Louise and I'm gonna just apply some
this under my eye and we're gonna finish
the shadow off under the eye before we
do the halo part so I'm gonna just pack
this on press it in again the Mac
one-nine-five bra so I'm gonna go to the
purple color
we first-years which is this one right
here it's not the darkest back for the
second darkest I'm gonna pick this up my
two three two locks classic shader brush
again and I'm gonna just apply this to
my lower lash line all the way across to
the inner coil then I'm gonna go to my
838 diffuse crease brush use that light
is purple color and I'm gonna apply this
underneath as well underneath that
purple and you want to make sure you
connect in the shadows on the outer
corner of the eye then I'm gonna go to
the darkest color in the palette that we
used on my Sigma e30 to exact blend
brush and I'm gonna apply to the outer
corner and the inner corner this part
here we're going to be adding glitter so
I mean you can just bring it all the way
across because you're gonna cover it
with glitter anyway I'm gonna go back to
this brush which had the light purple
color on it I'm gonna blend that I'm
going to take my peeler Wiis base again
I'm just putting some in the back of my
hand and again with my Mac 195 brush
we're gonna cut the crease we're only
gonna do it to this part here of the eye
obviously to create the halo eye and
we're going to bring this just above the
crease so that when you open your eye
you can still see in the glitter you
don't want to bring it down too far if
you apply this in your crease so only
this part here when you open your eye
you're not going to see the glitter also
we want to make the eye look bigger and
more open so by applying is just above
the crease it does that as well
one wanna do first is I'm gonna
just draw a line down the middle of my
eyelid and then we're gonna do is I'm
going to press it all into them happy
the reason why I'm not going to talk
while I do it is because I have to
really concentrate I don't wanna mess it
up so that's what I'm going to do as you
guys are going to see so when you do
this you want to make sure that you
follow the natural shape of your eye you
don't want to curve it around too much
and the same way you don't hit it too
straight either so you want to just
follow the natural shape of your eye so
next thing we do is take this foiled
yellow color here which I love I'm gonna
pick this up on the same brush I just
used for the base I just give it a bit
with white and walked off the excess
Cassander and then I'm going to use this
same brush to apply that little yellow
car so I'm just going to start to press
it exactly where I put that shadow base
I love purple yellow together it's um
one of my favorite combinations like I
said you can do this with any color you
want you don't have to use purple you
can you pick your orange you can do
yellow you anything you want we are
going to put in a bit of glitter on top
as well
as you can see on this eye I did leave
it you know like that I don't know if I
actually know as well okay so once
you've done that obviously we don't want
just two straight lines either side or
what I make sure it's nice and blended
and you can see each color as well so
the first thing we do is take this small
pencil brush is from iconic London and
I'm gonna go with that light purple
color there which is just here this is
the first color I'm going to use and I'm
gonna apply this closest to the yellow
so I'm just gonna first of all press it
on it looks messy at the minute don't
worry I'm just going to press it on then
I'm just gonna start to just pull and go
back and forth over that to try blend in
with the yellow okay then after that and
go to this color right here on d23 two
luxe classic shader brush again and I'm
gonna press that
and then we go to the darkest purple on
this brush which is the same brush
legacy take two more so the next step is
I mixed a few Gators together because
avoid its to be like a bit of a mixture
of a few colors I didn't want to just
have one color so I didn't have a didn't
have a yellow glitter so I've got a
yellow pigment from NYX which is more of
a shimmer so I mixed that one and then
had these two glitters from certified
which I love this one's okay these don't
have names it'd just be annoying but
this one's like a purple mixed with Miss
silver and then this is a pink mix of a
gold so these two mixed with the yellow
is how I got this colored glitter okay
well you don't have to do that you can
just you know if you mix any glitters
you want but I wanted to do like a
purple these kind of shows a little bit
pink so in a bit of pink then what a
yellow have done yellow so that's why I
mix a few together so I'm gonna use my
NYX glitter primer I absolutely love
this it's the glitter glue it doesn't
irritate my eyes and it's really really
good so I'm going to surprise on to the
back of my hand like this I've got pink
one on my hands I used it to rub off the
excess of the shadow so I'm gonna use my
Sigma short shader a 20 brush and I'm
gonna first of all apply this to my
under eye just in the center and I'm
gonna bring it down as well because it's
gonna press it with my finger and I'm
when did you like an upside down a
triangle on the bottom of my eye I'm
gonna pick up some of the glitter and
I'm gonna apply that they did agree so
yeah we did you an upside down triangle
he's always explaining eyes on the under
eye lil about gonna go back to the
glitter glue and I'm gonna start to just
press this on over that yellow so you
want to press it on you don't want to
rub the ugly long so if you rubbed a bit
of glue on you're gonna take off that
foiled shadow you just want to press
that on and then we're gonna go back to
the glitter again then I'm just gonna
start to press the stone over the top I
don't apply too much I don't want it to
be a bit of scared cuz I still want you
to be able to see that yellow underneath
but it takes a more like a little groan
I'm going to apply it in the inner
corner I'm not going to putting glitter
in the inner corner but I'm going to put
in that shimmery pigment this is the NYX
pigment in the shade oh seven and it has
a really slight yellow finish joy it's
like a white with a yellow tint which
goes well with this look
hey next thing I'm going to do is I'm
going to apply liquid liner across my
lash line the reason why I'm going to
use a liquid liner and not a gel liner
is because if you use a gel liner going
over this glitter which is quite chunky
it's not going to be a straight line
it's going to be so hard to do so I'm
going to use a liquid liner for this I
forgot to say this liquid liner is the
NYX final liquid liner which looks like
this then I'm going to take some gel
liner this is my Maybelline gel liner
and I'm going to use my three-one-seven
Wingo and a brush from zoeva and I'm
going to apply this in my top waterline
I'm also gonna put this gel liner in my
bottom waterline as well next I'm gonna
apply some mascara and when you use my
bad hell bang by benefit I would love it
when I say it I'm trying not to say it
like idiot
next thing is - is I have these random
lashes in my drawer I have no idea where
these came from honestly and I'm gonna
snap two pairs you can use any lashes
you want fluffy lashes whatever lashes
you know we like just anything you can
use anything and I am gonna just put
these two on top of each other before I
stick them on because it's easier than
if you do it when you stick your lashes
on
I'm gonna use my house of lashes eyelash
glue this is the black one so I like to
start by sticking the outer corner and
I'll just hold it there for a few
seconds and press it down and then I
like to move to the inner corner once
it's in the exact position that you want
it I close my eye and I just
press it on the way around make sure
it's stuck so last thing we're gonna do
is put some bottom mascara on I'm going
to use my bad gal pen with scar from
benefit again and I'm gonna put some
lashes
okay so that was a step by step on how
to get this eye look if you guys want to
see more of these videos that we know if
you want to see like a cut crease in
depth or a double cut crease practice
like I said two and a half years ago I
could never even do eye shadows so it's

it so yeah if you want to see more of
these videos just let me know if there's
