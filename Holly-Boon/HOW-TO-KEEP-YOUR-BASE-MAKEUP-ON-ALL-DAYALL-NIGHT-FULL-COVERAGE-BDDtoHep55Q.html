youtube channel if you're new here that
halite when I was fully been welcome to
my channel so today I thought I was
doing in-depth detailed video about your
base and how to get it to last all day
all night no matter what you're doing
and I'm to keep touching up for out the
night and stuffs I mean I always do
tutorials like full tutorials on the
four eyes and the face and everything I
never go in detail about certain things
so I thought this would be a really good
video and I don't do this all the time I
just do this when I go out or if I'm
going out for food I'm going out by hour
if you're from the UK we pull it out out
guys to the club I'm just going to talk
you through step by step what I do
recommend based on skin types guys if
you're only I would recommend trying to
mattifying primer and try and get saying
this oil free if you are dry I would
recommend maybe like a good moisturizer
and like a hydration spray hydration
spray for your base so the first thing I
want to do I'm just gonna lip prep
because my lips are looking at briar
that's Tegan Christian must be so I'm
gonna use my Urban Decay rehab makeup
prep this is that oh so much anyway
moving on so the problem I like to use
is the fenty Beauty profile or primus
has been my favorite for a long time now
and if you guys can see but I've used so
much like that much which is a lot
because you need one pump at a time I
personally don't fill up primers keep my
makeup on so to speak but this primer is
really good for smoothing up my skin and
it makes my skin feel really soft and I
just like the way it looks underneath
foundations so that's why I use it but
it doesn't necessarily keep my makeup on
so yeah like I said if you are oily I
would recommend something that's
oil-free obviously and maybe like a
mattifying primer if you're super oily I
mean I'm William my t-zone but the rest
of my face is pretty normal if you're
normal you can pretty much use whatever
you want really after that I'm just
gonna spray my face with some of the
Mario Badescu facial spray of utter
cucumber green tea you know I rave about
this product all time cuz it really is
so nice so just spray my face a bit of
thaks it's quite refreshing as far as -
okay next thing I'm gonna do
and when I say my translucent powder
from Beauty bakery this is my favorite
power light it's really really good at
making your skin look so smooth I love
this one so much you get no flashback
it's the perfect color translucent it
doesn't actually leave any actual color
that makes sense some translucent
powders say they're translucent but
they're definitely not this is um and
like I said it race smooth smooth skin
makes the skin so smooth look so smooth
I brushed I love it
so I'm going to take my sponge and I'm
gonna set my primer I'm only gonna set
my primer in my t-zone where I am oily
and I'm also gonna set a little bit here
because it does minimize your pores so
yeah I'm not gonna do too much powder
because I don't need a lot if you aren't
with you
then I would apply a little bit more
than me if you're dry you don't need to
do this step unless you want to minimize
your pores you can do the tiniest bit so
I'm gonna just pry some here I get
really oily forehead and I always get a
really oily chin and everyone's like why
did you highlight your chin I'm like I
did in oily let me leave a lot of people
would say it just set in your primer not
make your foundation it cakey no it
doesn't actually makes it go on smoother
some reason I don't know if it's a bit
backwards but it works there are two
foundations that I'm going to suggest
one is good for all skin types I'm one
is probably better for oily skin or
normal skin so the first one is the
funny beauty profile or foundation matte
foundation and this is in the shade 300
this one is so good for photography it
photographs beautifully it stays on my
skin all day all night
it's just Barmes buildable to full
coverage and it's just overall good
foundation if you're oily or normal the
only problem
some people have have with this is that
they break out but I mean I've been
getting breakouts but I don't think it's
because of this I think it's because of
biotin I've been taking but anyway okay
in the other foundation is the Mac
Studio Fix fluid this is one that's
really really good for
all skin types um and it's kind of like
a semi-matte fish I wouldn't say it's
Superman but it is a semi-matte finish
and it's just another one the
photographs beautifully and I really
really love it it's always one that I go
back to so I am actually going to use my
mac studio fix fluid today because I've
literally used my fainting Beauty like
every single day and I kind of want to
switch it up so I'm going to use my mac
studio fix fluid and I'm going to take a
separate sponge to apply this that
applies with a sponge you can use a
kabuki brush whatever you want and this
foundation works well with both yeah
it's a good full coverage and it's a
nice sort of semi matte finish it can
oxidize by the way like this shade is
way too dark
I bought this chamber NARS tan from
holiday so I mean I'm not tired anymore
so I forgot to bring this down the neck
I spent a lot of time pressing my
foundation into my skin I really prefer
using this sponge because I think you
just gives such a better finish when I
use a brush I and I kind of try and buff
it in it I don't know why I just feel
like it looks like it's sitting on top
of my skin rather than actually in my
skin do you know what I mean
whereas with a Beauty Blender or a
sponge the sponge you prefer I think it
just works better but I do spend a lot
of time obviously I'm probably gonna cut
it are this video you don't wanna see me
sitting here press my foundation in my
skin for nine ten minutes but I think
this is another way to kind of stop your
makeup up here in cakey because you
don't want the makeup to stick on top of
the skin you really want to work it into
the skin so we're gonna move on to
concealer my favorite concealer is the
maybe in the eraser I perfect then cover
concealer for full coverage this is a
full coverage concealer and it's so good
and it's this drug so it's really
inexpensive and it's not thick because
not a thick product apply some is under
my eyes and I'm gonna just a prai bit on
the forehead tiniest bit on the chin
just even it out I'm gonna bring this
down the bridge of my nose
so we're gonna just leave that to dry
down for a little bit if you leave it to
dry down when you go to rent out of your
sponge your sponge won't pick up as much
of the product and you'll get a little
bit more coverage okay so then what I'm
going to do is I'm going to take my Mac
130 brush which is this little small
stipple brush I'm just going to blend
the edge of the concealer before I use
the sponge I really feel like this helps
to not get that sharp line of concealer
try sometimes get and then I'm going to
use my sponge spread the rest of the
concealer
I'm gonna leave my nose alone for the
time being and what I'm going to do is
we're gonna set the under eyes and just
the place is where I applied the
concealer you have one sponge for cream
on one sponge for powder that's just why
I always do you don't really want to use
cream then powder then try and use this
for cream again it will just look a mess
so definitely have two sponges one for
cream wants power down so and we need
this one which we use for the powder I'm
going to take my Beauty bakery
translucent powder and we're gonna set
the under-eye and where we applied the
concealer and this powder I like I said
it really smooths out the under I like
kind of gives you that airbrushed effect
and it has no flashback I just saved you
it is Pat this side at how empowered it
and this side of powdered so as you can
see where I pad and it's Reese moved out
the under eye it looks waist move on and
just way nicer than that side so then
I'll do this side close you can see how
it looks okay so can you see that was
crazy right I know
so just seemed you out a bit so you can
see all over my head but as you can see
that powder has just given me the
smoothest on dryer and again it's really
going to lock in your concealer we're
gonna do the same on the chin and I
remember we were around my mouth because
I laugh a lot and I don't want to get
those creases there so this next time
you can either use that translucent
powder all over your face if that's what
you prefer or you can use powder that
has more of a color to it for the rest
of your face which is what I like to do
so I have this Mac Studio Fix powder in
the shade NC 43 and I will always powder
on top of my face
if I'm going out and want the makeup to
last all night or if I'm going out for
the day and I want makeup to last all
day so I'm gonna take this big brush
from it cosmetics which is my favorite
brush for this and I'm just going to
press this powder into the rest of the
skin just to really set
in place using powders in supper creams
is crucial if you want your makeup to
last I don't care what anyone says if
you do not powder your makeup your
foundation will slide around it will go
patch it won't last
it just won't you need to powder your
powder your makeup this come out really
wants me up it just keeps going in out I
was like different color settings I
don't know what the hell it's doing I am
just gonna blend out my nose concealer
then what I like to do is I bring my
powder up the sides of my nose and leave
it to bake for a little bit just give me
that
reverse contour kind of effect so I'm
just gonna bronze up a little bit I'm
gonna use my dark deep mineralized
skinfinish by Mac and this fluffy brush
from Sigma is a large powder f20 brush
so at the moment my face is looking very
matte a matte but don't worry we're
gonna bring my skin back to life soon I
just have to do this to ensure that my
makeup lasts okay so I'm gonna do I'm
gonna do my lip color on camera because
why not so flip by that i'm going to use
my morphe lipliner in the shade sweet
tea
then I'm gonna take my dose of Cana
supernatural liquid lipstick
and then I'm going to add some glass I'm
gonna use my butter gloss from NYX and
shave my the line so I'm just gonna
contour a little bit and just feel like
I need to choose to a tiny bit so I'm
gonna use my Anastasio contour kit
powder one I'm using the darker shades
the light to medium okay I'm gonna just
go my head cuz I've got a twenty five
finger forehead it's okay just under the
cheekbone
oh my jawline okay so like I said my
skin is looking very matte so I need to
bring my skin back to life a little bit
it's looking a bit flat we're gonna
highlight I'm going to use my Oprah
Rodeo Drive highlight on and my Sigma f
o3 okay so for the last step I'm gonna
use my Urban Decay all nighter setting
spray this setting spray can I tell you
it is so good this will set draw makeup
and it will last
I even had enough okay I don't know any
nothing makeup that was a one-off that
was a one-time thing because I needed
know and I was going out so I wanted to
come to make one anyways discuss it all
night anyway I took a nap in my makeup
and I'd spray this in my face I woke up
my makeup look exactly the same exactly
the same I was like oh my god this
setting sprays live so definitely
recommend this set is brave I also
really recommend using the setting spray
as well because one you'll keep your
makeup on and two you really have the
power to sink into the skin and just see
that you don't have any excess powder on
your face but yeah that is the finished
routine that's something that I make
sure that I do every single time I know
that I want my makeup to last I do these
steps and it really does work I don't
have to top my makeup art I don't have
to touch up with powder I don't have to
do anything my makeup wallet she lost so
and I mean if you are really oily you
might have to take a powder out of you
and just powder certain areas where you
get a bit shiny but overall your makeup
should definitely stay on it went slow
