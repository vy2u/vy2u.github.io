actually going to use the soft ochre
Paint Pot by Mac and everybody goes on
about this and every time we're going to
go and get it it's always been out of
stock and store so I went there
yesterday to get some foundation and
they had in stock so I'm excited to try
it because everyone knows one about it
so I'm just going to apply this using
the mac 242 brush
so once you've applied your eyeshadow
base I'm going to be using the Too Faced
stylist palette so the to face basis
money palette and so first of all from
my transition shade my is a bit messed
up the palette for ages but for my
transition transition color I'm going to
be using this shown here called minimal
and I'm just going to take a tapered
blending brush which is one by beard
space as well when you do eye makeup
first is going to be your face but you
don't have to be as neat because all
this area here is going to get me like
wiped away anyway so you have to be as
careful so now I'm going to go in with
this darker shade here called girls
night and the his brush is from Bluebell
and I'll link them below spies when you
get them and I'm just going to apply
that in the crease
then I was going to go back to this
blending brush that I used for the
transition color and just go into that
just to blend this two shades together
now take my back tooth with to brush I'm
going to take this shade here you could
show your girl I'm just going to apply
that all over the lid now we'll apply
the winged liner and yesterday I want to
picked up the Maybelline gel liner
because it is uses ages ago and I really
really liked it and then I lost it so
I'm going to be using this so yeah it's
called the eye studio lasting gel liner
so I'm going to be using the winged
liner brush by zebra this is number
three months ever
so now I'm just going to go away through
that using the Mac liquid last liner and
the women in the shop said that Adele's
makeup artist uses this on her because
it's like really black and it's
waterproof so if your eyes run or
anything like that this is the best
product video
but now I'm going to use the Mac
extended pain the scar I'm just going to
apply some to my lashes safe lashes as
always I'm going to be using the House
of lashes eye clinics because as you
don't know these and wife--a so I'm just
going to go over my lash line with the
lot liquid last liner just to make sure
there's no white glue or anything film
is moving onto my face - probably buddy
use the smashbox
pore on the water side foundation today
i'm going to be using the Mac Studio Fix
fluid this is in shade NC 37 and I'm
actually going to be using the Mac this
oval brush
everyone's going on about I'm really
really want to try it it's called the
oval six brush
okay I think we're really not as brush I
think it's worth the money it's a
game-changer I thought this is a
game-changer
so now if we can see it I'm going to use
the Maybelline fit me concealer I know I
always use this container but is my
absolute favorite
they're just going to set up with my
laura mercier translucent setting powder
you
so to walk my face and videos the map
give me some bronzer and this is one of
the brushes from the real techniques
range
hey guys I'm really excited to see this
but for contour today I'm going to be
using the Taylor blue contour kit now
this she the first like lot that she
bought out I know they sold out straight
away so these are being released against
shortly and I'm super excited to try
this if you don't know who she is
then you should know who she is but
she's the owner of hot miss clove M and
she just wore a tap on tool kit so
excited to try it you get three
highlight shades and then three contour
shades down here so I think I'm going to
take this shade here which is number
five and I'm going to take this stipple
brush from Bluebell
hi I'm so impressed with this role done
Taylor this is so good I absolutely love
it I'm going to take this shade here
which is number two with my locks and
highlight brush by the way if I'm just
going to set my own bar over there just
to brighten up my under eyes
I'm just going to finish off my eyes so
taking the Stardust pay again I'm just
going to take that dark shade they're
called girls night and just apply that
under my eye then I'm just going to
replace the mascara so my bottom lashes
using the Mac extended play mascara okay
so now for highlighter so just quickly
sprayed hug but for our shooting the mac

mosaic shimmer block and mix these two
shades together
