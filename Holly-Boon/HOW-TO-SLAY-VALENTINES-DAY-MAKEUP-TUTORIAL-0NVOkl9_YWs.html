shape tape concealer webpart and boosted
my eyebrows the benefit goof proof brow
pencil and I actually prefer the
precisely brow but I ran out so I use it
on instead and the precisely brows gives
me an a bit more of a natural eyebrow
this one's a little bit more for defined
eyebrow I feel like I am so excited to
use this palette I don't think you guys
understand that I only just played for
so long and every time I went to get it
was out in stock but beautybay recently
bought it back in stock and I am so
pleased I was on there straight away I
was like I need to get it and so thank
you to the girls you tweeted me and told
me it's back in stock because you really
hooked me up

the shade this palette is literally
beautiful I can't wait to use it so
excited this is my first time using it
so I'll let you guys know my doors and
but it's a lot bigger than I thought it
would be like the pans are a lot bigger
and I don't know why I thought it would
be a lot of small and it's actually
really heavy so first of all I'm going
to take my diffused crease brush by
Sigma which the e30
eight brush thing we're going this right
here which school are you kidding me are
you kidding me not kidding
and you kitten are you kidding me I'm
going to go into this first I'm just
going to go straight in I suppose the
crease
I'll actually come hang out excited our
butts but it not obviously I've wanted
for so long and every time I want again
it's been help stop I'm so late on
things I don't want anything like I
never know when things are racking stuff
I always like I'm so late on everything
I'm going to go with this shade here

going to say Valentine's Day and I'm
going to use the same brush mode is used
and when I apply this shade in the
crease
hashtag slay the out of Alan times

together I'm going to take my airbrush
blender brush which is from Sigma the
s63 this is got nothing on the brush I'm
just going to go over that to make sure
they're blended together and ice cream
so we go with wine and dine next this
red shade here burgundy pinky red to
love it so much if I'm going to go
inside now and I'm going to use my
blending e36 brush by Sigma again I'm
just going to focus in the create and
all the way in the crease like all the
way here and then all the way out here
oh wow these hoes are really pigmented
I'm actually really like I kind of knew
it'd be good but I was still a bit like
um I wonder if it is over hi partner
this light is actually really good I'm
just going back there's a bit of that
hashtag shade that orange it on top of
this this will make sure that it blends
nicely you guys follow me on instagram

on YouTube because I can actually sit on
there and answer questions for a long
time and I plant your question not done
and there's you down to wait for the
video to be uploaded to see the critic
question answered if that makes sense
I'm excited to use these spoiled
shutters as well I just watched you on
your hands look at this
oh my god and obviously off it just
money favorite pilot guys I've just
decided right now this is my new
favorite palette I love this my camera
keeps going out of focus I'm really
sorry I do apologize I'm going to get a
new lens because my camera is a
dickhead I'm really hungry
I really want to get analyze you don't
really understand I really want one
I'm going to go get one watch this video
I'm going to go from it's almost like
this I'm going to Grayson with the laws
with my eye makeup of Muscle Beach for
we clown with this choker on watch me go
you can open search actually on dude
okay so I'm just going to darken up a
little bit but I kind of want to focus
it on or the outer part of my eye I want
to bring it all the way in or do i okay
not I do I want to bring all the way in
then we're talking off with slightly and
I'm going to take shade teddy bear which
is this Jonas on this same brush that I
just used for the pink this shade is
this Russian sticky 36 I'm sorry teddy
bear so again now I'm going to focus
this in the crease go and bring it all
the way in I don't want to apply too
much of this color because it is very
dark and I am i darken up slightly so
this start moves a little bit put up and
then I'm going to build it up guys and
random is a little bit of hashtag on
this branch hashtag slay Valentine's and
you have me on Twitter on you watch this
video just tweeting me going hashtag
just doing the hashtag slave online
taking a little bit more of that dark
shade and I'm going to focus it more in
the back corner okay we're now going to
cut the crease okay what we gonna do
we're going to cut it cut it cut it
means less heart-shaped tape concealer
in shade light/medium it's going to put
a little bit of this in the back of my
hand and apply it with my mac 242 brush
okay so for this color here think of it
like this shiny shoe keep your license
so I'm grinding my shape to blue highway
on this brush
it feels right turn around that edge out
you don't need to look harsh because do
backwards and forwards motions over that
line this process already got product on
it so we'll just blend that out
okay so one way to do now is I'm just
gonna line my lash line it with some
slack line up I'm gonna use the wicked
gel liner from Sigma tips like this so
I'm just going to apply this on my lash
line just helped when you put your false
lashes on through it then burn in think
I might add some glitter so I need a
little bit I'm going to take this do i
this eye duo from doe supplies into in
shade shell it's just like a pinky
agarose Goldy type that are
yes to the guitar okay so the last I'm
going to use are the queen bee lashes
microfi lashes and which look like this
I've already used them once so I just
quickly teamed them I'm going to start
off with the hemp stripper moisturizer
Prime
I'm going to use of two primers actually
we use a moisturizer first of all and
when I take some of the benefit as a
full sessional to minimize our forces
going to apply some loose in the center
of my face
so for foundation when you use the NARS
sheer go in Syracuse medium / dark one
and I don't I place a Sarah Sarah Pugh
Sullivan okay a diet guy so just me I'm
so mean is this don't worry I still love
the Owls a stick foundation but it's a
little bit too light when I'm just I'm
so yeah I'm gonna use this today so I'm
clear dots on this around my face so I'm
asking to get this new iconic London and
device brush type thing throw it your
reminds me of like a tangle teezer I
like the way it is it's it's you like
this I'm going to try this today they
said me and I really try it it's like a
really smooth brush so let's see how
this goes and we need to stab in my
foundation
you
Wow I really like that it's pretty good
Thank You fellow he's so quick what's up
so so cool a little bit there might be a
bit tangle teezer I'll just start to
shape a bit and stuff
hold on who you up your eyebrows
great I up my eyebrows okay just
the tip don't tie them around your
eyebrows with this okay but awesome that
is really good actually
really impressive this brush I'm really
impressed with this brand at the moment
I mean when they first came out I wasn't
that keen on them I feel like they've
grown and they've improved so much like
I love so much of the products now
before I was a little bit like I did
like them but I wasn't like you I mean
and now I feel like the illuminator draw
it's like unreal this device unreal love
it it also sent me one as well it's like
this shape so I think I'm going to try
and cream contour today I'm blending
with this and see weapons one up so I'm
going to take my tart shape tank
concealer it will wet line when they
said this is like a really good
concealer I like the might lion I've got
one from QVC from the UK and you want to
get this expensive so what the records
on par with the NARS radiant creamy
concealer and this one just I thought
you get more product few money wears
like NARS one runs out so great
which one also adds a little bit more
coverage has a little bit more coverage
in the NARS one
okay so let's cream contour today we can
try out this brush like and let you guys
know what I think I like the foundation
one so that's a bunch of religion
foundation so this ties on as well so
I'm we're taking where a mossad you've
ever use cream contour kit and these are
only a few guys amazed but these are
quite hard to like get the color out a
lot that creamy and not that easy to get
product so I like to add them on my
cover FX and custom infusion drops these
are just the two seed plus lemongrass
radius drops I like to drop drop art to
drop Matt I like to apply some leaves in
between my contour shade and mix in it
just constants makes it a lot more
creamy and easier to use in my opinion
so I'm going to take this middle shade
right here yeah this is the light medium
which is a light/medium Wars light the
light palliate sorry
so I'm going to take the light sculpt
the shade light sculpt and I'm just
going to apply a little a couple of
drops of these in there as well so to
apply my punch I'm actually going to
just use my mac 242 brush
okay so let's try this brush and iconic
London and see how it work okay quite
like this brush sometimes I put up with
things like this it can it can make it
go a bit patchy or whatever but look I
just brush yourself it really don't send
it in I'm really quickly not that I
really know far really impressive done
okay cons and you did good you did good
with that we're going to step around
rather Laura Mercier translucent powder
okay so when I go in with some bronzer
and I'm going to use my Chanel Soleil
conditioner
Rosa it's a cream bronzer that day it is
quite pricey but I've had this fight a
year it's over a year and literally look
I still got product what I do is like
from a rush in like this and apply it
with a stippling brush and this is a
really really good I love this wedding
on holiday enough what a retard face and
my foundation isn't matching them like
on what I'm going to use so any should
just apply little bit of this all over
my face and it just gives you that ring
article away from stuck so yeah it's
really good it's expensive but I will
ask you for ages
it'll take you a while to get for it I'm
going to take my powder contour kit by
on the sides of every Hill and the
lights medium high and I'm going to take
this darker shade here and again I'm
going to take my simple brush and I'm
just going to go over four o'clock cream
contour
next I'm going to go and go in with some
blush and when I take this pan which is
infatuation by makeup geek I don't have
to use these other ones anymore I you
see what that's right the console states
on tongues grab it patchy and I don't
really like pink pink blushes so I think
you're going to use this one but you can
buy this on its own and I'll link it
below if you want together with these
pounds already
right really good price as well a huge
okay I'm going to finish off my makeup
so I'm going to go and do my under eye
now so first of all I'm going to go in
with shade hashtag so this orange shade
here on my which is rush or shader brush
by Sigma and when I run this under white
under my lower lashline or try and get
as close to the lash line as possible
without himself in there I'm
bringing it all the way along as well
and I'm suddenly join up the edge here
okay so after that we're going to go
into shade wine and dive
it's retro here and apply that as well
using the same brush right so again I
want to keep this even close or
somewhere else on the nail will shed
real close so I'm going to take this
buff and bread finally found it I'm
going to take a little bit of hashtag on
this brush and just run that underneath
just make sure that those two shows
blend together okay so after that I'm
going to go in with mascara my bottom
lashes and we'll use the L'Oreal
telescopic this one for me is works
better from when our lashes off a
highlight we're taking my other side
you're going it and we'll make shade
summer
so for my lip color I'm going to take
dose of colors liquid lipstick and shade
