video about new products that I
discovered I'm probably late on this
because I'm late on everything I'm one
of them people someone gets hyped after
them I'm so late on the bandwagon that
I'll issue by like six months later so
I'll probably late on this products
you guys probably like where the
have you been but I have recently
discovered this and it's like changed my
life obsessed so this is my hairline at
the minute I've just scraped my hair
back in a ponytail this is not the
easiest way for me to show you how I do
this and so I've disgraced my hair back
and as you can see here I have like
thinning out hair which is like these
little bits of hair here which rests in
an L and my hairline is okay like I
think we had is quite straight but I do
like to split in my hairline when I was
snatched somewhere paint Alex clashed I
like my hairline to look smashed so
basically I used to fill my hairline in
with eyeshadow black eyeshadow and you
can do that but it just takes so long I
just keep them and like this eyeshadow
and it has like bend into your hairline
I feel like you can kind of see whether
you can kind of see where the eyeshadow
is so I found this route and this is the
l'oreal black instant root concealer for
a magic retouch i knowes Protestant out
for ages and like i said i'm probably
late on this but this is amazing like
I've already got through one bottle and
opposed to buy another one and I bought
another one as well because this is just
a game changer that a claim explained so
I'm going to show you what I do this is
my hairline now and like I said it is
pretty much but it's quite neat but then
also when my roots grow out it kind of
like it excited because it looks lighter
here and see I'm going to show you how I
snatch my hand we've described it's
thick so this does come in two loads of
different shades but I've blonde brown
different change blonde I've got loads
of this whatever and also when I have my
hair down the middle part in I also
spray it down the middle on my part as
well just to make my pie look super
snaps as well so yeah you probably to be
honest you're better off doing this
before you do your makeup if you're
going to have your hair like this if you
can have a snaps pony do your pony tail
first and spray this before you do your
makeup but I've redone my makeup so
we're going to deal with it but it can
go on your forehead and stuff so you
have to be careful and yeah it's little
spray zhing here which is good quick
controls put it quite well and so you
give it a good shade at this and then I
think she's going to fit in my hand I'll
show you whether it's like if you're so
happy not to get it on my makeup so yeah
definitely do this before you do your
makeup okay so as you can see I have put
some on my forehead so I'm just going to
take my sponge and just try and get rid
of that little bit right here as well
and this one here's one which I be
really careful of my makeup but so as
you can see that my hair I just look so
much more neat where did I be spinning
out bit of hair hair and sprayed it in
with this product and a sick sick so you
know where to take a look and it was
spoolie brush and just brush the head
back and then brush the product through
the hair as well because you don't want
to patches of the product and then you
can see it also where you've missed it
this is also amazing when you don't want
to dye your hair like when you can't be
asked to dye your hair
this is also amazing because when you
get up to dynaroo you can just spray
your roots see ya then I'm just going to
take my hair spray just spray that so
it's safe so yeah that entire snaps my
hairline and that's I've been doing it
for the last of like three weeks and
I'll be like so obsessed with this
product and it should get free lease
like there's no tomorrow and yeah if you
just want to quickly fill in your
hairline you want your hairline to looks
nice with your ponytail
and you don't want to sit there and fill
it inviting for ages then this product
is so good I don't know how much it is I
think it's pretty about seven rounds I
think it's like seven pounds I'm not
sure Barney yeah blows girls want to get
it obviously make sure to give this
video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it
please subscribe and yeah - it's a quick
little video on how I snatched my
hairline so I hope you guys enjoyed it
