with Sigma to show you an in-depth
winged liner tutorial I've actually
never done one of these before I'm
really excited to film this and
obviously I'm using my favorite Sigma
gel liner in the shade wicked and I'm
going to use my winged liner brush the
eo6 one you already know happens like
this I've been using this for over a
year now it small time favorite liner so
you already know I think a lot of people
struggle with winged liner it's many
things it's everyone's eye shapes so
different you kind of have to manipulate
it and play around a bit on your on your
eye and see what looks best for you but
I will show you what I do for my eye
shape so the first thing you want to do
is you want to create a straight line a
lot of people get this part wrong and
they create kind of a curved line you
really don't want to create a curved
line because if you create a curved line
it's going to make your eye look droopy
and I'll something not what we want when
I looks much either Dec snatched
unlifted you don't when your eyes look
droopy so yeah you don't want to create
a card line you want to make sure the
line is straight I use a glide I kind of
go from the outer corner of my eye
towards the end of my brow and that's to
kind of up the guides I use and we're
just going to create a line from the
outer corner of my eye towards the end
of my brow so you really want to make
sure that line is nice and straight like
I said if not if you make a slightly
curved your eyes are droopy next thing I
like to do because I have a fold in my
eye here and a flap of skin here hangs
over a little bit I have to kind of like
make sure that they are to do more of a
straight wing because if I go down like
that and I kind of make it more of like
a and flipped up wing it will just
enhance that more and also I don't know
if you guys have ever noticed when you
do your winged liner you look down at
that and it's nice and straight then you
look up and it looks wonky it's pretty
because you have creases in your eye
and you kind of have to try and
manipulate your liner so that when you
open your eye it still looks straight
isn't it wonky so what I like to do is I
have to go for a straight way my cursor
because of that reason and I can't have
it quite thick at the end here because I
like to go over where that crease is
that I'm going to just pull back I find
it easier to do this then go this way
and pull the product this way it just
makes a lot easier fine so yeah I'm just
going to go from that tip and I'm just
going to it down towards my okay so as
you guys can see when I look down at
that it looks straight it's just a rock
pile at the moment but it looks pretty
much straight then when I open my eye
cause I have this crease in here it
creates it makes it look a bit wonky so
this is what I want wonky when one
happens so what I like to do is I just
open my eyes I keep checking and then
I'll just keep going in here well that
creases in my eye
but Slough of skin is and just filled
out the pull up slightly I tend to make
it a little bit thicker and then I'll
just keep trying to add to it to make it
look basically you want to play around
with it and just try and make it look
more straight when your eyes with them I
mean well explain I think you guys get
like me I don't bring my liner all the
way into the school in the corner of my
eye because because if you put black all
the way into your inner corner here of
your eye is going to make your eyes it
closer together so I tend to just leave
stop my liner where the start of my
lashes are which is about there I like
to go over a little bit of product at a
time this process also really goes this
0/6 brush because it's so tiny it's
really really easy to control the
product and yeah it's just a lot a lot
easier to use I find so I read of this
rush I use these occur quite a big when
liner brush like runways are any big
ones and it's like a brow brush but I
definitely prefer this small tiny one
see oh it's just about playing around
really everyone's eyes I'm see different
the different eye shapes there's
different styles of liner that you can
do some people prefer their line and
we'll flicked up or firm one well I have
to have my more stripes for this reason
and VA just depends on everyone
I what works best for you but it's just
sitting down and just playing around
with it and seeing what works for you if
you have hooded eyes and again you're
going to have this fold of skin at the
end here you're going to have to keep
trying to manipulate it you can kind of
make an illusion of a different line a
lot of people will take their wound on
at the house widget eyes and kind of do
a lot more of a curved line that way
like so and then it gives the illusion
when you open your eyes that it's
straight again it's just about playing
around with it obviously and seeing what
works for you so yeah I also have a
little bit of creasing and here what I
will notice is if I look down it looks
straight and over my eye and it looks a
little bit wonky there so again I just
take a bit of product and I just go keep
my eye open and just fit it in as I see
it another thing I'll say don't close
your eye when you try and do your wing
don't run out and try and you realize
always keep your eye open
I have everything like that when you
deal with so try your eye that will get
should be so difficult I also just take
some of this liner and apply it to a top
waterline see I love this winged liner
as you guys know IV this for forever
I just love it I did like the in gotcha
liner in some 7by transfers on me so I
plugged in my liner and then it will
transform to run it and this little
brush is just so good to get right in
the little little details which is
really how to I find I find the smaller
brushes easier to use when you're doing
your window and actually just do a
little bit at a time just have to be
patient with it because when line art is
difficult so I just put some lashes on
off-camera and but that is the finished
window a tutorial that's hiding a winged
liner I just helped you guys out a
little bit I still struggle to do more
and I know I find it so difficult
I literally sometimes would have no
patience and like I can't even do this I
thought yes of a lot of patience you
have to do it and it's just about
sitting down and playing around your eye
shape and just seeing what works best
for you and like I said if you've got
any files in your eyes and you slap some
skin to make sure you're not a liner
look funky we
I just got to sit down and manipulate a
little bit and just play around and see
what you can do but that is how are you
more inclined up I do have a discount
code whose Sigma which is wholly Aegis
Holley and you get money off I highly
recommend of vo6 winged liner brush
because it's so tiny and it's pretty
good to do little details and it's
really easy to control the products
because it is this morning you do a
little bit at a time and I really
recommend the Sigma gel liner because it
doesn't transfer it's really black and
it's matte and it works really well so
you get a little part of it last year
long time I think of many well actually
they can see the bottom line now I use
it I let you alter and I'm Bo I hope you
enjoyed it please give me thumbs up
please subscribe and I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
