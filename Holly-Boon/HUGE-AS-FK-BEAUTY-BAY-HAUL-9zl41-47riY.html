beautybay haul like I ordered a lot so I
have a huge box here um I've just like
makeup and just yeah just makeup so
we're gonna go through it all do some
swatches see what's in here
not gonna lie have opens a couple of
things because I just couldn't help
myself so I have I've got a couple of
things but yeah so the first thing is on
the top is three of the original beauty
vendors they just do this like really
cute summer fling
package where you can get three sponges
in here and I don't know I just picked
it up so I just thought like I haven't
used to beat you better in so long I
always use the single ones I think it
was like just like a lot cheaper to buy
three in a set rather than by three
individuals I just thought I'll just get
three in set and but yeah these are like
the summer ones so they're like alumina
like the bright color systems like
bright yellow but orange and bright pink
but yeah just thought I'd get some in
them because like I said I haven't used
the beat vendor in salem's and the next
thing I put in be basket was this pure
contour diaries um I don't know this
cream wears is creamy more I don't know
let's just open it I love this packaging
but it's like marble rose gold I love
that oh guys it's a powder contour kit I
think I just picked this up because I
swear I've had people talk about this
before I picked up this which is a
powder contour kit I don't even remember
innocent I'm not gonna lie up it's so
much stuff in my basket I thought even I
walked in there but anyway and picked up
this which is like a powder contour kit
so about the shades like that it's got
the banana shade and I really like the
contour shades I mean this one's for me
a bit too cool for me but the other
Taylor perfect so I'm really excited to
try that I also like as a mirror on this
side as well it's really cute I've never
seen a mirror on the side before like
that I really like that it's in the next
thing I picked up was the violet Foss
and Laurel relief had it
I noticed have been out for like so long
but I never got it when it first came
out so I wanted to purchase it I love
the colors in it it looks really nice so
okay pick this up just gonna open it and
show you guys shades it like I already
have the violet boss Holy Grail palette
and I did like it when I first got it I
loved it I loved that palettes so much
and then it got stolen
let's not even get into that anyway go
stolen and then Imogen got me another
one for my birthday and yeah it just
wasn't the same as the other one it was
really weird like it just wasn't the
same
I don't know why I don't know if there
was I don't you batch or something I
have no idea if anyway I just thought oh
tries for it anyway because I do love
the shades in it I do love violet what I
think is such a good brand so here are
the shades in the palette I love the
variety of shades in this palette I feel
like it's a really good palettes I have
on the go I was like a staple part and
it's got a couple of safe what colors
you got the green I was a really love
this color here but um it has got quite
a lot of foiled shades in it I feel like
I probably would use that many photos
but I mean it's such a gorgeous probably
I'm obsessed I love love love this shade
right here which is like orange yellow
I'm gonna do a couple of swatches and
show you guys but I'm gonna swatch that
one cuz I love that oh yeah they're so
pigmented
they're so pigmented that's with one
swipe love that okay then I'm gonna
squash the shade bitty oh yeah she's
nice love that so that's a much shade
ragamuffin don't even saying that right
but yeah it's a nice palette I really
like the shades I mean I love the yellow
I love the green I love that it's got
quite a lot of variety ins palette I
feel like you can create quite a lot of
looks with this so yeah I'm really
excited to try this pan out I am
probably gonna use it in a tutorial you
already know but yeah I got so one of
this stuff is from eBay so I'll just
link everything below if you guys when
you get any of it but yeah I'm super
excited to try that palette if you guys
already have it let me know how you feel
about it but I just love the shades and
I'm a huge fan of Laura Lee I love her
so and yeah I'm really excited to try
that anyway next I picked up this over
out this is the highlight sash bronzer
on the go magnet
I'm late on this absent so we use it and
I'm like every single time people use it
I'm like I need that I need it and I
always forget to buy it oh my god I
can't even deal these are just I love
Oprah highlights if you never try to go
for highlight then you need to try one
because they are so a bond therefore we
got one of the best highlighters out
there honestly I love them so much I've
actually got Nicky Torres collab with
Oprah on at the moment which I'll show
you in a minute it's in this a box but I
just can't help myself I had to try it
today it's so nice and you guys if
you've never tried it Oprah highlight
you really should try them so yeah
picked up this palette okay so yeah
we're gonna give this one a little
swatch and see what it looks like this
looks this looks so good oh my god this
is like my kind of highlight it's like a
really light gold it's not too yellow
it's not too like rose it's not your
pinky it's like the perfect gold it's
like a champagne color that is oh my god
I can't wait that is so nice I love I
love that and then I want to swatch this
one right here which is more of a rose
gold look at this one I love that so
much if you like more of a rose gold
highlight and that one's perfect for you
I personally would wear that one because
it's more it's more like a champagne ego
which is kind of about the highlight
that I go for but that one mmm
that one is so nice I love that and then
these ones are just oh my god that's so
nice
okay that one is just like a mixture of
a few so you can kind of if you want
like a really really light highlight if
you're quite fair skin and that shade
there is perfect for you I don't know if
they did that shading like a big pan
because I'd be perfect and then I've got
that darker one there if you're a bit of
more of a darker skin tone and that
one's going to look gorgeous like so and
then pick up this Milani
strobe light highlighter in the shade -
I used a Milani foundation agency I
think it was like a I hope know what it
was but the shade range for me was just
way too orange and way too yellow and so
I just couldn't find a shade to match me
in the foundation so
and yeah but I do love this brand I love
this packaging and it's really nice I
like the print in the highlight it looks
gorgeous um so yeah let's just squash
this this again is more like a champagne
gold which is the highlight so I tend to
go for yeah that's really not it if you
don't want to get the over laughter like
this one might be cheaper maybe I bet
this one is probably cheaper cuz Milania
I like it is affordable brands if you're
looking for a cheaper one this one is so
nice so this is in the shade number two
which is like a champagne e gold so next
we have the nikkietutorials over
highlights these were actually sent to
me these these highlights the other day
and I was like oh my god oh so the
one I have on at the moment is called
glow goals which this is this is the one
that have one now and I want to set this
is this shade of the one I've got on at
the moment and I do another swatch VA so
this one is more of a rose gold I did
see I'm quite because I put blush on
when I put the rose gold and it looked
really nice but sometimes when I don't
wear blush and I use a rose gold II
highlight it can look too pinky on the
skin but today looks fine because I put
blush on so it looks really good and
then you have these other two which I'm
gonna swatch for you so you have a light
I want in a darker one so let's give
these and it was swatch and see what's
what so so the lighter one is called
glazed donut so this is the shade they
so not so this is going to be perfect
perfect for you if you have light skin
so basically the one I just said about
in the book the light one this is
basically a big pan of that one I feel
like this is very light so this is going
to look so bomb on anyone that's got a
light skin so wow oh my god that is so
nice I feel like you know you want to be
extras some days I feel like I
would add a tiny bit of this in my
highlight and also this in the inner
corner of the eyes on the brow bone hmm
so this one is for darker skin I mmm
this one on the body I want to use it on
my body I love this shade this is in the
shade blind the haters I'm going to do a
swatch for you
so that is the shave line the hate yes
yeah if you've got darker skin it's
gonna look gorgeous on you it's gonna
look amazing
that is amazing that's so bomb so next I
picked up the zoeva vegan prime brush
set this is ten brushes and a clutch I
feel like I have so many makeup rushing
it's agreed don't need anymore but I'm
I'll be completely honest with you I'm
lazy and I can't be able to wash them so
instead of washing them I buy new ones
it's a problem you should stop being
lazy the reason why I got the Weaver
brushes difficult at first I do too but
I used to use though evil brushes all
the time I love them like they are they
were just such good brushes and they're
so affordable so I said why did I ever
sleep in rushes every night so I thought
I'd get some water this is it this step
that I've got so about 10 brushes we've
got a few eye brushes it's a face so
we've got D so we have a 2 to 3 which is
petits eye blender is quite dense brush
that is going to be really good for
blending out kind of like when I when I
apply shadows to the outcome of my eye
it's gonna be really nice to blend with
that there was what the two to six
running it out
if so then we've got the two to six
which is just smudger brush that's gonna
be good for smudging out eyeliner if you
want to make you look almost so as to be
good for applying shadows underneath the
eye and kind of smoking out this would
be really good for that so that's the
number two to six and then this face
shape brush this is the 110
again this is quite a dense brush it's
like a round brush it's really nice it's
really soft and really I'd be good to
kind of like buff out your concealer
under your eye or kind of pressing the
concealer and buff out the edges that'd
be really really good for that also be
quite good to blend out your contour as
works it's quite a small brush so it's
quite precise so I'd use it too for
buffing my concealer or to buff in my
contour so yeah that's the one ten face
shape brush and
oh this is a concealer buffer its next
one okay so I bring is his face shape
one just for my contour and then I've
got this one which is the 142 concealer
buffer which is basically the same as
that other brush but a lot of smaller
yeah this one would be perfect for under
the eye spots in the concealer I feel
like I haven't bought my concealer in
for like forever
I wish use a sponge now but I might go
back to do and actually used to but
Micah senior in and I did like the
finish of it oh my god I used to love
this brush and I still love it now
are you so use it for my eyebrows okay
so this is the three-one-seven a winged
liner brush from zoeva angled angle
synthetic brush at there and honestly
this brush used to be my ride-or-die for
eyebrows it's so good for eyebrows if
you want if you using the pomade this is
like because it's so thin I've never
seen an angled brush with this then
they're always kind of like a little bit
too thick and it's really hard to
control the product but with this why
it's so thin it's it always gave me such
a precise eyebrow such a sharp clean
eyebrow so if you use pomades which I do
sometimes and definitely try out this
too evil brush three-one-seven because
it's bomb flies so good I swear you use
this and you'll never go back to another
price this one is so good okay so next I
have this brush which is the g27 soft
definer brush and the vegan one and this
is so soft this is like oh my god this
is so soft this would be amazing to
apply bright in the crease and also to
collect Pat on the product the outer
corner of the eye and but in the crease
I like this would be so nice and so easy
to use it's quite flat it's quite a flat
brush which is nice and but it's super
soft and really fluffy so it will really
help to kind of blend in the front also
so yeah I love that so that's the to t7
soft definer brush and then also we have
here the 235 contour shader so this
would be perfect to contour down the
sides of your nose and yeah that's
pretty much all I would use it for it's
to contour down the sides of my nose and
to kind of buff it in but yeah I love
that so that's the two three five
contour trader
we've got three different face brushes
so I love myself Ibuki brush my flat
kabuki brush I mean I love kabuki
brushes so this is the 104 buffer brush
I feel like I've definitely had this
brush before yes and this is like a
really flat kabuki brush and so this is
the perfect preventative foundations if
you prefer kabuki brushes
I love sponges but I do I do sometimes
like using a kabuki brush but yeah
that's what I would use this for and for
foundation also too I could use this for
blended out contour and I thought that
would be really good for that as well
but it's really nice if you like the
Kabuki brush for foundation this one's
gonna be so good because it's so flat
and it's so soft this one is the one to
a cream cheek brush so it's an angled
brush like that it's very fluffy and
personally I probably won't use this for
creams I feel like it's too kind of
fluffy so I personally pretty much
easiest for cream but I would put uses
for powder so I pretty cunning use like
a power to brush on which you can just
kind of press it in like that
or kind of just like buff it in like
that and that's definitely what I would
use this brush for and then next we have
the 1-86 powder brush this is amazing
this brush is so fluffy I would use this
for bronzer definitely or blush bronzer
or blush I would definitely use this for
especially bronzer just kind of like all
over the face like that and then again
just for blush on the cheeks I would
kind of do that it's a bit too big for
blush maybe but definitely bronzer I'll
definitely use this brush to bronze up
my face so yeah that's the 186 powder
brush you could also actually use this
to apply translucent powder all over
your face and just kind of press it in
and that would also work
I'm just gonna put them in a little case
oh it comes with a little case which is
so nice so I'm gonna put the brushes in
here yeah this is the case that you get
powerful inside which is so cute
so I'm gonna put the brushes in there
okay so the next thing I picked up was
the cover FX total cream total cover
cream foundation and honestly I would
try to cream foundation in a long time I
kind of remember the last time we used a
cream foundation so I want you to get
one
I thought they give you so much
conference so if you're looking for like
a really really full coverage foundation
then definitely look for a crew
because creams are always way more
coverage than any G plus 50 is the shade
that I picked up actually I did look at
this the other day when it came iPhone
as well my finger and X always see the
color and I thought the color is pretty
small so yeah I will definitely be using
that in a video and I'll let you guys
know am i doing first impressions on
that foundation so next I think it's up
there's more feet and liquid lipstick I
haven't tried an awfully liquid lipstick
yet so I thought I'd get a few shades
I'm excited I've never tried them so
this is in the shade peanut this
colorful autumn is Miffy I love it it's
so nice yeah this is what the color
looks like
so yeah this color is perfect for when
oh I can't wait to try this I love that
I also loved it it's super pigmented by
the way I don't know how it wears in the
lips but I'm putting into like a full
face of first impressions and I'm gonna
try it
okay so picked up two more of them
morphing equal it sticks in the shade
virgin and brunch so I'm gonna swatch
these for you as well so this first one
here is in the shade brunch is a very
pinky color but I really love that
that's so nice and then we've got this
shade here which is the shade of virgin
and which I'm obsessed with that color
there is a bit of me that is a bit of me
yeah you've got virgin and then brunch
yes these next products I don't even get
a zombie bags I actually ordered these
from the official website because I
really wanted a car key eyeliner so I
picked up these are from Stila this is a
stay all day waterproof liquid eyeliner
right
so I've got the shade teal with the
shade olive and then I picked up this
one which is in the shade Moss because I
just didn't my Walker shade of green I
want it because I'm gonna do is you try
on a look I've got a look in my mind I
want to do so I really need you like a
teal or like a olivey liner so let me
just watch and you just apply these on
my hand that you see what they're like
by nicely like they're not bleeding
that's why I look for when I apply a
liner on my hands as if it bleeds if it
bleeds and no no no no and this one
doesn't so yes to that so this is in the
shade Olive I don't know why this one's
in different packaging which are those
two I have no idea this one is in the
shade
ade most this one's more bucket darker
green yeah so I got the shade teal olive
and moss they don't know which color
green I want is so I just don't get all
three because you can't tell online you
just can't tell online which ones like
the right one so yeah I can't wait to
try that okay so next I picked up the
RCM a translucent powder this is a new
one the translucent one they haven't
done a translucent powder before and
this one is now on beautybay so I did
have the other one which I don't even
know what the shade of it was but it was
very light it was very white and I felt
like it just it to Ashley under my eyes
in it too much so yeah I'm so glad they
came out with a translucent powder
because this palette is so inexpensive
it's very messy yes this powder is quite
messy but I really like this palette and
it's yeah it's so affordable it's so
cheap and you get a lot of product in
here so yeah this is the RCM a
translucent powder I can't wait to try
this if it's anything like the other one
that I will like it because I like the
texture of the powder I just wasn't a
huge fan on the shade of the other
powder
so yeah they bring out a translucent one
which is definitely way more my kind of
color so yes to that okay so next I
picked up from our CMA the concealer
palette this is the number 10 so this is
the shades for the concealer palette so
I have never used a concealer palette
before but I've heard really really good
things about this one so I picked up so
I was like I really want to just try the
palette you get so many concealer shades
in here
I feel super creamy it feels really nice
I just watched a color there so it feels
super creamy that's what it looks like
and I'm putting is like the darker
shades to contour as well because I
Sabrina that's gonna be a really nice
contour I think the perfect mix between
it's not too cool but it's not too warm
so it's like the perfect shade contour
for me so I'm betting to use that screen
contour that looks really good I'm not
gonna be so excited to try that I can't
wait Thanks I just picked up an
Anastasia and clear brow gel because
this is my favorite brow gel all time I
already have one but it's running out
and I've had it for like over a year and
it's only just run out so you know it
picked up another one this brow gel is
like literally my favorite keeps my
eyebrow hairs
in place all day so if you find it hard
to find an eyebrow product that works
for you then definitely try this one
because it's like literally my favorite
my IRA heads don't move all day okay so
next I picked up these violet boss
eyelashes and these are in the style I
need you see what you did there
these are very dramatic but you know me
I'm worried about dramatic I'll add on
anything got everywhere natural
eyelashes I'm always very dramatic ones
so yes I love them most of the packaging
Sookie and I picked up these la splash
lip glosses I've got a couple of these
so I got the shade angelic and the shade
off real which is a tie one at 8:02 so
let's look at the knees I want some nice
clusters so these ignites on the web's
website oh my god the packaging is so
key look at this packaging look at the
top that's a pigmented gloss eyes are
pigmented gloss I wasn't expecting this
because these are very expensive so I
wasn't expecting to be that that
pigmented wow I love that that's such a
nice shade as well yeah that's what that
one looks like so yeah very pigmented
and that's in the shade 802 angelic okay
so as she picked up three so yeah the
next one is in the shade F real which is
number 801 and then I picked up this one
as well which is 807 which is called
gleam I would say like the applique of
this glass I'm going to try it on my
lips and see if it's sticky because you
know me as I like a sticky gloss but so
far doesn't feel that sticky they might
get a little bit sticky but when it's
really sticky I can't do a bit but yeah
this is that one so that's in the shade
F Rio which is 801 that shade right
there can't wait to try these I'm so
excited I can't wait you know this one
is in the shade 807 cooking I've got a
lot of stuff here okay I know I'm sorry
I know I think this one oh look at this
one
oh my god it's like a sparkly bronze
shade oh my god oh my god oh my cold
is so nice this one oh that is so bomb I
can't wait to wear that that's my
favorite one Hubble with them love that
that's my favorite thing out of
everything so far that gloss okay so
from LA girl I picked up the shady slim
a brow pen so and this in the blackest
brown this is a bit like a brow Wiz from
Anasazi Beverly Hills it's the same sort
of thing but yeah I'm gonna try it on my
brows and let you know how I feel about
that so I'm College try that that looks
pretty good and then I picked up from
cover FX this perfect pencil and in a
brown shade i think i think it's fine
huh yeah this isn't a brown in a brown
shade let me just show you second nice
warm bro I like it very nice for in my
waterline and also kind of underneath my
iron and smudge it out and also you can
use as a brow pen so and you can use a
lip liner this is like a universal pen
so you can use it for everything so I
probably would as well uses for lip
liner so lip liner and also fit in my
waterline okay so next from Milani I
picked up the retouch and a raised light
lifting concealer and it's in the shade
medium light which is the shade number
three so let me just undo this just get
this out this is what it looks like he's
got I couldn't it was sponge in the end
yeah it's like a little sponge on the
end kind of like the Maybelline your
razor I okay I stood over Squatch on
this concealer that's a good shades
maybe a little bit too light but that's
good for when I want to brought under
eye that's a good shade I like that
also it seems like it could be quite
good with full coverage I don't if it is
full coverage or don't think it is full
coverage because on my arm it looks a
bit like more like a medium coverage but
I feel like you can build up to full
coverage that's nice it's a nice
consistency it's not too watery
sometimes I find most concealers are too
worried and I can Waurika Xena so that
one seems nice on my skin but again I'm
gonna try it on my face at some point
maybe in a video so then I picked up
this steel art magnificent metals get
around go I already have one of these on
a car remember the shade that I have but
I wanted to pick up another one this is
in the shade bronze though
these are liquid eyeshadows and they are
so oh my god they're amazing I love them
they're like so good yeah this is the
shade bronze Bell which is the one I've
wanted for so long it's always been out
of stock I do it was swatch yeah yeah
this is a liquid eyeshadow and look how
amazing this is I cannot deal like I
said I already have one of them and I
love it so much but this one is like I
can't wait I can't wait see yeah if
you're looking for like a super intense
good after your eye a liquid eye shadow
this one is these ones also I've quite a
few colors as well which is really good
but yeah that's what it looks like on my
arm
I can't wait that's gonna be perfect for
kind of like Christmas time Christmas is
when the glitter comes out my whole face
is gonna be glittery everything is gonna
be getting ready I can't wait okay so
next I picked up the Laura color baked
liquid radiance foundation in the shade
medium guessing the shades online is a
real problem because I don't even know
what's gonna like anyway so it says it's

looking like radiance in a bottle okay
that's a lot that's a lot it claims to
do to use a prior over primer blends
well for flawless radiant coverage
there's a full coverage just looking at
the bottle this is way too pink for me
this this shade and we just okay yeah
that's that's too pinky for me but I
mean this claims to be on law so I
really get this in my right shade and I
realize dry it because it's a it claims
to do a lot so I mean I want to see if
it lives up to its expectations
so yeah that's definitely the wrong
shade it's way too pink for me if
anybody's more kind of this kind of
shade then comment below and I'll give
it to one of my subscribers but you has

this which is a stealer magnificent
metals foil finish eyeshadow and it says
to dab fingertip in eyeshadow mix of a
drop of primer in tray and gently tap
onto lids
blending it out with soft strokes build
intensity with additional layers or mix
multiple shades for a multi-dimensional
effect okay let's see what this looks
like
praise you have a little tray
Isaac you how's it really all about you
apply the stuff that you other years I'm
so impatient when trying to get into
packaging I'm like just opener
it says you have to put this little eye
primer eyes it liquid eye primer so it
comes in this little pot and then it
comes with this little just a little
squeezy thing I don't know equally is so
like you take it out you put it in the
tray dab your finger in it dab your
finger in the eyeshadow and put it on
your eyes so I'm really excited to try
this so I picked up the shade metallic
gilded gold which looks like this I'm
just gonna put a little bit of this i
prime up in the tray and I'm going to
try out on my hand and see how big this
it is so just put a little bit of that
in the tray oh hey that is oh bomb oh my
god can you see this right now can you

gold just chilling on my arm it's
amazing oh my god that's so cool like
use a little primer and then like I used
I don't ha are you seeing this right now
like that is amazing Wow
okay so then I picked up from Stila this
smudge pot in the shape brown eye not
brown gels like creams and stuff with a
minute for my eyes just because it's not
as harsh as black and I just prefer its
it's just like a gel liner kind of thing
in the shade Brown it says it's
waterproof as well which is nice so
that's I kind of use brown line is like
in the long water line I also use it for
a wing and I've been loving it up and
wearing it quite a lot lately
