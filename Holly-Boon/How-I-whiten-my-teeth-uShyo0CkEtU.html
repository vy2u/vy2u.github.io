on how I whitened my teeth and this has
been a highly requested video for quite
a while now but I was still great until
I found a teeth whitening product that I
was 100% happy with before I shared it
with you guys so I did get sent quite a
lot of free teeth whitening kits to try
from doing companies in return for video
if I liked it but I didn't really find
any of them useful I didn't really like
any of them so yeah so I did get sent
this kit from diamond whites and I'm
super super happy with it I've used it
for about two three weeks now and my
teeth upon super super white and they're
not sensitive so yay em video you want
to see how I want my teeth and keep
watching and make sure you give it a
thumbs up if you enjoyed it so just
before we start I am really sorry about
the video quality I'm going to get it
sorted so hopefully by the next time I
film I should have a good camera and the
quality should be really good fingers
crossed so yeah and so first of all you
get this and this activator stuff so
what you do with this is you spray on
your toothbrush you brush your teeth
better before you start doing the
whitening process you want to focus on
the front teeth because they're the ones
are going to be seen the most so yeah
when I spray through toothbrush and
brushes you put this to start I've
already done this previous just to save
some time and then also you get this gum
shield now mine's moldy to my mouth so
what you do is you just get pain gone
shoot and then you want to boil the
kettle or get some really hot water put
these in the hot water then take them
out after like 20 seconds then you want
to bite them so they mulch your teeth
and then put them in a cup of cold water
to then set them so then then mold it
and so then next you get the non
peroxide gel and I've already used you
get two of these I've already used one
and this is a much of got left so how
much you've got that much left some got
it about because I love it so I'm
probably gonna buy it and say yeah you
get there
then you also get this teeth whitening
pen which is amazing so so you're going
out on a night hour and you just want to
quickly top up your white teeth this is
fabulous and punch really wonders than
that yeah you can you basically put this
in your safe and then wait 10 minutes
just to dry and then brush it off and
this is great figure out a night out
useful to put you on your teeth and then
also you get these whitening toothpaste
as well which is really cool and also I
do have a blue LED light that I use for
mine and it was $5.99 you can buy a
separate business you come with the kit
but yeah I would recommend getting that
because it does I feel like it does um
white and the morphe is an LED light not
sure why that is but it just works
better so yeah and see I'm just going to
go and wash my gums because it's got a
lipstick on it from last time which is
and then I'm going to show you how I
want my so yeah we're going to do is get
this gel get this gel and you want to
put it in the gum shield and then you
want to put it in your mouth for this
day Hey
this one okay and then it's the right I
know this enough so I did do every
twenty minutes I used to do it for forty
minutes but because my Tivo quite right
now from doing it quite a few times I've
done it for 20 minutes I hope you guys
found this video useful if you have any
questions please comment below I will
also link the home teeth whitening kit
below as well so you can find it and I'm
sorry I don't have a before-and-after
picture I forgot to take one understand
thing to do it and because I didn't
really think the steep wider was
actually going to work

hope you enjoyed this video and I will
