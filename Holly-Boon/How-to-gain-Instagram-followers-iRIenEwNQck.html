video on how to gain Instagram followers
so I started with around some 300 people
this was like last year and we're going
to have in like a year of making my
profile professional I've managed to get
to fifty five thousand so I'm just going
to share with you guys how I managed to
do that and just some tips to help you
if you want to get yourself out there
get work no makeup known and your skills
knowing your fashion note anything like
that and I'm gonna try and share with
you guys some some tips that could help
you and what we ously I don't have that
many followers compared to some people
obviously some people have a hundred
thousands and like millions and stuff
but as soon as she gets a sort of like
15,000 20,000 they start buying up
really really quick so and yeah so the
first thing I would say is to start
making your Instagram nice and
professional and don't post pictures of
your mom's cats dogs brothers uncles
food because like no one cares about
that
so just literally post about it about
what you'll do is so if you do a makeup
make sure you post those on the make up
pictures and obviously view fashion just
to stick to just posting fashion
pictures and so on and so on
and because if no one cares driving no
one cares what your car so don't post
which will be care no one cares
like people have following you because I
want to see what it is that you do and I
want to take an interest in what it is
that you do so I'll just leave it to
just yourself it sounds like a real pain
thing but Instagram is a very vain thing
hey don't post pictures of don't you
post a picture of your boyfriend don't
post those the pictures with like your
mom and your dad and your brother ever
just literally keep it to just you and I
pressed a couple pictures here and there
with my friends and but I don't tend to
post pictures with family members or any
sent that because I don't really want
people to know about my private life and
also they don't want to be on it eva's
so and yeah try and keep it just about
you and why it is that you
also if you're posting a makeup picture
you're posting an alpha picture make
sure you tag the company so you tagged
the company Tara the products at your
views make sure you tag them that's how
you're going to get noticed also do not
have your Instagram on private that's
pointless I'm just going to see it
because you won't come up on the thing
where you know people like in you can
see what people have liked
you won't come up on there if you're on
private so just divert you on private
and also I would say is to invest money
into buying clothes from Instagram pages
that have loads of followers like and
then that sounds a bit weird but I when
I first I started buying clothing from
my cotton s Club in because I genuinely
liked it I didn't even know anything
about followers at this point and I just
knew that I want to make my more
professional getting to get reposted or
anything like that but why did is a born
outfit from Hot Mess clayvin I bought
out with one from my banjee stress and
things like that and I just tagged them
in the photo and I've got reposted
so I think that's a really good way of
getting yourself out there obviously
those are brands have a lot a lot
following and a lot of people know about
them so obviously you're going to get
yourself seen and so that's a good idea
as well also when you take outfit
pictures if you don't have to have like
a really professional camera but make
sure that it looks nice because I use my
iPhone and I just put it on self timer
like 10 seconds and quickly got Ryan
standing position and that's all you
need to do you just need your iPhone or
ever but don't have like your mom's
we've in the background or like your
date Nick is hanging up in the backdrop
right now you just need to have like a
plain backdrop like just why or just a
plain wall or just something that's just
going to focus on you I'm not a messy
background also make sure you take an
interest in other people that do the
same thing is what you want to do
because eventually when you start
getting more followers you'll get
invited to sort of bloggers events and
things out that way you meet with these
people and it's nice long as you get to
know those people and to like take an
interest in what they do because then
they'll like nine times out of ten like
taking interest in what you're doing as
well so it's kind of like cool like that
then you have a sort of that support
inside thing where you know she's always
gonna like you by who
going to government on your by I do not
remain like um definitely take an
interest in everyone else don't expect
everyone to comment any more pictures
and like a bitches and you don't do it
in return because people walk about ok
she's worried um try to think what else
ok so the next thing I'm going to say is
make sure you try and post one picture a
day and don't just post any random
picture if it's if you don't like it or
if you think oh that's not great or
don't just post a picture just to post a
picture making sure the pitches is worth
posting but try and post once a day
because the more you post and when
you're going to get seen so yeah
definitely try and post once a day I
shot was opposed once a day is a lot
harder than it sounds
getting one good photo every day is so
difficult but as long as you're like
trying to sort of use like have that
your target and you're trying to reach
your target a and because like I said
you're going to get seen more and yeah
ok also make sure that you reply to
people's comments because people won't
ask again
if you don't reply people block she
doesn't reply I'm not going to ask no
question and it's like it's nice to
answer people's questions obviously you
don't be very like someone's asking you
where your top is and it's what you you
takes you two seconds just but I'll go
to from Topshop or all I'm going to from
River Island like don't be rude you not
reply because people will pick up and in
black she's rude
you know what I mean and I still try
reply as much as I can sometimes I miss
missed messages but then people always
start admission to me or people will
always tweet me and things like that and
Twitter is the best place to get an
answer out of me because I I don't have
that many followers on Twitter so my
newsfeed doesn't get really busy so I
always find it really easy to reply on
Twitter so if you everyone asked me a
question just literally ask me on to it
I think that's everything I think I've
covered everything I hope this video has
helped you guys
I'm going to do an updated Iran tutorial
next of things because a lot of you have
asked me to do that and my arms video is
quite quality so yeah I'm going to
do an optical eyebrow tutorial but and
let me know if you want to see anything
else and I'm so excited for us but also
if you're wondering um what kind of this
lipstick is it's dangerous by Mac its we
really matte but it's a really nice
braid I let you wear this like every
year when it's like Christmas time I'm
like yeah but yeah I hope you guys
enjoyed this video make sure you give it
a thumbs up and if I've missed anything
out anything that you specifically want
to know please comment below and I will
answer your question or again tweet me
but yeah are you guys enjoyed it and I
will see you again next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
