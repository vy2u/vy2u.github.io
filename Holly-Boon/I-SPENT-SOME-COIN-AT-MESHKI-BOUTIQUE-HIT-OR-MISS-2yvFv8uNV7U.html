channel and to know if you're new here
welcome hi my name is Holly
so in today's video we're gonna do a
message key amesh
is a mesh key Tryon video which is a
clothing brand that I found on Instagram
assimilated people wearing it and it
looks very nice so I'm really excited
yeah if you liked the video don't forget
the thumbs up or thumbs down whatever
you're feeling don't mind it promotes
video either way so it's up to you and
if you want to see me try on some mesh
clothing thank you watching so the first
piece that I got is this blue denim
dress and it's actually really stretchy
I didn't expect it to be really stretchy
so this is called the Mandana denim
dress and is in a size small it's got
all these loops around the middle so you
could per belt which is Q and it's got
some pockets on the back and some
pockets on the front as well I always so
tip up at the back
yeah I thought this would be really cute
it stays home dress so I'm gonna try it
on and we'll see what it's like okay so
this is what the dress looks like I'm
gonna stand on the base so you can see
it properly but it fits perfect it's
really comfortable
it's like structured so it's not like
really tight and I also love that it
does have these loops you could wear
about if you want it so yeah this is
what it looks like full length I really
like it's just above the knee like I
said like it's really stretchy and it's
just feels really really comfortable and
then at the back it's got like a slur
here what you really like this is that
she's so so confident a region expect
distressed to be this comfortable
because it's like obviously like denim
so I thought it'd be like a bit stiff
but it's like so Pompey I literally
fucking love this ok so next thing is
this really strappy red dress and it's
quite sure and it's really really thick
like this material feels so thick so
it's 100% not going to be see-through or
like you're not going to feel like it's
too thin if it was really good quality
and it also has this belt that has its M
on it which is obviously for mushky the
brand yeah I think this is really cute
I've seen a couple people wear this and
I thought it's really nice and in this I
got a size smaller as well
yeah it feels really really good quality
I'm gonna try it on and we'll see what
it looks like I literally love this
denim I don't want to take it off okay
so this is what this one looks like I
literally love this one as well like I
said it's really really good quality
material like I didn't expect it to be
like this were made if that makes sense
I like that has a really thin straps you
wouldn't need to wear a bra with it's
it's quite supportive like it's quite a
good tight thick material and it's not
see-through and I also like this Belk
cipher kit really it's like really
flattering cuz it kind of just like nips
you in on the waist yeah this is what it
looks like it's a really nice length as
well like I don't know II like dresses
this short but it feels comfortable and
it doesn't feel like it's too too sure
if that makes sense so yeah this one's
definitely a yes from me really
comfortable thick material I love the
belt just really nice really nice I
honestly like this color
he's caught over time actually good yeah
okay so I did get quite a few right
things though you're gonna see quite a
few red outfits in this video and but I
did get this crop top and it's got the M
in the middle and you looks like that
and then I got this skirt as well it's
got the M on it again but it's at the
back so this is the front of the skirt
and it's like a pencil skirt again both
really thick material and feels really
good quality so yeah I'm gonna try it on
and we'll see what it looks thank you go
flowers be girlfriend no you forgot her
birthday yeah that's bad
okay so this top is definitely too small
I always think I can get a smaller top
cause I don't forgot my boobs of that
big so it was good for a small in the
top but hey sometimes it's fine like
somehow smaller than top is perfect then
sometimes it's too small so this is
definitely too small this guy is
definitely like a little bit too big I
feel like it's kind of a little bit
buggy I'm afraid if it was just looking
a little bit tighter and it's obviously
got this detail at the back so the tops
too small and then this guy is a second
a little bit too big
but I do like the outfit I think it's
nice okay so this is what the outfit
looks like fallen I love this skirt I
love the length of it and it's also
wreath it Andrey nice material and the
only thing is it is a little bit too big
which is annoying so it is just like a
little bit of space here I wish it was a
bit tight up
I loved it has this M on the back Alex
you love that and yeah I really of this
type but again it stops too small I
don't need to go size up what do you
guys think let me know okay so next
outfit I got this top which is just like
lace so go with these trousers but I
don't have any nipple covers so I can't
try this on because you're just gonna
see my type awesome wait no no no so
these are the trousers I've got four
buttons on the sides here and there like
cuffed at the bottom so yeah these we're
gonna go with that top but else I'm
gonna work now so I'm gonna try them
with this top just to see what the
transfers look like but obviously this
is not gonna go to the top but you know
anyway okay so this is what the trials
this look like I don't know about these
you know I felt like Eugenie
I felt like Aladdin's genie you know I
mean and I thought when you walk they
just go like this I'm a genie in a
bottle baby then you remember that song
like they look really good on the
website but I don't know about them on
me I don't if they're reading my thing
genie
yeah I don't know if I like them just
cuz I don't know me my they're not
knowing my thing after 20 things don't
mean but I don't know I feel like I
might grow to like them I'm a genie in a
bottle
you better of me the right way pyramid
some some I used to fucking love that
song okay so next is this dress this is
what it looks like it's really silky
it's got like a sheer bit down each side
which is really nice
I think I'm gonna cut that label out
there because you can see it to me the
shirt and it would just annoy me but
this is the Claro dress in a size small
and again it's got these little bits
here that got the M on them okay so this
one I feel like would be nice if you're
going to
like an all-white party type of thing
and it's really shiny I think it would
look better if it didn't have this a
gold bit here I feel like the gold bit I
don't know yeah I don't know for my huge
fans this like gold but here it would be
better if it was like white and then I
don't know about the sherbert either I
feel like I don't know I said I got this
year but yeah I don't know I don't know
about this one
I like if I don't love it I feel like it
could be better but let me know what you
guys think if you like it would you wear
it let me know yeah I don't know about
this one okay so I have another right
dress I know I like so much red stuff
but I just I love bright and this is
like a shiny material I think it's
really nice this is called the Marisa
tie not midi dress it's going in a size
small
and it's like this and then I think you
just tie it and it's got two things that
you tie yeah let me just try on I'm
sorry but explaining things we noticed
I'm the worst person to explain in
anything it's just I mean this one is
really comfortable really good material
like all the other ones they're really
well made and it's shining I do think
this bit like could be a bit like
thicker I just I just don't like having
this pit if I'm being honest I prefer if
it which is a bit like I don't know
covered that but I do like it I do
actually like it so what I feel like
with this one I feel like this is like
Christmas day you're like - Malik I'm
the present
hi it's me I'm the president yeah I
actually like this I like the length of
it I just wish this was a little bit
thicker but I do really like it I think
it's really nice okay so we did get some
swim stuff it's really nice it comes in
these little bags that sends mesh keys
to women in it which i think is really
nice to think sorry nice detail so yeah
I got this full length swimsuit and
there's a khaki green color and it's got
the bell I really really love this they
have this invasive conner statistics so
so nice on the model on the website and
I was like I love that
I actually don't have many swimsuits as
color EBUS so
yeah I'm gonna try this on and show you
guys what it looks like this is the ad
not one piece bikini and car key I will
link all this stuff below anyway in case
you guys want again it's just easy then
just click the link so this is what this
looks like I really really love this I
love the color and of the fit those
really good quality I also like how it's
cut like up here because I'm quite short
so I like that this makes my legs look
longer
Jawad a bikini wax for this video and
they are I really like this this is a
massive thumbs up I think this won't be
perfect if you guys like a pool party so
whilst I bought this swimsuit I'm going
to try on this cover-up this is just
like a white cover-up and it's got a
glaze these heard on the sleeves it's
really really nice again it's a size
small and this is the Torah lace
paneling dust
okay I'm from her really bougie like I
feel really bougie in this one piece and
this thing like yes bitch I need to buy
those fucking flowy has German everyone
used to wear them every we just call it
one prestige for wearing them I actually
like them they don't you suit me though
hats don't suit me it's really annoying
anyway I like this this is really really
nice I love this detailed on the size is
what I was really pretty with definitely
Western holiday with a swimsuit so like
this one or bikini or something okay so
I did get this bikini as well it's good
it's really nice detail on the side and
then on the top part it has this detail
on the straps as well which is really
reaching I really like it and I've just
looked at this and this is no way gonna
fit me it's top so I don't know I'm
gonna try and as long as I already know
this is not gonna bit me and but yeah I
love this I should have got a bigger top
and this I'm so annoyed but I love this
they do this in white is why they have
so many nice swimsuits on there have so
mean I swim series they have so many
nice clothes like this website is just
like I want everything off it and then I
also did get pink one is where I would
the same thing I got a small in the top
and the tops like gonna be too small
see that's the thing with me like
sometimes I get swimsuits and the top in
this moment is perfectly fine and then
sometimes it's too small and in this
case it's
well nevermind oh just return it I'll
get a medium it's no problem be I'm not
going to try on just because of that
they are these are the bottoms as well
and they've got like a little mesh key
little thing on the back which is nice
there's already soft I love that okay so
that is everything for this video I hope
you guys enjoyed it make sure to give it

I'm not too sure on the black trousers I
feel like I will grow to love them and
then also with the white dress I just
would prefer if it was like the same do
you like the same material all the way
around and with the other swimsuits I'm
going to send them back and I'm gonna
change them because I love them I just
need a medium in the top yeah anyway I
