feel big time I feel like a big timer at
this marriage hi everyone welcome back
to my youtube channel and hello - ooh
here my name is Haven so in today's
video I'm gonna do more like a try on
clothing type of thing I basically did a
shot one pretty little thing and I
thought why not just show you guys what
I got and I see Patricia bright does
these videos all the time I love
watching her so I'm going to do a
similar style video to shout out to
Patricia absolutely love her and yeah
I'm gonna do it that kind of I've videos
today which we saw when everything will
be linked in the description box so yeah
let's just get into the video
okay so it's gonna be a little bit
difficult because my lens just I don't
have a lot of space in my room to fit me
all in but I wanted to show you out the
top half and then like lower the camera
and show you the bottom half so sorry
about that that's really annoying my
style is like proper playing like I love
playing stuff I love just like Gray's
blacks nudes white I don't really wear
much color see some people you think oh
my gosh she's so boring but anyway the
first thing I got is this shape grey
ribbed longline midi skirt and I've got
this cropped match this is a shape gray
ribbed the bun dough crop top I've got
the crop top in a size 10 and in a size
8 the reason I got a 10 in the top was
present in have an A and I really wanted
it so I don't think there's much
difference between an A and it's N
anyway okay I found away I'm going to
stand on my bed so we can see the
clothes because my camera just don't fit
the whole outfit in I've got the current
back as far as it'll go
yeah this is what the skirt and the top
looks like I love this I literally love
this yeah old obably definitely wear
this with like some trainers
probably like those prints or converse I
love them I think they look so good with
this and then talking like a big quiet
make it casual but you could also dress
this up and we're heroes of it okay
pretty little thing don't tell you how
much stuff is on the actual label which
is kind of annoying but I'm gonna link
below
it wasn't a lot I do I know that okay
next thing I picked up was this is a
stone root knit dress and I've got a
size 6
bitch why I think it's big
this is what I do yeah then I have my
size which is that a I always just get
like if there's a 10 I'll get a 10 if
not I'll just be like right let me just
try and get a 6 and see laughter so this
is what it looks like it's off the
shoulder I really like off the shoulder
dress is comes just above the knee but I
like this bit down the middle just like
I bet that you pause boys I think a six
will be okay because it's like look how
stretchy it is okay I don't have a fit
about this I think is quite sure like I
laugh off the shoulder dress is one of
my favorite styles to wear so I love
that it's like off the shoulder and it
feels nice but if it's a bit too short
for me to be honest it feels quite sure
I'm gonna show you
I definitely wear this out it's really
comfy it's really warm pretty wet sprite
drinks or something
but I do like this but I just I would
rather if it is like a bit longer cuz I
feel like at the back I'm just gonna
come off
do you know what I mean I'm only five
foot four so if you're taller than me
it's gonna be way short or and you do
like it like I do like this part of the
sleeve and I do like cuts off the
shoulder and I like this knit but down
the middle as well yeah maybe just a
little bit too short but I do like it
okay so next thing I got was this white
high neck ribbed bodycon dress
I'm hoping this is not going to be seen
through I hate it when you get white
stuff and it's C free cuz I love wearing
white makes minute way more time it
looks nice one black hair like I love
round white but I just it's so hard to
find white things that aren't seen but I
think this dress is only five pounds I'm
pretty sure so I did get this in the
size a okay listen this is probably
gonna be safer and it looks oh sure okay
this is so see-through I'm Han went it's
because you can see when it goes through
here this is so see-through and so
 tight like this is a size eight
and I feel like I can't breathe it's so
tight I
so got makeup on it shocked I just got
money trying to put over my hex it's so
 tight it's really short as well
trillion so this is a weird looks like
full-length yeah like this has sure its
moist
I tie it like I'm kind of a deal
but I do love this this type of like car
do you love this sort of style this is
like my thing so you can always get some
nipple covers and it'll be fine and I
feel like it definitely shows like
everything and it's this isn't a I'm
always a name and it's just this is
hella rude okay so I just put my hair
and put my nipple so you can't see them
but next I got this straight stone
slinky under bust crop top and a size 10
and it's shaped stone slinky leggings in
the size 10 as well I obviously got a 10
because there wasn't and I like I said I
knew that shows up I'm gonna free I
don't think really come free of clothes
I know I went to miss garden I was like
this issue nothing on you I want well
okay so these are the ligands they're
tight at the bottom they feel nice they
feel very thick and they're very
stretchy I like stretchy leggings I
don't want to be like uncomf you know I
mean oh and then this is what the top
looks like it's hot it's nice again
stretchy does they think it's going to
be seen for it it's quite good
I'm gonna get out of this white tight as
 dress okay so this is what this
looks like this is so comfortable and it
feels so nice
but these leggings have a bit of room
which I like I know many wear this sort
of thing when I'm going to just quickly
go out for food or whatever so I like a
bit of room so I can even put the
 one and we blow into this upset
fun and also this top feels nice the
only thing I would say about these is
they're a little bit too long like they
gathered at the bottom because they're
too long so yeah if you're taller than
me by fall these be perfect it just more
than me then just be aware of probably
gonna be a bit long she's also my humble
color this like blush nudey pink color
so mean I love it I told you I only wear
nude white growing black it's pretty
much what I wear but um yeah love this
okay so next I picked up some joggers
because I laughed over and then picked
up this pink wide sleeve metallic
cropped jumper which I thought is so
nice on the website like I literally
love this this is unreal so I'm gonna
pair it with some dollars something it
might look quite cute
so for these great joggers they're just
great that I the bottom normally I like
the ones that are like skin-tight and a
bit more thicker band at the bottom but
I did quite like this I mean it's good
on the girl on the model she kind of
wore a little bit off my leg which I
liked so yeah so I got these in a size
small
and this in a size doesn't say I think
this was a one size so this is the crop
job which I love I love these big
sleeves and I just love how it's like
that Miss Hannah key but pinky silver
looks so nice underneath I've got that
top on I just had a minute ago but I
just pulled the sleeve sound like that I
do have a top like this in my wardrobe
but it's just a commando type one but I
come home to get it so yeah but that's
what I would wear underneath this
because you can just wear this eye on
its own it's like Hello see for each I
mean I don't think I would work with
these jokers I have just paired with
these for now but I feel like these are
maybe too casual for this top I probably
wear like some my back table is a pretty
skin tight fit or I have some great jobs
they're different to this which I would
probably wear but these ones are just a
little bit too cash for this top I think
so this is what the job is that like I
love joggers I live in them I love them
yeah almost so they've got pockets on
the side they're really common kind of
just pump this bit off a little bit I
mean you could wear it all the way down
but I think an expert if you put it up a
little bit see I probably wouldn't wear
these joggers with this top I don't
think it looks worse but I think this
top is a little bit dressier than I
thought it would be I think it would
look nicer with jeans so if you see
somebody like like and you've got this
top and you can use flight shot me you
just slap them with your jump
off sick mates it pays the next I've got
this shape gray room toilet
so I'm gonna wear the bodysuit with the
jokerz and see what life's like I did
get this body suit and a size 10 I love
body suits body suits and joggers is
like my thing if you've been following
me for a while you know all I
why is dopplers and what he says I just
think he looks ok and it's comfy I'm not
being comfortable you know it's one of
those ones I has this bit at the bomb I
love that we love a popper at the bottom
we love a popup on the vagina yes okay
so I love this buddy soon I love it with
the dog as well I think it makes it look
a little bit like a jumpsuit it's cute
yeah I like the fit here I would say
here suck a little bit baggy I've done
if you can see like that is not very
tight I wish it was kind of like more
like that you know but it's fine so yeah
apart from the fact it's a little bit
buggy here I really love it I think it
looks really cute with these dogs so
this is what it looks like with the
joggers I think it was like a cute Oh
dump suit is so comfy as well again
comfort is key we don't do a brown
comfortable this is comfortable I'm
living thinking it's good if you pull
these up a little bit as well but I love
this I think it looks so cute so I did
get this big old coat which is a black
longline faux fur coat in a size 6
there is no my sticks with us some of
these coats come up massive they make it
up pee disease I'm worried you're like a
bit more but if they they really even
put any things on here you know so you
can't wear it and send it back oh I used
to no shame that one has not laid back
when you have no money I used to buy
office wear it send it back yeah so I
would wear this kind of coat with what I
have on now
so just casual called you not I mean to
just Chuck this on with this put some
black shades on top someone hands put
some black shades are not this yeah
sorry but who won who am i this is an
airport outfit for me this is an airport
outfit airplane swag you know how we do
know honestly I would wear this in the
airport but our base in the epilogue and
trainers this car is so warm and I like
it with the joggers and the bodysuit I
think it looks cool
this is really nice it's not too big
well like I said a lot of pizzas eat
this is just a little bit big do not I
mean cuz yeah awesome I got one in a
size 10 I thought it was crazy I looked
like it was just the code we just wanna
move me up it looks funny so yeah this
is what the code looks like the default
outfit see how it comes with the way
down you can all see blogs
okay Harry Potter or some
you know I did just get two hoodies
because I love throwing these on when
I'm we're going to run out the door
but with this hub outfit just for a MIDI
stay by Harry Potter paper and I will
show you what is it like this is yeah
why that's wrong I've got a white one
and flat one and I've got the size large
I like all your besides their countries
I can't like them to be big we should
have got white like why the did I
get why I'm so messy okay so this outfit
just went from casual to really
casual this is like comfort this is the
confÃ­a she'll ever be
this is so comfy but yeah I just love
again just throwing these on on top of
this to go get my nails done or going
down those Oh so something like that do
not mean but we don't wanna get dressed
up moose would be cash so yeah this is
what the full outfit looks like and that
coat comes up big I'm percent I don't
like it when it's if I don't like center
small probably would have been way more
up here and really tight I don't like it
I like it might be so about the exact
same one went black cuz I already have a
black one and I live in it and I'm just
so I need enough fun they did have a
Riina's kaki one on there but it didn't
have a large and I need a large you know
I mean I don't like I said I don't like
um small because like sometimes I like
to wear off the shoulder like that as
well this is that same as the white one
but just in black okay so that is
