see more of these videos just let me
know anyway so let's just get into the
video okay so I've got nipple covers on
this time because you know I have a last
time it was c4 you see when it was it
was annoying
so I happen imple covers on thus why it
might look a bit weird and I won't touch
him with hits but anyway also this top
is from pretty little thing because she
were wondering and the leggings are from
fashion over anyway about Faraday I put
so I got like look how much stuff I
have I have so much style I'm so excited
ah hi I like how they package this as
well like when you get your delivery at
like how it's always in a nice box okay
so our first move
bodysuit I love seeing people wear these
with jeans like high-waisted unions and
these days I think it looks so nice I
think Khloe Kardashian maybe started
this trend these lazy body suits with
jeans but I've seen them so many wearing
and I love it I really wanted to do it
myself
yeah I've got this body suit from them
which is so nice more tests I don't my
boobs are gonna fit in this to see
anything I'm going to give it a go
anyway but yeah this is the first item
which also you this is my sexy you can
write for your month as well I mean just
with nothing else cuz look at the back
of it it's like a thong as well and it's
got open back so yeah you can always
those for your man or you can compare it
jeans like compassion I'm gonna pair it
with some jeans now I'll show you what
it looks like I'm not gonna do that
thing when I take these tags off again
just in case this isn't fit and I can
exchange it so yeah I'm gonna take types
of this time I learned my lesson last
time everyone was like oh my probably my
pretty little thing who like oh my god
you just hit the times of what we don't
like it so yeah I'm not gonna take them
off in case I don't fit truth this whole
hour with you so come how I got a she
was read you that why I'm getting change
the page you see my ass wow oh wow I'm
about your foot for your end of your
jeans make kind of a hole okay so we
should have got a medium in this body
suit because the boob it is a bit too
small I'm not my boob hangs out the side
a little bit it's not the worst he's not
like really small but you should have
gone up work a size probably maybe yes I
should have also I just ripped my jeans
I'm gonna show you here we are again on
the beds somebody said you didn't like
it last time but you okay I can't
help it it's the only space a book so
we're gonna have to get on the bed
you have to do a minute this Jean I'm
gonna go was that she like that so
that's that these needs a pretty little
thing but I really like this outfit I
think it's pretty suit with these
rookies it's really nice I put me I'm
gonna try and go for a medium in this
because yeah my boobs like really fit in
this top bit very well could do ever
being a little bit bigger don't what the
thing is with these jeans this is why I
don't really like these jeans being
honest it's because at the back with
hair I have knows a groom I have loads
of space here but then there
really tight my thighs here we have like
a latex two-piece yeah I don't know why
I just didn't - oh it's gonna be late
exile for you to sit really properly but
it smells like rubber but yeah this is
it's a pencil skirt and then it's the
top as well so the top is in a size
small I think everything is in this room
get everything's in a small and
sometimes I have to get extra spoon with
some things on there and something small
like it just go on the motor I've gotten
the measurements thing and just check
the measurements but yeah anyway let's
try this on okay so the two-piece this
two-piece is 169 pounds so let's see
what it looks like on the bodysuit by
the way it was 59 pounds but stellar its
young pants what do you see i weirdly
like this okay
I actually really like theirs now I'll
put it on but the only thing is I feel
like people are gonna walk past me but
she's my shot robber do you not I mean
like I've really smells like rubber but
I do actually really like it
anyone went on for the venture will look
so but i weirdly actually liked it when
I felt it I was like I don't know but it
does smell it rubber it's anything so
yeah this is what it looks like it's a
really light lemon color I've really
liked the color over there I really like
the fit I really like the fit I just
don't know about the latex feel I wish
it was like a different material because
it just yeah
it smells like rubber it's to suck a
little bit I don't know how to explain
it I'm just gonna leave this out from
the back it's a little bit low it's just
a little bit like that at the back like
a little bit baggy which is annoying
that always happens to me on things like
the waist but the back is always big but
then this fits fine
I like sure you feel like in this if you
would like to sweat it would just get
stuck to you and like you won't be able
to get it off but yeah I do I do like it
I do I do actually I can't I just wish
it was a different material so next I
got this dress which isn't normally my
type of thing I don't really like too
much going on is in like the detail I
kind of like more just plain stuff like
like just like there's pain but I do see
this on the model of the website of why
it's so gorge and it's really summery I
like it so I got synthesize small this
is 119 pounds and it's like clear lace
at the bottom and then this bits got
like blowing in okay like a champagne e
gold type of line and it looks really
nice but yeah I thought this would be
really really nice as like if I went
racing this year race course or as a no
I just like Elega scheme anyway let's
try this one on get me out of this lady
xmas feel like I can't breathe okay I
actually really like theirs I didn't
expect to like this that much because
it's not normally my top of thing I
don't normally like this much detail on
a dress and we like it quite plain but I
actually do like this I just probably
wish that the boob it was maybe a bit
bigger so that I wasn't so boobie but I
do like it so yeah this is what it looks
like
I like the detail at the bottom where
it's like it doesn't have the line in I
really like that and I like the fear I
think it fits pretty well yeah I do
actually really liked it I didn't expect
to like it as much as this I kind it is
one of those ones very kind of bought it
and was like I might like it I might no
I'm just gonna say if I ever send it
back yeah I've read this one Bhupathi if
I go racing this year like ladies day or
something like that I think this would
be really nice for so I'll probably work
for something like that or I think this
is what this is really really nice but I
could wade in if you're going to any
weddings or Kristen's only fan out I
think this is really nice for that sort
of thing as well but yeah I do me like
this I like the bit I like it okay so
next I picked up these trousers they're
flared trousers they feel so heavy oh my
god like the weight of these is a joke
these feels so heavy but yeah these are
like just flares
I wasted trousers it is and I've got a
size small these are 89 pounds but like
oh my god I look like a silk line in in
the middle which is really nice okay so
I'm gonna try these on with that white
bodysuit the first thing that's right on
because I don't want to pair this way I
don't have anything okay so before
anyone jumps on my dick not literally I
don't know
and I this body suit I've got pants on
underneath and I haven't took the
plastic bit off because I'm gonna get a
medium some look about you try to own a
quota cousin's name and I didn't take
the little plastic wheel so don't
yourself okay anyway so these trousers
are really nice maybe a little bit I'm
definitely too short for these these are
like just on the floor like bad I'm
gonna show you in a minute okay this
whole time I just realized my camera
wasn't fully zoomed out so this is what
they look like on they are way too long
for me as you guys can see they're like
I'm literally standing on them they're
so long I'm going at my mom's tending
box and do like them so I would just see
I guess I'm not sure you get that I do
like that they have pockets and also
inside the pockets it's like still going
in and they do fit really well yes I
think it si small and you had a doofy
they look very nice
I am as I'm 5 foot 4 so if you're taller
than me these are going to be absolutely
fine swish your pills on and if you're
smaller than me just be aware these are
really long and even if I bet there was
one with these after that there's still
gonna be too long I am so
annoyed that the whole time so yeah
overall I do like these chances but I
just I wouldn't wear them with this
bodysuit I just don't like really love
it I probably work I write I'll probably
keep it all red or red and black I'm
probably not this white but yeah do you
like the trousers they're just too long
just sitting for me I got home send them
up so I next picked up this tube dress
like a bun dough cheap dress it's quite
long and this is like a day dress for me
I would waste with some flat sandals on
holiday or if I'm here just like sitting
talking all over and this in size small
this was 69 pounds so I'm gonna try it
on but yeah this is my type of thing I
like tube dresses okay so this is the
tube dress I'll jump on the bed and show
you what the rest of it looks like but I
love this this is so good for light in
the daytime like I said if I if it's
summertime and I want to go now shop
whatever just on put some sandals
you could dress up a hos event I think
everybody else's what's yeah this is
what it looks like full length I love it
honestly I love it I think it's so nice
it's so confident as well so yeah this
one is a love I love this one
it's kind of like a day or night listen
I guess the 15 euros in the Ukraine I'm
like okay where's to something close
that let's go
I'm not pressing the UK it seems a bit
of Sun I have got full summer outfit on
no given okay this next one I'm so
excited for I saw this on the website
it's so mean so it goes around the neck
like that
and it's a long and it's got this little
bit on the side here this detail on the
side to really love and it's so thick
and if there's so heavy if you've ever
had clothes from house of CV they are
100% worth the money like the material
is so good
it's such good quality so this is in a
size small again and this is 139 pounds
but yeah I'm so excited eyes on this
just yeah I love it I love it before
you've enjoyed it on it's pretty
monotone ones where I love it and I try
it on I don't like it I love this I know
I love this this is my final thing I
like the high neck I like the fit I just
this is just everything I love this it's
gonna be perfect for when we go for
dinner in Dubai I'm just going to take
these things off because they're so
annoying anyway I am obsessed I love it
so much I love this bit here on the side
I love wearing white because I think
white with my black hair is such a
contrast in it's so nice and I love it
with like a tan as well
this is what the back looks like it's
quite low but didn't feel like I would
need to wear nipple covers oh and I've
got the one now I don't feel like I
would need to say for likely you guys
will need to because it's such a thick
material I don't
it doesn't look see-through at all to me
yeah I would just pay the old post of
some strappy heels and it's going to be
perfect for dinner in Dubai your problem
with this one is that makeup brand here
how no there's nothing worse than
seeing a white dress with makeup there
and I love makeup so that's gonna be an
issue for me oh I thought I felt
really got a little bit on earth so I
got another white dress because I love
whites I just love it
although white is dangerous especially
if we're going out for drinks because I
wore white jumpsuit once and I was
walking with my wine like this was it
racing and some go there doesn't like me
from my old school and pushed me so that
the wine would go over me and I had like
a stay in here and I was like in the
toilets trying to pop it off it would
not come off so I ended up because of
what he didn't want to miss the race in
so I was like walking around like this
try to cover it up I was just like
it it it's never minds so I got
this strapless dress I love strapless
dresses I love them they're one of my
favorites and I also like my neck like
this as well since I snore this is 119
pounds this is the Rinat white dress
and it's got this detail at the back
where it's got a little bit of like a
slit at the back which is really nice
please pay for out the way so annoying
oh my god I love this I love this so
much I'm going to Manchester this
weekend because it's Todd's birthday so
I booked a hotel for him and we go out
for dinner and stuff so I think I'm
gonna wear this I love it
I'm obsessed this is my fave I think
it's a good length it's only just above
the name I don't like it when it they're
off and I when I like this and they're
really short I like a bit of length I
don't we start the detail at the back
I'll show you this is what this looks
like but yeah I'm obsessed with this one
I I love furnace one to the
other one I don't know what it is this
one I just I love this one I love that
one as well but I love I love this one
and yeah I like the back it's got that
little pleated detail at the back and it
fits perfect as well if it's so good
this is a small and this fits me perfect
it's also not see through it's got line
in underneath so it's got this and it's
what like a silky line and underneath
it's a thick material it's not seen
through at all I don't even need to wear
these nipple covers it's not seen for a
while so a bar
yeah that's it you're wearing this on
Friday definitely definitely
so next I picked up this jumpsuit and
this jumpsuit is in the size of small
this 139 pounds again it's so thick and
it feels really heavy you just know this
stuff is just such good quality I know
it's expensive but it's such good
quality I have had so much stuff from
this brand and I've never been
disappointed in the quality and it's
also got some sort of almost like a bone
in in it I suppose that kind of keeps it
up which is nice anyway let's try on you
try it on I don't want it off I love it
once it's dress off I don't want to go
cuz I'm gonna take it off that's not
ready take it off Oh
literally I love this one as well I love
this one I love this fit if it's so good
it feels so it's got a finger bone in
actually textiles at school don't you
remember what it's called but it's like
a mist if material that goes through
here and it keeps this up just correct
me if I'm wrong I think that's what it's
called but yeah this fits so well this
is a size small I am an 8 to 10 so what
geez mister size her friends I'm gonna
turn and this is a small anything it's
good ok so this is what this jumpsuit
looks like this fits so good this is
such a good fit it's tight at the ankle
which I like and if it's perfect here
this bit fits really good it's I feel
like it's really strong it's going to
stay I yeah I am obsessed with this one
as well I love this one ok so I next
picked up this Barbie bodysuit Barbie
pink bodysuit I love it I'm obsessed
this color is gorge again I'll wear this
with high-waisted jeans I love
it and this is again in a size small and
this was 59 pounds and it just felt that
you are really good quality it's got
that burn in anyway yeah I love this
color I'm obsessed I think is so
gorgeous it's so summery
see I'm definitely gonna pair this with
some jeans and the bottoms like this
silky material
she's very nice so I'm gonna try this on
real quick okay I absolutely love this
this with some jeans it to 6vq
I pretty much it with some maybe some
lighter genius but I just coming behind
any at the minute so these energies have
got by still thinkin xvq for some reason
the boob fit on this but it's absolutely
fine it fits perfect
I think it's because it goes to Fred
like it goes the structure and the way
it fits the slightly different to the
other one but as Smalling this one fits
me Pathak's my boobs for reference it's
hard because I've had a boob job so boob
job size is different to like normal
boob size but boob job size I'm a dirty
double D but I know what that would be a
normal web size certainly hard for
reference isn't it see this is what it
looks like as a fall outfit I would
pretty pair suppose maybe some cute
trainers like some all-white trainers or
maybe some strappy heels if I was just
going out for some drinks cuz I think
it's really cute I think he dressed it
up as well but I love this bodysuit
color I think it's so not at the time
it's so summery and it's just cute
I love it these jeans by the way if
you're wondering if I'm river island
they fit so good the only thing I'm
gonna do so far is I'm gonna exchange
the white bodysuit and maybe get a
medium instead but apart from that
everything else wanna keep I love it so
this is really dressy stuff I got so
jump suits dresses trousers and body
suits that's what a dressy stuff and
then I also got so mature and wear
because I sin that they started in a gym
whenever you want to try it and I think
it's neon orange is really cute and also
I want is some like cycling type of
shorts for the gym because sometimes
like it's so hot so I a in like
full of leggings or even freeport of
them I just think these cycling shorts
would be so much better and especially
as big and in summer and stuff I think
this is perfect so anyway I also like
the neon orange okay so I've got these
cycle shorts and is smaller these are 34
pounds and I was orange sports bra to
match again in a size small and this was
29 pounds but I had to get the matching
talk because I'm random people I have to
match
things it's so annoying like I wonder
people going by underwear like I can't
just buy the bra or contents by the
bottom I have to get much in I'm just
yeah I don't if anybody else saw that
okay so this is what the gym stuff looks
like it fits so well this is so
supportive it's a little bit tight but
it's I prefer it to be tight because
when I'm running and stuff
my boobs do move believe or not I know
everyone thinks fake boobs don't move
but they do and it does hurt so
this is nice and supportive which I like
and these fit really well as well these
aren't really good I've got the color
shows up but I want to stand up here see
how this is what it looks like so if
you're looking for some gym stuff and
you're like me you don't care about
being over the top then this is
perfect for you I think it's really nice
and then I think the fits really good it
looks nice with the tan and it's cute
also I feel like when you buy a new gym
wear it makes you want to go to the gym
more because you've got the cute young
man you know then you know I mean so
next thing which is gym wear this is
just your chalk on over the top of this
it's a crop today and it's why we should
accept this this is again in a size
small and this is 39 pounds I'm scared
to put songs I've got makeup on then
it's white okay so this is what this
looks like
and it's got this thing here that you
can pull I love you sort of things so
you can make it tight like that or
however you want to wear it I've got
this thing right round me neck pretty
gonna treat yourself this is the crop
today which I think it looks cute move
the gym stuff because I like to wear a
jumper in the gym because I like to
sweat more so I want you to put jumper
on top then if you do get too hot you
can take it off and you've got any nice
orange matching gym wear on and it looks
cute if I'm ready to go cycling John I
mean cycling shorts go cycling get that
way so I did get some shoes I do want to
try the shoes on because I don't want to
stand on my bed with the shoes on you
know I mean like a stiletto heel on my
nice bed shoes no thanks for oh I'm
going to show you what they look like
anyway sorry just got some
these are just black like normal
stiletto heels and then this is like a
bit clear okay
I just wanna like a gray color okay
I don't even explain it have you
explained that comment below you can see
what it is anyway but these are the
shoes that I got I like it when it has
this like clear sort of strap but it's
not all black it goes with more things
and yeah I don't want to try them on
because the only way you'd see the
thought is if I saw them like that and I
didn't want to stand on my leg with
stiletto heels you know I mean yeah
these are them that is everything that I
got so I got dressy stuff I got some gym
stuff and just like stuff for my holiday
