channel and hello hi if you're new here
my name is hi boo nice to meet you
so today I've teamed up with iconic
London to bring you this video and I'm
going to be showing you all about their
bloggers choice brush set
so in this brush set you get 7 face
brushes and 5 eye brushes so I'm gonna
be demonstrating how I use these brushes
in this video and how to get this makeup
look these brushes are a hundred percent
cruelty free they are so soft they are
like ridiculously soft I have washed
these brushes a few times and they've
kept the shape perfect also they don't
mop which I love even when I wash these
like I don't get any bristles fall out
and when I apply any product the
bristles don't fall out
I hate those brushes where you use them
and then the brush the bristles just get
stuck to your face and your flow pick it
off and then like when you wash them the
bristles pull it out don't worry I've
wash these a few times and the bristles
do not fall out they are a very good
quality and see ya you get 5 eye brushes
7 face brushes I'm going to show you
exactly how I did this makeup look using
these brushes just before we get into
the video there's a discount code which
is Holley 20 it's only for the brush set
and you get 20% off it's for 7 days only
and if you just want to get anything
else off the website I do have a normal
code which is Holley 15 I've had that
code for so long now I just always
forget to tell you I'm sorry but yeah I
have Hollie 15 as well which gets you
discount off anything else on the
website so if you want to get the
brushes used khojali 20 that's 20% off
for 7 days only and then anything else
on the website is holly 15 and but I'll
put it all in the description box anyway
it's just a little bit confusing but
yeah if you want to see how I did this
makeup look using these brushes then
keep watching also coming out with my
hair like what what is this doing
so the first brush I'm going to use is
this fluffy brush it comes in the set I
love this for the in the crease the
transition color I like a big fluffy
brush this when it's really soft I'm
gonna do quite a simple up today you
only need two eyeshadows and this is
like my go-to look it's very glam but
it's really really easy as well like I
wear it all the time also if you have
brown eyes this is like the best look
for brown eyes I think so I'm going to
take my bronzer this is my mac
mineralize skinfinish and winning use
this as my transition color so I'm going
to pick up some of the color on this
brush and just
if I this straight in the crease and
woody circle emotions see how these
brushes are really really soft they hold
up really well I mean I push these brush
up so many times and the bristles are
still perfect they haven't gone out of
shape they have a molt it or anything
which is really good yeah this is like
my favorite look to do it's something
that I do all the time when I want to do
it quick I look by when it's a really
glam so from my Jaclyn hill palette I'm
gonna take this color right here so I'm
going to take this brush from the set
which is perfect for packing color all
over the eyelid which is what I love to
use it for and it's quite a short dense
brush which I like and so yeah I'm gonna
pick up some of that shade on this brush
and I'm gonna just press this all over
the lid so yeah I'm just back in this
color on this this brush is really good
packing color on the lid but this fluffy
brush that I used for the bronzer color
I'm just gonna go back and forth over
that line and we're gonna blend it in
one thing I love about iconic London is
that they really value my opinion when
it comes down to things like they always
ask my opinion on staff and they always
send me products before Chand just ask
like my opinion and they are genuinely
interested and I think that's so nice
from a brown because you know me I
always keep it 100 I always tell them
what I think and stuff okay so after
that I'm gonna take this really thin
eyeliner brush from I could have gone
down and I'm gonna use my signature
liner and I'm gonna line my lash line
and I'm gonna put this in my waterline
as well this brush is really thin and it
does apply the product really nice gonna
line my lash line this brush is really
good for your lash line eyeliner because
it's really thin it's easy to control
the product as well okay then I'm going
to put this in my top waterline as well
which I always do always put liner went
up waterline
I don't want to smudge that out make a
little bit more smoky so I'm going to
take this pencil brush from iconic
London and I'm going to pull that and
I'm just gonna go back and forth over
the liner just to smudge it out I like
that this
this pencil brush again I'm just gonna
smudge that liner let's make it more
smoky and I'm just pressing some of that
dark brown over that liner at the end
there just to kind of bend that in a
little bit more okay so I just put some
lashes on so I'm gonna start on my face
I'm gonna use my glam blow
what burst glow moisturizer and I'm
going to use this angled kabuki brush
from the set I like to use the flat one
for my foundation and I like to use this
one for my primer so I'm gonna use this
glam glow water-based moisturizer first
of all and I'm just gonna buff this into
the skin sometimes I like to use
moisturizers in private of my hands
sometimes with a brush just depends but
this brush is really good for applying
moisturizer and primer I'm gonna use my
flat kabuki for foundation so I'm gonna
put some of this vanish on the back of
my hand I use the shade cashew which is
3w 2 and yes I'm gonna pick some this up
on the brush and I'm gonna buff it into
the skin I have found with this
foundation that it works better with a
brush I do with a brush the other day
and it definitely applies better with a
brush I think the thing is I just get so
easy to use in a beauty blender I always
think the view burned off must be the
best thing so I'm gonna do my concealer
I'm gonna use my duo forever skin under
cover concealer I'm gonna fit under my
eyes and I went to using this one be
kissing my makeup a variation one
because this one's darker and I don't
want it as bright on dry today
so you know I am gonna use my
sponge permission of color correctors
oops I forgot dark circles sometimes
still shade three more so when my
concealer is light I think it's more
obvious so I have got this Barry M all
night long full coverage concealer I
don't have the right shade for my under
eye but I do have this dark shade
somebody's this is like a cream bronzer
I'm gonna see
one of those light this is in the shade
6 which is hazelnut see I'm going to
just stop this around my forehead I'm
going to see how this works
I know it's a concealer but I want to
try it like this and see what it looks
like and then I'm going to go back to
this foundation brush from iconic London
and I'm going to buff this in what I
like to do when it comes down to like a
cream runs over but I like to use what I
use for my foundation to buff it in
because you have a little bit of the
foundation on the brush so I feel like
it really helps to blend it in really
well see I like to use whatever I used
my foundation from my cream bronzer as
well because you get a better blend see
I'm just passing him and his brush I'm
kind of gonna buff it upwards a little
bit as well cuz I don't want to bring it
down too far and I'm not contouring but
I still don't want to bring it too far
down my cheek so when I step around her
I'm going to use my Mac Patrick Starr
powder he's gonna personalize it so much
in so I do love both of these brushes
for bronzer but today I'm going to use
this fluffy brush but this big fan brush
for bronze is really really good as well
and we have maurices round fluffy brush
today which is again so soft like it
feels so nice I'm going to use my Mac
mineralize skinfinish in the shade
update and I'm gonna just apply this on
top of where we applied that concealer
under this brush is really gonna evenly
dispersed in the product as well which
is nice it's really nice and fluffy I
flow so bronze right now I love it
so next I'm gonna use this a fluffy
angled brush I like to use this one for
blush so I'm gonna take my uh Nastasia
blush kits in the raid this is the
radiant care and we take this color
right here and when I apply it to the
apples but always we're going to bring
it back a little bit as well I like to
bring my blush all the way back
sit on the alcohols are there like that
let's finish off the under eyes I'm
going to go back to this fluffy brush
from the ice app I'm gonna take that
bronzer color and I'm gonna apply this
underneath the eye and I'm gonna take
this all over the lid brush that I used
and that color from the Jackson Hill
palette that brown color and I'm going
to apply that under the eye and I'm
gonna go back to the fluffy brush to
blend it together then I'm gonna go to
this little brush like this and when I
liner I'm gonna put some in my bottom
waterline I'm going to bring it down
slightly so we can smoke it out see I'm
gonna play in the waterline and then it
bring it down a little bit as well and
then ways take this pencil brush and I'm
gonna smudge it again then I'm gonna
just apply some bottom mascara so I'm
going to use my iconic London
illuminator drops I'm gonna use this
shade original because I like to apply
them with this fluffy brush which that
was way annoying but I really like to
fight with this so I'm gonna just put
some drops in the back of my hand like
that and then I'm gonna dip my brush in
it come on
I'm just gonna kind of get rid of some
excess on the back of my hand and then
I'm gonna apply it yeah my cheekbones I
like to press it on with this brush
rather than a sponge because sometimes I
felt this sponge I end up putting it up
too high or bring out down to live
versions this brush it's really easy to
place it exactly where you want it I
also think if you press it on with this
brush it's better than a sponge because
it doesn't take off your product
underneath so I'm also fine with a
sponge if you go to apply these drops
and it kind of like messes up the
foundation underneath so I don't think
you prefer with the brush I've only
recently started using this brush for
liquid highlight not number two every
two weeks so just using my by okay
the lip pencil and then I'm gonna show
my lips and a little bit of this then
I'm going to take peach stock by Mac
then I'm gonna use my NYX butter gloss
in the shade mother lion on top so with
the fan brush you can use this bronzer
and you can also use it for highlight
love that and this one which I'm going
to show you now if you contour I'm going
to do anyway and if you can pick up some
powder on this brush and just press this
in underneath your contour like that and
then it really needs up your contour so
yeah that's what that brush is for which
is a flat brush you can use it to neaten
up your contour like that
leave it to fake for a few minutes and
then dust it off so I'm gonna dust it
off with this firm brush and there you
go it reads sharpens that up gives you a
sharp contour so that is the finished
look and that is how I use the brushes
don't forget there is a discount which
is Holly 20 it's only valid for 7 days
and you get 20% off the brush set it's
called the blogger choice brush set I
will link it down below in the
description box it also comes with a
really nice bag I've which you to use in
