hi everyone so today I'm going to be
filming that look that I created the
other day I don't actually know what to
call this so I'm going to snapchat you
guys
or tweet and get you guys to name it for
me because I really don't know what's
name here and basis like the pink cut
fresh with the yellow and the winged
liner and that's when we film in so I'm
going to get started straight away I've
already done my eyebrows and primed my
eye so I'm using the Sigma brilliant and
spellbinding palette and you can use
code Holly and I think you get it I
think it's kind of funny and you get
money off I think it's Holly well I'm
not sure I'll put in the description box
anyway so I'm going to take my winged
liner brush by Sigma and I'm going to
take this pink shade right here I'm
going to cut the crease out using this
you don't want to go in the crease you
want to go at just above the crease or
wise it won't show up
so now I'm going to take my Sigma medium
sweep brush and let you take some of
that pink shade on this brush and I'm
just going to blend this line up close
I'm then going to add some of this
orange shade right here
after that I'm going to take my Mac soft
ochre Paint Pot and my map to go to
brush I'm going to carve out my eyelid
then I'm going to use the same app super
to brush and we're going to take this
yellow shade right here and verify that
all over the lid
then after that I'm going to take this
glitter from collections called glam
crystals dazzling gel liner and I'm just
going to apply that literally on the
crease
so when I take my in black gel liner in
77 and my wind garden brush fires at
Weaver and of course I'm going to wing
my liner
and to lashes I'm going to use here to
vewy lower lashes these ones are so dry
but I live them like Hummel says I'm
using the demure lashes um adhesive
because it's really good
see some people like amazing backdrops
I'm like damn I wish I have room for
that but I don't want to be about I will
get some crazy flip back books but one
day will help animals in the background
next day we have some glitter dip today
we'll have something us some animal
wallpaper two elephants maybe and some
glitter who knows there'll be a complete
surprise every single time video video
I'm sorry I saw a broken record but for
primer I'm going to use the Smashbox
primer what's up because I'm upstairs
like I just find it so hydrating and a
really love it so I'm not about to
change
okay and then frappe for festive ffff
hair ok so for fat for foundation I'm
going to use the NARS sheer glow
foundation and I've got shaders really
dog just because I'm going away and I'm
going to beat and I went to town really
dark tile needed to get dark foundation
so I feel like probably me putting
something I was going to be a little bit
too dark but I'm just going to give it a
go anyway I'm gonna take my Beauty
Blender and I'm gonna apply this with
this
I've decided I have set up this
furniture thing this is my new favorite
I love it
they focus dude I'm going to use the
NARS creamy concealer in custard
obviously I'm going to reason the laura
mercier translucent powder when do I not
use this who is excited for the Nikki
tutorials &amp;amp; 2face collaboration like I
just can't like way that I'm so excited
I could probably tell you like that
she's so fired
I need that I can just go away okay so
I'm going to take the back of Nissan um
just surprising with this quick
okay and then I'm gonna come to using my
Taylor blue contour kit which looks a
mess I'm going to take shade 6 which is
the darkest one so I'm going to take the
pink shade from this palette but used
for my crypt cut crease and this pencil
brush from iconic London I'm just going
to run that under my eyes and then I'm
going to take the first I used to apply
the yellow shade and take that yellow
shade again and apply it up on the inner
corner to meet the opposite over halfway
then I'm going to take my winged liner
brush by Sigma the smaller one that I
used to cut the crease and i'm going to
take my gel liner and apply some of this
in the waterline
okay so for highlighter first of all I'm
going to take the marker Jacobs glow
stick I'm just going to apply some of
this fast because I really want it to be
really intense so if you apply a cream
highlight for you apply powder it's
obviously going to be a lot lot more
intense so that's what I'm gonna do
I'm then going to take my Kiko eyeshadow
in 208 as a highlight you've got you you
look 9 what I love their site and it's
sorry too it's like 6 pounds and it is
just everything like it's just the say
bomb like obsess on over so you look
down
so how cool is that I think that on
snapchat waging have like a little
cartoon of yourself
I put mine a unicorn outfit I wasn't gay
u-kwon comes back through it ok ok so
for lips I'm going to take the this is
from ring-ring con cosmetics and this is
the this is Carla's range if I run it so
much what we do about Hanukkah it's from
below and descents from below these
liquid lipsticks are really really good
I love them I've been pairing them
without lip glosses and they've been
staying out all day so I love it but I
was going to apply this first and then
I'm going to apply gloss
add that on top I'm going to put the lip
cream by L'Oreal and this is the n2 10
called disco ball flies on top I said
that is a finished look I hope you guys
