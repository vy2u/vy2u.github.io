wanted to say my apologies and give you
an explanation some of you may know some
of you may not know there were some
tweets that I wrote in 2012 that were
horrific horrendous awful vile vile vile
things and I'm not going to sit here and
give you any excuses I'm not going to
say it was age it was anything like that
I'm not gonna give any excuses because
there's no excuse for it whatsoever I
was an internet troll
that was right and vile things on the
internet but would never dare ever say
it's somebody's face it's completely
embarrassing I'm honestly ashamed of
myself there's people that I've been
friends with for 10 12 years that are
completely shocked because they know me
and they've never known me to ever be
like that I was obviously an internet
troll just posting vile things online
for attention or I've done it but I
can't give you an excuse because there's
no excuses for it and I don't know I
don't know why I would say those things
I want you guys to know the thing you
see on here on YouTube is exactly who I
am I don't you know I don't switch the
camera off and then I'm some horrible
nasty person I am exactly who you see is
Who I am and I'm not sucking with some
management or some agency that's saying
you know you need to put out an apology
I wanted to do this because I felt so
much girl and so much anger towards
myself
and I needed to address the situation
and tell you guys exactly how it is and
I'm so so sorry this tweet was brought
to me a few months ago and when I first
saw her I thought it was edited if it
was photoshopped if it was fake
I've seen that happen to people before
and I was like this can't be real I
would never write like this I want the
funds and then I looked into it I got
some other people to look into it and
know about Photoshop and whatever and
they told me that nobody this is
something that you did right and I was
honestly embarrassed and just so so so
ashamed of myself so there was about
four people tweeting me about it on
Sunday and I thought they need to
address the situation myself I posted
the screenshot on Twitter with an
apology and I just felt like that
apology was not enough I need his
comment here to apologize as well I
posted that apology on my Twitter
account and I in the end when private on
Twitter because
I'm not trying to make this a pity party
I'm just telling you straight the reason
why I went private on Twitter after I
put the hole the screenshot and the
explanation I went private because I was
getting deference and just so much abuse
that I mentally wouldn't I didn't want
to look through I have not yet debated
my Twitter for the same reason it's not
good for me to keep reading it and I
completely understand why people hate me
and people write nasty things and I
don't blame them whatsoever it was
important for me to come on here and
address the situation because I never
want to upset anybody
you guys show me so much love and
support all the time and I'm so so
grateful for every single one of you and
I don't ever want to upset any of you
that's the last thing on earth I ever
want to do I just need you guys to know
that person that wrote this thing six
years ago is not me
that vile ignorant horrible
bitch that wrote those things is not me
I understand if people can't accept my
apology and don't wanna support me
anymore I completely understand still
want to say a massive thank you to you
for all the support and love you've
shown me over the two and a half years
I've had here on YouTube and I just want
to say a huge thank you to everyone
that's always allowed me to be myself
from you two it's given me so much
confidence and I just love and
appreciate you and I owe you the world
honestly I owe you the world and I just
want to say thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
