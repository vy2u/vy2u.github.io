hello if you're new here welcome hi my
name is Holly Boone so today's video I'm
gonna be doing Instagram chooses my
makeup I actually saw Laura Lee do this
video I'm not sure who did it first I
think Laura said that Jamie Paige did it
first so I'll link them both below
anyway and that's what I'm gonna be
doing today so yeah basically just asked
you guys on Instagram I just did like
little polls for each thing to see what
you guys would pick I try to do for
every single one like one high end and
one low end but I'm gonna start with my
brows and my eye makeup in case we get
any fallout and then I could just wipe
it away to my face I just prefer doing
my eyeshadow first and so for brows you
guys sixty one percent said NYX brow
pencil which is the one that I use all
the time I'm so glad you did because I
print it against Anastasi beverly hills
dipbrow pretty much the only other brow
product that I have at the moment so I'm
so cut you guys chose the NYX brow
pencil it's my fave see I always just
got up below the brow above the brow and
then just start to fill it in but I try
to get my eyebrows like really really
like the same is like Mission Impossible
literally and this next I'm just gonna
comb some brow joffrey though I'm just
Anastasia Beverly Hills brow gel I don't
have another brow gel for you guys to
choose okay so concealer it was between
Laura Mercier and maybe a razor eye and
68% if you said Maybelline eraser eye
and it's definitely my favorite
drugstore concealer I literally love it
so I'm gonna be using the shade nude I'm
going to apply this using my Mac 195
brush I'm gonna carve up my brows and
I'm just going to apply it all over the
lid as well
next do ever nice to say that was hot so
I'm gonna find a norm laughing okay
powder
it was between Laura Mercier and our CMA
and 55% of you have said our CMA because
using powder which I haven't used in
such a long time that's why I put it on
there so I was like I kind of want to
try it again
haven't eaten it
sometime and but I'm gonna use some of
this sex my lids the only put my farmer
this powder is that the container is
messy this brush is the morphe I don't
even know doesn't have a number on it so
knowing the reason I'm saying it with
powder I know sometimes I don't and this
is it concealer on eyeshadow base if I
said it would just slide around and I'm
just using concealer to get rid of any
discoloration so it's all kind of like a
blank canvas for the eyeshadow so next
was eyeshadow and it was between the
morphe 35p palette and the Juvia space
magic palette even though it wrote
Julia's place why correct coming up
yeah morphe 35o 59% so that's what I'm
gonna get a reason I put the morphe 35p
palette because i found it the other day
and I completely forgot that I even had
it and I used to use it all the time so
I think I'm gonna do knock up books
obviously this is full of purples and
browns so I think I'm gonna do a purple
smokey eye I think that's why I fancy
today so I'm gonna take this color first
of all this purple color here I'm gonna
use my Sigma e30 eight diffuse to crease
brush and I'm just gonna apply this just
above the crease see I'm going to add
this purple in the crease just above the
crease and then I'm gonna go all over
the lid with like maybe a really really
deep purple or like a black just fence
it's like really dark on the eyes today
I can't either discontinuing the 35b
palette that is like one of my faves the
bold palette of all the bold colors
the only problem of it is those
eyeshadows do stay in your eyes but I
just love that palette so party they're
discontinuing it I'd understand why
maybe they were we doing it were like
revamping it or someone's doing a collab
with them I don't know who's excited for
Jaclyn Hills new launch I literally
cannot wait I'm so psyched I love that
dark and help on it morphe palette so
the fact that she's bringing out all
those other shades I'm just a kind of
way that Jaclyn hill paint is probably
one of my absolute guys who's like I
just love it so the fact that she's
bringing out more I'm just unleash can I
wait
okay so I'm gonna do a full on smoky eye
so I'm going to take the black next from
this palette and this brush is the Sigma
large shader e60 brush I tried to bring
up too high because I'm obviously gonna
blend it out so I'm gonna go back in
with this brush and I'm gonna take a
clean fluffy brush this is one from the
Anastasia Beverly Hills palette these
brushes gonna go over that up just have
a clean brush nothing on it if you want
any like step-by-step tutorials and how
to do like a double cut crease or and if
I let me know cuz I did do a
step-by-step like really in-depth one
for like a halo eye and Lowe's you guys
are you like that so let me know if you
want more of them so next up was lush it
was between Lily lashes and doll lashes
and 54% said doll lashes cuz I just
wiped away the fuller under my eyes so
lashes obviously will use wxs but you
guys chose I'm gonna stuck to I think
I'm gonna go for the evil ash and then
I'm gonna stick the jasmine ones on as
well cuz I want them to worry too much
okay so I'm gonna leave those that's
just to dry for a bit before I stick
them on it just makes it so much easier
and it's not as messy so primer
it was between Wiseau or hours primer
and the NYX angel veil and 54 percent of
you said NYX angel veil so sort of many
years i love the wire so Al's prime eyes
you guys know it's putting my favorite
but this is my favorite drugstore primer
I do like this probably cares
it really smooths out the pores and it
kind of smooths the whole face and it's
not too silicone you know I mean next
was foundation and it was between the
Maybelline 24 hours stay and the Estee
Lauder Double Wear
and 65 percent if you said them maybe in
24 hours say which I'm glad because it's
definitely my favorite at the minute you
guys know I use it was on my fave and so
I'm gonna mix the shade caramel beige
with the shade born I'm just gonna dock
this around my face first I haven't done
a smokey eye in like forever I feel like
yeah who's what you love Island
would you would you guys think I heard
you like because of anyone that you
don't like
I'd love Alex to find someone because
you're just really sweet isn't it it's
just really nice
I hope Samira find someone but I feel
like the mirrors just been a little bit
fuzzy I don't know though because she
does like the blonde boy doesn't she
but she's good so hopefully yeah
hopefully Samira gets a couple up with
someone hopefully Alex does as well
tonight apparently they were happened if
Adam didn't know something the last
episode I am hooked oh no I'm not gonna
lie I bet he's done something like
kissed another girl or I don't know said
something about another girl anyway so
concealer you guys picked I don't see
the maybelline concealer so I'm gonna
use that for my under-eye as well okay
my father I swear my foundation just got
darker it like lit she just got laka
it's just oxidized on me this funny she
never oxidizes on me what's going on
show you what I think it's the primer
and the primer is making its it funny as
well okay it looks a bit patchy can you
guys see here don't you feel patchy I'd
have to take it off because I actually
want this to look nice he's oxidized I
call it really orange abuse that angel
bow before I used to use it for l'oréal
foundation so I don't know if like it
just doesn't work with this foundation
but yeah it just made my foundation
oxidize and sit funny on my skin and he
Stephanie the primer because I used this
foundation all the time as you guys know
it's like my holy grail sorry guys we
have to get back to my wire sell primer
it's just the only one that works for me
I just love it it's so worth my anxious
I'm sorry but yeah they're just my
foundation looks so weird like we're
just sitting funny sometimes it is the
primer oh not the foundation just salute
your way because I know a lot people
have tried this foundation this may be
24 hours day and said it's not work for
them maybe try a different primer
because I use this primer with this
foundation nearly every single day look
whenever I do eye makeup I always wear
it and it's always sits amazing and I'm
perfect okay that's so much better
so just piled
to lashes on avoid them really really
Jamaica that's why they look crazy but I
love them and I used the evil ashes and
then I stack the Aurora lashes on top
and I'm living for it so next thing I'm
gonna use my Maybelline concealer she
guys chose and I'm gonna replace with my
Mac brush like I just did before I wiped
it off yeah it has an oxidized now it's
foundation so that was really weird
definitely something to do with the
primer then I love a really bright under
eye when I've got really dark on the
eyes so next you guys obviously chose
the RC made translucent powder so I'm
gonna close to my under eye to set
though so they said I do like this
powder it's really inexpensive which we
were looking for one sec cheaper and you
get a lot of product for your money as
well and also you don't get flash back
or anything like that the only thing I
find a bit is it's like a bit messy it's
anything and I do find with my Laura
Mercier one is it makes it looks a
little bit smoother but this one's still
really good so if you're on a budget
then I definitely recommend this one I
think you can get it from Beauty Bay or
cold Beauty or one of them so I'm just
gonna finish up my under-eye
I'm gonna take my Sigma e30 8 diffused
crease brush it that purple and when I
place underneath the eye I'm gonna go
back to this clean fluffy brush yeah
under started Beverly Hills one okay so
next I can didn't want to add like a
blue in the bottom waterline just like a
metallic you blue pen so from Marc
Jacobs this wasn't in the Instagram pics
I make up by just wanna add it I think
yeah I like that so I think if I add
black it's gonna be a little bit too
much so this big spell it's like a
metallic blue these are probably one of
the best eye pencils ever they're so
creamy
they're like my favorite okay so next I
asked you guys which bronze are you
me to use and it was between the mac
mineralize skinfinish and the morphe
brunt or which is a contour slash
bronzer and 57% of you guys said to Mac
mineralize skinfinish which I thought
you wouldn't say just because I use it
all the time but yeah I'm glad you said
thanks is my favorite so we're gonna use
that I use the shade dark deep I
definitely think I need a lighter shade
this was a little bit too red I do think
I need to get giving me Sun again so I
remember I bought this one ages ago when
I was really tired from my holiday and
giving me some was just like a little
bit too light but now this was like way
too dark and I just forgot to replace it
a lighter one but yeah yeah I'm shocked
you guys chose this bronze artist
because he I use all the time so I
thought you'd be like use something
different I probably use Mac mineralize
skinfinish since David ice it's like two
years ago constant on my youtube channel
nearly every single video I guarantee
I'm probably used it okay so did ask you
guys to choose blush but I think for
this look because the eyes are so smoky
and I think just bronze eye bronze your
skin will look better I think if I apply
like a pinky blush it's gonna be too
much I just I think it's gonna good so
I'm gonna skip out the blush part so the
next thing you guys chose which was
highlight so I actually always choose
between dull Beauty highlight and the
amrezy a BH highlighter - my absolute
fave and 60 percent of you said w/e so
that's what I'm gonna use and this is
this shine bright highlight I love love
love this highlight I cannot even
explain so so nice I also have this from
WT as well which is the duo and it has
two shades in it which is cool as well
cuz I like the light one from my inner
corner I'm gonna use my morphe M 501
brush okay three like some days I just
don't like a bright highlight some days
I like like a recycle this up a little
bit and then sometimes I like a beaming
highlight and this is what I like a beam
in highlight this one's perfect
okay so next Phillips I asked you guys
to choose lipliner and it was between
Kat Von D
NIC's and 60% of you said Nick's I'm
going to use my NYX lip liner in the
shade London this is my absolute fave
and then for lip gloss I asked you guys
to between Primark and the NYX butter
gloss and 53% of you said NYX butter
gloss my line my lips first this line on
this is a NYX white lip liner in the
shade London and it is my ride or die
before you sleep of here and use this
and then I'm gonna fill my lips in with
this as well and then I'm gonna apply
the butter gloss on top which is in the
shade Madeline they changed the
packaging for this glass used to be
different
they've only changed to ages ago and I
ain't just no it's definitely had this
one for ages just gonna take that so
beauty highlight gon and let's hit the
light it's cut out I'm just gonna price
in the inner corner of my eye sit in a
corner her light and then I'm gonna do
some highlights on the bridge of my nose
and then lastly for sentence brushed you
guys glam glow or Moorthy and 59-cent if
you said glam glow and I'm glad because
I have actually tried this yet so I'm
excited to try it so this is the glam
glow makeup setting spray and yeah I
recently got this so I have actually
tried it yet okay so I'm just gonna
spray my face with this smells nice it
smells like that moisturizers I love
them wish to Rose's this one at Terry's
chocolate orange so that is the finished
look I hope you guys enjoyed this video
