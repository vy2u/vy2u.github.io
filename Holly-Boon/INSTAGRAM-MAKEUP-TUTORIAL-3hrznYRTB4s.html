yeah
hey everyone today I'm going to be
filming that Instagram makeup look I'll
post it on Instagram the other day loads
of you requested to see a video so
that's what I'm going to be doing and so
I've already done my eyebrows and I used
the Elizabeth Arden brow pencil I'm
going to do a video and show you guys
how I use this because this is what my
favorite brow product at the moment so I
will do a video using this and but I'm
just gonna prime my eye and carve out my
eyebrows using the Maybelline fit me
concealer
okay so to start with for my transition
color I'm going to be using a Peach
Smoothie by my cupcake which is this
shade right here and this shade is
perfect for transition shade for pretty
much all skin tones so and we've put
ilex that you do so highly recommend
getting Peach Smoothie if you don't
already have it these are now available
to get in the UK as well you can get
them on beautybay
so next I'm going to go in with frappe
by makeup geek which is this shade here
just going to apply that in my crease
I booked this table and you brush from
urban decay if you get the part you get
this brush just going to take this
fluffy end here which is clean and I'm
just going to blend those two shades
together so now taking my zoeva luxe
petit crease brush I'm going to take
shade cocoa bear which is a darker brown
shade so this shade right here I'm just
going to apply that to the outer corner
of my eye
so now I'm going to go in with is I'm
using the the warm spectrum palette by
Ziva I'm going to take this black shade
here and just apply that in the outer
corner of my eye again and I'm going to
use that same brush which is the zoeva
luxe booty crease brush
I'm just taking the upper end of this
brush by urban decay I'm going to take
this shade from there's a Weaver palette
just apply that on my brow bone I'm
taking my mac 242 brush I'm just going
to apply some of the Mac Paint Pot in
rubenesque
over my eyelid
and I'm going to be taking shade magic
act by makeup geek and apply this on top
so next for eyeliner I'm going to be
applying the Superliner ultra precision
liquid liner by L'Oreal okay so after
that I'm just going to replace the Mac
extended plane mascara to my lashes
whenever you do your winged liner are
just a trick for everyone because I
struggled to do a winged liner just as
much as anyone else
I always just end up messing it up here
but then I'll actually just take a
makeup wipe like this on my finger
and just literally wipe it so it's
really neat um so that's just a little
trick for you and messing up the windows
I know don't worry you can do that so
for lashes I'm going to use the iconic
lashes by house of lashes I've been
obsessed with these lately and I just
love them even if you're from the UK and
you want to get some and I got one off
of ebay so there's loads on there so if
you want to get some them eBay is where
is that okay so I'm using the F duo
eyelash adhesive and the trick for
eyelash it is is you want to wait until
the glue goes a bit tacky before you
apply to your eyelid and it just makes
it so much easier
okay so while my life is dry I'm just
gonna do my face they've a prime I'm
going to be using this Smashbox photo
finish primer water the air fresh
foundation in three hundred in this area
here and then Make Up For Ever HD
foundation for the outer part of my face
just realize my Make Up For Ever HD is
actually lighter than the airbrush so
I'm just going to mix the two together
instead those you've asked me the best
foundation for photography and then it's
the Make Up For Ever HD because doesn't
have any SPF in it so you're not going
to get that white flash back okay so
next we can see I'm using the Maybelline
fit me concealer as you guys know this
is like my favorite fat concealer of all
time
then set that using the laura mercier
translucent setting powder
okay so to walk for face I'm going to
use the sole a pound bronzer by Chanel
and this is the creamy version and I'm
going to take this brush is power to
brush
I actually really like to apply it with
this I know it's a Korean but it just
applies it really nice and evenly so
you're just going to swirl my brush
around in here smelling runnable and
then I'm just going to apply it I think
I'm actually going to use this same
stipple brush to contour I've seen a lot
of people do this
and I'm going to give it a try so I've
never actually used to stipple brush to
contour slightly to the first so I'm
going to use this show from the
Anastasia Beverly Hills contour color
I'm just going to clean that up just
neaten it up which is nice and sharp now
I'm going to contour my nose so I'm
going to use a fluffy brush this is one
that I used on my eyes so then I just
have my Beauty Blender and just go over
that yes my face is cut like a
bit so finishing it off my under eye I'm
going to use this medium sweep brush and
I'm going to use the shade Coco bear and
then I'm going to go in with the black
shade by the Weaver and then apply that
under my eye as well
then I'm just going to apply some
mascara to my bottom lashes so for
highlight I'm gonna take that over
cosmetics you do you highlighter I'm
actually obsessed with this at the
moment like all sets and I'll show you
why
so I'm going to price the mac fix+ to
this brush I'm again using this and
fluffy brush is I've ending brush
because I just
like can you just see why I'm obsessing
this now I mean look I'm going like the
 moon I'm going to use the Mac
stripped-down lipliner
and then I'm going to take over close my
eggs liquid lipstick in Dubai and then
on top of that I want to take L'Oreal
lip cream indescribable
so lastly I was going to apply some of
you are a makeup fixer I'm just going to
spread it on my face that is the
finished look I hope you guys enjoyed
