channel and hello hi if you're new here
my name is Holly bin I'll actually
introduce myself every single video
because there's always new people I'm so
so grateful actually a little you know I
know the intro does get a bit I'm gonna
say no time I say I'm like oh but I like
to introduce myself anyway hello hi
hello anyway so in today's video I'm
gonna be testing out the new fancy
beauty of body lava and the fairy bomb I
brought mine of Harvey Nichols and I'm
just really excited to try it I want to
see if it's worth the money I am a
sucker for a body gun
anything body glow body anything
anything for the body it's gonna make me
glow
I can guarantee you I've tried it or
have it I am just a sucker for it I
absolutely love it it's one of my
favorite things to do and some want to
have a nice tan when I'm on holiday just
it's just my favorite thing
put it on my legs everywhere I love it
so body go anything body blow body
glitter any fact that I'm there for it
I'm down for it and yeah I've tried so
many so many so many so many different
products for body guys so I am just so
excited to try them anyway so I picked
up the body lava in the shade who needs
cloves this is obviously gonna be the
best shade for me then I picked up the
ferry bomb as well because I want to see
what this is like as well I didn't get
the brush I know that she does do a body
kind of a Kabuki brush to apply the
products the reason why is in by is
because I have so many kabuki brushes
and I just didn't that I could just
spend the 23 or how much it was 20 20
pounds on a kabuki brush won't have a
million of them so I'm gonna use my own
kabuki brush for this I mean I don't see
how it's going to be any difference to
that kabuki brush kabuki brush as a
kabuki brush I mean apart from the shape
shape was different this packaging by
the way is so gorgeous like this oh just
screams summer it's just like unreal
okay so this is what the body lava looks
like it looks so gorgeous the packaging
is unbelievable
and the bottle is actually myself like I
know a lot of people were saying that
they thought it would be the same size
to the foundation it definitely isn't
this is it
huge so you get 90 mil of products so
three food answers the price of this on
the Harvey Nichols website is 46 pounds
which actually I don't think is too bad
considering how much product you get I
don't think 46 pound is the worst I mean
I did buy a body oil from Tom Ford once
which was extortionate I think it was
about 80 pounds don't get half as much
product as this so yeah so that is what
the body lover looks like it says blend
into clean dry skin with the fenty
Beauty face and body Kabuki brush which
is sold separately obviously I didn't
get a brush got my own Kabuki brush
which I'm sure will be fine apply
everywhere arms legs shoulders
collarbone any way you want to glisten
yes so that's it's a sun-soaked Sparkle
from head to toe I definitely think this
is what glycerin it which I personally
do prefer more a kind of artistic glow
of the necklace are we're gonna see
whether so anyway it says it's a limited
edition gel based body Luminizer made to
veil skin and a gloriously high shine
finish that feels as cheery as it looks
the sunlit radiance anytime you please
so let's just give it a go okay let's
just let's just get into that let's just
put it on it to see what it looks like
hey I can't I can't find on the website
if this says its place ever sent or not
but what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just
do what relative wish you just put it on
her skin and then buffed it in so I'm
gonna just put some on my shoulder and
then yeah I'm just gonna use my own
kabuki brush okay definitely has a scent
to it it smells really nice that today
it smells really it kind of smells like
those like sunscreens that you put on a
holiday it smells like holiday okay so
that's what it looks like on my shoulder
it is glittery it is good I will say I
don't know if it's picking up on camera
but it is it does have bits of glitter
in it but I'm not mad at it I actually
think it's really really pretty and he's
not too much better as well so so far I
actually really like that I think he
looks really nice I
so just maybe feel a little bit sticky
I'm gonna put some along here I'm going
to put it everywhere as we can see her
inner side so I'm just gonna buff it in
with this brush okay I actually think
that looks so so nice see it does have a
bit of glitter in it but like I said I'm
not mad at that it's not like overly
glittery bit blurry but it doesn't look
like you've got full-on glitz on your
chest it's kind of like a mixture of
glow and glitter so far I really like it
you can do the same
it smells like holiday it smells so nice
I can't think I can't I can't really
think what to describe this Menards it's
almost like a little bit 4-nil of it it
smells like I don't know it just smells
right at Holiday okay so so far I think
that it was gorgeous I'm really really
impressed a bit I'm gonna put a bit more
on why not I'm gonna see how this
product layers I don't know let's just
okay wow you don't need to layer it it's
like next level oh my god Wow I love
this I am someone that absolutely loves
body glow and I love anything body glow
just anything I love it well first I
love putting it down the front of my
legs I just love it I love body guy
especially in the summer just just makes
you a great healthier thing okay so
that's what it looks like
I think it looks gorgeous I think it
looks so nice it does feel a little bit
sticky I'm gonna see if it dries down
it's weird because it feels sticky to
touch but when I have it on I don't feel
like my body feels sticky do you know
what I mean it just feels sticky will
not you touch her okay so I'm gonna try
the fairy balm which is a glittering
pom-pom this was just a little bit like
a tree
okay I don't know what what is this what
to do like what okay so this fairy a
bomb glitter and pom-pom it's 34 pounds
which is that's a lot
look thankful power for a pompom good
air in it is a lot I said this is really
looks like when you open the thing is so
cute it's weird because you can't see
where the glitter is in the pom-pom not
looking at it you can't see any good at
all so I'm just like okay how is just
gonna work
I want to colleges in the back of my
hand so I can see okay but if you guys
can see that let me just so if you guys
can see that boy just put some on the
back of my hand
and it's definitely it just good sir
it's kind of like a rose gold kind of
color it's like yeah it's like a rose
gold okay so it says it's the limited
edition oversize get a trim puff
pre-packed of superfine 3d rose gold
shimmer il rose gold definitely rose
gold and designed for dabbing directly
all over the body okay so it says she
says yeah but well over the body so I'm
just going to put it on top of where
I've already put that okay so I'm just
gonna apply this on top of where I like
that what do you love her be nice I
don't think I want to do this on top of
that because I don't really want to add
more glitter to the body lava because
the body lava already has some glitter
in it so I kind of don't want to add
more glitter with this so I mean this is
nice if you just want a bit of sparkle
on the body but you don't want to use
the body lava I don't know I don't think
this is really worth being honest I
don't really think this is worth the 34
pounds it's basically just a puff and
they put Claire in it
I love this pretty lava and it does I
already have rose gold sparkle in it so
I don't feel like you need to puff to
them for more rose gold Sparkle on top
because this already has rose gold
sparkle in it you know it means how dope
like you need both of them yeah I
absolutely love this Fanta beauty by the
lava it still feels a bit sticky but
only to talk just like only if I touch
it with my fingers having it on the one
who doesn't throw uncomfortable in it
doesn't actually feel sticky like me
just sat here
I don't feel sticky it's only if I touch
it if you're someone that doesn't really
wear like this sir then I definitely
want to get this pom pom pom pom puffy
puff puff thing yeah I think I get that
because it's just fun okay okay but if
you do want a more of a black glowy skin
with a tiny bit of glitter tiny bit of
sparkle then this is perfect and what I
normally do for body glow which I've
been doing which I have been doing for
over a year now is I use my iconic
London illuminator drops and they mix in
with moisturizer and that gives me just
a glow doesn't have any glitter in it
just gives me a glow and so that's
something I've been different every year
so I guess if you want it to do
if you just want a glow and know better
then that's what I know we do and that
works really really well also I think it
applied really really good with just my
normal kabuki brush this was just from
iconic London but yeah I just think you
can just use your own kabuki brush I
don't feel like you have to buy the body
Kabuki brush that they're selling I just
think you can use anything you want
cause that works perfectly fine yeah
definitely just use your in kabuki brush
I'm sure how could be here uh she's
really really nice as well but if you
don't have the money I don't feel like
it's a thing that you have to get so
yeah if you want it more of like a
sparkle then go for the puff puff puff
puff puff puff thing and then if you
want is just like the glow move a tiny
bit of sparkle then go for the body lava
and if you don't have the body for that
then just get some illuminator drops
will get some type of glowy drops and
put move your moisturizer because that
also works
I'm hundred ain't gonna carry on using
this but it will puff puff thing I'm not
gonna continue to use it or they think
because yeah but probably just gonna
have it sit in this box like that and
have it set on my side because it looks
really nice and it looks really cute so
I'm just gonna use it for decoration but
yeah overall I think that the fancy body
lava is amazing I'm definite going to
continue to use it
so just put the flash on my iPhone and
I'm gonna see if you guys can see a bit
better with the flash on my phone you
can kind of see better we looks like I
feel like oh I feel like in the sunlight
this is gonna be so nice yeah I hope you
guys enjoyed it make sure to give it a
thumbs up if you did please subscribe
