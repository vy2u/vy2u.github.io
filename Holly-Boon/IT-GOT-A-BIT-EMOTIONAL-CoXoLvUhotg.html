youtube channel so today I'm gonna be
filming a Q&amp;amp;A type video just something
more chilled you guys did you like these
videos and you like that you get to know
a little bit more through these so I
thought I would do another one I think
they're good sunday video you know
you're just chilling in beds on the Sun
they're just relaxing I just think these
are the nicest videos to kind of wash
these are the videos that I like to
watch so yeah so I should eyes on
Twitter to ask me some questions so I'm
just going through them debris nerves
are actually annoying me now because
obviously I'm in pink and nudes and then
I'm just looking for you know I was I'm
just yeah I'm not very in it
lift the makeup look and now I need to
change it so just open there just a bit
in your face and favorite a location
they always look a little occasion I
always go to Spain just because so close
to me is like a two-hour flight and so
we just go to that little places in
Spain
that's why did this someone and but
favorite location I would have to say
just a little place in Spain probably
Khalid or would you do a meet-up I
really would and I did the one at the
Clive show live last year with Jasper
Lauren I really would but I just get so
nervous I honestly get so scared to meet
people I don't know what it is I'm just
like I don't know I just find it really
scary
I do you want to do I do want to do it
would you ever consider doing your
subscribers makeup for event
slash videos I actually would like to do
it I think that's a really cool idea if
I could get a subscriber on my channel
and just did their makeup and stuff I
would really like to do that and that
could be a thing that could be a video
as I'm when definitely if you had to get
rid of one either being contour lashes
browser highlight which would it be I
think probably contour I feel like a
little that contours on the dark and
bronze then I don't mind about contour
say yeah I'd get rid of console on
makeup product that you cannot live
without
I'm now to say one product I thought I
can't live I can't live without at the
moment is my fancy foundation
I love that foundation so much if you're
oily or combination skin you really need
to try it because it's so so bomb I use
the shade 300 if you want to use me for
shade reference but it's such an amazing
foundation and I am addicted like I
can't even Valley I feel like what would
be your advice to someone trying to make
it in the makeup industry via social
media YouTube and competition these days
is so huge I will be honest I think you
choose more about personality rather
than actually your makeup skill i watch
people that aren't the best that makeup
but I love watching them because I love
the personality so I think the view tube
it's kind of all about more to do a
personality obviously you need to like
work on your makeup and try and be
creative and trying to rethink of
different looks to do and really try and
spice it up as much as you can but I
would say YouTube is more to do with
personality and just show your
personality if people connect with you I
think that's kind of more what YouTube
is kind of about I mean there could be
the most amazing makeup artists in the
world on YouTube but if their
personality is not someone that I vibe
with or someone that I find interesting
that I just don't watch um that's just
me personally might be different for
other people you might just like to
watch you know really good makeup
artists and you know you care about the
personality but me personally I prefer
watching people with I find funny or if
I'm interesting or just anything like
that and the competition is very high
it's very crazy I'm gonna lie and
there's a lot of pressure to always
switch rpenter you know I always try to
think outside the box and you know it's
always new products to try and there's
just it is a little bit crazy sometimes
and and then I just say try and be as
creative as possible
I'm just tag tag tag tag tag tag bronze
tag you know if you do inspired looks my
people tag them hope if you don't see
and they'll comment just keep trying
keep trying keep fishing and I feel like
if it were if it if it's meant to be
it'll beat you don't I mean how many of
you besties yes we got another than
who is your inspiration to start YouTube
it was actually Norman Curtis said this
a few times I so if you've watched a few
of these videos you're gonna be like I
already knew that and but yeah it's
Lauren Curtis I used to watch her
religiously when I first found YouTube I
didn't find YouTube that long ago
obviously a few years ago but I mean you
should been around for years like makeup
shows and stuff and I had no idea so
yellow ink is I still would turn I think
she's so cute who or what inspires you
to do makeup apart from the fact that
you're insane in it thank you so much um
I just I don't know I think it's just
popping - my head's like I'll be laying
in bed with time watching a film and I'm
like laughs for some makeup look so I'll
put it in my notes on my phone and just
so I don't forget it and and because
I've always because I'm so blessed I'm
so lucky to be on PR when they send me
like new eyeshadow palettes and I look
through the colors I just think it's
popped me some and I'm like I wouldn't
use that color only is that kind of like
what can I do and that kind of thing so
I think it helps it there's always new
palettes and there's new products coming
out and that really helps me inspiration
least favorite makeup brand and I want
to say I released her makeup brand
because there's always some things from
sombras I don't like and there's other
perks I like so overall I went since
then you put up any brands I'm like
that's my least favorite brand you know
what I mean
favorite show at the moment I love
watching things like detective things
and like just like crime stuff and I'm
just a bit of a weird eye
I like watching like murder
documentaries and things I'm just yeah
obsessed it's just a bit where like I
feel like if I was very intelligent
because unfortunately I am dyslexic so
I'm not the most intelligent person um
but if I did well at school I went to be
forensic scientist but I just yeah no no
um but yeah I love what like I've been
watching the me and Todd watch the road
detectives all the time and there was
like a season two just came out on
Netflix and there was like loads of
episodes I've just been watching them
and I just love anything it's like crime
or
very fascinated how these kind of like
murderers how their brain works and
stuff because I don't feel like as a
normal person you would ever be able to
murder someone do you know what I mean
so I just don't understand and I just
want to understand like why they do it
do not I mean I'm very like I get well
into it
what did Todd's and oranges jobs they
seem like they really support you which
is so not me to see I think here they do
that the best I love them both and Todd
is an Account Manager and Lauren works
in an office to have sort of like I
don't restaurants she'd want me to say
so I'm gonna say she works and operates
but if I have really good jobs what
would your dream wedding be like curious
low do you know what it sounds really
weird because I'm a very girly girl but
I've never actually thought that much of
I I think it's cuz I hadn't met anyone
until I met Todd before I met Todd I
never ever was like I'm never getting
married like that I'll get married
and then I met Todd and now I'm like
it's weird because even my life before I
met Todd I was like I don't think I'll
ever have kids because I was very cold
it was a very cold person so I was like
I don't think I'll ever have children I
don't even like that I'll get married
and now like I'm gonna Todd I'm like can
definitely see myself when years to come
like having a family and stuff and
actually getting married I think until I
need to plan it I don't know do you not
I mean I'm happy just get married I
don't I think sometimes it's all a big
like show and it's all a big like people
spend all this money and it's like it's
not always about it's just about like
Harless day is about so having a special
day to remember but I think some people
just go so overboard of it that they die
actually end up enjoying it do you know
what I mean and I don't know I don't
know until the time comes what I would
do
honestly how do you keep the motivation
to film videos at the beginning I think
the beginning is the best bit and
because I had so many ideas so that for
me was like you know I haven't put
anything out there so I've got like 101
million ideas I could do could do purple
smokey eye candy browser IKEA as I can
do this I could do that I can do this
Joey means I had so many
idea is at the start so I feel like at
the beginning it was like a lot easier
for me to be inspired and have all these
ideas and then as time goes on and you
you know you keep doing on these looks
and you're like I like to be very
creative I like to use a lot of color I
like to switch it up all the time and I
feel like most people don't want to
watch that so it's it's hard because I
want to do content you guys want to
watch so I kind of just go off of what
gets the most views that kind of gives
meanings that okay well they really
enjoyed this video so then I'll do
something like that again because
obviously we put content out for
ourselves but at the same time we do for
you lot as well like that's what we are
like we're here to entertain you guys or
you know teach you guys something might
remain couple Weber so we want to put
things up that you guys want to watch so
and now I find it a little bit more I'm
trying to hold back on what I want to do
and give you guys what you want to see
did you sit was in who your favorite
influences makeup or otherwise my
favorite youtubers I would say I love
Alfie and Zoe's vlogs and their content
I really like it I just love their vlogs
I think they're just cute of them makeup
wise I love Sean Ingram and I said this
before I love her she makes me die she's
so funny and I just think she's so
curious of it I love Michael Finch he
makes me die hey I've been watching a
lot recently Amanda and Xing love far as
well um sorry I kept looking over there
because there's something hanging on my
door I don't know what it is I'm really
confused
yeah watched over youtubers I hide and
think honestly my my subscription box I
pretty much work all the time
I just I'm obsessed with future but
watch it every single night I get in bed
I have a bar shower every day
get in bed I don't put a TV on I put my
laps of want to put YouTube one on my
yes you do you still read the secret
that book changed the way I look at life
and other
similar books you'd recommend yes I did
read the secret and I've read it a few
times I've also listened to it a few
times on audio audio book I've also
watched interviews about the secret
whether it be the celebrities and stuff
um I just sort of this because it's
definitely changed my life it changed my
whole outlook on life it changed
everything so if you haven't heard of it
I definitely recommend checking it out
it's just a life changer it's just a
massive iOpener as well and similar
books I read all the time think Think
and Grow Rich and it's not just about
being rich or getting richer webbie's
it's more to do with being successful so
whether that be you think having those
money has been successful or being
really happy as successful or just
whatever you class the success it's all
kind of in that book and I'm ready now
to time from reading it again now
actually I've started it again but I
just I just you know you just about you
have to read it a few times to take it
everything that's why I write it so many
times but um yeah Think and Grow Rich is
a really good book as well are you go to
the P Louise event I'm gonna try and
make it in January I love her so much
and she's such a hard-working boss bitch
and if you don't know who pillow is his
page she's just inside it she's just
incredible
yes I'm gonna try my best to make it but
I have a lot going on in January so I
don't know if I'm gonna have the spare
time which is annoying but fingers
crossed
I'll be able to make it because I really
do want to be there for her for the
launch of her eyeshadow palette it's
just yeah she's I know she's worked so
hard in it because she was been talking
about talking to me about it and when
she like first started doing in its
eight years ago so I know she's been
working really hard and long on this
product side this eye shadow place I
think it's gonna be so bottom and I kind
of wait to try it
Cadbury Sun or makeup you have to live
without one forever I'd have to live it
back up with song because I couldn't
live my makeup I just couldn't but you
guys know how much I love Capri Sun like
to the point where I drink it too much
and I get so hyper from the sugar in it
and sometimes like sugar free and then I
had some in Spain and I was like
literally was him I just love them what
jobs did you have such where did you
work before you did YouTube I had semi
jobs so when I left school I went to
college when it starts college and then
I worked part-time at Argos on the
collection when sick love bit um
item number 685 chill connection point
please I don't like at Christmas I'm not
going I don't like at Christmas B so
many people in there trying to buy
presents an idea should be so stressed
out but yes I went part-time at Argos
and I worked part-time at Burger King on
the drive for a while make sure you take
the pair share they would come round let
order a small meal and then I'd give
them a supersize like just lets you pass
it for the window and then they'd be
like are can be combined again and get a
milkshake upright look I need to keep
this job okay I've got no money is to
stop after Burger King I went I went
full-time at a call center and I used to
have to ring up and just leave she
called cool and ring up and see if
people with solar panels on their roof
of the house and try and sell them and
it was just hard it was hard most of
time I'd be eaten and then a phone call
cover and I'd be like cuz like it's
really weird of a courser night you have
a headset on and you're just Chilean and
then you get I could be in your ear and
you're connected to someone and you're
just like low so I'll just be sitting
there eating my sandwich other hello
Charlie
and then I went to saving that company
but I moved to admin say I was admin so
I was more like a PA someone for a
manager for a sales rep manager I was
like a personal assistant I just used to
get coffees and did publish spreadsheets
and that kind of like nothing
excited and then I went from that to I
worked in a marketing department the
marketing department was just for the
whole company so just like a bit of
everything really
then after that I went to claims flight
delay claims so like I was on her delay
flight I would have to
every up the airline trying get
compensation all that kind of oh
wait no actually there was a number job
in there after Burger King I went to a
kid's place in art like a bowling alley
kids soft play and I was like a little
party host the host kids parties anyway
what have you learned this year any
regrets realizing things life well I've
learned a lot this year in like myself
and I'm just trying to be the best
version of myself I'm just trying to
better myself a better person I've
definitely become more of a chilled calm
more loving person this year I I think
that's all to do me and Todd and he just
kind of made me more beloved person
because I used to be like I said very
cold and just very like I hate people I
think yeah this year I've definitely
became I'm just yeah I'm just more
chilled and more loving where do you see
yourself your career in five years time
I'd like to expand on YouTube and just
keep growing as much as possible and
same an Instagram saying reflect that I
want you to watch makeup brand and just
really really work on that yeah I just
want to see how it all goes but I'm very
optimistic and I'm very just excited I'm
just excited how do you remain so
positive even if things don't go right
you're always on snapchat giving it the
most
whereas I will be I'll just give up and
hide on a Michael Brennan Jerry's so
with my snapchat I thought you only see
like a little bit of my day so like I
kind of just snapchat a little bit here
and there and then like I feel like I
wanted to talk to you guys in the
evening when I'm in bed I'll talk to you
guys but I'm not positive all of the
time honestly and some days I honestly
I'm filled down I feel quite sad I feel
like I just don't want to do anything
it's really hard I don't I don't talk
about it too much because I do just want
to try and stay positive and I just
don't want to bring that to
everyone else and put it on anyone else
do you I mean yeah I definitely have
where else I don't even know one girl
upstairs
it's been shooting but I definitely do
just try my best to be as positive as
possible yeah I think it's pretty no
more I mean we all have days like that
yeah do you just think that when you
felt like you just best to just take a
time out just do something to make you
just switch a mood or just do something
makes you happy
where's your favorite Christmas film and
song my Christmas my favorite Christmas

with a little bit of Capri Sun in there
hey John I'm not sure why that who do
you want to win on the celeb advice and
anxiety and could you do a Christmas
gift idea video you don't want to win on
this lap I think it's too early to say
but I do really like Stan Lee I think
it's really cute I also really like it's
hot I know a lot people are free to say
that I like her but I really like her I
don't know what it is I think she's just
like not so I think she's like Oh advice
and anxiety and could you do a Christmas
gift idea video and advice anxiety I
don't even know if I have anxiety or not
I mean someone like that I could do five
nights you've been diagnosed or anything
or one scene one about it so I don't
know Christmas gifts idea video I was
gonna do that actually give this video a
thumbs up if you want to see
idear video gift idea video a makeup
trend that you wish could just die
honestly using certain like materials to
do makeups are like using a shoe to put
your foundational and things like that I
just think it's unnecessary and it's
just like I don't know I don't know why
I've just find it annoying to watch
because some people are so good at
makeup I'm like you don't need to do
that to get notice you really don't and
I think if you start doing things like
that
you kind of become more of a joke and
people don't take you in serious but I
do if I do feel like it's a gem that
people throw out they need to do things
like to get noticed these days because
obviously it's so much bigger than it
ever was and it's a lot harder so that
is all the questions that you guys
enjoyed this video please make sure to
give it a thumbs up and subscribe and
also please comment below you'd like to
see next and I hope you guys enjoyed it
and I'll see you in my next video 5 um</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
