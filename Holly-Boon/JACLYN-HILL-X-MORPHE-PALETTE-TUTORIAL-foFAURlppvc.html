just above the crew I'm going to take my
morphe M 5:07 brush and then take this
shade right here which is kind of like a
ready orange shade and when I apply this
in the crease I wanna see this green
shade was speaking to me I soon as I
opened the palette I saw this teal
greeny blue shade I was like damn I need
to use that I think Jackson H is so
inspiring she's just like amazing and
she's done incredible for ourselves like
people give her so much take and I'm
like why like she's a Queen
that's why she gets ticked because she's
awake because I jealous she's amazing
not honestly she's someone that I'm
attitude a cop - I think she's
I'm just glad back to those transition
colors on this fluffy brush and then
just making sure it's all blended in
okay so after that I'm going to go in
with your green this greeny blue shirt
now his teal color so gorgeous I'm
obsessed and I'm going to use my large
shader brush from sigma e60 I'm going to
pack this on the lid and I'm going to
bring it up into my crease as well and
then I'm going to blend it out and it
will just kind of darken up a little bit
I'll show you what I mean the pigment
the vigman is so good the minute I'm
going to bring it up into my crease here
as well so go back in my morphe m5a 7
I'm going to take this shade again and
I'm just going to go back in the crease
and it was driving up like rain slightly
now flies through my head and see I'm
just going to keep going back to the
transition color giving sure it'll blend
it nicely I'm going to finish off my
whole eye before I move on to my face so
I'm skin applying some concealer I'm
using the NARS radiant creamy concealer
in the shakin jar just going to apply a
little bit under here I press it in with
my finger as I'm going to set that with
some translucent powder I'm using the
Laura Mercier and then I'm going to go
with my fluffy brush from NYX and the
transition color that I use so those two
shades and I'm gonna just run this
underneath my eye
firstly I'm going to go in with this
shade right here on this will be M 5 by
7 and run this close to the lash line
and then you can buff it out I'm going
to use my mac 242 brush and I'm going to
run this really close to the lash line
okay so then for my water my bottom
waterline I'm going to go with the Marc
Jacobs use the gel liners and this is in
the shade blew me away like a metallic e
blue I'm just going to run that and move
on waterline so where's line my lash
line and with some gel liner I'm using
the Inglot jaw line in center cover and
my Sigma es6 brush okay so I'm just
going to apply my last slide with why
apply some lashes so I'm using the
crater lashes in a more I am obsessed I
love these lashes were my favorites
I'm using my Tim your eyelash glue okay
I'm just going to apply some mascara to
my bottom lashes I'm going to use my
L'Oreal telescopic stitching my favorite
for bottom lashes so I'm going to start
on my face so the first thing I'm going
to do is I'm going to apply some of the
Mac strobe cream stride cream in the
shade pink light I'm just going to apply
this to the areas where we're going it
more dewy and more glowy
I haven't we in the two zones I'm going
to avoid that area so I'm going to use
my Too Faced Born This Way Foundation
this is in the shade golden there's six
new shades of is launching on Too Faced
calm on the 15th of 50 opportune and
then six new shades launching at
Debenhams
and Selfridges on the first of August so
there's basic shapes of this foundation
and I am just a spray my face with some
six plus because I need a bit of
hydration okay and then I'm going to
apply this with my M Sigma through D
Brenda
and for concealer I'm going to take my
NARS radiant creamy in the shade ginger
I'm just going to bring this down the
sides of the nose as well I'm just going
to apply a little bit from my forehead
down the ridge in window okay so I'm
just going to set that give my Laura
Mercier translucent powder and I am just
going to bake the size of my nose just
going to leave that space for a hot
minute and then I'm going to take my
next mineral stick which is in the shade
their team to contour and warmth my face
I mean it's not the right shade for
contouring it's way too warm but I like
it don't like those splendor so well by
the way again taking my 3d blender
I'm going to take my other classes of
your hills powder console okay I'm going
to take the darkest shade and I'm just
going to kind of press over where I
applied the cream I just want to set
that I am going to go in with some blush
I just don't feel right about blush
lately I'm going to use my eyes Asya
blush creators in the peachy lab and I'm
just going to use these two shades I
only want the tiny inspect and they of
this product we just go along way and
she has to be really careful because
it's so pigmented and we are just going
to dip my brush into those two shades
but yeah it's so pigmented so you really
only need the tiniest amount and I'm
going to contour down the sides of my
nose I'm taking that same contour shade
from the Anastasio palette and I'm just
going to run this on the front of
windows and then I'm going to take that
banana shade and I'm going to apply this
down the bridge of my nose turn the
front then just some tip here okay so
I'm just going to be that powerful a bit
longer while I do my highlight
so for highlight I'm going to also use
my iconic guns and illuminated drops in
the shade original I'm obsessed with
these drops I apply the deal so I'm just
going to put some on the back of my hand
so I'm then going to use my 3d render
not the one that's got powder on it I'm
going to use a fresh one you don't use
the one you just use power and wrong
because that's just going to be hot mess
and I'm just going to dab my blender
into these and then apply this to my
cheekbone and you bring it around my
eyebrow I just love these so much
because they're just so gorgeous and
they're not powdery they got powdering
liner I say all the time but these are
honestly just so I made them I'm just
going to apply some just above my brow
I'm just going to dust up this powder
take my lip liner my NYX suede matte lip
liner in the shade London white nails
are just not good idea designs they're
white so for liquid lipstick I'm going
to set the NYX lingerie liquid lipstick
in the shade cap cashmere silk so lastly
