favorites video because this has been
highly requested for quite a while and
I'm just gonna talk about my favorite
products of January and also some of
these products I've been using for
months and months and months and then
steal my favorites so some of them renew
and some of them I've used for ages so
yeah let's just get started okay so the
first thing I want to talk about is my
favorite lip colors of the month my
first favorite is dose of colors
chocolate wasted it's a really really
really nice and brown shade it's just
really I find it hard to find it like
brown shades that I like but I really
really like this one so I'm just gonna
swatch things for you on my hand and
show you after so we've got dose of
cottage chocolate wasted absolutely love
that
and I'm also loving its who face and
melted chocolate lipstick in chocolate
honey I've used this for months and
months and months now and it's still one
of my absolute favorites and so I'll
just watch this one on my hand as well
my next favorite is dose of colors does
it suede and that's what I've got on now
and it's just such a nice fellow it goes
with layers of lipid aisle it's just a
really nice news and lastly for that's
not a nude my favorite lip color is the
lip bland liquid lipstick and this is in
Double Down and this is just like a
really bright purple I absolutely love
this okay so this is double duck tumbled
down by lip land you can use my cone
holy Boone you get 20% off and this one
here is desert swayed by dose of colors
so as you can see is a really really
notice of what I've got on now and then
this one is chocolate honey by Too Faced
it's a really nice like kind of buff but
not like really go see I'm not really
mad it's a ring outside sort of cream
I'm shade and then this one here is
chocolate wasted by dose of colors so as
you can see it's a really dark brown and
so yeah these are my favorite lip colors
of January well even now Maria February
but yeah these are my favorite lip
colors at the moment so the next thing I
want to talk about is my favorite
highlighter and it's the mary lou
manizer by the balm i've tried loads of
highlighters I also really really love
the sleek highlighter and it comes in I
think it comes in like a contour palette
you got a pecans of shade in a highlight
shade I broke mine and dropped in
smashed it so anything anyone but my
favorite all-time
highlight out is the mary lou manizer by
the bar and laser people say that this
is like really powdery and it is a
really a powdery highlight but you have
to kind of like it what your brush with
a bit mac fix+
or like some sort of setting spray or
just any spray and then apply it with a
quickly like a damp brush because then
it goes I'm really really nice but it's
just a really pigmented nice kind of
like Goldy highlight you can see it on
my hand well my hair looks huge what you
must have been that like the little
camera thing on my hair looks
massive
but yeah that's my favorite highlighter
at the moment okay the next thing I want
to talk about is the Mac cleanse off oil
I've been using this to remove my makeup
lately and I am obsessed a bit it's just
so nice to remove your makeup with it
smells so good
and it just feels really nice on the
skin like leaves your skin feeling
really soft and you feel like you've
actually removed all your makeup because
sometimes when I use makeup removers or
makeup wipes and things like that
afterwards I still feel like I've got
makeup on my face and I still feel like
there's still like some foundation on
however but what I use this I don't feel
like that I feel like I've got it all
off so yeah this is my favorite thing to
remove my makeup since the Mac cleanse
off oil
it's so my favorite foundation of the
month has got to be the dual air flash
foundation the only problem with is is
it runs out really quick and it's quite
expensive that's the only thing I don't
like about it and but I you shade honey
beige and that was because I was
retailing on holiday so I've got tan
shade
next time once you're going to go down a
few shades but really really love it
just surprised so nice I tend to spray
it obviously if you see my makeup show
isn't then bend over beat you Brenda and
I just think it's so nice you could
build out to full coverage I just really
really like this it's so many of you
guys ask me this and you always ask me
what is not what fake tan no use and I
swear by this fake tan I've tried so
many fakes hands it's ridiculous is the
loving tan and this is in shade ultra
dark so I am obsessed
use this all the time guys really Brown
does the got orange it comes off really
easy like you know and it starts to
going a bit patchy after a few days or a
week whatever and you want to scrub it
off it comes off so easy when you
exfoliate so it's not like one of those
ones where you have to like literally
scrub just give them read forward to get
it off this one is so good and ok I
think all fates hands have a little bit
of a fake tan smell but this one isn't
too bad with that I don't really care
about the smell anyway because when you
wash it off it doesn't smell so I don't
really care about that but yeah this is
the best tan ever the only
problem is you can only get it from
Australia so you have to order it from
Australia if you're gonna do that and
you're like me from the UK just order
like three or four bottles and it will
last you ages then you won't have to
like purchase it for a while for my
sense and but yeah this is in ultra dark
ultra dark okay so I'm
gonna talk about these nails of what
they're one now living for these I'm not
joking I love them and so I used
to be like oh no stinking hands what the
hell no please get my nails done all the
time and it used to cost me quite a lot
like 40 quid a time and then in feels no
like Jazzercise
it's quite it is quite expensive and so
nail her which is I mean by Bellamy
they sent me out a load of these nails
to try and I I'm enough of them I've got
white here one here I've got this color
it's like an orange I had some really
nice nude ones but I
like take them off okay I had worker
then I can tie it with my keyboard so I
took them off and now I found that the
back on the side it sure did to get them
off because they stuck on so your heart
and oh yeah I'm definitely getting the
news once again but there's so many on
the website I'll link it below also
these are only $10 a packet and if you
use my carryin Holly Boone use my name
you get 20% off
I think it's 20% I'm pretty sure it's
20% and so this so cheap and you get
like how many do you get in here you get
more than you get more than oh you get
24 nails you get 24 hours it comes with
a nail file and they all go and there's
loads and then it's different shapes
different nails every one but I am
obsessed with these I don't you think
I'm gonna be getting my nails on for a
while I'm just gonna be using these so
yes okay next thing I want to talk about
I'm doing this in such a random order by
the way is this hairbrush now I as you
guys know you slipped my hair back into
pay as hell and I find it really kind of
a normal hair brush to get it really
slick it tends to get like bumps and
stuff in it so I recently purchased this
hairbrush I've got this from boots I
think it was like three pounds unless
you got it like two weeks ago
maybe not two weeks here maybe about a
week ago and it is so good so you
literally either she sprayed mind if I
hairspray over in my hair and then slick
it back with this and it works so well
and so if you want to get a stick back
to high ponytail then this is the brush
that you need it's been an absolute
favorite - month is the bed hairs
hairspray I have two so this one I tend
to use when I've six my hair back and I
want to just spray and make sure I get
no waste to bits and it's completely
slip back then I will spray this and
then I have this one as well which is a
shine hairspray and this one I tend to
use when I have in my hair down or curly
or something I don't want the curls to
fall out or whatever I tend to use this
one so yeah this one for when I have
sick back pains out and this one for
when I have like curly hair the hoola
bronzer by benefit now I've been using
this to contour and because it's just a
bit oh my god I just dropped that on me
and I'm wearing white great yes this
Bronzite is the perfect shade is not to
bore it's not too cool
it's the such a literally the perfect
shade for pretty much anyone I would say
unless you've got really dark skin but
it's so good it smells really
nice and it applies really well as well
so that is my favorite bronzer to
consult with at the moment and just
bronze up my face so when I was on
holiday I burnt my lip really bad I
didn't even know you could burn your
lips but I burnt my lip and it all
peeled nose then it was so nasty so I
was trying to find something just
anything I was like I'll just give me
anything for my lips because they're so
burnt and dry and nasty I just need to
get rid of this and so I was exfoliating
them all the time and they were just
still bad when I was on the airplane on
the way home I was looking for the
duty-free mag and I saw that they did
this doctor lip lip balm and I was like
okay like that'll do just get that it's
like ten pound ten pound for this little
thing on I got the hell but I literally
have been using this like every night or
just like randomly throughout the day
and you don't have to apply a lot of
baby probably this high knees a little
bit and it will last you for hours it's
so hydrating and it's so good it's one
of the best lip balms I've ever try and
I've tried a lot and this one is
literally the best I think you can get
this at Amazon I'm not sure I bring it
anywhere but yeah highly recommend this
if you're like me and you get really dry
lips or you find your lip like move
druidia
um but yeah this is just everything okay
so the last thing I want to talk about I
shave this half anyone else again is
from several UK or link I'll link with
this but I guess you guys can find stuff
but this is from Surrey okay
living for this so this is one of my
favourite things but lastly and the last
thing I want to talk about is the makeup
geek eyeshadows so I want you to try
this for such a long time if I was
waiting to come to the UK because when I
were to suffer a very crass plate import
tax and it's so annoying
and so these finally came to the UK
finally and these are the shades that
I've got I'm gonna get a lot more shades
I don't know why I've got like pretty
much similar shades and absolutely love
these eyeshadows so pigmented so easy to
blend just so nice love these absolutely
love them I would say my favorite
eyeshadows ever are makeup geek
two-faced and morphe those three
eyeshadows on my favorite I think that
is everything I think yeah that's
definitely everything that is definitely
everything okay anyway I hope you guys
