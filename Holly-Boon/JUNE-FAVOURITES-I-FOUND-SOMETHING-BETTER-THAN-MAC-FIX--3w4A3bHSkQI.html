favorites video just amazing I've been
lovin in June because I don't know we do
favorites videos just because like to
make it as one of my favorite products I
mean far as hi okay you have to be up
here to be on my favorites so I really
have favorite works and that I thought
like I need to talk about and I have a
few this month which is crazy because
yeah like I said it takes a lot to be
what one my favorites seven yeah anyway
we're we get size if this needs to be in
the favorites video okay because these
are on real and I've been eating these
on stuff I just can't do is so good
these are chocolate chip brioche rolls
if you've not tried them then like the
pencil ones
what you do is realized on row okay so
the first thing which took my is nip and
hydrate dragon's blood fix palm plumping
serum do excuse manaus by the way I'm
going to get them throwing up a hot mess
right now
I know she's like a two-year-old nothing
on my nail as a filming it but anyway
this stuff is so good image and told me
to get this my girl my girl someone to
get this and I like do Baba water and
air but then I store in Boots and I was
like yes my girl something to get that
Sun but I get it obviously I trust our
opinion so I picked it up and oh my god
is so good it's so good it's so
hydrating it makes your skin feel plump
from fresh from nice so we're super
hydrated a little bit firm like it
tightens your skin a little bit just
goes made them so this has been one of
my absolute favorites this month but
I've been using it non-stop one holiday
and I've also got tied into this as well
it's so funny I've been getting tons to
wear our iPods
you need to try it is so good nothing
else as well so it says to apply to a
cleanse face and net use morning and
evening before you before your
moisturizer okay so the next thing which
talked about is the Too Faced Born This
Way Foundation I've been using this
non-stop for the last month I'm obsessed
I love it so much it's medium to full
coverage it looks like skin doesn't look
cakey you can build alpha build up a new
citizen at cakey which I love this oil
free and I just love it at the shave
range is so good to put so much
shades so that's what I love about it
the most because because I loved that
L'Oreal True Match and total Club I like
that's my favorite combo foundations and
in fact this is that foundation in one
bottle that make sense so those two
foundations I was mixing together in
truncus or is this foundation but I have
some even that just because the shades
in L'Oreal were just not the best look
alive see I switched over to this and
I've been loving this all month I've
been wearing non-stop also I don't know
what XPS um flashback but I took a lot
of pictures whilst I was away on holiday
with this foundation on with flash and I
didn't get any flash back so I don't
think it's got I don't think it's high
in SPF I'm not I don't actually know I'm
not sure okay next thing is this Anasazi
of Beverly Hills blush trio this in the
shade peachy love I've been using this
non-stop it's so pigmented units you
only need the tiniest bit of product
like the amount of times I've put way
too much of this on them be like oh
because it is like you actually dip your
brush in it and it's like you need to
kind of put on the back of your hands
before you put on your face just because
it is really pigmented and these are the
shades it's kind of like shimmery peach
shade which is really really nice I
don't know we like shimmery brough
blushes because sometimes I feel like it
can look glittery on the skin or
whatever but this just gives you like
that gorgeous kind of like go it's
really nice and then I mix these
together up most of the time so this is
like just like a coral pink and more
alike or anything because I work yeah
but yeah this blush trio in the shade
peachy love has been my favorite blush
for June okay so this next product I
haven't been using this for the whole of
June just because I only started using
it kind of at the last on two weeks of
two years I discovered it because I've
got sent it to me and PR and I thought I
didn't really knew they didn't touch it
and then I just decided one day I needed
a color corrector because my dark
circles under my eyes are really bad so
I thought all I know I'll just try that
benefit one that works then and I love
this so much now my favorite product for
dark circles so it's called benefit
weighing brightening concealer I'm not
sure this is launch Excel oh this is a
new product just like a pink
concealer the consistency is quite
sticky
they blend that really nice and it's a
really full coverage and a little bit
tacky but it's really mean I'm under
concealer as well readers brighten up
your under-eye get some of your dark
circles because sometimes if you do put
concealer on top of dark circles without
color correct then it can give you that
gray and it can still show through the
dark circles can still show through and
it'll just make your concealer look a
bit like I said a little bit gray so
it's best to color correct if you do
have dark circles under eyes and this
one has been absolute flavor and one
this month so yeah this is the benefit
born brightening concealer okay next I'm
going talk about concealer so I did so a
lot of the first sort of two weeks of
June I was using my NARS radiant creamy
concealer I love that concealer and it's
always going to be a favorite of mine
because it's a nice coverage and it
doesn't crease and it just it just works
really well for me and I like the shade
range and but for the last two weeks of
doing that one run out and I was like
sure what I'm gonna go back to my
drugstore concealer because I used to
love this one so much and I was like why
did I stop using this I'm going to just
try it again and see why I stopped using
it and honestly I don't know why stop
using it I think I just got carried away
and started using other things and
forgot about this one but I bought this
again and I've got the shape nude and
this is the Maybelline the eraser I
perfect and cover concealer this as you
can see I look and watching videos and I
only bought this like two three weeks in
a freezer and locomotive is I love this
so much
blends out perfectly especially with
that born so a foundation I've got it on
again today blends out seamlessly
amazing I just for coverage doesn't
crease it's perfect because he is
 perfect so if you can find your
shade in this concealer than you need to
get it the only downside is there's a
like four sides and they're all quite
light so if you're more of a darker skin
tone you're going to struggle which is
annoying because there we need to up
their game and bring up most agencies
because it is such a good concealer it
reminds me a lot of the heart shape type
but for me the heart shape tape I was
using it using using I loved it and
loved it and then it was like not
working with all foundations that I'd
use a stick foundation
like a cream and it will blend out very
well you could see where it was like you
can see where their casino is sitting on
the skin it just won't blend in it only
really works of liquid foundations and
with this I can use it with any
foundation and it just blends up amazing
yeah
and obviously we love the price but I
get through this so much like look on
Versace you have to buy some more of
this because I love it it's perfect and
also I do take the sponge off the top
and then twist and the product comes out
the top there - so dirty and just
because I find this fund on the top to
keep it under my eyes and stuff like
just a little bit I'm hiding it I'm just
not fun so yeah okay so this is always
going to be a favor of mine this will
never leave me it will be with me until
I die this product is this the best the
iconic guns at Illumina drops I know I
use this in every video I know I know
but I can't help it I love these so much
and I'll never stop using them I
recently ran out of my other ones and I
got some new ones and I love them so so
much I like when they need to say then
let you guys know how good these are
like I use them another time so that
iris pits on the back of my hand like
look at this look at this glow I can't
even do I used to shade original they do
have a lighter shade a darker shade and
this is what they don't like and I've
got the one today I just love this
product so much like I use it on its
iron I use a mixture of moisturizer on
my body I use it underneath powder
highlights I just use it constantly I
don't ever not use it like whenever I
don't use it I can tell I can tell the
difference it's just my highlight will
just that more powder is one look glowy
it just doesn't get that product issues
perfect and I've always always been
loved okay so I switched brow products
and that's I'm crazy because I use the
same brow products but it takes like a
year straight I was using their benefit
precisely my brow and I was using the
Anasazi benefit Braille just a mixture
of the two and I never really changed
any of our products I just didn't think
to try because I just had my Holy Grail
I just kept using them but this one from
next has been by my favorite for the
last two last three weeks I've been
using this for the whole of June's
letting discover until about halfway
through June but this is something that
I need to talk about so this is the NYX
micro brow pencil in the shade espresso
and it is so much like the Amazon
developing his brow was like it's pretty
much exactly the same and it's pretty
much is that gives them a benefit
precisely my brow literally the same
product so and this one is I've at six
pounds I think about that I'm not sure I
link it below but this product is so so
nicely but it's really on the end and
then it's just like a twisty one exactly
like the others and yet I used on my
brows again today and this is my third
product okay so this product deserves a
mention in this video because I can't
the card Dale I can't though
this is unreal so this is the Stila and
liquid eye shadows I'm late on these
okay because everyone's going on about
the user Mazama god they're so good
so when you discovered this last month
so I am very late when this products
price on that things were believable it
deserves a mention I'm going to swatch
this and you're going to die because
it's look look at this look at this face
look at this please look at this I can't
they're amazing in my sister's getting
married this Saturday and we did I did a
wedding makeup trial something have
makeup the wedding and he uses on her
eyes and she'd go slay life on her
wedding day okay I just I just can't
look at it I just got this is in the
shade kit in karma and it's like a pinky
shade with flecks of like so over in it
but I want to get more shade in these
because they are beautiful shadows
they're just they go on so well they're
so pigmented if you've got prom okay
it's part of prom wonder what the
you're late on that one I'm so late on
everything if you're going to a special
occasion but waited a got any bright
lights dancing on it gorgeous on your
eyelids or if you're like me and you're
just going to go to Tesco local shop
this will look amazing yes the next
thing I want to talk about I'm not
actually sure if you're surprised
to spray this on top of your main crap
but I mean I did because I wait on
holiday and I ran out of fixed class
once the airport I was like to the girl
map can I get some fixed platitudes like
sorry we sold out
others like you Joe Cheers although
I love it I need to fix stuff in my life
I need a hydration spray like I need
something because otherwise I put off my
makeup just feels cakey and I just need
to get rid of all that excess piled up
and then the woman was like okay we've
gone from urban decay and you can try by
bra and I bought it and it is
 so I was like well okay
great
it's literally I don't know what
it's called but some sort of spray for a
moment it supposed to be hydrating base
not at all and anyway I had this one and
this is from I don't have to say it
Mario Badescu Mario Badescu I'm not sure
that's how you say it
this is a skincare range and this is a
facial spray with aloe cucumber and
green tea and used for for moisture in
front the day or on to sign up for a
makeup application you can spray to the
makeup okay it's fine but this is insane
better than fixed class this is better
than anything I've ever use sprayed this
on top of my makeup and I'm not joking
my skin was one going to this smells
unbelievable and sorry it looked so much
more like skin I'm currently saying that
it was like the whole of my makeup just
kind of melted into one and it just
looks seamless it just looks so good
this is now like my favorite spray like
I am obsessed with this it's just like
you really need the tiniest bit but this
on top of your makeup
forget the fixed class okay I never
proper to say that I did buy some
morphix paucity of a day but
perfect class we're over it six thousand
sixteen thousand whatever bye bye fix
fuss over it can't be asked
goodbye this is what you need this I
can't explain get this and you'll find
me forever and I think it's actually
cheaper than Vicks laughs but just get
this product get it spray it on some of
your makeup and tell me your face
doesn't look seamless
on the row okay so lastly I'm going to
talk about the Mac strobe cream I've
never tried this I never thought to buy
it I wasn't asked and then it was sent
to me in a package and I was like oh
okay so I tried it and I love it
now it's on well this one is in the
shade pink light and to be honest it's a
process of light reflector pink in it or
whatever but it really doesn't look like
you can't tell after all it's not really
much different to the original anything
but it just looks so nice on your
foundation if you want to continue glow
it's your skin and this is really
hydrating re knives just six really nice
under foundation or on its own we've
just like concealer and a bit of bronzer
this is also really nice so yeah this
has also been a favorite of mine in June
so yeah that is everything that I've
been loving it is not that much stuff
because Ivor says to be a favor of mine
I mean it's difficult it's difficult
okay it's difficult to be a favorite of
my arm to four I'm very fussy when I
