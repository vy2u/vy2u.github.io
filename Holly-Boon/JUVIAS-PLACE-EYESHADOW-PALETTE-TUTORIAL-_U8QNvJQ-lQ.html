channel my name is Holly Boone nice to
meet you if you're new here today I
decided to do a look using the devious
place pallets these recently launched at
Beauty Bay and I have been so excited to
use them they're so pigmented so amazing
and I'm like legit obsessed these like
my favorite palettes ever at the moment
so you're going to be seeing these
fights a lot in tutorials now on because
all obsessed and so yeah if you want to
find out how I did this makeup looks
Bennett please keep watching
and also I will link all of the products
that I've used in the description box
below and real quick don't forget to hit
the subscribe button yeah really a
Phrygian 50 K eyelets you can't believe
it
I'm sure I'm Bobby J okay so the first
shade I'm going to use from the magic
palette is this shade right here which
is called banana no I'm never awesome
and I'm going to take my morphe m5o bore
brush to apply this show I'm actually
just going to apply a little bit at a
time but you're just going to focus this
just above my crease I'm just going to
apply a little bit at a time does the
might be gets on your lid because we're
going to carve the lid out of concealer
anyways so doesn't matter what that just
don't want to bring up too high now I'm
going to put it drag it out as well just
because I want to make sure that the
look is seamless now I'm going to bring
the shade all the way in as well we're
going into the inner corner on that spot
any with my forehead right those where
you drive me crazy I feel like it's been
there for like three weeks
these wait off next from the Sahara
and palette I'm going to take this shade
right here which is good Jamelia and I'm
going to use my Sigma e30 pencil brush
and I'm going to just apply this just
above the crease again I'm just going to
start to carve out where I'm going to do
my cut crease so I'm going to start
carving it now when it comes to blended
and apply that isn't a thing a lot of
people struggle because they apply too
much product straight away that you
don't want to do that you want to apply
like a tiny bit at a time if you go in
with like you go home and you go over
loads or for
straight away and it's going to be
impossible to blend it just going to end
up in a mess so key is just to apply a
tiny bit at a time and I'm going to go
back to that fair shade from the other
palette on my morphe employment book and
then when it does some of this over the
top key to blend in as well is you
always want to go back to the previous
car used before
after you've laid down this color and
you always going to go back to your
transition color next from the siharan
palette I'm going to take this bold
bright pink shade right here which I am
obsessed with I would rather learn
whether it's just like crazy so called
as I love it and I'm going to take my
Sigma this is a pencil brush again but a
different pencil brush and I'm going to
take that shade on this brush and I'm
going to do exact same thing again which
is again tiny bit out of time based on
my last video you guys were like I asked
you guys don't wish your favorite
documentary series movies and even it's
crime related or like you know a bit
like action anything like that just let
me know
and you guys said to watch power and you
know what I hadn't I started watching it
as hard and then we just don't know why
we just didn't finish watching it which
is really why and so we start watching
it again and oh my god I like wheel it
she hooked on it wearing on Siri - so
don't tell me what happens okay but I am
 hooked on it I actually can't
stop watching it
I'm obsessed okay so using this pencil
brush I'm going to go back to that bring
G color and I'm going to go over the top
of the pink lightly to help in the in oh
yeah like I'm knitting hooked on that
now so yes that and also I'm going for
your comment
and when I start approaching power when
I finish that and we go through the
comments again and see what else you
guys are suggested for me to watch also
with the whole crisp thing when I was
like call your phone of a Chris how many
people said about the BBQ Doritos and
anything that's BBQ anything barbecue
flavor is a bit of Mila almost yes so I
went and got this vodka doing as an
annulment I'm hope so yep thanks for
helping me out with that as well and
this is you guys always come
really as I'm going back to my
transition color so whenever I lay down
the color I always go back to the
personal go back to the previous color I
need on top and then I always go back to
my transition color as well on top just
to really blend that in back to the
magic palette I'm going to take this
purple shade right here and I'm going to
use my Sigma e o6 winged liner brush and
I'm going to carve out the crease again
honestly cannot get over how amazing
these eyeshadow palettes are have them
on your favorite I love like try to pick
a full shell color for my lid was so
hard because all of these shades are so
beautiful and I was like I don't want to
use that I just cannot wait to try it on
because in this palette so you're going
to prune it see this play a lot in my
videos I'm going to kind of like wipe
the excess off this brush onto my hand
and I'm going to kind of just go over
the line like this this brush to kind of
just blend out a little bit because it
it too harsh okay so we're glad I've
rubbed it in a little bit and go back to
that bright pink color on my pencil
brush Mitch you're going to apply this
straight on top of that purple so I'm
just going straight on top of the purple
with this pink okay
and then I'm gonna go back to my
transition color go straight over the
top of all of those shades okay so I'm
going to now carve out my lid I'm going
to use my Maybelline the erase eye
concealer in the shade neutralized and
my Sigma e 58 brush I do have a discount
code of Sigma which is Holly but starts
when of you rammed it on your throat
once I'm done here but if you only Asian
Sigma D on discount code but I'm just
not having bitch it's like discount a
discount code just type hi charleen if
you want to use it it's that I always
put it in my description box I think
maybe watching and sometimes I forget
how we talked why I do this vixen e3
Sony sign
okay so I'm going to set that concealer
I'm using the Born This Way setting
powder I'm using mine I take my bait
precision brush now for the fun part
I love this part tired dispersed with
some units I love this bit so so taking
the magic color I'm going to use this
food green shadow I mean my mac 242
brush doesn't matter I'll bring it all
the air just going to clean up anyway so
just put it where ever thought you would
take my Maybelline lasting drama jawline
and now I use this one from my tactical
is I ran out of Sigma they don't seem to
want to restock here so I'm over here
with this now and I love it and I'm
gonna use my Sigma ear six brush is the
different one not the same one is the
purple I'm just going to swing by the
dry flippin for over my eye because it
does transfer if you don't let it dry so
I'm just going to keep my eye down a
little bit while I let that dry okay so
I'm going to apply some of the Mac
extended play mascara the lashes I'm
using other Cokely lashes in this side
are more first of all to prime I'm going
to take my Urban Decay rehab makeup prep
and when I apply this on mystic mark
curved kabuki brush she's just like
super hydrating then I'm going to use
some of the professional matte rescue
from benefit and I'm going to apply some
this in the center of my face for my
foundation I'm going to go back to an
all-time favorite of mine which is the
L'Oreal total cover mix with the true
much I love this combination so much the
true match is in the shade golden amber
and this total cover is in the shade
amber I used to use it cover it all the
time then I've got a little bit tans
from going away and now I can't faded a
bit after eyes it's going to match again
so I'm going to mix these two colors
and yeah it definitely matches me again
now zoton from going on holiday over
time and now I can't feed and I'm like
okay so I'm gonna brighten up my under
eye and I'm beneath benefit brightening
concealer I'm going to apply some of
this using my Sigma cream color brush I
just think this makes such a difference
it really brightens up it under our it
will stop your concealer from looking
ashy which can happen if you do apply I
really like if you want to really bright
under eye and you apply really light
concealer under your eyes it can it
really and then I'm just going to blend
the aim of my 3d blender Sigma press it
in then I'm going to take my Maybelline
be erase I can see like this from the
shade nude will do I want to bright
under-eye I think I want to see for
Brian Doris I'm going to take the shade
neutralize which is really light just
feeling it today you know when I have
like pop of color on my eye I like a
repo under actually really like for eyes
of the eye and just make the eye look
pop even more
based on we let that chill watching on
my face for a hot minute and then I'm
going to use my pigments it for my
clinic London the show 4.1 to bronze up
the outer perimeter of my face I'm going
to take my 3d bender okay so now I'm
going to use this point the end of the
sponge to blend in my concealer
okay so how much you tried the to face
balls with powder on my face I've tried
it on my lids I haven't tried it on my
face so I'm going to try baking my under
eye with this and set in the rest of my
concealer and see see what it looks like
so I'm taking a separate sponge not the
one that I used my physio I was gonna
because I'm just going to gust up this
powder is a part of those lives so it's
real heavy
okay so magnetic my mac mineralize
skinfinish in the shade dark deep now
with its fluffy brush from NYX and I'm
just going to go over where I applied
the cream then going to take the morphe
9b palette and I'm going to take this
shade right here on the same fluffy
brush okay now I'm going to finish up my
eye makeup so prior film reggie's will
take my morphe and 504 brush and I'm
going to take that fan shape that I use
which is called Nana so transition for a
lot of use and I'm going to apply some
of this to my bottom lash line basically
the exact same thing we do on the top
and when you do on the bottom
next taking my pencil brush we're going
to take the orange shade jameelah and
I'm going to run this closer to the lash
line taking my the other pencil brush
I'm going to take the bright pink shade
close the lash line again so I'm going
to go back to my other pencil brush and
blend out with the orange so now I'm
going to take the purple shade on my a
oh-6 brush and apply this close to the
stripe and go match the pink I'm going
to go over that I will get it from that
full green shadow quite a little bit of
that kind of going to keep it the outer
corner of my eye and bring it any in
halfway so I want to bring it all the
way in my gel liner and apply this in
the water line you might extend apply
mascara from that kind of in applies to
my bottom lashes okay so for highlight
first of all we take my iconic plunges
illuminated drops in the shade original
like always difference between the
iconic illuminator drops and the an
assaultive of the hills ones are that
for the Anasazi
you have to apply a lot more product to
get it as bright whereas the iconic are
very pigmented see I need a tiny bit
some example but both are amazing sir so
from my lips my lip liner I'm going to
use the NYX way that garner in the shade
sound strong and then I'm going to apply
a little bit of Mac peach stock lipstick
and then on top of that I'm going to use
the next but across in the shade
tiramisu
and they're lovely I'm going to use my
two phase three and one setting spray
this is a primer annotating spray we're
going to right there so even it okay
okay so that is the finished look I hope
