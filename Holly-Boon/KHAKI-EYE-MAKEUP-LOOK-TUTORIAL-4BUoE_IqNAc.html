like a cocky sparkly I look because I
went to Mac the other day and I just
wanted to get some new glitter because
it's that time of year it wasn't like
bitter on my eyes I always want to get
it on my eyes anyway any time of the
year but especially this time anyway and
so I picked up this car key glitter from
Mac and it's called golden olive how
gorgeous is this I I'm just so excited
to you that doesn't but I'm gonna film
it up today because no doubt I'll do it
put on Instagram and everyone black off
did you film it so in a film in it I
have an idea of what I want to do so
we'll see what happens and so for my
eyebrows I'm just gonna use the brow gel
by other star tip of the hills and the
brow is in Ebony
how funny is this might burn my head
here right on the Kylian Tom but it's in
the shape of a play button like look and
then if you guys can see yeah it's in
the shape of a play button why like how
I dance Dan it's really baffling me it's
really like what like I think she just
like was kind of my head so I touched my
head or that I'm burnt in it and it's
like it looks like that I like it going
about the Maybelline fit me concealer
but I found about one the Maybelline age
rewind okay this one's way more for
coverage and it's just that the only
thing I don't like about is this little
bit on the end I find it really
unhygenic like I brought a new one the
other day because I hadn't used on my
other one but it just discussed it and
so I just brought another one because
it's find it library unhygenic the
application of it but let me see it up
in oh I'm not going to carve out my
eyebrow they don't experience
so I think I'm going to use the modern
renaissance run excellent so I'm not
sure if it is a Renaissance writer NATO
about okay I don't know she don't judge
me anyway I'm pretty useless but it it's
first of all I'm gonna take raw Sienna
for my transition color
I don't want to go out for actually more
orange with the car key and then add
some browning so I'm gonna go this shade
right here which is cool Ruger I think
they drive me but I'm just going to use
a pencil brush my Fiat faith but I just
want this to be like right in the crease
okay so now I'm going to go over Brown
I'm going to go over this one called
Cypress boom bah I don't know how I can
I don't know I got confident there but
I'm gonna use this one anyway
so this girl I'm sorry and so I'm going
to use my ash caused my expedito glue
providers on my lid
okay so this is more like a foiled
shadow rather than a glitter well I'm
looking for it I think it's more
equipment yeah it's a Pikmin it's nice a
guitar but I mean it looks so good okay
so I'm just gonna wing my line up and
I'm going to use the Sigma gel liner in
wicked and the Sigma zero six brush I
live for this brush
you
okay so book concealer I'm going to use
that age rewind maybelline concealer and
this is in shade light so we're going to
bend that in my beauty blender
so I'm just going to set that using my
Laura Mercier translucent powder
so to set the rest of my face I'm going
to take the Mack medium pass Studio Fix
perfecting powder love is powered on
this brush is the Real Techniques expert
face brush so I'm going to now use the
give me Sun and by Mac and this stipple
brush duo fiber brush from Lottie lunge
I do believe yep the pecans I'm going to
take makeup geek half-hearted pan this
one here then makeup geek ones are so
good and they're such a good price
so it's come to my nose and we take the
same shade and I'm going to use this
like angle fluffy brush by a iconic
London I'm such a messy cow I've got
makeup all over this table so annoying
okay so I'm gonna finish with my eye
makeup I'm going to take my pencil brush
I'm going to take this shade here first
of all no actually this day which is
called real real girl I mean I thought
about but anyway it's gonna run this
under my eye
I think I want to keep it this color you
know just orange I'm just going to blend
it outside it but it looks really good
with the green okay so I'm going to
apply the Sigma gel liner and wicked in
the waterline and then for highlight I'm
actually going to take the iconic London
illuminator drops first of all I've been
applying these with a Beauty Blender and
just let you put a few on my hand but
look at how good they are minutes you
upset and then I just blend out the
edges
then I'm going to spray my face with the
fix pass just to get rid of any excess
powder on and also to have a file at my
pants I'm going to take the grey cat by
understands your buddy house I'm going
to take this trade here called summer
