filming a Kim Kardashian inspired makeup
look because I just loved the way that
her makeup artist makes her skin XO Juhi
and just glowy and so was just like soft
glam with her like she doesn't really
wing her eyeliner that much like she's
always just got like a really soft glam
so yeah I really was really inspired to
create one of her looks and I'm not
saying that look like Kim Kardashian
before if you start going you can get it
like Kim Kardashian don't you think I
look like Kim Kardashian I'm literally
just recreate and her makeup look okay
so in the photo I couldn't really tell
what it was that she did with her eyes
and I think it was like a soft brown
which is what I've recreated anyway and
that's the kind of impression that I got
from her photo and then the really glowy
skin and the light nude glossy lips so
yeah if you want to find out how i got
this makeup look then please keep
watching just going to primer I'm using
the Maybelline fit me concealer this is
in light I do believe and then I'm just
going to use this concealer buffer by
zoeva
okay I'm just gonna set that using the
laura mercier translucent setting powder
okay in this makeup hardly see and what
she has done with her eyes they just
look very bronzed she takes really Galli
and she's got a really light new gotti
lip so I'm going to try and complete the
best I can even though I don't know what
she's actually got on her own so first
of all I'm going to take my misery but
soft definer brush and I'm going to take
first of all I'm going to take shade
Peach Smoothie as my transition shade
and yeah
so now take you frappe by makeup geek
I'm going to apply this in the crease
using the same brush again
I feel like you can't really since which
you like I said I feel like her makeup
artist is literally just apply like
brown all over her lid a hurry tower in
the fire but we'll just go with it we'll
just load whatever anyway okay so I'm
just gonna go a Coco bear I'm going to
go with this shade here and I was going
to just this all over my eye
you
now going to move frappe I'm just gonna
bring this up slightly higher taking the
e30 pencil brush by face base I'm going
to take shape coconut cream from my
semi-sweet chocolate palette so this
shade here and I'm just going to apply
it to my brow bone okay so now I'm going
to apply some mascara and I'm using the
extended play mascara by Mac just going
to apply this to my lashes before I
apply the fake ones
so for lashes today and Kim's lashes are
quite dramatic in this I know that I
probably her remember lashes because she
has got quite long eyelashes I'm going
to be using the backstage lashes and
these are in at Chelsea these are pretty
much exactly the same as the Aubrey
lashes by Jimmy lashes but I ran out of
them so I'm going to be using these
I'm just going to replace them at Misgav
road to these ashes
okay so now I'm going to start on my
face and for primer I'm going to use the
Nivea for men post shave balm post shave
balm as always
I'm so for foundation I'm going to use
the dual air flash termination and the
estee lauder double wear again I need to
mix Australians together because perfect
hand and this is quite light so yeah
okay so for caseta i'm going to be using
the age rewind concealer by Maybelline
and thence buff that out I'm going to be
using the concealer bra buffer by the
weaver
okay so I'm just going to set that using
the laura mercier translucent setting
powder as always
first got to warm up by this I'm going
to be using the chocolate Soleil bronzer
by Too Faced this is in medium such deep
okay so as we know Kim Kardashian is
that we're super highlighting contour so
it's contour I'm gonna be using the
hoola bronzer by benefit

take a pencil brush I'm just going to
run this down the sides of my nose we're
still going to come to the end apply to
the stain right down the end here
so rush you're going to take the hoola
bronzer my benefit from my under-eye and
the pencil brush I'm going to place it
under my eyes make it out a little bit
just like Kim
now I'm going to go in makeup geek Coco
bear and apply that so now for my bottom
lashes I'm going to using the extended
play mascara by Mac ok see Kim is like
super super highlighted in this picture
so first of all I'm going to start off
using the Laura Mercier peach mosaic
highlighter and I'm just going to mix
these two shades together and I'm going
to spray some mac fix+ on my brush just
to make it a more intense
okay say Camrys like super highlighted
in this area here just above her eyebrow
you say I'm going to spread some mac
fix+ on this pencil brush I'm just going
to apply some highlighter down my nose

highlighted and kuipers way so I'm gonna
highlight that area that okay sign up

this Baby Love shade right here and this
brush is the powder brush by zoeva as a
Kim actually does have some black in her
waterline so I'm just going to use the
Mac and I call apply that to my
