channel and hello if you're new here
welcome hi my name is Holly Boone so
before I get into this tutorial I want
you to just have a quick chop of you
guys you want to welcome to just
fast-forward if you want to see a
tutorial but I wanted to add this in and
so I wanted to say that some people were
saying that they felt like my apology
video was insincere and fake and I just
want to say that I'm very sorry that you
felt that way I definitely could have
approached a situation differently I
just wanted to apologize and I want you
two guys to see how sorry I was without
giving you a ton of excuses as to why I
said these things I understand that I've
lost trust and you guys and you you
don't you kind of think that I'm still
that person that wrote those things
years ago I understand that I now have
to prove to you even more that I'm not
and I will do that in regards to people
feeling like I only apologize because I
didn't want to do sponsorships I want
you guys to know anyone that's followed
me for a while will know I don't take on
many sponsorships as it is because I
didn't start YouTube for money the money
side of things is a bonus but I've said
this before I could win the lottery
tomorrow and I would still do YouTube
YouTube yourself that I'm so passionate
about makeup and just producing content
is something that I absolutely love and
I didn't apologize just because I was
gonna lose money on sponsorships that
doesn't mean doesn't mean anything to me
apologize because it was the right thing
to do and the fall of me hurt people's
feelings like that was just like the
worst feeling ever in the world and
feeling like I'd let people down I am
such a happy positive person now in my
life and when I read those things it was
just like all for attention and I wasn't
in a good place in my life but it's not
something that I can change now all I
can do at this point is prove to you
guys that who you see on YouTube is Who
I am
and just continuously show you that I am
sorry don't think I'm better than anyone
I love you all so much and I don't ever
want to hurt your feelings ever again
and I'll never let you down ever again I
just hope you guys can believe me and
like I said I will continuously prove to
you who I am and who Sione Jim is Who I
am
I don't pretend to be someone I'm not so
for today's video I want you to recreate
the look that Mario did on Kim for the
mecca
he was sitting gabrielle was makeup and
just his makeup is just phenomenal all
the time there was something about his
makeup look they just like blew me away
and I think it's because Kim doesn't
normally have a dramatic lashes or too
much eye makeup so when you did this
look and I was like that's so me I love
a dramatic eye as you guys know and I
just really wanted to recreate it so
that's what I did in this video if you
want to see how I did this makeup look
then please keep watching and I hope you
enjoy it so the first thing I'm going to
do is start with my brows I have got
eyelash extensions on I had them on for
my holiday and I haven't taken them off
because I just I really love them too
I'm just so used to having them on now
um so I'm gonna see how this works
medium a makeup around the lashes it
worked okay when I was away but I didn't
weigh too much eye makeup so we're just
gonna see how this goes yeah let's just
see what happens
yes I'm gonna start my brows I'm gonna
use the NYX micro brow pencil in the
shade black I love this brand so so much
I haven't curly eyebrow hair and it
keeps like poking down and it's so nice
so I'm gonna start by underlining my
brow so I'm just following the natural
shape of my brow and I'm just lightly
lightly lightly drawing a line my
eyebrows are a lot different to Kim's
Kim has agreed to an eyebrow shape to me
so I'm just gonna fill in my brows like
my mom I'm gonna try and make them the
same shape as hers cuz it just won't
suit my face next thing I'm doing is I'm
just going and following like I did
before on the bottom the shape of my
brow on the top and again I'm doing this
really really lightly I'm not hardly
applying any pressure because I don't
want the brows to be too harsh I'm gonna
lightly start to fill in the brow and
I'm just doing a little strokes I found
the exact same pencil was this in
Primark I fly few months ago and
obviously oh my god yes this is only 2
pounds I know this one's cheaper as well
but that one was like too Brown I was
like
that's so good and then every time I go
back in there no they don't have it
anymore I don't know what happened
I got it once I use it been like two
weeks and then I'm about to get one and
they just don't have it I'm so confused
so with this start of my brow I just
lightly lightly go through it
try not to apply like literally any
pressure because I don't like it to look
too filled in so I'm going to carve out
my brows and I'm gonna apply an
eyeshadow base I'm going to just use
concealer I'm gonna use my Laura Mercier
and Florida's fusion ultra longwear
concealer in the shade 3w which is like
a medium warm shade so I'm gonna use
this flat end brush to carve the brow
out which sounds crazy but I've been
doing this and it works really well so
I'm gonna start to just apply a little
bit to my lid and then I'm gonna take
this fluffy brush this is a large shader
brush from Sigma this is the e60 brush
I'm going to use this to just disperse
the product and kind of press it in as
well as soon as I saw this makeup look
the Maria did I was I okay Wow Daleks
insane like that looks incredible he
also did Gabrielle Union Wade he did her
makeup as well for it I was like oh my
god if you're wondering why my face
exodia McCullers I've just been away and
I burnt my forehead no and no amount of
SPF I helped me with my forehead my
forehead got a little bit burn and also
my nose so like so my face is tanned and
then it's like darker and lighter and
where it has sunglasses on as well I've
got like light a bit round here but I
just kept in SPO for my face because I
don't like the fort of age of my skin in
the Sun but the SPF just didn't help at
all I am just going to apply a tiny bit
of translucent powder on top of that I'm
gonna use my Laura Mercier translucent
powder I originally bought this again
this powder because I was in town and I
incident and I though I got nervous yes
I'm gonna get that again because I do
like it but I just stopped using it so I
want to try the ones but this powder
works so amazing with the concealer from
them which is the casino that I've been
obsessed with is the florists fusion
option and I consider this one I have a
that is the same one that I've been
using since I started using that
distiller and it's lasted me like such a
long time I use it like every day and I
still haven't run up and I think it's
about twenty think it's 27 pounds by its
last of me yes so long and especially
with this powder it just works so
anything okay I'm gonna use my morphe
dare to create that you know in a
palette which looks like this so there's
a really good picture of Kim face on
wellhow makeup looks like very smoky on
the eyes and like a nice brownie nude
lip but it's difficult to see what's
actually on her lid there is a picture
here on Mary's Instagram where like if
you zoom in you can kinda see it's honey
bit watchers on it but I'm just gonna
before I think anyway so I'm gonna go
with this shade first of all this big
pan here and everybody is this morphe
fluffy brush and I'm gonna just apply
this just above the crease I'm gonna
just build this up mario's done like a
really nice kind of like a cat eye you
bought like the black all the way in and
then all the way in the inner corner and
all the way up and kind of winged it out
so that's the kind of shaped I'm going
for yeah I'm just gonna apply this soft
brown like I said I can't really see
what she has exactly on her lids like
what Marie did is that be on her lids
but I'm just gonna do what I think
okay so just evened you in a bit because
I just realized she was so far zoomed
out I'm just
we're gonna bring this all the way into
the inner corner I'm just keeping this
in the crease and just above the crease
and I'm just gonna build it up using
that exact same shade if you guys could
have anybody do your makeup like anyone
in the world who would you choose
I would choose I love Sara here here on
YouTube and Instagram I absolutely love
her or I would choose makeup by Mario or
I would choose her ish later through the
I would choose and if I could pick
anyone's doing makeup it would be out of
those three who is you choose it's like
a really warm brown so music this color
right here and I'm going to use my two
three four locks smokey shader brush
from zoeva it's gonna apply this just
above the crease I'm gonna press it on
then we're gonna blend it out so don't
worry about being up where you need
because you're gonna blend it anyway so
I'm just pressing this on and then
without picking up any one foot out I'm
just going over that and I'm gonna go
back to this brush I'm back to that
first shade that is and then I'm gonna
start to buff that so we can blend these
two shades together
this is actually the first time I've
ever had eyelash extensions and I really
thought that I was like maybe not going
to get on with them or like they were
going to just be in the rain because I'm
not person that loves to like to rub my
eyes and stuff and and like you can't do
that with these but I mean honestly I
don't even feel like I have them on and
it's amazing because especially if
you're going away they're great because
you wake up and you kind of look like
your makeups are already done a little
better because you've got like lashes so
I'm gonna use the same concealer as
earlier and the florists fusion ultra
long way but I'm going to use the shade
2 w which is lighter
I'm just carve out the lid and I'm going
to use my Sigma F 75 brush this is gonna
be so difficult with eyelashes I didn't
think I'm gonna bring this up too high
I'm not gonna bring this above the
crease cuz I'm not trying to do it off
the cut crease as such I'm just trying
to carve out the lid so that the the
crease looks more defined this way I'm
just going over with this brush and I'm
just using it because I don't it to be
like a really sharp kind of like cut the
crease but I would just want to make
sure that the lid is lighter so the
critics more defined so I'm gonna use my
Maybelline eye shadow last in drama gel
liner I love this line is like the best
drugstore Oh easy to kind of smoke out
as well as nice and creamy so I'm going
to apply using my Sigma wink liner brush
II go six brush I'm gonna start from the
inner corner I'm just gonna kind of line
the lash line I'm just gonna start off
really thin and then thicken up it's not
just a one but I don't want to go in
straight away with it too thick in case
I don't like it so I'm gonna keep it
thicker on the outer corner and then
thinner as you get to the inner corner
so now what I'm going to do is we're
going to take this brush which is the
lock smokey shader which are just used
for that darker brown in the crease and
I'm going to smudge the liner
so I just finished up the other eye of
camera and I'm just sticking some lashes
on because Kim's got some ready to make
eyelashes in this picture and mine just
weren't enough so I'm sticking some Coco
lash or more so I'm gonna start with
primer I'm gonna use my wire cell towers
primer this one's my favorite it's like
it keeps the makeup on all day it's so
good and I'm just gonna apply this with
my Mac this is like a little stipple
brush there's probably so good at
minimizing pores as well keeps me real
free keep some makeup on it's so good
I'm just going to apply some eye cream
and I'm going to use my ginseng
refreshing eye cream and take a little
bit of this put my ring finger and just
a pilot underneath the eye my under eyes
have just been like quite dry recently
so it's really helped to stop my
concealer creasing and just keeps not
under a nice and hydrate for my
foundation I'm gonna use my Maybelline
24 hour stay in the show Carol beige and
I'm gonna mix some in with the shade for
and I'm gonna apply this with my Beauty
Blender I love this foundation I can't
get off of it it's the best drugstore
long-wear full coverage foundation and
if you only like me it works amazing
with the primer that I just showed you
the white so well as one I know it is
pricey but it will last you awhile and
it's so worth the money because it will
keep you all free for so long here's the
thing when you apply a foundation that's
too light over a patch of skin it's like
darker it can make you look a little bit
gray so I bet up my forehead looks a bit
ashy
because yeah that's why what's on there
but I'm gonna try and fix it with
bronzer on my concealer I'm gonna use my
Laura Mercier flawless fusion
wrong we're like the same one I used on
my eyes this is in the shade 3w so it's
a medium warm shade I'm just gonna play
a little bit of this under my eyes it's
gonna press this in I'm gonna bring it
up down the size of the nose as well
kind of like a reverse contour effect
there's nothing better than when you get
a new beauty bundle like this is a new
one and it just don't know what it is
about a new Beauty Blender but it's just
the best thing so to set my under eye
I'm gonna use this Charlotte Tilbury
airbrush flawless finishes a pressed
powder this is so amazing for the under
eye if you don't like ticularly use too
much powder and you don't want to you
don't want you to feel too heavy under
the eyes this is so perfect
it sets amazing and it just looks so so
nice if we don't get any flash back
anything like that intersects flawless
and I'm gonna use this shadow every
brush as well but can use whatever brush
you want but this I could get the brush
with the powder just because I thought I
would be best but I've got the shade
medium too and I'm just gonna press my
brush into it I'm not gonna wrap or
anything I'm gonna press my brush into
it tap off the excess and then just
press this under my eyes desi Perkins
maybe want to try there so I was
watching her video and she says how much
she loves it all the time she uses it
like all the time and I was like oh I
really need to get that and then I kept
forgetting to get it and then I walked
past a shot at Tobruk stand the other
day and I was like okay I need to get it
okay so before to bronzer blush anything
like that
I'm gonna finish off the eyes so I just
take some of that a show using the
crease that Brown I'm just gonna put it
underneath okay so I'm gonna take my
Maybelline and Jo liner again on this
winged liner is six brush I'm gonna
first of all place in the water line all
along all the way into the inner corner
then I'm gonna start to just go
backwards and forwards and I'm gonna
bring it down anyways take this brush
smoke it out you want to make sure that
you're connecting the bottom lash line
with the top lash line
it's a nun redo bottom mascara I'm gonna
use my Mac extended play mascara it's
just so good for the bottom lashes one
of my faves I did love the bad girl band
from benefit like I didn't absolutely
love that my guys know but I just felt
like I would wear it and then after a
couple of hours it would transfer no I
just get black smudges I wanted my eyes
like a lychee here it's so annoying so I
stopped using that one but I never used
to do that on me though it's so work
okay so I'm gonna do bronzer so I'm
gonna use my Mac mineralize skinfinish
in the shade dark deep and I'm gonna
pick up some listeners fluffy brush this
is from a brand called masked it's a
powder brush it's really good I'm gonna
kind of press this on first before Rob
so don't wanna just have a look
underneath
so for blush I'm gonna try out this
morphe blush palette this is the 8 w
palette I'm gonna go for this shown here
which is mu a but I'm gonna just press
it on the apples and I'm going to bring
it back a little bit as well
the mario has used some highlight on Kim
so I'm going to use this Sephora
highlight that I picked up when I was
away it's like so good and it was so
like Chi but it's so good and this is
the morphe M 501 brush and then she has
like a highlight just above her brow
hair that it also just in the center of
her forehead and she also has a tiny bit
on the tip of her nose I'm gonna just
spring my faces for mac fix+
real quick before do my lips so minimum
my lips with the NYX weighed lipliner
and it's in the shade London on my
favorite lip liners it's like a brownie
nude and then I'm gonna fill my lips in
with this as well and then for the
center on my lip I'm gonna use this
