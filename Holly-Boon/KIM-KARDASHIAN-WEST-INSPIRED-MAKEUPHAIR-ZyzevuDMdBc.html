my name is wholly beneath your new here
please subscribe so today I thought I
would film Kim flashy inspired makeup
lip I saw this look on her Instagram and
I was obsessed of it it's like a nice
soft glam she had the white hair so I
felt like my mother just get the wig do
the whole thing so yeah I got the way
the wigs cheap so don't judge me it
doesn't look great
but anyway I feel like this makes me
feel like when I was 16 when I was 16 17
I had bleached blonde hair like it was
literally this color and I would bleach
it every single week so that it would
stay white and I absolutely a lot of
 my hair up so bad it ended up
being like this long and it would just
mess so that's why you're not going
really dark but it's just funny it's
physical throwback yeah you wanna find
out how I did this makeup look then
please keep watching and also don't
forget to give this video a thumbs up
and subscribe you liked it so yeah let's
just get on with the video so we're do
the makeup without the wig on because I
don't want to get makeup in the wig the
wig is white blond
so that's risky so I'm just gonna do my
makeup without the wig I'm gonna start
my foundation I normally start in my
eyebrows but because my eyebrows are
quite dark I'm gonna go over my brows
with some foundation and then fill them
in really really lightly because I will
see I don't my brows to be super dark so
invest we're gonna prime I'm going to
use my fancy Beauty profile at primer
whenever I this all over I'd actually
love this primer and the foundation for
wearing a foundation a lot recently
because I have been quite weeny and it's
just really slow good I just photographs
so so nicely not honestly I can't even
explain in photos it just looks so good
so you have been absolutely loving it so
then for my foundation I'm gonna use the
Fendi beauty foundation in the shade 300
I'm just going to shake the bottle okay
so the way I'd surprised foundation is
first of all I'm going to dot a little
bit I do like one side at a time because
it just dry down quite quick so I just
like to just do one side at a time and
then I like to take my Mac 130 this is
like a small stipple brush and I like to
stipple the foundation like this and
then once I've kind of done that
I go over the beat you've been the
destination there's no brush there's a
brush stroke marks yeah and then I'll
just go over to my sponge so I said it
I'm putting the foundation over my brows
just to kind of lighten them off a
little bit because they are quite dark
I just loved the way this foundation
dries down like really man you took so
long
okay so then I'm going to take my maybe
the eraser eye concealer in the shade
nude and I'm going to use this sparkly
brush from morphe like olive says these
are the new brushes they do send to me
today I'm not sure when they launch I'm
not really sure but they look how pretty
these are
so I'm just going to leave the concealer
to dry down a little bit before I blend
it in that way you just get a little bit
of extra coverage so I'm going to do my
brows and I'm first of all going to comb
through my brows with the Anasazi
Beverly Hills brow gel I'm just gonna
set the hairs down so then I'm going to
take my benefit precisely my brow pencil
it's in the shade six which is the
darkest one but they actually have a lot
of our products so I'm just going to use
this very very lightly and I'm literally
only gonna fill it in where I feel like
I need to just go through this the brush
and I'm just going to try and rush out
some of the product I'm gonna go in very
lightly in the front the brow there's
always one brow better than the other
isn't that is so named stay at home you
had it she saw Kim in this picture and
I'm like oh my god that makeup the hair
just six on rail so just feel like try
it out for you're not gonna like half as
good as I was but I'm gonna give it a go
so now I'm gonna press him I can see it
on reason my beauty brand up I'm just
gonna bring it a little bit over the lid
as well I am trying to bring my eyebrows
out some like try not spot them it is so
hard it's just so so hard that's what
them
so now I'm gonna cream contour slash
cream bronzer it's not really a contour
show it's more of just like - all my
face up and I'm using the iconic done a
pigment stick and they showed four point
one then I'm gonna take the foundation
brush that I used which is the Mac 130
brush I honey just go all over it with
this brush and then go in with a Beauty
Blender I'm going to take my NARS
radiant creamy concealer in the shade
custard and I'm gonna just apply a
little bit of this down the front of my
nose and while something not too dry dry
down a little bit I'm going to set the
whoa holy I'm gonna take some of
the RCM a translucent powder and I first
still gonna set the under-eye and the
lids I'm just gonna make sure there's no
creases pad
I'm gonna bake underneath where I hide
that cream stick so I'm then gonna take
my studio fix powder by Mac and Detroit
NC 43 and I will use my big brush from
it cosmetics I'm gonna set the rest of
my face as this if you are if you're not
very oily you might need to do this step
because this foundation just dry down
and you kind of don't read you say that
much but I still get quite oily even
though this is okay okay so I'm gonna
press in that concealer on my nose I'm
just gonna apply a little bit of
translucent powder and I'm also gonna
bring the translucent powder down the
sides of my nose
who's gonna fake down the size of
animator that Kim has just got like a
soft look I've got quite a warm brown on
her eyes and then she's got like a like
a highlight in the inner corner of her
eyes so I'm kind of just gonna go I
don't know if she's got a shimmer on her
lid or not I don't know I'm just gonna
go what I think she's got on anyway so
when you use my Anasazi Beverly Hills
Mario palette and I'm going to use this
warm shade here which is called Isabel
on this light fluffy brush from morphe
collection and I'm gonna apply that in
the crease of my eyes
I'm also gonna bring it all the way in
here as well will be the way into the
inner corner and then I'm gonna take
some of this shape violator just a
darker Brown and I'm just gonna kind of
apply this to the outer corner I don't
know this is what she's got on her lids
because you can't really tell you can't
really see that much but I'm just going
by what I would do so I'm just gonna go
with this shade which is v of which is a
cushion Murray gold and I'm just going
to kind of fellow but it's not so I'm
bringing I'm basically bringing it in a
corner of the eye to the halfway dust up
this power of my nose because it's
literally got up my nose it tickles
yeah its nose exposed
okay so I'm now going to just line my
lashline real quick and for his thick
lashes on so I'm just taking a black eye
shadow on this angled brush it's got a
spoolie on the end which again is
running off your collection I'm just
obsessed so yeah I'm gonna just press
this black shadow oh my gosh below and
I'm gonna apply some in the top
waterline as well so I'm gonna apply
some mascara top Rush's I'm gonna use
the Mac extended play
so for my last year's I'm gonna is a
iconic light I think these are the mini
ones the mini light ones but not sure
everyone mini light or normal light come
over and I'm going to use the House of
lashes eyelash glue as well I'm just
gonna let my lashes dry for a little bit
before I stick them on so whilst I leave
those to dry for a second I'm gonna put
some blush on I'm going to use my
California brush by a benefit and this
brush I'll let you know it's packaging
it I'm Scott anyway um see I'm gonna try
some of this I just think blush makes
you look a lot healthier as well
okay so then I'm going to take that
shade Isabel and I'm gonna run this on
my lower lash line then I'm gonna use
the shade Violeta which is a dark brown
shade and I'm just applying this shade
closer to that lash line and then Kim
has got a little bit of black in her
waterline it looks like so I'm gonna
apply it some black the same brush lays
on the top okay so we leave my lashes to
dry for a minute cause the Dutch glue is
still a bit wet so I was that dries when
I set my contour Diaries by pure and I'm
gonna take the banana shade which this
show right here it's called dream and
I'm just gonna put this under my eyes
because I feel like Kim's under eyes a
lot brighter than wine brighten up a
tiny bit more and this brush is from
Sigma is the Sigma tapered kabuki brush
okay then I'm gonna apply some of the
Mac extend to play with SCARA to my
bottom lashes
so I'm gonna use my over on the globe
palette and i'm gonna use this really
light shade which is right here and i'm
gonna apply this theorem where i because
I feel like Kim's got a bit of highlight
kind of like just above her brow right
here and then her nose as well
I don't it over on her chin here so I'm
gonna use this shade from way over
palette and I'm using my Sigma high
cheek highlight brush which is the fo3
and I'm gonna apply some to my cheeks I
don't know if she's got this one her
cheeks but I'm gonna apply a little bit
there so she's got a little bit here
front of her brow and they just got a
bit on her chin here I don't if this is
highlight or if you swear she's produced
a bit of oil but desert she looks kind
of glowy my nose and then also just here
literally just there so I'm just gonna
spray my face with some of the Mario
Badescu facial spray of cucumber and
green tea just to get rid of all this
excess powder on my face so I'm going to
first we use my NYX lip liner this is in
the shade sugar glass looks like this
okay so then I'm going to take the NYX
butter gloss in the shade and add a lot
