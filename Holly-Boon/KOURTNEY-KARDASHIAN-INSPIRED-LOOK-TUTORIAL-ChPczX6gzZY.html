filming a Kourtney Kardashian inspired
makeup look I know I've done Kylie
Jenner I've done Kim Kardashian but you
guys seem to absolutely love these
videos you always ask me to do
Kardashian inspired looks and I'm not
complaining because I absolutely love
their makeup art is why they do the
makeup but just I'm obsessed so purchase
this top from Urban Outfitters and it's
got like the holes in it and stuff and
it just made me think of a Kourtney
Kardashian shoot that she did with the
ripped t-shirt and then really nice
bronzy makeup look so it was a
no-brainer I mean I have to do the
makeup look because I mean if I didn't
then I'll just be sure of me so today is
going to be the Kourtney Kardashian
inspired look I hope you guys enjoyed
the video
make sure it's give it a thumbs up if
you do and please subscribe if you
haven't already and but if you want to
see how I got this look then please keep
watching
so I've rigid up my eyebrows as you can
see and I pride why I using the
Maybelline fit we can see you like I've
just set that with some translucent
powder and so Kourtney Kardashian has
got really brown smokey eyes that's
basically one wouldn't be doing
obviously and she's got very lanzi skin
so I'm going to be using the Too Faced
semi-sweet chocolate palette because I
haven't used this in a while or and I
used to use this all the time I don't
know why I've stopped using it and I'm
just going to take my fierce face
tapered blending brush and I'm going to
be taking show you peanut butter which
is this light brownish shade and just
apply that as my transition color
today so I'm just going to take shade
frappe by makeup geek so this shade him
just going to apply that in my crease
and because I'm going to use a dark
brown all over the lid and it's just
going to help make the colors burned out
better
okay then I was going to take my Kiko
eyes 200 Russians going to blend those
two shades together so next I'm going to
go in with shade coconut cream which is
this side here just going to apply that
to my brow bone also if you wonder where
I got this top from it's actually from
Urban Outfitters and I saw it and I was
like I'm pretty sure Kourtney Kardashian
was wearing like a ripped t-shirt and
one of her pics on Instagram and I was
obsessed with her makeup so I was like
I'm just going to recreate that look and
I was going to take my locs petite
crease brush and shade truffled this
dark brown shade I'm just going to apply
that all over my lid
then we're going to take my tape a
bending brush by fierce face and just
blend that
okay so now I'm just going to apply some
mascara before I apply my lashes and I'm
going to use the Mac extended play
mascara and the lashes I'm going to be
using are the House of Russia's ikonics
I've had the same pair no joke a worn
knees about 15 times probably and
because all I do is I get a makeup wipe
and wipe the excess mascara off and
cleaning them and then you can just keep
reusing them
okay whilst the lashes it dry the glue
does dry clear and then I'll just go
over it I'm going to start on my face
makeup so if a primer I'm going to use
the Smashbox photo finish primer and
then I'm also going to use the NYX pore
filler just around this area here to
minimize my pores and I have actually
been really loving this I got this when
I went to Manchester was it last week a
lip for such a bad memory or fingers
last week and I love really like that
used it a few times and I'm quite
impressed by Ashley
so for foundation I'm going to be mixing
the Make Up For Ever HD foundation with
the Marc Jacobs remarkable foundation
and the reason for this is that I've
used the Marc Jacobs a few times I've
used it quite a lot and I've got to the
point where my skin and because it's
such full coverage and it pretty much
dries matte like really matter to the
point where you don't even need to set
it it just kind of made my skin feel
start getting a little bit dry and
that's kind of weird for me because I'm
really oily that around this area so
I'll mix the two together and perfect
I've had the perfect foundation so the
Make Up For Ever HD foundation this is
in shade y31 5 and the Marc Jacobs is in
shade honey medium and also this one is
slightly too dark so mixing them
together works really well from it
I think about these beauty vendors it
annoys me is they always look really
dirty like I got this like last week and
I've washed it this morning I've washed
it about four times this happen here and
it's just still got foundation stains on
it and I've used addy backwash I've
tried absolutely everything and it's
like so hard to get the stains out with
and then it just makes you look really
dirty so you know one thing I just hate
about beauty blenders so if we conceal
I'm going to use the Maybelline fit me
concealer as always my absolute favorite
I don't think I'll ever change now I'm
obsessed with this concealer I just
highly recommend trying if you haven't
already and this is shade 20 I normally
don't know the shade but I'm because I
bought a new one
yesterday still got the number in it so
it's number 20
now set that I'm going to use the laura
mercier translucent setting powder as
always
so now just going over where I've set
under my eyes I'm going to go over it
with the Ofra Cosmetics banana powder
and this is just to add a little bit
just to brine it a little bit more just
so that I get that flush back that white
flash let me take a photo and I'm just
applying this with the highlight brush
spies the wafer really like I've never
found a banana powder that I've actually
really liked I've used the Ben Nye
powder and I'm just it's just too cakey
for me and it just feels too heavy on my
skin so I don't like that one but this
one have been absolutely loved in they
now for bronze bronzer I'm going to take
these Chanel bronzer and the brush by
the Weaver this is called the 106 powder
brush and this is kind of like a creamy
bronzer I just tend to slow my brush on
it and then apply and it just surprised
very nicely but I had this bronzer it's
quite crazy but I've had it since
December and I've hardly used like any
but it literally will last you forever
okay so it's cons I'm going to reason
Anastasia Beverly Hills contour shade
and this is in Java I'm just going to
use this stipple brush to apply it with
a blush I think I'm going to use this
shade here because it's not too pink
which is I will always live here and I'm
just going to use this Mac fluffy brush
I don't know what the number is this
warning
so now I'm just going to finish with my
eyes before I finish off my vase so it's
gonna replace the mascara quickly then
I'm going to take my zoeva luxe petit
crease brush and shade truffled
actually first of all when I take shade
peanut butter Oh which is that shade
right there I'm going to take that and
apply that onto my eye
and then I'm going to go in with shades
ruffled which is that darker brown shade
which is the one that I applied it all
over my lid and apply that again to my
bottom lashes
okay so Courtney has actually got some
white in her waterline so I'm gonna take
the pure white creme align by Mac and
I'm just going to apply this in my eye
light in my waterline using the Mac -
what - bra using this brush
and I'm just going to step that in my
eye because I don't want it to wear off
I'm going to take coconut cream from the
Too Faced palette and just apply that on
top of that okay now I'm just going to
apply some mascara to my bottom lashes
if you've got quite similar eyes the
best things for you to do is to add
white in your waterline because it just
makes your Isaac so much bigger so
that's just a little trick if anyone's
got really small eyes if a highlight
he's mary-lou manizer by the balm
Kourtney Kardashian isn't very high
light I didn't have fire but I like to
have highlights I'm just going to add on
my life but she's actually quite matte
yeah she's pretty matte in that photo
but I'm just going to add my life
because I need it okay so I'm
just going to use the mary lou manizer
by the balm and I'm going to use the
locks highlight brush by Zoe bar I'm
just going to spray my brush just to
intensify Mahina a little bit more
because you know you need to be
down like me
I remember ages ago when I used to
purchase the bomb and it used to be so
inexpensive like it didn't used to be
that expensive at all I remember I used
to get this highlight at this
highlighter for about 12 pound and I was
in Boots in Manchester the other day and
they've got like a little but the bomb
counter type thing and I was like 17
pound like I've never paid 70 pound for
this right my lip color so I'm going to
use I'm going to be using chocolate
wasted liquid lipstick by dose of colors
originally just got the huge of u-e lip
contour and I do believe this is in
shade vixen so I thought this would be
like a really good match from what this
liquid lipstick this was the only car
that I had left I was too late
purchasing I didn't manage to get the on
colors which ones haven't got it about
but yeah I'm gonna beat this is the
first amusing this is what I haven't
actually used this yet it literally came
yesterday so annoyed
by
is that just
so I'll see I'm just going to spray the
Ofra makeup fix on my face so that is
the finished look I hope you guys
