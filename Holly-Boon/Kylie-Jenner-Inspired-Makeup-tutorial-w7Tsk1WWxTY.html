eyebrows just because mine are so
different to Kylie's and I thought it
was save a bit of time if you do want to
find out how I do my eyebrows I already
have a tutorial on my channel so to
start with I'm using the Revlon
Photoready perfecting primer I
absolutely love this primer at the
moment and it is such a good price so
for my foundation I'm using the Mac
Studio Fix fluid and I'm just applying
this with my Beauty Blender the reason
why I'm using this foundation today is
because it is very matte and Kylie it
always has a really really matte face so
yeah also this foundation does look
really really dark against my natural
skin color and it's purely just because
I've got fake town on so I figured I'd
use a dark foundation
so now to highlight I'm using the eraser
iperfect and cover concealer by
Maybelline this is in light I absolutely
love this concealer it's such a good
price and the consistency and cover is
just amazing so if you are looking for a
really good concealer for a really
really good price I can't recommend this
enough and again I'm just using my
Beauty Blender now just to blend this
all in
now I'm just using my Anastasia Beverly
Hills cream contour kit and this is
shade cinnamon if you guys watch my
channel you'll know this is my favorite
thing to contour with it's so easy to
blend and the finish is just amazing
and again using my beauty blender to
blend this in a lot of you guys things
that I use my Beauty Blender dry but I
don't I actually do use it damp so I'm
really sorry for not actually making
that clear but I do make sure that it's
damp if you use it dry it's just not
going to work also I will link below
where I got my contact lenses from and
they are super super comfortable and if
you guys have dark eyes like me and you
find it hard to find contact lenses to
cover them and these ones are absolutely
amazing
and now I'm just taking my Mac setting
powder and just to map out my face
because Kylie's makeup is always really
really matte next I'm just taking shade
banana from my contour palette and I'm
just using this to neaten up my eyebrows
and to highlight my brow bone
now just to prime my eye I'm just using
the Mac Paint Pot in rubenesque
it's a really really nice gold so it
works really well for this look
so for my eyeshadow I am actually using
the 17 shimmer brick it's really really
good price and the colors really
pigmented so it works really well for
eyeshadow and Kylie has a really really
gold eye in that makeup look so I am
just going to go crazy with the gold so
first of all I'm just using my blending
brush and I'm just working the second
from darkest shade into my crease and
the outer corner of my eye and now I'm
just using a fluffy brush just to blend
that all in and just to make sure
there's no harsh lines or anything and
now I'm just using the darkest shade and
I'm just working this into the my crease
and but not all the way across my crease
and the outer corner of my eye now I'm
just taking the lightest shade and I'm
just highlighting the inner corner of my
eye
now taking the darker shade I'm just
using this underneath my eye and because
Kylie is very bronzed under her eye
now I'm just using a Max Factor mascara
I'm just applying some mascara to my
eyelashes before I apply my false
eyelashes because it always makes it
blend a lot better the lashes that I'm
using are the long lash from several UK
if you watch my videos you'll know I'm
obsessed with these and they're the only
eyelashes I ever use I will link them
below for you but yeah absolutely
obsessed with these eyelashes I always
make sure to apply my eyelashes tacky so
I blow the glue before I apply them if
you do apply your eyelashes and when the
glue is really wet it's going to be
really really difficult for you now I'm
just applying some mascara to my
eyelashes just to blend my natural
lashes in with these false ones and I
always do this just because it gives
more of a natural look
so now I'm just using the MUA intense
color lip liner and this is shade
caramel nugget I'm just using this all
over my lips
I'm now taking shade nude from the cream
contour kit I'm just applying this to my
lips to add more of an orange tone like
Kylie's and to lighten my lips a bit
more now I'm just applying some of my
Mac setting powder to my lips just to
map them out and that's the finished
look I hope you guys enjoyed this video
and I will see you again next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
