channel and hello hi if you're new here
my name is Holly Boone so I thought
because it's Sunday it's a nice chill
day I hope most of you it's a nice chill
relaxing day if you're working I mean
get your point 100% but I just thought
I'd do something a bit more chill and
just sit and talk to you all and answer
your questions because I have a lot of
Q&amp;amp;A in a long time it feels like I can't
member lost so much as well and yes I am
fully be fully beep face sitting in my
bed because I did just film a Instagram
tutorials so if you want to see how I
did this I look check out my Instagram I
might post that I might not present my
like this situation it's like I always
like go to film Instagram tutorials and
then I guys edit them and my lighting is
just so one minute I don't really Orange
in the next minute I look really
overexposed and I just I'm not a
technical person I just don't have to
sort out so yeah okay anyway okay so the
first question is from Chelsea Hannah
hey girl how did you work up the courage
to do YouTube video love you love you
too um honestly I feel like I got to a
point when I wished think of a what
about me so I was like you know what the
so not everyone Jason's gonna do it and
I did get taken the piss out of when I
first did it like from an area post or
whatever their Facebook and was like I'd
rather watch paint dry and just
absolutely rip the out of me but I
think I'm a but I honestly I just
think it's your life and you should do
what makes you happy
and try not to worry about what anyone
else thinks I think a lot of I think a
lot of people hold back from doing what
they want to do because they're too
scared of what people are going to say
and people are gonna do whatever and I
know it is really hard to ignore it okay
it's really hard to ignore what people
are saying stuff but people who talk
 about you no matter what you do
like you could go and donate a million
pounds to charity as someone was they
need a different tension or someone
would say something bad about it like
you can do it like you could do so much
stuff and people will always have
something to say no matter what you do
so yeah I just think do whatever you
want to do everyone else it's
really funny because the people that
used to take the piss
when i first ID'd you are the people
asking me questions and I'm just like no
next the next question is from Bobby
Martin and she said where do you see
yourself in five years I love that name
Bobby frog r3q anyway where do I see
myself in five years hopefully a million
subscribers hopefully a million of you
guys I don't really know like I just
want to fulfill this as much as possible
like I just want to work really hard and
produce as much content as possible and
grow as much as possible and you know
I'm on the right path like I love what I
do so much and I'm so so grateful for
just all of you and just this whole
thing so I just want to keep doing it
keep doing it keep doing it since I just
never want to stop doing it I'm putting
news if I'm 90 years old when I'm 90
years I don't want to sit here do makeup
tutorials nothing but I I get my
granddaughter in she's not I mean get my
Grenn's oh I get my grandson everyone in
sweet you're so good and so the next
person Elizabeth Pamela I think that's
how you say her surname which is such a
nicer name and if you could do a
collaboration of any makeup brand which
brand would you pick you know what I
don't know and I have had a few offers
from brands to collaborate on a product
and I just feel like they kind of just
want to make as much money out of you as
possible and they do offer you a good
amount of money to do it but I you could
offer me really imbalance and if I don't
feel like you respect me as a makeup
artists and you I've generally
interested in me the person and my
content and who I am and you just want
to make money off me I'm not interested
you know what I mean
and that's just what has been calm down
- to be honest I mean I still live with
my mom with a house like in this tiny
little room with no space but
I'm not going to take you know if I took
all these jobs and if I took always
watch it and if I took all of this
opportunity I would have my own house by
now I would you know I mean I have my
own house I'd have everything right now
but I'm too
my reputation and you guys means more to
me than anything and I'm not gonna let
someone come to me around to come to me
with this opportunity just because they
want to make money off me as well but
actually interested in what I do and you
know my love for makeup and stuff so I
just I don't know I think a lot of times
makeup Browns just want to stick their
name on something
I know these businesses are here just to
make money that is all they wanted to do
is just make as much money as possible
it's a business though but I just would
rather hold off on that and I'm just I
don't take every single opportunity that
comes my way I do get a lot of
opportunities and I don't take them all
because all I really care about is
creating content and you guys and the
money side of things is a bonus it's
about to do bonus that this gets to my
career and gets me my job my income but
it's not what is this is all about I'm
not taking every single opportunity just
because I want ice and ice and money do
you not I mean I'm happy to stay in this
little box room for as obviously long as
I have to stay here yeah so Brooke wood
wood wood wood
that's a six-hour wood wood wood wood
and we all know you love making YouTube
videos but if it wasn't doing that what
would you what do you think you would be
doing love you so much I love you too
and I think I would try and pursue more
music because I was doing music before
YouTube and I kind of gave up on the
reason because it was so like I was in a
girl group and the struggle was
absolutely real because in my industry
it's so competitive and everyone wants
to be like that bleed singer everyone
wants to have this part in that part and
you know it all got a bit like hate
people wouldn't turn up to rehearsals on
time and other people get pissed off and
I was driving backwards and forth to
London and like mill Keynes and
everything it was just like it got to
the point where I wasn't enjoying it
anymore and those would drop out the
bands would have to rerecord the whole
track of a brand new band member
we'd have to audition more band members
and then it's all that kind of stuff
that happened before four times girls
left when he started to get a bit
serious and you know and the pressure
was on
these girls can't take it and they
dropped out and then we'd have to get
more girls in and then you have to fight
those girls and then have to re-record
everything and it has got to the point
where we just going backwards on fourth
concert and I just was like you know
what they think for me I can't I can't
waste my time doing this it was just
getting a joke and it was costing me a
lot of money which I didn't have I was
working a job plus doing that and it was
just all of my money was just going on
it and it was just like wasting my time
do not I mean I still love those guys
like we still I still touch them every
now and then like I love those girls to
death like even though like we had the
arguments and stuff when it comes stands
like people being late for rehearsals
and whatever we still got and we still
got on like we still loved each other
like we had like a good good
relationship so the next person a nice
bowler lesson is that right and the
question for you Q&amp;amp;A do you want kids
when you get older and when do you throw
the rights when do you feel the time is
right if so how many what would you like
to call them DUI tradition traditional
names or unique names so I definitely
want to have children when they get
older 100% I could do our family and I'm
sorry oh it's set in my like on like my
career and everything it's like
developing whole YouTube channel myself
and I'm so focused and every like that I
don't feel like the time is right
any time soon um obviously not could
mean totally get our own house and get
married and all that kind of stuff like
I mean marriage isn't I don't feel like
married has two couple kids but that's
pretty something that I would like to do
is get married first and then children
afterwards
do you like traditional names or unique
names I like both I like both my sister
is actually having a baby in June and
I'm so excited I'm gonna be an auntie
like she can't wait I'm just gonna spoil
the baby so much like I've already
bought it stuff and like on the white
company like I'm just obsessed she
doesn't know what the gender issue
doesn't want to like find out until the
day but I'm just like so excited to be a
Narnia coming my sister's like oh my god
you're gonna be like the crazy John Arne
at the porch no I mean stop me Lydia
said how long we'd are super warm what
kind
dance with your favorite also why don't
you show any of his awesome because I
think it'd be bomb ah
thank you and see I went to college for
almost two years I had to drop out
because it was expensive and I couldn't
afford it any longer I couldn't afford
to finish my trainer before that I was
dancing before just say yes seven eight
years before that seven eight years and
then I went professionals College and
also another reason why I dropped out is
because it got quiet like musical
theatrical and I read just didn't want
to do anything super musicals they are
I'm not someone that's like do you know
I mean like musical fit I just left my
thing like I mean when we had to do we
had a guy from Mamma Mia come and teach
us some routines cuz he was in the West
and he would come and teach us some
routines more on me and I hated it
alright literally all that like I love
going to watch it don't get me wrong I
love going to the beer and watching it
but I'm not that person I can't act or
anything like and when these two make me
do like I can get to do acting classes
and surprised hey it like I used to try
to have a day of sick every time there
was an acting class cuz I hated it I was
so bad act in my teachings to be like
the only thing always sees dance and
sing that's what I wanted to do I didn't
want to do like I wanted to do like hip
hop R&amp;amp;B like that kind of thing like
singing I had a thing is you to go Shawn
Williams and he was sick like he was
 sick and I used to do like such
good songs not like musical theater like
if I had to do musical theater I memory
stuff singing lessons from musical
theater because you just have to do like
you have to do what he has to do
everything when you're at that college
and then I have a musical theater
teacher used to say that like I had
really like wanting to sing it it was
sound like because I've been like
singing R&amp;amp;B since I was like a kid it
sounded like really I don't know what
the word she sees but she used to get
really annoyed to me because my
pronunciation wasn't right and all that
kind of but yeah musical theater no
work for me that was not a reason why I
dropped out kind of watch you got the
whole music video anything like x-factor
backing down
sir or okay famous person's back a
dancer one of my friends is unlike
William V Festival not kind of stuff and
he's made him but yeah that's the kind
of thing I want to do I don't want to do
the whole musical say I think which they
always try and push you down I don't
know why I try and push you down that
route but they do and yeah that was
another reason yeah I just kind of I
don't really dance anymore like I used
to go pineapple and stuff and I used to
go to classes all the time by just stone
and I'm the time anymore like if I had
this bedtime i 100% would get back into
it
Christine Lauren said your favorite
three looks you've ever created I don't
know I'm really hard on myself like I
think something it's good and I look
back in a week like and I'm like do I
delete it delete it do I keep it do I
delete it do I keep it I always do that
but you know you look at sexy March I
could go from Instagram now and I think
I could delete so many of those pictures
but I just it's memories and it's
practice and you can see like oh you
know I've got better and stuff but I
don't know actually
I think one of my favorites is the one
that's pinned on my Twitter I pinned it
because I loved it like it's one of my
faves and it's like a triple cut Cruz
and that took me so long and I was in
such a creative Munoz at Todd's house
and I was like toddler I need to go buy
some makeup cuz I didn't bring much mega
trees house it's like I need to go buy
some makeup because I really feel great
everyone I want to create like a makeup
look and Stephanie is that cool let's go
went to boots and I went to Nick Simon
Rowan Nicks and I picked up so much
makeup so just he was watching the
football and I was just sitting there
playing makeup and I came up with that
and I was like you know and like you
feel like you just feel like creative
you just want to like you just want to
create something and I always think
that's when the best looks come out so
Megan said if you could launch any of
you product of your own right now what
would it be and why and eyelashes
eyelashes and lip gloss because I love
lip gloss at the minute as you guys know
I live in lip
I don't know why I ever didn't wear lip
gloss before like is that my new thing
whenever I'm at lips I'm like I feel
like something's missing like I feel
weird when I wear my lips glosses like
money thing I'm living in it so yeah
eyelashes and lip gloss because I love
eyelashes false lashes I love what's
your updated Tama routine Libby veins so
when I'm feeling like YouTube videos are
stuff I attend so just put on so like
all the way down here and then someone
my arms and stuff because I can't be
asked to fake town honestly and then you
guys are just like hard what did you get
hits I'm like runs up no seriously like
I just faked her knees such high
maintenance and like I'm tired as
under here okay and I've put bronzer
done when I can whatever but I am painis
part because I cannot be bothered with
fake tan
I just can't guys with the whole process
of like it was thrown I'm scaly and
you've got to scrub it off and start
again and no no last summer I was so
tanned or like some are off until about
a stair kept my cell for a long time up
until just before December I was still
turn because I went on so many more days
last year but even when I'm on holiday I
still he's like some creams and stuff
but I still do get a little bit of a tan
and a bit of a color which is nice and
then all my pictures I just up with
saturation hey you guys what I was
really tired
no but seriously sometimes my pictures
if I think oh I could look a bit more
turned you know I mean up the contrast
up the saturation boom like a fake tan I
did but if you do want a good fake town
love in town I live for it ultra dark
life in town it's one of my absolute
favorites I don't even get it in the UK
yet it's in Australia and it's a
nightmare and luckily they do send it me
and I'm very very grateful for that but
next time they send me some I'm gonna do
give one I'm gonna put some tan in there
because it's so bomb I'm gonna do a
giveaway anyway but I'm like collecting
I want to do a huge one so I'm gonna
like collecting things and then I want
to go buy stuff for myself and buy like
two of it so I can put one in the
giveaway and I'm just got like a whole
plastic box and I'm just gonna fill the
whole thing
I want to do a big one um I might just
do it when I hit 500k I might do it then
yeah cuz that's half a million
subscribers what
okay so Jennifer a pro said how long
does it take for your YouTube to pick up
what would your advice be for anyone's
at a YouTube channel
um I feel like it did quite well at this
start like it did grow really fast I
think it's because I already had some
followers on Instagram I'm really pretty
kind of transferred over to YouTube
stuff and but I would say if you're
starting out is maybe just try to focus
on all platforms like people always like
I like that of Twitter I know that's
where but Twitter is good I feel like
Twitter is such a good way to connect
with people like you guys tweet them as
Homer I love it like I go to Twitter so
I can reply to you because I thought out
with Vince around the ends and all that
fun stuff like you don't get
notifications for it and also they all
get lost and I just can't I just can't
physically answer them all but with
Twitter with notifications like I rarely
miss some if I miss some that employed
just busy but I'm always on to it I just
I answer questions and I'm talking to
you guys and I just love it so I think
focus on your Twitter your Instagram and
your youtubers try and grow everything
sis and I don't just focus on one thing
try and do them all which it's hard I'm
not gonna lie it's a lot of work it's
it's so hard for me to give advice
because now I feel like when I first
died which was two years ago two years
ago I think it was two years ago maybe
just over two years ago and it wasn't
nowhere near as like many people doing
it as there is now now I feel like it's
just so crazy how many people are doing
and there's so many talented makeup
people out there but I just think just
show your personality in just be you and
just work hard and just yeah try your
best to just push it and push it a
vision much as possible like be a just
consumer a lot of your time and don't
get disheartened David Christie said
what's your favorite perfume psi Paulo
I've had half a bottle of wine and I
love you
keeping it Rhode Island oh I love that I
love you too
and yes bottle of wine I haven't had
white in so long what is going on I'm
trying to eat healthy and I'm like oh
 and I just felt like this time when
you calories in one I'm just trying to
like swerve that for a little while you
know I mean and what I get wine drama
and I get very emotional I mean it's not
about laughing about the only thing like
if I get wine drunk I could get very
emotional and start crying and I start
like being all right in my feelings and
 but like if I drink vodka and that
I'm not you know I mean so I was
thinking to like vodka and cokes and so
when we go out now because wine drunk
ain't a good drum for me if you can
relate you can relate but you know I
mean wish your favorite perfume my
favorite perfume is Jimmy Choo Alissa I
love it I wear all the time
I've gone through about three bottles of
it I do want to change up and try
something new but you know you just feel
like the shoe or said you not I mean
but that's my bitch I mean like I don't
know I do want to try something neither
um so Sophie said Sophie Bowman said
when you get my rage would you trust
someone else do your makeup or would you
want it to be yourself so you know it's
gonna be unreal oh thank you but you
know what I think would be quite nice
because obviously it's your wedding day
is wasted for a little bit relax not too
stressed and I would quite like someone
to do my makeup but I'd like someone
like I think I'd like I love Celera here
thinking so you say name Karen I'd love
her to do my makeup oh my god I'm like
I've got someone that has a similar
style to me I would love to do my makeup
tomorrow I did a um just because I
wouldn't I'd rather sit and drink
Prosecco you know what I mean so Josh
would end he's one of my friends and he
just started his YouTube channel so make
sure you go check it out love him to
death he's so funny and he said what's
the biggest highlight and low-light of
your career and who was your first
celebrity crush
wow that's really hard I feel like just
this whole the whole thing has been a
highlight like the whole thing of like
being able to like quit my job and just
do YouTube like that way that was a
highlight the day I handed him my notice
and my job and I could
I quit my job and do this full-time and
something that I'm truly passionate
about that was probably the best thing
ever
the best thing ever the best day ever I
think I got really drunk that day it was
the best day ever
I say low-light is maybe like sometimes
the pressure to always put out right
good quality content because I'm so hard
on myself sometimes and I'll film a
video and I'll be like no no I can do
better than that no and and I think
lately what I've really enjoyed is doing
these testing videos and trying products
and more enjoyable kind of videos and
challenge videos I've really enjoyed
doing that because I think because I was
doing tutorials I've done tutorial is
for so bright this whole two years and I
when it comes down to my teacher as if
there was a tiny little I shouldn't that
was not blended or could have been
blended better or whatever I would
literally take the whole thing off
delete the whole video which would have
been an hour and a half long and start
again son was always actually filmed the
whole tutorial and then I would go to
edit it on my laptop like two three
hours then I go get food then I pick a
home with a sitting or an edit going to
sitting on an edit and blight oh my god
I don't like it because there's one or
thing I don't like all is this that I
don't like or there's a bit of eye
shadow fool doubt on my lashes like it
was getting ridiculous and literally I
was putting so much pressure on myself
and now I just think I'm having more fun
with YouTube like I'm just having so
much more fun like I thought you guys
can get to know me a bit better and if
you want to see tutorials I'm Sona do
tutorials but just not just all
tutorials and I'm gonna put more
tutorials on my Instagram so if you
don't follow minutes from hopes then I'm
gonna put a little mini instagrams
Torrio's on there and then just have
more fun in ways you can oh I've just
really been enjoying switching off and
doing something a little bit different
and so Kelly said worst thing and best
thing about being a youtuber so who are
your top five beauty gurus love you love
you tea and worse the best thing worst
thing is the editing for me just purely
because I'm not very good when it comes
to that sort of thing I don't really
understand it's like I always used to
stay up all night
I use Final Cut Pro and I could only do
the basics and I don't know I just need
to go on a training course or something
my attention span is really bad I like
if I go on a course for like how to edit
and stuff because we're not talking
about makeup I'll just be like but you
know I mean like I think not it's not
the worst thing but it takes me so long
to edit a video it takes me I mean
sometimes I can film video and get it up
in that day and I see if I'm like right
as soon as I finish I'm just gonna put
the thing on the boot I like trying to
end it
the best thing about being a youtuber is
just everything about love it so much I
love you guys I love maker I know that I
can kind of set my own schedule
and I will say when you work from home
and you kind of work for yourself in a
way that comes technically self-employed
it's you know I mean I might just blow
off some quick now quick that you know
have a quick cheeky now when I was
visiting us on member of yeah especially
because my workspace is in my bedroom so
like I have my bedroom my workspace
everything is in this room and I just
sometimes I'm a little shaky know what I
should be doing something so Rebecca
rise a question please answer would you
use to any of your Instagram pictures if
you do that is any tips you catch
obvious love you are so funny thank you
I love you tea and I use face chin I
mean we all use face to a little bit
detail a bit smooth I mean anyone says
don't use face tune is telling lies we
all use a bit of face tune okay I don't
go crazy of it I just do a little bit
here or like if I get like a little
crease here cuz I'm gonna take pictures
of my makeup like the end of the day I'm
whatever bit of creasing I little bit
oily so I just move it so it looks nice
and not shiny and then I have a visco
which is God I don't know how to I have
thirty two thousand five hundred and
thirty three unread emails and I know
for some people that might trigger you
so obvious I was going to show you
I was gonna show you my app and the foot
never mind is tricky
do you know I mean some people will get
real funny about it up my friends I'm
more friends alight you've got thirty
thousand five very much that makes me
feel sick I'm right on red basically
just that spam in it anyway
and so I use vsco vsco and it has the
best filters on there ever I use e8s one
of my faves 85 one of my favorites
especially if you take a picture in like
water or like an app alright in a
swimsuit and you for the suck a little
bit blue if you use the a5 fill are it
makes the blue in the blue of the water
look insane and but yeah play around
with that that is one of the best apps
for filters and I use that all the time
I don't really use Instagram doors I use
that and then on Instagram I won't even
like up the contrast up the brightness
when we turn the lights down do a little
bit of saturation sharpen I like to shop
my photos I like them to be quite sharp
because where I like to do a little bit
smooth on Phase two and I then want it
to look really nice till what you don't
see my skin I don't want it like do you
know I mean so yeah visco visco app is
bomb so if you said we'd be reviewing
the new makeup revolution foundation
stick and I can if you want but I just
feel like a review so a foundation
sticks I didn't want you guys to be like
for sake not on a foundation stick
you not I mean because I did the
hourglass best iconic London then I did
the L'Oreal furnishes a service or do we
need another foundation stick really but
if you want me to test it out then you
know I will okay and so Martine said how
long did you restarted to wear makeup or
when you started to like makeup um I
feel like I used to wear makeup well I
used to like have my little scented lip
