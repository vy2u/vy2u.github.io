do a sit-down video and just talk
because I've never done this I feel like
you guys don't know me that well and
loads of you ask me certain questions on
like how I managed to get to this point
in my life web don't care what anyone
thinks about me how did I gain
confidence and like just things like
that and I just think it's quite
important for me to kind of share my
journey with you and let you guys know
how I got to this point in my life
so when I was 16 17 18 19 for four years
I was a people pleaser I really wanted
everyone to like me I used to get upset
if people didn't like me I'd do
everything I've had to get everybody to
like me and by doing that I wasn't happy
in myself I didn't feel happy because I
was constantly trying to please
everybody else apart from myself um and
even then people didn't like me because
not everybody is gonna like you and that
is just literally life and I just went
through those four years really caring
what people thought about me as well I
started Instagram I started posting
looks on Instagram of things and I was
getting nasty comments like you dude is
out there are trials on the internet and
I they really affects me I let it get me
down I got upset about it and it made me
quite insecure I started worrying about
oh my god do I look like that or oh my
god is that like is that true what they
saying like is that how I look to other
people
I've really panicked and I really
thought oh my god that is I need to
change that on each of this need to do
that and then I'm not even joking when I
say one day one day I just sat there and
I thought I can't live like this I need
to change my mindset because I cannot
live my life trying to please everybody
else and giving a what people think
I can't it's so unhealthy for one and
two it was just making me really upset
they don't give a they're saying
the nasty comment because they're behind
a computer I was the one that was being
really affected by it and I was like
what am I going to let someone do that
to me I don't even know these people I
think could walk past me in the street
and I would have a clue who they are so
why do I give a about their opinion
why do I actually care and I basically
sat down one day and for I can't live
like this anymore I've got to change my
mindset
start is realizing that it's okay for
everybody not to like you because that's
life not everybody is gonna like you
that's just that is how it is there's
people that I genuinely don't like not
because I've done anything to me but
just because they're not my type of
people and that's just normal that's
life it not everybody likes everyone not
everybody gets on and it's okay do you
know I mean and I think as soon as I
started to realize that I then started
not to give a it was just one of
them things I just I just literally woke
up one day before I can't live like this
is so unhealthy I need to change my
mindset and as well I've just started
being more of a positive person I don't
know if any of you guys have ever heard
about the law of attraction or anything
like that but I genuinely love it it
really really helped me if you guys
don't know what it is I'll link it below
um there's a book out on the seeker and
it's basically once you interpret this
into your life I feel like it will
actually change your life yeah so
basically if you think positive positive
things are going to happen to you if you
dwell on the negative if you sit there
and you dwell about with these negative
comments you let it go through your head
your clutter you thinking negative
things then negative things are going to
happen to you and I honestly live by it
now I swear by it I is so true because
that whole four years I was be I was
such a negative person because I was
constantly trying to please people I had
the worst luck ever I like my life
things that used to happen to me my luck
was so bad they call it luck but I think
it's just an T or obviously your mindset
but loads of things started happening to
me that we're just really negative and
bad and went for a really bad stage and
now it's like now I'm such a positive
person I always think positive and I
don't dwell on negative things I don't
let negative things affect me I've
achieved so much and I'm really proud of
myself like I've had clothing
collections with one of my favorite
brands my varnish dress
I've been sponsored by brands so I never
dreamed I'd be sponsored by and it's
just crazy if you honestly interpret
into your life and start thinking
positive and being more of a positive
person good things will happen to you
and you can achieve anything you want in
your life
don't let anyone
any different because I remember when I
left school my teachers used to say to
me you'll never you'll never get
anywhere in life like you'll never get
anywhere Obama blah I honestly started
to believe that I did when I left school
I believe that because my GCSE results
were bad I didn't really know where I
want you to go in my life I knew I
wanted to be a professional dancer at
this point but it was having the money
to be able to do the training but the
amount of teachers that you say to me
you're never going to get anywhere in
life right because I started to believe
it I wasn't getting anywhere in my life
I trained professional dance for two
years and had to quit because I couldn't
afford to go anymore
I had a trust fund that was set up for
me as a child I used all of that money
to do my training and I just I couldn't
afford it anymore so unfortunately I had
to drop out so that was one thing that
because I was so negative and I was
thinking so bad not all these things
like I kept thinking I'm going to fail
the teachers tell me it's going when I
fail so I'm never going to be anything
in my life and that happened and then I
was skipping from job to job to job and
I had loads of dead-end jobs because I
couldn't get a good job I like she went
to Burger King I worked at our boss I
then moved to like to like party stuff
for like kids and stuff I then moved to
an office I did coke all over a little
while I did if I'd been work did so many
jobs because I honestly thought I would
never get anywhere my life and I was
like no I am better than this I can thin
something in there is something out
there that I should be doing like I'm
gonna find my purpose as people call it
I was like there's something that I
should be doing and this is not here
this is not me this is not for me I'm
gonna find what I should be doing and
it's crazy because since I started
thinking positive and stuff I then
became so obsessed with makeup I became
so interested in it it was crazy like I
was like whoa like this is crazy like
I'm obsessed I was so in select art like
performing arts normal art just
everything I even at school I was so
artistic as a child I used to draw and
stuff like that so I've always been
quite art in and I just literally became
obsessed of it I started reading
books on how to do certain techniques at
this point I wasn't aware of YouTube but
I knew what YouTube was but I never
really used to use it I was really like
oh like I didn't even know what it was
like two three years ago I didn't know
what it was but I didn't never used to
use it so I didn't know them as things
such as like makeup tutorials or
anything and then I got the Bobby Brown
makeup minor I remember and I was
obsessed of it I was I
this book is holy why or like it taught
me so much and then went to Mac I was
buying foundations brushes everything I
was buying and if it's not needed I was
practicing all the time
I like she used to spend days to work
Monday to Friday night and then I just
spend my weekends like doing my makeup
like even in the evenings when I got
home from work I black right I want to
do my makeup going to sit down and do my
makeup and just try new things and just
practice and practice and practice and I
just became obsessed of it and I was
like this is what I should be doing
makeup is what I should be doing yeah so
I did I just taught myself taught myself
everything that I know I then became
across makeup tutorials and became
obsessed I remember I was obsessed with
Lauren Curtis and when I first up
watching them everything she sees I
would go and buy like I remember one
time I watch one of our tutorials and it
was like Christmas coming up and my mom
was like would you love Christmas and I
was like oh my god like makeup so I
actually went on Lauren Curtis this
video and I just wrote down everything
that she'd use in this video I was like
mom I want this she was like for God's
sake and he just went from there and
then I started posting my work on
Instagram and using hashtags for brands
and stuff to try and get noticed and I
became completely obsessive amrezy um
where I became completely obsessed with
Carli bybel and I was just like this is
definitely why should we do him and then
I became obsessed with kyta Bible huge
YouTube channel and I was like you know
what I would love to do that I would
love to just sit there and film makeup
tutorials I just love to do it so I
remember I thought is my first video
I've still got on my channel since Miss
Vilar
and like my favorite products or
whatever but um it just is crazy
really it's crazy to me and for me so
now I have this as my career at my
full-time job
um YouTube and Instagram and just the
whole makeup ensuring itself
beauty blog in it's crazy to me because
I never saw it coming
it's crazy I just feel like I found my
purpose if that makes sense I I feel
like this is 100% why should be do man
and it's amazing it's such an amazing
feelings I feel like a few years ago I
was broke I was working the shittiest
jobs you can think of when I was how old
was I 16 when I got my first job I was
on free pass 62 an hour wha
I just have to ask my mom for money all
the time
I know it's crazy I thought I I never
thought this could happen I'm so excited
for the future because I can see myself
but I have mine well I've got things in
my head that I want to do and I know
it's gonna happen so I'm gonna have my
makeup collection and things like that
so we'll see what happens but it's crazy
I honestly I just want this to kind of
inspire you guys and just let you guys
know that you can do anything that you
want to do I promise you I love school
of no GCSEs and I have them the best
career of I'm obsessed I feel like in
regards to success some people see
successes I have loads of money or
whatever whatever but for me for I
classes being successful is having
something like absolutely love and I'm
obsessed with as my job because you have
to work every single day of your life
obviously and then you die as deep as it
sounds you work every single day of your
life to die I want to be doing something
that I absolutely love and I feel like I
found that I'm completely obsessed and I
feel like I am successful because I am
the happiest person I could be right now
and my job is my absolute passion and I
never dreaded out of work and that is
that was my goal from day one was to
love what I do and I love what I did so
