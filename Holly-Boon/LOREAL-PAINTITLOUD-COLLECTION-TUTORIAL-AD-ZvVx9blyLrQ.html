L'Oreal to create this makeup look using
their new paint new cloud range and this
is basically their campaign about paint
your face and push yourself at your
concert zone when it comes to color
there's a lot of colorful products in
this selection and there's a lot to
experiment with which is so much fun
because you know I'm like I love to
experiment with color so I thought I
would just come up with this kind of
like soft pink and powerful makeup looks
it's kind of coming to spring/summer and
I thought this would be ideal
so this is what I came up with but it is
really cool they've got lasers I crayons
we've got cream blush they've got a
blush palette and they've got these lip
paints which are really really cool I
think they've got a page as well which
is really fun
they're like creamy eye shadow is
celebrity cool as well so yeah I am
going to show you how I created this
makeup look they also have a competition
going on if you guys will win all of
this paint loud collection that'll be in
the description box below on how to n
art and all the other jazz so yeah if
you want to pry it out highlight this
makeup look then please keep watching
so already doing over I of cameras and
I'm going to run Si and I'm using a
mixture of the infallible L'Oreal brush
paint I mean these brushes eyeshadow and
it went really well as I said it and I
rewrite them so there's well it's called
Amber's and one that's called Pink's and
I'm just actually using a mixture of two
so I'll show you which one's the reason
anyway so from the pink palette I'm
going to take this light shown here the
light shade in the palette and I'm going
to apply that I'm using my Sigma
airbrush blender
then from that same pink blush palette
I'm going to take this bright pink shade
right here I'm going to apply that in
the crease I'm using my Sigma blending
e36 brush next this is from the amber
palette which is more peachy tones I'm
going to go in with this shade right
here which is the 3s
pinky peachy color it's called Amber
love and I'm going to just go into that
use bit this in the crease I can't
believe I've actually got short nails
guys can you believe it I've gone for
short nails this doesn't have a stand a
half a bottle over then a point of long
nails again one extra step but wise my
lid I'm going to take this shade right
here which is called Indian Cruise I'm
going to apply that with my Sigma e 50
so I'm then going to go in with this
which is the iPad is in shade 101 I'm
just going to apply a little bit of this
into the center of my lid and then I'm
going to blend it out
so I just applied to Russia's off camera
these are the legal each lashes and
opulence I've just put two pairs on each
eye just to make it a little bit more
dramatic so without my face I am going
so first we'll use the l'oreal
infallible mattifying base in the sense
of my face this is really really good
fit silicone base for minimizing your
pores so I'm just going to apply it
right in center here and also it's
mattifying so it's really getting my
t-zone look at pause be gone then the
rest of my face I'm gonna take my lms
biotech skin energizing day cream I love
it it's like a serum and a moisturizer
mixed in one then for eye cream I'm
going to take the ginseng refreshing eye
cream is too bright and indeed puff it's
got this like a little bit pinky so it
helps to minimize your dark circles look
of them please excuse my hair I just
sort of tied up in a one word in my
face I clean all we do this anyway I
would have do my makeup I would just tie
my hair up crazy to like it out the way
well there's even makeup and then it's
going to spray a little bit of the Mac 6
fat as well really hydrated your base
will just look so much better off me
so I swipe our nation I'm going to take
the l'oreal infallible total carb are
mixed with my True Match this is my
favorite foundation combination and I
actually think I like it more than the
hourglass
I never thought I'd say that I'll be
using it all the time it just doesn't
break me out it looks pretty good so
yeah material cover ru shade amber which
is way too dark for me but these two
shades mix together work very well so I
just like to dot a little bit of this
around with first of all then I'm going
to take some of my L'Oreal True Match
I lost the lids so I don't actually know
what shade this is and doesn't have it
written on it anywhere else which is
kind of annoying I feel like it should
say on the bottom or something I don't
know what shade this is but I'll find it
and link it below anyway so I'm going to
take this a couple of squirts on my hand
then I'm going to take my Sigma 3d
bender and then just I'll end it all day
got that full coverage full coverage
satin finish is what a low say for
concealer I'm going to take my tart
shape tape and shade light to medium
this is a really good for full coverage
concealer so I'm just going to set right
on dry and of course and retake my Laura
Mercier translucent powder
I do not be asking my no kind of powered
up but I just hate the container so and
we went into weather over CA one runs
out and then I'm going to use that
container and just put my RC ma one in
there so yeah risk setting my under eye
well just ended when I apply concealer
so I'm going to finish off my eyes like
we're gonna finish up this foundation by
the way and I keep going away but I
really love it I just can't get over it
um okay should go to my hotel my
snapchat and my last video but I mean it
is so nice so going away with that
bright pink shade from the pink palette
first of all so this shows right here
converse using this on my Sigma H a six
brush
then from the Loreal painted our
collection I'm going to take the
infallible gel crayon in this nice
purple shade number eleven it's called
violet and then when I apply this in my
waterline and then I'm going to bring it
down slightly as well okay so for
mascara I'll miss it when oreo
telescopic and risk it up closer to my
lower lashes okay so it's going to
bronze up a tiny bit so I'm going to
take my Chanel slowly tan - under the
cream bronze up I was going to apply for
the Ness then we go straight in with
some contour and I'm going to use my
other stars yeah every hair is contour
kit and shade like to medium and take
this darker shade here
so maybe to try this l'oreal infallible
blush pain I'm not actually tried this
one yet
I've tried everything else but this
silent right so I don't see how that's
going
they only use cream blush because I
don't know how to understand that how do
you even apply this okay it's like this
and how about this says Dave I think I'm
just going to put a tiny spell so I
might hit this brush from view bail and
just run my brush over the top see I'm
just running my brush over let you like
that first works good actually the cream
looks really nice on the skin so I only
go to this peachy shade right here which
is called and below and again I'm going
to take on this little tiny sniffles
type brush from view bow and slide it up
so somehow hi I'm going to use a
nostalgic over heels and Nicole Guerrero
palette because I loved it is that you
my favorite than women so many you
should go get our wishes that shade like
that and my Sigma I'm highlighter brush
is the fo3 brush I'm going to spray my
face first of all this is sixth class
okay so for my nets and winter is glory

Hollywood stage so that is the finished
look I hope you guys enjoyed this
