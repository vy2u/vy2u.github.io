tutorial on how to get nearly glutes you
big glamorous curly hair so yeah a lot
of you asked me for more of a more hair
tutorials rather than just makeup
tutorials so yeah we're gonna see how
this goes
this is my natural hair length I'm gonna
use the Lilly ghalichi 260 grams hair
extensions by Bellamy and then I've also
got this and curling Tommy from Bellamy
and that I'm going to use as well
so yeah let's see how this goes so to
start with I'm taking a weft with four
clips on and I'm going to clip this
right at the bottom and just then you
can't see where my natural hair ends and
then I'm going to section my hair off
own quite low and I'm going to add
another weft with four clips as well
so now taking my curling Tong I'm just
going to take a section of hair wrap it
around the curling Tong I'm going to
leave it for about 10 to 15 seconds and
then I'm going to let it drop
once the flutter drop and then gonna
wrap it around my fingers and I'm going
to clip it into a pin curl I will put a
link in the description box below where
you can get these hair extensions and
the curling Tong and also I will link my
Twitter and Instagram because a lot of
you guys have asked if I have it and yes
I do
and I do post a lot of makeup and outfit
pictures so if you want to check me out
on there I will link that down below for
you so once that's all curled and pinned
up and then going to section my hair off
again and this time I've used two of the
three clip weft
so again just sectioning my hair on the
left side I'm using a two clip weft and
on the right side I'm using a three clip
weft just because the right side of my
hair is thicker and I'm gonna wear my
hair is one side
drop
say no I'm just curling the top of my
hair my natural hair once that's all
curled and pinned up I'm then gonna
hairspray it and leave it for about half
an hour
so the hairspray I'm using is called
silhouette I really like this hairspray
sometimes it does go a bit too hard
though which I'm not a massive fan of
but I do pretty much use this all the
time so now I'm going to start taking
them out I'm gonna work from the bottom
because the bottom ones have been in
longer than the top ones if I'm going on
a night out I normally leave this for
about an hour before I start taking it
out and but in this case I have left it
for about half an hour
so now I'm just taking a paddle brush
and I'm just going to brush the curls
out because I don't like them to be
really tight and I want it to be more of
a wave rather than a curl and lastly I'm
just gonna hairspray that all in place I
hope you guys enjoyed this video and I
will see you again next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
