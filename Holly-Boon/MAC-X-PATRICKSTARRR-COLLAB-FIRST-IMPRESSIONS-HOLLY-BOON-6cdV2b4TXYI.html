channel hello everyone if you're new
here my name is Holly Boone and so Holly
brain holy braid I hate my son I'm not
gonna lie Ben is just annoying
anyway so today I'm gonna be down look
using the Patrick style map collection
which I'm so excited about I honestly as
soon as it's not wrong the first day I
was on that website and I was ordering
it it's like I couldn't wait so I did
pretty much get all of the collection
the only thing I didn't get was both of
the eyeshadow quads I just got the one
that I would use the most and then also
with the lips and the lip stuff I didn't
get the lightest color I'm not sure what
that's called but I didn't get that one
I just got mom a start and a Patrick
word because the lighter color probably
wouldn't look that great on me so yeah
I'm so excited I'm mostly excited about
this powered up because we all know the
Patrick
it's just unreal when it comes to
father's so so I've done my foundation
my brows and I have done my eyeshadow
base of camera I am now gonna do my
concealer and then I'm gonna fake and
then whilst I bake them with you my eye
makeup I'm sorry I don't you can't wait
so for my concealer I'm gonna use the
Mabry in the eraser eye concealer in the
shade nude which I'm literally almost
out of it's nearly run out I'm gonna
apply this with my Mac 195 brush this
did have a little sponge on the end but
it started to get a bit messy so I
pulled the sponge off no I just use a
brush if you did get more coverage when
you use this Ponder's oh yeah like I do
I really love this concealer I just the
sponge just makes it messy like I don't
know I know that's just me the finds it
really messy I can use it for a little
bit with the sponge and after a while
just like it okay so I'm gonna apply
some of this on my forehead I'm gonna
press them down the bridge of my nose as
well so I'm gonna blend this out with my
Beauty Blender I love the Beauty Blender
came out with this teal color but it
just just looks so messy now have used
it huh that's the finger beauty blenders
I love the colors that they come in but
they just look so messy after you've
used them like once
and I've forgotten about how much I
cleaners this things just don't
completely come out I honestly cannot
think of anyone that deserves this more
like I love Patrick so like I've watched
him since forever since I started
watching YouTube videos basically and I
just love him I don't know how people
could just not like it why he's just so
funny
he's just so talented and he's so
hard-working he's just amazing I love I
lucci love him okay so now let's print
it in I'm gonna use my powder and the
packaging by the way is just so nice
it's literally gorgeous and his
signature is so nice my signature looks
like a hot mess like my signature looks
like someone two-year-olds just covered
out of a paper I like you she sick so
neat okay so this is the powder the
packaging again is so nice this was
pretty smooth which I like so this
powder does have a peachy on the time
but it's really gonna brighten up the
under-eye so I'm excited so it's just
like your standard powder it has the
little holes you pull the bit off and it
comes out so I'm gonna pull some of this
in the lid so I'm gonna take a separate
sponge I always use one for power dog
one for cream this one is a little bit
damp as well so I'm just gonna take this
powder
okay so once you actually apply it to
the skin it doesn't actually look very
peachy so that's good
the powder feels nice and like the light
way and it feels like fine it doesn't
feel heavy at all which is nice like
some powder you get and they're just so
heavy so I'm going to leave my under-eye
to bake whilst I do my eye makeup I've
just see what you in for the eye shadow
part so I've got the eye shadow the for
eye shadows which has the gold shimmer
and the burgundy shade so we have
Patrick Starr signature on here in the
silver which is so nice so I'm gonna
first of all take the shade swiss
chocolate which is this shade right here
on my Mac two to four brush which is a
fluffy brush and we're gonna use this
shade for my transition color so I'm
just going to really lightly just above
my crease so these shades do already
exist at Mac but these are Patrick's
favorite colors that he put into two
palette like these four shades are
definitely my kind of go to so so I'm
just going really softly just backwards
and forwards and then kind of like
circular motions
Patrick story is where I was just so
inspiring and I can worked at Mac and
then you know he was told like to take
his make laugh and he can wear that
makeup and stuff and you know he's gone
from working at Mac so you having a
collection with Mac is just insane it's
just so crazy and just really inspiring
so I'm then gonna use my morphe brush
this isn't happen on box it came in a
set which is kind of annoying I'm going
to use this shade Swiss chocolate which
is this one right here
see I'm just working this right in the
crease and bringing it all the way into
the inner corner as well and then I'm
gonna take my fluffy brush with that
shade soft brown blend up the edge it's
just like so nice when you blend these
two shades together just like so soft
and just so nice what I rather just have
an absolute master day that one looks so
fresh for defined at the staff she's
such a good just like reddish brown and
then when you blend it with that soft
brown shade it just looks so nice so I
had a nightmare with this collection
because I did it last Thursday and I
went to get excited every time impatient
and I was like I want it ASAP and as
always check out I must have just click
started delivery by accident then I was
like oh I really wanted someone have fun
with it and then I was like okay I'm
have to go into town and see if I put it
in store but they don't have it in Mac
stores in the UK until January the woman
told me so I was like oh so I went
online just trying to order again and
for our next live right now could you
give away with the other set and then it
was sold out so I sold out quick so
great and we're gonna take a different
fluffy brush because I kind of like the
fact that this has kind of softened out
a little bit like I don't want it to be
too too much so I'm gonna take this
shade right here which is cool
I'm into it this one right here and I'm
gonna apply this to the outer corner of
the eye but again if you just big fluffy
brush white pack on the products as much
so it would just be a bit softer and
this is my Sigma e30 8 diffused crease
brush
so yeah I'm just gonna apply this to the
outer corner and I'm gonna bring it in
about half way then I'm gonna take that
morphe brush and that shade
Swiss chocolate I'm gonna go over that
the edge donut okay so I'm going to do
the same on the other side so just
lightly applying it to the outer corner
and bringing it into about half way so
the next thing I'm going to do is I'm
going to cut my crease so I'm going to
use my concealer I'm using the
Maybelline the eraser i I could just use
my face and I'm using my mac 242 brush
so yeah I'm just gonna cut my crease
with this I can't breathe when I do this
because I won't it up
hi little bit of powder on top of that
concealer because I don't want it to
transfer all over my eye
now I'm gonna blend the edge so go back
to the show Swiss chocolate I'm gonna
just go over the line so you just want
to kind of go backwards and forward over
that line just lightly oh okay so you
could use that boiled shadow from the
palette and it apply that on top of we
cut the crease but I kind of want to
keep it quite soft and just have it
matte or my morphe 25a palette I'm gonna
use this shade right here and I'm just
gonna apply that until that concealer so
this is just a flat lid brush from
morphe doesn't have a number I'm just
gonna press on top and we're just take a
black eyeshadow and I'm gonna line my
lashline just any black shadow it's fine
and the reason why I stick my ea-6b
liner brush
so when I passed him the SCARA okay so I
got these now she sent to me from
backstage lashes and these are in the
style date night so I think how to Rene
uses these I'm pretty sure she said that
she does so I don't Hannah Rene
and then trust opinions so I want to try
them those ones are just not as wispy as
I'd like so I'm gonna try ladies who
lunch these ones these are a bit more
frothy I'm using my house of lashes
eyelash glue okay so I'm gonna leave
those to dry for a second and I'm going
to finish off my eye makeup so I'm gonna
do my on drying I just wanted to take
the shade soft brown this one right here
and the PI's underneath the eyelid okay
I'm not gonna take this shade right here
then apply that closer to that lash line
and then I'm going to use the darkest
shade which is called I'm into you and
I'm gonna just keep this on the outer
corner I'm not gonna bring this away in
the powder looks really really good
I mean I didn't really expect anything
different from Patrick okay I said it
feels nice and lightweight like it
doesn't feel heavy on the skin it was
easy to dust it off I didn't get any
stop okay I'm gonna leave my eyelash
glue to dry at that because I need a way
I know too much information but I'm see
you burst in ok the lashes are on so I'm
gonna do a white in the waterline just
to open up the eyes a little bit
I'm gonna use my morphe coconut eyeliner
I'm gonna apply some mascara to my
bottom lashes
appearances the eyes I've done I'm just
gonna quickly finish up the rest of my
face and then we can do the lip so I'll
be back in a sec okay is that I am back
and I love the powder I love love the
powder it's got a peachy undertone when
you apply it it doesn't look peachy at
all and it really brightens up the under
eye and I love that it's really fine and
when you go to dust it often isn't stick
to the skin which is good and it doesn't
leave like a white cast or anything so
the powder is a yes yes yes yes yes for
me and the eyeshadow palette is so nice
and I just love the packaging on all of
this everything is so bomb so um yeah
I'm gonna do the lip colors next okay so
next I'm going to do the lip colors and
I'm gonna try them both on I've got the
lipsticks the lip liners and the glosses
I'm gonna try them all so you guys can
see what they look like so I'm first of
all gonna try mamas star which was the
first one I picked up which goes with
the lip liner mahogany so I'm going to
apply the mahogany lip liner first of
all
so I'm gonna take the lipstick in Amman
the star I think I'm so cute that he's
named it after his mom that's just
Sookie this is what the lipstick looks
Ike it's so pretty so far with this
Berkeley and Patrick's sparkly signature
and then Mac underneath so nice this is
the color
okay I love that what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna take a little bit of concealer
on my finger I'm gonna just top that in
the middle just to lighten up the center
of the lip okay so that is the lip liner
mahogany with Mama star lipstick and
then I did get the gloss as well but I
don't you try the gloss on separate or
put over the top I kind of want to put
it over the top because I always kind of
do that anyway so this is the gloss in
mama star again the packaging is
everything so I'm gonna try this on top
wow that's so nice
this is a really pigmented Gloster you
could just wear it on its own I always
wear which takes underneath glosses so I
think I just last longer as well when
you do that okay so that is the mahogany
lip pencil with the mama star lipstick
and then the mama star gloss as well
this is a lip gloss I love the lip
glosses from Mike doorways many many
balm and and it was really nice isn't it
feel really sticky which I like you
could just wear the gloss on its own I
will just watch me it's really pigmented
that's the gloss it's really pigmented
so you could just wear it on its own so
the other shade I picked up was Patrick
whoo I thought it was only right to get
Patrick way lipstick are you have wavy
way and I was like that's crazy that he
has a wound lipstick so I'm really
excited about it I did get the lip liner
and the gloss as well so investible to
line my lips with the brick lip pencil
okay so then we have Patrick Wu lipstick
again the faction is the same and this
is the shade love this I used to live in
Ruby woo like I've had it about two
years ago and I used to live in it like
all the time it makes sure it's he looks
so Wyatt okay so that took about ten
years means to get that knee and red
lips is so hard to get knee it's still
not understanding but anyway oh this is
so then I picked up the lip glass as
well in a Patrick Wu so I'm excited to
try this oh it's so good it's so nice
you know you've gotten used to feel like
you are that bitch right you are you can
take on the world you can do whatever
the you want to do yes we've lost
you right on definite you wear this on
Christmas Day
I definitely think of a better with less
eye makeup when I wear resarch just felt
a tiny little bit of brown in the crease
maybe a wing and then lashes but not too
much color going on my eyes so for now I
think I'm gonna go with the Mamas star
lip but I'm definitely nowhere to
Christmas I'm obsessed so that is the
finished look I just put them on the
star back on which I love it goes so
nice with this eye look and so I love
everything about the powder at the eye
shadow could I think it's a perfect four
shades and there I love the lip colors
I'm just obsessed everything and I just
say congratulations against Patrick
