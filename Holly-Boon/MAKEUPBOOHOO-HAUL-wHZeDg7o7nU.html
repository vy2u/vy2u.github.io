a whole video because the reason you
just bought some makeup and ordered some
clothes so I'm just basically gonna talk
you through what I got basically why I
bought it so yeah so I'm just gonna
start off with makeup and then I'm gonna
move on to clothes so the first thing
that I picked up was the row techniques
and powder brush now I've used rotating
expressions before and I was a huge fan
I don't really know why I stopped using
them and this brush was 25 pounds which
to be honest is quite expensive for a
powder brush you can get powder brushes
from like coz i Weaver or morphe for a
lot less but I just really like the
packaging I really like how it's gold so
speaking about what I picked up but yeah
so first of all I've got a power to
brush so the second thing I picked up
was the Naked 3 palette I've heard loads
of you talk about the naked palettes and
say how pigmented and how really nice
they are
and I've actually never used them before
I don't really know why I've just never
picked one up so I'm really excited to
use this one this one's got with the
really nice rose pink like basically
neutral colors in it so I'm really
excited to try this so yeah I'm gonna
bring in some lips with this and please
let me know any looks you want me to
create with this if you already have
this palette and you want to know like
how to do something then they said okay
sorry I'm just gonna quickly show you
guys and the colors in this palette if
you don't have the Naked palette we've
not heard of it before and so these are
the shades so you've got obviously
really nice just rosy pinky shades in a
couple of darker shades here and it also
comes with this brush which is really
cool as well and but yeah I just use
watch dudes in the shop I never really
pigmented I'm really really nice so I am
super excited to try this and I've just
dropped the brush on the floor great
okay so these next items from Elizabeth
Arden I got sent these in the mail and I
didn't actually purchase these with my
own money
but I'm I was sent this one two weeks
ago I think it was and it's good the
all-over miracle oil for face body and
hair and I've been using it on my skin
and the ends of my hair and I've been
it and ackerman but they've sent me the
cream before I wasn't a fan of that it's
just about really bad it just Regent
when you use it it's the eight hour
cream wasn't a fan of that one but this
I've been a huge fan of I am why Normie
do is cleanse and tone my skin and then
I'll just put this on over the top and
he just goes green eyes it gives my skin
a very nice healthy glow and it just
keeps my skin hydrated like I am quite
oily in my t-zone but recently I've been
a really dry under my eyes and on my
chin area and things like that because I
think it's just because the weather
change it's got what's been quite cold
here so I think it's probably that but
yeah this has been literally so good I'm
absolutely obsessed with this and this
product here I've got sent the grand
entrance mascara mic volume length and
lift and this is by Elizabeth Arden as
well I haven't actually tried this yet
I'm excited to try it because I have
been a huge fan of their products and so
yeah I don't know hug on with this and
the next thing they said be was the
eyebrow pencil now I got sent this from
them as well
probably about five months ago five or
six months ago now and I was obsessed of
it it was just so nice to make my
eyebrows look more natural and not so
dramatic because sometimes I do you like
more of a natural look so I used it and
I don't really know why I didn't
purchase it after I ran out I'm not
really sure but I was going to go makeup
shopping today so I messaged Elizabeth
Arden two days ago and said what was
that eyebrow prodigy Stephanie because I
really want to repurchase it and I've
got some got in free the barrel this
morning they actually said Mia which was
really nice of them but I'm going to do
tutorial using this eyebrow product
because it's basically like the
Anastasia brow Wiz it's the same sort of
product so then you get the spoon II and
it's the same twisting up eyebrow pencil
but I just forgot the formula is a lot
smoother and a lot easier to apply and
then when you blend out with the spoolie
it just blends out a lot better so yeah
I have been a huge fan of the
okay so the next thing I got was this
Laura Mercier
shimmer block i I'm the one it's like I
hit she just walked past the counter I
was actually not even gonna get any from
from Laura Mercier I was just walking
out John Lewis and I saw this I I saw
this on the side
something's kind of mini swatch that so
I switched on my hand and he is the most
gorgeous highlights huh everybody you
get four different shades I'll show ya
so you got four shades in this in this
so I literally this shade here let me to
show you look at this shades it's
literally gorgeous and I just watched it
and I was like no I have to buy it why
did I do this it was 32 pounds but I am
bitchy obsessed I'm so excited to try
this
almost I think this gold you color here
would be really nice because you could
use this on your eyes like if you wanted
like a shimmer shimmery gold on your
eyes you could use on your eyes um but I
think as a whole would be really nice
because I'm not really a massive fan of
brushes I find it hard to find brushes
that I like so I feel like if I'm going
for a really dewy glowy look I could
always just sort of rights well my brush
around and just use it as a blusher and
I think it would have really really nice
so yeah I'm gonna use that one in a
tutorial for you guys so you can see how
that goes okay so the next thing I
picked up was these glitter pigments
from Mac I love bit of pigment I love
working with it I just think it just
looks so pretty on the eye I just I'm
not a huge fan of just pure my eyes
anymore I used to just went mad
somewhere as and now I'm all into the
shimmers and the glitters so yeah so I
went into Mac didn't really like what I
wanted but there was a guy in there he
was really nice best to him and he
usually was just like selling me
everything in there like I was like oh I
don't know what that one and he sold me
this mascara what you talked about in a
minute but I might only might I wanted
some glitter and he showed me these and
these are literally gorgeous so this one
here is called
blue brown it's gorgeous it's brown and
it reflects blue
it's absolutely oh it's just so lush I'm
gonna show you guys this
just watch this on my hand see you can
I've done this really awkwardly why have
I done it there okay that was just
watching a different plays okay so this
I'm not very good at this watching
business I've just watched in the most
Awkward places but this is it it's like
a really gorgeous brown like it looks
Brown but it reflects this really nice
blue it's literally I felt it off of it
soon as you put it on my hand I was like
I'm definitely gonna get that so yeah
that's the first clear pigment that I
picked up so the next one I got this one
is called copper sparkle pretty much the
color that says copper sparkle and I'll
swatch this one for you as well so you
can see you I'm gonna mix you covered
and get up this is just um row
she might be easy just to straighten
this lit with it look at his color it's
just gorgeous it's I've really always
really warm it's just really nice I just
kind of wait to use this one as well so
yeah I did too when you get they've got
a very nice rose color like a row it's
like this but more pink and but they
didn't have in stock so this one this
one I got but it's just oh it's just
very nice I would just love working with
bits and stuff so I'm so excited she did
starting to look and the last thing that
I picked out rush you know she's got two
more things sorry I picked up first of
all I picked up the L'Oreal telescopic
because of Carli bybel I'm obsessed with
hair tutorials and I saw that she uses
this and I have been a fan of that
L'Oreal 4d la lash architects mascara
but I just wait to try starting to
friends say I picked this up and then
when I got to Mac the guy in there was
like have you ever tried this mascara
and I was just like oh no like I don't
know me tend to go for Mac mascaras or
expensive mascara just because I always
wear lashes so yeah anyway he removed my
bottom lash - makeup and he applied this
from lashes and I love it it's so good
it's literally unreal it's called the
extended
a some ink lash I don't wanna say that I
don't hate it and this brush is quite
good it really brush free the lashes so
yeah I got that
so I'll be using both from Dee's a
pretty switch up and just use them like
on and off and just see which one I like
better but yeah I'm going to be giving
these to a go okay so that's all the
makeup size so I'm not just gonna show
you what clothes I got so I will be
doing like a lookbook like try on type
of thing but I don't I don't really have
any space to film that so for now I'm
just going to just show you what I got
so I ordered yes I'm posing boohoo
and I molded them last night and they
they actually came this morning which is
crazy and but basically I've got this
top just white top and there's like the
jacket this is from there as well and I
also got I will link with this below in
case you want to purchase any of these
but I picked up this leather jacket this
it's just really nice I love leather
like biker jackets like I have like five
every jacket it's all like slight lead
your friend but I just really really
like them so yeah I picked up that was
35 pounds I do believe so the second
thing I picked up because I'm going up
on Saturday night so and I really wanted
like a high-neck dress so I picked up
this dress here so as you can see it's
just like a high-neck and it's got like
long sleeves like freak whatever sleeves
and then the bottom is just like a
curved 10 so it's just like curved at
the bottom I'm really not very good at
doing this but like no space I'm like
the wall there and I picked that up it's
like I've raised like off-white and that
was I think this was $15.99 so yeah
that's really good for a dress I will be
doing a look but guys how you'll be able
to see what is it like on but for now
I'm just gonna quickly show you
so yeah picked up this body suit as well
like I really like lace up front body
suits I'm a huge fan of them I've got
one in black and when I've got one in
like a really light nude but I just love
this camel color so yeah this is a body
see it's long sleeved and it's lace up
at the front and they
suppose how much was this oh it doesn't
say I think this was 15 pounds as well
or maybe less than that maybe 10 pound
I'm not sure and then the last thing
that I got was basically well it is the
exact same as the white one but I've got
one in black so again there's a
high-neck dress with like Freeport lamp
sleeves and then the bottom is just like
like curved hem that's curved at the
bottom um yeah I've got mine in black
