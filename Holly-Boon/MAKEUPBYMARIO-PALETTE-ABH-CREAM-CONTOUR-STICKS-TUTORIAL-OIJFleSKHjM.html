in my head hey everybody so I'm going to
do a look today using the makeup by
Mario palette if you don't need a is
that skimping on his makeup is he is
phenomenal he's collaborated with
Anastasia Beverly Hills and came back
from pallet and it is unbelievable that
we would have all guests anyway and so
I've already got my eyebrows I used the
dip brow pomade in chocolate as x and a
bash brown eyed actually changed because
if L like the ash brown makes my
eyebrows look more ash like too ashy but
you gray so I switched up interviews
chocolate I've been using dark brown
Joker ever nood up switching out
depending on my mood so anyway I am just
going to have carved up my eyebrows
slightly I'm just going to apply
concealer to my lid and I'm going to use
the Becca ultimate coverage concealer in
banana as always you guys know I
love this but I feel like I don't want
to use it only light user night you to
use soft ochre paint book by Mac but
that dries out my eyes I don't know if
anybody else has that problem and I mean
I've got not oily lids but mine is a
little bit oily so it really really
dries that mind then just don't like it
so don't get that if you've got dry eyes
if you've got to really I these that's
going to be perfect for us but yeah I'd
rather just use a concealer and then set
it anywhere except that with my Laura
Mercier translucent powder and my Sigma
bake precision precision brush next I
really can't talk I'm going to go for a
really soft and look on the eyes today
nothing too dramatic just because I'm
I'm just not feeling now I'm feeling
like just a really nice brown on the
eyes just to bring out my brown wise I
know when literally just smashes really
we can change me if you can't down okay
I'm gonna get started and shut the
up anyway so I'm gonna obviously use the
makeup by Miriam
i you guys because I'm on the a bhpr
list now which it's a dream come true
for me because they're my favorite brand
if you guys move me and then my favorite
brand out of every brand so to build
their P artist isn't it few dream come
true and I've got to send this palette
and I nearly died though it's so Bob
that is amazing film Singh this time
fear not for a time for time it's just
okay so first of all I'm going to take
this shade right here which is called
Isabel this shade right here I'm really
used to brush from the planet I'm just
going to apply this in my crease you
start you just above the crew
I had a day yourself do nothing because
I've been like I've had a mini coal and
let you know you just thought oh I need
to just literally do nothing for a whole
day and then I'll cover you get away for
doing that I was like oh and then going
to go in my mat 2 to 4 brush I am then
going to use this shade here which is
cool I do believe violator I'm not sure
that Isaiah Berlin I read it come and
say that show you about that I'm going
to apply this all over the lid there's
one of our subtle brands like yo you
know
I just said I was going to be subtle
wise and I mean this really is not
subtle with it story of my life I'm just
going to like a little bit of makeup
today I just a low-key you know and then
I come out with the one liner
and good at or one of my islands and my
mom's that was and this was basically
really subtle but I'm loving this I love
a bronze my cure but I've made should I
had a bit back should I keep it brown so
know that you guys are conscious
question right now um I think either
brown through keep it broom I'm loving
it I love me
ibrehem smoke God I don't set up I
didn't set me I on the side drop my ad
in this show you know I am I just add
some of that in the crease so just did
my over off camera and I'm just going to
take the L'Oreal telescopic and apply
some of that first and the winner of my
lashes okay then for lashes I'm going to
be using the house of lash I caught it
okay so four probably but I'm going to
use two primers I'm going to use a
moisturizer you can use any moisturizer
I'm using the PMD moisturizer and and
then I'm going to spray some primer
water as well and my skin gets really
dry around this time of year like in
summer like I'm really really oily and
then it when the woman starts to change
my skin gets dry in certain areas so
using a moisturizer as a primer works
really well for me so if you've got dry
skin use a moisturizer as a primer keep
breaking out lately as well and it's
really frustrated me I'll let you think
it's just because the weather is
changing
fit on how dry you obviously put more
ads on but yeah I'm just going to spray
my face with the primer water by smash
pop okay so for foundation today I'm
actually going to be using the Anastasia
Beverly Hills foundation stick and I'm
going to be using shade tan
I'm a really big fan of this foundation
stick I also love how the flipsie got
shades for everyone every skin tone
there is a foundation fear which isn't
rare for most brands so another reason
why mustache with Anastasia Beverly
Hills okay then to highlight and contour
I'm going to take Anastasia Beverly
Hills this is the banana sticks this is
the highlight stick and when I use this
first of all
and then to contour I'm going to take
the contour stick this is in shade mink
okay so next I'm just going to take the
iconic London strobe stick and I'm just
going to apply some of this to my
cheekbone
as an Altima take my Laura Mercier
translucent powder and my Sigma
concealer blend brush
I'm going to take my anastasiya powder
contour kit it's darker shade right here
okay so what my highlight to be more
intense I have a more glowy so I'm
taking my anastasiya a23 highlight brush
gonna spray some of this with Smashbox
primer and I'm going to take the glow
kit by anastasiya
and I'm going to take shade summer right
here
because now I'm just going to finish
with my eyes taking the Maria palette
I'm going to take this shape is about
right here I'm going to run some of that
under my eye and then on top of that I'm
going to take that darker shade
they're called Violetta I think just
like that advice without
okay so after that I'm going to take the
anastasiya lipgloss and this is in shade
and beau
and then lastly able to spray my face
with the primer water so that is the
finished local hope you guys enjoyed
