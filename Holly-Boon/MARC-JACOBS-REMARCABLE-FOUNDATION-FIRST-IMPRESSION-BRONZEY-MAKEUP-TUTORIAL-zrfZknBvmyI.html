so today when we film in a bronzing
makeup look and I just thought I could
only have Mele these up many of these
are my channel can't speak and I tend to
kind of go for bronzy looks most of the
time just because I have brown eyes and
I feel like it's really flattering on
brown eyes and also it's one of those
looks where it looks good on most people
so yeah and my Kim Kardashian one is a
slightly similar but the eye makeup is
completely different and but the dewy
skin is the same in like Kim Kardashian
mom but have these different products so
yeah and also this is a first
impressions video of the Marc Jacobs
remarkable foundation this is the first
time I've tried it and so far I'm
absolutely loving it I'm really
impressed so yeah if you like this video
please give it a thumbs up and make sure
to subscribe if you haven't already
please excuse my scruffy hair because
she shoved it up because I always do my
makeup before I do my hair so yeah and
I'm going to start with my foundation
today and I'm going to be trying a new
foundation
I ordered the Marc Jacobs remarkable
foundation from Howard's Italy from the
UK that's literally only impatient get
it at the moment anyway and and it had
so many good reviews from it so I am
going to be try this today and so I'm
going to start off my foundation because
my eyes are knowing on my side of my
eyes but I'm not going to be eating
better today so yeah I've had a really
bad break out like Ryan here as well
because I think it's because I've been
really rundown I've had a cold and stuff
so not happy about it but yeah so it
comes in a little this is a package in
and screw it like this and then I think
you just apply it on your face it says
to only apply like three to four dots
because it is super full coverage so you
know so first I want you to prime before
I forget and so I'm going to use the
Nivea from a posh a bomb I have been
using the Smashbox primer for oily skin
and I really wasn't happy with it my
foundation was just like sitting really
funny when I had it all
and so I went here tonight again I used
to read like I'm not really sure why it
did that but you just started by looking
really bad so yeah I've had people say
that you need to be really am hydrated
but we put is foundation on because it's
like super full coverage so I'm going to
spray my face with some mac fix+
I just completed guess my shade like
this and I saw desi Perkins use this
shade so I was like maybe I'm like the
same with her I don't know we're just
going to roll with this for now but I'm
just going to blend it out using my
Beauty Blender
okay so it's definitely a little goes a
long way with this foundation as you can
see that I've only put a few drops on
and it's like super full coverage but
crazy okay so I actually really like the
foundation okay so if you can see I'm
going to be using the Maybelline fit me
concealer and I think this is in light I
do believe
you
okay so I'm not going to set my under
eye yet just because in case I get any
fallout from the eye shadow so I'm going
to move on to my eyes I'm just going to
carve out my eyebrows using this
concealer
so this is Elizabeth Arden brow pencil
and I use natural black and this is the
one I've been obsessing over I'm just
going to go in where I just messed up a
little bit okay so I had to get some
more Laura Mercier Chinese and harder
because this is my favorite and I ran
out and I'm just going to set my eyes so
they don't crease and take this random
brush from I think this is bubala
Bluebell I don't know I read are going
that they say it but they have an
Instagram page I tagged them below they
sent me some brushes and I really really
liked them so I've been using like no
brushes so much lately I have no idea
how this is going to come out but I just
really wanted to do like a really bronzy
makeup look so um we're just going to go
over it so I'm going to be using the Mac
Paint Pot in rubenesque which is
Serena's doll I'm just going to apply
this all over my lid it's going to apply
this with the Sigma 3d HD precision
brush
okay so I'm now taking makeup geek
eyeshadows and I'm going to use this
shade all over my lid and this shade is
magic act which is just a fancy really
nice gold so I'm going to use my mac 242
brush I'm going to apply that over the
lid
okay now taking my locks off to find a
brush by zoeva I'm going to take shape
what is this frappe from makeup geek so
that's this shade here I'm just going to
apply that in the crease
now taking my locs petite crease brush
by zoeva I'm going to take shade Coco
bear from makeup geek which is a shade
here I'm just going to apply that to the
output outer corner of my eye
now taking the warm spectrum palette by
the Weaver I'm just going to take this
shade here then mix it with a bat shade
and apply this on my brow bone
you
and then just to Gary my mac 242 brush
I'm going to go in again with that shade
magic acts like gold shade
okay so now for lashes I'm going to be
using the Aubrey lashes by Jimmy lashes
because these are my absolute favorite
and you can use code Holly B and you get
15% off I say that all the time but it's
so good because they're only like four
or five pounds anyway so then you get
15% off so and then it's show you the
best lashes over our Mitchell obsessed
so yep I'm from this car I'm just going
to apply some mascara first I'm using
the telescopic mascara
it's a wild wash is dry I'm just going
to finish on my face I'm just going to
quickly apply a little bit more
concealer under my eyes is where I had
some fallout
and then I was going to set that using
the laura mercier translucent setting
powder okay so to contour I'm going to
be using the Anastasia Beverly Hills
contour kit
I used to shade cinnamon all the time
and I run out so I'm going to go for
this shade here and the brush I'm using
is the lux cheek brush by zoeva
then breeze that same train I'm just
going to contour my nose
okay so I want this look to be super
glowy bronzy and just go away this is
the peach mosaic shimmer block and again
I'm going to be mixing that shade in
that shone together
the first we're going to be applying
that just sprays the mac fix+ on this
brush and this is the luxe highlight
brush by zoeva
okay then taking this small brush it
hasn't got name is Bai Bo Bell I think
that I say I hope you bail or something
oh I don't know I was going to apply
this light shade from black light light
shade on the tip of my nose and just
here and my Cupid's bow as well it just
makes the end of your nose it more
lifted which is why one because the end
of my nose goes quite drops droops quite
a lot here so I just want it to look a
little bit more lifted and I'm just
going to go in with mary-lou manizer I'm
just going to use a tiny tiny tiny bit
of this just and literally just here
just to intensify it a tiny bit if
you're looking for a really intense
highlight and then mary-lou manizer by
the balm it's so good literally look I'm
just going to finish up my eye makeup so
I'm going to replace the mascara II am
going to apply some mascara to eyes I
haven't done a bronzing look for ages
and I love grungy looks because for my
icon obviously cuz I have brown eyes
it's like the most flattering I look to
do when you've got brown eyes and I just
come down here I just don't even know
why but yeah that's why we did it now
where's my eyes ahead okay now
take it magic act by makeup geek which
is the shade that I used all over the
eyelid I'm going to apply this under my
eye
and then I'm going to take shade cocoa
bear and apply that to the out pothead
so they take mary-lou manizer by the
balm and apply this to my inner corner
stop myself in the eye
oh okay now for bottom lashes I'm going
to fight some mascara
okay where did his lip liner by mu way
um
I can't see what the name is of this
face this anyway but I'll try and find
it in a non-target beret gonna line when
it's at this really like me they're just
taking
meridional bite for mary-lou manizer by
the balm I'm going to high this to
center of my lips then taking this
lipgloss by bare minerals and it's
called head turner and when I reply that
finger the top
and then a theme is going to spray some
mac fix+
okay so I just did my hair off-camera
and why is this free lowdown and but I'm
going to add some white liner into my
waterline just because I feel like it
might make my eyes pop a little bit more
so I'm going to be using the chroma line
and by Mac and this is in pure white and
I'm just going to literally add this
into my waterline I'm going to set that
with a white eyeshadow so taking my warm
spectrum palette by Zoe bar I'm going to
take this shade here I'm just going to
go over the liner the same if you ever
apply black to your waterline if you
then go over it with an eyeshadow it
kind of sets it and then it just doesn't
tend to it just tends to last longer so
there we go I think that looks so much
better just because it makes my eyes pop
a little bit more and that is the
finished look I hope you guys enjoyed
this video and make sure to give it a
thumbs up if you enjoyed it and please
