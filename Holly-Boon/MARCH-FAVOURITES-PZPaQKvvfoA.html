filming a favorites video it's gonna be
completely random is that wouldn't be
just makeup products because I just want
everything that I've been loving in part
so the first thing I want to talk about
just gonna get this out the way my
phrasing a die is the best fiends game
so loads of youtubers have been playing
this game and I was like okay I'll needs
to the hype spot so down I didn't
achieve been obsessed a bit so this is a
game it's called best fiends I'm at
level 23
I like she was up to 1 a.m. this morning
playing this game cuz I'm actually
obsessed and yeah so got to level 23
then link it below so you can download
it it's free to download but it's
honestly the most addictive game ever so
what it is it's bugs versus slugs so
these are the bugs and then you have to
just like kill the slugs right so I've
unlocked all the bugs because I've been
obsessive ever been on it like all the
time so I'm gonna show you how to play
it it's like this I'll put to this level
now where you're like it's like I see
but the first strike sections like you
don't get to this but it's obvious when
you get to level 20 that you get to this
bit anyway so you have to put basically
just join the map but you have to join
up the colors I just realize how
annoying this is speed stick about that
that's basically how you do it you have
to keep doing it and then you have a
defense you have to kill the slog and as
well it's got like so it's as you need
to get 55 of those little mastery and
purple things you have to get 35 of them
and you have to kill the salon super
fast on that ball but yeah if you don't
know it and you can get fast over 24
there's nuts at me because I can't I
physically can't get past it
so I next want to talk about is Missy
Empire play then so I recently got some
irons from here and I'm actually really
like surprised because some Instagram
boutique things I'm a bit like but did
you know what the quality of these funds
are actually really good and so I've got
this dress I'm gonna be posting these on
Instagram so you can see anyway because
I can't really show you in this video
you but um this is the dress it's one of
those have really long v-neck dresses
and then this bit just goes around like
this
but like I said I can show you in this
video but I will be posting on my
Instagram I'll also link them below as
well if you want to pass anything from
them they're not really reasonable a
reason to be reasonably priced at normal
price 20 pound for a dress or whatever
and I also got this wrong neck dress and
just renounced blue colors but this is
gonna be like it's I think it's a it's
not quite long but it's such a nice
color for spring so obviously when I get
into spring so yeah I've been loving
their clothing
so that's another March favorite so now
I'm just gonna move on to makeup so the
best thing I want to talk about is the
Marc Jacobs remarkable foundation I have
been in love with this obsessed a bit I
love a full coverage foundation as you
guys know and this one is perfect for me
because it is full coverage but it
doesn't feel heavy on the skin doesn't
feel like you're wearing loads of makeup
and it's super super matte so if you've
got oily skin like me this is perfect vo
because it's really matte you almost
don't have to set it it almost goes they
might you know have to set it which is
really good
they are literally been obsessed with
this so yeah I know it's like quite
expensive like if you're from the UK I
got it from Harrods and it was like
thirty nine pounds but because you only
need like the tiniest little bit because
a couple initio you need like two or
three drops on your face at a time so it
will last a long time so it's definitely
worth it the next thing I want to talk
about is the Smashbox photo finish
primer water so I decided to patch this
because a man ends and uses this a lot
and I've seen a few youtubers use it and
you know I would youtubers you shoot
you're just like I need together so I
ended up getting this and so far I've
been absolutely loving it I've had it
just over a week now maybe but I've been
really really loving it so as you can
see I'll finally get used it so yeah
I've been loving that it smells exactly
like the mac fix+ it's just really nice
and refreshing and it's just a good buy
month I like it anyway
and the next thing I want to talk about
is eyebrows the Elizabeth Arden natural
black brow Wiz type thing so it's a lot
like their Anastasia brow Wiz but this
one I feel like it's a lot easier to
apply and with the brow Wiz I used to
find it quite hard to get color payoff
and having to put a lot of pressure to
get color payoff where is it this one I
find it really easy also when you then
brush out and blends out really nicely
and yeah I've been absolutely loving
this this is about 17 pounds but
Elizabeth Arden brow pencil is the shed
so yeah I won't just talk about these
eyelashes up today these are the house
of lashes ikonics now I know it's hard
to get these in the UK but I actually
managed to get these off eBay
there's loads on eBay I can't believe
how many of those on there so definitely
check out ego if you want to get these
ashes but I've been upset Lian with them
because I'm still lazy of American
youtubers use them and I've always
wanted to try them but never nine if I
can get them in the UK I went to order
them off the official website until I
saw how much they post the maximum was
and I was like okay maybe not fingers
like $15 or something but yeah so I
wasn't gonna pay that but I absolutely
love them I am obsessed just quickly I
want to talk about these contact lenses
so I've got these contact lenses from
desi oh yeah I used to use these ages
ago and then what happened was is that
because they're from Italy it's kind of
annoying like I'm having to wait for
them to get delivered and they're quite
expensive so I was just like oh I want
to try and buy something cheaper so I
tried the fresh color blends lenses and
I absolutely hated them there was Sion
comments brought in the eyes but you
really felt like you had contact lenses
in and I think that colors were just a
bit too much for me because I like them
to still look a bit natural I've had
only to look really obvious and welcome
ones' so they weren't for me anyway but
yeah I'm talking so fast
what is realized and next thing I want
to talk about is the Mac extended play
mascara now I went into Mac a few couple
weeks ago and there was a guy and then
he was
we ever tried this mascara and I was
like no and he took off my bottom lashes
in a fight so my bottom lashes and I was
like okay I need that like it's so
good for bottom lashes and not so much
top last year's on it doesn't get much
volume because I wear false lashes
anyway it is a pretty much I so I have
been loving this this mom definitely
this you know you don't ok next thing I
want to talk about is dose of colors
Bellini lip gloss so I love those two
colors I love their liquid lipsticks
I've got um does its wave right here
where there's quite a lot I just love
the formula it doesn't dry my lips out
doesn't it feel horrible and yes I've
been loving them so what did you try
that up glosses because I love that
liquid lipsticks and this is just like a
really nice gloss I can switch watch it
on my hand for you it's really pigmented
as well it's pretty much like I've got
Reesie
on my lips at the moment by lip bland
but it's basically the same kind of
color but it's just a shimmery gloss tea
it's really really nice and really
pigmented broke laughs open up so you
love in it so yeah this is another one
of my favorite things this month okay so
I've been talking about this on my
snapchat and I'll just share it with you
it's called the cute nutrition and it's
a meal replacement and it's a weight
loss one it's 130 calories per shake and
it's kind of like you know when you just
really found something suede like you
really want like a snack
and they said of Gover chocolate I'll
just get have one of these and also I've
had I've been having like one for
breakfast and they're not one before and
evening meal and it's been like filling
me up to the point where when I try to
get my ease and evening meal or don't
eat as much so I hope it up City loving
this as you can see I've used quite a
lot of it
my cops are there now it was after that
I already had it like this two weeks ago
and so I open up seeing loving it it
tastes so good like I'm trying to say
Amen email replaces before and they've
just been like I just couldn't stop I
couldn't deal with the smell just the
taste and everything I'll just like off
but this literally tastes like yeahso
milkshake mine makes my mouth water not
milk just
I prefer it that way I don't like
skimmed milk so I just mix it with water
and it tastes so good so if you're
looking for something to help with
weight loss I'm not in by any means I
some sort of a nutritionist or anything
I'm just finding that I think this works
it just helps to throw you up before
meals so you don't eat as much so yeah
okay so that is everything I hope you
