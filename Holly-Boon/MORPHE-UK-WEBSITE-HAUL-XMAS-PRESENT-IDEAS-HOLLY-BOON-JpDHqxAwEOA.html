youtube channel my name is holly Boone
if a new hair hello or welcome to my
channel I'm really sorry today was
supposed to be a makeup tutorial but I
filmed the footage it took me two hours
and then I went back to edit it and it
was great I don't know why if anyone
knows how to sort out my camera settings
let me know I'm actually feeling on a
different camera today I'm filming a
vlogging camera I don't like to put
makeup stores on this because it does
have a boo in skin self note which means
it's often just skin and you kind of
look a little bit more airbrush with
this camera and we've makeup stores I
want something raw you can see exactly
what I'm let's get an excite we don't
talk about okay so if my skin looks
exceptionally good in this video it's
because of this camera and it's just
only a 5 100 if you're wondering so I
was gonna wait in my color pop stuff got
delivered so we could even wharfing in
color pop in this video because I did
order some stuff from their butts
because I ordered it from America it's
gonna take a long time to come I don't
have to play custom but every think
about that anyway so today is just gonna
be more fair so I did get noisy things a
lot of it was sold out because morphe
now have a UK website if you guys don't
already know they have a UK website
which I'm so thankful for because I mean
it's 2017 this should have been here
years ago
I am Amalfi's PR but obviously I still
do find myself like I'm not gonna go if
you just give me everything do not I
mean no first thing I've got wisdom of
the morphe premium lashes I've never
tried these eyelashes before and I was
just really interested there any 10
pounds so I was like it
and what's up so their preview - is that
made from top quality synthetic fibers
and which I love see I picked up these
ones which are long I love long
eyelashes and they're quite wispy and
these are in the style sophisticated so
I think these are definitely more me
than these ones these other ones I
picked up for a bit shorter there's
still wispy but they're just a bit
shorter than these ones these ones are
so long and I love my eyelashes to let
you touch my eyebrows or touch the top
of my head like that's just what I like
but these ones which are bit shorter and
still wispy if you want shorter lashes
these are nice and these are in this
style I traction I
okay so these ones are in the style
attraction which is the shorter ones but
they also I like on they start off
shorter in the other corner and they
kind of get longer to the outer corner
of your eye I really like that actually
and then we've got these sophisticated
eyelashes because I'm a sophisticated
Mitch yes these ones are obviously way
longer and they're kind of the same sort
of length all the way around and they're
just quite wispy these things I like I
like dramatic over-the-top long AF
eyelashes okay so the next thing I
picked up was the draw attention tempies
color pencil collection for eyes and
lips I like how you can use these and
eyes on lips because I always use my lip
liners in my waterline and vice versa I
mean I do clean it first
don't worry okay I'm going to swatch
this because I want to see what the
textures like if they're creamy if
they're quite stiff first one is in the
shade backseat love I'm gonna swatch
these on my hand like I said oh yeah
they're really creamy yes and they're
really creamy I'm very pigmented so love
that I would love to you something like
my what a water line you know it's just
so nice next we have sweet tea which is
definitely my kind of shade for lip
liner which is this darkest brown shade
love that and these are very creamy and
nice they're not you know how sometimes
you get some pencils and they're like
really stiff and you're like trying to
get color payoff these ones aren't like
that this one they're really good and so
the next one is caviar which again is a
brown bits a lighter brown that one's
nice as well so that one there is caviar
that would be perfect for a lip liner
for me we're sending one yeah I do like
a brown as the waterline especially if
you have brown eyes sometimes black can
be too harsh so do you like to use brown
it really makes your brown eyes pops if
you've not done that before you need to
try it
also if you bring it down a little bit
under the waterline it kind of smudge it
out and it just gives you that oh I just
make sure I brown eyes pop wanna see
it's just so it's so nice so next one is
bite me bite me bitch
which is more a chocolatey Brown so that
one there and next we have Hoover Wow
that one's very creamy love that like
this brand is so inexpensive and I'm
just like I'm sick every time anyway the
next one is clingy which is that one
which is a bit lighter than the one
before then we have bar the next shade
which is like a very dark brown some
more like a ready Brown start warmed
there and we have coconut which is a
white yours in a white liner then we
have Ricci which is kind of like a
brownie black it's almost like a off
black you know a minute and then lastly
we have a black which is called dark
room so just a black a black one I love
those I think they're really nice just
from swiping them on my arm I can tell
when you move and when it comes to lip
liners and stuff like when I go in the
store and I'm looking for lip liners or
eyeliners the first thing I look for
when i swatched them is if they're
pigmented and creamy I don't have to be
like that because I don't want to put on
my eyes on my lips trying to get color
payoff these ones like you can see are
very creamy and very pigmented and that
was only like one or two swipes so yeah
I'm very impressed with them so then I
picked up the morphe 35o palette because
I wanted some color in my life I mean I
already have quite a bit of color but at
Collinwood the colors in one palette so
I don't have to keep switching and using
different planets and stuff so yeah I've
got blues purples greens pinky Purple's
Reds orange and yellow that bright
yellow that is an itchy animal that's so
bright I also got some shimmers in here
yeah I mean if you haven't had a morphe
palette before I definitely recommend
getting one you get so video I tell you
money it's actually crazy and like I
said sometimes I find that some of them
aren't as good as the others like
someone is taking me to do the office
it's a little bit inconsistent but I
mean overall I just think it's just
they're just so worth it because it's me
not that expensive and yeah just I'll
just watch a couple anyway okay so
that's one of the shades out of the
Payette that's one of the matchday so
that's the purple I've just watched one
of this shimmer so you can see that
otherwise just washes pink one so that's
one of the shimmer shades which is a
really power
pink also if you haven't seen the
individual foiled shadows that they do
they are so good I love them so much
whenever I want to do a fool shadow I
just use them I have so many of them the
only thing I have the only problem I
have with them is I I break them drop
stuff all the time and if you drop it
literally from that height it was my
gosh everywhere so just yeah just be
careful about that but they're very good
they're very very good dates for each
other if you're not tried them
definitely get yourself something
they're not expensive at all okay so the
next thing I picked up was the morphe
paint that's how nude plush liquid lip
this is a set of three liquid lipsticks
I love the liquid lipstick formula I've
had it before I really really like it
it's really really good it's not too dry
and it definitely stays on all day which
I like so I like when I look for a
liquid level way to be comfortable
see ya in this set you get these three
nude shades I'm already obsessed I don't
even swatch them out the colors are just
unreal
oh the packaging by the way they
operated the packaging and I it's so
gorgeous oh just this is nicer it's just
more I don't know
it looks more like serious so the first
one is called sweets which is the
lightest shade so that one is called
sweets which is the paler one out of the
three that is stunning
I probably went all over my lips just a
little bit too light for me but I would
definitely write in the center of my
lair um but yeah that's gorgeous
so next of the shade Lulu which is the
middle shade after three so yeah that
shade though it's called Lulu then the
darkest one out to set is called dainty
okay this one's me this one is something
that I wear everyday this one I love
that I would let you wear every day that
is so nice
okay and then picked up the more feeds
25a palette which is apparently limited
edition oh my go I love this this is
this is I think I picked this up because
this is something that I would go to I
always go to Browns and stuff like when
I'm going out because it just goes of
everything and it complements my brown
eyes so much so there's the times that I
go to so I kind of went them all in one
palette so I just have one palette that
I just go to remember I kind of have
like a few shades that have one put
their lives in a few shades that have
another play
like I just kind of win them all
together so that's why I picked up this
palette and I loved it I literally love
that shirt so I won there just watch a
couple of shades for you as you can see
okay so that's one of the matte shades
yeah I definitely shades in this one are
a bit more pigmented than the one from
the other colorful palette just from
doing one swipe back in his tail he's
and what this is more a foil chatter
than a shimmer I love that that's again
so much more pigmented than the shimmers
this one's more before shadow
I love which others because I just think
there's so much more pigmented and
they're just they look so much better
they stand out more to me than using
shimmers foil Chinese are definitely
like my favorite favorite shadows okay
so I then picked up this morphe
concealer stick in the shade toasted
marshmallow I think I got this for like
contour this is actually a lot smaller
than I thought it would be it's tiny
yeah I picked this up for contour
because I like to cream ponds as you
guys know and I just thought this might
be better I mean that's definitely a bit
too warm this is the problem when you
when you order stuff online you try and
color pick things online it's just a
nightmare
I do like a warm creme for like a
bronzer but if you can see that it's the
best color for me to use for a cream
bronzer and but it's very creamy I'd
like to use this for concealer I didn't
get a natural concealer shakes I think
it was up stock I think this wife walked
our try it for contour that's that and
then I donut picked up I've had this
concealer before this is a full coverage
concealer and this in the shade nude I
don't particularly I sand under my eyes
because it does crease because it is
quite full coverage but I do love it for
kind of doing the highlight down the
bridge of my nose and just kind of like
spot concealing and stuff I really like
it for that and I did use all of the one
that I had before so I needed to get
other ones so yeah if you've not tried
this before I would recommend it but
probably not for your under eye like
just from doing that you can see how
full coverage that is it's quite a thick
concealer but yeah it's really good for
the bridge of my nose and sometimes I
also bring it down
Simon oceanographers console Khan effect
and distancing is really good for that
so I did pick up a morphe brush that I
would assume what I brushes I don't have
that many from morphe I have mostly from
Sigma I just wanted to get some more
morphe brushes because I do have some
and I love them so I'm going to get some
more so the first brush is the morphe
what one is this okay there are numbers
on them
that's kind of annoying okay these
brushes cuz they were inset they don't
actually have numbers on them that's
three annoying so they come to tutorials
I can't tell you what brush is anyway so
this first one is I've got a fluffy
blending brush like this it's very very
soft I really like these brushes like I
said I already have some and I just I
love them so yeah that one's more fluffy
brush story that I have numbers it's
really annoying but this set was a lot
so if you are looking for some eye
brushes definitely get these because
whenever I want to get like I brush sets
like I never find a brush set that has
all of the eye brushes that I want and
they always have some on like a have
never use that never use Olivia do not I
mean but with this I say every single
brush in this eye set I will use yeah
got three fluffy brushes here I mean
this one's more flat this first one this
one's more of a plane and then this was
just more like fluffy fluffy and then
you've got this kind of like short
shader brush which it's like this which
is good for kind of like under the eye I
would say or just kind of if you're
going to press on glitter or anything
like that it's very small and it's just
gonna be good for like small details so
that's that brush then you also have the
same sort of thing but even smaller
which is perfect because we're doing
your under eye say you're using a black
or something and you want to get close
to your waterline and you kind of want
to smudge it out and you want to be very
very careful without you know getting
black everywhere this little detail
brush is gonna be perfect for that and
then we have this eyeliner brush which
is so thin I need one of these like I
need one of these for so long
and it's like that it's very very very
fine and very pointy so they'll be
perfect for I'm gonna try it for a wing
it might not work that well for a Winx
it's very thin but when I do like a
black line so that my lashes blend in
this this would be perfect for them okay
this one for me is big too big but I
shot it but what I would use it for is
if I put concealer on my eyes and I want
to set it with translucent powder i will
use this brush just set my concealer on
my lids that's that one and then we have
this which is a really dense little
pointy brush which is good for detail
especially if you put in a shade in the
crease this would be good for that it'd
also be good for your inner corner
highlight and your singh a brow
highlight and then you have the same
sort of thing again but even smaller
which is good again
I would use this for the same sort of
thing in a corner highlight brow bone
just little tiny details and then you
have an angled brush with a spoolie on
the end which you could use for your
brows for me it's a little bit too thick
from my eyebrows I like my brow brush if
I'm doing like a comment or something it
to be a lot of thinner than that it's a
little bit too thick for me so I
personally would use that for eyebrows
but I was different definitely use this
and just not that angled end and then we
have this brush which is like this which
I would probably use for my concealer
under my brows to carve out my eyebrow
just get that very sharp neat Brown and
then we have this brush which is a very
dense rounded brush I would use this to
apply a shade all over the lid so and I
taught it all over the lid but also with
this type of brush I will use it to do
the highlight down the bridge of my nose
as well I think these types of brushes
worked really well for that but overall
this eye set is really good it's not
expensive at all and every single brush
in here I would use the only brush I
wouldn't use is that angled brush just
because it's a little bit too thick for
me but everything else I would use so I
definitely recommend if you're looking
for a good eye brush set especially if
you want to get someone up for Christmas
or something like that
yeah that's their well they also come in
a little case which is nice so yeah that
is everything I've got
it would all be linked in the
description box below
I said morphine a half a UK website

think I brought anything from this brand
it's perfect Christmas brothers because
it's inexpensive and it's good quality
