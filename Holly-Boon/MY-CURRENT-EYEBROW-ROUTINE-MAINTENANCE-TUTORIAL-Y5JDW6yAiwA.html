tutorial just in depth about how I do my
eyebrows because I don't always do my
eyebrows in tutorials so I thought I
would do a separate video about my
eyebrows and what I use and how I try
and go growing my eyebrows how I
maintain my eyebrows I'm just gonna tell
you everything and I'm going to show you
like how I actually fill them in and
stuff so so first of all I'm going to
show you how I fill them in and then I'm
going to talk to you about how I
maintain them and stuff so the first
thing I like to use is I use the Anasazi
of Beverly Hills brow gel I feel like
you need a brow gel because it really
helps to hold your hairs in place so I
feel like a brow gel it's just like a
must in my opinion yes I like to brush
them in kind of like this direction and
then they start on my brow the front of
my brow I kind of just like brush the
hairs up a tiny bit so yeah once I've
applied the brow gel and I've tried
blows brow gels and honestly this is the
only one that works for me anyway so
what I like is for my eyebrows I move
lately I've just open more like a more
of a natural brow at my natural brow but
just fill in the sparse areas now like
sometimes I do like a real strong bitch
brow bar I mean most the time lately I
just like more of a natural brow so I
used the benefit precisely my brow
pencil I felt this is one of the best
eyebrow pencils on the market I also
like the NYX brow pencil but I just
don't had an offer at the shade range
isn't as good as benefit because I feel
like with with the next ones or even
like really dark like so dark or they're
like warm and I don't like warm brows so
well warm browser music stupid because
the hairs really cool tone so so what I
like to do is start by kind of like
underline in the brow really really
lightly so always that all the way here
I'll just start right here because I
don't want there to be a line underneath
this Park so I'm going to keep it quite
sparse so what I'd like to do is just
start by underlining the brown I'm just
following my natural shape okay then
after that I will draw the top line but
really really lightly I'll just carve
out the shape of the brow
so I'm just following the hairs and
following the natural shape of my brow
and here I have a bit of a sparse area
so I'm going to just go this Pitons
really really lightly and then I'm gonna
just join the two lines together like
that now you can see where's a few
sparse there is that they've got a
little bit of a sparse area here and
then it kind of just throughout the
eyebrow so then I just like to kind of
like just create a little stroke so I'm
not I'm literally not applying hardly
any pressure with this pencil I'm
literally just applying it really
lightly as light as I can because I
really don't want my brows to look like
I've filled them in that March Atomics
then then I hit the spoolie end of the
brow pencil and just brush through the
hair and then again I'll just kind of
like keep going back and forth and just
keep filling it in a little bit more if
I want to and just until I'm happy so
then with the front of my brown I'm
gonna just really really really lightly
connect this line and then what I'll do
at this end is all kind of brush that
line out a little bit so it's not as
hard so you can literally not even see
it what I will do is just gently really
lightly
create little blokes with this pencil so
just literally again I'm not applying
that kardi any pressure I try and do it
from this place you can see you I'm
doing so I'm just literally creating
tiny little hair strokes using this
pencil so I'm making my brow look fuller
without it looking completely drawn on
after that I would take the brow gel
again and I will run it through the brow
again just to make sure those hairs
completely stay in place because I
really don't want those hairs to move
and let you my pet hey is where like
you're halfway through the day and then
your overhead starts to like go down I
hate that so you really do need to
invest
an eyebrow gel if you want your brows to
stay in place all day I was thinking
about getting micro blade in on my
eyebrows because I only need the tiniest
bit filling them in I thought maybe if I
get microwaved in and just get that you
know they like to do little hairs for
you it's like it's like a tattoo but it
needs little hair strokes and it looks
so natural and I was thinking about
trying it out because I think she don't
even need to fill my eyebrows in that
much so I mean if somebody could just
like do that and then I wake up my
eyebrows I've just done and I've just
saved my life say I'll just be so much
better
everybody said snapped eyebrows all the
time so I might look into that I want to
try it out and then I can let you guys
know what I think about it or whatever
so yeah that is literally how I do my
eyebrows all the time recently I just
referred them to look more kind of
natural if I mean I thought they do look
naturally I mean that I really let you
put them in the tiniest bit and I adds
like the lightest amount of product and
I do use this Brad Mansur window shades
6 so is the darkest what you can get but
yeah I love that Provence oh it's so
creamy it's really easy to use again I
like the NYX one bigger if you want to
get one that's like not as expensive
then get the next one but the color
range isn't as good some of them are
quite warm especially if you have cool
tone hair like me
I started how I maintain my eyebrows and
why do so I plucked my own eyebrows I
don't let anyone touch my eyebrows I'm
really funny about it
I've never had my eyebrows ready I've
never had my eyebrows waxed
I've actually plucked my eyebrows since
I was about 13 12 13 I've cut my brush
since then and and I think you just
pluck that underneath and then like just
like the top and then I was like brush
the hairs up and then I'll just like
trim them with the scissors and stuff if
I throw out there too long because my
eyebrows do grow quite long and they
grow quite quick as well and my eyebrows
grow really quick which I'm really
grateful for because I remember near 9 I
neatly tucked my eyebrows into nothing
and it was a hot mess it was a trend
then I feel like every other thin
eyebrows it was a thing but I'm just
glad they grew back
thank God anyway so I recently heard
about this technique and I've been using
this on my eyelashes and I'll let you
guys know if it works but I'm just gonna
like let you guys know in case you want
to try it as well with me and so I
picked up from Holland and borrow this
oil this is a 100% natural oil and
apparently if uses some your eyebrows or
your eyelashes it helps to strengthen
them and might help them to grow so I
mean I'm in the process of trying this
out I put this on my eyebrows and we're
eyelashes every night before bed
and I really been doing it for like five
or six days now so I'm going to update
you let you guys know I took her before
picture and then when I kinda do it for
like two months and then taking up a
picture for it that's a good enough time
to know and then I'll let you guys know
actually works but if you want to try
this with me
you wanna go on the journey with me then
get yourself some oil I think I bought
this for like five pound from Holland
about common bath it was a lot anyway
but yeah that's pretty much what I do I
was hitting my eyebrows for a long time
as you guys know I told you like what I
write in I use and how I set my hours
and stuff but honestly I'm gonna stop
doing that because I did it so often I
was in every two weeks he got to the
point where they worked so harsh and so
they look like I've drawn them on time
and they look so like which is too harsh
and every time I would just try and make
them look a bit natural with my brow and
so it was just making them darker and
they were just looked so drawn on I just
couldn't I couldn't do it so I stopped
hitting my eyebrows and now I just
prefer the way they look I do like like
I said sometimes I do like a pomade and
I like a really sharp you know a bitch
brow I could do like a bitch sometimes
but most of the time ie I prefer this
technique I just think it looks more
natural and just yeah I just prefer it
so yeah that's how I do my eyebrows yeah
I hope you guys enjoyed this video
please give it a thumbs up please
subscribe and I will see you in my next
video but yeah if you want to if you
want to try this journey with me with
the e oil and see if it works and by all
means get some I'm gonna try it up took
a before picture like I says and I'll
give it a couple of months and see if
actually works because my eyelashes are
like little stumps so I mean I need them
to grow so yeah I'll let you know about
that but I hope you guys enjoyed it give
it a thumbs up subscribe and I'll see
you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
