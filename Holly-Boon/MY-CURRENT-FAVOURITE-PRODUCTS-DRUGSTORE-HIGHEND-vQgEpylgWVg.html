favorites video today I don't do these
monthly just because I don't find a lot
of things every month that I love so I
don't feel like it's worth making a
video on it and I wish you will find
that to theme that I like out of the
month I can never find like loads of
things suck about so I thought I would
just do a favorite video comes on one in
so long and there's loads of products
that I've been obsessed with I've been
wearing constantly I've been using
constantly so I thought I would just
share them with you since what we're
going to be in this video and this track
see by the way so nice is some pretty
little thing and which is like a cropped
hoodie like this and it's got much in
bottoms I'm obsessed I Lutz you love
this color it's so nice and summery and
I love Traxxas it's a minute I'm just
such a tracksuit kind of gal lately at
eight-minute and anyway let's crack on
so I'm just going to randomly pick stuff
but I'm just going to work my way
through this stuff so the first thing I
talk about is my favorite foundation at
the minute and that is the L'Oreal True
Match mixed with the infallible total
cover this to me is like a do best
drugstore combination foundation I have
ever used them on entire life so as you
guys know I used to use this one quite a
lot by itself this is very similar to
the Giorgio Giorgio Armani Loomis the
foundation it's very very very similar I
know they're made in the same factory so
that's probably why yeah that one's very
similar if you have the Giorgio my
numerous silk then I would recommend
trying this because it's pretty much
exactly the same and so yeah I like full
coverage as you guys know I love a full
coverage foundation but I don't like a
super matte finish I used to love to see
from up finish but lately as it's
getting with someone I don't like format
face I once still what a bit of like
satin finish not doing I can't a 20-week
skin because I'm oily so I do like a
satin finish so this foundation common
wasting ever gives me that perfect
foundation coverage and side finish
where I love love love love love
CC foundations together or so they're
very inexpensive and not expensive at
all and I think this was like 7 pounds
since I was pretty about the same 14
miles you get two foundations which will
last you such a long time because you
need a little bit of each time so in
this one I use the shade golden amber
and then in this one I use the shade
angle which is number 282 on this one
yeah I wouldn't everything below the
guys when I get it but I really
recommend the foundation combo if you
want a full coverage satin finish I use
a little bit of this while I don't run
my face and then I apply this one on top
using my Sigma 3d render and it's just
yet my favorite so next almost have
black concealers I have three to series
that I have been obsessed with over the
last few months and so I've got two
high-end ones and a drugstore one so
I've got the NARS radiant creamy
concealer I love to change their doings
conceal I feel like they do it a
ricocheted range into shape everyone and
when I write boys hands and I don't want
as bright on dry I need a darker
concealer and I find hard to find out
that continues with the right under time
for my skin in drugstore so this is one
of my absolute go shoes it is expensive
but like I said the shade range is
amazing if you can't find a shade in
there soda over there this is really
good also it is medium to full coverage
I say food with full coverage and it
doesn't crease so with this concealer I
think everyone's a favorite of mine and
I get the shade ginger which is medium
too so when I just want to conceal I
don't want he really brought under I see
ya r3hab Reb so I'm just right upstairs
I'm going to go drink and is about said
unsalted anyway yeah not as radiant
creamy concealer you can't go wrong with
it's pretty free power thing and
admittedly you don't get a lot of
product which is annoying but it's just
always gonna be a favorite one next I've
got the tart shape tape in the shade
light/medium this is a little bit too
light for me and it gives me a really
bright under-eye which is good obviously
I do like that sometimes I do like that
look but to get in the UK is so hard
they do sell it on QVC it is really
expensive not like that 30 st. pounds on
QVC which is obviously a joke I do know
it's hot
I deal on shipping this week well last
week remember where anyone from you can
get free shipping which was amazing
obviously and so I think a lot of people
took advantage of that but I am really
running out of this now are dating want
to repurchase it just because of the
price and I feel like it is a really
good concealer but there's also other
really good concealers that aren't
expensive so yeah very small coverage if
you guys want a really full opportunity
that blends out ninety I'm not bad where
so much concealer other than it's just
too expensive for me because we don't
have tight in the UK and I you to start
spending so much money on makeup because
it's a day then what is that using more
like affordable stuff for you guys
because I thought I use a lot of hi
alleys I am lucky enough in privileged
enough to be able to for high-end but I
just forget that sometimes you know I
never use data for this so I need
to stop buying such expensive which
I actually find some good drugs for
stuff so I'm going to do a lot more
drugstore things don't worry actually
really went fair at a drugstore I just
fell back in a day when I was growing up
drugs that was really bad there wasn't
really anything to shave ranges and if
it were so bad this all the products
just would crap I just yeah just never
looks good on me at all so I feel like
drugs already up their games I'm
definitely out for trying more things so
yeah keep an eye out I am going to be
doing more drugstore things on my
channel and be a this is a another
favorite of mine is amazing the eraser I
perfect and cover concealer in the shade
light I love this concealer that
you guys can see that I've never had is
that long thing about it like two weeks
and it's itching any gone I've been
using it so much so we've got the shade
light which gives me a very bright
under-eye which I live for sometimes but
the shade ranging this isn't great I
know they are bringing out more shades I
have been told and that is that's true
or not I don't know okay but hopefully
they do because this concealer is really
really good it's really full coverage
and it blends that very nicely I think
any cruisin with it it's pretty much
light and tartrates taupe surveillances
fotona and yeah it's really good I
really like it I haven't got bad with so
much because he likes really you know
expensive so they bring out more shades
of this I won't even need to buy that
NARS radiant creamy because at the
moment thing do like
nude in store or online is different but
yeah the current wait time to bring up
most of this I'll be loving life
okay so brow was always a rut browse
this is only already been using this
product for about three weeks on and off
sometimes a lot more of an app to ransom
as I divide bro and this is for when I
wanted to find for our abusers today so
yeah it's the Cabrera buy benefit in the
shade number six it's basically a pomade
it's a lot like the other sizes beverly
hills dipbrow i don't know in would ask
the price which ones mess expensive i
don't know but the focus is good so if
you're going off price just get the one
that's a tubers because i buy exactly
the both dishes gives each other but the
only reason i use this one is slightly
darker than the ones i have of the
Anasazi over hills I only have medium
brown and chocolate brown so they're
like a little bit light up when I
someone's like a lighter brown but this
was when I want a full on so cut me
sharp and will cut you with my eyebrows
I've so yeah this stuff is so good
it comfortable it over a little brush
tournament so I don't have to use a
little brush but you could do is
actually such a nice brush its wreath in
make it for eyebrows but I just have my
my favorite eyebrow brush which is the
zoeva uses a weaver winged liner brush I
use up on my brows it's really good I
love that so that's what I'm afraid yeah
love this Cabrera for loving that will
say when I want already more natural
fluffy brow I use the benefit precisely
my brow pencil it's one of my absolute
favorite it's really creamy to blend in
easy to work with and yet just gives
more of a natural finish to your brow
rather than a redefined so depending on
what mood I'm in I use either those this
one or that one so I'm still good at 100
miles per hour
and so much I've stuck up okay so these
are really been introduced into my life
the last two weeks and I am cess
disease obsess they are on her so these
are the morphe pressed pigment i use one
of these this is my favorite Rodeo Drive
in my last tutorial and I chose it in
its lashed so I'm really
but I must repurchase it you have these
on beautybay movement open ax it's going
to drop everywhere actually the other
shades so this shade is high class which
is arena bronzy gold shade looks like
this I'll swatch it for you guys can see
how amazing these are look at this I
can't even deal with our formal shadows
they just work amazing and you get a lot
of products for money there's three
rounds of products in here and honestly
there are amazing I'm honestly just like
what the they like the makeup geek
for your shadows those actually like
that but they come in a little part
which is quite nice and you get the so
many colors I'll let you have so many
kinds of these I'm obsessed
see how this one is one of my favorites
and this is in the shade high class my
other favorite is Rodeo Drive where
tries to watch this about dropped and it
broke I'm going to try and then watch to
show fear because it's like a really
natural rose gold shade here
Sabrina a rose gold rose that was more
of a bronzey gold but I love this rose
rose gold fellow youth in my my
tutorials the problem tutorial uses
color so amazing it's like you bet so
too for this so nice and then my other
favorite aid is powder room and this is
a really light pink
that's this shade right here it's more
silvery uncommon but it's just got like
reflexive pink in it it's really pretty
you could use it for henna corner
highlight as well but I touched even my
free soap three favorite shades are sets
that's a nice okay so let's talk about
highlights so I've got a liquid and a
powder so my liquid favor eye light is
on this is the iconic London illuminate
drops in the shade original I just lift
these are so amazing I just will never
stop using them I'll just swatch them on
my hand so you guys can see fear if you
don't already know you need to get to
know this is how amazing they are and I
just put them underneath my powder hide
i and it makes it a lot more intense and
I love a bright highlight as you guys
and I can also mix it in with your
foundation if you want a really dewy
foundation that works amazing as well
they have three different shades have
got a light shade and a dark shade and I
use the original shade which is like the
middle shade
bayar obsessed with them and then my
favorite powder highlight has to be that
Oprah has made and nikkietutorials ever
blow it's like solid and archived in ice
watch this as well fear that come is and
I fight even I love it's got three
shades I like mixing these two shades
together I love this one for inner
corner highlight and then those I mix it
to for my cheekbones and then this is
obviously going to be amazing and if you
like darker skin beautiful eye but this
from work for so many different skin
tones because you've got the light the
medium and then the dark side as well
the issue the world to highlight and if
you can buy this separate or if you have
to buy it with the Nicki set if the up
spite of the Nicki set it's definitely
worth it because she's got liquid
lipsticks as well which I really nice
okay so I'm doing this in such a random
order by was about Prime and X and so I
have been using this constantly this is
the urban became rehab makeup prep this
is so hydrating and so nice it's all
free
it just feels unbelievable in this on
the skin I can't even describe the
texture of this
it's basically water-based it just feels
amazing whose you put your face it just
literally melts and it smells like water
and your skin just so hydrated that's
why it's going to be so good for by your
skin vice oily and dry dry skin it's
going to be insane fierce is so
hydrating in and and also if you're oily
like me this isn't going to make you any
more Elia before this court based its
not real based so this has been my
favorite primer at the moment I wish you
love it and then also I've been using
the benefit professional this is really
really good for minimizing your pores it
moves them out it practically makes them
invisible when you put makeup on it's
really really really good and it's
really lightweight oil-free and it's
like a translucent color so really nice
really really nice and then I've also
been using the Urban Decay makeup lip
gloss this is a sheer butter coconut
little moisturizer it's really really to
get it really good as well I used to use
a Mac lip conditioner I still
live by that that's like of new stuff
over here and it she loved that but this
was just as good as well
I'm so nice and this one's got like
coconut sin so that is really nice as
well yeah I love a dip prep so not not
many people prep their lips and apply my
but it just makes a world of difference
it honestly does okay so next time
screens talk about power it is because
iPad or a lot because I am all ye so
these are like my three top paradis so
the first one is a Laura Mercier
translucent powder this one is amazing
in my opinion because I part on my face
I don't have to them very part of my
face for about five or six hours my skin
will stay matte it won't start producing
shine it's really really good it just
keeps my face non-shiny for very very
long time so I love that forever put
this will forever be my absolute
favorite it is my favorite of them free
this one is just so worth the money and
I just can't find a powder as good so
yes Laura Mercier and the next one is
the original are Simona color powder
this one is also amazing but the only
problem I have with this is it doesn't
hold the shine so I will powder my face
of this and then I have to repaint
powder on my face again after a couple
of hours because I'll start getting
shiny again in like my forehead my
t-zone so yeah I will have to repower
doubt if I use this one after a couple
of hours which is kind of annoying but
it's a really good price it's very
inexpensive if you aren't very oily this
is going to be perfect for you because
you get no flashback it is a no color
powder and it will stop short under eyes
increasing and it will just do the job
perfect if you want a cheaper powder and
you don't mind repowering everything
around if it really or if you aren't
oily this is perfect for you and then
the next one you scale up my on-the-go
power i bits and my focus benefits and
the handbag this is the one that I take
with me when I'm going places because I
don't wanna be taken this out of
meanness punished powder my face
I'll actually just use this so this is
the auntie shine shine banishing Pro
powder from benefit it comes with a
little brush on the end like this and
you just open it up twist it around put
the product in the things in the lid
like this and I'll just apply it like
that
it's so handy it's a really good powder
and it's just so handy to have any
handbag if you're going out on a night
out and you need to take some time
review so I'm just going to chuck in a
cream bronzer and a powder bronzer that
obsessive as well so the Korean bronze
that I've been using is the iconic
London pigment stick in the shade 4.3
it's very very dark as you guys can see
but it really helps to warm up my face
if I want to use a cream and not powder
also sometimes I'll fill up when I use a
purchase the powder it doesn't warm up
my face as much so if I need to really
move my face upon very times I will use
this and then I will use a powder on top
so yeah the iPhone under pigment stick
in the shade 4.3 is really bendable
really creamy love that and then I like
to use the mineralized skinfinish by Mac
in the shade dark deep I used to use a
show give me Sun but it wasn't as dark
as I would like so I went for dark
feasts instead so I've been loving this
lately and yeah this will always be my
absolute favorite I just feel like this
is like one of the best ones as ever I
know it's not rushing bronze on it's a
mineralized skinfinish I find their
bronzers from that quite chalky and they
go quite patchy so I don't actually like
the bronzers from that but I love the
mirror i skin finish in this color it's
like perfect okay let's talk about
lashes
I love these at it so clearly lashes
awful severe and I'm also I love the
clicking ashes in a more which is the
ones I have one at the moment these are
just so nice I think there's a website
called false eyelashes still cloudy okay
don't quote me but I'm pretty sure it's
cool and you can get these on there for
like six seven pounds of things okay and
they're so nice I want to see I love
them so much
these are like really good they're
little bit more longer and a little bit
more dramatic than the iconic Qasr
blushes so if you want a little bit more
dramatic lash than these are for you
you know me I love it oh my gosh I feel
like my daytime lashes are peoples
evening lashes I'm so like give me the
most for lashes you have because
that's what I need so I love them and
then I've also got Lily lashes I'm
obsessed with it I'll show you guys with
these actually look like so you can
probably see these royalties really nice
and alone and they're just more like a
daytime lash from
not to to my egg but asymptomatic which
I love to these are more of a data right
in a spinel so these ones are in the
style Arica and these are way more to my
egg and these are what I would wear in
the evening I literally love these ones
are so nice and they were so bandless so
the band is clear which is really nice
because if we don't want to wear
eyeliner these are really nice they
don't have that black strip they have
renounced date online they just have
very dramatic lashes which is one about
one better to make lush life you know me
okay so cheered my favorite liquid lip
formulas at the moment a dose of credits
and like the Marc Jacobs these are
actually liquid lipstick this one is
more like a cream yeah this is a cream
liquid lip so it's not completely matte
and this one is matte so this one is in
the shade knock on word from dose of
colors I love this one i always wear at
anyone's was like what shade is up I'm
like you need to get to know is that
this very nice brown shade and it's just
really nice of a Bree brownie nude I
love brownie news and my skin I just may
look so much better than pinky knew that
this is looking Kim you today but I just
prefer brownie nudes to pinky nudes
that's just me and then this one is a
lip cream Marc Jacobs this is in the
shade which is this you want to try and
this is the color again it's a very like
peachy nude so if you guys can't even
see this it's a very peachy nude it's
very light color so item to top put this
one on top of other colors because I
can't wear this on its own so it's too
light for me but I like to pair this
with a lot of liquid lipstick so like if
I'm going to use this color I'll use
this in the center of my lips to give
that ombre look or I would just apply
this on top of a darker color so I'm
going to lighten it thus is kind of why
I use this one for but I love the
formula of this it's really nice and it
doesn't feel horrible on the lips and
you've just a dose of colors once as I
want to just talk about quickly about
the morphe palette I love this formula
actually I'm over it I never used to try
morphe that much because it's hard to
get in the UK I know you can get them
cold for you in the event of now but you
never used to be able to so I kind of
just never
ordered them because I didn't want to
buy from our focuses you know it's like
import taxing that crap so we never used
to do that but if they come to the UK
and luckily thankfully I'm so grateful
on a PR list now so I mean a party van
I'm sure I'm so you sent me
some of their publishers right and I
love them like this blush palette if the
9b I've been using this constantly for
eyeshadow and blush I put on today for
blush I use this color right here but
the brush stories are just really nice
if we will use this once it's a very way
to read for me it's way too orangey
right for me I just love these like I
just think that amazing the form is
really nice it's pretty inexpensive and
it bends very nicely it's inexpensive
and it's really good and then also I've
been using the morphe 35n palette I have
a lot of these items I have to say 505
to slate 5 om half the 55 OS I have the
35 P I have so many of the palettes on
success but this one is literally so
nice when using this one quite a lot as
well and yeah that is everything I think
okay I actually think that is everything
