just going to point out about my teeth
before someone else points it out I'm in
the process of getting veneers and these
are my temp receive at the moment and
they're very bulky so you don't receive
art exactly like what your real ones
gonna it like so so yeah bear with me
they look a little crazy but my feeling
at snatch to the guards in two weeks con
anyone that wants anything bad about it
go yourself I couldn't care less
it's my mouth not yours while you worry
why do you care goodbye so I'm just
going to carve out my brow this is the
NARS radiant creamy concealer in shade
custard you already know the drill and
then I just take my Sigma cream color
brush I thought actually went through
that carved out actually you might leave
it long lasting around so I mean I put
on that I read you can't I shouldn't
either
I'm just going to bring it down onto the
lid as well
where I shall obey okay so I'm going to
set that and we'll use my RT mi no color
powder
this is messy it gets everywhere
like I hate this packaging so much after
like I always just like pour a little
bit in the lid brush I'm using is bc for
my baked british precision so for
eyeshadow I'm ready to tiny little bit
what none we do so I normally take this
is like my favorite palette of all time
guys now it's the violet boss Holy Grail
palette it's my absolute go to it's one
part that will go everywhere of me
because I use it would be shade all the
time and love it
see I know atleast shade are you kissing
me
and apply this in the crease
no one's gotten wobbly today a bit me
soft break now I'm going to take this
online diffuse crease crease brush way
Sigma and which it is no flows in the
cream also if anyone actually want to
know about more the process of mint the
process of my teeth I am going to make a
youtube video about it I want to get my
actual ones so yeah once I get my final
result um I'm going to post the video
and you guys can answer questions us if
anyone is interested in it okay that is
actually what I'm going to do if I
shadow that's what I do a little bit
brown in the crease because - is why do
ya we always have time to do those
invites I love it so that's um like all
I do so I'm going to wing my liner and
I'm going to take my Sigma gel liner in
wicked and my cover effect often fusion
custom inches and drop and I'm going to
drop some of these drop I'm going to put
some of these into my eye line actually
make some more cream in it makes easier
to use sometimes your eye liner can dry
out and once you find it a wire will say
this is ready to go back to how it was
before you know okay a car we talked and
I do this because I'll it up so
sorry the reason why ego six we're going
to brush my Sigma this is actually
really good brush to define really easy
so for lashes and whinnies the Lily
lashes in opulence okay so why are my
eyelashes dry and we'll start on my face
so I'm going to make the primer I was a
day cream today I'm going to use this
animus biotech skin energizing day cream
as you can see I've used so much this I
wish you love this so much
it's quite expensive but it's like one
of my favorite day creams and see how
whenever I is first well smells like
that it's got a serum and a cream mixed
together so strange I can really dry but
temples and then I'm really is the
l'oreal infallible in flower level they
could know ok mattifying primer and i'm
going to use this to minimize my flaws
it's really good at that I'm just going
to find it in the center of my face and
then I am going to apply an eye cream as
well because my under eye has been a
little bit dry as well and Sabine is
quite a lot lately and this is the
origins ginseng refreshing eye cream my
eyes has been really fragile it is so I
mean I always use eye creams in way like
skincare routine and stuff but it's like
it just needs extra you know meantime
today
so for foundation this is my holy grail
foundation combination and the hourglass
stick foundation in shade golden pan and
with your a-slash in shade 400 so I like
to play this and then a small layer of
this on top and it just gives my skin
that really flawless look so I'm going
to start with the outlast stick
foundation apply this first of all and
then I'm wearing my 3d blender which is
by Sigma this is really really good I
actually prefer this to a beauty blender
now just I want to show the shape of it
it's really soft it's really good
already of it anything birthday by Ansel
C and I'm going to apply the duo as much
foundation on star
this next book concealer I'm going to
use the heart-shaped 8 in shade lighter
medium as any bring out find those click
rate videos so annoying like isn't a
video I think it's going to be like top
10 scary or approaches and then it's
like someone's shopping with an arm
slightly grandma like don't play me like
that it is the ones we are why are you
doing this to me I've come to watch 10
scary roller coasters and if you going
shopping with your grandma
they made a fun now look so good as well
and then watch hi goober that road
coaster like where they were up on that
front I remember what Rover is like it
so if you use my 3d blender and then see
how this 3d vendor is better because
it's like just shape triangle shapes
it's just easier to work my eyebrows as
well so I'm going to set that with my I
see ma no colors how old I this is a
really good paradox it isn't how many
such but and it's really good but I just
don't like the packaging so I'm next
going to take my Mac give me Sun to warm
up my face and I'm going to use this big
fan brush been using it lady from Sigma
D s 90
so I'm going to come to conserve water
comes I will use my anxiety webbing of
Kentucky and whites media and this is a
darker shade which I always used by
night I love it and the fan brush again
this fan buff work so well just gives
you that really burned alert and I will
see when you use a bronzer the focus and
it helps and to really blend out your
con so if you don't probably apply a
bronzer before and you go straight in
with concert sometimes it can be a bit
hard to blend that and I'm going to
highlight and of course of course of
course applause I'm going to use my
iconic London illuminated drops
these are back in stock guides I now
have three shades which is so good for
example and a light one and this one is
the original one and I've had this for
so long minimal Spencer I don't think
I'll ever use any other liquid highlight
this one is my absolute unreal favorite
and I'm really rooting for their brand
as well I love their brand they're a
small independent brand
the girls are so lovely that I own it
and work for it and I just only want to
support them in it and of their products
and so I wanted to tell here they like
me because she's light oriented things I
like something I'm like I don't like it
you know the owner is really lovely and
the girls are really loved did it work
from so I'm really rooting for that one
okay I'm just gonna and then I use the
top of that of course I'm going to take
my iconic London the shimmer palette and
I'm going to hit the high light and
illuminate shade I love this when I want
to re brought high like it's really
bright and I'm going to use my Anastasia
83 brush
my bottom lashes I prefer to use the
L'Oreal telescopic and it is really good
for what mashes it really separates mine
and make them look really long so so
lastly Phillips I'm going to take the
Anastasia Beverly Hills liquid lipstick
in Krush so luckily some blush so
Sebastian we'll take the two-faced and
sweet peach floating palette this module
blush is like my absolute favorite I
love the shade of it it's like almost a
little bit creamy buttery it's really
gorgeous so that is the finished look
this is like my absolute go to if I'm
going shopping going out for my friend
she's moving to town and every day look
that I always go to because it's like so
quick and easy sometimes I don't even do
the wings I know I just do the eyelashes
but for like the wing kind of just gives
me that extra bit of glam so yeah and I
also switch up the lip color sometimes
you guys see me and I've got like more
Brown lip and my absolute go to favorite
lip color which is like a brownie nude
is the Mac strips a lip liner and the
map peach stop lipstick that combination
is beautiful it's really nice brownie
new shade it's is gorgeous so yeah if
