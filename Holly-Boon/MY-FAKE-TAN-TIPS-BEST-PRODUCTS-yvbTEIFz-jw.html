mental about my fake town how I get
brown clothes of you always asking to do
this video and instead of actually
demonstrating how I do it I'm going to
talk you through it because I tried to
film myself to an energy it just weren't
happening it was not happening so I
thought I would just sit down and just
show you the products I use talk to you
about how I maintain my time what I use
elaborate you know you know this dress
by the way it's okay now those like
printed dresses
it's like mid-level it's from pretty
little things I'll link it but I want to
get it and also the choker is from
pretty little thing also some of these
glowing she went to get them the first
thing before I even apply any fake tan
so I will have a bath
normally soak for about an hour life I
can sometimes half an hour and then this
is really long but I have a buff and
then I have a shower so I soak in the
bath for right now well half an hour
whatever to present how much time I have
and then afterwards I think in the
shower and scrub so what I use to scrub
is they use the loving tan and this is a
correct exfoliate admit it's really wet
at the moment so just wouldn't go out
the shower but yes I used this to
exfoliate and then I use the skin truth
stimulating body scrub this is also
really really really really good I'll
link all these products below in case
you want to get them but yeah so I use
this exfoliating scrub and this mitt as
the loving turn off so easily with other
times I struggle to get off sometimes I
struggle to get off and other times I
find easy to scrub off I don't know what
that wire is it's just really
frustrating but yeah this loving turn
love gets off all my love in turn other
times no not so much after scrub harder
which is really nice see ya first things
first
exfoliate and then I'll shave as well
after I've shaved and go out of the bath
and the shower whatever I then
moisturize so I use the hemp triple
moisturize I'll link it below I don't
actually have with metal over but it's
like a really thick cream in moisturizer
so I will apply that all over my body
after avec so
get it and then I will leave my skin
alone for about two three hours
sometimes I was leavin til the end of
the day there are towns where I go to
bed but if I want to turn that day I'll
just wait a couple of hours and then
apply time because if you sometimes when
you mix tans and after you voiced your
eyes it can go like green color so if
you guys ever like had that happen to
you where you put towel and it goes
green it's because the times mixing with
your moisturizer and it just won't work
so make sure you wait until the
moisturizers really sunk in your skin
and then wait a few hours and then apply
the satin sometimes white next day or
wait for the end of the day yes and then
the fake town that I like to use I have
two that I like to use one is from
Australia which is annoying which is the
loving town so I have been using this
now for about a year I can't even tell
you I love it so much you guys know that
I love this because I literally go on
about this all the time and I've used as
consignee right a year now so I use the
two hour Express deluxe bronzing mousse
I leave this on for about eight hours
and only sleep in it or if I do it at
the start of the day I wash off at the
end of the day and yeah you want to
leave on for like eight hours and then
wash the top layer off and it's nice and
golden brown it doesn't go orange which
is what I love about it and also it's
very long-lasting this is not the
longest lasting time I've ever used I've
used a lot of times and this one just
lasts so long I can't even tell you
so well as it stands I only have to do
my channel at once a week once every
seven days I have to scrub it up and do
it again and I find it very easy to get
this town off as well which is good so I
hate having to scrub and scrub and scrub
and scrub I find that really and we're
in it it's obviously not good for your
skin and wear this one I soaked scrub
and it all comes off so it comes off so
easily so that's number reason why I
love this town
it does stink of fake tan like there's
no fake tile out there it doesn't stink
the fake tan they want smell nice when
you put them on and then once they're
dry they all think so yeah just think
the same time but it does it does quick
dry and it is nice olive brown color
it's not so orange so if you want to
spend extra money then order this from
Australia because it
is a game changer I'm not the one that I
do like I don't have it on me now so I
haven't been used it in so many months
but it's a sense repaid dark bronzing
mousse I love that times are I think
that is such a nice color it comes up
nice and golden brown but the only
problem with it on me it goes back to
you after a couple of days and I find it
impossible to rub it off slight I find
it really difficult so I just stay away
from it and use this yeah also sometimes
when I applied it and I want to be
really dark I like to use this white to
brown a fake time tanning mist on top
you can actually use this on its own
I've never actually use this on its own
but it's so brown and gorgeous and I can
put it on now like I sprayed it this
morning this one it's so nice
this one is from the UK hang it from the
UK it just depends if you want to use a
mousse or a spray the problem with the
spray is they run out a lot quicker
obviously and but this is another really
really good time I love this I use this
on top of this I've never used on his
own but you could use on its own to read
up it's fast drying it dries really
quickly and you usually again these on
for eight hours and then wash it off I
thought this one is more like a spray
tan in a can so if you want that real
nice spray turn this is like for you but
again it's going to run out real quick
so dust anything Lindsay so you guys
another one that I like as well is
called tan truth which is another spray
I'll link it below it's really dark
really dark brown it's so nice as well
again a nice Brown the orange these are
the times I recommend if you want it
nice and golden and not orange these are
really good so white to brown just was
in the UK can get it hold of it really
easily I'll link it below and this one
isn't alone because it's from Australia
but if you want to spend extra money
this one is worth it I promise you just
get a couple of these in the last use
for ages that one of these last mirror
and I tell and constantly write I plan
every week and then one of these will
last me like a couple of months you feel
like it's empty and then you just keep
coming out like so good and it's an MIT
that I use I was using the Lovington
mitt but mine might have leaked inside
my met one of
my tan innit so I had to buy different
ons I just got this one from Sienna
which is like this exactly the same as
the love in town one it's like soft on
both sides I've heard this one works a
lot better than those normal myths these
ones are more like a deluxe mitt but
these ones work a lot better for me
personally than the other one so for
face tan I like to use the bronzing face
gel by tan truth this is so dark and so
nice it comes like a clear gel and then
you apply it and then you leave it for a
couple of hours and it goes nice and
round like bronze and then also like I
said they do a spray can like this in
this make and it's really really good as
well look really good three nice and
round
real nice fast drying and no your
problem with these spray tans because
they are basically spray tan in a can I
feel like I find it difficult to get
them off
I don't have actually found any fake tan
removers actually work for me I find
them quite difficult to get off but
apart from that I love them I love the
color also I just want to talk about so
after that right I leave them for like
eight nine hours and I wash it off when
you have a shower and wash it off try
and have a cold shower not a hot shower
because if you have a hot shower
obviously opens your pores and a lot of
the time will come off then you'll get
out of the shower and on mobilize while
I put it on I've been really dark I've
had a shower come out and I'm basically
back to the color I was you just let you
want to rinse off that top layer you
don't want to take a weekend off so try
and just have like either like a not :
rocker system not a hot shower and
you'll notice the difference like I
notice a difference straightaway when I
started doing it when you get out when
you get out the shower I like you'll be
the same color as what you were when you
went in instead of coming out really
white like that is so frustrating is it
when you've just had on Bay hours you
wash it off then you come out and you're
like literally back to recited so make
sure you try to have a cold shower
because that works like so well also
make sure to maintain your tan stuff
from there patchy and go and all that
horrible and scaly I monster eyes
everything will go over my tongue if I
don't it won't last very long so I
always moisturize
over my town and I use that triple
moisturize I said before I just live by
that just thick and creamy and it just
does wonders so you need to make sure
that you are moisturizing on top another
thing I would say is do not lay a town
on top of councils tan habit and spray
tan and then after week scrub it off and
start again because when you keep can
talent and time you get town build-up
but it just goes horrible and it will
just will not go online so just make
sure you are scrubbing off and do it
again and not just put in town on top of
channels all the time
right when you go on a night out and you
want that glowy bronzed you know what
they leave your legs to speak glow in
allows you grows always ask me how I did
it as two things I like to do so
sometimes I use this which is a bronze
shimmer luminous cream it's like a satin
finish natural glow in shape dark and
this is from loving tan in the other
town of use dark or ultras are much
difference in both of them to be honest
I didn't see it not much of a difference
why just use whichever one since I like
to put this one down the Front's of my
legs on my shoulders and then just on
here as when I ran out no areas will
look really glowy and bronzed and this
is one thing that you can use another
thing that you can use if you don't want
to order that from Australia I perfectly
understand it's so long it takes ages to
go I'm not gonna like get this dog body
oil from boots I'll link it below it's
like three three pounds I think is and
what I'll do is it's like it's like a
little bit can but not really and I'll
rub down the pants on my legs again on
here and on here and then I'll set it
with a highlight so I'll just take like
my Anastasia Beverly Hills highlight
palette and then yeah put it on the
Front's of my legs my shoulders and then
this bone here and that's how I get a
really girly look when I go out and
night out so if you don't want to order
that from Australia though to boot sink
it right anyway but its staff body oil
put that down the front of your legs
down on your shoulders here and this bit
here and you look like JLo you will be
glow win and then all I do is just put a
bit of highlight on top like a bronzy
highlight a darker highlight and it just
looks phenomenal your legs look insane
I feel like I've just spoke a thousand
miles per hour but my camera battery is
about to die which I don't even know why
because I fully charged it so don't piss
me off
top tips are don't lay a towel on top of
tan moisturize and make sure you have a
coldest shower when you're going to wash
it off after eight hours so it doesn't
take all the time off and that way you
stay nice and dark and yeah I'll link
all of these products below these are my
I've been using fake time since I was
like 14 no type of a time 2014 so I have
tried everything you can imagine I've
tried fake bake I've tried Bondi sounds
I've tried San Tropez I've tried so many
cni loads of different talents and these
are my by far my absolute favourites
what I do with this is well actually a
faithful and layering challenge on the
town but I did this one I did blog in
town about three days ago and today I
just wanted to be a little bit darker
had a mine it had my time kind of on
patchy or anything it wasn't coming off
by somebody a little bit darker story
initially just sprayed this one on top
just to get back to being dark again
because sometimes after a few days it
just gets a bit lighter doesn't it but
yeah so that is literally what I do guys
and that is what I use so yeah I hope
you guys enjoyed this video but you're
like thanks for finally sharing what you
do with us also when you apply it
oh another thing when you get out of the
shower don't rub yourself dry so make
sure you pat yourself dry because if
you're rubbing yourself dry you're going
to disturb batalla knees hands gonna go
horrible so whenever I get out of the
shower I just kind of like pat myself
dry or air dry a little bit
I don't rub myself dry don't want to do
that just don't ever do that because it
just it would ruin your time yeah that's
another thing make sure to pat yourself
- right there yeah that's fiction sin
that I did so if you guys enjoyed this
