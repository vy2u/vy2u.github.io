channel my name is Holly Breen if you're
brand new here nice to meet you nice to
meet you
so I have teamed up with PMD today to
create this video for you guys well to
them a couple times before and I've
always been really impressed this
product it's been in my skincare routine
it's about September last year I don't
even use it all the time
I normally come at once a month when I
want like a really extreme exfoliation I
tend to use this and it works really
really well for me so I'm finishing it
with you so this is a device it's called
and PMD is a personal microdermabrasion
tool so you can do microdermabrasion in
the comfort of your own home which I
love because I've had my adem abrasion
done before in clinic I went about two
years ago when I kept something really
bad breakouts I think it was about 150
pounds one treatment so into this this
person is a specialist it to be honest
it was amazing it gave me like a whole
fresh I thought I've had a fresh start
you know I mean I but I kind of brand
new skin it was it was amazing I loved
it so much so when these this company
reached out to me in September last year
about trying this product I was like
hell yes hell yes like I said a date
uses all the time I went through a phase
of using it all the time but I don't
feel like you should use all the time
it's a very abrasive treatment
it really does remove the top layer of
your skin that honestly it's very yeah I
have it on the lowest setting because
I'm going for pissing by I'm a I
can't deal with playing so I have it on
the lowest set in because basically you
get these little things these are things
you get loads of different ones and
depends on how abrasive you want the
treatment to be there's loads of
different colors I always have it on the
lowest one because like I said I'm
autistic yeah so I think you just once a
month when I feel like you know I need
that little bit of extra brand new skin
calm the through so also this is
amazing for done if anybody else gets
this or officious me but I produce quite
a lot of oil in this area here and I get
tiny little black heads in this little
dent here I feel like it's where my lips
it's and one chin since that I get I've
got an indent there so I get a lot of
like little blackheads and then I find
it really hard to get rid of them like I
struggled for years on how to get in
actually get rid of those little
blackheads like you should just pick
them
the time and then used to give me more I
could get whiteheads and I thought it's
just a noise I started using it I'm
getting right in there right in there
and it just helps me so much it honestly
clears it out makes it smooth so when I
apply my makeup I don't get a little
bumps which is perfect that's what I
needed you know also it's really good I
feel like in my pores sometimes like
once a month for like resting to make
sure I've got everything out of my pores
like want to see cleansing and tone and
moisturize and every single day is good
it's going to get most of it out but
there's always that a little bit in
there that you probably don't you don't
realize that you actually don't you can
get out so I like to go in here again my
pores and just remove everything and it
just leaves my face so smooth so smooth
I'll do it in two hours as well but I
mainly try to focus it on this area here
where I get a little blackheads and then
in my pores here it's really really good
for some oozing out the skin it gives
you a brand new layer of skin to make
sure precise brush I honestly just makes
me feel like I've just been born again
with primary skin this is basically it
or insert it a little demonstration to
this video so you guys can see exactly
how I use it
and but you want to make sure you use
this with dry skin so what I tend to do
is I will cleanse like normal do like a
double cleanse make sure I get
everything on my skin and then I'll dry
my skin so it's completely dry a
completely dry one make sure your faces
so I've got then I will use this tool
how I normally work and then afterwards
you want to wash your face because
you'll have those little bits of dead
skin on your fight leftover on your face
off you use it it's like honestly
because I faked on my face as well this
really gets rid of it as well that's a
good thing as well so if you're
struggling to get rid of fake tile in
your face this also works oh I can't get
my face down off as well so yeah I
always have a little bits of dead skin
left on my face so you want to make sure
you go and wash your face to get all of
that off obviously you can then either
toner afterwards sometimes I do some of
the don't and just friends if I've got
one in around or not you don't really
really need to time but you can if you
want and but make sure you get all that
dead skin off and then I will use a
moisturizer afterwards and then I'll pre
include my skin to sit like it sometimes
different in the morning I leave my skin
alive about an hour and then do my
makeup or I'll do it before I go to bed
it's definitely one of those practices
so much less than money like I point
you I know I've been wanting to do this
video but only because I love this
product and I'm honestly being so
serious right now with my face
I'm being serious you need this in your
life because I've had this in my if you
go back on my channel you will know I've
had this in my routine since September

did taking they're going to send me some

them and if I like them I'll let you
