down from a video about my teeth because
those of you have asked me so many
questions about them and it's just
easier to put all in one video so yeah
so I put the questions on my phone so
I'm going to go through them and answer
them these are like the most asked
questions so the first thing I want to
talk about is like where I went and the
process and stuff so I went to Harley
Street smile clinic which is obviously
on High Street in London and the reason
I went - is because of that they have
such an amazing reputation and I went
through the website and after order
before and afters and I was like in love
everyone's teeth on there so I was like
I need to go there there's also a guy in
the report I was going to go to who is
insane he's incredible with teeth as
well but suppose you live reports
collect five six hours away from me so
it's kind of annoying to keep going up
there backwards and forth so to get to
London stuff's a lot easier for me so I
just designed to read London and the
only problem when you go to London you
pet you do pay London prices which is a
lot more you pay I think you pay for
what you get at the end of the day and I
want you to make sure I paid a bit more
the exact result I wanted so that's why
I went there
and so the first thing I did was away
for a consultation and that's where they
take a picture of your current teeth and
then they will basically operate a
computer and they'll design your new ETF
so you can see what your annuity is
going to look like before you even get
them done which is like so cool so you
can make if you sit there and design
your teeth with the dentist and
basically tell them what what you're
looking for what you want
so I actually go - I didn't go there
thinking I went to get veneers
I just went to enhance my smile and even
it out because I had a very bad habit of
grinding my teeth but only on one side
of my mouth so my teeth on this side of
my mouth were getting shorter and my
teeth on this side were still the same
so these were getting short are these
the same it was looking really no it
started to denote scible in pictures and
stuff it was annoying me so I just
basically went there and said I want to
even out my smile and they basically
advised me the best thing to do was to
have a aqua veneers
so I was like a bit like scared because
I always think I always thought they had
to shave the teeth unfilled pegs and I
was like look at all of them to me but
they didn't do that so that was another
question that those who asked me was did
they shave your teeth all the way down I
think it depends on the person
but from my case he shaved them the
tiniest bit that when I saw them once
the vijaya goes like has even done he
said you know I mean like it wasn't
hardly noticeable so I was like reshot
because I always thought that you had to
have your TV shaved all the way down but
again I think it was depend on the
person if you've got Rick I quite I had
he did say to me though that my teeth
will reiterate that quite straight
before so it wasn't going to be that
hard to do so yeah I did have braces
when I was younger and I was like 13 14
have braces for two years because my
teeth were like these two were quite far
forward they were quite uneven so I did
have braces which he is and when a
vibration if I lost my teeth so much I
let you love them and then as the years
have gone on they start to move back and
then again I was grinding inside of my
mouth from DC forget you or any ones
weren't and it was just looking uneven
and I just I'm so obsessed with straight
teeth straight white teeth
I've always been obsessed with like I
have what my teeth since I can remember
which is so bad by the way but I just
love really I just love really good
teeth so anyway and und anyway so I went
there for my consultation that was the
first thing then the second appointment
was to get my temporary veneers so the
reason why you get yours everyone's is
purely because it gives you two weeks to
decide if you like them if we're going
to change anything before the lab make
sure you'll remove your actual fit is
because once you've had these ones for
on they ain't coming off basically so
you get you some proven ears for two
weeks and in that equipment you get to
choose the shade of white that you want
as well which is cool so I have my
temporary obviously for two weeks and at
first when I was on I thought they were
too big I was like really paranoid on
that come over I think they're too big
but he designed them to fit my
mouths because my teeth before were too
small for my mouth so he designed my
teeth slightly bigger so that it would
suit my mouth and it definitely suits my
mom off a lot more now but at the time
when I first got them my temporaries I
was like but it literally changes your
whole inside phase it changes you so
much so it is a very drastic change if
you're thinking about getting it on just
be aware anyway so what they did was
they injected me with anesthetic and
thrilled Emily elicited gun contouring
which is where they kind of like get rid
of some of your gold because I had quite
a lot of gum on my team so he basically
took away some of my gum which by the
way it doesn't hurt because don't fear
anything but it smells disgusting and he
was like right this is going to sting
like I'm shaving your gums so it's going
to smell like burden undid it made me
feel a bit sick well yes I have in the
mouth you having about competing arms
you can't see anything by is weird
because you can see what they're doing
you can kind of like you can hear these
drawers and stuff so it's a bit scary
but you don't do any pain it isn't hurt
yeah so you have that they drew the
teeth or whatever they did YouTube just
reshape them or if I don't know some
cases you might have your TV shave down
I don't know depends on the person but I
didn't do shaved over the front of my
teeth and then files and other tiny bit
I might get you the tiniest bit and then
put my temporary teeth on and yes so
what if I put my temporaries I was like
to does it he was so big but yeah I got
used to the Masters use and I really
like them so I basically had my
permanent ones exactly the same as my
temporaries except these are winning if
everyone's are a lot thicker these are
very thin porcelain that's what
announcing I was scared of is I didn't
want chunky teeth because I've seen a
lot of people the happen is I'm very
chunky
see so I stick do you know what I mean
and when you showing me these ones you
show me them looks loose in and they
feel just like normal teeth like this
very standard oats or thick wears on my
tempura teeth they felt really thick
because they are only initially a
temporary mold that goes over your teeth
to protect them and till you get your
real one you temporary ones for two
weeks you can decide if you like them or
not if you want to make
changes before you get your parent ones
and then yeah then I went back and got
my permanent ones but then we're good to
everyone's you don't get the shade that
you are you basically triumph they break
that you just match them to your natural
teeth and then you pick the shade on
that appointment so I picked number two
which is not the light not the brightest
shade but the one down my teeth are
really white before my teeth for only a
shade three
so I basically went up one shade for my
natural teeth color so it's enough
number two number one there's a huge the
drastic change between number two and
number one like this is number two and
they're very white and number one is
like hello white like number one is got
a blue tinge and it's very false looking
and that's not what I want here like I
still always and we've really straight
nice teeth but I do want them to be like
in your face it's not make sense so I
didn't go for number one which is the
brightest shade of work for number two
did it hurt no I didn't hurt because you
don't see anything to your whole mouth
is numb so you don't feel anything but
it's a weird it's weird Malika temporary
teeth off because it's like grizzly
crack it sounds like because I basically
pernari teeth out because that is
cracking noise and it makes you feel a
bit funny but I hate the dentist bone
and mine like I used to be scared of the
dentists because I had two teeth but
when I was younger I hated it when I got
my braces so I was like avoid get
veneers for the last sort of two three
years but I've been putting off just
because I'm pretty scared as a nurse but
when I went there for my consultation I
felt so comfortable and made me feel
really comfortable and not that scared
I was shaking though in my eyes shaking
in the dentist's chair when they were
putting in a second and well I think off
the worst part is being injected with
that because if you're not very good
with needles needles are quite long and
when using jected my garden here like
almost like and I could feel the needle
like my nose but it was that long it was
like that I can see that it was very
painful
yeah that was quite painful but then
once your mouth numbed it's all good you
can't fit anything for the cost this is
a massive thing that was asked me is the
cost how much did it cost
so I pay a hundred and fifty pound per
tooth but they had a deal on than I won
so
they do have gills on every now and then
and see I got a good deal because I
basically weapon of the deal is off
and yeah that is obviously very
expensive but I have one with you son
for years so you know I saved it's all
good that is a thing all the questions
there wasn't that many so yeah they
didn't shave my teeth down but then
again I diagnose it depends on the
person so I don't renew I don't know if
you've got with your tree but even my
cubby to shave down I don't Reno anyway
mine I didn't get shaved down that much
like the tiniest bit it was even that as
well
it doesn't hurt because you get an assay
citizen herbie is very strange and also
ladies were asked me if it was needed
friends and normal teeth and it doesn't
honestly it doesn't I don't feel like
I've got veneers that is for like a foot
not like normal teeth and also they are
individual by the way they're not just
one big block when you get your son
received is one big block which is part
of your teeth it's quite chunky whereas
these are like individuals so you can of
the philosopher teeth and everything
that you normally do so yes you can't
whiten them those who ask me you can't
lighten your veneers yes I didn't get my
bottom teeth done because they're
actually quite straight anyway and he
basically just like filed the tops of
those they were all the same them and my
want seems were always going fine
they've never been that bad and I've
never really cared about those also you
have we seen them anyways so so yeah I
think that is everything guys so if you
have any more questions let me know
sweet me or comment below and I'll
answer them but I hope you guys enjoyed
this and yeah I like to be good why did
you get them down and they were fine
before I didn't like them before I just
didn't like them we are going to get
them done make sure you re rethink buy
it before you do it fits very dramatic
change it changes your whole face it's
honestly a bit crazy like I didn't
expect it to be that different I love it
now about at first I was like I fed up a
lot massive teeth because I had some all
the people fall but you get used to it
and I love mine now but yeah just make
sure you really think right before we do
I think nice everything I hope you guys
