perfecting primer this is my favorite
primer and I pretty much use it all the
time I am using blue contact lenses for
this look I'm just because I think it
expect with blue eyes and I will tag the
company below so I'm just using the NARS
sheer glow foundation mixed with my Mac
Studio Fix fluid and this is my favorite
combination foundation at the moment and
then I'm just using my Real Techniques
expert face brush to blend this in
I just realized that I definitely
applied way too much to my face and a
little bit goes a long way with this
foundation
so now I'm just taking my favorite
concealer at the moment which is the
NARS creamy concealer in shade custard
and I'm just using this to highlight
again I'm just blending that in with my
expert face brush by Real Techniques
so because my skin is quite oily today
I'm just um using my setting powder by
Mac I'm just to map this out a little
bit so I don't look so shiny next using
my Anastasia Beverly Hills cream contour
kit I'm just using shade cinnamon to
contour areas of my face and then I'm
just going to blend this in with my
Beauty Blender
also I did actually do my eyebrows
before I started videoing and because I
just thought it would save a bit of time
if we do want to find out how I did get
this eyebrow look then there is an
eyebrow tutorial on my channel
now just to set my contour I'm just
using the power diversion and shade
cinnamon again and this is just a Real
Techniques blush brush
now just taking the NARS concealer again
I'm just using this under my eyebrow to
highlight my brow bone and also just to
neaten up my eyebrows
now I'm just taking some sellotape and
I'm just sticking this across my eye to
make sure that my eyeshadow looks really
neat
and now I'm just priming my eyes with
the Mac Paint Pot embarr study
you
next I'm just taking the 17 shimmer
brick this is a drugstore product so you
can get this in Boots it was actually
like three pounds and so I'm just taking
the second from darkest shade and my
blending brush and I'm just blending
this into my crease and up to my brow
bone then I'm just going to take the
darkest shade and I'm just going to use
this in the outer corner of my eye and
then halfway across my crease
so just bending that out now or just
said that line isn't so sharp
so now I'm just using that darker shade
from that 17 shimmer brick and I'm just
using that under my eye
next to highlight I'm using my favorite
naked illuminated highlighter just
highlighting my cheekbones a little bit
on my chin a little bit on my nose a
little bit on my forehead and then I am
just going to highlight my brow bone as
well
next I'm just applying some mascara to
my natural lashes just before I apply my
false eyelashes
you
see if you guys already watched my
videos you'll know that these are my
favorite eyelashes ever and these are
the long lash from sorrow UK I will link
them below for you
so now I'm just taking the foundation
off my lips and then I'm going to use
lasting sensation lip liner by Mac and
just to line my lips and fill them in is
a really nice ready oranjee summer shade
it broke so I had to resharpen it over
yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial and next I am just going to set
my face with the mac fix+ and that's the
finished look and I hope you guys like
it
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
