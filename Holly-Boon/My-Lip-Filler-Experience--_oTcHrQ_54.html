talk through video all about my lips and
what I would recommend if you're going
to get them done and my experience so if
you want to find out about my lips then
keep watching so the first thing I would
recommend if you're going to get your
lips done is to make sure that you do a
lot of research and you know exactly
what product is going into your body
and because at the end of the day you
need to know if you're allergic to
anything we need to sort of understand
all the different types of filler that
are available and what's going to be
best for yourself on what you would
prefer and there's a lot of lipids that
are more hard as you lips feel more hard
or you can get the softer filler which
feels like you don't really have
anything your lips which is what I get
and but it's obviously all down to
personal preference and what you would
prefer so I would say number one make
sure you do those loads of research and
of course if you are allergic to any
sort of ingredients that are in the
product then do not do it
people just go in having no idea about
lip fillers and not having no idea what
ingredients are in them or whatsoever
and just go and get them done and then
have allergic reactions and things like
that so you really really really do need
to do your research - I would say if you
are younger than probably 20 years old I
wouldn't recommend doing it your body is
still developing and it's pretty much
the best thing to do at that age I know
when I was younger I used to think i'ma
go and I gotta get a bootable meeting at
a massive and like if I had the money or
if I could have got them done back then
I would have done it and I would have
just regretted it now and because I
think when you're young you just used
wanna fit in and you just want to try
all this crazy stuff so doing and I
wouldn't do it at a young age I just
wait till you're 20 and or above and
your body's fully developed and and you
thought about it more and you know
exactly what you think I would say if
you are first of first ever having your
lips done then I wouldn't go and get one
meal straight away if you've got quite
small lips because you don't want to go
from really small lips for massive lips
and because obviously you're not going
to be used to it and you're going to
think I'm my garlic rosy so I would
start off with a little bit and then get
a little bit more from a little bit more
and up there's the fur
that I went I got no point five mils and
then the second time I got one mil and
I'm really happy with the size of my
lips now I wouldn't get them any bigger
or anything like that because my top of
my lip here is quite close to the end of
my nose and was obviously if I had a big
top lip like Alex you would have no
space here but I definitely don't go in
go don't go crazy and go and get like
massive lip straightaway and definitely
try a little bit and then see how you
get on and if you want more you can get
more because as well if you go really
big straightaway you don't like it again
you have to pay to get it removed or
you're gonna have to just deal with it
until it's gone and but yeah definitely
start with a small bit first I would
definitely recommend that okay if a
celebrity's got someone on so you're
going to know they're really good and we
need to go somewhere that it's got a
good reputation if you just go to
somewhere that's cheap your arms
something after this changeup you pay
for what you get at the end of the day
and if you're praying for something
that's really really cheap obviously
your lips are going to just look
horrendous as well I see so many
Instagram pages of go and these lip
pages and the lips are just horrendous
on there and these young girls are just
like oh yeah and I just want to get big
lips like I don't care or and then their
lips just that I'm not in pushed to the
face or so ever ever and they just look
crazy so you have to be so so careful
and the person that I go to her name is
no fee and you can follow her on
instagram at jus nodes or aesthetics she
is amazing and I probably won't go to
anyone else she's based in Cheshire
Wilmslow Cheshire and she is amazing
she's all about two of the natural look
like trying to make you look as natural
as possible obviously sometimes it is
going to be obvious and in my case I
don't genuinely think mine is that
obvious I mean from the side mine aren't
really dark or anything like that and
she is lovely and also she is a koala
filly fully qualified nurse so I trust
her with everything and she really is
the best lit person in my opinion and no
I'm not sponsored by her shouldn't give
me free lip photos or anything like that
so I'm not just saying it because I get
free lip fillers because that'd be
really get it but there'd buy down and
be at she's
good also she is affordable she makes
herself audible so that young girls
don't go crazy and go to these people
that are really cheap so I honestly
cannot recommend her enough a lot of you
also asked me does it hurt and I would
say I'm not the best person when it
comes to pain I say I'm not like really
bad neck I'm so pain but I'm not also
that pretty good with it I'm I'd say I'm
sort of like middle ish and we do get
Naaman cream which numbs your lips and
you literally can't feel them at all and
also the lip filler does have numbing in
it as well the only thing that I hate
and I find it quite painful is when the
needle goes in and from different angles
obviously the needle goes in here and
then here and then here and here and I
find that quite painful when the needle
goes in and also you have to understand
that you are going to get sort of
bruising or swelling afterwards so and
yes prepare for that as well I had quite
a lot of bruising I'd say that in here
it was quite black and I had part not
breathing but I was okay with it so I
sort of expected it also you can't wear
anything on your lips and you lip
lipstick so anything at that for at
least 24 hours afterwards and but yeah
and also if you get swelling you have to
put ice on your lips afterwards just to
get rid of any any swelling help make it
go down um but yeah overall I would say
the pain is probably 5 out of 10 and for
me anyway um people might not find it
painful but okay so I pay around 250
pounds and which is really really not
expensive at all for what you get and a
lot of places in London and things like
that and are quite expensive that about
400 pounds for up one nail and which so
no fee is really good and I do like also
I am very open about what I've had done
so I've had my boobs done and my lips
done so open about it if I had anything
else on I would tell you guys I'm not a
secretive person if you want to know
that I'm gonna tell you and personally
I'm totally how do you think so
you 500 under and I'm going to say that
I've only done I'm not going to lie and
so all of you that are like oh because
she's got botched faces and so much
surgery no I haven't I've had my lips
done and that is it that is okay okay so
I would highly recommend that you go to
places and have consultations so you can
have free consultations and most places
which is where you sit down with the
nurse or whoever it is it's on your lips
and and you just discuss what is that
you're looking for what sort of shape
you're looking for because you can
actually change the shape of your lips
with filler and I am trying to sort of
push my more sort of like that rather
than because my lips sort of go at that
rather than that so I'm trying to do
that but yeah go to loads of
consultations and see who you feel you
can trust because is what about trusting
someone that's going to do something to
your face because you just have to trust
that person and also if you go anywhere
and they don't get you to fill out a
medical form then there's something
wrong okay because I've spoken to those
before I know but I'll have you to had
to have have you had to fill out a
medical form they're like no I'm like
that's so where that's so crazy because
you should be filling out a medical form
I fill out a medical form and the boiler
just run it she goes through then sees
if I have you know any sort of
conditions like heart conditions
anything like that that's gonna may have
a little is not going to help or it's
going to make things worse and obviously
she wouldn't do it and they want to know
you like what you're allergic to and all
that sort of thing because it isn't like
a minor thing it's a major thing you're
putting a thing in you're putting in
your body so you need to go somewhere
that is really really good I can't even
stress that enough and you have to be
safe it's it's not something that you
can just be like yeah it's to get my
lips I'm going to say be safe and love
yourselves the way you are date forever
throughout you have to change yourself
or someone else do it for yourself if
you want to change you for yourselves
and do it but if someone else is telling
you to do it and you don't want to do it
don't do it okay I hope you guys enjoyed
