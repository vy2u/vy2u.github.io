Lancome perfecting primer and I've also
already done my eyebrows because I
started doing it then I was like I
should film this look if you want to
find out how we do my eyebrows and there
is a tutorial on my channel say the
foundation that I am using here is the
NARS sheer glow
I've also mixed it in with my Mac Studio
Fix fluid just because the NARS sheer
guy was a bit too light for my skin and
I am just applying this with my Beauty
Blender also I have just hand and so my
tan is like crazy dark
you
so now I'm just taking my NARS radiant
creamy concealer in shade custard I'm
just using this to highlight areas of my
face
so now I'm taking the expert face brush
by Real Techniques and I'm just using
this to blend this in
you
so now I'm just taking my Anastasia
Beverly Hills cream contour kit and I'm
just using shade cinnamon to contour
areas of my face
so now I am just taking my beauty
blender to blend this in my do prefer to
bend it in with a Beauty Blender rather
than a brush and just because if you
press it into the skin it's going to
stay in the place that you put it
you
so now I am just taking the contour kit
the power diversion and I'm just going
over the areas I have just contoured
with the cream just to set that in place
and the brush that I am using to do this
is the Real Techniques contour brush
now just to set my concealer I'm taking
shade banana in the anastasia beverly
hills contour kit and i'm using the
expert face brush
now just holler under my eyebrows I'm
taking shade banana out of the cream kit
and I'm just bending that in with my
finger
so now taking my Urban Decay Naked
illuminated highlighter I'm just going
to go crazy and highlight areas of my
face where the sunlight would naturally
hit a girl can never have too much
highlighter
so now because I want to go from of a
bronze look I am just taking and the
shade that I have used to contour with
the powder which is shade cinnamon I'm
just working this into the crease of my
eye and under my eye using my eye
blender brush
you
so now I'm just taking my Max Factor
masterpiece mascara and I'm just
applying some mascara before I apply my
eye lashes
you
now I'm just taking the long lash from
several UK my favorite eyelashes I will
tag them below and sorry I'm just
applying the glue below it to make sure
it's a little bit dry em and then
sticking it to my eye
now just to blend my natural eyelashes
in with the false eyelashes I'm just
adding a little bit more mascara
you
now I'm just taking the foundation off
my lips using a makeup wipe and I'm
applying Mac lip liner in saw it's sort
of a little bit darker than my natural
lip color so it is sort of my favorite
lip shade at the moment
you
you
you
so now finally just to set my face I'm
taking the mac fix+
and yeah that's the finished look so I
hope you like it and I'll see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
