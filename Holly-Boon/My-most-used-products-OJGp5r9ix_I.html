video because a lot of you asked me what
products I use on Instagram and instead
of me just aren't seeing obviously the
same question over and over I thought if
I just did a video it'd be a lot easier
for you guys and I'm not gonna go for it
everything that I use just because to be
here all day but I'll just go free like
my my favorite products
so yeah and so primer okay so I did use
the Revlon photo a beautiful photo
finish I think it's called photo finish
but yet it used to use that it's only 11
pounds it is really good I did really
like it but I just felt like I needed a
sort of change which try something new
so I did decide to try a high-end one
and so I just got the lac blanc whom I
know doing reset by those don't judge me
it's called la base pro perfecting
makeup primer and this is quite pricey
it's about I think it's 2,850 so it's
quite pricey but it is honestly amazing
like literally it's well free so if
you've got already skin this is quite
good for you if you want something matte
finish and I honestly love this I would
pay this price again and again and again
like bitch it's so good if you put it on
your skin it's so soft and so I'm
definitely glad that I got this it's
made in and also actually what I could
get this I decided to get the do offer
over your skin forever foundation and to
be honest I do like a full coverage
foundation I have got good skin but I do
like a full coverage just cuz I think it
makes me look I just think it makes me
look better and it gives a nice finish
and this isn't a full coverage as far as
I'm aware but anyway I thought I'll just
I need on eat up not full coverage just
flat every day but to be honest I don't
think this is worth the price I think it
was about
fingers about 30-something pounds I'm
not sure but I wouldn't I wouldn't get
this again I'm not a massive fan to be
honest and but yeah my favorite
foundation I literally use this
foundation for about two years now would
you like to switch my foundations up
because I think if your skin gets to use
to one it starts looking really bad like
I used to use a foundation all the time
and the skin was just like changing it
not the same up it was not looking the
same so how do you switch up every now
and then just obviously make sure the
skin stays nice but this is the mac
studio fix fluid and sweetheart because
I'm quite an but I do swear by this I
absolutely love it like it's always my
go-to foundation definitely out of any
of them this is I don't think I'll ever
stop buying this but yeah absolutely
love this and I'm going to try it to
walk along to do what for quite a lot
Oh Estee Lauder Double Wear have
actually run out of it at the moment I
need to get some more but I use that
foundation want to go out and lights out
I do like it because it does say like
stays nice all night I would have to
worry about topping off anything like
that but is sort of my foundation I use
when I go out I wouldn't use it for
everyday it's too thick it's not forget
your skin can't breathe a little bit
it's not reading everyday foundation but
it is good for when you're going out and
you want your makeup to be good and
obviously it does depend on what skin
you have I'll put combination skin and
if you've got all your skin dry skin I
won't recommend using it if you've got
dry skins it's quite heavy it works
alright oily skin but you're going to
want to get like oil-free prime I to put
on fast just
sometimes it can end up right so can you
get it out a bit patchy so yeah um okay
concealers I knew I literally change but
I can see this all the time I don't
really have a favorite I'm always just
try and do one so but my definitely my
favorite at the moment is the mac
prolongwear concealer this is definitely
my favorite at the moment I just I don't
know it's quite creamy blends quite 9
states you know guys in this game one
out is quite good coverage as well and
yeah definitely definitely do like this
and I also did get the pro conceal and
correct palette by Mac this is good it's
a bit used so don't judge me but I'll
just run out this one I'm not sure what
shade it is but I really like that um so
yeah I'm definitely gonna have to get
this again love this um eyebrows I hate
eyebrows and I'm always always always
always always use this product and I
would never change like I just I just
don't think I would ever change I have
six love it that works amazing on me so
I don't think I'll ever change
and I use the Anastasia of Beverly Hills
dip brow pomade in medium brown this is
just amazing
I literally I've had this for about this
pot this is Zac pot I've had this now
for about six months and it's virtually
full like you need to give me the
tiniest bit so it's only 15 pounds so it
should last you forever
see ya I absolutely love this um
eyelashes a lot of you aren't who
eyelashes I use okay I don't really
stick to one eyelash I change while
she's on time I just get whatever is in
the shop that I know suits my eye shape
and I do like it to start sort of like
shorter in and get longer at the ends I
do like quite long eyelashes as well but
obviously in one's eye shapes different
so different ones are going to suit
different people and I absolutely love
the
lashes they are based in America though
which is quite annoying and then he's
definitely spring to the UK I love them
I do use those lashes in LA which is the
human hair style lashes and Milan
they're my favorite absolute of them but
literally my going to lashes for every
single day pretty much in the week I'm
going out then I'll use the Lily lashes
but I'm going somewhere nice but every
day of the week so I'm going to wear for
whatever I'm doing my friends whatever I
do use the Ardell natural lashes in
number 105 I love these lashes so
amazing just put them on clips eyelash
glue oh my god absolutely love this Oh
Kate Salim system natural lash strip
lash adhesive okay this is amazing I've
had this now for about five six months
and it's still pretty much full it's
amazing my lashes done all day I swear
by it it's made it a mascara not really
probably about mascara because of where
eyelashes doesn't really bother me what
the scar areas so I do sort of just pick
up whatever but this one I do love this
it's called extreme black Volume Mascara
flash by Rimmel and it's only like four
pound 99 or by pound something like that
and I do love this see ya
okay my favorite lip find I've got about
100 bit liners I'm not going through
them all but my favorite lip liner is
definitely max by skip by night I pretty
much use this all the time
sometimes use a Mac stripped down lip
liner as well I do love that they're
sort of slightly different than Mac
stripped I'm sort of more Brown this has
got more sort of like pinky undertones I
do love this and brushes I use Real
Techniques brushes the best brushes I've
ever used probably wouldn't change them
do use use Mac brushes but I think
they're quite pricey
what they are the row techniques ones
are just as good so I just use them
um okay iodine up now I like to use gel
eyeliner with an angled brush because I
just think I do winged eyeliner quite a
lot and I think it looks better and it's
obviously it's a lot easier to use and
using like home one of those ones we
like dip it and it's got the brush this
definitely works a lot better so I use
Maybelline eye studio eyes to do lasting
drama gel liner um and this is so good I
love it I use it all the time
it's a tiny part there's not a lot in a
bit last you forever because you already
need the littlest bit so yeah that's
pretty much what I use
not really your eye shadow kind of girl
like I do try and do I hide it but my
broken it but um I don't I tell you what
the only eye shadows I really eat from
Bourjois I think that's how you say it
and they've got like the one for brown
eyes blue eyes did it will palette
things I haven't got it with me but um
they're pretty much the only eyes that
use um yeah I think I said I think
that's it but if I'm missing you for now
just comment below and I'll try to
answer your questions if you have any
more questions and we have think that's
everything
thanks guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
