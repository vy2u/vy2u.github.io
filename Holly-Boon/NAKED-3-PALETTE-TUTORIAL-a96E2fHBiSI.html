hey guys so today able to be former look
using the naked 3 palette those of you
requested to see this so I went out and
bought it the other day and yeah I don't
really know what I'm going to do yeah
I've got something sort of in my mind
that I want to do but we'll just see how
that goes
and so I've just on my eyebrows I use
the Elizabeth Arden brow pencil which
looks like this and I will do a tutorial
for you guys on how to get more of a
natural eye using this if you would like
and so let me know but first one will
deprive my eye using the Mac Paint Pot
in painterly which is really light pink
shade and I'm going to be using the
Sigma 3d HD kabuki brush
okay so now taking my tapered blending
brush by first phase I'm going to be
taking the shade limit which is this
shade right here that shape right there
it's going to be using that as my
transition color okay so now using the
brush that you get with the pallet I'm
going to reason this end here I'm going
to be using shade Luna I think it's gold
which is this shown here it's going to
apply this to the outer part of my eye
just like the outer corner and then like
into the crease and over as well
square that my store makes a song leader
then taking the bending mushrooms going
to blend that so there's no harsh line
there okay so now I'm going to take
shade factory which is this color here
going to do the same thing again I'm
just going to apply it to the outer part
of the eye and then just slightly in the
crease as well okay then taking the
blending brush again I'm just going to
bend that so there's no harsh line there
don't worry about all this mess here
we're going to clean that up
hey using that fat end of the brush
again I'm just going to spray some mac
fix+ on the brush and i'm going to apply
that shady factory again to the out box
I just wanted to be like slightly darker
again taking the bending brush just
going to bend that there just want to
make sure you blend all the time because
you don't want any harsh lines you want
also just blend together really nicely
so now with the other end of this brush
that you get with the pallet I'm going
to spray some mac fix+ again on this
brush I'm going to take shade fuzz which
is this shimmery pink shade here and
apply that all over the lid you
I mean you're going to take this about
halfway you just want to just put it out
a little bit at the end it just there's
no harsh line there just literally put
it out a tiny bit be main focus wants to
be this part of the eye spot now I'm
going to spray some mac fix+ on that
brush again and I'm going to be applying
this lighter shade Ridge called dust
which is this really nice shimmery light
pink hair and apply that just to the
inner just to the inner corner of my eye
I'm going to be using the winged liner
brush by Sigma and this is the eo6 brush
and I'm going to be using the Maybelline
gel liner excuse my fake tan of how bad
the hairs
okay so that liner seems to be really
dry so I'm just gonna grab a different
eyeliner okay so now I'm going to use
the Sigma gel liner in wicked she was
going to take this color here strange
and the face face eyes shading brush I'm
just going to apply this to my brow bone
so now I'm just going to replace them
the L'Oreal telescopic mascara
- and apply this to my lashes before I
apply some false ones okay so for lashes
I'm going to reason the demure London
flashes and these are in Albury so the
eyelash glue that you use is the salon
system natural lash adhesive
okay so now their drivers going to apply
some mascara just to bend wide in with
these false ones okay so now I'm going
to start my face makeup so for primer
I'm going to be using the Nivea from
empire shave balm because this is that
the only thing that I find works good to
the primer so yeah okay so for
foundation I'm going to be using the
Make Up For Ever HD foundation and the
Mac Studio Fix fluid I'm going to mix
these two together and because it she's
the only mix that actually matches my
fake tan
for my under eye I'm going to be using
the Becca brightening corrector and
because I have got quite dark circles
and this is the product I'm really
running out of this and it's such good
stuff okay so recently I've been going
for a really bright under a some really
like it
so the concealer I'm using is the ultra
HD by Makeup Forever and this is in y21
and this is really really light but I
just really like to have a bright on dry
at the moment I'm going to apply the
Maybelline fit me concealer as well
because um I don't want like all of it
to be that bright
okay so I'm going to be setting that
using the laura mercier translucent
setting powder as always it's my
favorite powder
so now into canto I'm going to be using
the hoola bronzer by benefit and this is
the contour brush by face face
now taking my Laura Mercier translucent
setting powder I'm just going to apply
some underwear contour just to clean it
all out from where under-eye I'm going
to be taking shade and new de Nino here
and the fierce face eye shading brush
I'm just going to apply that under my
eye and now just taking the L'Oreal
telescopic mascara I'm just going to
apply this to my bottom lashes I think
I'm just going to go over my bottom
lashes with that Makris coral that I
talked about in my whole video
okay so I think four bottom lashes is
Mac one is definitely my favorite so
we're gonna dust off this excess powder
okay now for highlighter I'm going to be
trying this new Laura Messier and it's
not no I mean like I just got it
yesterday I'm gonna try this shade mix
without shade and I'm using the lux high
low brush phase of either and I've just
wet it with some mac fix+
oh my god look at that
holy now taking the eye shading
brush by fierce face I'm just going to
spray some mac fix+ on that and using
the same two shades I'm just going to
apply this to my brow bone and the inner
corner of my eye lastly Phillips I think
I want to take the dose of colors does
its work it because this is my favorite
lip color at the moment and I think will
go really well with this so yeah
I hover over this highlighter but it's
so good okay so that is the finished
look I hope you guys enjoyed this
