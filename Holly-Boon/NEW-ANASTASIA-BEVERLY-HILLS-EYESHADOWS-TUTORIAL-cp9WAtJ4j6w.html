in so I'm going to take my morphe r-36
brush and I'm going to take the
Anastasio shadow in brick the shade
brick this brush is an ugly thing this
brushes for eyes it's really big and
fluffy
it works really well to find my
transition color just so big and fluffy
it's really easy so we're going to go
back and for the shade in the crease and
just above the crease okay so next I'm
going to take the shade realgar and I'm
going to take some of this on my Sigma
defuse screeches this is the e38 brush
I'm going to apply this in the crease
and then I'm just going to go back to
this big morphe our 36 brush does
anybody know and how I can get that
spotlight at the back me how these like
Fuji youtubers have that spotlight on
the backdrop everybody I really want
that button how you do it says if
anybody knows what light I need let you
gal know and then these shadows blend
out so easily I could take no time at
all so then I'm going to take this shade
love-letter again from unsalted Beverly
Hills and I'm going to take my morphe
m51 4 brush and I'm going to apply this
pink shade right in the crease
I'm tired baby why and then I'm gonna go
back in with the shade transition shade
which is the shade brick on this big
fluffy brush go over the buffer also I
really need to get a better lens like my
lens is not great and I don't know too
much about like special lenses and stuff
but I just want to make my videos so
much better and then I can't zoom all
the way in when I do my eye makeup
because it keeps going out of focus so
it is on what I thought because which is
weird but I don't know what does that I
think I just need a new lens to run it
so again if you know any good lenses
then please let me know I'm go claim I'm
looking for so funny because when I
first started to edit my videos I think
she had no clue what I was doing I
absolutely know I did and I feel like
I'm getting good at every prime myself
I'm like yes gone free with that
enjoy where's everybody going on holiday
this year
I booked it on holiday the other day and
me and Ty just to get away after my
birthday because I'm really busy like
around the battery so I can't go but
we're going to go like it was a week two
weeks after my birthday we're going to
go um we should just go in Sumy offer
and we say the me hotel had it's really
really nice so I'm just excited to get
away a few cocktails later son some
bougie pictures you know I probably got
that as well I mean Todd and definitely
blocked that and definitely so yeah
where are you guys off to anywhere nice
because Todd's lychee like my best
friend like when we go on holidays our
flight and when we spend time together
we just have the best time I really
should have such a laugh when we get
drunk together and stuff so I just yeah
I wish you love that about me and him
know had that before you just go away
like get drunk together we have such it
off and it's just so much fun
okay so then I'm going to take at this
shade of Venice which is this gorgeous
full of shadow it's like a blue so nice
when it is a my Mac 242 and I'm going to
over the dead I can't deal with the
shade so nice I was supposed to film and
the AL cosmetic support phase using
their products today but my delivery
didn't come so I'm fuming about that so
I had this delivery from under sizing
every year and I was like I want to do
that I will be doing that video that
will definitely be up probably Wednesday
yeah definitely be up Wednesday and then
I'm gonna go back to my pink shade go
back in the crease then I'm going to
take my glam crystals dazzling gel liner
this normal shade this is but it's like
a bluey turquoisey color and I'm going
to go over that some when it's been more
glittery I'm just gonna place on top
where I applied up well so now we're
going to go in with liner we're gonna
I'm going to use the Ingrid eyeliner at
77 damn I just ran out of my Sigma
Johanna which I'm worried about because
with this one
I love X it's really black but sometimes
it transfers on me where you do your
wing and it transfers onto your
eyeshadow so I don't know why does on me
I don't think it doesn't anyone else and
so I'm just going to use this instead
but my Sigma gel liner is my right or
 not and see how I'm going to use
my Sigma yo 6 when you're on a brush and
I don't know how I'm gonna film this
clip I'll get rid customer so sorry if
my focus but yeah gala needs to
concentrate do what sometimes I wish I
only had like one I let off to humans
they have like one eye in mid of our
face because then you would have to get
your eyebrows even you won't have to get
your winged liner even it would just be
like the struggle would just be let you
know would just be so much better we
just have one eye why do you
have to have to cool so in regards to my
