channel and hello hi if the new here my
name is Holly Boone so in today's video
I'm gonna be trying out some of the new
Primark news connections so I picked up
so much stuff on I cannot wait to try
the eyeshadow palette and B I got
eyeshadow palettes
I've got contour stuff body shimmer
highlights liquid lipsticks eyeliners
eyelashes just got a whole range of
stuff so I'm really excited to try it I
do think that this is supposed to be
like the kpw Beauty because I mean just
the packaging everything looks pretty
similar they also have this duo ended
brush which looks the same so you have
like a kabuki brush and their sponge on
one end which I know kcw had that the
first thing I wanna try it is this nude
eyeshadow palette this was only eight
pounds so you get 28 shadows in here for
8 pounds which is really good obviously
yes after my last Primark video I was
really shocked at how much I actually
liked the makeup so I region expected to
be that good okay so these ones look
like shimmers these ones here and then
these ones look like for your shadows I
did also pick up this metallic eye cream
which is like this was only 2 pound and
this is in the shade what shade is this
daydream and I really want to try this
so I'm just gonna see what colors
actually is when I open it so I can see
what should I try a 20 years so I just
put some of this metallic eyeshadow on
the back of my houses waited to see what
the shade was so it's just like this
really light pinky like silvery pink
love that okay so I'm gonna go with this
really light pink here I'm its fluffy
brush this fluffy brush is my Sigma e30
8 brush picks up on a lot of eyeshadow
as you can see I'm just gonna apply this
just above my crease we're not gonna
show up the best because it is a very
pale pink so I'm just taking this just
above the crease I did do my eyeshadow
base off camera I used my makeup
revision consider and define but I
definitely need to get an eyeshadow base
because I felt like an eyeshadow base
will just work so much better than using
an concealer what I'm gonna use this
darker pink right here
I'm gonna use the same brush that I just
use sialic it does pick up a lot of
shadow it's quite pigmented eyeshadow
considering the price just know it's
right in the crease a pink I showed it
forever so far I really like the shadows
the pigment is actually very good
considering this play is only a pound
quite shocked blends nicely any struggle
internet I'm just gonna keep building up
this pink because there was any darker
pinks in this palette so I'm just gonna
just build this one on I'm just doing
the exact same on this side
so bringing it all the way into the
inner corner and the other corner and
then I'm just tapping it back into that
really light pink shade and blend in the
edge I have got the top on by the way
it's like a gray cutoff top it'll it
shoot it so have not wearing anything
okay so I'm going to use this nude nudes
metallic eye cream and I'm going to use
my Sigma cream color brush I'm going to
cut my crease but I would have cut my
careers without using concealer I'm just
going to use this because it is very
creamy
and then I might actually put one of
those four shadows on top because I feel
like you preen to set this wow okay
Primark seems really nice it is maybe
too creamy to leave on its own I felt
like it just won't free weights stay
there so I'm gonna try and put something
on top like a foiled shade or something
to kind of say it in place what it is
I'm gonna put a field on top is where
you can have to be that silvery white
one in the corner here so I'm gonna put
that one on top and when you use the
Sigma cream kinda brush you get I've
just wipe there and I'm gonna I don't
think this is gonna pick up anything I
would say you have to dig your brush a
little bit hard on this whitish silver
color because it's not the most people
did but it still comes off you just have
to really swirl your brush in there
okay what I'm going to do next is take
that bright pink there on this brush and
blend the edge because obviously we
don't know line down the middle of the
eye it's likely go back was in fourth I
wish there was a darker pink in this
palette I could use oh wait oh my god I
do pick up another palette okay let me
just finish this fast I picked up this
palette as well which is the matte eye
shadow palette this is just all much say
this one's for pound there is this pack
ball shade here's more of a greyish
purple but I'm gonna try it on the outer
corner because I feel like it's just
still a little bit I don't know that's
what has some depth to the all around
when I apply it using a pencil brush
because I just want to keep it in this
small area here the outer corner of my
eye
these pencil brushes from iconic London
I always find darker shades in like
low-end palettes always not just not as
pigmented as the lighter shades I'm just
pressing this yeah into the outer corner
and I was into the crease with the outer
corner as well see I will send up purple
shade out of this all match palette is I
mean you can build it up you have to
just keep swearing your brush in it's
not the most people into Don's first you
know if first application you have to
put a few layers on and also it's good
on a little bit patchy I'd say I always
find that with the darker shades in
these lower and palettes I don't know
why that is okay instead of that white
that I was putting on the top I'm going
to use this one because it's way
creamier so I do pick up this matte eye
collection this is a map I cream
eyeliner pencil and precision applicator
so I'm going to try this for a winged
liner why not and this is in the color
girl code and the price of this was
three pound okay so you've got an angled
brush here which I'm guessing you use
for the gel and then this
probably the eyeliner so that's quite
nice and when you use that my bottom
waterline see that's pretty too
and I'm gonna use this shade for a wing
and probably not gonna use this brush
yes let's try with the butter I'll try
it with a brush it might be a bit
difficult because the brush I like a
really thin angled brush this is a
little bit too thick normally for me but
so this is what the cream liner looks
like I don't even smoke its gonna show
up it's quite lie actually I think it
will help to cover that purple bit that
went wrong so yeah we'll say that the
eyeliner brush is maybe a little bit too
thick for me he's still just work the
eyeliner is very creamy which is nice
it's not stiff I actually really like a
nude liner like I feel like this would
look really nice if you just had nothing
on your iron just had a nude liner I
think that looks so nice I'm gonna try
that one time actually looks really nice
I really like this oh my god okay we
line our licky snatched I wonder if it
will dry down that's the thing if not I
am gonna have to send it with an eye
shadow okay I'm just gonna clean up the
edge with some concealer to use my
concealer and define from makeup
revolution I really loved this eyeliner
I think that looks so nice
I thought I could just really adds to
that look and it's also disguised that
dark shadow that whenever patchy I'm
gonna take some black eyeliner this is
just my Maybelline one I'm a group this
is my top water iron
I'm gonna apply some mascara I'm gonna
use my bad gal vine benefit
then I did pick up some lashes from
Primark these are the so sue the last
years I met the owner of this brown
she's so sweet I met her like over a
year ago she's just so sweet I didn't
even know she had her eyelashes in park
so I was like oh my god I definitely
need some of these so picked up the
style New York Paris and Dubai I think
I'm gonna go for the style New York yeah
we're gonna go for the style New York
they look really fluffy and really nice
they're only five pounds each and they
look like they look like mink lashes but
they're obviously not make mushes let me
just measure this on my eye first is
check that okay yeah well this is so
nice
I'm gonna use my house of lashes eyelash
glue okay we're leaving my lashes alone
for a minute just dry down a little bit
I won't forget this time about will so
I'm gonna do my foundation concealer and
stuff normal because the news collection
didn't have like a foundation not even
of that but I'm gonna try this brush
with it so you've got like this sponge
and and this kabuki and and then also I
got two of these sponges as well which I
like me better so I'm just gonna go and
dump these and I'll be back okay so I'm
gonna apply a some of my glam glow
moisturizer this is the matte glow one I
love this moisturizer so much okay I'm
just gonna spray some of my Mac prep and
prime fix+ this is in the scent coconut
loves none of that it smells so good
okay so what I did is I just dumped
these two sponges and the sponge on the
end of this brush as well this brush
definitely feels softer than these ones
like these ones do feel quite hard so
for my foundation I'm gonna use my face
daily on a double where I've been
wearing this so much recently I
absolutely love there and when I just
take my finger and dot this around my
face they try this sponge first of all
and which comes in the pack of two which
by the way are only two pound and you
get two sponges that so when you go
I'm going to try this sponge first so
yeah it does feel really hard but I
always find that with cheapest one just
like apart from the Beautyblender with
the other ones I've tried are really
hard they do still work but they're just
not the nicest don't let it feel the
nicest on the skins you know I mean okay
I'm gonna try this little sponge here
and see if this is any better because
the other one is a bit too hard for me
okay this one is still quite hard okay
I'm not I'm not a fan of the sponge just
because it's very hard and I'm finding
it really hard to push it into my skin
because it cuts a little bit okay when I
stick my lashes on quickly before they
dry
I also did pick up some of these
tweezers they have a pack of two one or
more of that like square-shaped twins
and the other ones are more pointy so
I'm going to use these just to make sure
that my lashes are as close to my lash
line as possible because I don't have
long nails and it once I find it harder
to do it these tweezers will one pound
fifty and you get two two tweezers for
one-half fifty that's so good even a
super driver so we got one for AK of
fiber it's like a soft matte feel and
it's got nudes or a navy like I really
like them designer please no see I'm
just gonna use the tweezers just to
squeeze and get their lashes close to my
lash line as possible those dashes are
really nice aren't they I'm really
fluffy I did pick up this which has
highlight and contour stick and it
always hurts one of these little mini
brushes which is basically this one but
a mini version but I want you to get the
big one so I just think it's easier to
use and this was eight pounds okay this
is the cream highlight duo and you have
like I like to shade in a darker shade
so yeah that is a cream highlighter you
get to sort of consider shades and then
this is the cream contour duo so you get
to contour shows what I found really
strange about this is it only comes in
one shade I'd say one shade is a bit
more warm than one shade is a bit more
cool this is pretty gonna be too dark
for me about I'm gonna try it
well actually getting it is a brow
highlight okay same Agosti Stix I'm
going to try the contour side but
probably not the highlight so just
because the shades is that one is way
too light and the other one is way too
dark orange some reason so I'm not gonna
try that I'm gonna use my concern
defying from makeup revolution and then
I'll try the contour stick instead does
anybody find that these run out so fast
I feel like I know they're a full pound
but I don't you feel like they throw
them along the way up I mean I might be
wrong but but you know I mean I just
feel like they run out so fast I don't
know maybe I use a lot of concealer of
me wishes me I mean I do use a lot of
concealer okay so I'm gonna try this
sponge again I mean I did try that side
for foundation so I'm gonna use this
side for the concealer and see what
happens
okay I like this got a little point Lex
you can get right in your nose why your
nose which is good again this sponge is
quite a hard sponge but still just a job
still just a job fine I'm struggling to
get right up in like me and why I though
it's gonna try this little one that
comes in the kit because I feel like the
little one I'll be able to get closer up
to my eye yeah okay yeah the smaller one
is definitely easy I can get right in
there I don't understand why like lower
end brands can't make a soft sponge on
the beat event maybe the beat is just
some sort of secret thing you know okay
so we're just to try the cream contour
duo all right hands on my chin just
leave that conceal it you in there
I'm gonna go for the warmer side or if
you're gonna be too dark or just nice
are we gonna put a tiny bit I'm gonna
try this kabuki side of the brush okay I
feel like the Kabuki side is a little
bit rough as well not the softest but
again it does the job
okay so do you think the cream Kwanzaa
is okay do anything else to say is that
I don't know someone's only one shade
for everyone like I tried to look for
more shades and that was like the only
shade they had so that's like a one
shade so I'm going to do next is I'm
going to finish off my eye makeup so I'm
going to go back to this nude palette
and I'm gonna go for the lightest pink
shade first under the eye and then I'm
going to go for this pink shade here
then I'm gonna try this eyeliner in my
bottom waterline which is basically the
one that we used on the top but it comes
with this one as well which I absolutely
love they've got this because I love
pitting color in my bottom waterline as
well as upon the top today we're gonna
put this right in the waterline bring it
down slightly that liner is really
creamy I really like that I also like
the top for the wing I think I like so
bomb okay I'm not gonna do my bottom
Ascari hack so I'm gonna set my under
eye so I'm gonna just use my Laura
Mercier translucent powder under my eyes
I'm just using my regular beauty blender
for this picked up just nudes body
shimmer dust which looks amazing like in
the shop I was like oh my god it's so
good I also love the packaging for their
cycle of the nude
it's so nice you get a little poof poof
news a little poof but you know this
bracing on my brush with my mac fix+
and I'm gonna just dip in just gonna dip
in this tap off the excess yes
I'm just doing a tiny bit at a time
because I am a little bit scared I don't
want to apply too much in one guide you
know I'm in them brunette but this is so
nice oh my god I've got so much this was
this was four pounds I work I love this
and if it's time down the bridge of my
nose just above the brow keep this boat
it is a body shimmer so we're gonna put
everywhere okay I'm obsessed with this I
love this oh my god that on there oh
look at that oh we're going look at that
on the shoulder yes this is so nice and
when it's thanks to my that shimmer body
dust and I'm gonna put some of this
my inner corner this is my favorite
everything and the eyeliner and then one
garden shown bright like a diamond
do the brow bone
the lastly I've got some nude lipsticks
I got a matte liquid lip and lip liner
in the shade thrill-seeker I then got a
high shine lip gloss and lip liner in
the shade mesmerized and it also picked
up these four which is a matte and gloss
collection so this collection was six
pounds and this one was three pound and
this one mystery found so you can get
the individual lip liner and liquid
lipsticks for free powder or you can get
for the mattes and gloss is for six
pounds I reach out my which wonderful
two years to be honest I kind of want to
use this shimmery pink gloss because I
think it'll go really well with the eyes
but first I'm gonna use the lip liner
from this one which is the shade
mesmerize okay so it's really creamy I'm
gonna fill my lips and a little bit with
this I always set my lip by nerds
because it makes light especially if you
wear glass it kind of makes it last a
bit longer I want to use this high shine
look at this oh my god if it's picking
up on camera
it looks so nice it's gonna put some on
the back of my hand
look at it comes out quite gold but it
looks pink I'm I thought pink underneath
yeah
I'm gonna put this matte matte lip cream
underneath I don't know if this has a
shade on it this doesn't have a shade on
it but it's in the pack of four but I'm
gonna put this one underneath and this
is a matte lip cream mmm
it smells nice okay cute at first nice
it smells really nice as well
and then I want to go for this gloss on
top oh well I care I like it in the
center of the lip okay so last thing I'm
gonna do I'm gonna set my face with my
morphe sign spray
so that is the finished look I hope you
guys enjoyed this video I actually
really loved the way that this look came
out at first I was like I'm gonna don't
know but I absolutely loved it I think
it looks so good and the nudes eyeshadow
palette the lighter colors and really
pigmented really easy to blend say the
darkest shade that dark purple was hard
to blend and it was hard to get a
pigment like had to keep piling on and
piling on and then when I repent it
would kind of go a little bit patchy but
where I put that cream eyeliner on top
you can't see anyway I love the metallic
eye cream you just need to put a foiled
shadow on top just to kind of set it a
little bit because I thought if you just
leave it how it is it's kind of a slide
around that matte eyeshadow cream
absolutely like has actually dried down
really well so I actually didn't need to
put an eyeshadow on top at all it looks
really good and I absolutely loved that
I cannot wait to try this with no eye
makeup I really want to do that I love
this pencil as well for the waterline I
love that I absolutely love this body
shimmer I think that literally looks so
good I'm obsessed I love that and I love
this lip gloss instead of the lips I
will say with the Korean font I probably
won't use it again I'm just because the
shade was too dark for me but then even
when I printed it out I thought I can't
still looks fine I don't like it look so
dark if you are very light you're not
gonna be able to use the cream stick
because I think it's only one shade that
it comes in also in regards to the
sponges and the brushes the sponges for
me are too hard I personally like my
Beauty Blender so much more because it's
way soft on the skin I feel like it kind
of pushes in the products a lot easier
and these ones are a bit too hard but if
you are on a budget they do work they
definitely are worth or two pounds you
get two sponges for two pound which is
really really good they do still do the
job but if you do have the money I would
get the beer under because it is not I
started to work on the skin in regards
to this brush I know Prime I already
have some really good kabuki brushes so
I would just go for like a regular
prymaat kabuki brush rather than this I
just think this is okay I like that it's
got the points you can get right in
there and stuff but again it's quite
hard and it's quite obviously your under
eyes quite sensitive area so this being
quite hard is not the nicest use under
the eyes
and also like I said Primark are really
good kabuki brushes so I don't feel like
you need to get this they have better
ones in there that you can use yeah
overall I'm really impressed I think the
makeup came out really good I hope you
guys enjoyed this video make sure to
