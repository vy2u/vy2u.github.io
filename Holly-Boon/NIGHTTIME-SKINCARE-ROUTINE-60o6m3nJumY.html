around to doing this video this has been
highly requested for such a long time
now and I'm finally getting around to
filming it for you guys
so this is my night time skincare
routine I do this every single night
without fail like if you're going to
think this is a lot to do and but it's
really really good to get into the
retailer routine of doing it because it
just makes my skin I feel like it's
helped my skin a lot and it just makes
my skin feel amazing and I just can't
not do this every night now I have to do
this every night about fail so first
thing I do is I take my makeup off most
of my makeup with the Johnsons and
makeup be con pampering wipes that's the
first thing I do so I'm just going to
basically show you guys it's going to
take my makeup off so I did just film
this makeup I don't if it's going to be
up before this video or after it but it
will be up on the tunnel and so the
first thing I do is take a makeup wipe
and basically just like get rid of
majority of my makeup
okay so once I've removed most of my
makeup with a makeup wipe and they like
to take the Mac cleanse off oil and this
thing this little thingy my Bobby from
vanities planet Spa this is literally
just exfoliates your skin gets rid of
any dead skin also helps to make sure
you remove every single little bit of
makeup off your face this is just like
so good I highly highly recommend
getting these I know they're really
really expensive I've seen the Clinique
ones and a few others that are really
really expensive so this one is normally
125 dollars for this and you get two
different heads so you get one more of a
rough this is more to kind of like
exfoliate this one's kind of just and
just to kind of like help ensure that
you remove one of your makeup and then
also you get this other head here so you
get three different heads with this
it's normally one hundred and twenty
eight dollars and but I've they've given
me a website link I will link in the
description box below if you click on
that and you purchase this you get it
for $38 $38 instead of 128 and that's
for a limited time only so if you guys
want to get this then I highly recommend
get any ASAP because them is not for not
for a long long time so yeah so I'm
going to show you what how I use it so
I'm going to just apply some of the Mac
cleanser oil into my hands first I'm
just going to rub this basically over my
face
okay just once I've done that and then
take this you get two different set is
you've got a slow set in and a faster
and I choose the faster in and it's just
really nice just were like literally let
it do it don't push it into your skin
literally let it do its work
you think that you get all your makeup
off with a makeup wipe you do not I
promise you no you do not you really die
I'm just going to go over my face again
with makeup wipe just to get this oil
off my face so then I'm going to take
the Clinique take the day off balm and
I'm just going to apply some of this to
my skin and so it's like this and then
it melts like it's up a cream and then
it kind of melts into an oil once you
apply it into your face and if you've
got all these cannot me don't worry it
doesn't make you skin any more oily and
when I take this end instead which is
short on it's a little bit more rough
and again I'm going to use it on the
fastest there so then the last thing
that I like to do after I've cleanse my
skin twice I like to take this I said
it's tightening essence spray by a
temple Spa I'm obsessed with this stuff
and I just fix you spray this on my face
so yeah once I've literally cleanse my
skin twice I then spray that just really
put it into my skin I'm gonna die to me
dawn is my skincare routine
and I do that every single night so I
highly recommend doing that definitely
and try and get into the routine of it
because sneezer is into the routine of
it it doesn't take that long to do it
and it's just like so important to make
sure you remove every single bit of
makeup off your skin and I highly
recommend it and it you plan it
spark it and I will again put the link
in the description box from down from
one hundred and twenty eight dollars to
thirty eight dollars for a limited time
only with the link in the description
box I highly recommend it I've got
honesty you need one of these in your
life the Clinique ones go for about
three hundred pounds is other ones that
go for like so they're just so expensive
so I highly recommend getting near so
you get free to put heads and yeah I
hope you guys enjoyed this video
make sure you give a thumbs up if you
did and please subscribe if you haven't
already and please please please please
stop cleansing and tone your skin it's
so important honestly it's so important
if you've got a really fresh nice base
to work with that's when your foundation

routine of cleanses at home your skin
