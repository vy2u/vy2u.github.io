channel and hello welcome hi if you're
new here my name is Holly beard so in
today's video I'm gonna be showing you
my no makeup makeup look this is
something that I do when I just want to
freshen up a little bit but I don't know
where any makeup so I'm going to the gym
or if I'm just gonna quickly go to Tesco
and do some food shop or just whatever
if I'm just like in a rush then this is
what I do just to make myself look a bit
more awake so it's pretty gonna be the
shortest video ever because I read I do
that much but anyway um so the first
thing I'm going to do is my eyebrows so
I like to comb some brow gel through my
brows first of all I like to use the
anasazi Beverly Hills brow gel I do like
the pro mic one as well but for some
reason I can't find it anywhere but
definite you try the pro mic on because
it's really good whilst I leave my brow
hairs to dry down a little bit before I
put product in it I'm gonna do my face
so I like to apply some of the pixie
rose oil and all over my face this just
I really like it when it just soaks in
my skin it just feels pretty nice so
just put a couple of drops on the back
of my hand the skin I'm also gonna bring
it up under my eyes as well up my neck I
really really love this stuff it just
for so hydrating and it just looks
really nice on the skin then I'm gonna
go through my brows and just fill them
in a little bit I do love the skinny
brow pencil from Primark but I literally
just ran it out like there's none left
look I'm really nice oh but it's prom
and pick up more of them but in the
meantime I'm gonna use my NYX brow pen
so it's the same sort of thing and it's
in the shade black and I'm just gonna go
fill in my brows I'm just doing it
really lightly like I don't want to
apply too much product but just that I
don't have any sparse areas I don't want
to provide too much and then I just comb
it through if you hadn't already notice
I'm ready
vielen pink at the moment like pink
nails pink backdrop pinkish top I'm just
livin
okay so once I've done that I'm going to
go over it again with this brow gel okay
so next thing I like to do is take my
makeup revolution concealer and define
in the shade c5 and just put it signing
up with dots under my eyes so I'm going
to do one side and then not do the other
side so you can see the difference it
makes so I just put three little dots
like that make sure nothing crazy I'm
also going to put some over my spots so
then I'm just gonna take this finger and
I'm going to gently blend it in under my
eye
I just kind of like rub it in I don't
want too much product under my eyes
because I'm just doing a tiny bit of
makeup but I want to just cover some
cover the dark circles to make myself
look a bit more awake I want because I
put the oil onto the eyes when I put the
concealer on top it bends in really well
so you can see the difference this side
just from putting a tiny bit of
concealer just makes me look a lot more
awake so I'm going to do the same on
this side now so just three little dots
like that and just rub it in it's so
hard to get right in the corner when you
have long nails don't rub too hard just
Rob really gently you like you don't
want to hurt your under eye so once I've
done that I'm just gonna put some runs
are on so I'm gonna take my Mac coming
to rise skin finish in the shade dark
deep and a big fluffy brush and I'm just
gonna bronze up a little bit the outer
part of my face so we're not doing any
foundation I don't do foundation when I
don't want to wear much makeup I just
wanna look a bit awake I don't really
wear foundation and it's wish everyone
going to the gym I've known as the gym I
like to look like you know awake but I
don't want to Wow see a ton of makeup to
the gym I also do this makeup when I'm
on holiday and if it's really hot and
it's like you know the daytime I want to
look nice but I don't want to wear laser
makeup this is what I do as well so
after that this is something this is
I sometimes do I'm going to show you
anyway because I sometimes do it I
sometimes don't but I'm going to add it
in anyway I take my iconic guns and
illuminate it drops in the shade
original but tie it with drop on the
back of my hand again I'm gonna use my
finger for this and I'm just gonna press
this in just kind of rub it in really
just gives me an extra bit of like below
and it looks like a natural glow because
it's a liquid it's not a powder it just
kind of like really blends into the skin
really nicely you do the same then I'm
gonna take some mascara and I'm gonna
put a little bit of mascara on yeah
mascara doesn't really make the world of
difference because I have like the
tiniest little eyelashes but I like it
to put a little bit so it makes them
look black and not really like my crown
okay so then lastly all I do is I either
take a lip balm or a lip gloss maybe I
use a lip balm but I come from a lip
balm so I'm gonna just use gloss and I'm
just gonna put a tiny bit of gloss in
the middle like that hey again just use
my finger just as it makes my lips look
a bit more hydrating obviously I'd like
to use a spray these are my two
favorites this one's any empty no I've
had I've got for about five of these
this is the Mario Badescu facial spray
of a low cucumber and green tea and this
is the mac fix+ in this and lavender and
I love this one of this one I absolutely
love it
I have heard that Mario Badescu got a
lovin to spray out now though so I'm
definitely gonna buy that but I'm going
to spray my loving the one today because
I do love the smell of it this just
gives me so much hydration and it just
feels so nice so that is literally it
that's all I do I do my brows
and a little bit of concealer some
bronzer glow I'm not always glow but
sometimes I do got to see the glow it
specially the illuminator drops because
it literally looks like your skin is
just going because it's not a powder
it's just like a liquid so when you put
it on top of like just your skin it just
looks unbelievable it's my favorite ever
my favorite ever liquid go I've tried a
few little poodle eyes I just don't feel
like anything compares to it honestly I
love it so much
and yeah I love this rose or you're
using this for the longest time if you
guys want to follow me for a while you
know I absolutely love this and I
especially like to wear it when I'm not
going to wear foundation because if I
wear underneath foundation sometimes it
works nice and then sometimes it can
make my makeup not last very long so
like a little bit oily but when I'm not
wearing foundation I love to wear it
because it makes me look so so glowy and
just makes my skin feel really nice so
yeah that's literally all I do I'm sorry
that this is such a short video but if
you're someone that just wants a quick
makeup look just to make yourself look
more awake then this is perfect for you
and also like I said it's perfect for
holidays vacations is perfect for that I
hope you guys enjoyed this video make

in my next one bye everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
