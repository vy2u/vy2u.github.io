channel and hello hi and welcome to a
new year my name is fully Boone so in
today's video I'm gonna be doing the no
mirror makeup challenge and I'm late on
this I know this was that two years ago
like where you've been
I've started to do more challenge videos
on my channel because I mean three times
a week now so yeah I thought I'd just
throw a Chinese video in the weekly
upload and those of you guys we see this
so let's see what happens
I could be out of focus right now I
could be knows but yeah I say I'm
gonna first do my eyebrows like I always
did I'm gonna comb some brow gel through
my eyebrows too anyway because I know
where to look
then I'm going to use my NYX micro brow
pencil in the shade black to fill in my
brows okay where's the start of my
row
I was good I think where I was is
probably the hardest thing because it
was such a small area and eye shadow
right the face makeup should be okay oh
my god this is so hard
this is the weirdest thing even if I
know you to be you should definitely try
this because it's really weird you
should just try it for fun and see how
you makeup comes out I'm so late on
everything I literally I never used to
do tragic videos on my channel but you
guys seem to like them so kind of
security I don't know where to look Ava
it's shitty Wixom see I'm normally
looking more so I'm like where do I look
get on in
I'm gonna just kind of somewhat gel
through them so I'm gonna carve up my
brows this is gonna be so hard
I'm gonna carve up my browser when you
buy makeup everything can seem to find
in the shade c5 I really actually need
to get an eyeshadow base they used to
use the Mac soft like a Paint Pot but it
was too drying for my eyes it would read
wrong with it so if you've got really
oily lids I really recommend that one it
is quite good you need to try more of an
eyeshadow base because my throat sighs
with concealer and doesn't always work
the best I'm not God
this is funny no idea since I I
want to make sure the concealers like
bended in not like there's no lines just
trying to guess where my brow is but my
res is so uneven actually kind of wait
for it to start to be like woman where
for a more summery cuz there's windy so
many summer makeup looks I've got so
many in my mind that I want to do I want
to film but at the moment it's just like
the web as well she'll need to set my
lips the thing is with me not setting
when it and a lot of people will say
you'll get more pigment you do get more
people if you don't set your lips but
for some reason I think it's because I'm
using the wrong base I need to get
different base we don't accept my base a
if it's concealer it will slide around
and it just will not dry down I think
that the eye shadow will just look wet
so I definitely need to try a different
base to try that because concealer just
doesn't work in that situation I do want
to try the Peter with a shadow base
because I bet it's sick okay so
I've got the morphe 25 a palette for
many years so I'm gonna do a brown
smokey eye why not and I'm gonna use
this shade I'm gonna use this shade
first of all and this is on my Sigma e30
8 brush
okay I wanted to do the other side
love doing eyeshadow it's just so
relaxed today you know I just wanted to
say that exchange I just want to look I
just want to learn I want to see what
it's like I can't so annoying
okay I'm gonna take this shade right
here and I'm gonna put this all over the
lid and this is some morphe brush again
more he doesn't have a number in it I
don't know where they do that when they
put like when they put brush sets
together
you don't ever put the numbers on the
brushes it makes it read at home let me
tell you which one it is it's your
second flat flat brush when you Ray
Margie who tries to do a cut crease oh
my god okay I'm going to take the
partial I use for the other shade and
then and me your location eyes focus on
communication can I say and I don't want
in you I'm in love with the way you're
movin I think we should have a drink or
two truth is I wanna love with you so
come my way
dragging somebody so baby boy come my
way so I again II somebody cuz I can
give you what you need mmm-hmm oh my god
okay next thing I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna apply some gel liner along my lash
line not always there I'm gonna use mine
as we've our winged liner brush oh my
god
I'm gonna put this in my top waterline
wish me luck Oh God okay that was scary
okay I'm gonna apply some with the bud
gala bang on mascara from benefit scary
so mystic lashes on so I'll apply some
blush glue I'm choosing House of lashes
lash glue and of course I'm gonna wear
my Coco - is inside a more like what is
new I start on my face I'm going to see
that some moisturizer on my knees this
glam glow ball cosmic matte glow
moisturizer and I think it matte glow I
I know it doesn't make any sense Mina
but it's good you setting right arms
24/7 because I thought right I'll get up
really early in grade gym and I sneezed
it till I 9 o'clock and I was like I
hold her I used to fail so I'm gonna go
Jim they are me trying to get that
somebody would try it you know it's cry
and so for my foundation of money is the
double wear by Estee Lauder and
basically talk to you I was totally in
the other day and she had never tried
this and she tried it out and I used to
use this so much back in the day and I
probably like two years ago just over
two years ago I used to love this
foundation I would use it all the time
so I wanted to get it again and just see
like why I used to love it so much and I
wore it the other day and to go out as
well in London and I love it it's just
so very lucky those I'm quite a giri but
it dries down and I used to shade it
cashews I'm gonna use me for shade
reference but yeah I love it
I forgot how much I loved it but I think
the problem was I think the problem I
had with it before is if you use it too
much your skin gets a bit used to it and
doesn't sit as nice but when you haven't
used it in a while it's like oh it just
goes on so nice and it wears really
nicely
actually a good full coverage I find out
this face part is putting up here easier
than the eyes I hope God oh sweet
you say I really want to see my own a
part like wherever you want to look up
at looks so bad yeah its foundation I
wouldn't wear it but every day I just
keep it for like if you go now or every
now and then you know I mean it's not
something I'd wear every day also I
remember with this foundation is I used
to get a lot of flashback of it as well
if I go that's why I stopped doing it as
well like because of the SPF in it you
would get like so much rush back but if
you use like a powerless like my mac
studio fix powder NC 42 on top it's fine
I always say like when you put the
bronzer on her stuff when you put your
powder bronzer and stuff it should be
fun oh god this is the bits gonna be
hard going around my eyebrows this is
actually so hard it's like way harder
than I thought I know I like I knew it's
gonna be hard but it's just like you
just it's just an urge to look to see
what you didn't like I'm I can see that
I'm gonna use the revelation concerning
define and I'm gonna mix it with my deal
for every skin under cover concealer
because this one is slightly too light
and it doesn't cover my dark circles
completely I don't think like at first
like when my dark circles aren't too bad
I will just use this one it's fine
but I don't know you know where my dark
side bizarre a little bit worse it
doesn't really cover them but if it's in
the center my forehead
television my nose my chin and then yeah
my dear or under cover from the skin
this is in the shade that you want which
is a bit darker as well I'm gonna use my
Beauty Blender
again guess you just forgot about their
lashes me every time every time I always
forget that my eyelashes are just there
okay before I blend in the rest I'm
gonna stick my lashes on my goddamn
reason
I hate to think what it takes I don't
say I even feels wrong like so just know
in this Dick's Arriba because like just
when I stuck that latch on that is not
fair right I saw stick it ashes over
memory is probably the worst thing ever
I really have absolutely no idea I bet
that looks so bad even if it I get feels
like it's in the wrong place
oh my god okay so when I do cream runs
and X I'm going to use my NYX foundation
stick in the shade rich I've got fingers
like having white nails is that you get
makeup on them and it's just so annoying
okay so I'm going to blend it in with my
sponge god I hope it fits in the right
place
so what using a Beauty Blender is
literally an arm workout I don't care
what anyone says doing this on your face
like it hurts your arms so next time
someone says to you train arms or do you
workout do you say yes I do I use a
Beauty Blender and it really hurts well
my mom is Akins over that I really think
you guys to try this challenge even if
don't have eat you and just like take a
picture and tweet me excess honest a I
think it's so funny
I'm just gonna keep going over this with
the vendor because I just die when it's
not be blended in okay so I'm gonna use
some runs and X I'm gonna use my Mac
mineralize skinfinish in the shade dark
deep and this NYX fluffy brush in number
21 I'm just gonna put this over the top
of where that wait I haven't said
rounder I ever no panty set my under eye
so I'm gonna just grab it with a sponge
because it's probably crisper now and
I'm gonna use my Laura Mercier
translucent powder and you partly only
love my mom I'm sorry
yeah right sure there's a hat on my head
like a bit last night what that's real
right okay I'm gonna do blush I'm going
to use my benefit California why not God
there's definitely a higher somewhere
see my eye okay
so I'm gonna do highlight you can use my
I'm erasing on that from an associate
overhears anybody's my Sigma high
cheekbone highlight bra
I'm gonna put a tiny bit of this above
me bro I thought the face that stuff
even easier than the eyes and up normal
to speak - sings - put it up - hot mess
I read of it it's down the bridge of my
nose Shiva's bow now I'm going to get up
right on to the eye so I'm gonna take
that first shade on this fluffy brush
this is the hardest because I don't want
to get this in my eye
God you don't want to end up with I
should have in my eye is so painful now
I'm gonna use my this morphe brushes
that dark brown color don't think this
is the wrong brush for this okay now
going to bottom mascara okay this is
where it's pretty all gonna go from bad
to worse Gary
isn't it weird the mascara face Oh
everyone does it but like why I can't do
with my scarf out opening my mouth to do
it you me try
no fair all right okay next we're going
to do lips I'm going to use my mouth to
lip by night in the shade sweetie
when you use my dice of cards liquid
lipstick and they change supernatural
okay I flipped the lips I don't know
what just happened
and then buddies my morphe set in spray
not sure I probably want to set this
makeup I definitely probably don't okay
so I'm gonna go grab him around I'm
gonna see what I look like so I'll be
back in two seconds okay so I'm back
I've got a mirror
oh I let me get it too bad I'm actually
quite short my eyebrows oka hot mess
they look so bad I shall look bad that I
should looks really bad that I just
don't look that bad like I actually
thought that I'd stop the one like wonky
they actually don't act you guys are
there I'm my face maker I actually think
my face makeup was quite good you know I
mean this contour situation here like
that looks so bad I don't think I do too
bad I'm actually really shocked he's
really weird like when you're doing it
back mirror you think it's gonna be
horrendous like I really thought it was
