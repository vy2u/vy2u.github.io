thank you so much honestly thank you so
much I thought I would feel a New Year's
Eve makeup look obviously New Year's is
around the corner and I want to do
something really glam that will go with
any sort of kind of that you're wearing
and so I just did this smokey winged
liner brown in the crease and added some
glitter I've got glass highlight to the
gods if you'd like to see how i got this
makeup look then please keep watching
and also make sure to subscribe thank
you yeah anyway so I actually got a
white robe on because I'm freezing but
why is probably not the best I did put
makeup all over it but I'm gonna roll my
sleeves up
it's just so probably snowing outside
and I'm just like this is freezing I'm
just out of my brows so I'm gonna use my
uh Nastasia Beverly Hills brow gel I'm
just gonna comb this through my brows so
I'm gonna use my other size if anybody
hears brow Jo I'm just gonna comb too
soon my eyebrows I'm gonna use my NYX
brow pencil in the shade black I
actually love this brow pencil
been using it a lot recently so I hope
everyone had a lovely Christmas ain't no
seafood troubles one got some nice
things and if you've got makeup if
you've got makeup let me know I wish
you'd just tell my family like don't
don't get me anything because I just as
an autograph people to save their money
to be honest oh so here's got plans for
New Year's I actually don't know what I
want to do in New Year's yet we're Ian
Todd and a few of my friends tried to
book something literally an October and
everything was like fully booked at
tables and stuff and just like dinner
reservations and stuff was just so
already booked up so it's just been like
impossible to get booked in anywhere I
just thought that standing around in New
York I get so busy and like people spill
their drinks on you and it's just so you
know he just got involved with that so
I'm obviously gonna
my makeup my but always day but I'm
gonna apply some oil to my skin it's
actually pretty little bit dry like
around this area and I'm going to use my
for Sally rose gold a lick someone is
covered in makeup don't judge me okay so
we're going to start on my eyes and I'm
going to use my maybe in the erase eye
concealer in the shade line and I'm
using my mac 242 brush I'm gonna carve
that why
and then I am going to just apply
something over the lid as well so I was
actually planning on filming the drunk
makeup challenge on Christmas Day
because I knew I was going to get there
and then I got so lit like I was so
drunk Pierre so drunk so much wine I
could I had the worst headache and I
just couldn't film my head was pounding
I drugs too much too quick it was just
yeah it was a mess so yeah that didn't
work out but I do want to film that song
folks I think I'd be so funny so started
using the light concealer on my lids
because it shows up the color a bit
better than if I use the nude shade so
I'm gonna set that with some powder yeah
and I did anybody else get redrawn come
Christmas Day or I drink too much wine
Oh God
okay so for this video I'm gonna use my
Too Faced chocolate gold palette which
is their new one music so there's God
they all smell so good so I'm gonna
actually use some sellotape I'm just
gonna apply some here because we're
gonna smoke you line on I want it to be
rich neat see I'm just going to take
some sellotape so I'm gonna first of all
apply some color in the crease because I
don't really like this I'm gonna go for
the shade too so bougie first of all
which this one here
and reason my NYX day 2 brush I'm gonna
supplies in the crease
I thought this year just went so fast as
anybody else but a lot like I'm just
like what the part she went so quick and
I just I'm even more shook at the fact
that there's 4,000 people subscribe to
my youtube channel right what me Larry's
still laughs because I started my
youtube channel like when I was working
full time and I'm obviously used to work
in the same place and I I just thought I
might get a few 4,000 maybe hopefully
but and now it's just like what it just
blows the mine honestly it's crazy I'm
so grateful so I'm gonna play the show
cocoa truffle this one right here using
my morphe this is like a pencil brush
and I'm going to apply this in the
crease as well but I wanted to use a
small precise brush because I want to
just keep this eye right in the crease
they're just a dump in that model so I
felt like if I don't put anything in my
crease it will just look a bit strange
nobody watch my fluffy brush and just
then the edge you know what your goals
for 2018 like what what you would
achieve that you have anything in your
mind do you think right that's what I'm
gonna do in 2018 I just I just think I
have so many things I would achieve I'm
just excited yeah definitely set
yourself some goals set yourself some
things you want to achieve or some
things you wanna do or some places that
you want to go one thing I always say is
in 2018 is try and just like do whatever
you want to do not listen to other
people because so many people will stop
you from doing things you don't even
realize they say me if you all day do
that uh or you know try to put it down
on something that you're excited about
but just don't listen to them honestly
just don't listen to that that was one
thing that I learned
maybe the Aires was just like do what
you want and who cares of you a thing
cuz life is just way too short life is
just your life is too short to worry
people are gonna say or whatever you
know I just think like you find so much
fun so much happiness did not giving a

honestly it's crazy why'd you stop
caring what people think and you you
don't really care like what people have
to say about what you do or you don't
care for people's opinions about you
that is when you I feel that you can
just be your happiest even just small
things like I wouldn't leave my house
about make money because I'd be like
scared that didn't I just all might feel
like oh she looks bad or you know and I
just for sure I shrink hello I am human
being I kind of sometimes like it's
fine I'm gonna take the shades rolling
in the dough which is this big straight
hair I'm gonna apply on top of that
concealer so yesterday we went out for
some food and then like I had to be
ready for a certain time and I'd like it
our line a bit to get ready and I was
like you know uh I'm gonna day a cut
crazy psyche I winged liner I
mean I don't know why I do that because
I'm always late I can't always think I
have way more time than I do so I'm
gonna use the shades so bougie which was
the first color that I dipped into
I'm gonna use my morphe I don't know at
least brushes are seven they were in a
brush set it up numbers see I'm gonna
apply it as if I was doing a winged
liner so I'm gonna flick it way out and
then I'm gonna bring it along the lash
line
yeah I definitely think that
2018 you should just try if not to give
a thing because I get so many
messages of girls just like my real
ideas but I'm just scared of what people
say and he just makes me feel really sad
because I remember when I was like that
and I was just like so scared to do
anything because you know I don't know
he was just a that pissed that I mean
you know didn't wanna face that I didn't
want all the hate that comes with it as
well
you have to just remember that's your
life and no one else's thing you have to
do what you want to do not what you know
other people want you to do want to
please others so I'm gonna go for the
show concrete Roughnecks
and this pencil brush really the same
thing but keep this one closer to my
lashline
I'm gonna take this fluffy brush from
the eggs I'm gonna go over it with that
light shade which is gone so bougie so
for my Jaclyn hill palette I'm going to
use this show right here again I'm gonna
try and keep this closer to the lash
line it's color
going back to the Shikoku truffle
okay so I'm going to use black now so
I'm going to take the black for my
chocolate palette or you can use the
black from the morphe the Jaclyn hill
palette doesn't matter you could just
use the Jack Daniel pine after this
whole look if you want it but I love
this palettes on my morphe M 508 which
is a black shadow and I'm gonna apply
this to the lash line to the wing
I'm just kind of rubbing backwards and
forth over the edge we've no extra
product on the brush just to diffuse the
line so it's not like a sharp line so it
blends in with the Browns I'm gonna go
back to that shade from the Jaclyn hill
palette and go over the edge this
they're just going back to that shade so
beauty as well I am bringing it in this
crease bit here as well Alex would kind
of want to deepen up a little bit this
is the shade from the Jaclyn hill
palette I kind of want to take this like
this type or so can see what it looks
like
I'm just gonna take some concealer and
sharpen up the edge
okay so we're just doing my other eye
off camera just to save some time so I'm
going to use my steel up magnificent
metals liquid eyeshadow in the shade
I'm gonna put some on the back of my
hand and then using my ego Six Sigma
winged liner brush and we're just lie
this in the crease
so I'm gonna apply some Joline in my top
waterline I sometimes you the pencil but
I don't want to touch the eyeshadows
dance I'm gonna use Jo instead so I'm
gonna use my Maybelline eye studio
lasting drama gel liner in the shape
black I picked up black chrome by
accident in a black which is free and I
ran it still fine I'm gonna put this in
the top waterline so we're gonna apply
some mascara I'm using my L'Oreal
telescopic
I don't even need to say what lashes I'm
going to use because you already know if
you need it um I'm using the coconut
shares and more they're my favorite last
year's ever we surprised some House of
lashes eyelash glue they do sell some
beauty Bay by the way from the UK sold
out at the moment
which is annoying so we need some of run
out it's ten pound on beautybay so I'm
going to leave my lashes to dry down for
a bit for a second one I'm just gonna
wipe my hands because I'm covered in
black primer I'm gonna use my Marc
Jacobs remarkable primer which I was
like coconut which is unreal so I'm
gonna apply some of this hope it's not
broken
okay for foundation it would use my
hourglass stick foundation in the shade
golden tan I know I let you went back to
this I ran it out a while ago and I just
had so many foundations at the time so I
didn't want to repurchase it I just
thought I'll just wait until I've used
up all my other foundations and then if
I feel like I want to buy it again then
I will and yeah the faint you want to
have to stop using it because it was
breaking me out and I did think oh maybe
it's not the foundation but I told my
friend to buy it so I was like so good
like you need to get it she was like
asking me what shade and stuff so she
bought it and then she broke out in
spots the same as me like in the same
pace and everything so yeah it must be
the foundation then I felt really bad I
was like sorry I told you to buy it and
then like break you out but I might try
to mix it with another foundation or
just it might be that because I it might
be because I was wearing it so often and
it broke me up maybe I should just wear
it like not all the time you know I mean
yeah if anyone got makeup for Christmas
comment below what you got I ordered my
I got something color pop literally like
over a month ago now aren't you still
not here
and I actually forgot about it that's
how long it's been I actually forgot my
daughter's dad
and I also ordered the Kylie cuz makes
concealer which I'm excited to try I can
see it I'm gonna use my Maybelline the
erase I can see it in the shade light
and I'm also gonna apply some more
bullets
wait you want and I'm also gonna mix in
some of my do or do your skin forever
under cover concealer I've started using
this and I really like it and it's in
shade is every 3-1 which is darker so
I'm going to just mix the two together
huh
she's not too bright so I'm going to
take my sponge
I'm Abby trend and I'm gonna build this
in how am I gonna say me and Todd what
she's film last night I can't even
remember the name of that look up what
was known oh god I can't remember the
name of it but it was so weird is that
this girl and she goes on this boat with
these people these huge waves come and
just like we're in the boat seeing that
nearly drowning and they're like
standing on this boat trying to get
saved they see this big bow calm woman
I'm so by crazy
they feel this big like huge boat come
past like they're not getting saved in
the guns bow and then it being hurt
archived explain it is so up I
just don't get it it's like she's dead
but she's not dead like then they died
and but it's how they killed them but
it's not her like I kind of explained it
I can't explain it I'm gonna fit in this
question much need to watch it is sorry
where you need to watch her and they
need to let me know you might understand
them better than me I've read and
understand okay
I'm gonna stick my rashes on before they
can read you right out
but yeah I'll put that I'll put the film
in the description box and you guys need
to watch it and just let me know because
honestly I don't get it I'm gonna use my
iconic London pigment stick in the shade
4.1 I do actually have a discount code
with I couldn't London I always forget
to tell you guys it's actually just
Holly b10 but like I always forget that
I have that card so um yeah if you want
to get even from them that's my card
offer in the description box but I
always use this paper sicssors to warm
up my face because sometimes I thought
if I just use a power to bronze eye it
just doesn't warm it up as much as I'd
liked you know I mean so I need to set
everything because I look very creamy so
I'm gonna use my translucent powder from
Beauty bakery I'm gonna set my under
eyes this if powder is so good I just
love it you need to try if you haven't
already it's my favorite by far I've
tried a few and this one is my favorite
it's better than or SEO my opinion I'm
gonna set my whole face with this powder
because it just makes my skin look
really smooth
so I'm gonna contour my nose highlight
and contour my nose I'm going to use my
iconic London this is their cream
contour inset which looks like this it's
my favorite console sets actually snatch
my nose because this change is perfect
and the contour shade always burns out
really well but some contour shade is a
cream I blend them up they just
disappear but yeah this one is very good
so and when I take this highlight shade
first of all which is this one here well
now I'm gonna put it on the bridge of my
nose and then I'm gonna use this shade
here to contour my nose I'm just taking
my concealer brush
it's my Mac to 1/2 brush and I'm gonna
bring this down the front of my nose
besides when I on the sides to
light down the front on the bridge of
the nose
I'm going to blend in the concealer
Festivus I'm just going to press it with
my Beauty Blender and then I'm gonna
take my Sigma precision angled brush to
blend in the contour yeah like this
current this contour shader which bends
out so easy for me but without taking
away the products because if it with
some contour palette cream contours are
going to blend out the glitter just
disappears approach disappears so it
smells really good and then just take
some translucent powder and apply this
down the sides so I'm gonna finish off
my eye makeup I'm gonna take this shade
here and my fluffy brush pry that
underneath then I'm gonna use this shade
eye here which is called cocoa truffle
and then I want to go to the black here
but I'm only gonna apply the black on
the outer corner
so for my bottom waterline I'm gonna
apply white you can do black and then
release make it out but I really want to
just open up my eyes and just brighten
them up a little bit so I am applying
white this is the coconut lineup from
morphe then from mascara I'm using my
L'Oreal telescopic again I'm gonna take
this magnificent metals liquid iron from
Stila and shades to make you still wish
to I use in the crease I'm just gonna
file it over in the inner corner just to
give it a real sparkly in a corner one
can use highlight or a big one but Miss
New Year's so once thank you very
sparkly so for my highlight I'm gonna
use the nikkietutorials ever glow
highlight from Oprah I'm gonna mix these
two shows together I'm just using my
brush from morphe and it was not gonna
ruin it which is another wish like a
fluffy brush can apply some down the
bridge of my nose also here I like to
apply it here because it kind of makes
my nose appear short I win this bit
looks like it's more forward if that
makes them I'm going to use my morphe
eyeliner in the show caviar my lips her
lip liner
they're liquid lipstick I'm going to use
my so not sorry and I'm sure a matte
lipstick from NYX this is the number 24
and then for glass I'm going to take
this peaches and cream lip gloss in the
shade honey I love this lip gloss so
much I haven't used it in such a long
time so it's one of these type of
applicators
then I'm gonna spray my face with the
Urban Decay all nighter setting spray
that stuff is so good I keeps your
makeup on all day all night or week or
month or year it's so good okay so I'm
gonna quickly go and do my hair and then
I whip back 30 seconds two seconds for
