feel a little because I went to be
really sick stuff because booth in
Cambridge now have a Knicks fans and
they never used to have one so I like to
swatch things on my hands rather than
order stuff online so I was so excited
and I just picked up both of em and
stuff so I thought I would do it all for
you I consider my receipt so I can tell
you how much is in it and I will link
everything below as well if you want to
get it outside before we get started
make sure you subscribe I've now got a
little cartooning myself down here which
is Sookie I know so make sure you click
that and subscribe but yes and basically
thumbs up if you like this video so
let's get started so first up its up
looking liquid lipsticks these are the
NYX lingerie liquid lip it is a matte
liquid lipstick I feel like if you know
how to many change I mean I love new
liquid lipsticks so I just pick up these
three in the container they look make em
look like they're pretty much the same
color but they're not when I switch them
so yeah I'm going to swatch these so the
first one is number three this one's
more like a pinky a pinky nude these are
a nightmare to get off as lies and like
they are prized what sort of makeup
luggages woman coming off so they're
gonna dance all day which is good so
this is the pinky nude one this is the
number three love that if I could I'd
have many pinky nudes in my collection I
always go for brown eNOS so I thought I
would switch it up and get more Pink's
in my collection and next one I picked
up is number 18 this is more darker news
I'm going to call it pinkish undertone
this one right here this is just a
darker one and again got the pinky more
of a pinky Brown but I love the show
like also the next while I've got is
number seven and this one is a really
light pinky nude this is when I hear I
was really dry out the grill a bit
darker and when we're trying on my lips
now I bought some lip lines as well some
we try them as you can guys can see what
they actually like on the lip and here's
the liquid lipsticks are seven pounds so
you get so much product for seven pounds
and they just seemed so good yeah then I
picked up these suede
lip liners I always buy lip liners from
Mac I don't know why I just write though
never as many in drugstore but now I
have this next panel
if I'm going to be that one's on and I
picked up these three shades so this
first one okay so this is number 30
it's called Los Angeles it is a really
really dark
Peverley Brown today this is the color
of that one so I have another like a
really dark outline lip and then a
lighter color on my lips so this is
going to be really good for that I
always say got number 33 which is called
London this reminds me a lot of the
match strip down to be honest it's a
very Brown very brownie new just a true
brown nude I really love that I love
that I'm feeling winning uses one so
much and then I've got this shade which
is the shade 7 sandstorm and that's this
bottom shown here so I am obsessed I am
obsessed so I'm gonna try this on my
lips so you guys can see what they
actually look like the ponds of course
spot just above my lip there and it's so
painful like they're the words aren't
there when you get spots there you go to
pop it it's like sorry painful goods
when your lip line because it's you
leaving airline I open it up I because
I'm just going to go over and add it
with my 3d bender so the first color I'm
going to go with this lip liner I'm
going to go with the shade London which
is this one it's quite similar to the
match strip down I feel like my line my
lips is this
okay so it's either a nice hot pink lip
liners for pounds the tip liner is four
pounds and I used to find a rap concert
I think with mark
I'm along a longer they're really
creating then I'm going to try this Shh
let roses slip and go to this one in yes
make this shade which is the number
seven
she looks like on the lip what I'm going
to do with the lip bar now is fade it in
and like I love this I love the shade
okay I love this combo how nice this is
like the light is knew that I could go
oh because my skin is darker so this is
really the lives I could go but I love
this I love this is so nice and
so that still apply now in the shade 33
called London and then the liquid
lipstick in the show
seven - you love it I love news I'm will
sound crazy lunatics off now whole combo
on work Sheila says I can't even look we
lipsticks a southern pound and the line
as a four-pound where have I been where
have I been living under a role
seriously where have I been
is because NYX has never been install
near me like never and I like to swatch
things so first why I never really got
them from them but anyway and we some
fuck-ups
so next I'm going to use the shave sound
storm lip liner this is where that gray
some of that Brown was like a more of a
gray undertones there because you get
wiser so creamy off that and then I'm
going to try to shade number three in
the liquid lip I like to see this often
flooded it cooler is one over a DES
liner as well to love that as well so
that is that combo a so nice I'm
obsessed that was number three Nina's in
a liquid lipstick and then the number
seven in the lip liner okay class one
lip line edge to the dark at Brian I and
shade Los Angeles number 30
this is got like a powerful tint here
and then the little it cuz I got is to
show you 18 somewhere I love this huh
I'm sorry really nice so that's the lip
liner there are two with the liquid
lipstick in the show 18 this is my
favorite one thing and then actually I
like the first one I'm going to put the
first color the first combo back on cuz
I think that's my favorite
okay so I just put the first combo box
it's my favorite so that's in the lip
liner 30 through is a liquid lipstick in
number seven I love this is my fav
Allister I think anyway moving on the
next thing I picked up was the butter
gloss by NYX
I love these again these glasses are so
nice these in the shade
Madeline actually have never tried these
until my last video I tried one that has
age another wide
user before and I really loved it so I
picked up this one is just such a nice a
and how are you switches on my you can't
see it on my hand the notes are low so
I'm gonna just get on top of this see
who's me Riley needs look at that
how nice is it and it's so cheap
how much is this the lip gloss oh here
it is
lip gloss this lip pushes 550 and it's
look at all says a car these lips almost
my favorite now the lip liner is hit
with a stick and this gloss eyeglass
okay so the next thing I picked up was
this control-freak NYX eyebrow gel I
just picked this one up because I
haven't - ology of Beverly Hills but
right now and see I picked this one up
and she's a clear brow gel some excited
to try that and I'm open it all the way
home yeah I'm going to search through
anyway theodicy next nail picked up was
these NYX HD studio concealers I saw a
month ending UT and she said they're a
lot like the NARS radiant creamy and you
guys know I used to NARS radiant creamy
all the time so I picked up two shades
of this one lighter one and one slight
like one so I can have one so when I
want to bright under-eye and once I just
get you milk until so I've got the shade
for first of all this is the lightest
one this is the lightest shade number
four and then I've got a jar for one
number six number six is a little bit
more of a pinky pinky undertone but I
flirt the darker ones and use the darker
concealers in this get a little bit more
pinky which is annoying but yeah this
shade number four is covered banana
shade which is gonna be realized from
Rhonda right I'm really excited to try
this because if it's like the NARS
radiant creamy I'm going to be loving my
life because that concealer is my life I
love it they're so expensive so I'm
excited it is so these were how much for
these are the eyebrow gel with six
pounds and the concealer was six pounds
or so if the concealers are six
love them can't wait to try them next
thing I picked up was this contour stick
this is the NYX I think it's actually
foundation the foundation and this is
actually a stick foundation but I picked
this up to contour fix up the shades 13
which is the reason obviously I picked
up the shades of contacts I feel like it
really creates really me I put it on my
hand and then I was like it looks so
easy to kind of like blend engineer it
reminds me a lot of the iconic London 60
so it's probably going to be exactly the
same but I just want to give it a go
anyway so this is in the shade 13 as you
picked up this to contour and this is
the foundation sticks okay then the last
thing I picked up was this micro brow
pencil this reminds me a lot it looks
like the one I use and benefit is
precisely my brow and also the anasazi
loveliness brow wiz so I bought
I need to try this because if it is good
it's honestly going to be way cheaper so
that contour stick well the foundation
stick was 11 pound 50 and the eyebrows
up is 8 pounds so this is good I'm going
to over my life and this is in the shade
Express so it comes the little spooley
onions and then if she just like a
twisting up exactly like the other size
of brow wiz and the benefit precise
eyebrow so yeah it seems very creamy on
the skin like what I put it on my hand
switched on my hand
seamless and creamy so I'm excited
actually had died with the things I've
got eyes I might be like this video
