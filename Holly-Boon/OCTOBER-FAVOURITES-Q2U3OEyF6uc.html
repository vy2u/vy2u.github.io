film an October favorites video because
I have actually done one of these in
such a long time and I want to start
doing these every month again because I
always have things to talk about so I
don't you know why I haven't been doing
it I am just chilling in my dressing
gown because it's freezing in this house
and I just can't deal with this cold
weather you guys like whenever it the
weather is cold I'm just like
hibernating in my house wearing this
like I don't want to go outside so I'm
gonna talk about loads of random things
not just makeup mainly makeup but not
just makeup okay so the first thing I'm
gonna talk to you guys about is this
machine this is the PMD personal
microdermabrasion tool then it's
basically microdermabrasion back home
it's such a good treatment I am obsessed
a bit I've been using it now for over a
month I try and do this once a week but
sometimes I generally just forget but
sometimes I feel like I don't need to do
it every week anyway it's just a good
way to remove any dead skin cells just
leaves your face been really nice and
smooth and clear and all that malarkey I
all I do is cleanse tone and I do this
and then I you want to do this with dry
face by the way so I cleanse tired dry
my face do this wash my face afterwards
and then moisturize and it's just yeah
basically just a personal
microdermabrasion tool and I have got a
discount code which is Holly PMD I'll
link it below in case you guys want to
get it and I'll also just add like a
really quick demo after this just so you
guys can see how I use their be and
that's the first thing that I have been
loving this month
so the second thing I want to talk to
you guys about is this holy grail
foundation this is the Becca on the
coverage complexion cream so I have a
got no no no no no about this on Twitter
and snapchat you guys follow me I love
it I really do love it the likes of you
said to me that it's so full coverage by
the way like because with me I mean for
like completely full coverage or I just
work and see you in a bit bronzer I
never go for like coverage foundation
because they're just thanks to the point
that believer concealer bronzer or full
coverage so I've been using this for
going out nutso or just whenever I want
for coverage and I am obsessed it's so
good the only thing I don't like about
it is the smell it smells like pencil
sharpeners now I know that sounds really
strange but when you use this you're not
I mean it smells like like you know what
primary school we used to go to the
vintage shopping event so it smells like
that you know I mean anyways um I am
using shade bamboo now those people said
to me like it was we said that there's
always mixed reviews on this product you
need to have really hydrated skin before
you apply this don't apply this if your
skin is dry like I literally put loads
of moisturizer on and I spray my face
with fix+ and then I apply this
foundation because if you apply it and
your skin is really dry
it just doesn't give the same finish you
need to have a really hydrated skin
before you look like this but this is
yeah super super super super super full
coverage the only downfall is the smell
and we see the price it's quite pricey
yeah I love it anyway so the third thing
that I want to talk to you guys about is
the fit me concealer by Maybelline
now if you guys have been watching me
since day one I used to rant and rave go
on and on about this concealer and I
only see don't know why I stopped using
it I think it was just because loads of
you guys are pretty getting sick of me
use and it was hard on which try other
things just to switch up my videos or
whatever but I've gone back to it in the
last two weeks and I don't know why I
ever stopped using it because it is so
good and so affordable it's only like
who is it four or five pounds I think is
my beloved woman I'm not sure but it's
so so good I love it I use VSM what's
the difference between this one and the
NARS the NARS radiant creamy concealer
is good I love that it doesn't crease or
anything it's pretty really good
the only difference I would say is the
nice one is a bit more full coverage way
more expensive runs out really quickly
as well
and you have I don't know why over stop
so I'll come back to this and you're
pretty gonna see this in every single
video for the rest of my life hates my
dogs just decided to bark really
me I'm trying to film sorry about that
but um next thing I want to talk about
is the allure I'm not sure I set it up
do you think that this is the die broke
it so I've been hitting my eyebrows at
you because naturally I'm quite fair
my hair is quite mousy blonde naturally
somewhat eyebrows are really really
light and I've seen my hands jet-black
so when I haven't got makeup on my
eyebrows blending from my skin got
enough I know that sounds really strange
but because my eyebrows are so light in
the hair sadaqa just makes me strange so
I've started dyeing my eyebrows and let
me just say the first time I did this it
was so bad I liked it she put it
everywhere it was a great disaster I
think she dog must get endemic then but
what's your shooter on how to do it so
I'm getting a pro at this now advice but
I just got a new one because I started
using my work here and I've lost the
other and went well sucks for another
one but if you love it it's so good you
only have to you leave on for like four
minutes for five minutes away from that
and yeah it's so good I just like it
makes my eyebrows up a lot fuller
thicker and what's the darker so I've
also been using this to try and tie my
eyelashes as well but for some reason
what Ashley's don't diner that sounds
really weird but I just don't pick up
any color doesn't work straight but yeah
if you look into ten your eyebrows you
looking for a good kit this one is
really really good I love it okay so
around this time of year my skin tends
to get more
I in the summertime really oily not
really oily but quite oily in my t-zone
when it comes to winter when the weather
starts getting cold my skin gets quite
dry and also my lips get quite chapped
and dryer things so I picked up this lip
conditioner by Mac and I love it it's so
good you guys it's so good it's not
sticky that it's not one of those bosses
it's like sticky or explain it's
literally just a conditioner for your
lips and I've been using it every single
day like I just you put it on up I think
I did a couple of videos where I had it
on before I do my makeup because I've
always got it on well if what my makeup
on as well just put it on and then I'll
do my makeup and then then obviously put
lipstick on or whatever and I've had
this on a couple of times in my videos I
forgot to mention it and it's so good
I've been using this for Y over a month
I've had this since when did I get this
pre August
back September time I got this so I've
had it way over mum and I still love it
it's so good and especially now the
weather's changing it's getting colder
my lipstick and dryer it's really really
good so if you're looking for a good lip
conditioner this one is definitely worth
the price okay so next thing I want to
talk about is highlighter now I have two
that I'm going to talk about ones
high-end and one's not high-end so I
cents ones expensive ones not basically
so the first one will talk to you guys
about is the Anastasia Anastasio sorry
Anastasio beverly hills new girl okay so
yeah I have been loving this shade white
sound now the difference between this
cock-block here and the other bloke it's
from Anastasio Beverly Hills this one is
a little bit more glittery I would say
okay little bit more sparkly but I have
been obsessed with it I've been using it
every single day since I've had it like
completely utterly obsessed and I'm
using this one for like my inner corner
oh my god okay so when I went out in
London just going to mention this guy
said when I went out in London I posted
a picture I went to the pretty little
finger event and had a purple dress on
and my legs it's really shiny and
everyone was asking me like how did you
get your legs up that this one right
here okay
this is called hot sand and I let you
put - I've got this - body oil I don't
have it on me I was that show yeah it's
a dog body oil I'll link it for like a
sheet guys gonna get in it I put that
all over my legs and like my arms and
stuff and then I put this highlight on
top but just on the Front's of my legs
and on my shoulders and stuff always
glowing to the gods let me tell you like
my skin was glowing so much it was so
crazy I was it you obsessed so if you
guys want really go be skinned for when
you go out on a night out get the dog
body oil it's only like full pound I
think is I'll actually link it below I
got it from boots and then it put a
highlight on top book of dark bronzy
highlight just down the Front's of your
legs and on your own shoulders and
you'll be like damn like also I put it
up on my chest and I was glow and I was
so good but yeah so I've been loving it
this glow kit this month I think out of
everything I'm talking about this has
been my absolute Holy Grail you guys can
even say I've used it that much it's
gone straight for anything right now
it's annoying but yeah okay so the next
one I want to talk to you guys about is
the stroke of genius illuminating
palette I've actually only got this
today but I don't have a like a cheaper
highlight I did have the sleek highlight
palette but I think I lost that I think
I lost art under 9 hours a person whose
her mistakes I love that I never
repatched I'm you know why I think it's
cuz I had so many highlight as I was
just I don't really need to buy it but
it was so good it's the sleek highlight
palette it's like gold it's really
really good it's so cheap as well but I
know she's not sent this one today and
I've used it today and look Haggadah is
I'm literally obsessed so just using it
mix these two shades together and I'm
really impressed by it I really really
like it literally look at my highlight
it's so good so if you're looking for a
cheaper option for a highlight palette
this one is really really good
okay so next I'm going to talk to you
guys about the jarred cosmetics hydro
matte liquid lipstick so I went to the
beautybay event a couple of weeks ago
and jarred cosmetics with that I've got
to meet the owner Jen she's really
lovely and I was saying
you know who doesn't the social media
and stuff like that and they blessed
them they gave me some of the Hydra
matte liquid lipsticks and also in their
normal lip sticks and I'd used their
products before but Italy is dangerous
and ages ago I used to have this equal
if they can afford I think it's gold and
I really like they I'm not sure why
didn't continue using their products I
really part member I don't even know but
yeah I've been using these liquid
lipsticks since they gave them to me and
also their lipsticks and I really really
love them I think they're so good
they've gone really really nice and
creamy they're not just rolling on the
floor they don't dry your lips tile they
they're just really really good I really
like that one don't you know what else
to say is be honest but they're just
exactly one look for a liquid lipstick
not to dry lips out I'm not to feel pity
you know when you rub your lips together
and they go like bitty this isn't
brother which is really good so I've
been loving it yeah so I also love the
lipsticks and what I've been wearing it
she constantly is buttercup it's really
nice proper nude like you know like a
really just true nude shade but it's
really really good anyway so I will link
these below because you guys want to try
these next thing I want to talk about
I'm just going talk about as a purse I
want to talk to you guys about the Sigma
EA sticks winged liner brush it's really
really thin fine brush now I said to my
other videos I've lost my Sigma brush no
and it should devastated because I've
done my wing with this tonight and I
knew the guys can see but I find it so
much easier to do my winged liner with
this brush because it's so small and
thin and there's a fun it is really easy
you control the product and I just I
just love this brush to be honest I've
loved it forever
they'll each know I was so gotten when I
lost my other one and so I just got
another one I literally love it so I
just want to talk to you guys about that
real quick I've got three now you guys I
lose them so yeah I'm sorry about losing
brushes I think what it easy but I'm
very like I don't even know
whenever I seem to go away like if I go
to London or if I go somewhere
and I I ended up losing something I
always lose something I don't know what
it is it's really frustrating he's
really frustrated I always tend to do
something but then every time I leave
the hotel
I'm voice checking to make sure I've got
everything and it was if I've always got
everything so I think there's like
someone someone just died playing games
with me no anyway I was supposed to talk
about the Sigma gel liner in wicked I've
been using this gel liner for the last
two weeks solid everything was hot on
one wing tarnov used this I did use the
Anasazi of Beverly Hills gel liner as
well
the only problem I find with that one is
it transfers so when I do my winged
liner I have to kind of keep my eyes
shut for a while for it to dry because
if I even when I kind of trying to
transfer them to my lid which is really
frustrating so I switched to this one
which is the Sigma gel liner in wicked
and never had that problem it's really
really good it's also really really
black which is good because I hate those
black gel liners where they dry like
dark grey like they don't drive jet
black and then sometimes I tend to put
just a black eye shadow on top just to
make it super matte and also to make
sure that it is gel black so if you ever
have any problems with your winged liner
just literally like being black just
apply your winged liner and then just go
over it with a black eye shadow one it
was set in place it won't budge right
the day and two it will just make sure
it's jet jet jet jet jet black which is
what we want so yeah I absolutely love
this I want to try and get some of these
in different colors because I'm feeling
like so it's not the one liner you know
okay so the last thing I'm gonna talk to
you guys about is the Victoria Secrets
cookies fragrance mist it's really
really good it's just a body spray I've
been using it every single day for the
last probably two weeks not a whole
month I have intended that long but I
love the smell of it and it's just nice
and refreshing not everyday do I want to
use my perfumes my pen is quite
expensive so I don't like to use them
every single day
so I'd rather just use like a body mist
so I use this one and I love it
basically
that's what I'm gonna say everybody has
different tastes moving in regards to
smells but I got this from my local
boots no superdrug Superdog have to have
these it's so weird I was like I'm gonna
they have these Victoria Secret spray I
thought you could get you only get them
from Victoria Secrets but yeah so you
need to go and spray them but I know
they've got loads in there at the moment
so going try them also a really good
Christmas present cause they're cute
awning I love the bow that is actually
everything in the omens to achieve
