I recently posted a look this ilyich on
my snapchat and on Twitter and those who
asked me to film it so the Sun will
ensue and something get started
straightaway I'm relieved my Anasazi
revenue is among the Renaissance
Renaissance I still have to say it's a
danger to me so the fashion I'm going to
use is this color here which is called
burnt orange and I'm going to use one
more free m5o to brush I'm just going to
apply this shade in the crease and then
just above the crease as well
okay so then we're going to take my Mac
- pour - and when I think this shade
right here which is called realgar I'm
going to apply this shade in the crease
then I'm going to go back to my wall
feet 502 and just go with that which was
to share the blender together then I'm
going to take my Mac 217 brush and I'm
really use the shade love letter and I'm
going to apply this shade right in the
crease and then I'm just going to apply
some of this shade in the outer corner
of my eye as well so I'm going to bring
it in about half way and then I'm going
to take my Mac 2 to 4 and go up then I'm
just going to go in with the shade red
ochre which is his dark red shade I'm
just going to apply that again in the
crease but only about halfway and then
the output and when I as well and I'm
going to use my Mac 217 so next time we
take this Stila liquid eye shadow I fall
in love with these like everyone had
gone on about them and I just didn't
believe that they've been as good as
they are they're actually so good and
this is in the shade kit in karma which
is I think reflects a silver in it it's
really really nice so I'm yeah I'm just
going to applied it to one it to about
half way these are so pigmented as
weather so nice
Mac 217 brush I'm just going to kind of
pull at the edge so that it blends out
because y'all need to be just like a
straight line and should just pull the
product a little bit see how these I
highly recommend getting these these
aren't even expensive and I'm sure I'm
 sure they're so good and then
ever loads of shades is welling up so
reach a so this one's up my favorite so
yeah this is a shake it and calm I think
it blow anyway but you need to get it
you need to get it look at that
uh-huh okay so I'm going to just line my
lash line I ran out of my signature line
I'm really annoyed
I had one that's like a 50 but half
lioness I'm going to use my English
airliner in 77 this is a glide on as
well for me but it's all I have right
now see I'm going to just line my lash
line before I apply some lashes and then
I'm just gonna line my top waterline as
well some pilot FriXion mascara when you
use my Maybelline Big Shot mascara just
a little bit I know slashes I'm using
are the Koko lashes in a more I love
these massive I'm obsessed they like my
face I know you still did muir lashes
eyelash glue in my favorite eyelash glue
on time okay so I'm going to finish off
my under eyes I'm just going to pricing
the NARS radiant creamy concealer tiny
bit and then this is a finger yeah I
don't if I have a favorite of Ireland
yet I don't feel like I do
oh I see I love Camilla I think she's so
sweet she's so cute I just love her I
really hope that she does find love
because like she so loved me and I'm you
can tell that she just generally she
didn't ever genuine reason she generally
all supplies them um I'm going to take
my Mac to do for I'm going to take the
shade but orange and I'm just going to
run this under the eye
so yeah I'm having to pre-fill about
five videos because
I miss Ellen overnight now I actually
forgot that I was going away so much
over the next two and a half weeks I'm
away three times so I physically won't
have the spare time to film so obviously
that's why I'm free film but I didn't
think about this until yesterday it
being picking my head yesterday actually
I need to pre film videos so I can
operate one way see ya I've got a film
about five video is in two days and
isn't one
wish me luck okay so we take the shade
lovely' are in this my Mac 217 coming
here was in Sundanese yeah I want to
upload even on the way this scenario
telescopic it's like my favorite for
bottom lashes I Mac strobe cream this is
in the show pink glide just going to
apply it with each of my fingers
I'm going to apply some of my benefit
professional I just to minimize my paws
up a little bit this here just really
smooth out your claws when you apply
your makeup on top
you practically can't see them also I
would another tip if you've got large
pores is I will apply a little bit of
translucent powder in this area and
before you apply foundation I say I mean
I'll do it today that's also a trick as
well if you're very only is to actually
set your primer before you apply a
foundation as you sleep or you in your
makeup just doesn't last then that's
something that you can try so I'm just
going to take someone's recent powder on
my large shader brush by Sigma I'm just
going to Pat this with my pores are
don't want to put a lot though you don't
a bakery zandi's want to fill out the
tiniest bit of powder okay so for my
foundation today I'm going to use the
Too Faced Born This Way Foundation in
the shade golden I've been using this
non-stop since it got sent to me I'm
obsessed of it now it's like literally
one of my favorites it's oil free medium
to full coverage and it's a nice sort of
luminous finish it's not a matte finish
and so there are six new shades of this
launching on the toothpaste comm website
on the 15th of June and then there are
six new shades
coming to the UK on the 1st of August
and that will be debenhams
and Selfridges so yeah keep an eye out
for any explanation but it's actually
been my absolute favorite so I'm going
to take my Sigma fruity Blender to apply
this I have this spot here that just
won't come out like it's just under the
skin it's just playing me like it's just
business for so long and it just won't
come out if you leave these are the ones
I hurt the most aren't in their spots
and they're just chilling onto your skin
what I rise aren't even related today I
know what's going on
they're not even cousins they're not
even second cousins they're not even
like half brother and sister they're
just nothing so as you can see his
foundation it causes like a nice
luminous type finish okay so for my can
see I'm going
the NYX HD studio photogenic concealer
in the shade number six this is a bit
too light for melting so I'm going to
use the shade for and today because that
one's a little bit too pinky yeah I've
heard good things like concealer i
normally use it as kind of like an eye
base for my shadow and but i don't use
it that much for concealer because it is
quite like this color and as far as the
colors get darker they get more pinky
okay so I'm going to take my 3d blender
by Sigma to blend this concealer is okay
so in the separate sponge I'm going to
take my Laura Mercier translucent powder
I'm just going to set that we're just
going to set my flower lines and then
I'm going to bake down the size of
Windows so two cups of cream contour me
take my NYX and mineral stick and this
is in the shade ms-13 yeah this is the
shade MSF 13 so I'm going to use this to
contour so
and then going to take my mac mineralize
skinfinish in the shades are to eat and
I'm going to take my Sigma large powder
brush the f30 just going to apply some
in it on top of where I applied that
contour really contour as such I just
use it to kind of warm up my face a bit
more it's not the right shade to contour
it is a bit warm way too warm but I just
preferred to use it to kind of want my
face and it close look one just a little
bit okay so then I'm going to contour my
nose I'm going to use my Anastasia
Beverly Hills contour kit I'm going to
take this darkest shade right here on my
morphe M 507 and I'm going to run this
turn the front of my nose
I'm just going to sauce top powder under
certain windows okay now what I'm going
to do getting where take the banana
shade and I'm going to take my large
shader brush by Sigma come on this
number from and also just on the tip I'm
going to powder down the sides to clean
it up break down the sides of the nose
like that and then square leave that
again for a couple minutes and what I do
something else then I'll come up there
so I'm going to do next is I'm going to
highlight so obviously I will use my
iconic under the illuminated drops like
when the don't use anything else
and I just tend to just you you think
all the time whether I use a powder or
not I use these and Adam a real I've
been using them about powder and I just
oh look a bit so yeah I'm just going to
apply some of these I'm just going to
put some on the back on my hand like
this and then I'm going to take my 3d
blends up like Sigma and I'm going to
get my sponge in the drops and then
apply to the skin so just gives that
really nice glowy skin without you know
compadre this is one of them I do have a
discount carriers for you be ten you get
money off so use that if you want to
reform even my body as well because I've
been obsessed of that lately
just that summer glow it just adds extra
extra glow which is what I'm all about
so I'm going to apply some of them these
drops on my body as well yeah I'm just
gonna post on above my Pharrell as well
okay so that's what we did for glow
because I just like the way it looks
with just the drops it looks really
luminous it doesn't look powdery I just
prefer that kind of look
yeah that's what I'm waiting for the
drops and so dust off this off my nose
when I take the Jared cosmetics
hydra-matic lipstick in the shade 1995
this is such a gorgeous eye shade
another
okay I'm sad too gosh this isn't weird
Varney brush-on so we're trying to
understand if every hero's blockages in
the is the blush trio impeach you love
