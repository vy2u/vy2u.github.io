channel and hello hi if they're new here
my name is Holly Boone so in today's
video I am going to be showing you how I
did this I look using the P Louise
eyeshadow palette and the eyeshadow base
which I am honestly gobsmacked this is
probably the best eyeshadow formula and
base I have ever used in my life and I'm
not even exaggerating I am so impressed
it's a joke like I knew this palette was
going to be really good because if you
follow P Louise or periods makeup
Academy you will know that they are
phenomenal and doing eye makeup like so
on being very good so I knew it was
gonna be good but I am just like amazed
honestly and so I'm gonna show you the
palette and the base and then we're
gonna get started I have done this eye
off camera just to save some time
so we can go a lot more in-depth on this
side and I have already done my eyebrows
I use the NYX brow pencil this is a
micro brow pencil in the shade black so
here is the Peter Wiis palette so it's
got the louise palette written on the
front and this kind of a rose gold
metallic right in and it's kind of like
a matte black packaging which is really
nice so here you have all of the shades
you have 12 shades in here this palette
is 40 pounds the pigment is absolutely
out of this world
yeah you're gonna see muses on my eyes
anyway but I cannot believe this I had a
formula honestly I also love the names
of these shadows pages so extra lets you
live for it so here is the pea Louise
base so you wear this underneath your
eyeshadows this is ten pounds and this
is unbelievable it really makes the
pigment of the eyeshadow pop it's just
amazing so you're going to see me use
this anyway but I am obsessed so you get
ten mil of product in this Peter waste
base the ten pounds which is really good
and I'm just gonna put some on the back
of my hand
you only look to need the tiniest little
bit a little bit goes a long ways a very
full coverage and I'm gonna use my Mac
195 brush which is this flat synthetic
brush and I'm gonna carve out my brows
with this
so we're going to apply this all over
the eye and what I'm going to do is just
press it in with this brush the reason
why I'm pressing it with the brush is
because I don't want to get any
brushstroke marks normally I would press
him and my Beauty Blender but I'm not
gonna do that because I want to get the
most coverage as possible okay so we're
not gonna set the base P Louise never
sets the base and I don't feel like you
even need to with this one the reason
why I set my base normally is because I
use concealer I don't use a specific
face and when I used to use up my Mac
soft ochre Paint Pot I would never need
to set it and this is the same with this
I do not need to set this if I use
concealer as a base and I don't set it
and why I shall do slide around because
it's not the same thing so the first
color I'm gonna go in with is this
orange shade and it's called sunkissed
and I'm going to use my two three two
luxe shader brush from zoeva and what
I'm going to do is I'm just going to
pack this color on so I'm just picking
up some on the brush and I'm literally
just gonna pack this on I'm bringing it
up just above my crease just really
press it into the eye and as you can see
the shadow is ridiculous you pigmented
so one well sometime now I'm gonna take
my blank canvas 8:42 brush and I'm going
to take the shade pea Louise which is
this mustard yellow color here I'm gonna
pick up some of this shade on this brush
and I'm going to start to blend the edge
of the shadow but I'm gonna kind of
press it first and then I'm going to go
backwards and forwards
so we're going to just press that shade
in and then we're going to go backwards
and forwards as well so we're kind of
packing the collar on a little bit and
we're blending it out I'm not going into
much with this yellow because I kind of
just want to keep it more Orange
see I probably for a long time it's been
trying to find an eyeshadow base and to
be honest I've just not found one that I
liked or not seeing one that I like like
I said I used to use soft I came with my
Mac but it was always just like too
drying through my eyes it would read
wrong well on its own I'm just glad for
this honestly a page like this is bomb
so I'm gonna take my bdellium tools 783
brush and I'm gonna use this shade Queen
which is this red color here so I'm
gonna pick some of this up on this brush
and I'm gonna start packing this on just
in my crease and just above the crease
as well I'm just gonna press it on like
I have with the others
and then I'm gonna go to this brush
which is my morphe it isn't have a
number on it morph you just stay tuned
to put the numbers on their eye brushes
that come in set so just a fluffy brush
from morphe and I'm gonna blend the edge
okay so once I've done that we're gonna
cut the crease and we're gonna bring it
outwards you see how I've kind of
flicked it on this side take some of
this P Louise base and one we had and on
my Mac 195 brush which is the same brush
I used to carve out the brow and to pack
this on the lid we're gonna cut the
crease so I always like to start kind of
like that
and I'm gonna press this because I feel
like it makes it easier just make sure
you take your time with this because you
want to make sure you get it as straight
as possible
also you want to make sure you get both
the sides even so on this side I bought
it kind of like
yeah I'm gonna just follow the natural
shape of my eye and I'm going just above
the crease that way when you open your
eye you will still be able to see the
white you should bring it too far down
you might going to see that white that
we're going to put there when you open
the eye so we are going just above the
crease okay so when I get to about here
I'm gonna flick it out so I'm gonna
start leave it outwards
that's who's gonna flick it out and then
I'm gonna cover this whole part with the
face again I'm just gonna press it in
when I kind of flick it out towards the
end of your eyebrow
so next I'm gonna take this bright white
shade here which is called charm and I'm
going to use this a little brush that
I've got in my dose of colors I shadow
thing it was in the sassy Sienna's
little palette you gets little brush so
I'm gonna use this end and I'm gonna
pick up some of that white shade on this
brush and I'm gonna just press this on
close to where I cut the crease it's
really gonna pack this white color on
so I'm present on close to where I cut
the crease all the way along the eye
this white shade is just unbelievable
like I've never used a white shadow
that's not chalky and is this pigment
here it's ridiculous some decks gonna
pick up some of this shade here which is
called contour which is actually the
name of Paige's dog which is just our
extra leaf right and I'm gonna use my
exact blend a 52 brush from Sigma and
I'm gonna press this in the eye I don't
want to apply too much of this because
I'm willing to fuse it I want it to look
diffuse not like a block of color so
just a little bit like that is pretty a
little bit too much but should be okay
then I'm going to take my blank canvas
Etan brush I'm going to blend out the
edge okay then I'm gonna take some of
the shade besty which is this darker
color here on the same brush I'm gonna
do the same thing but I'm gonna keep
this one closer to my lash line and then
I'm gonna use the same brush this brand
cumbers eaten brush and I'm going to
blend the edge I'm not worried about
this pot here because I'm gonna do one
wink liner so you're not gonna see any
way so you don't need to worry about
that area oh why call that a fly just
literally flew up my face so far I'm
gonna use my Sigma gel liner and I'm
gonna use my Mac 266 brush I do prefer
my zoeva winged eyeliner brush for this
but I couldn't find it so this Mac Pro
she's gonna have to do so I'm just gonna
press this along the lash line first of
all fries are just so gross aren't they
so now I'm going to do it the wind pot
so I'm just gonna okay here's the
problem I've just realized I've just
realized the problem this needs to come
down lower so it's obviously going to be
easy for me to take this one slightly
higher then it is to say bring this one
lower so I'm gonna fix that aside in a
sec but for now I'm just gonna fill in
my wing I'm gonna bring this up into my
waterline as well I always bring it my
water on really helps to bend your
lashes in so I'm just gonna take a black
eyeshadow and I'm going to set my liner
there isn't a black shadow in this
palette but I'm just gonna take a random
one this one's from my Jaclyn hill
palette I'm just gonna clean up the edge
of my wing she's just a cotton pad with
some makeup remover on it
then I'm gonna take a tiny bit of that
face and I'm gonna carve my wing
so I'm gonna apply some mascara I'm
gonna use this but gal bang let's go a
bit a bit
see how I try to it normal so I have two
pairs on these are the morphe premier
lashes I've stacked the very months in
lashes with the smoochy lashes and of
course I'm gonna use my house of lashes
eyelash gray if you're wondering why I'm
sittin here again it's because the
lighting seems to be better here I don't
know why that is like the backdrop just
seems to throw off my camera settings
and it makes me very orange and it kind
of goes in and out so just steamed you
out so we can do the face first thing
I'm gonna do is used my glam glow water
burst hydrating glow moisturizer I
literally love this I've not had this
product long but I've been using it like
everyday it's just so refreshing on the
skin and this is well it's like it's
like a light blue color I'm gonna put
some on the back of my hand and then I'm
gonna use my Mac this is like a mini
stipple brush the numbers rubbed off
because I paid for so long and I'm gonna
apply it with this brush literally this
moisturizer is just Oh everything I love
it I love glam glow stuff I love their
face masks and their creams and just
love the products really good I'm going
to apply some of my Marc Jacobs
remarkable primer and I'm gonna use the
same brush to apply this
next thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to
swap and sale I'm going to use my makeup
revolution concern and defy in the shade
c5 so I'm just gonna spot conceal
because they're quite red
especially that one press the end really
lightly I get a lot of redness around my
nose as well okay so for my foundation
I'm gonna use my Estee Lauder Double
Wear it's going to give it a good shake
and I use the shade cashier which is 3w
2 so I'm just gonna put some this in the
back of my hand and then I'm gonna apply
this with my sponge
so some people were asking me how do I
not get any flashback with this
foundation and I know what you mean
because it does have a high SPF so you
might get a bit of flashback the way I
avoid it is the powder so powder bronze
there's and because I use a cream runs
rose by underneath it kind of helps as
well but yeah I don't seem to get any
flashback with it but I feel like if you
just wore it on its own you didn't put
any powders on top or anything like that
you probably are gonna get flash back if
you are looking for a really good
foundation città graffiti try the Make
Up For Ever HD stick or the HD liquid
foundation because it doesn't have any
SPF in it so I forget Murray don't you
put that that foundation is an issue
perfect so just think on your one you
know and just taking rays the pictures
you want to make sure you have a
foundation that doesn't get you know
doesn't have flash back so the next
thing I'm going to use is take my backup
under-eye brightening corrector and my
Mac 105 brush and I'm gonna apply some
of this under the eyes before I apply
concealer really have sub writing up the
under eye accounts out the dark circles
so I'm gonna prime I can sit into fine
from makeup revolution in the shade c5
I'm gonna bring it up down the sides of
my nose as well I love this concealer
but it does run out very fast
someone did say to take the plastic
stopper out and you get more product so
I'm definitely gonna try that because
I've gone through so many of these it's
let you die we all know I love a lot of
concealer but I mean you know I'm gonna
take my sponge and blend this in
I do use my sponge down and you get
asked that quite a lot I'm sorry I don't
make that clear um yeah I do use it down
I don't use it dry or wise it just does
not work for me so I'm gonna cream
bronze I'm gonna use my NYX foundation
stick in the shade MSF 13 which is rich
and again I'm gonna use my sponge
so before I set these powders I'm going
to finish off my undereye so if I always
take this Chad P Louise is it mustard a
yellow color or my blank come this ear
for you to brush underneath my eye I'm
gonna take the orange shade called
Sunkist on my 2/3 to Lux shader brush
and when you use this morphe brush then
that has got a little bit of the red on
it but it's fine cuz I'm gonna use that
now when you're in so I'm going to take
the red shade which is called Queen I'm
gonna use the same brush
I'm gonna take my blank canvas a 42
brush I'm gonna put a little bit of
purple so I'm going to hit the show
contour on my blank canvas eat em brush
you know for a little bit of this purple
as well and next thing I'm gonna apply
some black and white water line I'm
going to use my Mac 266 angled brush and
my signature line on some way to take
the black from the Jaclyn hill palette
on this little brush I'm gonna set that
line on one more line because then it
would stay with me just be careful not
to actually get this in your eyes it
hurts so I'm gonna take my Patrick Starr
powder that he did with Mac and I'm
gonna use this sponge under I've
completely forgot that I had this powder
and I love that it's really nice it's a
really lightweight powder as well it
doesn't even fit you've applied any part
of it
which is really good so I'm gonna put
some of this in the center of my
forehead as well then I'm gonna apply
some my Mac mineralize skinfinish in the
shade dark deep with my NYX 21 brush big
fluffy brush I love this brush so much
cuz you guys know he's it was eye open
so I'm next going to do my highlight I'm
going to use my laura geller
gilded honey highlight because I haven't
used this in so long and I used to
absolutely love it so I'm going to use
my Mac prep and prime fix+ and when I
spray my brush with this and we're gonna
spray my face as well this is my morphe
M 501 brush I mean what everyone was
obsessed with this highlight remember
everyone was I was this man it was that
when I first started youtube I was at
home when I need ducks everyone loves it
okay so from my lips I'm going to take
my bike ad lip liner in the shade all
natural I do love this lip liner I love
the color it reminds me a little bit of
stripped down Mac and then I'm going to
take my Mac the lipstick in the shape
each stock and I'm going to spray my
face with my morphe setting spray I'm
just gonna use the shade Prynne from
this palette this one here it's more of
a shimmer so I'm going to use this one
for my inner corner so that is the
finished look I hope you guys enjoyed
this tutorial I absolutely love this
pillow is palette and 100 million
percent that eyeshadow base is now my
only eyeshadow base oh it is I literally
love it and it just brings out the
pigment of the eyeshadow so well it
doesn't it's not too sticky into wet
where it doesn't dry down enough and
it's just perfect honestly and I'm so
excited to try the base of my other
eyeshadow palettes but I'm just so
gobsmacked I've never used an eyeshadow
formula like this one it's I couldn't
even explain it it's like so pigmented
without bein chalky and they just burn
really nicely together that white shade
is
I've never seen a white like that
normally when you get a really white
shadow it's even really chalky and just
horrible or it's not white enough and
this is like perfect I'm just yeah I'm
gobsmacked so a round of applause for
Paige
she just upped the game and if you can't
afford the eye shadow palette then
definitely get the eye shadow base
because it's ten pound and it is so good
you don't need to set it you can just
power the eyeshadows on top without
having to set it like I said when you
use concealer as an eyeshadow base you
kind of have to set it because with most
concealers they don't really dry down
enough so what you'll find is when
you've applied the eye shadow it will
look a bit wet like it will look a
little bit it won't like look matte and
so that's why when I use concealers as
an eyeshadow base I always set it with
translucent powder but like I said this
is a shadow base so you don't mean to
set it yeah honestly just in love
absolutely in love so yeah I hope you
guys enjoyed this tutorial make sure to
give me a thumbs up if you did I willing
all of the products I used in the
description box below and yeah I hope
you guys enjoyed it let me know what you
want to see next and I will see you in
