doing a review on the PMD personal
microderm system it's basically a way of
being able to do do microdermabrasion
but at home a lot less expensive and
obviously get to do it in the comfort of
your own home and at your own schedule
basically so I'm gonna just explain how
it works I'm going to show you how I use
in this video as well I'm just going to
explain how it works I'm going to read
it off here just because it explains it
a lot better than what I can that the
PMD the spinning disk is covered with
aluminium oxide crystals that deeply
exfoliate your skin removing dead cells
and triggering the fresh healthy cell
growth so what microdermabrasion is if
any of you don't know basically removes
the top layer of your skin and leaves
your skin nice and fresh and baby smooth
and stuff like that so if you suffer
from like dark circles dark spots bad
skin in general oily skin anything like
that this is gonna be really good for
you I needed to add something into my
skincare routine because lately I've
been breaking out more and my skin has
been a lot more oily than normal so I
wanted to find something to add into my
skincare routine and PMD reached out to
me as I did I want to try their system
and I was like yeah because I've had
might put a vibration before and it's
really really expensive when you're
going to NIC go to your skin specialist
it's really expensive so being able to
find something that's really good price
and you get to do at home is just really
really good in my opinion so basically
just says as the disk spins the PMD
suction draws dead cells away and clears
oil and dirt from your pores leaving
your skin clear and vibrant your skin
can now absorb products much more
effectively weekly used to reduce
blemishes clear pores
minimize fine lines and wrinkles and
you know your skin tone and texture
results are similar to in clinic
microdermabrasion yet more affordable
and can be attained at home on your own
schedule this is what the device looks
like you can it has basically different
disks so depends on your skin if you've
got really sensitive skin if you've got
normal skin depends on how abrasive you
want this treatment to be there are
different discs which is really good so
it comes with like a little leaflet like
this and it explains everything in the
sleeper it also has a disk so you can
watch on how to use it and things like
that my like I said you have loads of
different discs I am using the grey disc
at the moment which is a very sensitive
skin just purely because I don't want it
to be too harsh on my skin I don't want
it to be too abrasive but it just
depends on what you want and how you can
deal with it
so if you've got for ultra sensitive
skin you can use the white disc there's
those little discs and it's really
really easy to change them over and
actually all you have to do is unscrew
this when you pull it out and this is
the grey one and there's those different
ones so just depends on what you want
basically so yeah I am gonna show you
how I use this I've been adding this
into my skincare routine now I wouldn't
advise doing this more than once a week
because it is really quite strong but
you need to make sure that you've got
completely you need to cleanse your skin
and make sure your skin is completely
dry before you use this don't use this
if you've got products on your skin or
anything like that because you need to
have completely dry clean fresh skin so
yeah basically was going to show you how
I use there and if you want to get it
I'll link it in the description box
below but I am really impressed a bit
and I feel like if you've got problems
skin uneven skin tone all your skin
anything like that large pores anything
then I definitely definitely recommend
trying this because it's basic you might
do a ratio about home so yeah so once
your face is actually completely clean
you put nothing on your face whatsoever
see what I do is I pull the skin tight
and I'll just run it along
do you like two strokes in the same
place yeah I'm just going to show you
how I would use it is really loud
by the way so I'm not going to a while
I'm doing it
okay so once you've done that you just
want to go and wash your face so I'm
just gonna go wash my face number back
in two seconds okay so once you've
washed your face you don't want to take
your toner and apply that to your skin
I'm going to use the PMD one but you can
use any one
and then after that you just want to
take moisturize up and apply and
moisturizers for fish okay so that is
literally all you have to do it adds
five minutes on to your skincare routine
yeah I absolutely love it it's now part
of my skincare routine once a week and
I've used it a couple of times now and
I'm really really impressed a bit so I
will ink or below in case you guys want
to get it I'll put the links everything
that are in the description box also if
you have any questions please tweet me
my twitter is at Holly Boone underscore
underscore and just because I find it a
lot easier to answer questions through
Twitter I don't tend to get as many
notifications so it's a little easier
for me so yeah if you want to ask me a
question please tweet me and if you guys
enjoyed this video and I will see you
again next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
