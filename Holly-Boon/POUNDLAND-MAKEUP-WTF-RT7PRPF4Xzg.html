youtube channel and hello hi welcome if
you're new here my name is Holly Boone
so today I'm gonna be doing a video on
pound make up and I asked you guys what
you want me to film some of you said
probably what make up somebody's a pound
out I didn't even a pound on did make up
so I was like really intrigued so I've
got a whole bag of stuff there and we're
just gonna try it out and hopefully we
find a bargain hopefully song is
actually good I'm scared so I picked up
this eyebrow kit which has a warm brown
shade more of like a cool toned brown
black and then like a silver I think the
silver is supposed to be like the
highlight maybe so I picked up as many
brushes as I could find they just had
blows of face brushes so I got this
foundation brush and just some powder
brushes and stuff and they didn't have
any eye brushes so or eyebrow brushes
for that matter so I'm gonna use my
eyebrow brush which is I'm gonna use my
zoeva winged liner the numbers rubbed
off but I think it's a 307 I think it's
three one seven brush just an angled
brush and I don't wanna change because I
feel like the black is going to be too
much and then these ones I don't know
and I'm gonna go dip into the black and
just hope this not that black oh my god
I was good
okay yeah no it doesn't come off that
black which is good okay yes it's just
like a powder like a eyeshadow I used to
use powder on my brows like ages ago I
haven't use powder on my eyebrows and
sewed on my Marie's pencil or like a
pomade this is suppose weird okay you
know what this isn't too bad this
actually isn't too bad at all but for
one pound like this is really good it's
filling in my brows nicely I don't know
if it would last all day though is
pretty not something that he's gonna
last you I feel like if he sweat or
something or I wouldn't do i was at this
the gym or whatever you gonna do because
I feel if you sweat it will probably
running run down your face I just
realized that publishing too busy would
you in um
but yeah like look I don't even think
that looks bad dude
okay so next I picked up concealer I
didn't know what shade I would need so I
picked up what's this one our one ivory
and two natural beige I've like natural
beige or was there something really pink
so okay yeah I'm gonna go for ivory cuz
it's way more yellow I need to cut oh oh
 this is horrible oh my god this NYX
eye cakey
okay I'm gonna use my brush to get close
to my brows I can carve out just brushes
are from pound on this one is my Mac
brush cuz I didn't have any on my
brushes okay this looks disgusting and
then I picked up these which is a little
bunch of sponges these are like the old
game sponges is everybody asleep so I'm
gonna take this little 21 and just bend
it in oh god oh god oh that excite bad
and it's dry man it's like dry as
my needs for like sandpaper that looks a
hot mess
but we're gonna keep going we're gonna
see if we can sort this out
the eyeshadows aren't great you only
gets you get two shimmers instead of
like a matte shade I was like no matter
a double shimmers which is really weird
so I'm gonna use the bronze on my crease
and then use this shade all over my lid
I'm gonna use my eye brush which is just
a morphe brush this is a hot mess this
is a hot mess oh my god I had
faith you know I had faith as I I feel
like it
can be alright you know these products
look okay like I said this bronzer is
looks Orange I can put it in my crease
and it looks Orange okay so from the
eyeshadow duo I'm gonna use this shade
will over my lid which is a shimmer
that's actually nice okay I don't think
the eye makeup is the worst
hey Mikey genetics Uranus right so
picked up this mascara which is turn up
the volume and define in ultra black
okay I don't think that's that bad
I mean it was a pound I think that's
that's you're right okay eyelashes yeah
these eyelashes are just not a bit of me
but this the only ones that they
actually had so we're gonna give this a
go so you get two pairs of eyelashes and
glue for a pound we love a good bargain
I feel like a reader I wanna try this
eyelash glue because my eyes are
sensitive but I'm gonna do anyway so the
hope has the video we'll try the eyelash
glue see if it actually sticks the
lashes I don't know why they like bendy
other way okay a stick in okay the
honestly is actually quite good stuff
that really well actually
oh my god this eyelash glue is so sticky
I put all my fingers and it's like wow
look how sticky this glue is it she's
duct webbing gone and she's not coming
up okay that's gonna have to do no they
didn't actually have a primer so I'm
just gonna quickly prep my skin and I'm
just gonna apply some moisturizer so if
a foundation I picked up t-shirts
because I didn't know what shade I was
gonna be and I felt these repros gonna
be too dark
I'm gonna go with the shade sand which
it's very pink
well it pick up this foundation brush as
well so we're gonna apply with this and
then I'm gonna use one of those that was
sponges to try and make sure I blend it
out so yeah I'm wearing for the shade
sand oh my god this is what the hell
what the is this this is like a
liquid mousse this is literally like
dream up mousse but liquidy mousse like
I don't understand
justic so bad oh my god
I can't do ok the Spanish is a hot mess
there's like no coverage it looks greasy
it's like a mousse / liquid / already no
no - this is that that's the answer to
that right I'm gonna try and like press
it in through this sponge and I don't
know if this is gonna make any
difference but I'm not good at first so
every see nobody's this dusty musty
crusty concealer again Jesus punch and
try bend this in makeup smoothy does it
press powder so I'm gonna use my brush
as my Sigma brush and I'm just gonna
first move is powered up I feel like I
got I don't know if the power is good or
not because because here is that bad
and the foundation is that bad so I mean
this product could better should be
really good but I can't tell you know if
I'm gonna try this powder when I do my
makeup properly because it feels nice
you shouldn't feel that bad so I've got
this powder brush so I'm gonna open this
to use this for bronzer I'm scared
because I'm so sorry
these brushes are actually really soft
okay so here's the bronzer my neck is so
yellow my face is like pink you know
what this bronzer isn't that bad it
actually isn't that bad
yeah it doesn't come out as orange as
what I thought it was gonna I like I
said the brushes are actually really
soft and they don't melt so so I picked
up this makeup stippling brush and I'm
gonna use this for my flash and this is
the brush that I got
in the shade one soft brush one the
brush is actually a very nice color it's
so hard to tell it's like powders are
good when the base is so bad you know I
mean so again I don't can't really tell
if this is a good blush or not it's the
last thing I'm going to do lips so puts
this lip liner which actually looks
quite nice precision liner in 6 and 1
which let this brown color
okay so there's lip right now they've
got the best payoff but for one pound
it's not too bad
so then I got this lipstick which is a
color and moisture lipstick and they
showed one which looks like there's just
like a pinky rosy color okay now I don't
like this okay no to that that just
feels really greasy I'm gonna try I've
got this matte lip color which I picked
up so we're gonna try this see what it's
like just colors oh why did I think this
color I think this was like the only
color they had and I look at all okay so
that just makes me look really old
that's just not a good color and then I
went to say it's matte like it feels
greasy again it was really greasy okay
let's try this what's this this is an
intense color and shine lip gloss and
it's moisturizing formula for a bold and
glossy color this could work if quite
pigmented gloves considering here's a
pound okay you know what that gloss is
actually really nice it's not too sticky
it's a little bit sticky but I should
say with all glosses it's not that bad
okay so that is everything they didn't
have a highlight which is really
annoying but I feel like you know what
if they're at the bronzer and that I
should've would have worked actually
well if that concealer wasn't so bad I
want to try the bronzer the pressed
powder and the blush on like my normal
base at my normal foundation concealer
and actually see what it looks like
because I don't think it's that bad yeah
anyway that is everything I hope you
