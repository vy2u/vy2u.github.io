filming a prom makeup look so first of
all just going to prime my eye using the
soft ochre Paint Pot by Mac and this is
the mac 242 brush I don't recommend
using this if you've got dry skin on
your eyes though it's just like really
really dry then I'm going to set that
with the Laura Mercier translucent
setting powder because then it just
makes it a lot easier to them blend out
I shadowed and it also prevents it from
creasing for yeah I hate doing this
voiceover like I'm really bad at it
so bear with me so now for my transition
color I'm just going to take this light
brown shade from the meat map palette by
the balm
I think this shade is called Matt Lopez
and Suzy this is just a fluffy brush
from Bluebell collection I'll link them
below in case you want to purchase any
other brushes see I'm just going to
apply that in the crease and then just
blend it outwards
so now I'm going in with makeup geek
this is shade frappe and then just going
to apply that in the crease just to
darken it up and then I'm just going to
focus most of the products on the outer
corner of the eye
so I'm not just taking this fluffy brush
from the vanity planet spa brush kit I'm
just going to blend those two shades
together just to make sure there's no
harsh lines
so I'm now taking Coco bear by makeup
geek and I'm just going to apply this in
the courage to darken it up and then
again just focus most of the products in
the outer corner of the eye and then
again I'm going to take that blending
brush and just blend that together just
to make sure there's no bloody harsh
line
next I'm just going to take ice Queen by
makeup geek and this is the medium sweep
brush by Sigma you can use code honey
for money off and B I'm just going to
use this to highlight my brow bone so
next I'm just going to take this glitter
glue from Ashe cosmetics they have an
Instagram rolling them below I'm just
going to apply some of that to my lid
and then I just like to wait for it to
dry just for like a few seconds and then
I'm going to take dose of colors lucky
star glitter and I'm just going to apply
that on top using my Mac 242 brush
so I'm now going to take the ingre gel
liner in number 77 this is matte black
it's actually the blackest fire line
I've ever used in my life I'm literally
obsessed a bit and it's really really
easy to apply as well so I highly
recommend trying this eyeliner and then
I'm just going to use my sanhui bar
winged liner brush I will link all the
products I've used in this video in the
description box below along with all the
brushes and you can buy them
so now I'm just going to take the bomb
and lash mascara I'm going to apply
something to my lashes before I apply
some fake ones and they're going to be
using the huda beauty liner lashes I'm
literally obsessed with these at the
moment
so then to prime I'm going to take the
Smashbox primer water I'm absolutely
obsessed with this and then I'm going to
take the backup backlight filter and
apply this as well just for that
luminous finish and then for my
foundation I'm going to be taking the
Giorgio Armani luminous silk foundation
in shade 6.5 and I'm just going to apply
that with my Beauty bender
so for concealer I'm going to take the
NARS radiant creamy concealer I
absolutely love this if when it gets a
little bit more full coverage than the
fit me and sorry I'm obsessed with this
one now and then I'm just going to blend
that out with my Beauty Blender oh and
also this is in shade custard for anyone
wondering
so next just taking my laura mercier
translucent setting powder i'm just
going to bake these areas just make sure
there's a crease and it stays nice all
day then taking my mr. right brush by
Too Faced I'm just going to dust off any
excess powder
now just taking my Mac giving me son my
mr. right brush by two-face I'm just
going to warm up my face
when you get too carried away with your
 zero fiber brush calm down honey
to users
anyway I fortunately got bitten just for
a bit of jokes you know so I'm just
going to take my Taylor blue contour kit
and I'm taking shade 6 and my duo fiber
brush like this uses a microphone I'm
just gonna apply this to my forehead
cheekbones jawline little bit down the
nose you know and you just bit yeah
so now I'm going to take the Marc Jacobs
glow stick and I'm just going to apply
this to areas in which I wanted it more
lifted and highlighted and glowy and I
really love this project at the moment I
know it's quite pricey but it's
definitely worth it I'm absolutely
obsessed I haven't got anything bad to
say by it so now I'm just going to go
over that using a powder highlight and
I'm using backup moonstone and just a
fan brush
so now taking shade Coco bear by makeup
geek and my media will sweep brush by
Sigma just going to apply some of this
to my bottom lash line and just make
that out then take my lash glue from
Ashe cosmetics and the same bit I called
lucky star from dose of colors I'm just
going to apply them this to the inner
corner of my eye and then I'm taking my
gel liner by Inglot 77 and just applying
some this into my waterline and then
lastly for the eyes I'm just going to
apply some mascara and that's the eyes
done then to finish off for the lips I'm
just going to apply Kylie Jenner net
candy K and that is the finished look I
