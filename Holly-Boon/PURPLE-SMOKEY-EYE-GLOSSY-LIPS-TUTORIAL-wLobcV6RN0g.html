hey everybody so today I'm going to be
filming this makeup look no need to be
requested to see it something slightly
different no wind blowing are and always
do when going on sorry I don't was doing
dialer button though moved on is today
so it's all good but just before I get
started I just want you to say that the
bandit you palettes for our kit
basically what the plan is giving me

don't know what this is I'm just going
to quickly show you so it's basically I
use it my skincare routine if you watch
my skincare routine you need already
know but I use this every single night
to cleanse my skin so what it is is a
brush like this it's got three different
speeds and you get three different hands
with this so you get this one you get
another one that's a little bit more
rough I kind of use this one to
exfoliate and then you get one like this
I'm going to show you you get another
one like this which is quite hard I
don't really use this one quite
sensitive skin so what I really use that
one cuz it's quite abrasive but anyway I
use this every single night to put
cleanser on this use it to get rid of
any excess makeup just get rid of
absolutely everything off my skin it's
such a good product I highly recommend
getting it if you don't really have one
of these I feel like these are quite
essential in a skincare routine these
days and they're just really really good
they just help so much to get rid of
every single little bit of dirt and
everything off your face so yeah if you
want to get this it will be in the
description box below 70% off so it's
down from 125 dollars to $38 so if you
want to get it get it quick because the
link runs out so yeah I want to get it
get it quick but just quickly say that
just before we get started
cousin ILO's if you wanted to get this
so yeah it would be in description box
if you want to find out how i got this
makeup look then please keep watching
so I've already done my eyebrows and
I've also applied concealer to my
eyelids which is now creased which is
very annoying and I used the Beck car we
just cool it back up over my coverage
concealer I really like it
I've stopped using the Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot because it's kind of like
really driving my eyes out I don't like
it anymore
and but I'm actually gonna start on my
face today which is crazy I known I
always thought my eyes when we start my
face today so just using this Smashbox
primer water first of all and then I'm
gonna use the Lancome the Bass Pro
perfecting primer
it's oil free it's really smooth enough
rackets moves up my paws minimizes them
so foundation I'm gonna use the Make Up
For Ever HD stick I used this last time
as the first impressions that I really
really like I've been using it ever
since and I think I'm obsessed it's not
quite actually love this and I'm using
the shade why for 1/5 which might be a
bit dark today just because haven't got
any facedown on so scrubs on my face out
I'm so I don't know if this is gonna be
the right yeah I've got ready skin knows
if you ask me this footage is good
already scale for any skin and it's
really good I really like it but it gets
really full coverage as well the only
problem with I feel like it would run
out quite quick because it's just a
stick so I feel like it will not last
very long but I really like makeup for a
bath I really really love that products
it's annoying that you can't actually
buy them in store in the UK you can't go
into the store and you like try the it's
really hard to get shades and stuff
online and I forget the Nightman no I
was radiant creamy concealer I've been
using this a lot lately I'm really
really not kids run into just on the
crease I shop with spine concealers that
don't crease under my eyes but no matter
how much I set though there was great I
do you know I do do still love the
Maybelline fit me but I don't wanna
patch that and one always try something
different so I'm just waiting this to
run out and I'll probably get maybe when
you fit me again I was like my Holy
Grail FeliCa is the same as this one
it's just nice full coverage
but this knives really incredible it's
like the same as when we've picked me
but this one's like a bit more full
coverage got full coverage but a bit
more coverage but I went for it stage of
like being lazy and like losing
inspiration and didn't feel motivated or
anything like that I've quit for a stage
about the recently and I'm still I came
back on track so that everybody has that
date night where they're going for that
stage and they just go on motivated and
probably block that vibe
I've just got myself out of it
because it wasn't that kind of ecology
as I was feeling a really uninspired was
it one because there's so many
inspirational makeup eyes on YouTube and
Instagram I mean a wallet for that stage
but I'm back it's so it's so important
to set your ideas if you use concede
Oaks it will just crease so bad if you
don't I'm gonna use the anastasiya
Modern Renaissance plan most of all I'm
gonna use shade golden oak art in my
crease this brush is from Kiko it's just
like I've got the eye brush I'm not sure
that's 231 good so if you ask me what a
film with lighting ways I just literally
use a ring light and if it up my my
lighting is not great by don't have
enough space for like really good light
in and also my window is just right
there like quite got quite a big window
so it's quite a natural data as well so
don't actually mind too much but I don't
know the lighting could be so much
better
next I'm gonna take my Mac 217 brush and
with eight shades but no I'm gonna take
shade love letter which is this shade
right yeah yeah actually love that stuff
Enterprise in the crease
I'm gonna go in with shade this shade I
don't know whose it up
then for all over my leg I'm gonna go to
shade over me often associate this shade
right here for over the lid
as quickly did my other my camera so I'm
just gonna apply some mascara I'm using
the Loreal telescopic
the flashes I'm going to use the demure
lashes and these are in Albury these are
the Aubrey lashes and you can use code
Holly B and you get 20% over the gears
I'll put in the description box anyway
case you want to get these I really like
them I haven't used them in such a long
time they're kind of like a little bit
more natural than the other ones that I
read he's in the gym your eyelash glue
is but I really really love this eyelash
glue sticks them really really well cuz
if you watched my last get ready if you
weren't my get ready with me video that
I like he was giving me all types of
anxiety it was just horrific
so whilst my lashes drive is going to
finish off my face I'm just going to
dust off this excess powder and this
brush is the Sigma tapered highlight
brush and again we take them off you use
car you get money offs as well bronze
that much you're going to use the Too
Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer and this
one's in dark taco
so now I'm going to take my ABH contour
kit this is their trade media and I'm
just gonna take this straight here which
I'm running out of which is really
annoying needs to get it again issue
shades to the man who uses the clothes
off
and then I'm just gonna clean the up
with some power dice I'm just gonna wait
it's gonna bake under the arch to pay
now
so one set same shade I'm gonna take
this medium sweeper brush by Sigma okay
I'm just gonna
then take my tape at highlight brush I'm
actually just gonna take to put on a
shade let me just Pat it and I'm gonna
apply some of this under my eyes
brighten up my under a little bit more
this strain here which is a shade that I
applied it all over the lid I'm just
gonna replace the ones up just under my
eye here and they're gonna corner
I'm also gonna apply some of this to my
brow bone
so for blush I just got this palette
from revolution makeup London this
palette was probably that for power and
I think I can't really remember those
really cheap anyway this is the first
time using this so want to see how this
goes it's going to take this light
fluffy brush from bunny planet brush kit
and I think I'm gonna go for maybe like
the deans two shades gonna mix them
together
at the very subtle she's gotta live but
I like too much Russia for highlights
are so first we want to take the Marc
Jacobs this is spotlight glow stick I'm
just gonna press on this before I apply
a power to highlight just because I feel
like it makes it a lot more intense so
it comes like this I'm just gonna apply
some on my finger if you had a cream
highlight before you applied powder I
will just be a lot more intense when I
take the kicker is to my weight I shadow
I'm obsessed with this my favorite
highlight art and it's like seven points
so I said my founders hangout and it's
so good to see how intense that
highlight is now because we apply the
Cruz bears hey I was thinking the other
day like this highlight trend is like so
crazy because I thought I would look
back in 20 years ever like why did we
used to do that's my face is like wine
if we used to do that okay so I'm gonna
take the candy carry lipliner
and I'm gonna reply are you for
cosmetics this one is Gupta no maka

cream in to turn which disco ball
