didn't react to films as experiment on
this side I'm just calling this like
sparkly purple smokey eye I'm going for
it to just to start from eyeshadow base
I'm going to take the double we're stay
in place Floris wear concealer this is
shades light/medium and then with it my
Sigma concealer s 75 and I'm just going
to call out my brow so I'm just going to
set that with some translucent powder
I'm going to use my Laura Mercier and
I'm going to set my Sigma bake precision
brush to do this to make sure that
there's no I just press this end the
concealer into the lid powder is really
going to help to blend your eyeshadows
to turn around your eyes reasonable
creams even Partizan a zing never touch
it it's a lot harder to do so you set
your concealer with powder or just makes
your life easier okay so we're going to
use the Kali by male palette I've had
this place for all since it has game
hour which is pretty like a year ago
Adele and I've actually don't use it
that many times but I found it and I was
like pink purple shades are giving me
life so I'm going to take my Sigma
diffused crease brush this is the e30 a
and first of all to rotate this shade
right here from my transition color see
how I'm literally like for the worst
video ever today no it's that time of
the month you know you just research it
you're like bloaty's can't be asked with
life you know please don't send anything
of it periods or how I periods are just
enough hey them hates them anyway I was
going to take this shade next on my
Sigma e25 brush
just liners in the crease yes to the new
background by the way yeah I won't bite
usually we try to find backdrops for so
long and material ones is that work for
me they just don't work they just crease
I try and iron oh it just looks a mess
but like it picks up setting them it's a
lie and it's just it's really bad I just
don't like using actual material my
backdrop so I found these blinds like
these are blinds that you hang a
new window there in home base for like
$12.99 I just picked up so many clothes
because what I'll do is touch it touch
it slightly sheet or is enough to edit
it all out it's so long okay anyway
I'm going to take this dark darker side
here in the corner they say buying it on
my small tapered blending brush by Sigma
e45 I know otherwise you use brushes and
I'm sorry if it's annoying about brushes
are just everyday I love them I'm just
going to keep going back in with my
transition color over the tops because
you want to make sure it's all nice and
blended we don't want any harsh lines
and now that see circular motions click
it works well so this part is actually
from peaches and cream it's just as if
you just sit in front of me eyes picked
it up because the end the brown shade so
I'm going to go to this brown shade
right here yes again I'm just going to
flow it in the crease stuff it up okay
so now I'm waiting my wing Wednesday one
wing before I go out I always do this
when I used hump you glitters because if
I use a trumpet guitar and then try and
do my line I'll gain and then it's so
difficult it takes me ages to get it
really nice and neat straight so I'm one
of you my wings first I'm going to use
my Sigma gel liner don't ever use
anything else no as I'm going to use
this as my ear a stick brush from Sigma
this brush is like his life this brush
is life
okay so whenever I some Greta now when
he is the certified dad is like a really
nice pad for almost got private and gold
bits and it's really pretty and yeah is
a chunky bitter so I would recommend
doing your liner first and then if you
get any glitter fallout on your liner
you can just go over L show you so out
reason that house because make it up
good I do need to get a new get ugly
looks I'm not a huge fan of this one but
how about you go around while another
one okay and then obviously where you
put a glitter fallout on the liner I'm
just going back in with my hero six
brush
okay so you want to hit some black
eyeshadow your brush I'm using my eye
pencil brush with Ziegler I'm just going
to press that shadow over the top of
that because it's basically setting it
you want to say richer than transfer and
then I'm going to stick my lash it all
so amusing two sets of lashes because I
want it to be very dramatic as you can
tell so he's into the rushes I'm using
the boardwalk lights and the iconic
lights from House of lashes because I
didn't have any normal iconic so I've
got both the light versions of these and
so the boardwalk because they say bored
wire light and the iconic light and I'm
gonna wear it
Grizzly's yeah I'm gonna hurt you in
things a little Oh I literally acaba
simple at guyliner it's everywhere
do you know how it's gotten rich these
pages I'm like what the foot
so now we're going to smoke other bottom
lashes I'm going to apply it a bit of
this concealer which is the double wear
same face floor of concealer and then
I'm just popping this in with my
precision tapered brush we're going with
that transition color right there you
can bring this quite far down and then
we're allowing it to planar because
we're going to actually apply to more
clients make out so you need to kind of
bring that down slightly anyway so it
blends out last year and then next we
move on with this bright purple shade
right here
you can leave it at this point if you
want to if you don't want to make out
your lower lashline it enough do I
justify a proper black smokey that's
just what I like so it's entirely up to
you could leave it honest if you want to
do okay so now I'm going to take my
signature liner and we're six brush
first women I think that's in the
waterline and then what we do is I'm
going to apply some of this just under
my waterline as well get older bring it
see if I down because we're going to
make it out anyway but use winner bring
it just under your waterline and then
again on this brush it's going to go
over that so much of our okay so now I'm
going to apply some of this mascara okay
so now we just start on the face yes I
hope so I was saying the urban decay we
have makeup prep today it's you today
and apparently this not just this month
so I'm really excited to try this and
this is hotsprings hydrating gel and and
it's you're supposed to apply I think
this is made for prepping skin to make
up this moisturizing gel has an ultra
lightweight water if there are
themselves easily okay so I'm going to
try it because I've tried it obviously
so because this is what it looks like
it's a cream so I can tell straight away
that it's very hydrating and you can
tell it's very water based so it's not
going to make you realize if not oil
great it's very water based which is
nice it's a really nice hydrating yeah
some people don't agree with that and
I'm drew I'm quite an oily in my t-zone
so I'm glad that it's not royal based
and also they've sent me the makeup prep
the lip love sheer butter coconut oil
moisturizing lips cut so I pried them
this early and I realized it someone if
I turn this nut it's a little bit dry if
it's these cells at coconuts are so nice
okay so for my foundations down beneath
my hourglass stick foundation you shade
gold and tan as you guys know I would
use this in a long time so I went for a
fire to be in the L'Oreal that L'Oreal
combination but the memory doesn't much
because of my day and I've got time so
this matches me a lot better than that
at the moment but I still my favorite
drugstore foundation combo the true much
and the total cover is the flawless
foundation but yeah this foundation is
amazing as well if you're looking for a
really good high-end foundation I really
recommend this one it is pure pigment
it's a pure pigment foundation so you
can just keep applying it and fine it
and it will build up coverage without
looking cakey
that's probably what underneath I can
already tell it's very hydrating because
I use this vanishing on the day with a
different primer and then it is look
this good like this looks better it
expected a system ending a little bit of
color corrector so on the terrain my
Becca under-eye brightening corrector
and we're taking this on my signal
concealer f75 brush is understanding
that your lay free blender okay and then
I'm going to use my heart-shaped a I use
the shade like the media and if you from
the UK and get it on QVC is expensive
though so it's just more expensive to
buy it on QVC which is annoying but you
do get a lot of products it will last
you a long time I've other uses like
nearly every day since I've had it and
I've had it for ages now and it's
nowhere near run out so
and then I gotta respect my 3d puzzle
okay so I'm gonna go straight with some
powder I'm going to take my awesome a no
color powder and I'm going to just set
not easy though
yeah this is great reminders okay cast
in the line of mania okay it's a little
warm up my face a little bit I'm going
to take my iconic London pigment stick
this is gonna show you a bit more
because I never take this brush from
iconic London as well and its really
good for blending it in
just a quick five-minute break I was
going to open a cat person
you don't have to piss up the road a
couple of my only got that last so that
wrong is because they cut free
sub-tropical into the flavor of it
anyway so obviously I need to set that
we have to surprise that cream stick and
so I'm going to go over it with my Mac
dark steep and maneuver a minute a
minute hot sauce
okay so I'm willing to settle a bit more
hair and we're able to release the eye
instead sort of the RCM annexes like it
works a little bit better and just set
there I just baked from very early
enough in that era has movement and I'm
gonna try anyway if the really comes out
I will use this from benefit which is
the Dallas Lanza and it may be a little
bit too ready but I'm gonna try tonight
here's guys this brush I'm using is this
smooth
small contour brush by Sigma
so look at kids others but and to do
some harder everywhere I saw weight
standard okay so for highlight I'm going
to take my iconic London and internet
drops this is the original shade I
always used to shade it's perfect from
within design but they do actually do
like darker ones and lighter ones now so
and you should be able to find it pass
through the skin this is the example one
right here this one's really good for
eye mixes among moisturize when I'm with
holidays that is a rolling library and
it makes me look like my little Easter
ops he drops us it's amazing and I love
them so you should definitely check them
out over dislocated holy be ten so you
get running off which is good everything
see I definitely recommend getting them
if you haven't read either so don't know
how it doesn't look as good for
everything underneath these drops which
make so much difference so I'm going to
take my other side via a two three brush
on this frozen sixth class on this brush
and then I'm going to take my seat
Cleopatra's kiss palette and I'm going
to eat this light shade is goldish oh so
right here and I'm going to eyes into my
highlight because there's my it dose of
cool girl by Too Faced which is a liquid
lipstick
and then on top of that redneck peach
stock by Mack hey that is to finish
