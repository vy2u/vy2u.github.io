using the Mac Paint Pot in painterly and
then I'm going to take my Sigma e35
brush and I'm going to use a shade
peanut butter from the semi-sweet
chocolate palette and I'm just using
this as my transition shade so I'm just
breaking this into the crease next
taking the same brush I'm using a
slightly darker brown shade from the
morphe 35c palette and I'm just working
this into the crease and the outer
corner of my eye next I'm just taking a
darker brown shade from the morphe 35p
palette and I'm just working this into
the outer corner of my eye and then I'm
just blending that out with my Kiko
blending brush I think that's how you
say it so yeah
so now using the same morphe 35o palette
I'm just taking a darker purple shade
I'm just working this into the outer
corner of my eye and also sort of into
the crease halfway and then just
blending that out again with my bending
brush now I'm just taking a brighter
purple shade and I'm just doing the
exact same thing again
now I'm just taking a flat eyeliner
brush and I'm just using a shimmery
purple shade and I'm just packing this
all over my eyelid now to highlight the
inner corner of my eye I'm just using
the mary lou manizer highlighter by the
balm it's literally my favorite
highlighter and then I'm just taking the
dark purple shade and working this under
my eye now to create a winged eyeliner
I'm using an angled brush by Revlon and
the Maybelline gel eyeliner
now using the Max Factor masterpiece
mascara I'm just gonna apply some
mascara to my eyelashes before I apply
my false ones and they'll actually start
I'm using are the same ones I use in
every single video and they are these
throughout UK lashes and I will link
them below for you guys and but yeah and
then after that I'm just gonna price
them mascara to the lashes just to make
sure that my eyelashes blend in with the
false ones say yeah you I just realized
that my hand is literally covered in
mascara so yeah that looks pretty
now just to line my lips and fill them
in I'm using an mu a lipliner and I
can't see the name of this as it's
rubbed off and but it's just like a pale
nude and that's the finished look I hope
you guys enjoyed this video and I will
see you again next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
