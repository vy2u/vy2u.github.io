was filming Q&amp;amp;A today because I actually
have another Q&amp;amp;A probably about a year I
actually can't remember the last one so
I thought I would just update you on
what's going on with me and just answer
anything that you wanna know so I put
this on Instagram and Twitter so I'm
just going to go through the question so
the first question is when it when are
gonna married I'm guessing that means
when I want to get married and I don't
know if it happens to happen on any rush
I'm not I'm normally girls at plans
themselves like you know planning when
you just want a sausage you okay that
I've never been that sauce person say I
don't know if I haven't happens I was
going to fly on sets up a bitch and next
question how long have you two been
together
so I met Park last August and we started
with day in and then we started going
out like we've made it official in
September so it's nearly a year be a
year in search of us have been together
how did you inside me we met in Ibiza so
rather I like you don't go to a griefer
to meet people and I just like was so
Overman at this point in my life but
I've never been someone that needs a man
in my life I've never been up like a
bitch I'm really independent to do
anything I just went out there for a few
days with my friends because one of my
friends was working out there so he went
to see her for a few days and I know joy
when I tell you I didn't even give a
 what like I just think I wasn't
there to meet boys and stuff I just
wanted to just go and have a lot off and
Webber and he saw me got makeup on the
first day like I'm sorry doesn't only
happen but yeah it's funny it's funny
back then I was just so like always
interested in meeting anyone isn't the
way when you don't want to meet someone
you meet someone that year it's always
the way so is where did you get your
boob job done I went to a hospital
hospital and Cambridge called spire and
I had a doctor called dr. Erwin and that
was about two years ago just over two
years ago else has crazy that
she's lying that seems like two minutes
ago favorite places to go out in
Manchester bars and clubs
okay bars artists billion fields with
closing little while and there's like
neighborhoods tattoos lead hike
restaurant bars run there and the spin
observers a good area and then clubs I
like top live and they also like panacea
hungry like Manchester is a long way to
all the time and the club live and
panacea Omaha rubbings best ways to get
noticed by brands if you are an aspiring
youtuber hashtags and tag you make
obviously whenever you wear make up
their makeup tag their hash tag them
just hash tags that it's using their
hash tags helps a lot just keeps Hagins
keep tagging tagging tagging italian and
hopefully they will no issue but that
situated is tag doing everything like
tag all the makeup details are like
everything i filled it in our eyebrows
foundation everything is tagged it all
and hash funny all that helps so much
where's your favorite hair extensions
brand name more than one love you hello
easy and I get pretty ones extensions I
miss vixen a brush in London they are
incredible hair I finally explained like
if a hundred percent Russian hair or
something on even though I think it's
like Russian hair and it's just in same
hair just a joke and as I approve others
extensions I don't particularly like
clip ins because they'd give me bald
patches like and I used to wear them
constant so they are look at me but ball
patches and seeing that my hair so I get
pre bonded they last me about three and
a half months and have to get a new set
and I never have any problems with them
you can part see them because my hair
jet black and and I also have beaut
Beauty works really good brand as well
but I'm going to make some blush and
I've had hair rehab London I've had very
good I've never tried them but yeah I
like pre bonded extensions over like
business stuff I got weave in behind
we'd like a day
I worked on my friend's house and her
mom did my weed for me and then I
actually figure out after a days I just
couldn't do like I can't admit she was
just nice I didn't like the form of a
like scratch my head drivin him okay
anyway and go how many siblings yes I
have a sister who's a year and three
days older than me and I have a brother
who is 18 how did you build your YouTube
/ instagrams house today
I've got ask you questions so often and
honestly kind of mimics like I've
explained I can't give you like 10
meters after that if you don't know like
I know it sounds really weird but I just
started posting make objects tagging
brands hash tag in then it would like
the personally but notice 5 million
lashes nearly getting to you she posted
me I've got followers from that and then
it all just went from there really it
was really random and I start doing
YouTube videos and there's a beauty
video on my channel and it is so bad so
bad like my face my eyes I chose my fav
ended and it's got like a million views
and I'm like how tough but has that mean
you've got a million views when I think
you want to read the comments between
before you going in on me you know but
literally no that's not everything ok
type on that video but I just look
around us in that video I'm just like
what the my actually wasn't even
vendor but anyway robot start somewhere
Vietnam from there it just kind of grew
it's all just been a bit like crazy you
know I never had plans in Islamic sense
there was no like technique there was no
strategy
it just it is what it is it's really
random but yeah and do you want to get
married have kids at wage I don't got to
put ages on things because I would just
so half as it goes with the flow like I
just believe that God has a path for me
that makes sense and then I just believe
that like you're just going to have this
going to happen I'm just like that I
just go with the flow I don't rush
things I don't worry about being doing
things by certain ages I'm not like that
so if it happens it happens if it
doesn't it doesn't it wasn't for me
Jeremy in budget I am so I don't know
besides makeup what are some other
hobbies that you have
and honestly makeup takes up a lot of my
life a lot of my time exactly I dedicate
so much time to my YouTube I'm like 110
and working on things outside of YouTube
that I can't talk about but it just
takes up so much of my time and my thing
I don't have time to kind of like go and
have a super hobby have any sense and
but I love it obviously like just my
life that make up an issue in my life I
love it so yeah I don't really have a
hobby on the side I don't really have
time to have one fit yeah what made you
fall in love with makeup and I'd say the
biggest inspiration for me when it came
hands makeup was Lauren Kyte's when I
first I hadn't even made a new church on
this point and she opened my eyes to
like makeup but has no idea about my
life before I show videos I did she
would just wear like fake tan on my face
and Rosen foundation in from skin was
actually really good I think she swear
faked on my face do my eyebrows and duck
a tiny bit of mascara I wasn't like that
into excitement really understand it and
then I started watching Lauren house I
just initially my joke became obsessed
with it like obsessed and makeup to the
point where as like crazy but my mom I
remember like I didn't earn how much
money like then I was like skin I was
broke and then my mom like was I would
do a Christmas I I'll get you something
nice whatever so I just write down loads
of products it's Lauren G's in her video
I was like can I just have like was it
always access expensive I was like just
can use picks and run oesophagus list
and I remember she got me that better
she bought me everything that's on the
list for Christmas and I literally I
remember I was just so excited to use it
I was like oh my god I've never had
high-end makeup before I'd always had
like drugstore makeup I've never been
ever bought it so when I had the other
mask and saw that I was like and then
it's from then I just became so obsessed
I just which try everything but I'd get
you were a whole month and then I spend
majority of my wages after bills and
stuff it's like everything that I have
there so husband or makeup and then I
practice and practice and practice
right there's because there's cocaine so
obsessed of it I honest lyrics man I'm
still on CSS of it now advice to others
of what who wants to start YouTube go
for it I think a lot of people hold back
because they feel like admittedly you
have to have tough skin because you are
going to get a lot of things like there
are people not if one in the world is
nice you know and then people are gonna
say nasty things people are going to be
very - you have to be willing to but it
can just brush it off well let it go
over your head cuz it if you let it
affect you it can just and I can just
knock your whole confidence and
everything so you have to be someone
that can deal with that if you can deal
with people coming at you on a daily
basis and go for it
listen over it there's no other reason
it could hold you back from it other
than if you're a sensitive person you
can't deal with that then I want advice
you're doing it just for close if it can
affect you massively if you if you don't
just let it go over your head and if you
know I'm good at dealing with like hey
and abuse or the daily basis is because
I when I used to work at my call center
when I liked a cold calls in art and I
used to get abused on Friday like people
return to Fr people would call me like
zero little scamp
people would call me all sorts of
down the phone all day every day for
like a year in half so I just came like
used to it like getting shouted out and
getting to be done by not just okay with
anything for me so when people write at
least to me I'm just like I think about
do not I mean I just think I'm a vote
but you have to be a tough person
that's the anything I say that could put
you off doing it other than that go for
it what apps cameras do you recommend
and lighting to create a perfect image
natural daylight all you learn is a
little while ago right I used to be
obsessed to bring light box lights or
that right but natural daylight I
mean England really we don't get much
but when we do getting out to a daylight
sunlight that is the best light and you
can have for a makeup picture I swear to
God and I put it on my iPhone most the
time when there's natural daylight it's
a nice sunny day I will take a makeup
picture on my iPhone and it will look
ten times better than all my camera I
have the eye friends
seven plus by the way and this camera is
songbird slow glitch so if you if you do
an upgrade or you need a new phone
whatever I definitely recommend getting
this on the camera and this is so sick
you won't need it another camera that
make sense so i used the back camera not
the front camera the back camera and
then natural daylight and it just gives
you the best pictures but i mean the UK
we Rea have nice daylight so mainly i
use a ring light and then i have a flash
i use the flash on my camera it shows at
my makeup details i use this which is
the sony a5100 it also has a built-in
skin softener and you can turn it out
from low medium high i normally have it
on liable media if my skin is looking a
bit
someone's up it on medium I'm not the
larger but my um put it under low and
then it just gives you that smooth a lot
of people things like airbrush my
pitches you can also even know how to
use that okay I am the most untechnical
person you can meet right I don't know
how you use Photoshop have no clue but
this camera has got because it's got the
built-in skin soft night gives you that
kind of like airbrush soft not so much
airbrush because you feel my skin gives
you that soft sit like that smoothed out
skin look and see how this camera bomb
like this camera is so sick I'll link it
below so guys run agin it and because a
lot people get confused between the a
500 and a 5 100 this is the a 5 100 but
yeah that comes
Wow apart from that if you haven't got
the money because I now have the money
at first just use your iPhone and
natural daylight honestly but use the
back camera no matter what iPhone you
have always use the back camera also use
it on flash even if you have got natural
daylight because it kind of like a spoke
it sharpens everything a little bit more
to reroute with but I would use the back
cover on camera and how do you do an
image in me Sasha no Java my runs of
what we were both with a pretty little
thing
I think it's Sofia Richie it's Sofia
Ritchie's nor McFly for pretty old thing
in type in London and we both went to
the event and I'm ahead and assume I'm
at her mojo
as soon as I'm at how like this is a
tiger I with like she's just so
like you know which is like she's just
amazing that I just love her energy her
vibe has been about us love her so then
literally since then we haven't stopped
talking since I've been really we would
take each other way together and then we
just came closer and closer and closer
and now we're like inseparable
I'm going away of each other next week
I'm so excited if you could only wear
one outfit for the rest of your life
what would it be and to know what I used
to be a really glam is an outfit wise
well I see my face is always gone but I
used to be outfit-wise like slow down
all the time but lately luckily I'm
feeling more like chill drives like tops
like this and like leggings and but
track suits and like trainers and stuff
I'm getting insight you know that's
happened to me I used to be like yeah I
used to be glam distrusted and Taiwan
isn't all sorts of to favorite
foundation
I have two favorite foundations and at
the minute my L'Oreal True Match and
L'Oreal total cover mixed together is
always going to be a favorite of mine
then no doubt about it
the only problem I've had lately is the
shade that I had did have mixing
together on that sometimes it's a bit
great it's not quite the right tone it's
really hard to find the right file is in
the L'Oreal but the consistency of the
actual to fast
foundations mix together is really nice
it's a full coverage satin finish which
is what I love but recently I've been
using the Too Faced Born Free foundation
it is a high-end foundation but it's
basically the same sort of finish as the
two L'Oreal foundations but obviously
you don't have some mixed to addleson
they have so many colleges foundations
so I mean I have one for when I'm not so
tired and while one or more times it's
just so yeah that's a lot faster soon
we're going to lightly the Born This Way
how did you get your YouTube channel to
come to recognize
I was I just start a channel on myself
but wouldn't we know where to start
it's one of those things it's just like
I had no idea I'm like Jake it I for an
even I can make money I didn't even read
this could be a career I honestly had no
idea I thought you just make videos for
fun honestly that's like this
people used to balconies making YouTube
video I wanna see a Jamaican I thought
oh my god other words you guys in my car
by that's so cool like I started that
people want to see how I did my makeup I
was so cool as I move on and then it's
kind of like grew and grew and grew and
I was like wait what this is Mars yes
we'll be so consistent events one thing
I would say diantha morality with
uploads
once every two to three months or once a
month and you've got beyond it once a
week I'll say it says when I wants to
start you have to be on it and
consistent and you have to bring up
content at least once a week at least I
mean push for two times a week but
someone's life and getting away I get
that and I don't think people understand
that hours are going to end in like the
behind the scenes stuff I would say try
and do twice a week maybe once a week
but minimum what doing because it's hard
to grow if you're not consistent
you won't gradually not consistent
because people are most subscribed to if
we just don't want to be like once a
year you know I mean you have to be on
it if you can only eat one food for the
rest of your life what would it be a
chicken
Nando's chicken I love chicken
I can eat chicken all day every day I
never get bored of chicken I can eat
chicken every day of my life and I would
never be like ah so sick of reading this
I love it I just want I just yeah I need
an Android in my house so I'll just be
absolutely on rural
yeah this is for America we don't know
what Leno says but if you go home to the
UK you need to go to Nando's now maybe
just hook me up with black cod you don't
know a certain about my us friends in
there I just gave them a little plug
core Nando's come on if you could go
back would you change anything or do
anything differently about getting your
villains no I love my teas my people / -
 nobody's asking when do I want to
get married and have babies like God has
a plan for me he knows God knows okay
ask God can you tell me how you look
after your extensions and holiday piece
for example keeping the hair away from
chlorine etc I mean I go in the pool of
my hair I hope it's in the rush I'm
watching this because I don't not
supposed to do that but I do use sulfate
free shampoo that's a must
would you rather ride through a desert
taking the zipper for a week straight or
at like Corinne for the rest of your
life but surely if you rode through the
desert naked on a zebra for a week you
would die and you would burn like you
would burn you'd be so burn I think I
don't even know that is just like I
don't know sorry I can't answer that I
don't really do evil eye ridges I do
believe in God I don't go on about it
too much because I don't know whether to
force it on people if you don't believe
me then leave it but I do believe in God
and then yeah what scares you the most
I'm not really scared of anything I'd
say because I just feel like able to
come for a reason and everything I don't
know what scares me the most
I don't know you really I really don't
know I don't really think about it too
much
I'm not scared to die I'm not scared we
should tie mr. time and Irene I don't
know when I was younger they were at
school I was like so terrified of dying
because when I was about 13 or 14 for no
15 I was 14 or 15 it was a lot of people
my age dying around me it was really
like favorite school were dying I do
this is that people my age around my
area
died in one time and I just got really
like I just got very hot worries about
it but I have grown old I've just become
so carefree and so like it is what it is
you know I mean I just think the best
way to live your life don't worry about
things and they dwell on things and it's
just going to happen it's going to
happen do you not I mean where's your
biggest pet peeve when it comes to
makeup
otherwise I'd like makeup with such an
expression of personality and I don't
really have a pet peeve I mean everyone
likes what they liked you know what I
mean
the only thing I do that annoys me
actually a bit of a pet peeve Instagram
is then people feel the need to do these
Instagram tutorials and like get a spoon
and like set 5 then their car or you
know use a knife to do their
contour I just think don't do that like
don't do the most of who you'd like stop
doing the most just do you like because
we like it not watch if they don't again
stop people take it too serious and
people think I need to get views oh my
god I'm only saying crazy like I'm going
to contour weather apps with a
dildo that you don't need to do that
babe honestly you don't need to be good
at makeup is cool your yoga name is just
don't stress yourself don't do the most
what's your favorite videos to film
apartment makeup I like doing videos and
images
I wanted to videos at odd reason was
like nerd I'm like Todd's listed boy
since when I got me got on with doing
that might be funny
come on sit for the tip from the YouTube
channel sit for the viewers but he's
like everyone to it but little did you
know and we have to cover he's going to
have a Rob time I'm will evolve together
so I'm gonna grab the new zoella and
alfie Boe condo he to the network do you
ever want your own makeup clothing line
or anything like that love you let me
see i am working on something it takes a
long time that we tell you and it takes
it's a lot of money so i am investing
though new worry I've got something some
with me they're coming out I can't say
when because I'm a perfectionist with
perfect because I coming out of ain't
perfect but just bear with me I've got
some things that must leave what advice
would you give to your younger self
don't work too quick but don't rush to
grow up it's cool take the time giggle
thing have fun there's life I think is
so much pressure on younger girl and you
feel that you have to grow up so fast
and really no pave your bodies and being
a santa claus until 17 years old okay
because growing up sounds will fall in
game jab
is not you know where your young one you
want to stay up late yeah we been out on
this stay up there you watch cartoons
now only had to bed early so I mean I
just think that advice from younger
selves don't grow up too quick enjoy
your lives and I say to myself now I
even like two years ago
don't stress about things you can't
change but how many like people show
sells out about stuffings on in the past
forget we did in the past keep it moving
forget that move one understood come a
better person and learn from it very
stress about flying it use you're too
weak survivors if Danis gone it's gone
it's been and done by Trish yourself I
out like I stress about things as well
likely to change to say like I know I
reverse my fire to a pole and it's
whatscratch I belong have gone on my
alright and I was like okay I've done it
now so I'm just gonna have to deal with
it I just deal with things that are not
a de-stress you know cuz dressings just
not good like your exams like I know
love your cooking sounds going on please
just try your hardest but don't stress
yourself out
I mean I was never very good at school I
never understood things I just I don't
know I got to the point where gave up
with school because I just could think
didn't understand I didn't get it and I
is not giving up don't give up I'm not
saying give up do not give up don't be
like me don't give up keep trying but
though stress our self I it will be what
it will be and everything will turn out
for the best like there will be
something for you and that's something
that I would tell me on myself as well
as diet stress just are you stress
stress just I'm stressed it is what it
is going to flow life is what it is your
days could be gone tomorrow to just live
your life and very stress that's what
I'm saying now that is a lot of
questions I have answered so I am going
to shot because if we get a bit tedious
