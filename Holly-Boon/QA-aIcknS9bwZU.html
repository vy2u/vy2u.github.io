and answer video so a lot of you asked
me so many questions and I don't get
round silence when all of them all the
time so I'm really sorry for that and if
I do miss your questions on Instagram
and because sometimes I haven't actually
seen them and just make sure you either
you can direct message me you can email
me you can whatever and I will answer
um but yeah so this is just to get so
you can get to know me a little bit more
um and gives me an opportunity to answer
some of your questions and there are a
lot of questions on here there's about
there's about 80 questions so I can't
actually answer all of these because
I'll probably be here all day but I will
do my best answer as many as I can so
yeah okay so MZ on instagram has asked
me how do you maintain your tan okay so
I did used to use some beds all the time
I lightly less so bad a few I I wouldn't
actually recommend anyone using them sa
bad for you but I was just so sick of
fake town like because you know what
fake town guys like it goes all patchy
and have to scrub it off and do it done
it's just it's just a nightmare so I was
using some beds up until about about
three weeks ago
flip using them and purely because they
weren't actually making me as brown as
it was last year like I used them last
year quite a lot and I was sold hands
and this year I've changed some bed shot
but I just feel like it just takes me so
long to get talent just annoys me and
and also it's really really bad for your
skin
so I have decided I've tried so many
fake tans because I hate hate looking
orange and that's just horrible I hate
orangey the horrible look and so I have
tried so hard to find on the actually
makes you look Brown and what I've got
on now is the central pay dark bronzing
mousse and it's really really good it
makes you look brown it lasts about 3 to
4 days and what I'll do is I'll get in
the shower or an exfoliate
and then i'll mooster eyes leave it for
about probably overnight and in the
morning I'll just fake town on leave it
on for about eight hours and and then
wash it off and it literally last me
like three or four days it doesn't
really tend to go patchy either like
some fake tans up notice go like that
looks like you've got some sort of
disease like like skin disease and it
horrible and this one actually doesn't
do that which is great and so yeah that
is what I use and I would recommend it
to anyone
oh yeah okay so DeLong Road dune man I'm
really so if I said that wrong I'm so
sorry but you passed me Kendall or Kylie
um I'm gonna have to go Kylie like I
love her so much I just had like the
Lisa swagger secret yeah I'm gonna have
to say Kylie because she's just I just
love her she's always switching up a
style like she's not predictable she's
just like I just love her love my style
I just love everything about her so now
let's go Kylie although I love Kendall
she's flawless amazing but highly
definitely my favorite but yeah it's
under Michael I'm really sorry about
isn't so bad it's a name so I'm Reese
I've said your name wrong
and but you've asked me what are your
favorite lipsticks so we've lipsticks
I'm not really a fan what I do use is
lip liners and I just fill my lips in of
lip liner and I like matte lips the Mac
matte lipsticks aren't great that I
don't really like them because they make
my lips I'm really really dry and and I
feel like they wear off I was like an
owl and then it goes all like soaks into
your lip and it just goes of like
horrible and then you trying to put on
it just it's horrible so I normally just
get lip liners and fill my lips in with
them and I have got a few I shall have
what favorite nude that I do like that's
like a satin type lipsticks from Mac and
it's called Jubilee and I do wear that
sometimes so I do that that but mostly
lip liners that's why it is okay so now
Waterhouse thinks is that right and
watch the bed
to contour palette question mark okay so
I haven't used a lot of contour palettes
and but I use of light concealers dark
containers dark foundations to highlight
and contour don't really use palettes
and the best palette I've actually have
used is the Anastasia Beverly Hills
cream contour kit I love it it just
blends so nicely it's just if you're one
of the people you just starting up
contour it it's going to be easy for you
because get a Beauty Blender and it's
just it's so easy spending so easy to
use so I would recommend that if you
just starting out contouring or you just
want something that's easy okay so the
Lydia has asked me what brand you use to
dye your hair black especially if you
want to go for a pure black look like
yours okay so I am a hater hater hater
hater of Box hair dyes I just hate them
I hate I don't know why they just threw
my hair then they fade after like two
minutes I just
no no not fitting them I don't go to the
hairdresser's II because they charge you
like 80 pounds for to dye your hair and
it's like I could sign up myself so what
I do is I don't know obviously I'm from
the UK and I know like that follow me
off on Mike American things like that I
don't know if you have this we have a
store called Sally's Beauty like and you
can go in there you can buy Cylon dies
and things like that and my sister did
hairdressing so she's actually got trade
card which is what I use and so I get
like discount moves at that but the hair
dye and there is amazing it's just sad
on hair dye and I use it just on my own
but no one wait a minute button or
outfit yeah and so that's what I use I
use a mate with XP 200 and I don't know
what the numbers means like 2.5 but
maybe not I don't know but it's blue
black and that's what I use cuz I like
that blue tint to my hair and you have
to get the peroxide to mix with it I
normally get about 3% anything above
that it's just not it ruin your hair so
don't get anything about that
and with these box ties the reason I
don't like them is because they have
actually got like 9 to 12% peroxide in
them which actually does really know how
I also if you ever want you to go light
of your head they're so hard to get the
color out when I got my hair done at the
hairdresser's I wanted to go light one
time this was years ago just got in I
don't thoughtful but and she said to me
like don't ever use box size because
there's so hard to get out of your hair
and so yeah that's what I use it works
really well for me I think you can
actually if you don't have a Sally's or
I have that near you and you can
actually get it online
and I will try and find a book and I'll
link it below if I can find it
mvs called XP 200 and it's blue black
that's my case it's tailored kalos sorry
I'm so bad at readers and what mascara
or fake eyelashes do use because they're
always so on point
ah thank you and so I use mascara I'll
just pick up any I'm so bad because I
wear false eyelashes it doesn't really
matter which I'm sorry like use I use
like the Rimmel or I picked this one up
the other leg Max Factor masterpiece are
there some villainous keep using this
and but eyelash is so I get my eyelashes
and they're called the long lash from
Sorel UK so a website I will link them
below and the girl that runs it she's so
lovely and say yeah if you want
eyelashes like mine so I'm going to go
round tomorrow daily and then yeah I'd
recommend her like I use user damages
Ardell sorry ardell lashes but now these
hands I'll never go back to these those
other ones because he's just my life so
yeah okay so a page and Instagram called
fashion land mag you've asked me
wondering what you use for videos and
editing of a basic Canon and I'm a kind
I'm Mitch lead rulers okay so this is me
all over I'm so clueless
it's just ridiculous like and even this
too complicated I had to live literally
so I have in some song NX 3000 it's
literally the easiest camera to use ever
like there's not loads about
things that are and you can Wi-Fi it
straight from the camera to your phone
and which is just fab and I've got I
actually don't have an iMac or anything
like that I do need to get one I don't
have one so I add it on my iPhone and I
just donated iMovie and iMovie is so
easy to use I can't even explain how I
am just dumb like with things up there
is like from so not technical and I can
use it so if I can use it anyone can use
it so yeah just use iMovie no
m/z you've asked me so many questions I
love it mm-hmm thank you and so how old
are you I'm 21 like so many people think
I'm 18 I'm like we should have asked
that question I should have just left
your guests in I was 18 but I'm not I'm
actually 21 and I actually turned 21
like two weeks ago for the doing yeah
two weeks ago huh you've also asked me
where do you live so I live in a little
village which is near Cambridge and such
a boring place to live I'm like not
gonna lie I exist it's nothing to do
here and but yeah it's okay all right
okay MZ you've asked me again have you
had any plastic surgery yes
yes I have I am not afraid to admit it
because I'm so so much happy and I've
done it so I have actually had my boobs
done I had it done in April best thing
I've ever done
and I'd dive over it one bit I before I
was like a a cup and I was so like not
depressed about it but I was just so
like I watched my dresses and weight
like a woman and I just used to like a
boy like it just I just wasn't happy
with myself so I did it for me and
that's the most important thing like if
you're going to get surgery any top type
of surgery plastic surgery you have to
do it for yourself you have to do
because you want to do it I see so many
girls get boobs because their boyfriends
house
need a boob job all that makes us got a
boob job like just get it for myself
like that's all I can say is if you feel
 about yourself or you feel down
about yourself and you want to improve
something then do it like you get one
chance alive do what makes you happy so
so many of you that like them that's
Harry I'm like so like that's my
business not yours but yeah like if you
want surgery then as well make sure you
research and go somewhere that's really
really good don't go abroad to these
places and get paid like 500 pop or a
boob job like no you probably die they
do it so it's e mo yeah yeah and what's
your favorite lip liner and why my
favorite lip liner of all time is Mac
spice lip liner it's perfect shade for
me if I would like it literally goes
with any eye look I want to do and it's
just my go-to lip liner I'll wear it
pretty much all the time and so yeah
that's definitely my go-to lip liner I
love it okay so cases Saphir I love that
name by the way who is your favorite
Disney Princess oh my god that is such a
good question it's so hard because I
love them all but I'm gonna have to go
with Belle she's a babe I love her Ruby
grey you've asked me how tall you I am
actually five foot four and I wish I was
so large it's not even funny actually
wish I was real tall and so Jennifer
jealous of anyone that is tall like
seriously but yeah I am 5 foot 4
so Iceland Fitzpatrick for the face I
like a slippery and have you tried the
new mac fix+
yes I have and I love it it's made it if
you want to say so you guys like a
summery glowy type makeup look and you
want to keep your highlighter looking
glowy I've actually used similarly if
you want a glowy look it's good to set
your face with because I use powders so
when I'm looking for when I'm going like
a girl
you typed I'm a look and I use a like my
powder to set my face it just maps it
out and it just looks matte look glowy
so it is amazing it's really I had it a
minute ago

and yeah so if you if you do want to set
your foxy when you want to set your face
