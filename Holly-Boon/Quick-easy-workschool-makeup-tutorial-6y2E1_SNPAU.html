really quick tutorial on how to get a
simple school or work makeup look and a
lot of you guys think that I wear full
coverage and full glam makeup every
single day but I genuinely don't and
this is my routine for Monday to Friday
which is why I do for work but nobody
takes me around 5-10 minutes in the
morning so it is really quick and say
yeah if you want to find out how let its
makeup look then keep watching so first
of all I'm using is the anastasia
beverly hills dipbrow pomade in ash
brown and also my angled brush by revlon
and i'm just using this to fill my
eyebrows in
next I'm just using the fit me concealer
by Maybelline I'm just using this to
cover any redness and to brighten up my
face
next I'm taking a buffing brush by Real
Techniques and I'm just using the
cinnamon shade from my Anastasia Beverly
Hills contour palette and I'm just using
this to bronze up the outer part of my
face
now I'm just taking a fan brush and the
mary-lou manizer and i'm just going to
highlight areas of my face and just to
give myself more of a glow next I'm just
going to apply some mascara to my
eyelashes before I apply some fake ones
and you probably won't need to do the
stage if you already have long eyelashes
but if you have eyelashes like mine
they're just like little stumps then
yeah I do wear lashes
and lastly i'm just using the mac
jubilee lipstick just to give my lips
and moister and a little bit of color
and but yeah that's the finished look
and i hope you guys enjoyed this video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
