take this Smashbox this is the map the
map I palette and I'm going to use this
transition shade in here so I'm going to
just take this shade right here so Musa
on first of all and the bottom region is
the Sigma airbrush blender C I'm going
to go my smash box bold palette these
colors are to die for
like as soon as I saw this palette I was
like I need to correct a rainbow eyelet
with that like it's neat it we're going
to cut the crew so we start with
collaborators such as red festival so
I'm going to take my winged liner brush
by Sigma to the area 806 brush and I'm
just going to take some of that red
shade it's going to carve out to about
this just above my crease and are you
going to do it cuz you mean like this
red color just in this inner corner here
I'm going to take my Sigma exact blend
brush and take a little bit of this red
shade and I'm just going to blend out
the line and then I'm going to find one
more color into the puffy and kind of
blend it up towards my brow so it's like
right in that inner corner
so next I'm going to go over the blue
from this palette again on my wing to
liner brush my ax I'm just wiping these
brushes quickly in between because I'm
using the same brush is over and over
for each color and I'm going to cover it
on right let's start I'm going to spruce
for them around okay so I'm just going
to take my smudge brush by Sigma the e21
brush and I'm just going to apply a
little bit of product first of all I'm
just going to try and flip upward then
I'm just going to go in with some red on
this exact same brush to kind of go the
weather kind of me it's just to make
sure that it burns and it's not
separated something since so where I've
got like a tint of green there it's
actually from where I used the yellow
and I mixed the yellow and the blue to
make more of a transition from green to
yellow but I didn't actually use the
green shade yeah where I applied it yeah
over this end of this blue it will go
back green so I'm just applying some of
this yellow shade on my pencil brush
you're actually a toddler and I'm going
to continue to bring it all the way out
because yeah I've got a little bit of
green and then yellow
so then I'm will get my shape tape
concealer by Tarte and I'm just going to
carve that out can you switch craft out
just going to set that with some
translucent powder the reason why Nora
Messier one so next I'm going to use
shades orange and powerful from this
palette so again taking my winged liner
brush 0/6 make sure you wipe it there's
no color on that I'm going to take my
orange shade I'm going to take the
orange color on my smudge brush by Sigma
I'm just going to start packing this on
yes so don't worry about this bit being
messy because I'm now going to go over
the purple shade and I'm going to just
wing this out
okay
so next I'm going to take my Marc Jacobs
these are the gel pencils and this is a
jade de jour blue then you're just going
to take makeup white and wipe the edge
to sharpen it up then I'm going to take
this glitter from glam crystals and this
is the gold one when you use my silver
one but I couldn't find it so I'm using
gold and just going to run this above
that
so from when ashes I'm going to use the
house of brush our clinics standard we
mean driver use anything else so we'll
start on face so for my prototype I'm
going to use the infallible mattifying
base and I'm going to use this in the
center of my face to minimize my pores
okay then for the rest of my face I'm
going to take my lms biotech skin
energizing day cream or origins ginseng
fresh and eye cream right foundation I'm
going to take my favorite at the moment
we see a fireball total cover and the
true maps and mix these two together so
first we're going to apply some of the
total coverage it's a little bit this
shade is on see way too dark but then
the other one I feel upwelling with
these two mixed together it's like a
perfect shade so I'm going to take my
tree match and my 3d Brenda Y Sigma and
then blend it in I'm still helping our
graph stick foundation I still do love
that but I think this is actually my
favorite of all time just look here
purely because the price is so good
and you're not going to run out quickly
because you're only using a bit of like
the total cover and then a little bit of
the trim at a time so it's going to last
you a long time and it's and it's not
expensive so I'm going to take my tart
shape tape concealer
EJ like medium
okay I'm going to set that quickly with
my Laura Mercier translucent solid all
right so I'm going to finish off my eyes
before I finish of my face so I'm going
to go to the red first boys in a corner
hand
okay then I'm going to go for blues then
I'm going to go in with the orange think
yeah then I'm going to take that - our
blue eye crayon I prize in the water
now I'm going to bronze and of course
I'm going to take my Mac give me son Lee
right out of this I need to get a new
one okay then I'm going to take my
contour kit by Anastasia Beverly Hills
and always animals it is dark shade and
I'm eating my fan brush from Sigma so
this going to spray my faces and fixed
glass I'm going to take my guru kit from
Anasazi Beverly Hills and this is the
Sun dipped one and I'm going to shade
summer so I'm going to try this new
matte lipstick from Mac it's not new but
I know it out for some incense in court
honey love I've never tried to shade so
and then on top when I take this your
lip top light is skinny dip or it tries
to slow down okay so this is the
