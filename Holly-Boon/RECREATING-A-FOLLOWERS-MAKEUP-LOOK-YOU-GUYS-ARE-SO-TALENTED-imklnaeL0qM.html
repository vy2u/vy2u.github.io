channel and hello if you're new here
welcome hi my name is Holly Boone so
today's video I'm gonna be recreate in
one of my followers makeup looks I asked
you guys to tag me on Instagram and it
was such a hard choice some you guys are
so talented like I was scrolling through
and I was like oh my god there's so many
to choose from it's initiatic it took me
so long to choose not like so the person
I chose is Robert our makeup and his
name is Robert Riley I think so this is
a look at that he tagged me in and I was
like oh my god I love that I've never
done anything like that before so I went
to change myself and the only problem is
I don't have the bright pink that he's
used so I am probably just gonna use
purple instead I've got purple but I
don't have a bright pink so I'm gonna
use the purple instead but apart from
that if the nurse is gonna be the same
I'm gonna try my best I'm really nervous
but yeah if you go on his page oh my god
talent it's crazy so I will link Robert
Instagram down below I'm gonna use my P
Louise base as my shadow base because
it's just just so amazing for helping
color colored eyeshadows to pop it's
just amazing so I'm gonna use theirs and
we use my Mac 105 brush can I just say
real quick I'm so glad that you can't
smell my breath through the screen like
that sounds disgusting but I've just had
pickled onion crisps and my breath stink
so bad so bad I'm just no God you can't
smell my breath
yeah Roberts Instagram is just like I
cannot do so amazing oh my god I like
some of these looks I'm just like what
yeah there was so many of you that I was
just like oh my god everyone that's
hacked me the makeup was amazing my eyes
a little bit puffy today cuz like he's a
different eyelash glue and had a
reaction to it and my eyes weren't
really like swollen so yeah he's kind of
like a teal blue here in Tanaka's royal
blue
into a purple inch of pink and there's a
little bit of white where he's drawing
the line video with the lion weighs on
this
I'm gonna have to use a different color
because they don't have right pink which
is so annoying because the bright
pigments on row I'm going to use my
Judy's place in Zulu color and I'm going
to use my magic palette as well like a
mixture of the two because I don't have
all the shades in one palette
see I'm gonna start with this color
right here and this is my two three four
luck smoky shader both from zoeva I'm
just gonna start by placing this
okay I'm gonna place it and then I'm
gonna buff it out I'm just gonna place
the colors first I really hope that I do
this look Justin oh god it's so scary so
I'm going to go for this dark navy blue
color this is in the magic palette by
devious birds so I want to pick up this
on the same brush and I'm gonna place
this just underneath and decreasing in
the corner this blue might be a little
bit too dark blue is a little blue it's
more of a navy but Lucy then use my
blank canvas Etan brush and I'm gonna
start to puff that dark blue up into
that - tle color it's gonna do circular
motions and go backwards and forwards
previous base eyeshadow so just bond
right not tried them and you need to
that is so good and then using my clean
my compass efore to brush I'm going to
add some just going back to that dark
blue just gonna build it up a little bit
more but this brush this little blending
brush is so good if you want to get like
a precise blend and you just want
something really tiny this is amazing
this brush is only six pounds I'll link
it down below it's the bank canvas e 10
brush and it's like one of my favorites
I have like three of these because if
you´d is too big of a blending brush and
you go in to blend you kind of can make
it look a bit muddy by the colors kind
of blending into one and it can make it
a bit muddy and all just like you can't
see the separate colors so to get that
really precise blend you need a tiny
little
brush like this and its color Robert as
you it's gone is like a purple and then
into a pink so so I'm gonna do so yeah
I'm gonna take this purple color here
from the Zulu palette and this brush
this is my two to seven soft two finer
vegan brush from zoeva I'm gonna just
dot press this on I'm not gonna bring
this up too much so next I'm gonna do is
take my blank cumbers e time brushes in
a different one since when I just use a
minute ago I've got another one and this
one is clean but I stained proof using
orange shadow and I'm just going to
lightly go over that purple because I
want to soften it I don't want it to be
too much so I kind of kept it on the lid
and in the crease so I'm gonna pick up
some pink from the Zulu palette if
you've not had if you've not trying to
sue your palate it's balm it's so good
the colors are amazing and I'm gonna
start to blend that with okay so I'm
picking up some pink on this brush but
I'm not going in too heavy-handed
because I just want to use it to blend
out that purple at the moment I'm gonna
start to pull this pink out I'm gonna
wing it out towards the brow so I'm
gonna wipe off the excess of the brush
that pink because I don't want to add
any more color you know I now want to
diffuse it so just wiped off the excess
of the brush and I'm going back in this
really really lightly and I just go back
to that navy blue color from the magic
palette I'm just gonna press that on
there just to done not in a little bit
when working with so many colors it's
really difficult to not make it look
just like a muddy mess and to keep the
colors separate but also blended it's
really difficult
okay so I'm gonna pick up pink on that
two to seven brush I just wiped off the
purple I'm go to this brush which is
just a clean brush doesn't got anything
on earth well over there not edge this
brush was a bit of pink on it okay so
like I said I don't have the bright pink
liner so instead I'm going to use purple
because that was like the closest I had
so we're gonna do like a outline of a
wing through the crease guys it's gonna
be difficult
okay so I'm just gonna have to just go
for it
then you put my half of these Knicks
liners is some of them are okay and then
some of them really crack on the eyes
this one seems to be okay so far kind of
thought this should be a little bit
thicker
Robert deaf he didn't bring his in this
far but my just kept getting closer and
closer so I'm gonna take my Inglot Jo
liner this is my white one this is a
really really good white line I feel
looking for a good one he said like a
pink blend into a white which it's so
amazing so I'm going to try and do that
this brush by the way comes with the
dose of colors I shadow palettes it's
just like a little brush that came with
that this little end I'm using because
it's so tiny
yeah I just watched up my other eye and
then I realized that Robert put glitter
here I'm gonna use my NYX this is the
face and body glitter in the shade 10
which is like a real blue color so I'm
going to apply some glitter glue this is
the ash cosmetics glitter glue I'm gonna
apply a little bit sit up just a little
bit on too much then I'm going to use my
Sigma F 75 brush to apply that clear
okay so I am back and I did my other eye
off camera and I stuck some lashes on so
now I'm gonna finish off the under eye
so I'm gonna go straight in with that
dark blue color right there in the inner
corner to press it on so I'm using this
to leave a brush against the t34 brush
then I'm going to go to this brush I'm
gonna lightly diffuse there go so kind
of like a bold highlight here so I'm
going to just do that quick but just use
the Primark got palm up the loose
pigment then I'm going to use this liner
we're presently in the corner
you like a triangle shape try playing
brave what I'm doing this band is guys
in the in the water line we're just
we're gonna sting I'm not supposed to
put this in your water line but
nevermind and we would join it up with
that line this actually isn't it sting
in my water line which I'm quite shocked
about that and we're gonna stick lose
bits of blue tile just under here and
yeah Roberts done pink too much that's
I'm gonna do purple and I'm gonna use
this glitter which is from Barry and
it's kind of different shapes and
different colors in this so I'm just
gonna go with that
Roberts is like all the same but uh but
this is I kind of mix two random dinner
so I'm just going to use this I'm going
to use my ash cuz makes clear glue I'm
just gonna dot this as well so I'm gonna
take the end of a brush and I'm gonna
pick up some these I'm just gonna place
them
okay so I'll is obviously different my
undereye
is different obviously different vinegar
and the line is different but I actually
think I did quite well so I just
finished my other eye off-camera and did
my highlight on my lip gloss and I'm
actually really impressed if I just came
out I love love love Roberts I wish I
had that hot pink liner that he did and
the hot pink glitter I feel like it mine
would look so much better if I had that
