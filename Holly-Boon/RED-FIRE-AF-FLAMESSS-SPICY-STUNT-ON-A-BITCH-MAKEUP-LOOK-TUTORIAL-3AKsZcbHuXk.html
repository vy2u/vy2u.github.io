35o M palette it's just loads of matte
warm shades it's like one of my absolute
favorite palettes is so inexpensive but
it's always out stop which is really so
first of all I'm going to take this
shade right into my transition color and
I'm going to use my Sigma diffused
crease p-38 bra taking this shade right
here this red shade I'm going to apply
this all over the lid and I'm going to
take my Mac 217 brush I'm probably going
to build up the intensity of that first
voice when I apply a little bit so I'm
going to go in with this shade right
here in the crease and I'm going to buff
it out and I'm using my Sigma e35 take a
blending brush I used two shadows on I
don't know some of the really pigmented
is a lot and this shows not just to keep
flying up next I want to take a mixture
of these two shades right here and I'm
going to apply that to the out for a
while when I take my map two to one
I know pile a little bit of concealer
under my life so I can finish on my
under eye so I'm just using a little bit
of this heart-shaped plate and then I'm
just going to pop that in using my
tapered kabuki brush because if not I'm
just going to set that with some powder
I'm using the laura mercier translucent
okay so that's going to go over that
transition shade and across that
underneath my eyeliner and then I'm
going to go over the red let's do some
you know we try to get as close to the
lash line and then over the rough L next
I'm going to take my Mac and
fascinating.i car is just the pure white
and then whenever I see my bottom
waterline as G's a few times because
first time it comes up a bit pinky cuz
obviously the rose okay so I tell them I
was going she decided to dismantle the
fucking door downstairs it dirty fucking
out and but I just got some ashes on
these are iconic house of lashes and two
new ashes mixed together to pad and just
go away more like a full wispy lash so I
paid two anyway so just a prai little
bit more of this white in the waterline
and now I'm just going to apply some of
the benefit they are rules report on
hashes okay there we have a makeup wipe
I'm just going to wipe away that
concealer and I just used it to do my
under eyes so and then I'm just going to
buff how do you bitches IRA Hey so we
can start on the face now please excuse
my nails by the way like finger Brett I
know tragic absolute fashion era i need
feminism today I'm going to meet Imogen
we're going to get an ounce on because
my look got hot
let's probably if I'm still got short
hours probably more lasted as long as
you can't believe it and I am tempted to
go back too long I just think short now
is to see me better maybe other line
we'll see
so when I take my MJ a rehab makeup rack
this is a Hot Springs hydrating
hydrating gel I love this so thank you
so much
urban Trey for sending minutes
I'm so grateful I initially loved it so
much so it is walk based it's really
nice on the skin and it's really like
she's really hydrating agate says really
rad ralien
and it'd be perfect for users what ways
to get under our skin because it is
water-based so it's not going to make
you any more over it is super hydrating
so we're sort of quite a bit of that I'm
going to go and apply some of the pore
fessional
minimizing poor shit by benefit and the
screen up I thought is how much pores
aren't too bad lately sometimes that
will obviously days okay for my
foundation today I'm going to firstly
take my hourglass stick foundation in
golden tan I'm sorry this is so
expensive a foundation but mine actually
start in male I'm like so she's so
expensive but sort of bird is so good I
can't even do a hope it is we already
know I love that laurio tree much and
total copper mostly I got repairs run
out so you get that much oh you did like
everyday so I need to go and purchase
again and I'm sitting like 3d blender by
Sigma been since oh my god who loves
Lizzie McGuire Movie that maybe was like
everything when I was a kid and she's
everything of the King and that came out
I got back in I don't know what it was
it - this is retrieve me - no hey no hey
no I love it
I'll watch it down yes the castle
backdrop like over YouTube and I was
like a proper YouTube and I'll got these
backdrops okay so we're taking my touch
they say I don't if I like this anymore
to be honest I've heard throughout the
day it can end up looking a little bit I
don't know I don't to happen about this
a tiny on with advising animatedly I
want to try that NYX one that because a
man ends in shoes I fucking love her so
what have I to do her I love her
you know man the engine is the nyx
concealer and that it was so similar to
the M NARS radiant creamy so I need to
try that because what madness is going a
Monday is just everything if you don't
mind the engine then you mother I'll
subscribe to me because we can't be
friends
mother now if you're watching this fully
not if you are big love you all I love
you okay anyways I'm gonna take my Sigma
free Devender some blenders okay so
we're going to set that with my Laura
Mercier translucent murder
so I did like the RC my new color powder
but I don't know why it just doesn't
last very long that make sense
like I apply it and then about half an
hour later I get oily again join me just
like it doesn't really I don't know like
we're going to mention anyone I'll
powder my face and I'm waiting to powder
my face for hours okay so I'm going to
take my iconic London pigment stick and
show you three point one's going to use
this to warm my face a little bit out
from of my vein again in this brush as
well from my clinic underneath it's a
little I think no be so good at blending
this in I'm going to take my Mac dark
deep mineralized skinfinish I actually
said at this time in my last video that
in this mood okay so okay so yummy yes
and this is the mac 135 brush this which
is really good yes I'm just going to
press this in swear I've eyes up cream
okay you guys after update time so I
still have a bit of a town for my
holiday like I'm quite good at
maintaining my turn that whenever our
holiday I'm always moisturize and stuff
to keep my sound when I get back so not
clean my car has pretty much stayed but
probably give it another couple of weeks
and I'll we have faded so I walk about
YouTube a turn and the only photon that
I reach for is love in terms I'm going
right here I've got a little mini whoo
- neither mini hula forms of Oh benefits
okay so to contact I'm going to take my
Sigma powder brushes to f10 so I'm just
going to close to my forehead my -
before head shot several it's got a five
finger forehead over glow do I even need
to say it do I even say it
guess what is obviously why I call it
love the new hair drops I can't I cannot
use not use these you know I mean I
forgot my highlight without the istic
shit
so I wear this it's like denovo Mahalo
so yeah these are the original shade I
decide to do a three shades and out
which is so good did you have a discount
code fully b10 you get one else yes -
they'll see what I mean it just which is
underneath your power to highlight it
just makes a difference you can't even
express I say motto for cosmetics this
is a nikkietutorials highlight I love
this so much is it's a popping highlight
and when I spray my brush with stem with
the matchstick spawn I'm actually going
to try this morphe r-36 brush and I'm
going to take this a mixture of these
two shades okay so I'm just going to
wipe all your product off with it I'm
going to apply them with a Mac peach
stock lipstick just it's to the tiniest
bit I'm just going to kind of spread it
and then I'm going to take my Mac lip
conditioner - not gloss it's a
conditioner but well it's very dry
