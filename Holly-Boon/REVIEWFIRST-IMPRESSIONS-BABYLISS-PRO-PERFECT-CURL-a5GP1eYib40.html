a fasting russians review of this
babiness random curling machinee thing
it looks scary but I want to try
it I feel like I have bad memories from
this brand though because when I was
like 6 or 7 I had that braided machine
where you put three pieces of hair in it
you press a button it's supposed to
braid your hair and it will bind I'm not
I did my hair that will might eat in my
hair I'm going to cut it out I thought
if anybody else ever had that machine
but that me for life that
me for life
also did anyone ever have that pink
curling song with the steam on the top
they use that to fill up with water you
screw it on your curling Tong curl your
hand and press the little thing to steam
your hair and then my hey to be correct
like crispy after that as I've my
Nana some machines I'm not very good
with these types of machine things but
I'm going to shut the up and get on
with it
I read the instructions already and I've
just I'm turnin going to turn it on to
get up there so I've just read the
instructions so we're gonna give this a
go
apparently it's not for really long hair
this is in the instructions and my hair
is like 22 inch so otherwise we see
others anyways I'm scared
look how scary look let's get my hair's
going to suck in this Oh always uses by
this size facing towards the head okay
so I'm guessing like that okay it's heat
it up let's let's do this so you take a
little bit of her okay
oh well there is gone it's good yes it
works yes okay so if you put too much
hair in it or make a beeping noise
straightaway which means it's too much
hair I get worried shut the hell up
you get my minutes I'll think you have
to use quite segments of half this is
weird it's the weirdest thing
it works though it works let's like that
it works I've had 120 palace for this if
it wasn't a wife I was going to be
furious we're going to be fuming okay
she's going to continue to take forever
to kind of one hand out so much ask well
it's not much extension it is prettier
to say where it's really good though I
really like it I didn't think I'd like
it because device things that is never
worked for me like the whole Bri
situation that braiding machine was
lethal I just remember putting my hair
in it my mom wants me for Christmas and
I was it oh and there's your own bar I
just remember putting my hair in it
pressing the button it was but stopping
my hair I'm always cutting my hair to
get out yeah that's too much hair to do
half a lot I feel you're doing thing I
don't really like small small curls I
like my house to be a bit thicker so if
you want thicker cows and this is not
going to work this is literally gonna
take me a lifetime to coma her I just
want to try to fit like a bit of thick a
bit of hair in
I don't like it when it's like very thin
ah my hands jammed my I jumped Wow Wow
look at this in my hat Singlish stands
in my hair I think I'll ask machine
anymore
you're funny but I gosh it's tough all
my buddies actually stop the headstock
she's not afraid didn't sing all over
again
what is stop ah great it's just
ripped my hair out okay I thought the
singing part have to be so careful today
and hopefully we reduce again gets
jammed again that's it okay and move all
right
I can't be my head foot jammed in this
pop it smells like it's not that budded
it's nothing burnin this is just scary
I feel like maybe it worked out because
I had my hair is a bit naughty maybe
that's a bit of curl oh I think it's
included need to make sure the thing
that what I know think that's not in my
hair but the roses maybe you can't I'm
not you have also you can't and what you
hear you 12
oh okay works now you got all make sure
you have not no I mean the girl of the
thing that's got big hair did they've
really use this with her hair I think
the lion okay well I'm going to finish
up the rest of my hair and then come
back and show you what it looks like and
just give you a final review on it so
I'll see you in a second
I've had that I I'm shook look at my
hair you look so good you so curly I
don't have my Parliament's I've just
shoved it with one side okay so I feel
like the more I used it certain
apartment personal take notes on mana
it's just all over the place okay so I'm
sort of part of that in a minute but I'm
actually shook I'm so shook it's
actually so good the more I used in the
more as I okay like I was kind of
getting the hang of it I had to use it
you have to be careful with like the
sizes of pieces of hair that you use so
you can't use a bit a bit is too big and
also you want to make sure you brush
through the hair before you put it in
there because this is a little bit not
it'll get tangled in the Machine and
that's how my hair got tangled but it's
actually so good
and it was really quick as well why you
could get immediate it was on so
I really just convinced myself that 120
pounds was definitely worth it because
look at my hair you look sick it
expanses what I've done is having been
started yeah I've just killed it I said
and I managed to get biggest biggest
strands of hair to go through the
machine you just have to make sure that
it's brushed them as they knots in it
that tie gets jammed in the machine it's
really good so yeah I went from not
seeing it too much - I love it now yeah
