this two-faced anti-crease eyeshadow
primer it's definitely a favor of mine
at the moment I do pretty much use this
one all the time lately so yeah now
using the semi-sweet chocolate palette
i'm just using shade peanut butter and
i'm just working this into the crease
from my transition color and the brush
i'm using is the sigma e35 brush and now
i'm just blending that out with my Kiko
blending brush
so now using the two-faced Stardust
palette by Vegas nay
I'm just taking shade girls night and
I'm just using my Sigma e 37 brush I'm
just going to apply this to the outer
corner of my eye and then work some of
that into the crease I'm now taking my
Sigma e35 brush I'm just gonna blend
those two shades together next taking my
mac 242 brush I'm going to be using
shade showgirl and I'm just gonna apply
some fix+ to the brush before I apply
this shade it just makes it look a lot
more pigmented and so I'm just gonna
apply this from the inner corner to
about halfway and then I'm gonna take my
sigma e35 brush and just blend that all
together
so now going in with the Sigma gel
eyeliner and the wings eyeliner brush
which is the eo6 brush I'm just going to
create a winged eyeliner if you find I'm
doing wings eyeliner quite difficult
than I do highly recommend this brush
it's so easy to use if you do it this
way I just think it's brilliant so yeah
now I'm just applying some of the Rimmel
London volume flash mascara before I
apply my false lashes so you want to let
the glue dry for a little bit before you
apply the false lashes just because it
makes it a lot easier here I've tried to
fire them quite wet and it was a bit of
a nightmare bit yeah
next to prime my face
I'm using the Nivea for men post shave
balm
I heard nikkietutorials talk about this
and I've been using it for the last sort
of 2-3 weeks and I'm really really
impressed a bit so I would highly
recommend using this for a primer
definitely so now using the Maybelline
fit me concealer I'm just going to apply
some concealer to my spots before I
apply my foundation and so I stupidly
went and popped this spot on my lip
really really hard and it's a bit the
skin and now I have a scab which is so
cute not but then I'm just going to go
in with the Mac Studio Fix fluid in NC
35 and my Sigma 3d HD kabuki brush
now using the Becca
under eye corrector I'm just going to
use this under my eye to get rid of any
dark circles
now going in with the Maybelline fit me
concealer I'm just gonna apply this to
under my eyes stand the bridge of my
nose a little bit of my forehead my
Cupid's bow and then I'm just gonna
blend that in with my Beauty Blender
now just to set my face I'm gonna take
the Mac setting powder and the Real
Techniques buffing brush I'm just going
to apply this all over my face
now taking shade cinnamon from the
Anastasia Beverly Hills contour palette
I'm just gonna use this to contour and
this is just an angled fluffy brush
okay so I'm seriously seriously
seriously obsessed with this highlighter
this is the sleek highlighter palette
and I'm just taking that goldish color
and I'm just applying this to my
cheekbones and the end of my nose and
also my brow bone so now using this
Sigma brush I'm just gonna apply this to
the apples of my cheeks I normally find
it quite hard to find brushes that I
like and but this one's quite subtle so
I absolutely love this one so yeah so
now taking whatever product is left on
the sake of my e35 brush I'm just gonna
apply that to my under eye and then I'm
just gonna replace them a mascara as
well
I'm now using the Sigma a 54 brush I'm
just gonna apply some of that highlight
site into the inner corner of my eye so
I'm not just gonna line my lips and fill
them in with the Mac spice lip liner and
then I'm gonna apply the lip line
cosmetics breezy shade and I'm just
gonna apply that to my lips as well just
to lighten it up a little bit and then
I'm also gonna go in my mac lipglass
over the top just to give a really nice
glossy finish
and lastly I'll just surprise some
eyeliner to my waterline just because I
figured it would look better so yeah so
hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial and
I will see you again next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
