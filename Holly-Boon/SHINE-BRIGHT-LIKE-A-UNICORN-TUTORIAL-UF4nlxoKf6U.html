the unicorn make off it's that phrase on
Instagram and my snapchat loads of you
requested to see it so that's what I'm
gonna be filming today so yeah it's
tight right away I've already done my
eyebrows of obvious day I always do my
eyebrows first I've got my bracket over
on my channel but I do you think I'm
whenever you do another one just cuz
I've changed it's not even not really
but I still do a better video yeah so I
am just gonna start off using the meat
map palette and i'm gonna use che map
lopez which is this shade here which i'm
gonna use for a transition color i know
i'm using like pinks and purples but i
still like to use the light brown for a
transition color i just cuz i think it
makes it blend out a lot nicer and it
just makes it a lot easier uh yeah so
i'm gonna be taking my Sigma tapered
blending brush this is the e35 brush
okay so once you've done that huh well
then take in these eyeshadows are just
so random I'm using the meat map palette
and I'm also gonna use this warm
spectrum palette by zueva
oh I'm gonna take this purple shade
right here I'm just going to use the
same brush I'm just gonna apply that in
my crease
so glitter yeah so I'm gonna use the
liquid sugar base by eye candy cosmetics
and I'm gonna be using the glitter
called double bubble by eye candy as
well I've lost the lid must be in here
somewhere in my drawer somewhere but
also did it so I don't want to like tip
it up but it's like pink keeper for grip
up stay nice so the first thing I like
to do is with this glitter glue is I'm
so applied to this my Mac to go to brush
and apply it over my lid before I apply
the glitter on it so I'm just gonna put
some of this on this brush and then I'm
just gonna apply it straight over my lid
so it my lids
where and then I'm going to take this
brush apply some glitter to the brush
like this and then just apply it to my
lid
they're going to take the glam crystals
doesn't injera liner by collection I
suppose you call collection 2000 in a
now it's called collection I'm prepared
it's gonna take this gel liner and I'm
just going to cut the crease say I'm
sorry start from here
then gonna take the pure white chroma
line by Mac and the zoeva wings liner
brush it's going to take some of this
white line on this brush and it's just
gonna connect day it due to caught eyes
yes okay okay so now I'm just going to
apply some mascara I'm using the Mac
extended play mascara is my favorite
this makeup look is so extra
so for lashes I'm gonna peas in their
house of lash ikonics
as always I'm obsessed we're just
reading your tweets while my lashes are
iron and you guys are so cute I read all
of them are always trying favorite
retail on like shout out to chuckling
Fred della cannot stop watching honeys
YouTube videos and there's windows put
nose even for that look so beautiful
definitely do it you do it real oh that
creases cut in literally I love you oh
you're so nice to me back to lashes we
wanna do like her and I'll be like it's
not Chuck you and I think I really
enjoyed filming our it was really fun
alright we're gonna move on to the face
so for primer when you use the Smashbox
photo finish primer water to spray my
face of this because I want to be super
hydrated someone who's the map my face
is remarkable
somebody is the muck tank is remarkable
in shade honey medium I love this
foundation been using it all the time
I recently got say this brush from Ava
cause my ex this is the io6 brush um
this is the first time you try and
granite you guys know if it I think is
any good obviously the artists artis
brushes and the Mac brushes of these are
really expensive so I think this one is
cheaper I'm not entirely sure
but I'm just gonna try it anyway I think
you guys know I think if it's good news
cheap art that's always a brainer Hey
hi Anna noob is the brush on the
foundation which made the foundation
carpet weird I think is probably the
foundation I think with this foundation
it's probably best to use a Beauty
Blender and one thing we can say that as
always we use the Maybelline fit me
concealer
they used to have a friend that would
argue with me about the fact that she
would be like oh I wanna highlight my
under eyes I need to get out the lights
cause like I'm fine I used to like no
that's not what you need to do you do
not want to do that because you'll just
have grey under your eyes that is not
cute it's used to argue me into anyways
I've somehow whether I would let you
have gray under eye suite you can't be
seen with me bitch I'm not just saying
this with my normative trustees and say
powder
I don't worry as you know sorry for
bronzer as always and use a Mac give me
some if you've not tried this a high
recommend trying it I'm obsessed and a
meeting D is a weaver 186 powder brush
anything with this is that a little bit
goes a long way and I get it is very
pigmented so you end up going a bit
crazy with that like I do sometimes I
don't like to you I look boring it's
really warm so he just needs to be
really careful that you don't go crazy
so the contour money is the Taylor blue
buy a hot mess contour kits my favorite
thing to contour with at the moment
absolutely obsessed of it it's so much
like the other Stacy beverly hills one
but literally Thomas Cooper so I'm gonna
take trade six and I'm going to take my
duo fiber brush by Sigma to apply this
if you find that when you apply consul
and bronzers and stuff that it goes a
bit kind of like patchy it zero because
of the brush or it can because of the
powder but I highly recommend trying to
do a fiber brush to apply it because
since I've been using a duo fiber brush
I should apply it it just apply so much
nice that I have that problem so if you
have that issue you didn't get yourself
a duo fiber brush
this another technique for you guys if
you want to enhance your cheekbones and
when you suck your cheeks in are this in
this little hollow bit here
apply some contour in there I'll show
you the difference between this side and
this side so I'm gonna drop in this on
this side ready can you see the
difference can you see it admits from
that side to that side map nervous I
look more sucks in this side and not so
much this side so I'm some do say myself
yes cheekbones come from rouhani so now
I'm gonna finish up the eyes before I
apply highlighter so it's gonna try some
of the Mac extended play masks are up
it's now gonna focus on the under-eye so
that's the room when it's makeup my
under-eye using that purple shade from
the warm spectrum palette yes if it's
purple shade right here just smoke out
my under online and just smoke the
out of your under-eye
but as you smoke the out of you on
dry I'm gonna take the back teeth hood
to brush I'm going to apply it
 turning that onto your eyes off so
you're gonna take the little glue again
and apply it to the brush apply to my
two boys to your brush just wet your
under eye with the glue so I don't see
it in your eyes it stings like a bastard
and then take the glitter until you've
used to hold it because they usually get
like never anyone flip all over your
eyeball taking please don't do that they
set it up
I don't be having sponsible for any one
kid in this house I am gonna provide
some scars my bottom lashes
so after that I'm going to take my
winged liner brush spies the Weaver and
the Matt krohmer line I'm just going to
apply that in my waterline okay so once
you've done that I'm then gonna apply
highlighter away from my
thing so I'm going to use the tapered
highlight brush by Sigma and I'm going
to use Jacqueline Hills champagne pop
just gonna spray the brush so that
unicloset always like obviously super
highlight in a glittery so you just want
to go in
so for lips I'm gonna show you two
different options so the first option
which is what I would choose because I
like to be extra extra is the lip land
double down just powerful shade I'm
going to show you what this one looks
like
this is the first options if you want to
be super unicorn life then you can do in
this lip but if not I'll show you
another lip that you can do then I'm
going to use the meet matte lips liquid
lipstick and this is in shade sincere
this lip color looks really really good
with this eye look as well I'd say yeah
this is the second lip option so you can
either go for a double down by lip bland
to be extra extra or you can use the
meet matte lipstick liquid lipstick
insincere but there's like loads of
different because you can use with this
i love it you could go for any from
pinky perfectly
anything nude anything that you wanna do
but yeah that is the finished look hope
