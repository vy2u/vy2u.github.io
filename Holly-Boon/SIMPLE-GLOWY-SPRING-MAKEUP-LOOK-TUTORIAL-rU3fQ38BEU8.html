that look it up
stop it let's 1902 you look so so so hey
guys welcome back to my youtube channel
and hello hi if you're new here
my name is Holly Boone so in today's
video I'm gonna be doing a spring glowy
makeup look or why'd you read glowy skin
and then something kind of soft and
blown up on the eyes maybe something
like pinky peachy that kind of thing
yeah I have got contact lenses in
because I love switched on when I color
i I just love it I think this I color
looks really nice with pinks and peaches
on the ice so that's what way today it
also does it also brown eyes but I just
thought it's what you don't open and
then you know I mean so the first thing
I'm gonna do is my eyebrows so I'm gonna
use my NYX micro brow pencil I love this
brow pen so it's my life and when you
first get it and it's new it's a little
bit stiff so I was just kind of like
scribble on the back of my hand before
you use it start by I'm lining my brow
I've talked to my brow way too thin can
we not I've got a bit too carried away
with the tweezers let's just ignore that
say I'm gonna just underline my brow
luckily my brows growing back really
fast as soon as I do go a bit crazy with
the tweezers I felt out because this
side just doesn't grow as fast as this
side I try to make this side of Italy as
much that so but I don't think even
matches now okay then I'm gonna just
follow the natural shape of my brow top
and then I'm just gonna start to apply
the product throughout the brow as well
where am i right then to me anyway with
this top my bright I need you a tiny you
might have put up if I let you down for
any pressure I would applying it
one thing I struggle with the most is
getting my brows even because they grow
so different like they stock both the
style of erisa completely differently
the hairs on this side pointing that way
and their heads on this side putting
upwards it's just annoying this one
takes so much longer super over to our
other side gonna put some brow gel
through my brows I'm gonna use what
anastasi buddy has clear brow gel this
one is my favorite
keeps my head in place all day I've used
it for the longest time like over here I
just love it
okay so I'm gonna start on my skin
because I don't need too much on my eyes
I want to keep it really soft and
already blown out I want the main focus
to be going yeah skin the first thing
I'm gonna do is prime I'm gonna use my
wire cell or ours primer I love this
stuff so much I never used to believe in
primer and then I started using this and
it minimizes my pause it keeps on makeup
on all day and it also stops you from
getting it's the best thing about
so this is the early primer that
actually works for me
what the I try so many primers and
this is the only one that she does what
it says it's gonna do I have heard that
this does have an ingredient in it which
may cause you should break out I'm gonna
keep your thing and I have got break out
here but I think it's because hormones
also makes my skin smooth there's all my
skin really glowy and I can't use like
Jewish foundations or anything about
that because I have oily so have to
create the glowy look through a liquid
highlight or powder to highlight that
kind of thing so I'm gonna use my iconic
London illuminator drops in the street
original I'm gonna put some of these on
underneath my foundation so I'm just
gonna pour some on the back of my hand
like this and I'm just gonna apply this
to my cheekbone area it's gonna rub it
in my finger so yeah because I don't
really I can't
music Jewish foundation so I like to do
this just like on my cheekbones and
where I want a look really highlighted
so just above my brow I like a bit of
glow there liquid
it's one of those things that I cannot
leave out when it's spring some are I
live in it I've drenched myself in it I
mix it my moisturizers and put all over
my body I am obsessed it's one thing
that I absolutely love when it's spring
summer we've added the glow on this skin
and now I'm going to apply a foundation
so I'm going to use my Maybelline 24
hour State foundation in the shade
caramel beige I love this foundation
especially with this primer because
before I love dis her nation but what I
would find is after sort of like six
five six hours I was a little bit shiny
but looked a little bit greasy but it is
primer underneath keeps me mat and non
shiny throughout the day which was
amazing so this foundation is my
favorite everyday like for everyday
foundation I literally love it it's
amazing and it's affordable as eye which
we don't I love it because it's a full
coverage but it doesn't feel like a
it doesn't feel heavy on the skin feels
nice and it wears a really really well
with this primer like I said I've been
getting confirmation my skin oh my god
like what of you don't your skin I'm
like trust me it's that primer with this
foundation I said like it's like a magic
some sort of magic like a Russian
person it's mad okay so for concealer
I'm gonna use my Laura Mercier ultra
longwear concealer I have been obsessed
with this since I tried it I have it
she's been wearing this every single day
since I tried it it is so bomb I'm
obsessed
it's long wear it first so that way it's
a full coverage just so nice so I love
the applicator as well it's nice and
soft
I used the shade 3w which is perfect
shade for me under the eyes I actually
love planar and when I color so much fun
good if it's um just in the middle of my
forehead yeah and I'm gonna bring it
down the bridge of my eyes as well
aren't if a tiny bit on my chin it's
just to kind of balance it all out um I
don't really like to highlight in that
way because I got a big chin so
when you use my beer and and I want to
press it
err
and I'm gonna bring it up over my eyes
the reason why I'm not going to use the
peeler with eyeshadow base because I'm
doing a soft eye look the pillow is
eyeshadow base is amazing if you want a
ton of pigment on the eyes why wouldn't
it look really soft so I'm not going to
use the peel away space today but if
you're looking for an eyeshadow base
it's gonna make your eyeshadow look so
bangin like so bright and bold and so
much pigment then you definitely need
that basis yes next that will share its
next up we share I just love the way
this concealer looks in this foundation
as well I am just obsessed definitely
money favorite concealer huh I feel like
it gives me a bit more coverage Sunday
make a revolution one is art if it was a
lot more comfortable than the makeup
revolution one I don't even feel like
I'm really wearing a high D any
concealer at all like a flat ass in fake
brushes the mac 105 brush I take a
little bit of that concealer and I'm
gonna carve up my brows and want my
brows look sharp just flat synthetic
brush from Mac is so good for this
carving out brows and stuff it's like
the best I can't really worry about
pushing and Pete you've been on top of
my time and I've got contact lenses him
tough but like it's gonna roll back into
my head
that happened to one of my friends while
it's they put one some in for Holloway
and it went into the back of our eye
okay so what I'm gonna do now before I
set the creams I'm gonna cream bronze
but I'm going to use my Laura Mercier
concealer in the shade 6w I'm gonna
apply this to the outer part of my face
so my forehead basically where you want
to contour as well I'm going to apply
this I'm not necessarily creating shadow
I'm kind of just I'm just warming up the
outer part of my face so I'm gonna use
my Beauty Blender and I'm gonna press
this in because we have the excess
foundation on the bottom it really helps
to render and really easy so I always
thought how ever used for your
foundation you used to blend in if
you're doing this because it makes it so
much easier and it renders
so much quicker who say one thing who
all says if you find it hard to get a
bronzy skin with just a powder which I
sometimes digs I feel like you build up
so much powder trying to get really
bronze your skin it sometimes looks
really powdery cakey so I always just
recommend doing this which I do is a
cream underneath and then you only need
to put a tiny bit of powder on top just
to say okay so we look ronzi as and
we've just used creams which like I said
works so much better if you want really
grungy skin and I'm gonna set my under
eye I'm going to use my Patrick Starr
powder by Mac I love this it has a
peachy undertone to it so really helps
to brighten up the under eye so I'm
gonna take my sponge I'm gonna just
press that under the eye I'm not gonna
bring it in this area here I'm just
gonna apply it just under my eye and
just in this little corner here because
we're going to apply liquid highlight
there and sometimes when you probably
would highlight over powder it looks a
mess so we're just going to avoid this
area here the cheek we're just gonna
apply some on my eyelids as well it's a
tiny bit see I'm just staying in this
little corner here I'm not playing it in
the cheekbone area so ready runs up I'm
gonna use the same thing as always
broken record I know it's really
annoying my Mac mineralized skinfinish
in the shade up deep and this NYX fluffy
brush I'm just gonna press it on top of
where I applied that cream so just gonna
set that so before I finish the skin
before we do with the highlight the
blush the all that kind of stuff I'm
gonna start on my eyes see yeah like I
said I want kind of like a peachy like a
soft peachy kind of look on the eyes so
I'm going to use my morphe 35o palette
and I'm gonna first take this pink color
hair it's really like baby pink and this
is my Sigma diffused crease Etha a brush
and I'm gonna start to apply this just
above my crease and I'm gonna put it all
the way out so just do circular motions
I'm gonna bring it all the way in see in
a corner as well and I'm keeping it just
above my crease I'm just gonna build
I hope until them happy as I made you
the same on the other side I literally
love this palette there's morphe 35o
palette so much color in it I love it
see how just circular motions and then
put it out again on the side I just
realized that I should probably be face
on so you can see exactly won't it so
don't want to build it up too much
because I want you to look soft and like
diffused and that kind of look and then
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take this
color right here which is such a nice
peachy orange color I'm gonna pick some
this up on my Lux classic shader - 3 -
brush and I'm gonna pack this on the lid
and again I'm gonna bring it out as well
I'm really like nice and diffused and
just soft so I'm not going to pack on
too much in one place I'm gonna evenly
dispersed it and keep it quite soft and
then I'm gonna go back to my Sigma V
fate 8 brush and I'm gonna blend that it
screams Easter Easter so I'm gonna do
the same on the other side I'm just
gonna pack on the color evenly and
really lightly because I'm sick I don't
want to fight - watch big man I want to
keep it nice and stop then I'm gonna go
back to this
Etha get diffused crease brush then that
just orange color is everything I take
the pink color eats fast and I'm gonna
run this underneath the eye and again
I'm springing it all the way out here I
feel I pull the weirdest faces when I'm
doing my mascara on my lower lash line
for eyeshadow how much ok then I'm going
to go to that peachy orange color and
I'm gonna apply this closer to the lash
line my nail color is so boring can we
know why did I get nude I'm really sure
reason why I've got short nerves at the
minute is because I ruined my
actual nails from wearing extensions all
the time and I used to break them all
the time because I'd get them
caught on things and I snap my nail and
my room nerves underneath was so weak so
recently I've been getting a credit on
top of my natural nail and keeping it
short and I'm not asking about it but I
do need to get a better color at this
new just psyched too boring for me but
I'm actually not mad actually quite like
them sure because I don't ones I just
used to catch them on everything I live
for long nails though so I'm very line
my lashline with some black liner I'm
going to use my lasting drama toner from
Maybelline like this love this stuff
it's brilliant and just press
this along the lash line I don't want it
to be too thick so I'm just pressing it
and I'm going to apply it in my top
waterline and try not to poke myself in
the eye so I'm just gonna press this on
white that's why I was reading a book
last night I was up so like reading it
it's called get rich you lucky bitch
just something I think that's what it's
called and it's so good like you
guys need to read it is so good it's
just about like your mindset and how you
can manifest money and success then
there's all different tips in there it
doesn't make you think but you change
the way I think about things you know
yeah you know me I love a good
motivational inspirational book I'm
obsessed just think they're so inspiring
to reach different people success
stories I find it so inspiring I'm just
applying some bud Gallup a ban mascara
from benefit love it so I'm gonna use my
house of lashes this is a Natalia lash I
love them I think I'm not really good
with this and I'm gonna use my house of
lashes eyelash gray so when I think my
lashes too dried out for a minute I
won't forget up on my son won't forget
this time I not forget every time I
promise I won't forget and so I'm gonna
take this little beauty vendor that I
got I still pink today okay pink theme
we love it
this little one and I'm gonna use this
for a while
could highlight once gonna spray it with
some fix+ this is my coconut one
I'm just going to dump it and yeah I'm
gonna use this to prime way iconic
content lumen it drops because I find
the big one just is too big and it just
makes it go everywhere I'm just gonna
keep applying it and toilet like
glowing goddess just above the brow I do
definitely prefer this little sponge
it's easier
I love these illuminate drops because I
love my glow to look glowy and not
powdery on the skin and this really
really does that like this looks next
level I'm just doing outside my stuff
blush hey how do today woodsy
highlight first then with a blush no
worries no worries no problem not a
problem so I'm gonna use my anastasi on
Beverly Hills and breezy highlight I
love this it's so bomb yeah you don't
you guys spend the money on this any
highlight on top of this glow this
liquid glow lip balms so I'm gonna
actually just dip my sponge in here and
press it on top we do want to fire
powder on top because we want to kind of
set it we don't slide around and and
also it intensifies it so look at that
and it looks nice and doing it doesn't
look powdery because I put that liquid
underneath the liquid underneath is key
to a nice glowy high light rather than a
powder and highlight call me
crazy but I'm gonna mix these two shades
here which are these peachy colors and
when you use it as blush on this brush
I'm going to just tap off the excess but
I want my brush to match my eyes so I
want like a peach and I'm gonna have a
peach I'm going to price the apples and
I do like to bring it all the way back
here as well and this is the NYX eye for
brush tell me switch it mixing those two
peachy colors together
okay I'm gonna stick my lashes on now
before I forget because you know I won't
forget oh well done dickhead you stuck
it on the wrong
can i what kind of idiot does
that me I see me
okay lashes are on finally okay this is
actually a lip liner but I want to use
in my eye I don't know if this is gonna
hurt me or whatever but I'm gonna try it
so I'm just gonna apply this on my water
cuz I want this sort of color in my I
don't have a pencil like this
yeah Alex say it
okay so for my bottom lash it is I'm
gonna use my bad girl bang mascara
it's my NYX lip liner in the shade
London climate isn't this then I'm gonna
use my NYX lingerie dusk-to-dawn liquid
lipstick nothing to Dora's the color I
said it well back when sorry you could
leave it now if you want it look color I
know a lot of people don't like gloss
but I love a gloss as you guys know I'm
going to add my peaches and cream lip
gloss in the shade honey honey I'm home
I was such a twerp okay I love this
class oh my god it's so good so I'm
going to do liquid glow on my body
because I'm just I want to be a glowing
 goddess
so I'm going to use my liquid
illuminated drops again put some on the
back of my hand probably need that much
just waiting for that well done right
and I'm gonna take my big sponge and
it's gonna fight to my collarbone area
do a little bit on this side but what
the top comes up this is like a one
sleeve top and goes at that I read I
